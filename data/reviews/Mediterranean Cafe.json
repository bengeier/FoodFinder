{"text":"Lamb and beef shwarma plate all day. Don't forget to ask for hot sauce! One of the dankest restaurants in Madison. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch locations on State Street. The food is authentic and the staff is very friendly. I would recommend the lamb plate. Beware though: they don't have the best hours and only accept cash!"}
{"text":"Dont take orders by phone. For someone who was ordering a surprise lunch pickup from South Carolina, that was not helpful"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant during lunch hour for one thing and one thing only: the $5.50 Akin's Plate with beef/lamb served on a bed of yellow rice (not sure what makes it yellow, saffron I'm guessing), tomato/cucumber salad, and the white sauce (tzatziki??). Yum..
And if you're like me who doesn't enjoy her foods to be smothered by anything saucy, you can get the sauce on the side. Super Yummy with a big capital Y. Best bang for your buck, seriously..!!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, scads of vegetarian options, and friendly owners make up for the crampitude. Excellent Greek salad and spanikopita, great value... it genuinely feels like that little ethnic cafe you discover two corners down from your Paris apartment."}
{"text":"State St. traditions haven't all been corporatized just yet! The folks working at Med Cafe, including the owner, are the salt of the earth. Always a pleasure walking in. I love the tea and the spinach pie as much as anyone. The falafel is hit-and-miss but I still prefer it to the other spots on State."}
{"text":"That's what mediterranean food really tastes like!! This place has (by far) the best hummus and lamb shawarma in all Madison!! 
Trust me... I lived in the middle east for 25 years!!"}
{"text":"Don't listen to the haters - this place is great!  The owner is super-friendly, always takes good care of me and my wife, and the food is fantastic.  I always have the lamb shawarma, as it's so good I can never seem to try anything else.  I should force myself (but I know I'll regret not getting it even once!) so I can speak more broadly about the menu.  The hummus is super-creamy and flavorful.  the meat is always moist and tender, fresh off the rotating meat thingy, and even the salad is a nice, tangy counterpoint to the other flavors on the plate.

We tend to go here mid-afternoon, which is probably a lot more relaxed than a typical college lunch-hour would be.  The food is worth lingering over.  Recommend highly!"}
{"text":"If we could give one half of a star, we would. The half would be for the fountain soda. 

The falafel sandwich was cold. Apparently tossing the log of lavash, tahini and random pickle into the microwave was too much for the staff to handle on a Tuesday afternoon. The falafel themselves were unsavory, bland and cold. 

The hummus was mostly tahini. Absent were the flavors of chickpeas, lemon, or salt. Salt, the most basic of seasonings! The tastiest, perhaps. On top of the flavorless shellac was a drizzle of olive oil. Its only purpose was, seemingly, to run blindly away from the edges of the pita bread that we dragged through it. 

The \"vegan lentil soup\" was essentially tomato juice and canned lentils.

Avoid, avoid, avoid.

If you are looking for a plate of yellow rice or the multi-continental delicacy that is the gyro, do come here, flock here as the wayward tribes of UW are content to, otherwise, look up a few recipes on line and have at it... spices go a long way... as does the home microwave. 

Our motto is: if we can make it at home, we shouldn't be paying for it at a restaurant. The fact is, we could make food 100% better than the Mediterranean Caf√©, and so can you! 

The food is dreck. It is trash. It is unfathomable that anyone would pay good cash money for eating this \"food.\""}
{"text":"Great, inexpensive food. The only downside is the limited seating, but I suppose that's part of its charm."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite place on campus, but make sure you bring cash, and go during lunch time, because they close for dinner. 

The serving is huge, I always have leftovers, unless I chose to stuff myself, which in that case I would end up going without dinner that day. Service is good, they recognize me after a couple of visits and know which dishes are your usual go-tos. I also like their decos and music, giving a good vibe as you are enjoying your food and conversation with your company. 

Beef and lamb shwarma plates, atkins plate, moussaka and the roti chicken are my favorite dishes. The last two are daily specials so they are not necessary served everyday. Their lentil soup is great too, if you feel like having something light. 

So next time you are walking along state st, or are just looking for a lunch place, do give this a try. During peak lunch hours the line is long, but it goes fast. So if you choose to take your food to-go, this is not a problem at all."}
{"text":"Med Cafe is great, the lamb shawarma is delicious. Takeout is usually more convenient, as seating is a little limited. Oh, and they really should take cards. But they don't."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp!   Another great choice not too far off I-39.  Food was great, we had the chicken schwarma plates.  Food came very quick,  You will need to park and walk to the location.  Would definately come back again if in the area."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious, lunchtime Mediterranean fare.  All your favorites are here.  Watch out as they may franchise this place around the country.

Warning:  when they close, they close, period.  With the continuous crowd, they don't have to cater to malingerers or late-comers."}
{"text":"The place offers unique and savory  dishes with competitive pricing, decorative environment. Tables are small yet the Crimson toned environment and furnishing creates a warm and comfortable atmosphere. Great location for a easy brunch."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time after hearing so many good recommendations from my friends the last couple of years. Even with high expectations, I was not disappointed. The service was extremely friendly and fast, and the food is just absolutely delicious! I had a lamb schwarma plate. The lamb was crisp and well-seasoned, the yogurt sauce was sublime, and the vegetables were fresh. Salad dressing is homade and amazing-the best I've had in Madison so far. And lastly, the flatbread was crispy and freshly baked.

Come and eat here and experience it for yourself. It is one of Madison's best."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Madison for lunch. Period. The food is fresh, flavorful and the owner and staff are really kind and humble. They operate like one happy family. The baklava is to-die-for! Make sure that you get cash and only grab a seat once you have ordered. This would definitely rank among the best meals that you would have in a while!

The owner is really considerate and told me that he had a hunch that I would show up on a Wednesday and made my favorite Roti chicken even though that was not on the menu for the day. Love it!"}
{"text":"Med Cafe is one of the most delicious places if you are looking for a quick and inexpensive meal downtown. Don't let the prices fool you, the portions are great and the food is amazing. I always get the same thing: the chicken shawarma plate. Comes with pita bread, a salad, hummus, rice and delicious chicken; all for around $7-8. Food is made fresh and comes fast!

Don't let the looks of this place fool you, its small with less than great decor. But the food and the service more than makes up for it!!

It gets super crowded around lunchtime, especially during the school year. So be prepared!"}
{"text":"Although you may see a line out the door, fret not Med Cafe makes sure you are served quickly. On a spring summer or fall day I would recommend taking your food to go and sit on Library Mall because the seating is quite cozy on the inside. 

As I am sure many other reviewers have already said Med Cafe has the best hummus in Madison. Without a doubt the creamiest and most delectable hummus I have had in Wisconsin. 

I usually get the Med Wrap which is vegetarian. It is light and great for lunch (since Med Cafe closes at four otherwise it would be good for any occasion), because its portable and scrumptious!"}
{"text":"Lamb/beef shawarma!  Fast/friendly service!  Cheap/affordable food!  Easy/convenient location!

What/else/could/you/want/for/lunch?"}
{"text":"Hands down, Med Caf is one of the best places to get lunch on State Street. The shwarma plate is delicious and filling. Be prepared to wait for a table, but Faisal and the crew keep things moving along. My only wish would be for them to stay open for dinner..."}
{"text":"Love love love Med cafe for a quick lunch. I've only been on Saturdays at around 12, and haven't had problems with long waits for tables inside. I've also only had the shawarma plate, which comes with lamb/beef slices, yogurt sauce, hummus, pita, rice, and a salad (about $7). I think it's the perfect amount/variety of food for a lunch, and it's filling but not super heavy. The people behind the counter are very nice, as previous yelpers have mentioned. I know that this will be added into our regular lunch rotation!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Bring cash and expect a line during the school year (and frequently during the summer too)."}
{"text":"Not quite as much ambiance as Rick's Cafe in Casablanca, but not bad.  Pictures of old Algiers, attentive, but not obsequious wait staff; jovial, francophone owner with genuine interest in pleasing customers; couscous, hummus, naan and falafel that would induce homesickness in any \"pied noir\"."}
{"text":"Two words: cheap, delicious. Easily one of the best lunches in Madison.  The Lamb/Beef shwarma is my favorite, either in a sandwich or added to the top of a greek salad. The tahini can be a bit overwhelming if you're not its biggest fan, but you can always sub it out for the cucumber yogurt instead.  Also delicious is the Avgo soup. The people who work here are super-friendly and food is ready in a flash.  

The place is always really crowded, but the food is worth the wait. If it's a nice day, just get your food to go.  Cash only, so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"Not much to look out from the outside, but inside wonderful fresh food awaits.  Delicious and fresh, I could eat the hummus plate with chicken and salad and warm pita every day.  You order as soon as your get in the door, take your seat, and the friendly staff bring you your meal within minutes.  The place has character, and seems very clean.  Food was an amazing value.  Atmosphere is cozy and homey."}
{"text":"Great cafeteria-style Mediterranian menu. Perfect for students or families on a budget looking for high quality food in an authentic environment that everyone loves."}
{"text":"On of the best lunch spots on State St.  Super quick service - but there is always a line out the door.  Excellent food."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic, and not much of a wait! I tried Azin's Plate, Lamb Shawarma, and Falafel Plate and would be please with ordering any of these next time.

The only drawback is the tiny locale means it can be a bit of a wait, with nowhere to physically wait for a table. However, we walked in while it was full and were seated within 5 minutes.

Friendly service.  Be aware: This place is cash-only, and does not have dinner hours."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place, it's one of my favorite restaurants in Madison.  Really delicious food, super fast, friendly staff, comfortable atmosphere- yes a bit small, but State's St. is a nice place to eat outside, anyways.  But seriously those hours are the worst (They close super early in the afternoon)!  I get that they've always called the shots in that but booo.  That's the only reason they don't get five stars."}
{"text":"This restaurant is probably my best place to go when I want to enjoy a good portion of comfort and tasty food while meeting with friends. It is a really a place where you come in and realize that you know half the people in there. It had this feeling of popular local cafe where local neighbors like to stay, enjoy and... discuss. In any case it really feels like home and I have always been well welcomed there. You should try the Moussaka or the Roti chicken!!!! I highly recommend it!!!!"}
{"text":"Lamb/beef shawarma plate is my favorite meal in madison. It's just so consistently great. Sure it's not fine dining but it's great for the price, quick, nice eating area with good tunes, and close to campus. My only gripe with this place is the tea. I would love to be able to sit down here and have a nice normal cup of tea but this stuff tastes like a sugar bomb exploded in it. No thanks I'll stick with water."}
{"text":"I've been here more times than I can count and love it more than words could say. The owner is a great man, he remembers regular customers so well and is just as gregarious with new ones. Every so often I stray from my usual order, but most of the time I don't need to say anything - he'll ask if I'm getting \"the usual\" (lamb/beef shawarma hummus plate). I've tried many dishes over the years and love them. The pita and hummus are truly the best around (the best I've had since visiting Palestine and Israel). The baklava are both excellent though my favorite is the pistachio. The tea is refreshing and well worth the price. 

Everything there is a great value- exceptional food, a variety of mediterranean cuisines and a staff that are friendly and helpful. What more could you want in a restaurant? In a world where everything is trying for the next big thing and restaurants are creating these massive gleaming palaces, the Mediterranean Cafe (aka Med Caf) stands out as a place where people come together and enjoy the good things in life. Having traveled to various places around the Med Sea, it honestly feels like you're transported to a hidden gem in the Middle East, Algeria, Italy or Spain...it's one of my absolutely favorite places in Madison!"}
{"text":"I realize I'm in the minority here--lots of people I know love this place--but I've just never been very impressed with Med Cafe.  I can't vouch for the meat offerings, but the few vegetarian offerings are bland and unremarkable.  Hummus and falafel here are passable, but nothing to write home about.  If you're looking for good Mediterranean food, I'd recommend Husnu's or the Banzo cart on library mall."}
{"text":"Basically, if you are downtown and want cheap and delicious food check out Med Cafe. They are the absolute BEST Mediterranean food you can find in Madison. Anyone I've brought to Med Cafe have LOVED it. The salad is great. The rice is great. The main dishes are great. The arabic tea is great. I love basically everything about Med Cafe. I worked there for a few months and the owners are all REALLY good to their employees. Everyone is super nice. And I can tell you as someone who worked there that their ingredients are really good. Everything is made from scratch. 

I heard they aren't open for dinner anymore. Which is too bad."}
{"text":"I will keep coming back here again and again. The food, the tea, and the service are all to die for. My only disappointment has been that the falafel is occasionally dry. Also note this place is cash only."}
{"text":"It's hard to beat Med Cafe!  With consistently delicious food, cheap prices and wonderful staff, Med Cafe is one of my favorite restaurants on State St.  If they have the chicken chutney on special, ask for the Akin's Plate with chutney on top.  It's amazing!  Their yogurt sauce and hummus are delicious as well.  While only open  till 4:30pm on most days and closed on Sundays, Med Cafe is worth the trip down St. Street for lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious food, warm friendly staff, fast service, fun ambience and decor--I'll be back for more schwarma! mmmm"}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch here.  Wife had the variety plate and I had the gyro platter.  Very good for the price.  Great little place with vegan selections and food that is a welcome change from our usual fair of rural Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Love the Akins plate and it's the only thing I get when I come here. The inside is small and I usually don't like to eat inside the restaurant because the food smell gets on your clothes. Other than that it's quality food and fast service at a great price."}
{"text":"Best hummus in town, hands-down. Might be my favorite hummus ever. It is the creamy kind, so if you like chunky hummus . . . you are looking in the wrong place. 

Other highlights are the awesome, friendly service (the owner works the counter and hires really kind people), the inexpensive prices (regulars know that you can get soup over rice for about $3), and the Avgolemono soup.

Warning: the falafel--which should be stellar at a Mediterranean restaurant--is not Med Cafe's strong suit. It's pretty dry."}
{"text":"Perfection. Simple quick and great food. I always go with the classic shawarma plate and the Algerian tea is amazing. Sure, it's small and intimate but it's a classic state street restaurant that's dedicated to food. And by God are they good at it. Plus it's a great bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Med cafe never ceases to produce good quality food at a nice price.  I'm always really happy after leaving Med cafe.  I usually order the lamb shawarma plate.  It comes with really good rice, a salad, hummus, pita, and lamb, for a very filling meal.  The hummus is absolutely amazing.  It has flavor without being too salty, and has a nice consistency too.  The pita bread is warm and soft.  The rice is more \"al dente\" which I really like, and pairs well with the lamb.  The salad has the perfect amount of dressing for the salad that you get.  Overall I always enjoy the food here.  Their specials are really good.  I'd recommend the salmon (comes with avocado).  The downside is that they only accept cash."}
{"text":"This place is most definitely my favorite restaurant in Madison. The service is very fast, the owner is very sweet and hospitable plus he speaks many languages, and the FOOD IS AMAZING!!!!!!! All their food is absolutely delicious. Plus, it's not expensive. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT"}
{"text":"Thanks again Yelp. This place was a great find.  It's not a big space inside and there's a simple menu to order from.  The food came out lightning quick and it looked and tasted delicious.  The portion was just right and it made for a great quick meal.  Definitely echo the recommendations if you are in the mood for tasty Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"A State Street institution. Great, hearty lunch meals at affordable prices. The spinach cheese pie is a favorite. Cash only so make sure you run to the ATM before. Their falafel sandwiches are also great and their hot tea is amazing. I've been a customer for almost two decades now. Great to see they keep the same quality of food and service throughout the years."}
{"text":"Literally my favorite restaurant. Ever. My go-to combo is the Lamb Shawarma plate with multiple cups of Arabic tea (so minty, sweet and addictive). The falafel sandwich/plate is something special too! Their pita and tahini sauce (served with every plate meal) is a delightful addition to any dish. Med Caf had such a lovely, warm and homey atmosphere. It's just the best. I would eat here every day (and I often do)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. So glad we did.
Husband got the lamb and beef shawarma, I got the chicken shawarma. Both were really good, but what really blew us away was the tea. 
We are tea people- and I could probably drink this tea every day. My dentist would probably be seeing me a lot more though, lol. The tea is minty and quite sweet, but soooooo good. 
Seriously, get the tea."}
{"text":"This food is hands down the best Mediterranean food I've ever had!! This place is small and very cute. Plus the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"This is frankly the best Mediterranean food restaurant in Madison and trust me I've tried them all. Everything from the excellent food, Faysal's unmatched hospitality, and the staff's friendliness just keeps making me come back and back again to this place to satisfy my Mediterranean food cravings!"}
{"text":"Echoing the last review...it's good! it's cheap! My $4.50 Mediterranean Sandwich wasn't perfect, but it was tasty, fresh, and large. 

The small mug for water is a touch annoying, and I always feel like a bull in a china shop trying to get through their tiny space.

Overall, an excellent place for lunch, especially if one likes hummus! Great hummus."}
{"text":"Let's get this out of the way first:  
-Cash Only
-Vinyl plastic table covers
-No outside food/drinks
-A chalkboard menu of items that slowly gets erased as the day wears on
-Line out the door, and you can only get a booth during the lunch-time rush if you have a party of 3 or more (They _will_ ask you to move).

This place clearly does not need you.  But come here once, and you will realize that it's more about you needing Med. Caf', not the other way around.


The food is amazing, and they have something to keep you fed at every-single-price-point:

SSB Combo:
On a diet,  running low on funds, or just killing time 'til a big dinner later?  
The soup, salad and bread combo can be had for less than most things from the S'bucks next door, and will keep your motor running for at least a few more hours.

Plates:
Hungry out of your mind and looking for a lot of savory protein, creamy carbs, and a bit of crisp clean fiber?
The Akin's, Shawarma or Hummus plates all feature their absolutely delicious gyro meat (or optional chicken), creamy rice, and a very appetite-whetting salad.

Apricot Chicken:
But the cr√®me de la cr√®me in my opinion?  Once a week, when the stars align, the delightful Apricot Chicken may be had.  It's a lasagna-looking item that is very creamy, and runs slighty sweet.  For comparison, the apricot flavor it's somewhat reminiscent of a fine mango chutney.  This dish is _only_ available on Thursdays (Tuesdays need not apply!), and unlike most of their other dishes, will sell out damn fast.  From first-hand experience, if you try to go later on a Thursday, you've basically waited a full week to _not_ eat this dish.


Atmosphere:
As the 80's motif is strong with this one (not to mention you will end up bussing your own table), I generally prefer to take my order to-go, and walk across to the next-door Starbucks, grab a coffee there, and sit on the rooftop balcony and enjoy my food/coffee/view there.  A further walk puts you at the memorial library courtyard, which also has ample seating.

In short:  Bring Cash, and don't let looks deceive you, this place is an awesomely delicious alternative to starving!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The best place in Madison next to The Nile on Odana to get Mediterranean food. One thing that I think would be beneficial to this place is remodeling for a larger capacity. It is pretty teeny... Great local place!"}
{"text":"I was shocked to see I had never reviewed this restaurant. It is my favorite restaurant in Madison, hands down. Their food is absolutely consistent. If it is delicious today it will be exactly the same in a year. The servings are generous and very reasonably priced. The service is amazing. The restaurant is spotless, including the bathroom.
The food is cooked to perfection. The chicken is never overcooked. Spices are used carefully, never overpowering. When I leave the restaurant I feel full but never \"stuffed\". The meals are healthy, beautiful to look at and expertly prepared.
The \"no frills\" decor suits me fine.
I hope the owner has a succession plan. I rue the day he decides to retire. I also fear he will be pushed out as State St is gentrified. To me that would be an arrow in my heart. Eat there now. Who knows what the future will bring."}
{"text":"I LOVE stopping here for lunch.  I would recommend the Shawarma plate and a cup of their tea.  The food is consistently excellent, the portions are generous and the people are nice.  The inside is quaint and homey, the staff are delightful to be around.  Also, if you're looking for authentic baklava, look no further. It is delicious!  They do not take cards, so make sure you grab out some cash!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Madison this weekend for the first time. We were shopping on State Street and he asked the girl working at Pop Deluxe if she had any lunch recommendations. (Side note: Pop Deluxe was a really fun store.) She told us about Mediterranean Cafe and I am so glad we decided to take her advice and check it out! We both got the falafel plate which came with hummus, pitas, rice and salad. It was all delicious! Next time I'm in Madison I know I will go back. It was very affordable and fast! Despite the long line when we arrived, we ordered and had our food in under 5 minutes. It was under $10 each and neither of us could finish all the food they gave us. I think it definitely deserves a 5 star review."}
{"text":"large quantity and fair price. They don't accept card, but the boss is so nice that let me eat first. I ordered lamb sakamra plate, tastes good, and the pancake is great! $9.90 in total."}
{"text":"I never rate any place 5 stars, this place gets 5 stars.  The food arrives very quickly!  Reasonably priced.  Cash or check only.  Most of all delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"I tend to avoid eating at State St. establishments, but \"Med Cafe,\" as my friends affectionately call it, is the first State St. establishment that has made me really regret this. Let this be some valuable and vague lesson in life on never giving up. 

Prices are reasonable, plates are nicely portioned, food is fast, and everything is really good, like catered food good. If I'm ever a few blocks from State St. and it's feeding time, you can be sure I'm there. I don't like carrying cash, but I'll start doing it now. Med Cafe, you've changed me. *shakes fist*"}
{"text":"Really good rice and falafel, Cash only. The falafel isn't too dry. I wish they used more yogurt sauce... but all in all a good meal. Hummus was nice too!"}
{"text":"There is a line outside the door every day at lunch time. When I walk in, I hear so much Arabic flying back and forth that I think I crept in to a back-alley shawerma stand in Aleppo. Take these things as you will. 

I've brought a few people here who were very unimpressed, but that's just because they've spent significant portions of their lives in the Middle East. My obviously-homesick Arabic teachers love this place. You, on the other hand, are probably a white yuppie who can't tell the difference between koshary and mansaf. While the taste is not truly reminiscent of the Arab world, it is about as close as you're going to get in Madison.

In my honest opinion, the falafel is shit, and the chicken shawerma is nothing special. My 4 stars are for the lamb/beef shawerma, which is excellent. Get the lamb/beef shawerma, and only the lamb/beef shawerma.

Portions are also uncharacteristically small for this kind of cuisine. Expect to spend a decent sum in order to get full.

Also, I'd eat here a hell of a lot more often if they actually accepted plastic."}
{"text":"Med Cafe is my favorite lunch spot in town, by far. I usually order the chicken shawarma plate with harissa (hot sauce). The portions are generous, the prices are reasonable, service is quick (my food beats me to the table sometimes), and the staff is pleasant, welcoming, and attentive."}
{"text":"Mediterranean Cafe, a.k.a. Med Cafe, a.k.a. MedCaf, is easily one of the best take-away places in the State Street/Campus area. Lamb and beef shawarma for the win! (Hold the pickles!) And easy on the wallet, too. Just make sure you get there early, because they like to close approximately exactly before you arrive, causing massive shawarma withdrawal symptoms."}
{"text":"Been going to Med cafe for years. A must visit for me every time I'm in Madison. Their Algerian tea is sweet and super tasty."}
{"text":"delicious, cheap eats - they move quickly, their food is good, and i ate here nearly daily for a summer.

i'm a creature of habit - always the lamb and beef schwarma in a pita, no tehini (i'm not a condiment person).  only one other place in madison with decent schwarma, although theirs is a little different, is king of falafel.  either are solid choices!"}
{"text":"I'll swear by their med sandwich. Such a great lunch. Love to stop in, grab it to-go, and sit out at the terrace."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite lunch place in all of Madison.  It is great food and cheap.  I ate here all the time during college, but now can't have it as often because they are only open for lunch (and not at all on Sunday) Now, when I have the opportunity to eat here when they are open, I'll go quite a bit out of the way just to have their Shwarma plate.  They are cash only."}
{"text":"There are no peers to the Med Cafe in Madison, so I include Chicago joins in my comparison.

Breaking down each piece of the plate -The lamb/beef shawarma and pita are both good, but not as good as Pita Inn in Chicagoland. And yet....the total plate I believe surpasses Pita Inn - in large part due to the quality of the hummus which I smother on everything to give it that zest which puts it over the top.

Whenever downtown around lunch time - I'll stop by for a most satisfying meal. If only I could stop by for dinner I would be eating here a lot more..."}
{"text":"This place is simply awesome.  I work on campus - this is the only restaurant on State Street that will actually get me to a cash machine first (no credit cards).  I think it's moronic and arrogant NOT to take credit cards as a business in 2012, unless you have something unique.  This place does.  Authentic, delicious, the falafel and hummus are fantastic.  Worth standing in line, outside, on a cold January day - Enough said."}
{"text":"In the positive-Cute place in State Street  near the union, very friendly awesome counter staff, incredibly quick (our food was waiting for us as we were seated), & cool clients around us.
On the negative side-the hummus was lemony but runny, lamb meant gyro meat, yellow rice was over cooked, olives tasted of menthol (interesting but weird), the chicken seemed like it was steamed or boiled & yogurt sauce added to my schwarma plate.  Funky Madison atmosphere couldn't make up for the mediocre food."}
{"text":"Best. Effing. Tea. Ever. 

This place has the best fresh food and is so quick--perfect for grabbing lunch on the go!! Vegetarians can get a veggie Akin's plate for only $4 and be completely satisfied! And make sure to always get a cup of tea! Delicious."}
{"text":"So delicious! Convinced my family to get off the highway and into Madison for lunch. Lots of vegetarian/vegan options. Definitely get the mint tea! Friendly staff too.

Didn't know what to expect, but rivals some of my favorite med places in Chicago!"}
{"text":"There are a few food categories that, being from LA, we maintained the snobbery of \"there's no way that ______ is better in Madison.\"  Mediterranean is not one of those things.  It's up to par.

The Mediterranean Cafe is the very best affordable food on State Street.  Hands down.

The house-made hummus is absolutely wonderful, and the chicken shawarma plate will keep you coming back for more.  For under 10 bucks (bring cash!) this place will blow you away.  It's decorated well, has ample seating, and the food is just killer.

Give these people your money.  They will give you their food.  It's a win-win."}
{"text":"Food was good & nice staff. Don't really feel it was worthy of all the exuberance that has been expressed by others but I'm vegetarian so maybe they excel more with meat plates. The falafel was average, not enough flavor & definitely could have used more yogurt sauce. Hummus was good, smooth creamy. The greek salad was average- they asked if I wanted everything on it? it was just greens, tomatoes & cucumbers with feta & dressing! No olives? no peppers? The real star was the vegan lentil soup which my son wolfed down- great flavor in a simple soup. Beverage options very limited- ice tea in coffee styrofoam cup? Affordable- bring cash."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in town. Love the collection of lamps in the ceiling. The lack of seating makes you have this huge adrenaline rush to wonder \" will I be able to sit down or say my order super, super slow in hopes someone will stand up while I am still being served?  Exciting I tell you !
The food is so cheap it is amazing the mint tea is incredible strong and has so much sugar bring your insulin ( this is a traditional preparation real sugar no corn syrup/fake sweetners) all hand made food fresh..
Apricot chicken is usually on the specials now I am a vegetarian but I tell you I still would want to order it ..that is how good it is! They have plenty of vegi dishes..The salad is huge they serve on the side not an icebergy lettuce leaf to be found this is food like you make for yourself when you treat yourself right. Go there today! They close at 4 on Sat!"}
{"text":"solid, quick, and cheap. long lines during lunch."}
{"text":"Best falafel in a 200 mile radius. I've had pretty much everything on their menu and it's all wonderful. As a lover on Lebenease food I highly recommend Mediterranean Caf√©. It's small restaurant and often busy but the staff is quick, efficient and always so so gracious and friendly.  They will even take the time to explain their menu selection Mediterranean food newbies.  The only downside is their hours. They really aren't open for dinner unless you like to eat before 4 o'clock."}
{"text":"Amazing and amazing! Afternoon kayaking made us hungry, so we walked down State Street to find some food. We saw Mediterranean Cafe and walked in. 

The manager/owner kindly reminded us that his restaurant closes at 3:30, but he could prepare food for us and we could take it to go. He explained the menu since we told him we had not eaten there before. The manager/owner along with all the staff people were very friendly and cordial with us. 

We ordered the akin's plate, falafel plate and two different slices of baklava for dessert. Long story short: this experience happened a month ago, and we're still raving about how incredible the food was!

The parsley made the akin's plate taste fresh and earthy, the rice on both plates was fluffy and buttery, the falafels were fried perfectly, and the hummus was spiced just right. And the baklava. THE BAKLAVA! The baklava was crispy and flaky and buttery and sweet and salty. It was everything that baklava is supposed to be.

I could go on and on! Or I could just go back to Mediterranean Cafe and enjoy this experience all over again. I think I'll do that. :-)"}
{"text":"I'm not from Madison, so I decided to eat at Mediterranean Cafe after reading some of the reviews. I ordered the lamb shawarma plate which comes with lamb, rice, salad, hummus and warm sliced pita bread. For my drink, I ordered the Arabic tea which I thought was good, but a little too sugary for my taste. My meal was a little over $8, so it was cheap and pretty good. The employees were pretty nice too.

I thought they could have given additional pita bread with the meal (came with 5 or 6 small pieces). The tea was good but way too sweet for me. They don't accept credit cards (cash or check only) and the place was pretty small, so be aware if you have a larger group. A group of 4 or less would work for this cafe. 

Overall, I liked this place. This would be a good place to eat for a quick lunch when you don't want the normal fast food joints around the area."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best. Falafel was dry, cold, and tasteless, like it was fried the previous day and just sat refrigerated over night. I've tried this place twice before writing a review, as I thought that since it had so many positive reviews by others that I must have had a bad experience. However, after going back today I felt that I had to write this review. Maybe they do some dishes well, but the falafel was not fresh at all."}
{"text":"Probably the best Mediterranean food in Madison. Really enjoyed the shawarma sandwich. Lamb was tender and didn't smell funny. The veggies were fresh and the pita bread was good as well. We also had the special couscous which was above average, though not exceptional. 

Service was friendly and the place is crawling with students and locals so seating is tight, but overall a good experience. Oh, and the prices were fair, always a plus."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch last week (our first time) and overall had a good experience.  I had the Akin's Plate with lamb (smaller version of the larger plate) and my husband had the Roti Chicken - peel off the bone.  The rice and the white/yogurt sauce were good, but I just wish they had a spicy sauce - like many of the other Mediterranean places do.  Of course - maybe they did, but I wasn't offered it.  I think both our dishes were screaming for something spicy...or was that me?

Small place - seats maybe 25 people, but we had no problems getting a table on a Saturday during lunch.

Food is good and if I lived in the area, I would go back.  If I was a tourist and only had a few meals to eat in Madison, I would eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I found this little jewel of a restaurant through recommendation. The place was exquisite. I am currently trying to eat healthier, and this was a perfect place for a conscious eater to have a healthy lunch out. The staff were friendly and recommended the Shawarma and falafel plates. We tried both the lamb and beef, and the chicken shawarma plates. I really liked how citrusy the salad and hummus were. It was one of the BEST hummus I've had. I would recommend lamb and beef over chicken for flavor, and chicken over L&B for lean meat/low sodium/calorie. Overall, the plates were well-balanced and fresh. I had to have a pistachio baklava, which we picked up on the way out ($1.30 each). I highly recommend this little desert if you are going to indulge."}
{"text":"Very cheap and open later than most ethic restaurants on State Street (unless you count Qdoba as ethinc!)  Get a good meal with sizeable portions for $5-6.  Can be a little crowded....ok...a LOT...and the tables are a little small....but hey you can eat here for the same price as McDonalds, so who is complaining?"}
{"text":"Everything you try on the menu is guaranteed to be flavorful, warm, and satisfying (and under $7).  The specials change daily and are always unique.  It gets crazy at lunchtime, with both a bunch of staff members ready to help you and a line out the door, but it is certainly worth it.  

Only complaint: not open for dinner or Sundays so that I can eat it more often."}
{"text":"Stop by this place if you're looking for inexpensive and authentic Mediterranean food in the middle of the shopping street. My boyfriend and I were super hungry by the time we found this place. It was like heaven-sent. We share a generous portion of chicken sharwama (I swear that I did not eat more than he did  ;). The meal was flavorful and worth every penny. 
The restaurant is quite small and busy, so it might be a turn down if you are looking for a peaceful meal or a place for big groups."}
{"text":"Med cafe is the best! The restaurant is so cute and cozy, has a worldly, eclectic atmosphere. Always affordable, but cash only. All of the food is delicious and you can't miss out on the tea. This is a great place to meet a friend for lunch."}
{"text":"As I came in, I had a huge craving for falafel and thats all I really knew about meditterean cuisine. The cashier suggested I get the sample plate with falafel because I seemed pretty confused about the menu, which was very nice of her. Everything tasted super fresh and flavorful and I super happy with my meal!! The hummus is so good, and they gave me a free cup of arabic tea(like sweet minty earl grey almost?)too which is actually SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Cash only, usually only open for lunch, but definitely one of my favorites! It's crowded and  can be slow, but it's all worth it for the food!"}
{"text":"This is not an exaggeration

The Med Caf is my single, all-time favorite restaurant in all the world.

I ate here bi-weekly for four years in college and recently visited Madison again only to find that the Med Caf is better than ever.

The place is still run by a committed, warm staff that acts like a huge family.  They are still serving huge portions of authentic food at a bargain.  They are still located in the cutest, coziest hole-in-the wall building RIGHT on state street.

Here's what you do: 
-bring cash

-if there is a line, ignore it, it will move quickly

-snag a tiny table and commence the fascinating people-watching (or get it to go and take it to library mall)

-order a tea.  It's SUPER dark and sweetened.  It will heat you from the inside and transport you to a far-off country.  Instant feeling of comfort ensues

-check out the daily specials, they rotate each day of the week.  

-if you see CHICKEN APRICOT pie on the menu (Thursday's special), order me a plate!  This is perhaps the best food I've ever tasted.  I plan my weeks around it 

-if no daily specials appeal to you, order a hummus plate with chicken. The chicken is tender and juicy without weird chunks of cartilage or bone. It's topped with a creamy mystery heaven sauce. It comes with a salad so you feel you're are doing your body a favor.

-try to save a tiny bit of room for dessert. All you need is one small piece of baklava. Flaky and not overly sweet. The perfect end to the best meal of your life


Seriously, this place is life-changing. I owe a great deal of my college loans to this place but I have no regrets!"}
{"text":"Med Cafe gets 5 stars for its location, prices and portions. This place is excellent for its Shawarma Plates and is a rich-flavored place to eat for lunch.

The downsides are the hours (no dinner) and it's cash only. :(

Regardless, highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I'd say in general this place probably deserves a higher star rating, but the two stars is at my wild disappointment in their chicken shawarma. If you're looking for actual shawarma, do NOT go here. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate, and what they give you is more akin to dry, flavorless lemon chicken breast. Truly a disgrace to call this shawarma. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Faster than most 'fast food', but you're paying for good stuff. I like most things on the menu; the only definite-avoid is the falafel. They're usually stale and cold. But the spinach pies, Mediterranean sandwiches, and shawarma make for top notch lunch options. Prices perhaps a thumb notch over what cost should be--for a full meal you'll spend $8--but you'll probably eat with no regrets."}
{"text":"Solid campus Mediterranean place. Good prices, quick service, large portions. Never had a bad dish here, eaten at least a hundred times. this is a 4.5 stars, but not 5, as it is not out of this world food.

Updates:
Super friendly staff, great decor. I have been eating here often recently. 

The peach/chicken dish is very sweet, to sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"This was easy: 4/5 for food and 6/5 for service for an average of 5.

I ordered two falafel sandwiches. After remembering that it was a cash-only business, I looked in the wallet and said \"Make that _one_.\"

A man who may have been the owner said \"Give him two. It's on me.\""}
{"text":"I wanted Greek food for lunch and found this place on Yelp since it's only about half a mile away from the Capitol square down State St. I ordered a shawarma sandwich, which actually ended up looking quite different from shawarma I've had elsewhere. It looked more like a long, skinny wrap than meat in a round pita, but the flavors were all quite good. Nothing bad, but nothing really outstanding either. The ambience of the restaurant was nice with postcards decorating the walls, and I probably didn't get to experience the fullness of the restaurant since I ordered takeout. I did appreciate that my food came out to only $6 plus tax, which I feel like is a great deal. I can't Greek food in my hometown, so I was excited for this. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Mediterranean Caf√© is a great place to go for a great lunch at a good price.  The chicken shawarma plate is a nice combination of tender chicken, hummus, pita bread, and a salad with nice greens and feta cheese.  In addition to being great food, it's fast!  

To accompany the meal, I always get the hot, Algerian tea.  It is a sweetened, mint tea that is beyond description.  It makes me want to visit Algeria just for the tea!

The owner of Mediterranean Caf√© is from Algeria, so the food is authentic.  The decor and music add to the whole Mediterranean experience.  

If you are looking for a good lunch that is out of the ordinary and won't break the bank, Mediterranean Caf√© is the place to go."}
{"text":"Everything there is delicious from the salad, to the moussaka. Tea is the best! Thanks Faycel for the great food!"}
{"text":"Who reads reviews for Med Cafe? Go here and eat their food. Seriously. Go here and eat their food. Now. Take it to the Memorial Union with a book. Or a friend. This is a real restaurant. The food is cheap and delicious. For every time I see someone in a chain restaurant with the same play school aesthetic, I think about how Med Cafe utterly kills it. Their food is so fucking good. If you hang out with someone that would prefer Einstein Bagels over Med Cafe, stop hanging out with that person. That person cheats in Monopoly. That person takes your beer without asking. That person would attempt to steal your girlfriend but can't because ladies aren't property. That person will take you to Olive Garden for your birthday. And that person will also be late and regift you a shitty used present.

And it'll be your fault because you knew that person didn't like Med Cafe."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best casual cafes in the downtown area.
FYI: It's cash only, so head to an ATM on state if you usually use your card.
I've been living in Madison for the past 4 years and can't believe why I waited this long to eat at this place today for the first time.  The food is absolutely fantastic, and the prices are great too.  I am stuffed after spending less than $10.  I've also never been a big fan of hummus before going here.  The pita bread+hummus is so dang good.  If you've never tried Mediterranean food, try it out here.  The staff is also helpful if you're confused about the kind of food that is served.  I can't wait to start going here on a regular basis. So good!"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast and great food - winning combo as far as I'm concerned at lunchtime. Falafel and schwarma are delicious."}
{"text":"I'm all for the ambiance - the cozy setting, the uniquely decorated walls, and the wornness of the furniture.  Expect a wait for a table during lunch rush hour, since there aren't more than 10 tables within the 4 walls of this place.  Turnaround seems to be pretty quick and efficient though.  Also, don't forget your George's and Abe's bc this joint is cash only.

I had high hopes for my chicken hummus plate, but I was let down.  The salad was really acidic, the chicken shawarma tasted like it had been sitting in a lukewarm water bath all day, and the hummus was just meh.  Pita Inn blows this place out of the water."}
{"text":"I was thinking this would be more of a 3.5 place, but I'm going to round up to 4 because I think I was just overwhelmed when I was there.  The line was moving very quick, and I seemed to stumble over my order.  I ended up getting a lamb plate.  The food was good, but the hummus and pita are what really shone.  Will definitely stop back."}
{"text":"I LOVE MED CAFE!!! This was a staple lunch spot for me during my college years.  I always went with the staple Schwarma plate with the lame and beef (the chicken is also delicious). The hummus is spectacular. In addition, they have daily specials and soup!

THINGS TO EXPECT:
a long line during lunch
cash only
weird hours (closes at 4 and closed sundays)
crowded if you in in the restaurant
more food when you order to-go (just my hypothesis)

It looks random from the outside, but it is a madison hot spot!! On a nice day, bring it to the terrace and enjoy some beer and the lake :)"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in Madison and Milwaukee that we've had so far.  Cozy space, friendly servers and best flavored Shawarma period.  Must try if you are on state street!"}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food I've had in Madison! Very reasonable prices and you get a lot of food. It's very fast service as well. I recommend trying their traditional tea. On the sweeter side but SO addictive. Just wish this place was open for longer hours. Don't forget that they only accept cash"}
{"text":"Very very good food here. Wait time isnt bad.  You get alot of food too prices might be very slightly above average but the quality of food makes up for it. A favorite for downtown if looking for a different type of food"}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma. 'nough said. The hummus is divine as well. My friend always orders extra pita bread. Just a consideration for those who like a lot to dip with. The staff is also fun and consists of quite a few college students.

Get beyond the fact that you have to use cash, and you're unlikely to find a seat in the place, and you're golden!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast and friendly service.  I'll sing the praises of the Shawarma, as others have before me.  Its great on a plate or in a sandwich.  They've got good (albeit sweet) Arabic Tea, and the bean soup is a killer deal for the amount of heartiness it delivers.  Med Cafe - Hooray!"}
{"text":"Simply the best. I go here for lunch at least twice a week, and even on Saturdays if I'm on State St.  I'd eat here every day if I could! My teenagers love this place! When my parents (in their 80s) are visiting from Fla. (Boca even) they won't miss their Med Cafe fix! Once you become a regular (and it WILL happen), you are family. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'll need to go back to try this out again because I wasn't impressed! I got the chicken shawarma and it was fresh, perfectly filling and healthy. But the flavors seemed sub-par to me; the chicken was boring and the hummus wasn't thick enough. I'm also thrown off by their hours- If you want to go between classes, there's a huge rush! Anyway, my friends' lamb was much juicier and spicier, so I definitely would get that next time. I hear the tea is good, too... So I'll report back later!"}
{"text":"Nice place to go for lunch. It's always pretty crowded since it's a small place, especially on weekdays, though, so I recommend going before the lunch rush. The workers are friendly, and the food is yummy. I like the chicken shawarma plate -- it has chicken, salad, hummus, seasoned rice -- the portion size is just right and the flavors go really well together. I like that it comes with a side of pita, too. It really hits the spot when you're craving a nice, light lunch."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in madison.  My next favorites are Banzo and Bunky's."}
{"text":"This place is spectacular.  The owner is as caring and thoughtful with his dishes as with his clientele.  I'm ever impressed at the healthy and tasty choices at such great prices.  It's not to be missed."}
{"text":"The Mediterranean Cafe may be one of the most memorable places I've been to. The food, first of all, is great, I don't think I've ever had a bad meal. There are plenty of regular everyday things you can get like Shawarma and falafel, but there are also daily dishes that rotate, and they are excellent.  One that I always remember is the Chicken Apricot Pie (does it sound odd? Actually it's more like a pot pie than a fruit pie, but, well, sweetened). Anyway, good creative food, at a very reasonable price (rarely over 7$), and also the service is very fast. There are some technicalities that make it harder to eat here (it's busy at lunch, and it closes around 4 in the afternoon nowadays... way too early!), but overall, this is one of the best places in Madison."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food. Their cuisine always tastes of the sun-kissed shores, where olive trees dot the rugged hills and goats wander around nibbling on grass. I've tried most of the Mediterranean/Greek/Levantine/Turkish places in Madison, and I find this place the best. I think it's because their grilled meats are more well-flavored than elsewhere, the service is fast and inexpensive, and they have many of my favorites, including moussaka and baklava. Also the hummus is particularly good. I like my hummus a bit more garlic and chunk, and that's how this restaurant does it. But more than their generally delicious food is that they have an incredibly fragrant sweet mint tea that I believe is a specialty of Algeria, where I think the owner is from. It's not quite traditional Moroccan mint tea, because this tea is made from black instead of green tea, but the fragrance and sweetness is just as wonderful. On a cold day, when I'm feeling lonely and want a comfortable space to be, I come here for lunch and sip a warm cup of their tea."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. Every dish is great, and many cannot be had elsewhere around Madison. Lines are long, but move quickly. I recommend the heartier dishes like moussaka, kibbe, chicken apricot pie and spinach pie."}
{"text":"The food is decent, but for the price it is excellent quality.  The staff are fun and friendly, service is exceptional.  It's got that \"Madison feel\" to it - trendy but not pretentious, down-to-earth but not dirty.  It's very crowded and small but still worth it.  Always recommended."}
{"text":"Best hummus in town.  The prices are very reasonable and it just plain feels good in the dining room.  Its not fancy (you bus your own table) but the food is excellent.  I've seen it get crazy on game days but the numerous employees do a great job.  The workers are UW students I assume and they're friendly and considerate.  I'm always happy I went."}
{"text":"Best quick cheap food in town.  Wish they were open more but hey that's part of their pull"}
{"text":"Mediterranean Caf√© offers inexpensive lunch that tastes just like authentic Mediterranean food. Can't go wrong with the falafel or the Akins plate. It's usually a lot of food for a decent price but trust me you'll finish your plate. 

Wish it was opened for more than just lunch. It's really crowded around noon but the food comes crazy quick after you sit down and is always warm. Also the aesthetic of the restaurant makes you forget you're in Madison, which is hard to find around here."}
{"text":"Great food and the people are always nice.  Roti Chicken with couscous for the lunch specials whenever I could, when I was in college there.  I grew up in Saudi Arabia, so this kinda stuff is comfort food for me."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to eat lunch in Madison, GO HERE. 

The food is fresh, delicious, and cheap--what more could you ask for?? 
The staff is always friendly too. 
I could eat lunch here almost every day and not get tired of it. The hummus is smooth and creamy, the salad is fresh and dressed just right, and the meats are always really flavorfull. 

The only complain I have is that they aren't open for dinner!"}
{"text":"Food: 4
Decor: 2
Service: 2

3.5 stars, rounding down because they forgot my water. Come here if you want fast, cheap, and decent Mediterranean food.

1. Chicken shawarma, 7 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oezMXnkdUQMuMH7RuKaiyw?userid=2fN8mN7uUjOw-QqtcgYqXQ
Not bad. Food came out almost as soon as I got a seat, and it was all decent.

If I went to school around here, I'd probably come here pretty often. FYI, they're CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"the lamb akins plate is tastyyyyyyyyyy.  fast service too"}
{"text":"OK, but Pricey.

They made good and cheap menu less visible.

Menu with large photos are expensive or meat menu.

Basically, I ordered something I did not want twice since I thought these are all available."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is cooked to perfection and an excellent value. The owner is incredibly kind and thoughtful. This is truly a gem for Madison. I wish they delivered, as I have moved away and often crave my precious Med. Cafe, as does my best friend who has also moved away. This is the real deal!!"}
{"text":"Mediterranean Cafe is delicious, and it is cheap to boot!  The only downers are that they only take cash and there is always a line out the door for lunch.  However, if you want to be seated the line does move fairly quickly and they will start on your food before you're seated."}
{"text":"I always come here for the hummus and lamb&beef shawarma with rice, and the algerian tea. The hummus is really smooth, creamy and flavorful, best eaten with a side of pita bread! The shawarma is always cooked perfectly, and seasoned really well with their mix of spices. But the star of place, in my opinion, is the tea. It's minty, sweet and piping hot, perfect when you want to walk down state street in the middle of Wisconsin Winter (ie way below freezing).

Always friendly service, but beware, it's cash and check only. Pro-tip: UWCU ATM right across the street."}
{"text":"I was so excited by all the hype for this place. I ordered a chicken Schwarma sandwich and sprinted home to eat it. It was...good. And that was it. Just good. Not mind blowing. The yogurt sauce was really good. The chicken was dry. There wasn't a lot of filling. Maybe the plate is better, but I was bummed."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. I'm very picky about Mediterranean food as I spend 4 years in the middle east. This food, does it justice, hands down. It was my first visit to Madison and my significant other picked out this place on our way through. The place itself is small, but intimate. Youll have to order your food in line and then they find you a seat. I had the Chicken Schwarma plate. The yogurt sauce over the chicken is nicely spiced with a lemony zest; there is a mint chutney like mix that goes well with the rice and the hummus. Finally the chicken is very tender and easily breaks with a fork. All this together with a toasted pita and salad was perfect. Other meats include lamb and beef, all which were great. Overall quick service, reasonable prices less than 10$ and very friendly staff. The place is comfortable and they have a nice design with cultural blankets, signs and pictures."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. All of my future Mediterranean dining experiences will be compared to this one. The food is served fresh, fast, warm and by a friendly staff. I recommend the hummus plate. It was the perfect amount of food and the flavors blended perfectly together. Bring cash and enjoy."}
{"text":"Mediterranean Cafe is one of the few places on State Street that has a clue about what they're doing.  These people work hard and run a very efficient, friendly, and affordable operation-- you get a very good meal very fast and that is rare around here.  Please, please, please open for dinner!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and fairly cheap, but they only take cash and if you go at lunch be prepared to wait in a line. The line moves fairly quickly and the food slingers are pretty adept at putting together your food in a hurry. It was less than five minutes after we placed a to-go order and our food was in a bag and in our hands. The Akins lamb plate is a little skimpy on the meat and heavy on the rice, and I would have liked more salad. Chicken shawarma is a solid choice, again with the hummus, rice and salad."}
{"text":"It's Good! It's cheap! What more could you ask for?...well, maybe some more seating and them staying open for dinner.
But I love this place and have never had a bad meal there. Ever! 
Do the Akin's Plate, the yogurt sauce is awesome. Homemade soups for $1.50! Great employee's too! You can eat like a king for about $8.50!"}
{"text":"Skip the gyro and give this place a try. A little high priced but still under ten bucks for a great lunch."}
{"text":"This seems like a very well-meaning restaurant and the staff was very kind, but I am absolutely mystified by the rave reviews of the food. The shawarma was incredibly bland and did not taste the least bit authentic, and the falafel tasted stale, like it had been frozen and re-heated. The very fact that the food is ready less than two minutes from the time it is ordered should concern anyone looking for quality and freshness. To me, it seemed very much like a fast food version of authentic Mediterranean food. 

Having moved from a city with an incredible selection of exceptional Mediterranean restaurants, I felt incredibly disappointed by my experience and utterly misled by all of the 5-star reviews. This restaurant does not even come close."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing chicken shwarma.  The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because they have pretty inconvenient hours, - not open for dinner, last I was there it was cash only, although the machine may have been down.  Also, I don't eat dairy, and all meat is marinated in yogurt.  But it's damn worth the afternoon of illness."}
{"text":"Delicious Mediterranean food.  I really like the lamb shawarma and chicken.  The price is not bad for how much food you get.  The only things I don't like about the place is the limited amount of seating and that they don't accept credit cards."}
{"text":"After reading the positive reviews, I put this first on our list for lunch on a recent trip to Madison. The food and atmosphere were excellent! No doubt seeing a look of hesitation on our faces as we read over the menu and specials posted above the counter immediately to the right as you enter, we were welcomed and shown a shawarma plate. I ordered the falafel sandwich special with a cup of Algerian tea and my husband ordered the lamb shawarma plate. The seating is tight and tables are on the small side so be prepared/forewarned. Very soon after seating ourselves our food was delivered to our table. My husband's order came as the falafel plate, but they quickly swapped it out for the lamb/beef. It was a cold, rainy spring afternoon but it was warm and cozy inside and the tea was wonderfully hot in temperature. The tea is very sweet, in case that isn't your preference. We noticed a couple of groups bussed their own tables.  Based on the abundant number of employees there, we did leave our dishes on the table. The bathrooms were clean. The overall atmosphere transported us to a different country...loved traveling if only through the food and hospitality. Will definitely return to and recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I tried Mediterranean Cafe out based on the Yelp reviews and I have to say I wasn't tat impressed. It was average tasting food. I personally feel like they are a bit skimpy on the portion sizes.

I have only tried the Chicken Shawarma the two times I've dined there. It's not bad but not the best thing I have in the world.

I think the restaurant is too small as well as their menu."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and we enjoy the flavorful food and cheap prices.  Some of the dishes that we order on a regular basis includes the falafel wrap, which has a thin, tasty sauce and the falafels have a little bit of a crunch.  We also always order the avgol. soup, which is a little lemony with tasty pieces of rice and chicken.  We've also tried the shawarma plate, apricot chicken, moussaka, and mediterranean sandwhich, which were specials--all of which were also delicious and flavorful.  We've brought our young son and the staff was very nice and accomodating, despite the fact that we always bring him during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"By far the best falafel and shawarma in town. Damn cheap too. Cozy little setting with lots of pictures from middle eastern countries. 

Only flipside is that it's really crowded during the lunch hour and there aren't as many tables as this place has fans (i mean the human variety...not the mechanical ones!)

But boy, if I worked in the downtown area (which, unfortunately, I don't), I'd eat here every single day!!! No kidding!

Btw, try their pistachio baklava....worth the calories."}
{"text":"Really awesome food. The chicken mustard was a treat. And very nice and super fast service!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great plate of food in Madison for under $10, you just aren't going to do any better than Mediterranean Cafe. I believe it's run by a father/son from Algeria, so it's more Middle-Eastern-focused, but none of the food is really that foreign/adventurous, just solid, typical Arabic-style mediterranean food. It's unassuming from the outside (and pretty cramped on the inside), but the food is always superb.

I typically get the lamb shawarma plate, which comes with lamb, hummus, mixed greens salad and pita bread. The hummus is awesome, and the creaminess is really great in contrast with the vinegar-based salad dressing, which is great as well. The lamb and pita bread are pretty standard, but definitely solid. In my opinion, though, the real star of MedCaf is the deliciously-minty Algerian tea. I'm by no means a tea connoisseur, but trust me: You'll wish you could make it at home. 

As I said, it can get cramped inside, but if you can get a seat, there's very little wait time. It's a great ethnic interior, with flags adorning the walls. The staff always thanks you when you leave, which, though it doesn't seem like a big deal, is really a nice touch. I do wish it was open more often, but it kind of adds to the exclusivity of the place. A really great eating experience overall, and like I said, for under $10, with an entree and the amazing tea.

One last thing: This is a cash-only place, so don't be a n00b and come in without any dough."}
{"text":"To start this review off, I would like to say that I LOVE Mediterranean food. When I moved to Madison and saw that there was an extremely highly rated and cheap mediterranean place near me, I was ecstatic. I finally got the opportunity to try this place this afternoon and I unfortunately was not that impressed.

Don't get me wrong - this place was pretty delicious. My friends who came with me also really enjoyed their meals. I got the Lamb + Beef Shawarma plate, which came with your typical rice + tabouli salad + hummus + pita. For $10, it's a decent amount of food - I think this place is an excellent lunch choice (Given that it's not open for dinner, the store owners think that, too). 

I DO think this place is slightly overhyped though. I have certainly had better Mediterranean food, even at this price point. I'll definitely be back in the future, but if you've had some really good Mediterranean food from other bigger cities, I wouldn't get your hopes up too high for this place. I'd recommend it for sure though if you're looking for a low-cost Mediterranean lunch!"}
{"text":"I don't get all the hypes!! I only had a falafel wrap, and it wasn't 4 stars. And trust me, I've had the real deal back in CA. I'm not sure if they're getting that much traffic because there's no competition. I don't want to be too judgmental at this point. I'd go back and try another item from the menu (which looked quite extensive), and update my review.

So here comes the update: It's been about 3months since I came here last time. Today, I tried Med cafe lunch for the second time. I ordered Tejime (or something that sounds like that) and a cup of arabic tea. Tejime is a dish with beef meat ball and stewed veggie served over rice. While the stewed veggies were tasty, the beef meatballs were way too salty for my taste. This was first time for me to try this particular dish, so I don't know whether or not that much salt was supposed to be in the recipe. Maybe the overly sweet arabic tea was supposed to neutralize the palette.  Anyway, after the second time around, i still give the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Until I visited the Mediterranean Cafe I thought Hummus was gross and that Mediterranean food was lame.  Boy was I wrong!  I haven't had anything here that I didn't like.  I highly recommend the Lamb plate.   Oh also should mention that it's CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic experience at Mediterranean Cafe today! The owner was working the counter and promptly asked me if I'd been there and gave me a cup of tea for free with my order when I told him just once before. I ordered the falafil sandwich to go and it was absolutely delicious.  Perfect for a summer day when your looking for some fresh comfort food to get you through an afternoon. Simple and quick, without compromising on taste or experience."}
{"text":"The last three times that I have been here the chicken sandwich is mostly bread and no meat/veggie filling. they put sauce in the sandwich and then stand it up for you in the wrapper. The top 75% of the sandwich is mostly dry bread. By the time that you get to the bottom 25% of the sandwich, all of the really runny yogurt sauce has fallen to the bottom and turned the sandwich into absolute mush. Quite disgusting!"}
{"text":"I was in town on business and had a hankering for Mediterranean. The chicken schwarma plate, with Lebanese tea (on ice), was fantastic and legit! I enjoyed speaking briefly about the chicken with the shy and unassuming proprietor, complementing him on the presentation. Lots of regulars here, which speaks well for them."}
{"text":"Med cafe is fast food but don't think for a second they skip out on flavor or the quality is low. My al time favorite dishes are the lamb plate and the roti chicken. Their generous plates are served up with a side of hummus and pita and a side salad, these sides alone are packed with flavor, your tastebuds will be satisfied. If you're looking for a smaller option, they have sandwich options for most of their plate dishes. 

A few things to keep in mind. They are a cash only restaurant, but I often cross the street over to UW Credit Union and use their no-fee atm ;). Another thing is to note is their business hours. They are closed on Sundays and Mondays and are only open til 3:30p so no dinner dates here. The cafe is really small, I often go to pick up food. I only had one dine-in experience so I can't really say."}
{"text":"I have been going to Mediterranean Cafe for a vey long time. Not only is the food delicious and fresh, the people who work there are also friendly and amazing. 

All the food is made fresh daily. They have specials that change daily and if you come in to late, they will be gone. My favorites are the moussaka, cous cous and lentil soup. That being said nothing on the menu is a bad choice. 

It is cash only so keep that in mind. The good thing is there is an uw credit union across the street with a fee free atm."}
{"text":"Great food for cheap, and the platters were put together so quickly I almost couldn't believe it.

I walked in, got in line (actually, I might have accidentally cut in line), and ordered the Chicken Shwarma Plate and the Chicken Akin's Plate. By the time I got to the counter to pay for my order (less than two minutes later), my two takeout boxes were already being carefully placed inside a plastic bag.

The Cafe hours definitely cater more towards UW students than to the working people, as the cafe opens at 10AM and closes at 4PM on most days. The prices definitely benefit the broke college student community as well. $6-8 bucks for a balanced meal? I'm SOLD! Good thing we can allllll cash in the great deal! (:

I had the Chicken Akin's Plate myself, and although it was a simple meal, it was very filling and very satisfying. The chicken was well-seasoned and tender, the hummus was fresh and complimented the chicken and the pita bread well, the salad dressing was superb(!), and even the rice was bursting with flavor. 

I can't wait to be in Madison this summer. I know that this will be one of my staple food groups for the season! :D"}
{"text":"If I was told I could only eat at one State Street restaurant for the rest of my  life, Med Cafe & Himal Chuli would have to battle it to the death... I have no idea how I would ever decide.  The food at Mediterranean Cafe is reasonably priced and always very fresh.  The staff is quite pleasant.  The only downside to Med Cafe, is that it may be best to take your food to go during the lunch rush, as it is quite difficult to score a table and it is usually extremely crowded.  Also you should be aware that in the summer months, they have tended to close earlier. (before 8pm) 
I have been madly in love with the falaffel plate for years. The hummus is awesome. Also try the ever slightly changing usually vegetarian soup with a side of pita bread-- it will cost you around $3 or less.  Don't worry meat eaters; they do usually have some chicken and beef items on the menu."}
{"text":"Haha, good times. My favorite memory was when my to-be-unnamed acquaintance who I was eating with got yelled at by the owner!  This is a positive review since the guy was a jerk anyway.  Bottom line is that this is a real deal local place and the guy that runs it doesn't take any crap.

Note that it has limited hours (basically just weekday lunchtime) and that you must pay in cash.  The motley crew of young student types that work there are sincere and helpful, just trying to get people fed and out the door!"}
{"text":"A true diamond in the rough. As a Madison foodie, I am always swarming the food carts on State Street during my lunch breaks but every once and a while I visit Med Cafe which is esentially like stepping inside a food cart due to it's size. A literal hole in the wall and easy to miss but oh so fab. Everything is authentic and they are quick making most of the entrees right in front of you (or behind the counter) by the friendliest staff on State Street. Seating is limited but do try to dine in if you have the time and space; the little dose of Med culture is worth it."}
{"text":"Prices & portions are perfect..where else can you have Baklavas for $1.35 & .85?
Food was enjoyable, lamb lacked the home seasoning of another spot on State but nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Seems as if I share the sentiment as the majority of the other posters.......cannot find a better meal on State Street in the under $10 price range.  Do yourself a favor by asking for some hot sauce to go along with that lamb/beef or chicken shawarma plate!  You also might as well order a piece of baklava as well......flaky and not as sweet as the typical ones!  

The place is small and there's always a wait for a table during lunch, but turnover is quick.  Bring cash with you as well because Med Cafe doesn't accept plastic!"}
{"text":"It's cafeteria style which kind of threw me off when I first went in, but the waitress was nice enough to explain everything to me. The food is pretty decent with large portions. Good for a quick lunch or take out."}
{"text":"This place has everything going for it. For $9.50 you can get an entire plate of shawarma. I got the lamb and it was amazing. You order right when you walk in the door and pay. Then you need to find yourself a seat in the tiny dining area. They keep the tables really clean and before I was even settled into my chair our food was at the table. The lamb was done to perfection. I loved the dressing on the small salad is cut through the richness of the rice/lamb and hummus. The meal was also served with pita which was great for scooping all the ingredients. My husband had the same plate but with falafel and he really enjoyed it. For the price and quick meal you cannot beat this place in Madison. You simply have to stop in when in town!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch - had a cup of \"chicken lemon rice\" soup - fantastic! And a Akin plate with lamb/beef, rice, tzatziki, veggies and pita.  Perfect lunch and under $10."}
{"text":"Yum! Good food, great prices. Especially good for lunch. Get a sandwich or shawarma plate and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mediterranean restaurant! The Lamb and Beef plate is my go to. The owner and workers are so kind. I used to eat here all the time when I was in college. I came back for a visit 8 years later and this was my first stop. Love it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places on State St! I have zero complaints about the food and the only minor complaint about the space is that it's a little small. Other than that, love the med cafe! 

They only accept cash, so be sure to have that on hand. I order the chicken shawarma on a plate."}
{"text":"Yummy Mediterranean food! My husband and my two year old son went in for lunch on a Saturday. Phenomenal food and friendly staff. I was concerned about finding a table since the place was packed. The host told me that they definitely had room for us. After we ordered our food was brought to a booth right away. We then sat and we're ready to eat. The spinach cheese pie was great and the pistachio baklava was terrific! It can be hard to find a restaurant that kids and parents will like. Our son enjoyed the ambiance just as much as we did. The only downsides to this place are that they cash only and do not serve alcohol. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have liked the service and the staff. I wish I could say the same about the food! Last time I ordered a chicken hummus plate and though it was a pretty generous plate, it was quite one-dimensional in taste.. The salad dressing was too sour and even the hummus tasted like it had too much lemon in it. The chicken lacked in flavor and covered in yet more sourness of the yogurt sauce."}
{"text":"Fairly cheap, authentic mediterranean food. If you're on campus, this is definitely a place to hit up for lunch with a friend. Bring cash!"}
{"text":"This cafe is super cozy and nicely decorated. You'll enjoy delicious dishes when listening to an awesome eastern music. Their music selection is something that you don't want to leave just because of this!
The owner is the most hospitable one I've ever seen in a restaurant in town, and you feel this right after you enter the restaurant.
All in all, this place is going to be my favorite eatery around campus."}
{"text":"Owner is the most disrespectful condescending human being I've ever encountered in a restaurant.  His frozen lamb and beef gyro from kontos foods will never be worth his attitude. Also I've seen him preparing food without gloves after handling money without sanitizing, I wanted to vomit.  Never go here plenty of real quality places in Madison minus the attitude!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! So many good reviews, I just had to try it. My young daughters love falafel, but they did not love Med Cafe's falafel, which was crumbly and flavorless. I had the chicken shawarma, which was dry and bland--I had to steal the girls' tahini sauce just to eat it. The pita was flat, tough, and tasteless as well. The hummus was fair, but it tasted like greek olives and lacked the garbanzo-y good ness of really the good hummus I've enjoyed elsewhere like Nile. The decor was nice, and the atmosphere good--bright colors and tin lamps, with lots of busy, intellegent people surrounding us. To bad you can't eat atmosphere! All in all, I have to ask: did we eat in the same restaurant that received all of these five star ratings?"}
{"text":"mmm DELICOUS, that sums Med Cafe up pretty good!  It's a great summer meal and I love the lamb shwarma plate with hummus and a salad! The service their is great too, I'd take it to go, it gets pretty crowded and warm inside."}
{"text":"By far the best Mediterranean Food in Madtown! Owner is super nice and it is more than affordable."}
{"text":"Med cafe is good every day. Every meal.  EVERYTHING I've eaten here has been spot-on and delicious.  Also awesome for groups who are lookign for a restaurant that offers vegetarian&meat dishes.   They could serve this food in a different restaurant and charge twice as much and people would totally go for it.

Akin's plate: Get your schwarma put over rice , salad, and a bit of pita bread. Nom.

Hummus plate:  Yes, there's freshly made hummus topped with smoked paprika. But you can also get schwarma with your hummus&salad!

Rotating specials: Chicken with apricot sauce is excellent.

Staff is always ready to help customers with a smile, and don't forget to get a piece of baklava on the way out!"}
{"text":"I missed their salmon with mango and salsa sauce, and roti chicken. Their food rocks. The owner and staff are friendly. Affordable price. The cafe is a rock star on campus"}
{"text":"So I am generally a fan of this place and have been coming for years. Today I tried their relatively new dish, Spanish Salmon. And unfortunately it was just not good. Too hard and dry. Avoid this dish. My favorite is chicken swarma platter."}
{"text":"Best. Food. Ever. But only open until 4:30pm! And not Sundays either. 

Regardless, the Akin's plate has to be one of the premiere bang-for-your-buck meals on State Street."}
{"text":"We walked a couple of blocks to get here and had to pay to park but it was well worth it.

I had the Akin plate and my husband had a lamb gyro type plate.  Mine was smaller but it was still very filling.  The taste was wonderful and mine had just enough meat for me.

Like everyone else has mentioned the mint tea was hot and very agreeable on the cold day.  I will try to copy the tea as I live so far away.

Thanks for this wonderful place."}
{"text":"The spinach pie is to die for and it's available Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays!"}
{"text":"Great, fresh food made with care and love.   Chat with the owner sometime.  He treats each $5 plate of lamb beef like he was serving it to his kin."}
{"text":"If you charge 8.50 for a falafel plate, you should put more than 2 falafel balls on the plate. Plus the vegan lentil soup is a joke. I'll bring you my lentil soup one day. And you'll see how an actual vegan lentil soup looks like in the Mediterranean."}
{"text":"Quite honestly the greatest food establishment I've ever been too. I've been going to medcafe once or twice a week, every week, for the past 4 years. I have never ordered anything but the chicken schwarma plate, and I have never been anything but utterly satisfied with the dish and my experience. Now that I've graduated and moved out of Madison I dream of the heavenly hummus, perfect pita, & satisfying schwarma. Today I've been back to visit for the first time in a few months and it is still the greatest dish of all time. Seriously I'd move back to Madison for this dish alone so if anyone is in Madison or the surrounding areas go to Medcafe!! You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"We loved ordering from this place when I was working on campus. They have some weird hours though. $ for the Swarma plate--we just called that dish the Delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious.
Fast.
Cheap.

I guarantee you will leave fat and happy!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! I got the shawarma plate, and my friend had the hummus. She really enjoyed her meal, and the flavors were seriously spot on in my dish. I really really liked their food. It's such a small and non-stuffy type place. I'd definitely come back when I'm in Madison again. 

Just remember that they're cash only! This place is definitely a must try though!"}
