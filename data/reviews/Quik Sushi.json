{"text":"I used to like this place but they've started cutting corners and just ripping customers off. Its close to my work, in the St Lawrence Market so I go fairly often and almost always get a green dragon roll with fried shrimp and grilled eel. I haven't been for a few weeks and when I got back to my office with my usual order I found that they had replaced the shrimp with fried yam. And somehow, the yam was still completely hard and raw on the inside. They pulled off this little scam by making the top roll with a piece of shrimp tail and the rest is all raw yam. So it wasn't a case of me picking up the wrong one, or a change in recipe,  they are actively trying to deceive people into paying a higher price for a cheaper product. I get that rents in the St Lawrence are probably high, but it's a fairly affluent neighbourhood of offices, they could have raised the price rather than scam people and lose customers. The owners are obviously unscrupulous and it sickens me to think about how else they're cutting costs in terms of sanitation and freshness. I'm done with this place. I can walk a block further and get sushi someplace else"}
{"text":"Sadly I did not check the reviews before getting lunch here.  I want my money back.  It was one of the worst lunches I have ever paid for in my life.  $10 for instant noodles and beansprouts. Crooks.  Same as previous review from Robin D."}
{"text":"It is located in st lawrence market.  There is food court lower level of the building.  They are one of them.  They have good collection of pre-made sushi rolls which looked so tasty.  I picked one of them actually it was not cheap but good taste than i expected!!  They have tempura and teriyaki and other japanese and korean menu, too.  I would recommend this place for quick meal when you are in this area!!   There is table inside and outside you can enjoy food anywhere you like.  And also no need to tip so that is another good thing of food court food.  They sell miso soup for $1.00 taste good too!!  Their tempura was pre-made but taste still good!!  But non pre made menu such as beef teriyaki something took longer than I expected. Taste was little meh and portion was small.  Recommend you pre made sushi which is quick and good taste and quality!!"}
{"text":"Located at the basement of  St. Lawrence Market I had passed by this spot numerous times but never indulged here.  I was looking for some sashimi grade tuna and some tobiko for a planned dinner at home. Disappointed with what the Market had to offer I decided to check this place out as it was an hour +  trek all the way up to mid town for my favorite fish monger.  I  was pleasantly surprised. I wanted some tuna sashimi and even though they didn't have a tuna only sashimi combo they obliged and made one for me. In addition they were kind enough to sell me some tobiko for a reasonable price.  Bonus points for letting me try before buying.  The prices are reasonable and are comparable to your corner sushi place. This is by no means the top grade fish but did the work nonetheless for the effect I was trying to achieve. Check out the pics folks (tuna sashimi is their product and so are the tobiko on the creations by moi ) all the guests were very happy and the tobiko was fresh and provided an extra layer of texture and color to my dishes. I would give it 3 stars but their extra effort deserves and extra star. VISA or MC only."}
{"text":"First of all, why aren't the correct pictures of this store posted on here? And second why aren't more people writing about this store? There should be at least 30 reviews on here by now, but there's only two?! That's a shock, given that Quik Sushi does have customers grabbing a quick bite while perusing around inside St. Lawrence Market.  I used to pass by this place whenever I was inside St Lawrence market, but was doubtful about how well the food tasted. But the displays of Tempura finally got me to give this place a try. One section has the sushi display and the other half offers rice and noodle dishes and tempura combos which look so fresh and crispy! I've only ate from the rice and noodles section and the quality of the food here is practical, reasonable, quick-fix and comforting.  The first time I ate from here in mid-2015 their miso ended up being a life saver. I had a big sinus allergy attack that morning and was dripping like a leaky faucet and felt like I was going to get a fever. Still, determined to give this place a try, I had a Bibimbap and an order of Miso Soup. I've been here twice and the each time the miso soup is always piping hot and keeps its hot temperature longer than a cup of coffee. Be very careful when even taking a sip, you will fee the scorching shock from the heat instantly. On the first occasion of consuming it, broth seemingly stopped my sinus run from continuing. Just shortly taking a few glups of the soup, I could feel my nostrils drying up. That was surprising. The bibimbap was also good and filling with a nice dallop of gojujang chili paste in the center of the meat and vegetable arrangement.  The second time I came here was on Thursday and this time I had the spicy, pork teriyaki on a bed of rice with an order of miso soup. The spiciness in the pork teriyaki was due to a good spoonful of chili paste, probably gojujang being added to the meat while it was being cooked. It was also serving steaming hot on a bed of rice and again I had to be very careful when sipping some miso soup because hot liquid burnt my tongue haha.  I'll definitely be returning here and next time I'll try out their sushi and tempura and gyozas."}
{"text":"I was still a bit hungry after my meal at Urbain Bagel Bakery so I decided to get some food here.   I picked up a California Roll that came with a side of wasabi and some of the rolls came with fish eggs on top!   The rolls were not fantastic, but were solid. I especially liked how they add fish eggs on top. It added a nice secondary taste and a nice texture with the rice and crab.   I did not really find the prices here to be too outrageous.  The staff here was really nice and pointed out the California Roll to me. You can also see all the sushi being made by the chefs. I also found it cool how the chefs wore tradition sushi chef style uniforms!    Altogether, this is a nice restaurant to pick up a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Umm.. no!  They serve ramen here with vegetable and 3 gyoza. Its really instant noodles and beansprouts. Think the gyoza taste OK. Careful, its piping hot. Instant noodles for $8!!"}
