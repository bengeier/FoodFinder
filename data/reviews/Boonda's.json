{"text":"Food is excellent. Better wings than anywhere..... They don't compare to quaker steak.  Monday is wing night !!!! Also try the buffalo chicken pizza. It's killer !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Philly Steak specialty pizza. It was ok, in my opinion it was a little pricey for what we received. WAY too many onions on it, not a lot of steak and overall lacked flavor. It wasn't bad, but disappointing."}
{"text":"Terrible. I ordered 2 orders of French fries, and I only got 1 order, if they can't listen to my mouth or anybody's, they should go wash dishes or something, don't be the guy who takes orders"}
{"text":"Great wings! Food is good staff is friendly and delivery is fast! Our fav"}
{"text":"Boonda's continuously misinforms their customers with their menu specials. For example, \"any 1/2 hoagie and a side,\" means \"we want you to call but are excluding chicken, turkey, and shrimp. so in other words, by ANY, we merely mean steak or italian. if that is the case, then please do not so easily throw the term around to con customers into calling your establishment. This has been the third time something like this has occured. and if your coupon says something it shouldn't, then you should honor it until you correct it (as you claimed to correct, but in the most recent pennysaver received in the mail today, same old tricks). my mistake is continuously crawling back after this occuring 4 different time. lesson learned..."}
{"text":"Their pizza is good,  but I agree that their wings are hit or miss.   Their staff is not the friendliest but they deliver on time."}
{"text":"One of the better local pizza places; however, if they were more consistent they could be a 4 star, for West Mifflin, restaurant. We normally order wings and maybe salads from this place. Monday is indeed their wing night, and some times on wacky Wednesday, and they are 58 cents a wing with a minimum of 1 dozen. At that price, it is certainly not the best deal on wings in town, but it is decent and normally works when we don't feel like driving somewhere further. They have plenty of wing flavors to choose from (check out the pictures of the menu), but picking a favorite and sticking with it is difficult because they aren't consistently made. Sometimes the wings are great, but other times they are overcooked, small and/or lacking sauce (or as in yesterday you might get the wrong sauce all together).  We try to ask for a little extra sauce on the side to overcome at least one of these issues. Yesterday was not one of the better days for wings from them, but I will order take out from them in the future (probably at least once a month). I have had other things from their menu that I would recommend like their buffalo chicken hoagie, reuben roll, and their buffalo chicken salad."}
{"text":"Best wing sauces in the city, great subs fresh bread and fresh meat!  I have order dozens of times and food is always great!!! Also the pizza is amazing, great sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Love the wings from the West Mifflin location.  We order the wings for the first time from this place and they rated one of our best wings around here that we've had."}
{"text":"Tried repeatedly to call the new place on Cochran Mill... Waste of time ... So stopped by after getting pizza from Dontes 412-655-2004 by the way. The owner??? Fat kid sitting in a boothso not an owner said at 8:30 they are closed. Don't waste your time... I gave you the number of the best pizza around"}
{"text":"They have the best wings around.. Great service and fast... They have a lot to choose from like pizza and hoagies..."}
{"text":"I had boondas today: pizza with bacon. Really pretty good. The sauce was what made it stand out. And prices are pretty good, al least for the pick up special."}
