{"text":"My fianc√©e and I were at the Peach Tree plaza today because I suggested eating in the area but he wanted to go to this restaurant. I've never been inside and when I saw the English name \"Eat with Fun\", I came back home with the total opposite, I was definitely not having fun \"on the toilet\". Usually, I would question myself of what I ate through the day before making any accusations about the cleanliness or food from the restaurant but I can swear my life I did not get served clean/ fresh food from them. I called the two combination meal (BBQ pork and cuttlefish). That was my first meal of the day and I could not eat anything else after it. I was in and out of the washroom dozens of times and was on the urge of wanting to vomit. I'm not sure how much business this place gets but we were the only table that was being served in the afternoon on a Saturday. Very upset this happened to me as my Canada Day plans were ruined and I was bedridden for most of the day. This place is in need of a health inspection immediately.   Parking: Easy Price: Paid $20 for 2 people Service: Alright, think it's a family business ?  Clean: No, considering what happened to me.  Would go again?: Not worth sitting in the toilet for hours."}
{"text":"Came here based on 2 other Yelp reviews. I was in the area and seriously craving a meat, rice, veggie, soup dish. Came for Chinese BBQ and was disappointed. Restaurant was completely empty which was a bad sign, showing cold/old meats and little turnover.   Server explained difference between bowl and dish as $1 dollar difference for WAYYYY more meat and rice. OK. She up-sold me. I plead the fifth.   The roasted pork was COLD. I kid u not. Ive never had BBQ that was cold. Warm, yes, but cold, NEVER!  The duck was nothing special, all bones no meat.   I will not return to this place."}
{"text":"This small, family-run place has been here for ages in the First Kennedy Mall, but I've only very recently tried it. For take-out, it's $11 for a 2-type BBQ platter and $14 for a 3-type BBQ platter. They fill up one of those bigger Styrofoam take-out boxes for each type and you can choose any 2 varieties. If you'd like suckling pig or squid though, they do charge a bit more.   I typically go for the BBQ pork and roast pig 2 platter which has been consistently been great in my opinion. Their chicken is nothing too special."}
{"text":"A nice little family own eatery. Ordered two orders of roast duck Over rice to go. People there are so nice and friendly, I would have love to stay and enjoy a meal there. They gave us extra veggie on the side without us asking for it. Ate the whole thing two hours later and the duck was delicious!"}
{"text":"My second review for this place... had a horrible service experience last time I was here but the food best I have ever had, was wondering if it was going to be consistent..  Less then a week later, the service was great but the Pork was a disappointment.  So I ended up talking to he guy and asking why his Pork Skin is so crust and his BBQ duck are so succulent.. he explained he never uses frozen ducks, always fresh, and he only uses medium size pigs.. most places use frozen ducks and large size pigs.. makes total sense  Only problem with today Pork was the skin wasn't crispy... obviously it was left over unsold meat from the weekend...  The duck was pretty good!!!!  The soup that came with the meal was also pretty good.  Overall, I would recommend to come here for the weekend when the pig is fresh and would recommend ordering a baby pig for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I have had breakfast many times.  The food quality is average, or below average if you are picky with HK tea cafe food.  However, the value is above average.  All are under $6, with most under $5.  Really affordable.  See the breakfast menus pictures.  BBQ meat are consistently well made."}
