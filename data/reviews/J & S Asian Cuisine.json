{"text":"We come here often. Great little place with fresh food and great service. They are kid friendly as well.  The lunch and dinner deals are good. We always enjoy the sweet and sour pork and eggplant!"}
{"text":"Really good food. For 2 people on the lunch special was under $20 plus free mango pudding.  Good service too.   Wish i got chopsticks though....."}
{"text":"The staff here is really friendly and the inside is really clean compared to some other Chinese restaurants I've been to.  The food is hit or miss. Some are good some are just ok. I get the beef and soy sauce rice noodle here which is decent. Portions are a little small."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Chinese restaurant in the area, and probably one of the top in GTA!  The ingredients are extremely fresh - you get large chunks of fresh vegetables and meat. They don't need MSG because of the quality and freshness of the ingredients!  Highly recommend this place for takeout or eat in."}
{"text":"My family went there in the evening. The decoration is refined and makes you feel comfortable. We order quite a lot of food. The chicken ball is quite different from other Asian restaurants cause it is light breaded and not greasy. I like the satay beef with vermicelli in hot pot and XO sauce shrimp with snow peas. Really tasteful.The service is quite good because the server gives a glass of water to customer who  do take out. My families are satisfied with the food and for sure we will come back."}
{"text":"This is the best Asian restaurant in Aurora .The owner is very nice always great service. Great food so delicious."}
{"text":"Very nice lady who I think is the owner but the food doesn't have any taste. My advice to any Chinese restaurant serving black bean,  black pepper, chili salt and pepper type dishes... go to NoFrills and buy 80 pounds of ginger, garlic and chili and add it to the dishes your clients order that require these ingredients. I'm so disgusted with the toned down food these days especially at Asian restaurants because theGui lau patrons can't handle any flavour. I will say the vegetables were fresh, the proteins were clean but when I order a black pepper noodle dish, guess what, I like the flavour of black pepper not the same dull brown sauce you serve with every other dish. It's great you don't use MSG and your water is filtered but please add some flavour to your food or keep selling the chicken with vegetables to the whiteys who have never heard of \"wok hay\"."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the area that I have tried.  Compares to what you can find in Markham.  I prefer the Cantonese style crispy noodles and I find that they do an excellent version compared to other places."}
{"text":"I tried this place a few times when it first opened and was impressed. But then about 5 months after something had changed in the freshness & taste of the food. (I'm specially talking about some beef dishes where I could smell & taste the stale beef) and the fried rice was extremely dry & no flavour & stale too. Those \"bad times\" were takeout orders;  So I stayed away for a bit. But I'm happy to report that they have redeemed themselves in my books again. Everyone deserves a second chance if they showed promise of something good. So I will be ordering takeout or sitting in the small modern dining room to chow down on some Chinese food.  I recently had the salted & pepper pork chops which was tender & seasoned well;not bland or too salty. I also tried the soya fried rice noodle with beef and it was tasty not too greasy as generally this type of noodle is fried with a lot of oil to prevent sticking. There was enough beef in the dish too. I had the beef & mix veg in black bean sauce & it was good too;not to many onions.  Of course what's a Chinese meal without spring rolls/ so I had those too, basic and not greasy!  It did the job of satisfying me.  I will go back soon to try some more items, but in the beginning when they first opened I had the eggplant with ground pork -very good; roti with curry sauce which was an appetizer was tasty but really small bowl of sauce which was a bit of a rip off; and wonton soup small serving but good & nice presentation.  The staff/owners are very friendly & make you feel welcome. For now I'm giving 3.5 stars as they had me on a bit of a roller coaster ride. This may get upgraded tho"}
{"text":"Food is MSG free here.  It's not bad, we have been a couple of times. It's not as flavourful as some other places we have been to, some of dishes were under salted. Price is average. The food looks good but is kind of bland, unfortunately.  Me and my partner \"mastered\" chops sticks a while ago and prefer eating with chopsticks, and it was unpleasant that we were given forks in a Chinese restaurant (I do not know if everyone is served forks, but we are Caucasian)"}
{"text":"Too many contradictions to endure.  I ordered the Salt and Pepper Shrimp, which looked enticing on the menu.  It looked delicious when it arrived.  However, it was a 3 dressed up as a 9.  14 plump, well cooked, prawn sized jumbo shrimp, in a crunchy coating, but with no flavour at all.  Truly a waste of good seafood!  You would think that one bad dish could get a pass, but let's step back a course:  I started with a small bowl of Wonton soup.  It looked really tasty, with a nice variety of greens and wontons, but the broth tasted like flavoured water.    I thought I might have found another great spot in the neighbourhood, but I could travel another 4 minutes in any direction and reach a far better experience.  And so should you..."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this new place. We usually have our fave Chinese restaurants in the area. One day, he asked me where we should go for lunch. I suggested this place, I told him its new, but who knows, we might be missing something good? Boy am I glad we did. When you come in, you are seated right away. They do not waste time in making sure the guests are attended to promptly, to think this is not common among other Asian restaurants. The interiors are tastefully decorated. I ordered the Spicy Chicken and Egg Fried Rice, and my hubby ordered Vermicelli. Big portions and very tasty. It is also a plus that they have a sign outside that says\" No MSG\". The lunch special came with deep fried spring roll and dessert. The dessert was tapioca with melon dew. Very refreshing and light. I can't help but notice that even with just 2 servers that day, the guests (seating was filled up shortly after we arrived) were served on time. To top it all, the waitress asked us how everything was and if we were satisfied with the timing. I have never been this extra pleased with both food and service. Will definitely add this one to our list of faves in Aurora."}
{"text":"Not bad for Aurora standard. Good price for the lunch special. The spring roll is a bit plain but better than too salty. Sweet and sour pork that we ordered is not authentic but taste very good. I can understand that the target market in this town may have different taste bud as Richmond hill or Markham. I wish they have more choices on the menu and serve weekend breakfast like the Hong Kong style cafe."}
