{"text":"Very cool place. Nice atmosphere, jazzy, southern music and good food. Great BBQ dishes for supper and surprisingly, they have a great egg Benedict for those weekend brunches. You gotta try out the Chipotle egg Benedict (or is it the Tex Mex...)! However, the food is not refined or highend, but then again, they're not trying to be. Simple good southern food with the ambiance to go with it! I love the place."}
{"text":"Mesquite, unfortunately, was a bit of a let-down, My boyfriend and I recently moved into the area, and were delighted to find that this little southern food joint served breakfast as well as lunch and dinner. We first went for dinner, and each got a different type of burger which comes with fries and salad. The burgers were good enough and the fries were decent, but unfortunately the salad was just a pile of lettuce, which seems to be a common problem in Montreal. We then decided to try it out for breakfast, over Cafe Orange across the street. Disappointingly, breakfast was a HUGE letdown. From the get go, we had an extremely inattentive waitress. While a busboy drop us menus off right away, we had to wait over 10 minutes for the server to come over to greet us, on a quiet Friday morning with hardly more than 3 other tables in the restaurant.  My boyfriend ordered their original benedict with the cheese on the side, and I opted for a traditional 2 eggs breakfast. When our plates finally arrived about a half hour later, my boyfriend's benedict had cheese inside AND on the side, and while he ate it all up, he made it clear that it wasn't anything to write home about. My 2 eggs breakfast came cold, with chilly scrambled eggs and potatoes that felt and tasted like they'd been sitting in a bin under a heat lamp all morning. I had ordered rye bread with my breakfast, and unfortunately the waitress didn't bring it over to our table until we were already done our meal, with the excuse that they had to send someone to the store to by the bread. Fair enough, but when I picked it up, it was COMPLETELY waterlogged and soggy.  While the waitress was apologetic and nice enough, in general she was useless and we waited WAY too long in an empty restaurant for a disappointing and cold meal.   We won't be returning for breakfast anytime soon, and unfortunately the prices are so out of control for their dinner menu (22$ for a salad?) that I doubt we'll be going back at all.  Overall, disappointing."}
{"text":"Both the ribs and pulled pork were tender. You have a choice of sauce and can have the sauce on the side. I chose the latter so that it didn't overpower the taste of the meat.   For Montreal, you would be hardpressed to find better ribs and pulled pork.   A bit pricey, but not bad.   Atmosphere was ok. All red inside with a bar that had two TV's and a seating area in another room.   The service was excellent."}
{"text":"The outside is cute with a nice sign outside to make sure you won't miss it. But the inside is very average. It's as if they took a pre-existing restaurant painted it with colors that say smokehouse and blues music and slapped on some blues and jazz music icons laminates on the walls and called it a BBQ restaurant. Let's just say it looks a little Spartan décor wise and could use a bit of a sprucing up. But they played a great array of Blues nonstop. And the best smokehouses I've been too in Texas didn't even have plates; you were served on a piece of parchment paper layered at the bottom of a cafeteria tray. So I digress. Let's attack the food shall we?  THE GOOD  Everything...really. They bring us a small basket of chili cornbread with spicy whipped butter spread. I could have fed on those buns alone all night.  I started with an entrée of ribs. This was almost a small meal, not an entrée but DAAAMMNNNNNNNNN. This is smoked ribs the likes of which cannot be found in Montreal - unless more Southern BBQ joints can be found in Montreal of which I'm not aware - and are supremely well prepared. I could taste the smoke and the wood in the meat. I'm sure the rub is a well guarded secret but I would kill for it. It was well balanced. Not harsh but certainly not flat. And I'll say this without hesitation that these were the best ribs I've ever had in Montreal.  As the main I had the combo platter - because I wanted to sample as much as possible for my first test drive - which consisted of Pulled Pork, Brisket and 2 sides of my choice. I picked the Mac'n'Cheese and the Shaved Fried Onions. The Mac'n'Cheese was a bit peppery but made with freshly grated cheese, this was certainly not KD. The Shaved Fried Onions was insanely delicious and any steakhouse and burgerhouse should pay them for their recipe. My friend also had a side of Baked Beans with Jack Daniels... AWESOME! Sweet, Tasty perfectly cooked beans and the JD after taste really had some kick to it.  I've never been a big fan of BBQ Brisket and this one was cut a big thick in my opinion but it was worth the detour for any Brisket fan. And of course there's my personal favorite, Pulled Pork. If you've never had Pulled Pork, you've never had pork; it's the way it was to be. And Mesquite certainly doesn't screw it. It was so good I had to sit in the back of my chair and close my eyes and let it all soak in. Flaky, fall apart full-flavored smokey goodness. I can't really describe it but fans of Pulled Pork with thoroughly get their fix here at Mesquite.  THE BAD  Now I don't have much in the way of bad to say. Except that every Texan smokehouse I've been to served their ribs dry and they pretty much make fun of Yankees with their over-sugared and wet ribs. But I could see in the kitchen that the sauce was added at the preparation part, not the smoking part so I'll just order them dry next time. Same goes for the Pulled Pork and Brisket. I like them wet, just not drowned in it. So the bad really isn't about the food, but the presentation which can be fixed as you order.  And I know it's a smokehouse but not self-respecting southern establishment is complete without the fried chicken. I mean where's the Southern Fried Chicken? That would be a great addition. Here in Montreal our Fried Chicken options are meager - KFC DOES NOT COUNT. Wouldn't be great to have a place that serve homemade Fried Chicken drizzled with sweet golden honey?  Also in Texas, Dr. Pepper is king. Hell they still make it with real sugar there and not corn syrup. So I ordered Dr. Pepper seeing as my BBQ sauce is made with Dr. Pepper. Denied. Which made wonder on the authenticity of the sauce. Was it made on site or purchased in bottles? Which brings us to...  THE UGLY  Desert. Both deserts were obviously store bought factory made over-sweet sugar-rockets. I mean I ordered Apple Crumble Pie, thinking I'd get some awesome homemade crumble but no, it tasted like something taken off the shelf at Costco. This was a disappointment. The restaurant had so far Prefontained itself through BBQ heaven and then tripped, broke a leg and failed to finish the race with a nice homemade desert. Apple Crumble, so easy to make how could you buy it from a factory? Fail.  THE SHOWDOWN  In the end, best ribs in town, awesome, awesome pulled pork. I only wish I was in delivery range - but again this may be a good thing for my health - and I will definitely return often since as far as I know it's the only smokehouse in town and they now have a loyal customer in me. I'm going back as soon as I can and bringing friends."}
