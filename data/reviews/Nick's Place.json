{"text":"Great local/neighborhood place to eat! We ordered Gyros and will definitely be going back for more soon!! The service was fast and courteous - they even called to let us know our food was ready earlier than expected! Cool place!"}
{"text":"I have stopped here over the years and it is always a positive experience. Good gyros and I think it's one of the best places to come and get full!!. Friendly local area that is a landmark."}
{"text":"Nick's used to be good with the previous owner, that all changed. Which is pretty sad."}
{"text":"The gyro wedgie is my go-to menu item, and it's awesome,  but I've also had their pizza, and for the price, it's just alright.  I would have rated them higher, but sometimes they just don't answer the phone during their posted business hours.  This led me to try other pizza places in the neighborhood, and I saw what I as missing. If you want a gyro wedgie, don't go anywhere else,  but if its just pizza your looking for, I highly recommend going elsewhere (Doughboys, DiPietro's, or Cerasoli's...just to name a few)."}
{"text":"I haven't had their pizza in years.. not  because of my choice but to the fact they never answer their phone. Personally, it's not worth all the aggravation for sub par pizza & steep prices!"}
{"text":"Small gyro shop with big portions! Orders are ready pretty fast and the prices are good too."}
{"text":"Nick's has legit New York Style pizza.  It's dirt cheap too!"}
{"text":"Although I've never had any of their other menu items except their gyro, I wish I would have gone elsewhere. Since I can only comment on their gyro; here goes... First, the meat is embroiled with fatty particles (it's fake meat or something), second; they don't include enough dressing, third; there are way, way too many onions, forth; there were only two very small slices of tomatoe, fifth; the feta cheese is not crumbled but in a patty, sixth; they just pile the stuff on top of a pita, - to be quite honest, it just tastes bad."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a wedding and it was delicious!  My mom had the blt hoagie, she said it was the best blt she's ever had.  The bacon was crispy and not greasy, perfect amount of tomato, lettuce, and mayo.  I had the gyro.  The meat was perfect and it was a very large portion.  My sister had the fried zucchini and popcorn shrimp and fries.  Everything was perfectly cooked and delicious.  Plus reasonably priced.  We'll def go there again."}
{"text":"Nick's is standard pizza.  Nothing special but an enjoyable eat.  We ordered a pepperoni and sausage pizza for take out.  Decent amount of toppings but not overflowing.  We also got wings.  They were ok but nothing special.

I'd come back but not go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Their gyros are unbelievable. Pizza is the best I've had around here, but it's not the best I've ever had. I'm all about supporting local businesses though and this place is exactly that! :)"}
{"text":"Best gyro you will ever have in your life. They really give you a ton of meat. You basically get two gyros for the price of one that's how big it is. It tastes simply amazing. The fries are average, but the gyro is to die for. Pizza is decent here too."}
