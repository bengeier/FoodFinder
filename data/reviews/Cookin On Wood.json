{"text":"A small, quirky, cheap place that hits the spot for lunch. Anytime a BBQ places cooks the meat in the parking lot out front, you know it's going to be good. Inside, it's small and almost awkwardly quiet, but the tri tip is tasty and the price is unbelievable. I'd go back to this hidden BBQ joint."}
{"text":"These folks catered an event for us and it was just awesome!  They were organized, professional and friendly, however the food was off the charts!"}
{"text":"I have really mixed feelings about Cookin On Wood!  They cook their meat on wood, on Wood St.  Play on words? I like it already. Daily lunch specials are priced low... when a co-worker and I called to inquire about the pricing of the rest of the menu, we found it suspiciously cheap.  $5 lunch?  I'm still tracking. We pulled up to what looked like an office building in an industrial neighborhood.  We know for sure because it's the neighborhood our office is in.  Inside, there were maybe 3 tables, a refrigerator, a cart with napkins, silverware, etc, and a hostess at a cash register.  Weird, and I felt like we required some instruction, but on we go. After we get our food and pay via Square, we grabbed our BBQ sauce from the cart (one per customer, or add additional sauces for .50 cents), salad dressing from the fridge and headed back to work with a bag packed full of food for under $15.  Feeling pretty good about ourselves. Back at the office, we opened the food and there was a good size burrito, a lot of food in the tri-tip plate dish, and an average quesadilla that included salsa and sour cream... whew! The tri-tip was mine, and it tasted really good.  It was quite tough though.  The ranch beans on the side tasted like chili beans, and I was not a fan.  And my side-salad was super typical, but that's what I like.  I saved half for the next day, and went back to work satisfied. The next day, the leftovers were not good.  I can't seriously dock them for day-old food not tasting great and fresh, but some places (Little Miss!) provide awesome leftovers for later.  The tough meat had not magically gotten tender, and most of the flavor had evaporated.    My plan for next time is to order something else.. maybe a burrito or chicken sandwich.. but I'll definitely try them again because of the super low prices."}
{"text":"Did not except great food! Super cheap, lots of food, and the tritip/chicken combo so delish!"}
{"text":"Quality food for a great price. I got the combo platter Tri-tip steak and chicken dish. Came with two sides and garlic bread for less than $7.  The food tastes just like a family BBQ and I left full.  Everything on the menu is excellent if you love BBQ steak, chicken and burgers and more. Pretty sure every combo on the menu is less than $7.   I'll be back for sure.."}
{"text":"Great service, good food, great prices, and awesome people.  Their specialty is the tri-tip and it is awesome.  They grill out front so you see what you are getting.  It is a small family run business and they have awesome catering as well."}
{"text":"Quick!  You only have 3 hours a day to enjoy some great BBQ in a very unassuming location.  The hospitality, quality of food, and value is worth the try. Reminds me of the TV series \" The Office\" if they had a restaurant in their lobby."}
{"text":"This is a great little place. Kind if off the beaten path but we'll worth it. The food is great quality and very well priced. Always check the daily specials, everything has been great."}
{"text":"I went there with a work buddy and it was not at all good. I do not understand how anyone gives this place 4 stars. I think two stars is generous. The food isn't gross or anything, just bland and boring. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Not the most delicious BBQ in the area, but definitely the least expensive. I've had the chicken burrito (added bacon) and the tri-tip burrito. Both were fresh and of decent size. Added a side of garlic bread (tasty, soft and only a dollar) and a slice of chocolate cake (moist, scrumptous and also only a dollar). Needless to say..."}
{"text":"Amazing food cooked over wood! Outstanding service and unbelievable flavors! I can't put them into words,you will have to come and try for yourself! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"best BBQ in the valley. tritip is on point. ask for \"Ryan\" and he'll add dakine special sauce. when you eat it you be like \"BONGO!\""}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a coworker and its a 3min drive from my office, its great that they have lunch specials that change every weeks to keep it interesting also prices are very affordable. Everything I've tried I've loved, also all employees are suuuupee nice! I go there prob too much :)"}
{"text":"Pretty decent little place in an industrial park area. Super small inside. There are about three tables that will seat a total of twelve people. There are a couple of tables outside too. Kind of reminds me of a very small caf√© in an office bldg. The food is cooked outside on grills and you can notice the difference in taste and flavor. I had the chicken platter with homemade mashed potato's and fresh green beans. The meal was around $5.50. Pretty decent price for a filling lunch. Good service and friendly staff. Your best to do carry out since there is limited seating and the parking lot has limited spaces."}
{"text":"For under 6 bucks you can have yourself some smoked BBQ goodness. Tucked away in a business park area, but they are cranking out some top notch BBQ. I Usually get the chicken platter for $5.50! You can taste the smokiness, and you get 2 sides! Check it out."}
{"text":"This is a small little out of the way place in the industrial part of town.  They have a tiny little dining room plus a couple tables outside.  I chose inside since it was 107 and I'm from Michigan.  They cook on an outdoor wood barbecue.  They serve the food on heavy duty paper plates with plastic ware, but that is fine because the meat is cooked so well and tender that is all you need.  I got a combo plate.  It comes with chicken and tri tips, 2 sides (I chose potato salad and cole slaw) plus you get garlic bread all for $6.95.  It was delicious!  It is a popular place that does take out.  Everyone seems to know about it.  There were factory workers coming and going buying take out.  Try it out sometime."}
{"text":"The food here is really good, especially for the price.  Unfortunately they're closed until April 8, 2018. That's what the sign on the door said."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and the special was $5.50. It's a small space so probably not great for a group although I hear they cater. No complaints other than having to order from the register and then come back to pay after your done eating."}
{"text":"I stopped by this spot for lunch and the first thing I noticed is that there is almost no room in the parking lot for parking. Although there are more than two tables at the restaurant there are only two parking spots. You will have to call in a pick up order or park on the street.  I ordered the 1/2 lb Hamburger and the Tri Tip burrito. The burger was underwhelming as their patties were obviously store bought and previously frozen and not made in house which is odd considering the star of the show is their tri-tip, which normally represents access to high quality beef.  The tri-tip burrito had very little tri-tip inside of it and was mostly a bean burrito. The seasoning on the ranch-style beans they used grossly overpowered the rich taste of the meat.  I will unfortunately not be visiting this establishment again as it appears to cater mostly to hungry college kids which has shifted their focus away from producing quality food."}
