{"text":"Had a great meal! The cheese curds were a great start. Prepared differently than most places but a must try! 

For dinner I had the fish. It was huge and prepared perfectly!  Best cole slaw I've ever had and I was in cole slaws birthplace last week: Qatar.  Everyone in my group enjoyed their individual meals. 

I will definitely be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of pubs - they mostly seem to have generic interiors, bored staff and awful food (well the ones I've been to, anyway). But this place is different. 

Nothing about the menu is boring - lots of options, including healthy ones. The Californian salad is my favorite. It's huge, and IMO salad goes great with beer. This was also the location for the worst meal I've ever enjoyed. We came in for their Sunday brunch on our way to go camping one weekend... and I decided it was a good idea to try their french toast cinnamon roll. Terrible idea! But delicious! It was saturated in syrup and coated in cream cheese. It was the best thing that I will never consume again. 

The service has always been terrific. We never wait long and the servers always have good recommendations."}
{"text":"I only go here when every other brunch place is too busy. There is a reason they always have a table, namely bad food and bad service. There is no need to ever go here. Wait for a table elsewhere."}
{"text":"We went here to watch a Badger game. Things started out well - we got good seats at the bar and the Bloody Mary was good. That's the one star. Food and service were bad. We ordered the fries for me and a Reuben with cole slaw for my husband. The Reuben, coleslaw and fries came out on the same plate. Annoying, but I dealt with it. 

The fries were awful - limp, soggy and cold. When I asked the bartender about the chef's sauce that was supposed to accompany the fries, he seemed surprised that I wanted it. Um, if it's menued as coming with a sauce, I expect it to come with a sauce... He put the sauce order in and I waited, and waited, and waited. 15 minutes later, I get a cup of mayo with a squirt of BBQ sauce on top. Seriously? That took 15 minutes to \"make\"? By then, my fries were even worse and not worth eating. 

The Reuben was nothing special, but it wasn't bad. The coleslaw were just as bad as the fries, though. Soggy and watery with no flavor. I honestly had no idea that food as basic as fries and coleslaw could be that bad. 

Don't waste your time or money here. You're better off at the Great Dane (better beer there, too!)"}
{"text":"Felt like a pest. 

I really wanted to like this place but after how we were treated, I will never be back.
I was meeting my friends for lunch on this fine Friday afternoon, I arrived before they did and, despite the sign, was able to get a table outside before my entire party arrived. That was great service, but the service stopped there. 
The waitress was rude and treated us like we were bothering her by eating there. My food was cold and disappointing, do not order the chili, the chicken sandwich ordered by my friend was also cold and the server forgot to my other friends salad. when ordering drinks we we rudely dismissed when asking about their beers. I ordered another drink, after finishing my first, that never came. We asked to pay and had got an eye roll when we asked for separate checks- one of which took 15 minutes to appear. 
The entire time she kept trying to rush us and treated us like we were pests. 

I work in a large hotel here in Madison and have been to almost every restaurant downtown. This was one of the rudest places I have ever been to, I will not be back and I will not be recommending it to any of the hotel's guests."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. It wasn't too busy as many downtown businesses had the day off. The choices on the menu are appealing. I ordered a chicken sandwich (has an odd name, can't think of it) and my daughter ordered an appetizer. It took a L - O - N - G time for the food to arrive, and our waitress stood looking into the kitchen rather than visiting our table to apologize for the delay. The food was good when it arrived and we both enjoyed the meal. There are a few TV's around the bar showing sports and the music was an eclectic mix of disco, 50s and 60s tunes (?). Likely we'll return but not when we're watching the clock."}
{"text":"Love the beer, but the food... not so much.  To be fair, I have only been there once and was the only one eating.  Fries were pretty good, but the po boy sandwich was really not good.
Great place for really good Capital beer and probably some snacks.  Wouldn't recommend it for a full meal."}
{"text":"Do not sit in the big booth in the back of the restaurant!! I sat there with my friends for my birthday celebration and the staff kept going in and out of the back door.  IT WAS FREEZING and they did not apologize.  

When ordering drinks, the waitress knew nothing about the different types of beers.  She also made no effort to find out information about beers.  She was VERY unprofessional. 

When finishing up our meal, their system \"went down\" when trying to come up with our bill.  We waited for 20 minutes and then the waitress came back saying she would write out and try doing some math to figure out people's bills and that they would accept cash or write down credit card numbers and charge them once the system was up.  She was clearly not able to calculate the tabs.  I then approached the bar after another 20 minutes saying we don't have cash (what college students do these days?) and we do not feel comfortable writing down our credit card numbers (isn't that absurd that was their solution!).  The waitress threw a fit and walked away from me- she wouldn't even talk to me.  Then another waitress very rudely said their system would be up in 5 minutes.

After another 10 minutes they brought 1 bill for all the meals.  I then asked if we could split up the charges.  The waitress could not understand how or why we wanted to split the bills.  I was so annoyed at this point I put everything on my credit card.

I then tried to speak with the manager.  She was even more unprofessional and did not apologize for anything.  Nothing was compensated for us and overall she was just as rude.  

If you want horrible service and some subpar food, go to Capitol Tap Haus!"}
{"text":"Had friends in town so there were three of us to start plus one that came later. They didn't appear to have the beers in stock that they have on the wall.  The wait staff seemed dumb and annoyed if you tried to figure things out. The \"host\" (older guy with whiting hair) appeared very annoyed that we were there still drinking beer in our booth after dining and in a huff removed some used napkins from the table. My guest said, \"well, I guess that means it's time to go\"  so true, and we'll never go back. Jerks."}
{"text":"Came here late night for Autumnal Fire. Good beer, not my style, but I can appreciate it. We also had some apps - very delish. Pub fare with a little uumph."}
{"text":"Good beer.  Decent food.  Slow table service.  Really slow.  Drink at the bar or go elsewhere, unless you have time to kill waiting for the staff to pay attention to you."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience at Capital. I got the salmon entree and it was cooked perfectly and tastes awesome! Waiter was punctual and nice. Bar can get a little loud, but outdoor seating would solve that. Try the deep-fried zucchini!"}
{"text":"I had the oyster po' boy the other day and it was the best I've had in Madison.  The remoulade was very unique and the oysters were fresh and meaty.  On the side I had the frites--which you could tell were homemade--along with the chef sauce which was an interesting touch.  I'll be back again.  I saw someone else at the bar taking a piece of fish that looked like it covered half his plate!"}
{"text":"Was a good place for capital drinks, we ordered the pretzel and really enjoyed it. Worth coming back."}
{"text":"the food was amazing! staff great, good beer flights, very cheap for such high quality food. this is a tap haus done right! the BLT with salmon and avocado was awesome, but my wife's sherried oyster and mushroom soup stole the show and i don't like oysters."}
{"text":"The beer is the only good thing.  Two of us went in at 830 and ordered food which was not presented to us until 920. We ordered soup&salad and a sandwhich so it wasn't something that should have taken that long.  People sitting next to is arrived 10 minutes later and got food 10 minutes sooner than us. We politely pointes this out and got only a shrug and a limp apollogy. The service was bad. The place was not busy but the servers were unattentive and didn't offer to get me another beer after I finished the first and still was waiting for our food 40 minutes after ordering. The food was nothing special.  When I asked for the check, the server grabbed my finally provided 2nd beer which I had only half finished! Clearly, they want you to wait forever for your food and then get you out quickly. Just bad bad service. Also there was no airflow or air conditioning on a warm August evening.  I like Cap brews, but I'm not going back to their restaurant."}
{"text":"I visited here with my boyfriend during the week of July 4th.  The bar was not full, but the bartender took about 20 minutes to get our drinks.  On top of that, she ended up dropping a TON of glasses on the floor which shattered and FLEW UP AND ONTO ME and the immediate area.  I spent the next 30 minutes looking and picking glass out of my scalp and my body.  After mentioning to get a new soda because THERE MIGHT BE GLASS IN IT, she got another soda, never apologized that I had a small glass factory in my hair (and yes, it cut a bunch of hair out), and charged me for the soda.  Lame.  She was more concerned with her toe hurting than the fact that her guests might be bleeding or ingesting broken glass.  I'm not talking about maybe either, I'm talking about huge pieces that landed all over."}
{"text":"You have to to try the beer battered cheese curds and reuben rolls!

*And come on a Sunday whenever Pat is working to wash it all down with a delicious bloody mary of his!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my friend and her boyfriend.  We went because none us had been there before and we wanted to sit outside.  None of us were really struck by anything on the menu, there was a just a weird variety of choices.  I went in wanting a salad because it was hot out, but the large salad was 8 or 9 dollars, and it is 4 dollars to add chicken to that.  Too much in my opinion (and granted healthier options do tend to cost more).  My friend and I ended up getting the burger and her boyfriend got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich.  The sandwiches come with a side salad or coleslaw and we all opted for the salad because if you want fries that will cost you an extra 3 dollars (half the price of my burger).  Again ridiculous. Our burgers were fine, not bad, not great.  The menu said they were served on a pretzel roll, and neither of our rolls seemed at all pretzel-y.  The side salad was pretty pathetic, it was shredded lettuce and big chunks of onion.  It made me glad I didn't order a large salad. 
The BBQ pork was supposed to come with coleslaw on the sandwich, but since my friend wanted the side salad they didn't give him the coleslaw that was supposed to come on the sandwich.  Our waitress was nice about getting him the coleslaw and explained that the kitchen doesn't put coleslaw on the sandwich (that the menu says comes with coleslaw on it) if the person gets the side salad rather than the side of coleslaw.  She said that she has to specify to the kitchen whether or not they want coleslaw on the sandwich and whether or not they want coleslaw or a salad on the side as well.  Makes things more complicated than necessary.  If you want to drink Capital beer pick some up at the grocery store and skip this place."}
{"text":"The Restaurant Biz is tough.  You only get one chance to make a first impression.  My first impression of this place is not so good.  My incredibly simple order was a bowl of soup and a small salad.  Nearly 30 minutes later, my meal arrived.  The place was not busy, about 1/3 full.  There was no indication that the person waiting on me was concerned at all.  She represents me in the kitchen.  She should be on them to get the simple order out.  Again, soup and salad.  Should have taken 5 minutes.  Lunch needs to be pretty quick.   There was no apology, no explanation for the long delay.  The salad was above average and the soup was quite good.   Service must improve or customers like me will travel to one of the dozen other places near the square where I can get good food without a half hour wait.

*** UPDATE   I returned to give them another chance.  Today's lunch was served much quicker and the waitstaff apologized for my last visit.  The salad was delicious:  The Continental and the Beer and Cheese soup was hot and good.   my only slight complaint today was that I was asked if i wanted a refill, then was charged for that.  I didn't expect that, but it may be on the menu.  not sure.   12-2-10"}
{"text":"This place is really hit or miss. Was in there not too long ago and ordered a cup of seafood chowder. It was awful. I wasn't upset at the fact that the soup was bad, it was that the server didn't care at all. I asked if I could trade it in for a small side salad, or the other soup, and she told me that she wasn't allowed to do anything for me. I don't think I was asking for much, the soup was just OVERLY fishy... so I left paying for my awful soup and still hungry. It was a disappointment."}
{"text":"This is our State Street tradition. Perfect for before a show at Overture and we'll worth the wait on a Farmer's Market Saturday. 

Great curds and fantastic burger. The star on the menu is the fish fry with haddock. 

The servers and bartenders have been here since it it opened and are fantastic."}
{"text":"The food was good.  The service was poor.  It was so dark at our table it was difficult to see the menu and impossible to read the receipt.  The server added an 18% gratuity that should have been reserved for tables of 8 or more so she ended up with a 33% tip.   We were charged $5 more than the quoted cost of the \"special\" and $3 more than the menu price for a burger (no extras).
Watch your bill!"}
{"text":"I popped in for a late lunch by the Capital after running some errands. Service was prompt and very cordial. It's your typical brew-pub with dark wood tables, chairs and bar. Clean, dimly lit with some inviting oldies music playing through the mounted Bose system. 

As usual, I ordered my customary Fish and Chips entree. This is their Fish Fry Friday Every Day which is a whole fileted haddock beer battered. Ok. The fish was the star of this plate. Great size for a $13 meal, fried to a perfect crisp without being heavy, and the meat flakes like nobody's business. Served with salt and peppered real potato fries and coleslaw. Fries were  good, but I would have liked to see them be more creative with the tartar and coleslaw. Just a bit dry and bland on the slaw. 

I need to come back for their beer flights and other meals. Solid experience."}
{"text":"This place is great for beer and dinner food or appetizers but I wouldn't recommend their brunch.. It wasn't very good and I wouldn't go back for brunch. They did have 1$ mamosas but I didn't try them. I would recommend the pumpkinator beer though, it's great!"}
{"text":"Got the tour from guide Alan.  What a great tour he gave!  Really enjoyed it.  We had a pitcher of the blonde dopplebock which was terrific too.  Nice place, a little older than some of the older breweries in Madison area but it certainly had character.  Would definitely return for the patio in the warmer months!"}
{"text":"Ordered their chicken sandwich. Although the chicken was under seasoned, their sourdough bread was yummy. The asparagus salad and fries were both good.

Just your typical pub-food restaurant. Nothing out of this world."}
{"text":"Stopped in on New Year's Eve on our way to a hockey game.  The manager asked if we were headed to the game, and had the kitchen put a rush on our dinner.  The beer was good, and the fish fry was as good as I'd had anywhere else.  I couldn't get a stout or a porter, but other than that, it was terrific.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had a gift certificate for the Capital Tap Haus and thought I'd give it a try for lunch.  I ordered the chicken breasts with mixed seasonal vegetables and mashed potatoes and Californian side salad.  The salad was great, albeit quite small for the $6 price tag.  I was quite disappointed with the entree though.  The chicken breast was dry and cold.  The seasonal vegetables consisting of yellow and green zucchini and spinach were soaked in olive oil, not seasoned at all and cold as well.  To top it off, I felt sick 20 minutes after eating the meal, which may or may not be related to the food but does not bode well for the establishment.  The only redeeming quality of the experience was the service; the waitress was really nice.  Perhaps try the place out for a drink but from this experience, I'll be staying away from the food."}
{"text":"I am next door neighbors with the actual Capital Brewery in Middleton so I was rooting for this experience to be awesome. Therefore, it's very sad for me to have to say that my experience here last night was pretty cringe-worthy. 

We ended up at Capital Tap Haus after finding out that there was no way our group of 6 was going to get a table for Team Trivia at Tipsy Cow five minutes before it began. Someone suggested this place as an alternative, and they had Trivia at 8:30, so in we went.

We were seated and the waiter came over to take our drink orders. We each ordered either a beer or soda and waters all around. We also requested that they turn on the Brewer's game, which  the server enthusiastically agreed to do.

10 minutes pass. No water. No drinks. TV channel still showing not-Brewers.

A member of our party (politely) flagged down a different server and requested the Brewer's game on TV. This server also agreed to do it for us. 10 more minutes pass and the game still isn't on.

This went on for awhile, and it seemed like it was taking forever for them to change the channel and bring water. The restaurant was almost empty too, so there wasn't much excuse for the extremely inattentive service. In the end, we had to ask 2 or 3 different people FOUR times for the Brewer's game before they turned it on! It also took way too long to get our water and drinks.

This alone didn't ruin the experience for me...what ruined the experience was that nothing else about the night was good either. Service continued to be slow and inattentive. The  general consensus of our table was that that food was overpriced and mediocre. For example, they charge $3.00 for a side of regular fries with any sandwich or burger, and the fries were served cold and soggy. I know rent on State St. is expensive, but really? 

The one saving grace  of my otherwise dismal experience, and the reason I refrained from giving the Capital Tap Haus  one star, was that the sandwich I ordered, a Reuben, was very tasty. I would say that it ranked in the upper 20% of Reubens that I've had in my life: Thick and toasty marble rye, flavorful and *tender* corned beef, tangy, but not overpowering sauerkraut, and \"perfect-amount-of sweet\" thousand island dressing.

Would I return to the Capital Tap Haus? Probably not anytime soon."}
{"text":"The Capital Tap Haus is a small bar with a couple of TV screens. They brew all their beers locally with the brewery just on the outskirts of Madison. This is an extension of the other main location they have. They have several different beers on tap which makes it nice to try new ones. I tried their Oktoberfest and wasn't a huge fan because it was a little bit bitter, but everyone was ordering it and it seemed to be well received. The size of the bar is fairly small seating about 40 people tops. It was fairly empty on a rainy Wednesday evening but I could see it being a bit more busy on a weekend evening."}
{"text":"You know when you're eating something and its kings of off,  so you chew it wth your back teeth to avoid really tasting it? That's what this place is like.  Everything sounds good in the menu,  but nothing really plans out on the plate.  Pass."}
{"text":"The service and beer were great, but the food was only average.  The cheese curds were a smashed, greasy glob and the beer cheese dip for the Giant Bavarian Pretzel was almost devoid of any taste.  We did really enjoy the deep-fried pickle spears and the dip that came with them."}
{"text":"I ordered the schnitzel on a biscuit and the pork and cheddar potato cakes during brunch. Everything was so under seasoned and my potato pancakes were dry and cheddar less. My server didn't even bring the regular menu for us so we were stuck with very limited brunch menu. Their mimosa deal is great but other than that stay. away. from their brunch."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a bite around 11AM after visiting the Farmer's Market. 

My boyfriend and I asked to sit at a window table so we could people-watch and were told 'no' because it's a bigger table.  The girl said \"on Saturday's it's reserved for larger parties and in 45 minutes, we're going to be slammed.\" Well, we ate our food, they never got slammed and the table sat unused. I get it, but I was still bothered.

We each had a $5 pint of Imperial IPA which was not good at all. Our burgers were good and cooked right. I paid the extra $3 for fries and they weren't worth it.

Service was very good. I like the interior of the restaurant, very nice.

We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Great local beers, nice tap room, and a great place to go on a nice summer day.  They make a wide variety of beers on site to suit just about anyone's taste in beer, and the prices are very reasonable.  The tap room is small, but the atmosphere is nice.  Besides, if you go on a nice day, you're really going to want to be outside anyway.  The patio is nice, and surrounded by a lot of lush green space.  There is often live music and beers flowing at an outdoor bar, but even if there is no entertainment, the quality of the beer and the surroundings make it well worth the trip.  There is also a nice gift shop if you want to support the local business and show off your love of good Wisconsin beer."}
{"text":"I like this little classy place. It is pretty nice with LOTS of great brews. I got here pretty late a couple times but it is awesome! It has a gorgeous bar with some very classy items behind the bar such as their brass taps. They have beautiful booths that let you settle in and relax. Their staff? fantastic! really nice and really fast with drink orders. It isn't the biggest place on state but it has an awesome relaxing feel. It is one of those places to grab an afterwork drink with friends and co-workers! Their beers are crafted expertly yet they aren't too expensive!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast around 11:30 am. I live on the east side, and my companion was looking for a Bloody Mary. We got seated right away and ordered our drinks.

Bloody Mary was an A+. Annual beers were also $3 until noon, so I ordered one of my favorites - the Amber.

I ordered the bacon/egg breakfast sandwich and it came with potatoes and fruit. Absolutely one of the most amazing breakfast sandwiches, no doubt due to the generous helpings of butter, cheese, and garlic aioli. I could have done without the potatoes being breaded and then fried, but they were still tasty.

My boyfriend was also very happy with the bratwurst omelette."}
{"text":"Great beer and the best Pulled Pork Sandwich I've ever had. The BBQ sauce is amazing!!"}
{"text":"I like the \"dive\" ambiance of this location, but their beers are pretty nasty, I'm sorry. I did a tasting while in town visiting at 2 different locations and there was not a single one that I enjoyed, honestly. I finally ordered a pint of the least offensive and struggled to get it all down. I had zero interest in staying as I didn't want another pint of anything they brew. 

After 3 weeks in Madison and trying as many local brews as possible, I came to the conclusion that Great Dane and Capital are not good breweries in terms of my taste preferences. Asylum Ale is the big dawg in town and is the force to be reckoned with in Madison. That's my final analysis and I'm sticking to it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in to try some beers on a Saturday afternoon and it was packed. We waited probably 10-15 minutes for a small high-top table next to the packed bar. We both ordered a couple beers which were OK but not great.

Our server asked what we'd like to order and we told her we just wanted to try a couple beers, we'd already had something to eat earlier. She responded saying she'd \"have to ask us to leave\" because they only allow people who are ordering food at the tables. Being that the bar was packed and there was a perimeter of 2-3 people standing around it, that didn't really seem like such a great suggestion to a paying customer. I seriously couldn't believe I'd just been told to leave the establishment because I wasn't ordering food. That was a 1st for me and the last time I'll ever visit or purchase anything from that brewery. Luckily none of their beers are that great anyway..."}
{"text":"We had dinner before the theater. Cheese curds were salty. Food was good. Service was average. The atmosphere  was great."}
{"text":"Went here for a quiet Wednesday night dinner. I hadn't been to the Tap Haus in a couple of years. My prior experiences had been unremarkable, but solid. This time around, some pros and cons.

They have a nice number of taps (12ish?), of course featuring exclusively Middleton, WI's Capital Brewery. This brewery is predictably drinkable, tho lacking a certain edge. I had their Winter Skal, which was on special for $3 a pint. Yum. 

Their fries are well seasoned and tasty (although calling them \"frites\" just doesn't quite fit the style of fry in my book). Their fried pickles with ranch dipping sauce are just as decadently salty as they sound. The Reuben was heavy but flavorful, the meat having been chopped and mixed with a creamy-mayo concoction...though if you're ordering a Reuben with fries, you're probably not on a diet anyway.

A couple of disappointments were the bland and dry chicken club, which barely had any of the guacamole listed as a topping on the menu, and (ok, let me explain) the ketchup. The ketchup was in a Heinz bottle, but definitely tasted, as my boyfriend succinctly put it, \"like watered-down tomato paste.\" Details like this always make me question where else the restaurant is cutting corners...

All in all, fine, but I'm not rushing back."}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: comfortable tied-house.

Capital Tap Haus is like the pub-extension of the Capital Brewery in a nearby suburb, but located on the busiest foot-traffic street in Madison. Right off the square, it couldn't be in a better spot. The interior is wood-warm, and the servers are friendly. I prefer to take my beer out to the street patio. All in all, Capital Tap Haus is a good place for a local pint and a bite."}
{"text":"My husband and i came for dinner... waiting 5 min at host stand before someone came to seat us. They said let me clear a table. We sat and the table was sticky from old drinks spilt in it. The waitress came we ordered right away. It seemed they were under staffed even though the restaurant its self wasnt full or crazy busy.  I said i wanted a plain chicken breast and side of veggies. She came back and said sorry we can only do it w butter. I dont understand how u cant get a grilled chicken breast but ok.  So i changed it to something off the app menu. It was grilled veggies and bread. It was horrible.. i was expecting  it to be warm not fridge cold. Even the toasted cheap white bread was fridge cold. So it must have been plated for the night sitting in the fridges... grill means warm in my mind? Why would i want cold grilled veggies?  My husband had a pulled pork sandwich and it was warm at best with frys that were cold. It was a disappointment..

Also we had a bloody... sounds really good on the menu but its just pre mixed tomato juice no flavor."}
{"text":"The beer's drinkable but doesn't live up to its station in the shadow of the Capitol -- almost all of them, from the amber ale through the wheat to the pale ales, tasted roughly the same. The IPAs were distinguished from the others by their bitterness, and not in a good way. It's almost like they came out of one of those homebrewing kits with the powder mixes. The food was perfectly okay -- had the veggie antipasto and beer cheese soup. But apparently they were running out of both beer AND servers, and had to recruit a cocktail waitress from next door who knew nothing about beer, and several taps from Three Floyds (which were of course the standout.) Sadly kinda felt like a sinking ship..."}
{"text":"As an alum of the UW, I've got a special place in my heart for The Capital Brewery.  I love their beer, Island Wheat being my favorite and it's always on tap at The Capital Tap Haus.  The food is wonderful as well, my wife and I love the fact that they use their beer in many of the dishes.  The cheese curds are absolutely out of this world!  You must try them if you go here!  The Capital Tap Haus gets 5 stars in my book!"}
{"text":"Came in on a snowy Saturday afternoon. The place was pretty empty, but I don't think that ever excuses our server for taking a nap at the bar. This surprisingly didn't affect his attentiveness to us (he was timely and asked us how we were doing multiple times), however still doesn't make the place look very professional. 

The food was okay. I had the Beer Cheese Soup which was actually very good. I would order it again. I also had a half salad which was honestly gross. The lettuce was old and wilting and the toppings pretty un-creative. I sent it back and asked for a refund which they did give me. I think I took one bite it was so bad. 

I also had a Bloody Mary which was decent. Even though it came with the standard Bloody Mary toppings, I would have appreciated a bit more (maybe a slice of bacon?). Overall, the actual brewery itself is much better than this restaurant. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went here just to grab a drink with friends. There's not a ton to say - they only serve Capital Brewery beers - which is fine for one night. In general though, I feel the need for more variety. We ended up getting frites, but I was severely disappointed. Smallish portion and you can definitely get better ones elsewhere in Madison.

Environment: Small and dark. Nice decor for a place on State St. Hard to tell if it wanted to be a restaurant or a bar though.
Service: It's a weird place. There are waitresses but it's hard to tell whether you should seat yourself and just order at the bar or not."}
{"text":"My friend and I have stopped in a few times, and enjoyed it the majority of the time. The food is absolutely delicious and the portion sizes are very generous. To start, I had the Polish bites, and moved on to the fish fry and swapped with my friend for the German fried potato. Everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly. My drink of choice is typically a Chocolate lab, but I'm never opposed to trying the other various drinks they offer on the specials menu.

The only gripe I have is that our original wait staff was finishing their shift, and we expected someone to take over helping us. The people left behind the bar pretty much ignored us, but was attentive to everyone else. It was so bad that we had to stop the person behind the bar very loudly, twice, before they stopped to close our tab.

We're not opposed to stopping in again, but we'll definitely be in the seating area rather than taking a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"I think if you're looking for a place to have some fries and a beer with a decent atmosphere then this is the place to go. However, if you're looking for a restaurant then you should probably try somewhere else. 

The menu looks pretty impressive, however, the food that comes out tends to be lukewarm and to be honest it's not anything special. I have been here 4 times now and this has been the case each time. The food is overpriced for what it is - which, like I said, is nothing to write home about and the waitstaff don't really want you to be there."}
{"text":"Had to bring this down to 2 stars. Came back for trivia because of the time convenience.

$3 new glarus taps (only had 2 beers), $4 moscow mules (not very good at all, tastes only like ginger beer), and $9 liter of any tap.

I was very shocked that they only had 1 of their own beers on tap

Didn't have the food, but my friends said that they were decent. The trivia was very hard to hear, either back speakers or the MC doesn't know how to use the mic correctly. 

Layout is always the problem here - it's less of a bar and more of a eating place in my opinion. It's just super long and not too much space between the booths and the bar. TVs are pretty small so I wouldn't recommend coming here to watch an event."}
{"text":"Today Date: 9/29/2012, Time: 12:31:18 PM, Server Name: Lilli, Check Number: 128449
We had the Mussels and Frites, an Annual Tap/Octoberfest and a Tap Haus Bloody Mary. Sat at the bar. Servers inattentive, watching the football game , on TV. Chatting with each other at the other end of the bar. 
See menu:
http://www.capitaltaphaus.com/menu.php

Told the wait staff that the quoted 'One pound of Prince Edward Island mussels' was about a half pound shy. They said the told the cook/ chef....okay and what did he have to say?
 The Frites were good fries... 'Served with a\"Chef sauce\", a combination of half Dark Capital BBQ sauce and half mayonnaise'....a squirt of BBQ sauce in a plastic cup with some mayo, not even mixed.

Average quantity is 20-25 mussels per lb
there were 11 on our plate- 
the MENU stated we were getting 1 LB PEI Mussels...

We missed a half lb somewhere.

{"text":"We gave the Tap Haus it's final try last night after finding our chosen restaurant packed to the gills on a Tuesday evening.  Less than a block away the Capital Tap Haus was ominously empty and we were seated immediately, within sight of the bartender and two waitresses.

With no greeting from a waitstaff, no water brought to the table, and no indication that anyone was interested in taking our order I placed our drink order at the bar.  The bartender questioned whether we had seated ourselves and then took our order.  When the waitress brought our drinks to our table she opened by saying both she and her fellow waitress had thought we were 'Someone else's table'.

Previous visits had similar service experiences (very lackluster) and the food has never been more than marginal.  I'm all for giving a place a second or even third chance but, after our last experience we won't be back.  There are too many wonderful places in Madison to patronize.  Despite the location of the Capital Tap Haus and it's great beers it isn't worth a visit."}
{"text":"Got a burger here. Was one of the more affordable options. Found it to be incredibly bland and average. Not worth the price. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I came here for just some drinks. We sat outside... it was okay but nothing special. The inside was pretty empty except for a few people watching the playoffs. I was a bit disappointed with the beers... I got a flight and did not care for any of them. I guess I was hoping that I'd find something I would love... not here."}
{"text":"Nice outdoor seating.  Very comfortable setting.  Beer selection is from the Capital Brewery.  Good stuff, pretty come though.  I had the Wisconsin Amber and the burger.  
Both were good, beer was better than the burger.  I did really like the pretzel bun though.  
The interior is nice, definitely a place to hang and drink.
I will be back for a brew this weekend."}
{"text":"I've visited Capital Tap Haus a total of about 4 times. In particular, I really enjoyed my last visit. I had a Bloody Mary with their infused vodka which was really good. I find it difficult now a days to find a decent Bloody Mary, but I really enjoyed this one. It was spicy and sweet. Delicious. Highly recommend you try it if you're a Bloody Mary fan. I also ordered the chicken BLT sandwich. I've ordered it twice so far and it keeps me coming back. I order it along with a salad and a side of grilled vegetables. This side usually consists of sauteed spinach and grilled squash and zucchini. Looking forward to enjoying a Bloody Mary out on their patio along with my chicken BLT."}
{"text":"The food here is very average to meh. I had a salmon salad, beer cheese soup, and half a grilled veggie sandwich.

I think I liked the grilled veggie sandwich the best. It was packed with veggies and the toast had the right amount of butter/oil. The salmon salad came in a strange form--all of the lettuce was shredded pretty finely. The salmon was chopped up and thrown on the salad... and it was not very plentiful. The beer cheese soup was overwhelming and way too cheesy (though the flavor of the beer was distinct/good). I could only finish half before giving it to my friend. I guess it doesn't help that I am lactose intolerant.

We also sat at the big booth in the back. It was very awkwardly shaped and made our conversation really hard to hear / be involved in."}
{"text":"Why is this place here?  And in business?  Not good.  Not remotely.  Mediocre, if friendly."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced, poor service, shitty food.  No hockey!  Pathetic excuse for a Wisconsin style bar....somewhere stuck between high end prices and cheap bar food and high priced drinks and crap beer."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and honestly, and it's always been mediocre. And it's a shame, since it's literally a 1 minute walk away from my work. I would love to love this place, as I'd eat here all the time for lunch! But last night, whoa, what a terrible meal.

I ordered their special, which was a Fried Chicken Sandwich, featuring sliced avocado. The fried chicken was overcooked and a little too blackened. The crust was rather flavorless, and I was picking random dried herbs out of my teeth for like an hour. It was everything a piece of fried chicken should NOT be. The avocado was also not ripe. Barely edible, I opted to disassemble my sandwich and eat the chicken with tons of ketchup. And even then, I gave the rest to my companion to finish off. I chose the potatoes as my side, and they were undercooked.

My friend's meal was a $10 bowl of vegetable soup, which he did not really care for. He's the kind of guy who will finish his plate even if the food sucks, and even he struggled. Also, you shouldn't find bay leaves in your soup. Note to kitchen staff, please remove those going forth!

And yes, the beer is overpriced. I luckily ordered a beer that was on special, but my friend was shocked by how much his beers were! Over $7 for a pint?! Hell no.

The bartender who served us had a fun haircut and was pretty nice. Some of the other servers seemed stuck up. And the actual restaurant space is beautiful! The place is decked out with wood, tin ceilings, brick and cool lanterns. It's such a nice space, and it's a shame the dining experience just isn't that good."}
{"text":"Good beer. Sub-par menu and food. Service is usually decent. 

They really need to work on the menu - selection, quality & portion size. This is probably the only place in Madison that I've been to where their cheese curds taste bad. How you can mess up deep fried food, I don't know.

They have a prime location which, incidentally, is only blocks from my house. So, it's really a shame this place isn't better."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoyed our night at the Wisconsin Brewing Tap Haus. Our family came in very hungry, I ordered the \"Vegan stew\" and I was very impressed. Two of my family members had the Reuben and they also enjoyed their meal. The menu could've had a larger variety. The service was very hard working and attentive. Overall we had a great experience."}
{"text":"Went here for a business lunch, so I didn't get a chance to try the taps - but what I did try was excellent. 

Seated right away. Good service, nice atmosphere. I tried the Knockwurst Sandwich and it was amazing! So good, Knockwurst had good flavor, pretzel roll and slaw delicious. Could have used a touch more mustard, but I ate it before I realized. Came with fries  that were a also fantastic. I'm not usually a french fry fan, but yum! 

Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Why didnt I read my past review! I would not have returned only to have super slow service and just ok food.  Note to self - check past reviews."}
{"text":"They really need to rethink their outdoor seating policy of requiring food purchase to sit outside. This policy totally ignores the long term value of the customer. Sitting inside for 15 minutes before we were told to order from the bar. Pretty unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"The food was OK. The beers were OK. The atmosphere was OK. The place was OK. I guess because there are close (better)alternatives like the Great Dane and the Old fashioned I'd give this spot an OK. I would go back and give it another try but only if with a lively bunch to help me through."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would. Thought I would try this restaurant even though reviews were not great as they are tied to local brewery. Plus they were advertising on  Restaurants.com which I have found to be a great way to try new restaurants. Food was ok but when I went to use my coupon I was told that they no longer accept these. Manager would not honor even though I bought months ago and it had not expired.  I indicated I have used Resr.com as a way to try new places to dine and have never been denied the coupon and that was why I tried the restaurant.  He indicated I could get refund from them and he would comp one drink. I told him I didn't have time for another drink and that was BS.  He rescinded the offer and said he didn't need my business and I would pay full price. Which I did never to return..."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Food and beer was good, but were ruined by a waitress trying to hurry us out the door and clear plates and glasses before we were finished. Don't go here if you actually want to be able to enjoy your meal and drinks... there are many many better places to eat and get a good beer around the capital."}
{"text":"(Edited because I thought the original was too harsh):

I can't speak to the food, but I can certainly talk about the beer. Nothing irritates me more than overpaying for bad beer--and that's why I've given them the dreaded \"one star.\"

Service was excellent and the place has a cool layout--nothing wrong with that. I want to issue an apology to Great Dane--your beers are not the worst/mediocre (Dane's were never bad, though) in Madison. I am sincerely sorry.

Capital charged $15 for a boot. I can now say I've had their entire lineup--from the overly-malty IPA to the cardboard-like Amber...this beer is simply not good. And by \"not good\", I mean just plain bad. I have NO idea how Madisonians voted this place for \"Best of Madison\"--I'd much rather have a $6 pitcher of Bud or PBR than the stuff Capital produces.

If you want good, local, well-brewed craft beer, go to Ale Asylum, Karben4, One Barrel, the Great Dane, or Vintage. Do NOT, under any circumstances, spend your money here.

I know it's a bad review, but words cannot describe how bad and overpriced Capital is. Yeah, it's a cool spot, but if you're charging me $5/beer (in Wisconsin)? It better be good. Brewers: I have no idea what you're doing, but when my homebrews come out 100x better than your stuff, I know there's a problem."}
{"text":"The Tap Haus is fine, but only fine. Not great, not horrid, but fine. It's one of the rare places in Madison that give me a very neutral opinion on its existence.

Unless if a certain tap is on special, the beer is usually a bit too expensive there. Some of the taps run for $7 a pint, and considering that they serve a beer that costs $7 at Woodman's for a 6 pack, it certainly seems marked up. I think most of them are decent, a couple aren't so good, and a couple are dang good. But regardless, I think they prices on pints should be lower than they are by a little bit.

As for the food, I think that they have a good selection of appetizers at least. The pretzel is big, and comes on a hook, which is fun. The cheese curds are decent, the fries are decent, and the deep fried vegetables are good. There's a good selection of deep-fried stuff overall. The Sandwiches are just ok though. When I had the veggie sandwich and the grilled cheese, I just felt like it could've added a seasoning or extra ingredient to give it a better flavor. The chopped salads are also just ok. Not really too creative, but the ingredient quality is decent enough.

The space itself is fine too. A lot of seating, big booths, good decor, a decent number of tvs but none that are too large (which can be good or bad depending on the occasion). Overall, everything about the Tap Haus makes it a decent place, but rarely a destination spot. It's probably someplace to keep in mind if you're on the Capitol square and the Old Fashioned or Cooper's are looking too crowded."}
{"text":"Good cheese curds, the BLT with avocado was great, the waffle fries are seasoned & taste great. Great service"}
{"text":"I tried this place out for Restaurant Week.  I thought it would be a great way to get away for a quick, fun lunch.  To tell you the truth, I was a bit disappointed.  Restaurant Week is supposed to be a way to try new restaurants, a variety of their menu items and get a little discount.  

This menu has been going on since Sunday.  It is now Wednesday and the waitress could not answer my basic questions about the menu.  First, I asked what my dipping sauce options were and she named four, mentioning ranch twice.  No big deal.  Then I asked about the temperature of the chocolate cake.  Warm or cold.  Easy question.  I was told warm, she went back twice to find out it was cold.  Little things.  There are only three options for each course, so maybe your servers should know the menu.  

The first course was delicious.  It was small.  There were three cheese fritters. They were delicious but I was upset by the size.  Each course is set for one person but should be the size if the person were ordering an appetizer individually.  This is supposed to be a deal and I feel like I was overcharged.  A full size appetizer is usually $7 (so let's be generous and say this was $5 worth).  

The second course was a flank steak sandwich.  The steak serving was stingy.  A quarter of my sandwich did not have steak on it.  It was oily and at time unappetizing.  This sandwich is normally about $7 (when it comes with a side).  This did not come with a side.  It was a lone sandwich accompanied by two small pickles.  So let's be generous and say it was worth $5.  

The third course was dessert.  I chose New York Cheesecake with berry compote.  It was a beautiful presentation.  However, it was not a full piece of cheesecake.  It was a half piece.  So I paid $15 for this lunch.  $5 for half an appetizer, $5 for a lone sandwich and $5 for half a piece of cheesecake.  I would have been better off ordering a single appetizer to share with my lunch companion.  A full sandwich, that would come with a side and dessert.  

I looked at their menu and calculated all of this and I would have spent the same amount of money for much more food.  That was the worst deal I have ever experienced.  The service was lacking.  If I were you, I would go to Samba and get a better bang for your dollar."}
{"text":"Cute little bar in Mad-town.  Spent the day sight seeing and wanted to grab a snack and a drink before heading back to Manitowoc and we thought we would stop in here to try some local beers.  We ordered a few things...everything we got was great!  The pretzel with beer cheese seriously was the biggest pretzel I have ever seen. I mean, it was obnoxiously huge. We also ordered the Rueben spring rolls. Sounds odd but it was so good!!! And fried pickles...no joke, they literally fried the entire pickle. We're not talking little pickle chips. We're talking the entire pickle spears. Huge. It was good! I enjoyed it.   As for cleanliness, this place can use some work. The tables were a big dirty. Or table was pretty filthy. I had to use my own table napkin to wipe off the table. It had sticky stuff and food all over it. The waitress didn't even offer to wipe it off.  She seemed somewhat clueless. She was so the only one working, behind the bar and as the server.   Other than that though, it was good."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped by here for the first time when the wait was too long at the Old Fashioned. I mean, if you're looking for some pub food, this is a nice choice. The menu isn't large, but there are the classics you need on it. Burgers, fries, grilled cheese, cheese curds, salads, etc. They do make a pretty mean Friday fish fry and the servings are generous. This is a good place to go on hockey game days because it is far enough down State that it isn't too crowded.

The beer is great as always. I've had a few of their seasonals here including the Hop Cream Ale, Capital Dark and Oktoberfest.

Inside the restaurant it can get crowded. During the summer, you can eat outside on State Street. Always a treat!"}
{"text":"UPDATE:  
Well, I didn't want to but I was entertaining and my guest wanted to come here. So I came. Again. And I was disappointed. Again.

This time, the bartender was incredibly attentive--and very nice!

The kicker came when my guest and I each ordered a salad. The bartender asked if we wanted to add chicken or smoked salmon. We both jumped at the smoked salmon. The menu SAYS, \"Add Haus Cured Honey Smoked Norwegian Salmon small $3 / large $4.\"

Now, I'm not sure if the chef at WBTH knows this or not, but canned salmon is definitely NOT smoked salmon. It's not even close.  Canned salmon is something I take for emergencies when I go camping. It is NEVER to be served at a restaurant. FOR SHAME, WISCONSIN BREWING!!  THIS IS SUPER SHITTY. FIX THAT SHIT. NOW.

CANNED SALMON IS NOT SMOKED SALMON, YOU CRETANS.

I started my update with 2 stars (down from the original 3), but now I'm all worked up after writing about that salmon travesty and I'm thinking, NO! Why the hell would I give two stars?  Because 1 star means I'm not coming back. So you get one. And I don't think that's unreasonable for two totally-not-up-to-par evenings that I can never get back.

Your beer is fantastic, by the way. I'll continue to buy it at Woodman's.  Doesn't do a darn thing to help that salmon problem though.

Original review:
Food's pretty good.  Atmosphere is very nice.  Service is okay (not impressive,  and I'm ridiculously easy going about that).
The bathroom made me crazy.  Toilets take forever to fill, so it's still filling from the person before you by the time YOU'RE done, and then you have to stand there and wait like a weirdo to flush. LOL That alone makes me not wanna come back."}
{"text":"We stopped in here after walking around the Farmers Market and scored two seats at the bar. I ordered their seasonal pumpkin beer and it was SOOO good. It had such a great taste of pumpkin! My fiance tried two of the IPA's and he liked both. We ordered the Cheese Curds - because we had to, and those were great. Nice little spot downtown to stop off and have a beer and a snack!"}
{"text":"My vegan stew was good.
Root beer was good.
Service was good.
Prices were good.
Location was good.

Nothing spectacular, but getting all the above right definitely deserves 4 stars."}
{"text":"Try the double bock beer!

Friendly Staff, nice location. We didn't eat, but the food smelled good!"}
{"text":"Patrick the Monday night bartender set us up with some delicious Mutiny IPA's. It tasted great to me. Didn't try the food but I see a lot of people complaining about it... I find that a little odd. This doesn't seem like the kind of place you go to for the food. 

The trivia was fun and they have a big jug of vodka with various veggies floating in it that Patrick said he made bloody Mary's with."}
{"text":"My significant other loved it because he's a giant Capital Brewery junkie and I could not be less impressed. There's a lot better offerings on State St, I'll say that; but if you love Capital Brewery, this is the place.

My beef with this place is that the menus are wonky: the food offerings are slim-pickings and kind of awkward choices. It's like it wants to be taken seriously as a restaurant, but really only caters to it's pub-clientele and straddles a really weird fence.

The menu offers pairings for dishes to go with its beer, which is nice and all, but I'm not a huge beer drinker. They don't put any alternative beverages on their menus so it's kind of irritating. (Though, they do have a wine and liquor list, if I recall correctly.) I wound up getting their root beer, but I wasn't aware that they'd charge you for every additional refill because it's their own blend--which, again, isn't on their menu. Ugh.

They do offer samplings of their beers, though, which is kind of nice, I guess.

I wound-up getting the Argentinian flank steak and frites. It was all right; the pesto was probably the best I've ever had in my life, but everything else was \"meh,\" at best. It's a sign of weakness in taste when a customer has to ask for A1 Steak Sauce to have flavor with their meat.

My partner loved his chicken spiedis or whatever the hell it's called, but admitted there was a lack of flavoring there too in which neither of the two mustard offerings on the table (no ketchup, for you tomato-lovers) really helped to salvage.

When this place gets its very basic menu issues sorted out, I'd be more OK with coming back here."}
{"text":"The Capital Tap Haus is an average burger place with a limited selection of beer. They only serve Capital Brewery beers which is just okay. The food is nothing special and I would try other places around the square before I stopped back here."}
{"text":"Strange space.  Small  menu.  The burger was good but the \"bread dumplings\", I think they were called left a whole lot to be desired.  The space is so cramped I can't believe the waistaff put up with it."}
{"text":"I hit up the Capital Tap Haus a couple weeks ago on a particularly frigid evening, and it was just the place to warm me up. I love the interior, they did a great job transforming the cheese shop that was previously there. Cozy booths, warm lighting, and an extremely welcoming bartender (proprietor?) made for a great stop. We were too late for food, but they've got fried pickles so I assume they're doing it right."}
{"text":"Adorable pub on a quaint, bohemian touristy street. The beers were pretty good, a nice selection. The IPA was a standard, the chocolate beer was as expected. They offered very good Manhattans for $5!! The food was okay, regular pub food. The only thing that stood out at this joint was the dreadful service."}
{"text":"Great Food and a view of the capital if it is nice and you can eat outside. Check out the Hooked app, they have great deals especially for lunch on there all the time.. I mean a seriously awesome deal. 
Beer and a burger or sandwich is what you are going to get, but it is a nice place and you can expect the beer and burger to be good ones. There is even a small selection for a breakfast menu."}
{"text":"we wound up here last night after finding 40+ minute wait times at every dining establishment on the square. the host said 10-15 and we were starving, so we got beers and waited. 

I am not a fan of capital beers, but decided to try a dark anyway... and it was a letdown, just like every other capital brewery beer I've had. I will never understand why people love these mediocre beers so much, but I digress.

we were seated and our waitress was great- fast and friendly, and the only reason this review is getting two stars instead of one. we ordered some cheese curds to share and they looked normal, but tasted burned. and my blue cheese burger, the one that sounded so delicious on the menu? the pretzel roll was burned, and the burger itself was devoid of flavor. 

as if all that weren't bad enough, they were playing some awful new country the entire time. yuck.

if you aren't picky about your beer, food or music, this might be your place."}
{"text":"This place has quietly earned a solid reputation as a bar-restaurant which attempts to fulfill all patrons' needs.  While the competition among the restaurants on the other side of State St. has resulted in something of an escalating price war, this place seems to hold it's value.  The wide array of Capital beer choices are paired with a menu which includes a variety of the \"usual suspects\" including sandwiches, salads and entrees.  While it's compact size may be a little claustrophobic for some, the staff are generally helpful and engaging.  The few times I have been in, I chose to sit at the bar and received prompt service."}
{"text":"Awesome outdoor seating along State Street (on the end closer to the capital bldg)

Great Pilsner that they brew right there.

Accept credit cards.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Came on a Thursday night for trivia. The pretzels and bratwurst dinner were very good. $4 Moscow mules!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with the family for a break after walking around downtown.  Ordered three appetizers, pretzel with beer cheese, cheese curds and fries in a garlic aioli.  The fries were the favorite of the family.  Good fresh hot fries with a dipping sauce that was a little overly sweet but still good.  Cheese curds we good but were starting to fall apart as they seemed to be left in the fryer and little too long.  Pretzel was ok.  Was barely warm and seemed a little old.  Appeared not to be made there.  The beer cheese dipping sauce was good but a little thin. The bartender served us.  She was prompt when we sat down and served us our drinks.  Then drifted over to the two waitresses sitting at the bar and came back when we motioned for her.  Poor service like that bothers me.  Your a college student working in a bar for tips.  Be a little outgoing.
Three appetizers, four Miller lites and two cokes were 37 and change."}
{"text":"A solid and satisfying lunch on the patio. Though nothing was a standout, my bloody mary and grilled veggie sandwich were tasty nonetheless. The staff was friendly and helpful but hands-off enough for me to enjoy the beautiful September day and do some people watching."}
{"text":"Good beer. Nice bar. Service was horrible.  Bartender acted like we were bothering her by being here. Won't go back when she's here"}
{"text":"It was wonderful food, at a great price and with wonderful service.  They had a great selection on the menu and it was conveniently located about a block from the Capitol."}
{"text":"Our server was very slow, and really had no understanding of general drinks, items on their menu, or spirits in general. I was charged $2.50 for ice in my amaretto yet we had 4 large ice waters for no charge. Those who drank he beer said it was t very good either."}
{"text":"I was craving a burger on my walk up to the Capitol, so I figured I would try this place out since it has been around for a while now and had, presumably, ironed out any wrinkles.

The atmosphere is very nice, plenty of TV's if you want to watch sports (no subtitles were on though) and it really feels like a comfortable place to hang out.  The place was relatively empty when I was in, but it was only 6:30pm when I walked in the door.

I sat myself at the bar and was promptly greeted by the bartender.  She brought me the menus that I asked for, explained what was on tap, and as soon as I heard \"Hop Cream\" I knew what I was drinking.

The beer also arrived quickly, which was nice seeing as the place wasn't busy.  Some places seem to lag when it's slow and when it's packed, but this place was great so far.

I ordered the Tap Haus Burger with Gorgonzola and I asked to add pub chips to my order.  Now, the burger is $6.75 on its own, but the menu says that it is served with a salad.  I added Gorgonzola for $1 more.  $3 to add pub chips

The food didn't take long, but I was surprised that instead of \"adding\" pub chips to my order, the pub chips took the place of the salad.  There was some pitiful coleslaw thrown on there, and maybe that's their salad for the sandwiches...but I hope not.  Anyway, I was surprised that for $2 less than an actual side order, I basically lost my side salad with my burger and got less chips and no garlic aioli.  In other words, what showed up on my plate was not worth the $10.25 I paid for it.

The burger itself was well cooked, medium-well even though I wasn't asked how I wanted my burger cooked.  The meat was well seasoned as well.  A lot of places miss that part for some reason.  The garnish (lettuce, red onion, tomato) was ok, but it seemed like they took the time to painstakingly cut it all as thin as possible so that they could make their onions and tomatoes go further.  Granted, I'm sure it's a deli slicer because their pub chips are just as (paper) thin.  In any case, they were present on the burger but didn't really show up on the palate other than the onion.  They might do better with a lightly pickled red onion because uncooked red onions basically dominate everything on the plate when you eat it.  Speaking of pickles, there was a pickle spear and it was standard as pickles go.  The pretzel bun was good, though once you actually grab your burger the bun basically compresses to the thickness of a dime.  There is integrity to the bun though, so that's a plus I guess.  I didn't taste anything pretzel-like, but it looked like a pretzel bun with the very dark and glossy shell.  If they could give it a hard roll sort of texture and throw on a couple pieces of salt...it would be more of a pretzel I think.  

The pub chips are ok, but they are too thin to fit what I think of as 'pub' anything.  I know I'm being picky, but I was thinking of something thicker than what I got.  Seeing as I paid $3 for the small handful of these thin-cut fries...there may be some bitterness tainting my review here.  Actually, I think a lot of it could have been avoided had I been given the garlic aioli that comes with the pub chips regularly and, as I assumed, when you ADD them to your order (not SUB).  Even my receipt said I added the pub chips, not substituted them.

The coleslaw was a lame throwaway on the plate.  It serves no real purpose other than to be a bland garnish, which it was.  So, if that's what they're going for...mission accomplished.  I ate it because I was pretty hungry.

The Hop Cream was ok.  Not very creamy for a cream ale though.  Not very hoppy either, but that may just be the recipe they're going for.  If you like really creamy cream ales or hoppy ales, don't get this one.  If you want something that won't assault your palate like a lot of hoppy beers will...then this is your beer.  It was a lot like bubblegum though; good when I was drinking it, but I won't remember it (or order it again).  The pint was $4.25, which is pretty normal as pints go.

Total for a burger, a few chips and a pint: $15.31  *ouch*  I regularly tip 20% and the bartender deserved it seeing as most of her checks were not customers so much as people who work at the bar (she said it, I overheard it).  Anyway, all told I was $18.31 in the hole after a semi-satiating meal that left me wanting more in a lot of ways.  

Moral of the story? Don't get a burger & fries.  You're going to pay just about the same for most entrees and, based on what I read anyway, you're probably going to get more bang for your buck.  I did think it was cool that they had a roasted 1/2 duck on special, but $18.99 is a bit steep seeing as it's coming out of a pub kitchen.  I should also say that they use Hereford beef which is a very nice touch.

I couldn't tell if they use anything local.  If they do, they should mention it on the menu.  You can get better food for the same price or a tad more up on the square.  I might go back"}
{"text":"Just stopped by while waiting for a reservation at a different restaurant and was pleasantly surprised! I thought the interior design was really cool and it would be a nice place to sit and be cozy with friends. Service was very fast and friendly and our waitress was happy to pack our cheese curds and fries to go when we had to leave early. There was nothing spectacular about the food but also nothing disappointing either - overall a decently solid place to pop in to. They were out of their Nectarine Beer, but the waitress suggested the Sunset Bruise which was really quite lovely - light, fruity, and perfect to drink and pair with cheese curds. Would highly recommend trying this brew if you try this place out. Thanks for a good time!"}
{"text":"This place has an alright vibe although if you are searching for a restaurant with amazing food look elsewhere. The beer is exclusively from Capital brewery in Middleton WI. If you think their beer is interesting and good you will like this bar. I happen to think their beer is boring and uninspired. I would say this place is worth checking out but not a return destination."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an excellent diner here. We came in for the Friday night fish fry and it was impressive! We also really enjoyed the atmosphere and historical feel of the building. We had an event to go to downtown afterward and it was an excellent location to make that walk."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now. The service has always been quick & friendly and they have some really tasty dishes. Our favorites include the reuben rolls, harvester sandwich, and fish fry! 

Capital Tap Haus is a nice step up from bar food for a casual night out!"}
{"text":"I had a coupon for 10 dollars off a bill of 25 dollars or more that I had to use before the end of the year.  I had never been here before and of course they were about to change to the Wisconsin Brewing Co Tap Haus the following week.  so everything was taken with a grain of salt.

My brother ordered the special sandwich of the day.  It was a fried chicken sandwich, bacon, ranch, and lettuce/tomato/onion but he only had the chicken, bacon, and bun.  He thought it was okay.  I ordered the BBQ Brisket sandwich.  It was tasty.  Our server was friendly and attentive but we were the only ones there for almost 40 minutes, so I assume it was as much as good service as trying not to be bored.

But the real reason you go to a Tap Haus is for the beer.  But when you go to a business that is switching from Capitol Brewery to Wisconsin Brewing Company beers, the taps are not replaced when they run out.  I ending up getting the Amber and brother got the Pumpkinatur.  He liked his beer a lot.  I think the Capitol Amber is a good solid beer but I was really hoping to try something new.  

So to the first and last visit to the Capital Tap Haus, it was a solid choice but not a Coopers or Great Dane.  It will be nice to see how it adjusts to the Wisconsin Brewing Co beers and menu changes.  I will probably check it out in the spring some time."}
{"text":"Wow. I have been meaning to go to this place for ever and I am kicking myself for not going sooner. They have great lunch specials and happy hours on beer. They have an impressive line up with super friendly staff. 

I was literally in awe when we sat down. I was facing a picturesque state street/Capitol view. My jaw dropped even further when my burger came out, but still not far enough to fit the mammoth in my mouth!  Despite my full stomachs cries I ate that hole sandwich and needed another beer to wash it down. As if the food, drinks, and great service wasn't enough, when the bill came out and we had used out deal on the hooked up, we made it out of there for under $12!! It's definitely a place I will be going back to."}
{"text":"March 2018.: What is going on in this place?  No longer have their beer on tap for weeks?  Insects flying around the bar and our drinks?  Super slow service? Grungy paper tap lists?  Something is amiss. 

Summer 2017:  The frites are now waffle fries--that's like Arby's. And worst of all, the rent-a-cops with guns patrolling the outdoor area?  No thanks!  No guns needed during my small plate!"}
{"text":"I know this might cause a huge war but I'm just going to throw this out there... \"This place has the best cheese curds in Madison, period!\" If you forget to order them, just do yourself a favor and immediately return to the restaurant and demand you get a serving of the delicate morsels.

They certainly have an advantage as they have the best beer batter mix AND they are an extension of the Capital Brewery in Middleton. Which for a previous yelper to complain why they don't have any other beer brands is beyond me. Why would you WANT anything else??? Capital Brews rock!!

Their simple menu does them well, as they can execute it well. The sandwiches come with a standard side salad and a much more healthy choice after needing a triple bypass with their curds.

Capital Tap Haus, don't you go changing a thing!"}
{"text":"great spot near the capital, with cozy outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Food ranges from average to mediocre, although I like the pulled pork sandwich. Wash it down with a beer flight or a boot. I mainly go out of convenience (it's located right by the Square) - and for the trivia, which is great when you can actually get a table. If you get there after 8:00 on a Monday or Thursday, be prepared to stand."}
{"text":"We stopped here during a mini impromptu bar crawl that my bf and I went on last Sunday in Madison. This was newly built since we were last here so we decided to check it out. The decor is ok but pretty standard. I had their speciality bloody Mary which was infused with garlic, peppers, and onions. I am a sucker for infused vodkas but this one was a little overpowering with the garlic. I would give this place another shot and try out the food next time."}
{"text":"Two words: Reuben Rolls!!!  They are amazing and I would recommended them as a started for anyone who is a fan of Reuben sandwiches, egg rolls, or deep fried deliciousness. 

For my entree I had the Californian salad with salmon. It was good, but I'm not dying to go back and get it again. The beer is from Capital Brewery, which I like, so I did a beer flight to try a few different taps. 

Overall a good experience, and we'll go again if we're in the area, but we won't be making a special trip."}
{"text":"A nah. Overly priced for such low quality food. Nuff said."}
{"text":"When I go to Madison's Capital area, I tend to prefer dive bars, but this brew-pub featuring the beers of Capital Brewing is worth a visit. The food was your typical pub grub, with a little more flair when it comes to the specials, and an ample selection of local food options as well. All in all, for a strip where there are not a lot of great choices, this is a place for the beer lover to go try some brews. 

The servers are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very laid back which I personally enjoy. The hostess was really cool and asked if we were going to the concert that night at the Orpheum which we were. I automatically love a place where the employees are down to earth and make genuine little connections with their customers. I got the Reuben sandwich which I thought was delicious but I just recently discovered Reuben sandwiches so I'm probably not the best judge ever. I got greens as the side which I was pleasantly surprised by. It was expecting gross iceberg lettuce or something  and it was definitely better than that. The beer was actually really good! I'm from Michigan which is notoriously huge for craft beer so I'm always curious what other states have to offer. I forgot the name of the beer I ordered but it was an IPA that was about 7% ABV and 60 IBU and it was super good. I would choose that beer over some of my go-to Michigan beers without a doubt. This was the perfect place to grab food and drinks before a show at the Orpheum."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere here and comfortable stools. I liked the beer description menus as I'm not a gambler when it comes to trying beer.  Their names were fun, Chocolate Lab happens to be my new favorite beer name.

I was here on a weeknight meeting a friend before a show at The Overture.  There were only a few other people in the bar, so I couldn't even stare at their food to give you a better idea of how that was.  The menu was typical: sandwiches, apps, but I do admit I was intrigued to try their every day fish fry, because as a Wisconsinite I do love the occasional fried fish.  However, we didn't give ourselves enough time to order and eat.  Perhaps another time."}
