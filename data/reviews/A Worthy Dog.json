{"text":"Went today they were at old town public house. Got the chili dog and a polish sausage. The chili dog was good not great, but the polish sausage was very good. The bun they used for it was incredible, really put it over the top. Talked to the owner and said he gets them fresh everyday. Would go again and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Awesome couple who has a hot dog and sausage stand and truck. We had them at Birdsong Brewery and they were delicious. Every order is made to order. I had the jalapeno stuffed jumbo beef, and it was delicious!  My husband and his friend got jalapeno dogs with cheese (real shredded cheese!) and they were awesome too!"}
{"text":"So work is having this hobby-day thing and there's cars and quilts and crafts and a hot dog stand! Yea! Somebody's hobby is food! Well, turns out it's their job actually, and they do OK for serving a parade of people looking for a free lunch. Cooler of sodas, table of chips, choice of beef, turkey, veggie or a polish that could have used a few more minutes on the grill - hot enough but not charred. Onion, relish, peppers, kraut, chili, or cheese, but no cilantro?! Oh my..."}
{"text":"This is a great hot dog trailer! I visited this establishment on Sunday at D9 Brewer, and I have to admit that I don't really eat hot dogs, but they have veggie hot dogs! This is a husband and  wife team, and they are very kind and we're helpful with the different hot dogs and toppings. I chose the veggie dog with chili, cheese and jalapeno's and it was absolutely delicious! The prices range from $4.00 - _$7.00 and potato chips are included. I highly recommend \"A Worthy Dog\" to young and old alike! Keep up the great work Worthy Dog! You are representing small businesses well!!!"}
