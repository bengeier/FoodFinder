{"text":"Really good pizza  The deep dish reminds me of Round Table  I ordered the  chicken alfredo pizza  A medium will feed 2 very well  Hope this place sticks around !"}
{"text":"Food was good the wait wasn't long for pick up on a Saturday night. Service was great over the phone and in person. I believe the girls name was Kim. The only thing is they forgot to give us our sodas. But can't knock them for that. I would def return and I am not from Vegas."}
{"text":"there subs are super plain , one of the workers had her daughter running in and out the place like it was a day care ...i asked for no ranch with the sub they still gave it to me with ranch"}
{"text":"Very good and clean really enjoyed eating there we will definitely be going back they have the best ravioli in town and there big not small"}
{"text":"Got some food from this place for the first time, overall the pizza was good. I got a large pizza, and bread sticks for $28. The price is about average from most places I ordered from, but you get a lot of food for the price. The only complaint I have is that I ordered a deep dish, but it didn't really seem like a deep dish you would get from Chicago, but was good overall. I would probably recommend the stuffed crust if you were looking for something more to the pizza."}
{"text":"I tried this place out and I will never go back again  . Customer service is horrible . The calzone was so skinny  I ordered a pepperoni with mushroom and extra mozzarella cheese calzone , I got a skinny calzone with cottage cheese no pepperoni and a few mushrooms not worth $19 dollars if I could give it 0 stars I will . Save your money ."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot last night. I ordered a large pizza and some garlic bread with cheese. The garlic bread was tasty but at $6 for two Texas toast sized slices seemed a bit expensive. I ordered the deep dish pizza and was so impressed with it. Really enjoyed the crispy crust, great cheese, decent amount of toppings. Service was good on arrival for my pickup. There are still a lot of things on the menu I am curious about trying. Based on the pizza I had, I will definitely be going back. And I'll also be trying some other menu items."}
{"text":"No!!!!!  I loved this place!  Sadly they closed down.  I'm glad I got a chance to eat it for the last time just two days ago."}
{"text":"Came in when they offered half off for all online orders as part of a promotion- join their email club and find them on social media to be updated with this info, as it seems to happen fairly often. The food itself was good, and the discount made it even better.   FOOD The pizza is the highlight, available in thin crust and Chicago deep dish style, which is similar to Pizza Hut's pan pizza rather than Giordano's. Crispy, thick, buttery crust was great. The 9\" medium is enough for two to share if you add on an app.  They offer several (9?) signature pies, the Parmigiana is their take on Eggplant Parm with sliced roasted eggplant and tomato. Great choice.  Wings are nicely meaty, app portion is ample for the price (9 wings for $8). No flavors available to specify for sauce, bleu cheese or ranch dip available prepackaged. Salads are available in half and full sizes, few different varieties, fresh produce in a decent sized portion. Prepackaged dressings.   SERVICE The staff are friendly, the online ordering system is easy to use, and my pickup order was ready within 5 minutes of the scheduled time. There is counter service only, majority of business seems to be takeout and delivery. The guys were nice, but out of three items ordered only one was received correctly. Pizza was supposed to be half and half, wings were supposed to be hot with bleu cheese (received mild with ranch)."}
{"text":"The newest pizza joint on my side of town. Why not give them a try. I ordered a deep dish pizza with my fave toppings. Honestly, it was pretty good. Chewy, buttery crust with decent sauce and toppings. I went with the 12 inch pizza, which was plenty for me."}
{"text":"Having just completed installing a new water main at a retired firefighters home in Las Vegas, I was hungry for a good meal and logged into Wi-Fi at Pizza 9 (Great Chicago style pizza! Especially the deep dish, crusty Hawaiian is just Excellent).  While reflecting on a good job well done to stop wasting water and money $350, 2,500-3,000 GALLONS of WATER/month.. . I decided to post it up to mark the date(:))).. . I'm a 4th generation MasterPlumber and proud to be of service, especially saving water. Alright, just in time, here's my pizza. \"Thank you, Ralph. I'll write about it. I just love the food and hospitality here. Friendly, clean, relaxing and good. Great all the way around. Thanks, for being here. @ReviewBumDB"}
{"text":"I  tried the chicken Alfredo pizza, It was great/great service, I will come back for more Keep up the good work, thank you so much"}
{"text":"This place is severely underrated. SEVERELY!!!! My son wanted pizza and we saw on the news they had a grand opening. So we went a few days later. The place is clean and the staff is friendly. I notice they wash their hands before touching your food which is a plus. KEEP IT UP STAFF BECAUSE WE DO LOOK FOR THINGS LIKE THIS. We ordered the Italian sausage with onion and as we were waiting another female came in and we heard her order and say \"I want the Chicago Beef like I had the other day\". Then I asked her \"is it that good that you are back a few days apart\"....She said \"Oh my goodness, you should try it!!!\". I then felt like I ordered the wrong thing but when our pizza came to the table I was totally satisfied. This place has some of the best pizza crust that I have tasted in a while. This is not soggy pizza by far. However, a week later me and my son was in the area because I had a doctor appointment and he normally goes with me when he is out of school and we stopped by and ordered that Chicago Beef. We mixed it with with the Italian sausage and onion and man on man. What a pizza!!! I told the manager who is a female, you have to get out and advertise. Even if you have to stand on the corner and give out free samples. Vegas has a thousand + pizza restaurants and in order to survive as a pizza business here you have to go to the people. Meaning, go set up a booth at a high school football / basketball game; get a booth at a busy gas station where traffic is thick and let people sample your pizza. Again, great affordable pizza, but you got to do better with advertising. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Had pizza 9 for the 1st time today.  order the wings, ask for them to be cooked hard.  they were those pre-cooked wings- with no taste, and under cooked.  the fries were the same undercook.  the thing about it, the meal was free and i still will not return.  please step your game up with the wings, and maybe find a smaller container for the fries."}
{"text":"My mom had a really rough day today, usually pizza 9 is on point with great food and great service. However, I do believe this will be the last time we go to pizza 9. She ordered a tiramisu for dessert. About half way through my moms dessert (which she never usually gets) she keeps saying this tastes funny, well she notices that there is writing on the bottom and flips it over to see an expiration date of 3/25... today is 3/31. Dairy and eggs are not something you mess around with. Irate I call pizza 9 because this is dangerous for people's health. They inform me that they \"check\" their products daily. This item expired 6 days ago, so I asked if she was telling me that for 6 days they missed the expiration on this item?!?  Usually I'm try to be more calm, but I almost died from ecoli when I was 7, food born illnesses are something i don't play around with.  Sorry pizza 9 while you were my #1 pizza joint for a while we will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is a new pizza joint that opened up in my neighborhood in December 2016 we went here for lunch and it was fantastic. the place is much nicer inside then I thought it would be, they did a great job with it. there have been several restaurants that have come and gone in this strip mall and I hope Pizza 9 really sticks and gets a following because they have earned it. the quality of the food was excellent, the employees were very attentive and asked me several times if I needed anything, service was a smile is always appreciated.  I ordered a medium pepperoni deep dish pizza and a****** long it would take the cashier said 12 minutes and sure enough 12 minutes later the pizza arrived at my table very quickly I also tried the garlic cheese bread and that was excellent, I would highly recommend pizza9 you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas! The staff is friendly and their deep dish pizza is excellent. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Great quality pizza. The staff was super friendly and they remembered my name. Their prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was great. If you are looking for some yummy pizza you have made the right choice."}
{"text":"Best franchise pizza in Vegas. Whether it's the meatball with green chili on deep dish, veggie delight on thin or the Lobo pizza roll it's always crisp, light, and flavorful. Never soggy, undercooked or skimpy on the toppings. My husband really like the chicken and artichoke soup. It's a family-owned franchise location that hails from my home-state of NM and it beats Pizza Huts, Papa Johns, Dominos, Metro Pizza, and Little Ceasar's for traditional and Chicago style pizza 9 out of 10 times not to mention that it's the only place you can get Hatch green chili on your pizza! They are consistent and they are consistently improving."}
{"text":"This most definitely the best pizza in all of Vegas.. Went in last night I usually go there a few times a month.. There deep dish is amazing. Customer service was excellent. They have a few classic arcade games to play. Very cool.. I ordered a large deep dish.. Always cooked just the way i like it.   The prices are very affordable and the food get ready quickly. I can always count on this place to deliver."}
{"text":"I recommend the the meatball and hatch green chili on thin crust... it's fantastic!!    The place is clean, staff is friendly,  bathrooms are tidy.   Good family place.  Prices are reasonable.   I have been here many times and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Used a coupon. I'm used to Jersey pizza. If you like Pizza Hut, this place is for you!  The guy working there was very nice!"}
{"text":"Flame   Best pizza in town. Calzones on point, Chicago beef taste authentic, my favorite are the hot wings with ranch, they also deliver which is very convenient."}
{"text":"buffalo sauce and dipping sauce tasted great. the chicken was a little undercooked. the boneless wings were soggy. the delivery driver got lost. i like the plastic containers they put the wings in. thats it"}
{"text":"I don't live in this area anymore (SAD FACE) but I do frequent most of the businesses still.  I saw an ad on the news about this place and decided to check it out.  When we walked in it was super clean! And we were greeted right away! (A++) It took a minute to finally order.  We ordered a deep dish with ground beef and bacon (yumms).  There were no other customers in the restaurant (which is weird for a Friday night...?) But overall, it was cool."}
{"text":"Just tried this new pizza place... I thought the pizza was pretty decent. Definitely going back and getting more pizza soon. Love the coupon deals they have!"}
{"text":"Great food and the deep dish is on point!  It's hard to find \"Chicago-Style\" in this town but Pizza Nine really came close. Chewy, thick and butter crust with quality toppings.   Also, try the tiramisu. Real good!"}
{"text":"So far, i had been very dissapointed with most of the \"best\" pizza places we have visited here in Vegas. I thoroughly understand and respect  that we all have VERY different opinions of what \"great\" pizza should taste like. From the dough type, sauce ingredients to the amount of cheese it should have. Thin crust, deep dish, square vs round, etc. But i think we can all agree that flavor, quality of ingredients and the proper combination of them is crutial to execute a great tasting pizza. Well i think this place met most expectations when it comes to their pizza. We ordered 2 medium pizzas, first one basic pepperoni and cheese. Second one Hawaiian style. The crust was amazing! Crispy at the edges yet soft and doughy. It  had the right balance of sauce and cheese, as well as toppings. The pepperoni was specially  tasty. My family ate the entire pizza and they all commented on how much they liked it. This was a pick-up order and the pizza arrived hot and steamy. The size of the pizza did not dissapoint either. This was the first time we have ordered from here and considering some of the reviews on this restaurant, I am not sure if we got lucky with our order, if the service and quality has in fact improved recently based on the reviews or if it had been a long time since we had bought pizza from any restaurant around here, but our experience was so satisfying, that we will definately order from this place again."}
{"text":"Ordered with UberEat, pizza arrived after 40 minutes which is reasonable however arrived cold , no way we order again. PS- pizza didn't even taste to standard !!"}
