{"text":"We love Slicers! I was in a pinch ordering food for 35 people and they  were on it like that!  They really hustled to help us out!  Thank you so much you guys!  I've never seen our staff more happy!  Oh and consistently good food!"}
{"text":"I have been back to Slicers 2 times since my initial review and each time the food & service has been great! And the brownies are superb!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast burritos! They always get my order right, never takes too long and they treat their customers good."}
{"text":"Great food. $$ and I think they should let you change the side when you choose a combo. They give you coleslaw only and you have to pay extra if you want to change it for macaroni salad or chips, and I have two kids that doesn't really like coleslaw. But besides that, it's a nice place, super clean, friendly staff and fast. I will recommend."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sandwiches! I highly recommend the Clam Chowder and Grilled Cheese! The staff always has a smile and makes you feel at home! If you haven't tried NY Slicers... you must!!!! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came back again today because I enjoyed it so much the first time. Once again, best service. The ladies were s nice. The food was once again awesome! I got the Chipotle Chicken Sandwich and I think it was even better than the Cali Slicer. Fresh, juicy chicken, fresh veggies and a yummy soft bun. It has this awesome smoky chipotle flavor that completes the sandwich. I will definitely get this one again. I stopped in the middle of eating it just to write this review."}
{"text":"Awesome place!, it was really great food and they had a very fun and friendly staff!

I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family or anyone that wants a true New York style deli sandwich!"}
{"text":"Staff is so nice :) place is clean. the food was delicious,i got the New York Rachel. recommending to everyone :)"}
{"text":"This place is bomb. My coworkers and I have been going here for awhile now and haven't had any disappointments. Great variety to the menu, friendly service and the food comes out quickly. Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to try a great deli sandwich! Only down side is they call me Alex #2"}
{"text":"Not only are they some of the best sandwiches I have had, but the customer service is second to none. I'm not sure what that one ladies problem is, but last time i checked this is the 21st century. Faxing in an order is about as up to date as sending it pony express. I wish more ladies had \"daddies that bought them a business\" because they make an excellent product along with excellent service. When you're the only person giving them a one star and everyone else is giving them 3-5 stars, then it's obvious that you're the problem, not them. Congratulations on being the typical nightmare customer."}
{"text":"So a coworker of mine told me about this deli.  He said they were so good that he always buys two.  So I had to come and try for myself.  This is a new york style deli and as soon as you walk in you feel it.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I love it when you walk into an establishment and they greet you with a smile, that for some reason seems to be so rare these days.   I ordered the black and white club and it was amazing!  Plenty of meat and bacon.  Flavor was great.  They use Boars Head meat, finally someone doing it right.   I will most definitely be going back and eager to try the rest of their menu.  Thank you Slicers staff for a sandwich well done.  #subwaywho?
Also if you are a trucker like myself plenty of room to park between the Arco and the deli."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a quick bite and came across this gem. I didn't even realize they had one of these in AZ because I've been to the one in Southern CA. I had a hot pastrami and Swiss! The bread was perfect as was the sandwich. I'll definitely be back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"They've got it! The BEST chicken salad sandwich AND great customer service. Lots of other delicious sandwiches too, very creative flavors, and they make yours just the way you want it. Did you know they cater?!  Our office has already memorized the phone number. 602-442-8000."}
{"text":"The food here is great! I had a chipotle chicken sandwich and it was completely delicious, the sauce was nice and spicy and the avocado was perfect. We also shared some cheesy fries and a gigantic brownie which were both great. Check it out"}
{"text":"Very good food. Had the Reuben, which is the sandwich I judge all others by and it was delicious. Nice to find a place like this in this type of area. Very friendly staff and clean space. The one thing I would suggest would be changing the condiments from single serve to dispensers. Those little packets of ketchup and mustard are awful."}
{"text":"Just came off a girls volleyball tournament and daughters were extremely hungry.  Found this place which has been open 3 months.  I had one of the best pastrami sandwiches EVER!  besides the great food, the people who worked there were exceptionally nice.  Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Omg!!! These sandwiches are the best sandwiches that I have ever had and I am originally from nyc and I know a good sandwich!  The employees are so friendly and nice! Highly recommend this place for anyone that once a good sandwich!"}
{"text":"Food is great but service definitely has to impove, first time I let it go because it was busy but second time I went in and business was slow and my order still took forever and that was with calling ahead. Sandwiches are excellent and the fries too when they have them."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Slicers. I tried the NY Rachel, essentially a hot pastrami sandwich on rye. While the sandwich tasted good, the bread couldn't hold up to all of the fixings and dressing. The macaroni salad was not good. It was very bland and typical of a commercial macaroni salad."}
{"text":"First time here, the food was delicious and the service was super friendly. I had the Rueben and my gf had the chipotle chicken, both great choices. I'll be back to this place for sure. Susu took our orders and she gave us excellent recommendations. Try this place!"}
{"text":"My pastrami taste fantastic! Would have gotten 5 stars but the quantity for the price you pay isn't worth it! But again it was so delicious I'll pay it again! Heads up!!!! Phone your Order in advance place is always busy! ALSO  2 registers would be perfect for this place one for pick up orders and one for Dine in orders!"}
{"text":"So when I go to a lunch joint, I need 2 things....reasonably priced, good quality product AND great service!  NY Slicers delivers on both.  Fresh Boars Head products. I got a corned beef sandwich with slaw!  The rye bread was slightly toasted which added a great texture. 

Now to the service....OUTSTANDING. The owner was so friendly that I liked my food before I even had a bite. She called the regulars by name and seemed like she really loved being there. What a great attitude!

I left the deli feeling better about life in general! 

Keep it up."}
{"text":"I had the rueben it was incredible. I also ordered the triple threat which was also great. Perfect NY stle deli at the right price! Ill definitely return."}
{"text":"The food was really good. I wish there was more coleslaw. The service was okay. And the establishment cleanliness could have been better."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, & great employees!!! Highly recommend to all! They take orders online for quick & easy pickup."}
{"text":"This is my third trip here and every single time I've had to see the dude who ordered after me, get their food first. It's really annoying and won't be coming to this place anymore."}
{"text":"I work nearby and have been eating there for about two months or so, sometimes twice a day. LOL
The owners, who are sisters (I recently found out) are AMAZING! I forgot where they're from, but not from Mexico *contrary to what Mr. J. Jackson thinks lol*. The food's pretty good, too! I usually order the Rachel, Pastrami, or the Grilled cheese. Their morning slicer (I get it with bacon instead) helps me survive emotionally disturbing situations & confrontations. LOL! The amazing, friendly sisters will give you the best customer service I've experienced since driving through that country called Texas. LOL When I finally drive back home, I'm pretty sure having the pleasure of meeting them will probably be the best, positive experience I've had being in Arizona!"}
{"text":"The New York slice is the real thing I had the New York Rachel it was great I have some of the Italian subs are they were also great"}
{"text":"Not only do they have the BEST turkey and pastrami sandwiches for lunch but also make the tastiest grilled cheese sandwich i everrrr had for breakfast oh n the garlic chips they make is just heavenly!! 
Love the atmosphere and service in that place! I dont live around that area but definitely worth waking up early and driving there for their sandwiches and salads"}
{"text":"First yelp review ever! This place rocks. Service is great and the food is to die for. Visiting from LA, I was happy to find better than average food in Phoenix. This is a must try for anyone."}
{"text":"I visited this deli while on vacation. Very delicious food, clean environment and friendly staff. I will definitely go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Surprisingly better than you might imagine. The cilantro salad is unique and excellent"}
{"text":"I will NEVER IN MY LIFE go and try this place at the restaurant now, nor will I recommend this place to anyone!! So I am on disability and I only have one car that my husband uses for work everyday. I sit at home all day with a 2 year old and have to order for delivery if I want something different every once in a while. So I found this place on a website called eat24. It seemed enticing and I seen it showed I had to have a minimum order of $30, which is high to expect delivery but when I order pizza I pay that so I wanted to give them a try. I waited about a week before actually placing an order. First off I called two days ago to verify the $30 min and the girl said yes. So I went to their actual website today to look at the full menu there, it shows $30 min, link to the eat24 website is on there menu and still it shows $30 min. So from 3 sources I got it needed to be $30 still for a delivery. I called just now to place my order and was now told that I had to now spend $50!!!!! WTF!! So I asked for the manager and was told exactly this: for us to send someone from OUR busy restaurant it would cost US $50 so YOU are now obligated to spend that $50 for us to do it. We don't have a designated driver for delivery! (THIS COMPANY OFFERS A SERVICE THAT THEY DONT HAVE A DESIGNATED PERSON FOR and we have to pay for it because they haven't hired a person just for this position!!!). So I as a small family am obligated to place an order for some DAMN SANDWICHES and spend $50 or I don't get a delivery!!!!!! How in the holy hell do you expect small families to drop that much money for 1 meal? That's fine dining prices for my family of 3 and its an utter rip off!!! It's a disgrace for a company to expect a $50 min order for some sandwiches. Plus false advertising on their part, they should have had everything updated the moment they chose to up the price. A lost customer forever!"}
{"text":"This place is so good!!! So glad I found it. All the girls who work there are very nice and it's quick! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"If you are in the area, and looking for a good sandwich place, I recommend checking them out!!.

The first time that I ate here (dine in), I ordered the 3 cheese grill cheese. I was hesitant to try any of the other items, even with the great reviews about their pastrami. I know what your probably thinking: A grill cheese?!? Really... I took it up a notch and had them add ham to the sandwich (choice of honey or smoke)!! Delicious!!

I am back again ordering the same thing (to-go)!! I couldn't remember the choice of ham I picked before, so today I ordered the sandwich with smoked ham!!.

The sandwich comes with a side of c-slaw which in general I don't like so I always pass on it. You can substitute it for fruit or a bag of chips for .50 I just ordered fries with my order.

Total cost of meal: around 9.69
~ Sandwich 4.99
~ Fries 2.00
~ Drink 1.69
~ added ham: unsure

I will be adding this place to my bookmarks!

#Ilovegoodfood"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches ! One of my favorites is the chipotle chicken sandwich ! I definitely recommend this place . Their costumer services is awesome as well !"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today and I'm so glad that i did!! The pastrami is the best I have ever had and I can't wait to go back and have another. Thank you NY Slicers for brining great food to the area"}
{"text":"NY Slicers is awesome!! Best sandwich place in AZ!! Can't get enough of this place! Feels like family when you walk in. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The Pastrami was fatty and greasy . Not what I expected for $7.99! The help was very nice and there was a large variety to choose from. The place was very smoky and my cloths now smell I believe from frying the pastrami."}
{"text":"If I could give Slicers 10 stars I would! The service is impeccable and the food is outstanding! The girls always have smiles on their faces and are ready to serve up the best food in AZ!!! Try the Rachel, you won't be disappointed! Love love love NY Slicers!"}
{"text":"Had a very nice lunch here today. Meatball sandwich was very good as well as the coleslaw. 

Service was also very good. 

F"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is the real deal-Portions are huge! I had the Rueben which was AMAZING! Not overly greasy and the corned beef was perfection! They have an office special ( $100 for 12 people) that I can't wait to order! 
This place is a must try if you are craving a real deli sandwich. I'm ecstatic we finally have a deli on the west side!"}
{"text":"They said on Monday they were going to deliver my sandwich, but today they said they can't make a delivery  for one sandwich. They credited me back my money on the credit card. It's a good thing I brought my lunch today. So I can't let you know if the \"Fat Boy\" I originally ordered is worth the $$."}
{"text":"Great food and great Serivce. The sisters that own the place are awesome. The Reuben and the Rachel are my favorite."}
{"text":"Let me say this food is great. Ordering is horrible I used fax 1 day had to place order for my employees. I get there order isn't ready they say the fax is not working. So the next day I emailed the order at 9am called @ 11:30 where's my delivery. Oh what do you know they didn't get it but yet i had taken the confirmation from the fax and had confirmation on email but they didn't get anything two days in a row smh. There hours suck who closes at 3 pm. I told my employees I'll never ever order or go here again. The girls that own this place need to get it together I guess when daddy buys you a business you don't take it serious no need to work hard if it's given to you!"}
{"text":"Best lunch spot in the area. Hands down. Beyond thankful to have found this spot. We now have a lunch spot when we are in Phoenix for business."}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop , kind of similar to Greenblatts in LA , ordered New Yorker Pastrami combo is very very good ! I'm sure rest of their sandwiches too"}
{"text":"Drove by several times around lunch, looked real busy so never stopped so today after the lunch rush I stopped in.  Had the pastrami and was excellent, employees are friendly and seems like a lot of repeat business. Will stop here again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I found this place a few months ago and I'm so glad I did! There aren't a lot of great dining options in the are (it's largely industrial), and this place is awesome. The wait times can be a little long because they get so busy, but that's just a testament to the quality. They have a pretty loyal following and a lot of menu variety. The staff is also extremely friendly and welcoming. 

Try the chicken salad!"}
{"text":"Deliciously amazing breakfast sandwich with wonderful Boar's Head ham!!! Sweetest owner and cleanest deli. We can't wait to come back to try lunch!"}
{"text":"Just popped in for lunch working in the area so glad that I did one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life super friendly staff clean place will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Another 5 star! A group of us came in from out of town to see if the hype was true! And I mean out of town!! Temecula, CA. 

The service was honestly the best part of the whole experience. I don't know if we were dealing with the owners or what, but they were awesome. One of them called two separate customers by their name. What a great environment. 

The sandwiches were really good. I had the chipotle chicken and loved it. Awesome bread, fresh, quality ingredients and nice portions add up to a satisfying experience. The sandwich came with a side of coleslaw and even it was good (and I'm not a slaw guy). 

Anyway, go try this fun and delicious sandwich place."}
{"text":"I found this nice deli restaurant that served a High Quality assortment of Boars Heads meats and cheeses. You cant be disappointed when you get served this brand. I asked the super cute, huge adorable smiled young lady (with cool hat) what her favorite was and she steered me toward the Rachel sandwich. Awesome corned beef, grilled rye bread, crispy cole slaw and dressing. The sandwich and customer service attention by all the young  ladies made my day. I sat around just to check it out and it looked like all the customers that were in and out when I was there, seemed very pleased. The salads look huge and delicious. Being in the F&B business for over 45 years I can only nit pick at the ceiling vents needing cleaning. This place gets Chef Johns 5 star approval. I will be back. Ladies keep up the awesome work you have a hidden gem here. Smiles are worth a million bucks."}
{"text":"I have to say the staff is friendly and very welcoming. We ordered the NY  pastrami sandwich and was very pleased with how fast the service was and how delisous the food was. I will definitely come back for more food."}
{"text":"My husband has been eating lunch here for awhile now and all he does is rave about how great it is.  I finally had the opportunity to join him for lunch and today I tried NY Slicers Deli for the first time.  The food was fantastic, the restaurant was clean, the staff was great the place overall was wonderful!  Also, Nina was so pleasant and friendly and treated everyone like family whether you were a regular like my husband or a first timer like me.  Thanks Ladies!"}
{"text":"Serious quality.  Boars heads meats.  Great breads.  Sandwiches flawlessly put together.  No skimping on meat.  Ordered extra meat first time and it was absurd amount.  French fries are delicious.  They are seasoned well (probably seasoned salt) very tasty and the fries are always perfect.  No nasty unedible ones.  Always consistently good.  This place does it right.  Suggest phoning in order as they get pretty busy and seem to do a lot of catering.  Not cheapest sandwich in town but you are paying for quality and I feel the value is there.  Good job ladies."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today... WOW this place is good! On top of the amazing food, the staff is really nice and personable. It's not close to my house but I would eat here every day if there was one in Tempe / Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I truly cannot say enough about this authentic NY deli. I first discovered it on Yelp and started ordering there for working lunches at my company. The word spread far and wide throughout the company about the incredible quality of their sandwiches. When I go in person, I often run into others from our company who also can't get enough. Even though, I order a variety, we still haven't tried them all but each new one we do try becomes our instant favorite. We've also had their Mediterranean food catered in, and it turned out to be perhaps the best lunch we've experienced out of many. Today, I pre-ordered but then asked for a salad after arriving. They made for me in minutes and it was . . . there are no words to express the great flavors.  They always greet me by name and the owner, Nina, usually comes from behind the counter for a hug. I felt special, but then realized they were also making others feel special."}
{"text":"One of the best meat ball sandwiches in the valley. First time going and I am very pleased. Also tried the chipotle chicken hot slider and I loved it. And the staff is very helpful as well!! Will go back! Not giving it 5 stars because they don't have coffee."}
{"text":"I had the pastrami sandwich and it was a bit too salty for my taste, but I enjoyed it all the same. The coleslaw helped cut the salty flavor so it was a great combo. If you enjoy salty meaty goodness then this place is for you! The service was quick and the staff are friendly. I will definitely come back for more if I find myself in the area."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! It's hard to find a decent, clean restaurant on this side of town that can compare to how good the food is here. The owners are engaging and their food is made fresh. Try the Rachel!"}
{"text":"The food is alright and over priced. When you place an order for pick up the order is NEVER correct. If they don't have something they'll just make you sandwich with whatever they do have. A few times I asked for chipotle in my breakfast burrito and when I picked it up no chipotles... I asked why and they said it will make the burrito soggy! That's ridiculous! I'm paying for it make it how I want! What happened to customers always right? I guess not at this place. 

It's very frustrating when you order something and they don't tell you over the phone that they're out of something... at least that way I can adjust my order. I gave this place many many chances and now I'm just done. 


If you don't have chipotle then say that when I place the order!!! Don't say ok over the phone, be honest up front with the customer."}
{"text":"It is a rare find to get a clean deli with good food on the west side. I had a Cobb salad which they prepared chicken breast fresh for the salad."}
{"text":"My first time there and my reason for going was the five star rating. Now, I give them five stars for customer service but for the food only two stars. I got two NY pastrami sandwiches with frys and coleslaw. Firstly this was the saltiest pastrami I've ever had and it was not palatable. The frys were soggy with no salt and the coleslaw bitter from to much vinegar. This was a waste of 23 dollars. I was very disappointed. I won't be going back to this place at all. If you're on a salt restricted diet stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Once again!  This place NEVER lets me down, I tried their tomatoe soup and a croissant tuna salad sandwich along with it! Absolutely tasty. I would definitely recommend anyone try this mix out. Thank you very much to the all the hard working Staff at this establishment. My lunch was very Delicious! !"}
{"text":"I have to tell you, this place has it ALL!!!! They have a good selection and the food is good! HOWEVER the thing I like best about this place is the HOT and I do mean SEXY Mexican's who run the place... MEOW!  I'm totally down to see more of them!!! 
Anywho...The food is the best around and they deliver... So check it out!"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly, only serving highest quality ingredients. Low score because of consistency. Ordered a meatball sandwich the day before busting with meatballs, sauce, and cheese. Next day got the exact same thing and it only had 3 meatballs leaving only bread on each end, very little sauce. Meatballs were delicious, but for the price I am looking for a consistent product. Unfortunately will probably not be back because of this. 

Thank you for the invitation back Nina. I did visit your place again. I did not ask for a free lunch because that is not why I write reviews and I didn't want special attention paid to my order. I ordered the meatball sandwich again and was very happy when I saw it hit the serving counter stuffed with meatballs and sauce. Unfortunately my smile went away quickly after the first bite as I found myself eating a cold sandwich. I was hoping to upgrade my review, but continued inconsistency has caused a downgrade. I don't write this review maliciously and many others love you and will continue to eat at your place, but I feel it is my responsibility to be honest about my experience."}
{"text":"I found this place by searching the map for a sandwich shop and then reading the reviews here to decide if I wanted to try it.
At first I was skeptical when I saw the ratings.
No one has ratings as good as this with so many 5 stars and so few low ratings (actually the lowest I found on the first few pages was a three star and it wasn't even a very negative review).

I was excited to see that they had a hot pastrami sandwich and that is what I got. Mmm it sure hit the spot.
I got a macaroni salad as the side and it too was pretty good. Not overly slimy like you get in most delis and it had an interesting pepper seasoning on it.

They seemed friendly and I noticed that the owner responded to the person with the one lower rating that I found. That is not something you see very often.

I have a few jobs I do in the area so I will certainly be back for more."}
{"text":"It's been a couple years since I've been in the neighborhood to eat at one of my favorite places, but I went there today. Still great food, fun staff, pleasant atmosphere. Everyone smiling having a good time, fresh meat, great bread. Always gooooood."}
{"text":"Enjoyed every minute. Great food. Friendly staff. Yummy cookies.  Worth the trip.  We are coming back soon."}
{"text":"We live in Chandler but needed to be on the west side of town for business. We went onto the Yelp app to find places to eat. This place popped up and looked really good.
Love the decor, food was really good! Nice Boar's Head meats thinly sliced on lightly grilled bread. The cole slaw was a bit dry but a little sweet and had big chunks of cabbage. Overall great place but one downside; no stone ground mustard. Most of the employees don't speak much English (Spanish) and gave me yellow mustard. On a rueben??? No! I'd say if you're running a NY deli, it would be nice to have at least one NYer there."}
{"text":"I have never written a review but after eating the NY Rachel pastrami  I had to leave a review. I am very picky about my pastrami and all I gotta say is that they have hit every mark on what makes a good pastrami. Come here and try the NY Rachel. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent stop on our way back from a painful Super Bowl.  The roll was perfect. Good selection of deli meats.  Thank you to for your inviting and friendly service."}
{"text":"First time in, I ordered the BBQ chicken salad and some French fries. I always hesitate when ordering salads to go because sometimes the salad gets soggy or the dressing gets warm, etc. but that wasn't the case! The salad was chopped fresh, all the ingredients were crisp, and it was really a massive salad - definitely big enough to split!

The French fries were also really good. Not too soft, just enough crunch. I asked for extra season salt on the side just per a previous review saying they weren't salty enough, but I found them to be exactly what I was wanting.

Overall, great food, really pleasant upbeat staff, and everything was put together in a timely manner. 

*only negative, is that you'll definitely smell like the restaurant when you leave. So if you're worried about smelling, shower when you get home.*"}
{"text":"FINALLY a decent place to eat for all us poor souls stuck working in the 43rd Ave Industrial area. They only opened a couple weeks ago and I've been back at least 5x, got my office in to get a delivery order and picked up sandwiches for dinner! I've tried the Rachel (Pastrami Reuben), Meatball, a Cobb Salad and a couple different variations of a Turkey sandwich. Everything has been awesome! Their Pastrami is unbelievable! The owners and staff are super friendly and very accommodating. I'll be back again...and again...and again..."}
{"text":"This is a great spot close to the freeway the people are extremely nice only thing missing is there's no ham"}
{"text":"Food quality is top notch.  The service is even better.  It is obvious that the team takes pride in the deli, it's employees and especially their customers.  From the first time I came in to give NY Slicers a try I felt welcome, was called by name and truly felt like they cared about me.  I have been returning about once a week for more than a year as a result.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"Just went here as a lunch stop on a route, and I was NOT disappointed. A lot of my coworkers rave about how great this place is, and it is GREAT. I mean GREAT. I got the NY pastrami; and it was probably the best I've ever eaten! The staff is super friendly and awesome too! I'll be here every week!"}
{"text":"Good Sandwiches

Today, I went to the 'NY Slicers Deli' for lunch.   NY Slicers offers a variety of great sandwiches, soups, and daily specials, at very reasonable prices.

On this visit I ordered the Triple Threat 
(Ham, turkey, salami, mayo, oil, vinegar, lettuce and tomato) and my lunch companion had the grilled cheese. The sandwiches at NY Skicers are huge and very filling.  Our sandwiches were delicious, the grilled cheese was cooked just right and the bread on both sandwiches  was very fresh.

The staff at NY Slicers are very friendly, helpful, and accommating.  I 
highly recommended, NY Skicers if you like traditional deli sandwiches."}
{"text":"I order from NY quite frequently since I work close. I have ordered the pastrami sandwich twice now requesting NO MUSTARD. However over the phone they don't seem to comprehend that. After picking it up and driving back to work I find there is mustard on my sandwich. It has been 3 times that this has happened. Lost a customer."}
{"text":"I wished I could give more stars, but I think my lunches would be better if I was male. I know that is unfortunate to hear, but it's the truth. Not only will they take people's orders that are in line behind you but every time they do it, it is only for men.  I agree with another yelper on inconcistent food. My sandwich today has two huge pickles on it and it's a philly cheese steak. It shouldn't have any pickles at all and never has before when I have ordered it ."}
{"text":"Decent sandwich especially for Arizona. Can do hoagie or bread.  I have had both, both good. 
They mainly use Boars Head but this does not always guarantee a great sandwich. Sandwiches Have a decent amount of cold cuts, veggies were fresh. Comes with a 1/4 lb of salad, Mac, potato, cole slaw etc. 
Refreshing take instead of Subway or Jimmy Johns where it's a bread sandwich. I from New York and this tries, but you can't get the bread that's there."}
{"text":"These gals kick butt! Nina the owner and her sister rock some serious sandwich. All Boars Head products. So, quality is never an issue. Located right off of the I-10 just south on 43rd avenue makes for easy on/off freeway transition.

Totally in the New York fashion by New York sweethearts. The whole group is fun and the food awesome... Stop in if you are in the neighborhood; it will not dissappoint... plus, they are all very attractive. HUBBA HUBBA! #vino2ultimate #vinosquared"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches!!!! I could eat here everyday!

I've had 4 different sandwiches here and all are amazing!

The people are great too! I will be bummed to go back home and not have this place close by!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been on the search for a good Italian Sub since I moved hear from Santa Monica, CA.  I used to eat at Bay Cities Italian Deli which has the best Italian Sub I have ever eaten.  If you are ever in Santa Monica, don't miss it!

I have tried dozens of sub shops on my quest to find something comparable and nothing has compared.  NY Slicers is the closest I have found.  Get your favorite sub sandwich on their fresh baked baguette, you won't be disappointed.

I so wish they had a location near me!!!  At least they are right off the freeway; I will be back next time I am driving by!"}
{"text":"People were awesome they are all smiling and happy . creating a good atmosphere!  And the food was great .  we've been twice already"}
{"text":"1st time visit.  Ordered 2 sandwiches on line for carry out.  Line was to the door.  Good indicator of what is coming my way.  Had the Rachel and a Pastrami.  Both fantastic sandwiches."}
{"text":"NY Slicers is great. I work over this way and it's a bit of a food desert but NYSD is a great treat. The service is always excellent, the place is clean, and the ladies who work here are very friendly. The food is exceptional but I'm always partial to the Rachel if you're looking for a home run recommendation.

You can also order from the Yelp/Eat24 app if you have a bit of a commute and don't want to wait in-store."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best sandwich I've ever had in my life. They toast the bread with a little bit of butter so the outside is crispy and savory like the outside of a grilled cheese, the portions are generous, and the ratio of meat to veggies to condiments is perfect.

Definitely coming back here every time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on our way home to CA! This place and the girls that run it are ! The positive vibes when you walk in are fire! They are super friendly and the food is off the hook! 

Highly highly recommend"}
{"text":"Best food within 10 miles worth the extra drive.  The ladies that run the restaurant are awesome very friendly fast service.  Thanks NY Slicers for filling up some hungry fireman's bellys!"}
{"text":"I hate giving them 3 stars but I have a good reason.  The first time I went there, I ordered 2 breakfast burritos with pastrami.  They were amazing.  5 stars all the way.  Loaded with pastrami and the rest of the burrito was delicious as well.  The salsa was great and the service was pretty good.  
This last time I went, I ordered 5 burritos for the my in-laws, wife and I.  After bragging these things up, we get them home and start eating and I am not exaggerating at all, there was approximately, 1-2 ounces of pastrami per burrito.  They were loaded with potatoes and that was about all.  I was extremely disappointed in the quality and lack of constancy.  
So in closing, I would recommend going there but I would also recommend checking your food before leaving to make sure it is what you ordered.  I am hoping this was a one time mistake.  We will see."}
{"text":"This crumb cake I had was amazing service was great definitely coming back.  The Ruben was the best, great customer service"}
{"text":"Great deli!! Couldn't ask for much more, and the owner, Nina I believe, was a fantastic host! Even the brownie I had for dessert was unbelievable! If I lived closer, I would come here at least twice a week.. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"fantastic customer service and even better food. Very impressed , definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"I returned to Phoenix for spring training and had to make sure and stop at my favorite sandwich place in the area.  The sandwiches are still fantastic with fresh ingredients and generous portions. 

The staff is always friendly, even when swamped, and are willing to offer suggestions and answer questions. I only came in twice last spring (because of timing, I would have visited more often if my work schedule allowed) yet when I returned a year later the owner remembered my name!

I ordered a cracked pepper turkey and salami sandwich on rye with double meat, but even a total single portion would have been plenty. It was, as expected, delicious. And fresh."}
{"text":"I found this gem by searching nearby by restaurants on the freeway. Right as we walked in we were greeted by all the staff. The owner/ manager went above and beyond. She asked us if we liked our meals. She also knew a lot of people's names and orders. The food was very fresh. There are excellent bread and cheese selections. You also can turn any sandwich into a lettuce wrap which I loved. The French fries came out hot and had good seasoning. The coleslaw was just ok. I enjoyed the seasonal fruit which was sweet watermelon. After our family finished our sandwiches the owner/manager called us over to give us three freshly baked cookies for our car ride. They were the perfect! I would definitely recommend checking out this deli! It's a small town vibe right off the freeway!"}
{"text":"In from out of town for a business meeting. Put in an order for 20 sandwiches last minute through Yelp. They JD it ready in 40 minutes with a smile. Seriously best service I've ever gotten for catered lunch. This will be my go-to for future business meetings!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find good healthy food near my work. I literally go here every week. They are always friendly and their food is consistently delicious and made fresh. They fresh bake cookies throughout the day and their sides are never soggy. I recommend everyone to Slicers. The employees always have a smile on your face even when the store is packed. See you next week!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! As soon as I walked in I was greeted. One tip, get there early for lunch as they get extremely busy. 

They proudly serve boars head, which is one of my favorites. Today, being my first time, I ordered the Cal chicken and it's awesome. Grilled chicken, caramelized onion, avocado aoli, warmed in a soft, sub roll, with lettuce and tomato- delicious! 

It comes with a side of cole slaw, that was a bit to dry and needed more sauce, at a reasonable price at $7.99. I grabbed a bag of chips to go with it, no drink, all in all lunch today was $10.31.

I was impressed how the young lady in the front(possibly an owner?) greeted customers by name...looks like a big following of repeat customers they have, which again is why you need to get there early as they get busy(I was there @11:30). 

If you're in this area I would suggest stopping in and try them out. I know that I'll be going back."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat.  The staff was friendly and the food is amazing.  I work in this area and found this place through YELP.  Will be back for sure.  The hot speciality sandwiches are my favorite."}
{"text":"Had the \"triple threat\" along with a coworker and it was super fresh, tasty and a good size for lunch. Staff was friendly and also the girl behind the counter was a bombshell but I digress hehe."}
{"text":"Very nice person at the counter. Tried the New Yorker Pastrami,  and I can say it was the best Pastrami I have ever eaten.  Also great to have a cuisine that is not Mexican in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"They make good quality sandwiches.  I had the tuna sandwich and it had so much tuna, I had to split it.  For lunch, I would rather pay less and have a sandwich I could finish in an hour.  My coworker got the hotdog and he said it was amazing!  I'm glad they are here and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Holy cow the food was awesome and the service was amazing.  The workers were so sweet and helpful and very bubbly. I would defiantly come back again."}
{"text":"Ordered the Rachel. (Rueben, but with coleslaw instead of sauerkraut) perfectly grilled, nothing microwaved. Coleslaw was real sweet, This sandwich is amazing. Definitely my new lunch spot on this side of town."}
{"text":"Sadly I have never had an authentic east coast sandwich. As much as they like to brag and talk up there meat creations I had to give this place a shot. It was a bit out of the way but totally worth the trip.

I order the corned beef rueben. It comes on rye bread, slices of swiss and topped with Russian dressing and sauerkraut. Divine tangy combination, throw in some coleslaw and an order of hot salty fries, it was an amazing birthday lunch. Even got some free tasty brownies.

In short amazing place, delicious food, good prices, perfect sized sandwiches, kind and welcoming people, I don't have enough good things to say about this place. If this really is what east coast sandwiches are all about I can see what all the love is about."}
{"text":"Great little deli. Very friendly staff take good care of customers and the food is fantastic"}
{"text":"I haven't had very good experiences with this place.  I came here when they first opened and it still hasn't improved.

The last time, my sandwich was made incorrectly and I was given the incorrect side.

When you're in this business, you can't really afford to get simple things wrong since there are plenty of other options.

For that reason, I won't be visiting NY Slicers Deli for the foreseeable future.

If you're in that area, just drive up to Romanelli's on 35th and Dunlap."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I've ever had! I ordered some California chicken sandwich, can't remember the name exactly. It came with coleslaw, which as someone who is picky about coleslaw was really good. It wasn't soggy or too sweet, it was great. The chicken on the sandwich was sliced chicken breast, not lunchmeat, and had a ton of flavor. The only bummer is this place is limited hours and not open on weekends. But if you can squeeze in during a lunchtime on a weekday, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and pretty staff greeted with smiles and a sincere welcome. Tried the Rachel and it was not disappointed. Fresh sandwich made to order is enough to return but did I forget to mention the pretty girls?"}
{"text":"Smaller seating area, mostly due to how busy this place gets for the lunch time rush. Their sandwiches are made fresh with top quality meat and cheeses from Boars Head, great bread and excellent sauces. Like many delis you can pick up a salad or pasta and for desert you can eat or take home a delicious freshly baked cookie or brownie."}
{"text":"Ok, where do I begin? I just had the best sandwich of my life! The New York Rachel...Hot pastrami on toasted rye bread, topped with creamy cole slaw - juicy, drippy & toasty...Oh My Gosh!  The fries were crispy & a little spicy, not too much, not too little. A hot, gooey chocolate chip cookie fresh out of the oven. If you grew up in Phoenix, you should remember the great Miracle Mile Deli at the old Christown & old Park Central locations and I had not found a sandwich I loved since....well, move over old memories because NYSlicers Deli has stolen my heart and has a new place setting at my dinner table!!"}
{"text":"The Jody is my go-to at least once a week. Cracked pepper turkey on baguette with yellow mustard and chipotle aioli, lettuce, tomato, peppercini and pickles and avocado. This is actually part of their secrete menu."}
{"text":"Super good sandwiches. They carry Boar's Head meats, so you know it's good. If it's your first time try the pastrami, it's super good. They can add anything to the sandwich you want. My favorite creation is 3 cheese grilled cheese with bacon and avocado. The atmosphere is fun and the staff is always super nice!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and service. There are not a lot of worth while places to eat in this area so I gave them a shot.

They serve high quality eats here including clubs and hot ruben sandwiches. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This deli has awesome sandwiches!  I had the pastrami and it was very delicious!  The fries had a nice seasoning but they were a little soggy!  Probably could have cooked a little longer!

I highly recommend this place if your in the area!"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad. The service is phenomenal though! My sandwich had a bun that almost as hard as a rock. Maybe that's how it's supposed to be. Not sure. I will be back again to try something else. The salads looked really good btw"}
{"text":"Very fare find, great food that's not your typical fast food vibe. The staff does an amazing job at making you feel welcome and appreciated, I can honesty say their food and service is some of the best I've ever seen. Don't forget to pick up a homemade cookie or brownie either, it's a great way to finish an amazing sandwich."}
{"text":"Its my first time being there and I find the place amazing the food is great the staff is helpful and the cashier is so pretty I have the pastrami sandwich and it is a simple sandwich with bread and cheese and hot pastrami that's all you can ask for that's all you need definitely coming back this place is the bomb.com"}
{"text":"FIRST AND LAST ORDER. 

$50 minimum order for delivery. Coleslaw leaked all over the inside of the bag. What a mess. None of the sandwiches marked. Missing a drink. Delivery driver (owner) had no change for a $20. Sandwiches were mediocre at best. PASS."}
{"text":"Very good sandwich shop! It's about time someone recognized that there wasn't anything good to eat in this area. Just fast grease. Bleh. Service was very fast and SUPER friendly, order was correct and they weren't chincie on the portions. I had the tuna sammie. The side of macaroni salad was meh, but most are. The only request I have is to offer a sweet pumpernickel bread. They do use Boars Head products. Out the door my meal was $9.72. If you work around here and want a meal that want make you feel sick, this is your place."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop for lunch.  People were EXTREMELY friendly and the food was good.  Owner gave us free homemade cookies when she found out that we were from out of town.  Clearly a 5 star place,  5 star  service."}
{"text":"I appreciate the business here. It is uncommon to find a quality lunch restaurants around that does not serve typical fast food venue items. I really enjoyed the chicken wrap. The staff is friendly and upbeat.

I was impressed and I appreciated when I called ahead and requested it to be prepared by a specific time, and they had my order ready just in time during my short thirty minute lunch break. They have a friendly and courteous staff. Thanks Slicers for being my go to lunch restaurant."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are to die for! I order a different sandwich each visit and have been amazed everytime. Also, the staff is amazingly friendly and attentive. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Since reading the review from Jim D. I had to try the pastrami. It was wonderful like the rest of the food. Give it another try Jim. C'mon man!"}
{"text":"Me and my bf just went to slicers for the first time and it was AMAZING! I had the Cali chicken slicer and he had the Rachel. Both were awesome, but we both agreed we liked the Rachel the most. Store was clean and the staff was so sweet. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Awesome place. The sandwiches Are amazing their customer service is above and beyond. Which is really hard to find. Definitely found our lunchtime spot. Thank you ladies for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Trying to find new places to eat. NY slicers popped up. I like to read reviews first before I go. I saw nothing but good reviews. So decided to come try it out. I have to say that they have AMAZING FOOD. I will for sure be coming back. They are such nice people as well. If you haven't been here yet. Try it at least once. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"What an outstanding place to have lunch! Fresh bread, Boarshead meats and good service!"}
{"text":"Okay so my husband (Calvin) has been boasting about this place that he has tried many times but I have never - Until Today ! I stopped in and got 2 orders to go for my husband and I for lunch today . He requested a Meatball and I went for the NY Rachel . It was so good. This place exceeded my expectations . I am so glad that my hubby mentioned to place to me. I only wished they were opened a little later or on the weekends. The staff is truly amazing. I met Nina today and she was so sweet and nice to me. The entire staff is truly awesome. They  really make you feel welcome. The place was clean and very nice inside. It actually smells so good the moment you walk in. I can not wait to go back again and try another . I again highly recommend this place to everyone . You will not disappointed . I sure was not . And I am vey picky about my food and where it comes from. Thank you Nina and the entire staff at NY Slicers, I will be back soon."}
{"text":"I went to NY Slicers for the first time today. Being from back east, finding food that reminds me of home is not the easiest.  This place is the real deal. The sandwiches are delicious, the portions are generous and the staff - let's just say, they remind me of back home! 

They are open limited hours to cater to their prime customer base, I wish they were open later in the day so I could go outside of work hours.  

Very impressed and I WILL be back."}
{"text":"Decent sandwich spot. A little pricey but I don't mind paying for good pastrami! People are friendly and welcoming. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing food and amazing people who work there. Always so friendly. The salads are to die for. Always fresh ingredients on all their items."}
{"text":"The best sandwich I've ever had in my life! Pastrami is high quality. Go here everyday!"}
{"text":"Probably the best sandwich shop that I've been to in Arizona. The Rachel is a little small (for me onky because I'm huge) but it is AMAZING! However, you must ask for the Braylon as it's their best sandwich and an off the menu item :)"}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday for the first time and was blown away by how good it was. The place is super clean, the employees (whom all seem to be ladies) are friendly, polite and very happy and upbeat.  Now the food... AMAZING.  I had the NY pastrami and it was delicious. I cannot wait to go back and try another sandwich or build my own.  Why am I typing this review at lunch when I'm starving?!?!?!? UGH!!  Now I think I have to eat lunch there for the second day in a row... it's that good.

Menu is simple and affordable.  Stop in and let them know that they are highly recommended by YELP elite! ;)"}
{"text":"Corned beef is awesome. It's the best deli I've been to out here in AZ. Only downside is they are so far from my house."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB! Skip the boring chains and come to the locally owned breakfast and lunch gem. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but my personal favorite is the Rachel. You're greeted by a happy and sincere staff and leave 100% satisfied. If you're looking for the best sandwiches, subs or lunch salads in town, this is it!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant experience I had here for lunch. I would have never known about it if it was not for Yelp.  It is in a random strip mall in an industrial part of west Phoenix. However, it is near my work so on short days I will have to stop by on my way home. It is not the best NY Deli in town but still very good so giving it Kudos on the stars on it's own accord and South West Phoenix is a foodie wasteland when it comes to non Mexican food. I gave the place five stars, and my friends know I am picky with the five stars, because they have Boars Head meats, the owner/manager, I think she said her name was Jen, is fantastic. I observed her for a while during my visit and she really is very special, kind to all her guests, and very customer centered. Jen knew all the customers by name. Gotta love that. I also love seeing kids behind the counter. It reminds me so much of NY. 

I had my go to, a chicken salad sandwich. I got a little daring and ordered it on Rye instead of a baguette. It was good. The folks at the table next to me said their meatball was great. I know a return trip is necessary. lol  I think the specialties here are the Pastrami's and Corn Beef type of NY sandwiches. The Rachel looked awesome!  I do not like those things but the customers were saying they were the best in town. 

The only thing I can add is that maybe they can carry Yoo-Hoo and Wise products. Please consider adding Onion Rolls to the bread choices too. Also, I like Coke products better than Pepsi but that is a life long argument and debate for another day. Ha!

Literally, the place was jamming with special orders from companies in the area. I overhead all saying this is the new it spot for lunch nearby. I am happy to hear it. I will most definitely be visiting more often. 

Thank you for such a lovey lunch experience."}
{"text":"Just tried them for the first time and phone ordered the chicken salad sandwich and the nice lady recommended it toasted on sourdough bread with provolone cheese and it was amazing! Probably the best I have tasted so far.. Excellent service, I will definitely be coming back!"}
