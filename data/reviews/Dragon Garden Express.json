{"text":"Very clean, quiet atmosphere with amazing food at great prices. Perfect for a meal after work."}
{"text":"Zero stars... Horrible service. Ordered cashew shrimp. All there was was celery, peas and a few pieces of shrimp. Tasted bland but the biggest complaint was two things, the service, and the fact that werent willing to exchange or refund it for something else. only till i argued with them were they willing to change it to something else. The shrimp dish was not even eaten and he said i was taking advantage of their service. But it could of easily been solved. he refunded the uneaten bowl or exchanged it. Since he didn't want to refund me he just makes mongolian beef. \"10 pieces of shrimp\" is in the dish but my bf and i only counted a few. the mongolian beef was made, i gave the previous dish back but he said \"i cannot accept it anymore\" because its touched. So i just put it back on the table we were sitting at. He brings the new order of mongolian beef and takes the shrimp and throws it in the trash in front of us. While the cook and the cashier just stare at us the whole time. Feeling unwelcomed we just left. There were no lids for soda either. Your better off just going to another resturant near by because then you will be better taken care off."}
{"text":"I was hoping the food was as good as the reviews, but I was left disappointed. I ordered the Mongolian beef. While the flavor was good, the beef was low quality and there was as much onion in the dish as they can get away with. I would say it was over 50% onion. If the beef quality was better, I'd be okay with that much onion. It's pretty clear they are trying to make their food as cheap as possible so they can pocket more money. I don't think I'll be back. There's higher quality Chinese for the same price."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for almost seven years , they have been very consistent and have been one of my favorite places to eat Chinese fast food , the shrimp fried rice has always been my favorite , and the waitress there has always been very good to me not to mention she is nice on the eyes ....."}
{"text":"The food was disgusting we ordered sweet and sour chicken and Mongolian beef. It tasted so old like it had been sitting all day only 3 peppers in the sweet and sour chicken and really old green onion in the mongolian beef to top it off roaches in the bathroom. I will never return"}
{"text":"You know, it doesn't bode well for an establishment when the Jetta R. has to preface the visit with advice that I \"brace\" myself. If the food is at all decent it wouldn't require an introduction warning me about the lack of \"atmosphere\" or \"warmth.\" 

Literally, Dragon Garden has all the ambiance of a Dunkin' Doughnuts. Sterile white, pop-in lettered menu boards, humming soft drink case. Cafeteria-y. Staffed by my mother's body double who wasn't doing any cool stunts. Bummer.

Jetta R. ordered the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce. I didn't dare stray too far into the menu. I ordered the same. Hey, I like lobster sauce. And it comes with an egg roll and some fried wantons and fried rice. Groovy. 

Ok, this is not lobster sauce. This is \"viscous white goo with eggy bits that tastes mildly of chicken broth.\" 5-6 shrimps dwarfed by GIANT chunks of green bell pepper and onion. It didn't taste bad, just bland. Fried wantons full of dried out pork. Moving on. Egg roll tastes like Wong's. Speculated that maybe the staff just walks across the street and orders their day's supply there. Again, not bad, just bland. Fried rice = dry rice tossed in soy sauce. I ended up picking out the shrimp, eating the egg roll, and considered the rest a loss. Might have been salvageable with hot sauce, but there was none to be found. 

Dragon Garden has a few things going for it. You get more volume for your dollar on the lunch specials, so it's good if you need to fill up quick and you're not picky. You'll probably never have to wait in line. The staff is nice and the kitchen is quick. Everything seems very clean, and the food is pretty basic Chinese-American fare.



TL; DR version: Go for lunch specials, bring hot sauce."}
{"text":"Their fried rice was old and very dark. Like they used a lot of soy sauce. Not a fan. Not going back"}
{"text":"Eh, it was just okay. Nothing to write home about and not something we will rush back to try again. Especially since there are so many other better options in the local area!"}
{"text":"Great taste fast service nice guy!! 21.00 for 4 to eat.  Combos have egg roll and self serve s soda. Highly reccomended. If traveling through I'll stop again.  Kids loved it hubby loved it: )"}
{"text":"I was recommended to come here from my sister. First time trying this place out, and I love it. My dinner tonight was so good! Everything was good! I love it! Customer service is great here too, so if anyone craving for some Chinese fast food, this place is highly recommended! Out of 7 dishes I got I remembered 1 plate, and that is the Mongolian beef! It melts in your mouth and so much flavor!!! I love it!!!"}
{"text":"Their food is amazing and I seriously love the crab puffs! The Chinese food here is absolutely enjoyable and will definitely get you full. The customer service is very friendly!"}
{"text":"So I decided to try this place for the first time being that I was starving and it was open on a holiday which I applaud them for... But I completely regret it! It's the first and last time I eat from here. Sorry for the horrible review, but it has been honestly the worst Chinese food I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"I love their foods affordable and u have a choice whether   It's spicy or not the employees are so helpful and courteous"}
{"text":"Food is Awesome! Had the beef lo mein and pork fried rice. Joyce is an awesome host. Thankyou!"}
{"text":"It was a Saturday. I think. I can't be so sure of it these days. I live my life with such reckless abandon that every day might as well be Saturday. But I'm pretty sure this was one of those \"real Saturdays\" where walking around in my jammies and showing up at people's houses at 10pm with the latest knock-off \"mockbuster\" on DVD is considered \"normal behavior\" and not chalked up to \"harmless yet nonetheless annoying eccentricity\".

With the recent price hikes on campus (4.99 for a sandwich that thinks it's a burrito? Have your mental disorder on your own dime, punk!), I've taken to \"brown bagging\" (which is what I call it even though I carry my lunch in a metal Dr. Pepper lunchbox that also doubles as a purse. I'm eccentric. Didn't you get the memo?) my on-campus meals. 

Which means I spend my weekends at Fry's looking at the lunch meat aisle going \"Hmmm...which of these could I eat every day for two weeks and not forcibly strangle myself with my own vomit?\"

On my way back to my car, laden with plastic bags full to bursting with failure and sad, I passed by the Dragon Garden Express, glancing at their menu. 

I initially decided against it, heading back to my car so I could feng shui my refrigerator to accommodate my ASU Meal Plan, when I heard the restaurant calling me.

Which is a metaphor for \"crazy manager screaming at me from the door\".

\"YOU WANT MENU TO TAKE HOME!?\"

Nah, I thought. If I took home a menu I'd just sit there, thinking of how much happier I'd have been if I spent my grocery money on an afternoon's worth of sweet and sour pork.

\"YOU COME IN THEN! GET SOMETHING TO GO!\"

Maybe the screaming Asian woman related to my lament. Perhaps she thought her cuisine would lift my spirits.

Or maybe it was a really slow day.

I decided to come inside before anyone got hurt.

You know how in the early Mario Bros games, you always played as Mario, although the manuals clearly state that Luigi is faster and can jump higher than the crimson-hued Ron Jeremy?

That's how it felt when I walked in.

Even though it was the weekend, DGE still offered lunch specials. Most places, Wong's included, exclude weekends from any of their lunch of dinner specials. Which is convenient, of course, because that's when Wong's gets most of its customers. DGE, despite it clearly being Saturday, offered 5 and 6 dollar lunch combos. 

The atmosphere in DGE is just...happier. I'm not sure how to describe it. When I go to other local Chinese restaurants the mood is so dapper. Like everyone's just waiting for that screenplay to writing to get picked up. Like the whole \"serve cuisine of our homeland\" game got really old, really fast, but they put all their eggs in one basket and have to wait for them to hatch and become dragons and burn the village or something. 

But DGE just has this happy, quiet vibe to it. And clean to boot. The place is splotless, with a hint of chow mein goodness. If I ever own a house, that's what I'd want my kitchen looking/smelling like all the time.

Initially I was hesitant to try the combos. Because I'm not big on fried rice. That's Panda Express' redeeming quality. It lets me have my lo mein noodles on the side, instead of demanding that I have it as an entree.

I figure if you can get a Big Mac with chicken nuggets on the side, I should be able to get mu shu with lo mein on the side. Oh well.

I took the plunge anyway. I got the kung pao. They boxed it up in one of those styrofoam take-home boxes with the smiling face. Which I always find a nice touch. All these other places like to decorate their packaging with proclamations of how awesome their product is. This was a thank you note and motivational propaganda all at once. I love the digital age.

The kung pao was cruncy and soupy, like a chicken and peanut cereal. It was like eating a salad and occasionally drinking from a cup of hot sauce at the same time. The egg roll was chewy and savory, the rangoons were crispy and cheesy, and the small mound of fried rice was fine also.  

I was too involved in plowing through my awesome with a side of FUCKYEAH! that I couldn't even be bothered to tell my housemates where I had discovered this little treasure trove of chicken, peanuts, and whatever the hell else they put in kung pao. 

I just kept showing them my receipt, which I kept just in case I had to add in the business info when I eventually yelped it. 

The moral of this mindless, meandering story? 

If you want good, cheap takeout on a weekend, do Dragon Garden Express.

Or they will scream at you."}
{"text":"came during the lunch hour and no one was here. that should have been my clue. the teriyaki chicken was dry and hard on the edges. the chicken lo mein was super salty. the egg rolls tasted old.
the only good thing about the place was the nice Asian couple that worked there, very polite and caring; however that doesn't make up for their lack of culinary skills."}
{"text":"Even if this place is more of a fast food place, I LOVE this place! Even though I don't live or work near here, I love stopping by here. I love the Shrimp Chow Fun and the Salt and Pepper Wings. Other yummy items are the Pot Stickers and Crab Puffs. There really isn't a bad dish here. The chef is a sweet older guy with a friendly smile. The servers are also easy to talk to. This place is a small mom and pop shop so support the small businesses!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Generals Chicken and the Walnut Shrimp. Also worth noting, for a hole in the wall place it just got a perfect score for food inspection. Great grub!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great
 Sal and pepper shrimp are on point. I had the house fried rice, the noodles and the pot stickers. Amazing food and great prices with nice people. Will be going back regularly"}
{"text":"\"You don't sew with a fork, so I see no reason to eat with knitting needles.\" -Miss Piggy, on Chinese food

Whenever I find myself driving halfway to California, aka Avondale, I like to pop into this hole-in-the-wall for some good eats. It's a small little restaurant with delicious food. Baby blue paint is on the walls, a redwood counter, and a friendly face to take your order at the register. Don't forget to tip because they really bust their butt to get your order to you while it's hot --- I once saw this guy and this girl mow each other over while balancing a hot bowl of soup! 

I generally go for Walnut Shrimp but the Orange Chicken and Chicken Lo Mein have been capturing my taste buds. Their egg rolls are pretty good too since they make it in-house! It's better than the crap they serve across the street and the joint in the Savers plaza, not to mention janky Panda Express. So come here for some great eats! This review has been approved by Grandmaster Linh!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Good Chinese Food. 
Very fast and reasonably priced. We are always greeted well when we come in."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. Ordered 2 entree's for $18 w/tax and the chicken was the worst that i've ever had from anywhere. It was burnt, fatty, and had bones/gristle.  Called to complain and the person I spoke to on the phone didn't seem to care at all."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place for Chinese food. I've been coming here for a couple of years. I always get the BBQ Pork Slices with some rice but I have been known to get the pork fried rice and the whole duck. I also like the vegetable spring rolls as it is the ONLY way I eat vegetables. 

The staff here are really friendly and I love it here. I hope you love it here too!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave them 1 star is because there is no option for 0. My order was messed up and when I called them they say that more money!! Really if I order orange chicken and fried rice shouldn't I get that? I would not go to eat here as the food is not good and the service is horrible."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for dinner while my son had practice. It was great. Food was fresh. Fast service. Clean restaurant. But more important,  very friendly staff and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Awesome little Chinese restaurant.  Came here to celebrate my sisters birthday.  

The restaurant was small, clean and decently kept for a fast food joint.  The loo was pretty decent too.  I wouldn't mind doing a two here.  

The food was definitely one of the best compared to other Chinese American restaurants.  Very tasty and full of flavour.  They have excellent egg rolls, great Mongolian Beef.  Awesome Beef Chow Fun, with a great fire wok flavour.  They have okay chicken cream corn soup.  We also have their special secret items too like the stir fried green beans and their juicy BBQ pork ribs!  Be sure to ask about it, it's legendary.  But they might not sell it.  

The workers were definitely super attentive, friendly, and professional.  Excellent job to the guy with the silver hair and the little girl with the gold hair, super elite professionals they are.  

Overall a great experience, will definitely be back!  They do take out too and take phone orders."}
{"text":"I'm honestly an extremely picky eater, my family as well, maybe that's where I get it from? We've been coming here for years, and we've never had a problem. I'm now a junior in college and I had my first plate of Mongolian beef probably at the age of five, lunch special #6 is a must try! Always have been my parent's favorite but I ventured out. I decided to try their shrimp fried rice and pot stickers, seriously the best I ever had. No matter where I go, no place beats Dragon Garden. My sister heard my extreme happiness about our family favorited restaurant, she tried their shrimp chow fun, she too agrees that there's no place like the good ol' Dragon Garden Express. Some other favorites of mine are their twice cooked chicken and walnut shrimp. Their soups are also quite delicious, their chicken cream corn soup with wonton strips are to die for!  My cousin is vegetarian so when she goes she gets their ma-pao fried tofu and their vegetable delight, so there are options for vegetarians. 
Their prices are great compared to all the other places around, super cheap for large portions. I've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes, even with large orders of food. Their service is great as well, the owner and his wife are absolutely welcoming, and the waitress is always friendly.
As for the setting, if you choose not to take out, the place is roomy and spacious.  There is also a table for outside dining as well just in case if you have pets.
It's unfortunate I had to move out of the state. Not even going to lie, before I hit the road on my last trip with the move in truck to Cali, my last stop in Arizona was Dragon Garden. Every time I make it back, I definitely make the run for some pot stickers, even California's Chinese can't compare. YES! this place is that good! 
Good food, good people, good prices, good vibes, what more could you want? I'd recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great friendly service, delicious combos for a great price!! Everything on the menus is yummy!!"}
{"text":"Worst egg drop soup, not sure how a Chinese food place can mess that up but they did, I called and nicely expresses my concern, they said sorry and did not offer a refund or to give me something else."}
{"text":"I ordered the vegetarian egg foo young and a some hot & soar soup. Both were very good- both in taste and portion size. It was enough for me and my boyfriend and less than $15. The ambiance isn't that great but the staff was fast & courteous."}
