{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here from great customer service to really decent quality food. I was there on their patio for their Early dinner specials - a 3 course meal for $15 that was well worth it. I had a salmon pasta and it tasted better than many higher end Italian restaurants. Our server was amazingly accommodating as well - there was a bee that landed at the mouth of my beer and she offered to grab me a new one right away. Overall the selection for that special dinner was quite extensive as well and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Glow is a beautiful restaurant, located at CF Shops at Don Mills. The layout is great and its outdoor seating is beautiful. Yet, the food at Glow was not what I expected. I went with family and friends for dinner- each of us getting something different. I decided on the turkey burger and let's just say have you seen a burger without bread? That wasn't the only surprise- the turkey itself was not that tasty, leaving me overall unsatisfied. If you're ordering from the dinner menu, I recommend the \"baked arctic char\" because from what everyone got, that tasted the best!"}
{"text":"After three long years of hard work, long hours at the library studying for exams, and thousands of dollars paid in tuition, my friends and I decided to celebrate our graduation and success at Glow Fresh Grill & Wine Bar.

Located in the heart of Shops at Don Mills (Don Mills Rd and Lawrence Ave), Glow Fresh Grill & Wine Bar, or Glow, is the perfect destination for food, drinks, and a great view from their patio.

Making reservations for Glow was fairly easy and they were very accommodating.  Unlike some places, they were able to reserve a table for our party of eight on the day of (I had made the reservations while lining up to walk into our graduation ceremony, 5.5 hours before our dinner reservation).  When we arrived at Glow, they had our table already set up, where we had a great view of the outside, could sit comfortably, and could draw the attention of the staff there at anytime.

The menu, created by Rose Reisman (you may recognize her name from Pickle Barrel) had a wide variety of food, from ahi tuna, to veal, to bunless burgers.  Their wine and alcohol list was quite extensive, with various wines from all different regions in the world.  Unfortunately, I had forgotten to bring my ID, but from what my friends had said, the drinks were pretty good.  From the menu, I ordered the summer pasta primavera, and the potato medley, along with an iced tea.

The summer pasta primavera was quite good.  It had rigatoni tossed with asparagus, sweet peas, spinach, tomatoes, sliced garlic & white wine aioli, topped with goat cheese The potato medley, however, were a disappointment.  It had maple sweet potatoes, parmesan red skins, and herbed fingerlings.  Note to self: maple syrup and sweet potatoes do not mix at all.

Some highlights of Glow:
- They gave us an amuse-bouche on the house (\"compliments of the chef\") that consisted of multi-grain and raisin toast with three kinds of dips/spreads: beet with ricotta, mango, and spinach.
- The server was patient and constantly came back to see if we were doing alright and to take our orders (we took forever to decide what to order plus people were running late)
- The GM came by to see if we were taken care of

Some low lights of Glow:
- They got two of our orders wrong: three of us ordered the same dish and only one came out correct (they forgot to add sauce)
- They didn't offer us dessert (servers should always ask if people want dessert)"}
{"text":"I was just there for Sunday brunch. Restaurant food is average but service level is terrible.  Restaurant staff from the Host, servers and kitchen are not working as a team.  Hostess is not trained for the job.  She just pointed to the table available for us to sit.  It was not even busy at 2:30pm!  Server was slow at coming with basic water and did not even ask us if we wanted to order drinks.  Later, when we ordered coffee it took him 15 minutes to come with it.  There were available pots in the kitchen - I saw it.  The buffet plates were wet.  Food stations were not kept clean.  
The restaurant had a good concept of serving fresh, healthy food. I've been a regular here for 3 yrs.  Unfortunately, it has lost it's vision.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"Tried this place out a couple of months ago with a girlfriend, I really liked the atmosphere but I did not like the food we ordered as it either had no taste or it wasn't cooked properly. The servers were great though as they have knowledge in their menus and are very attentive with the diners."}
{"text":"So, my sister and friend and I decided to go to Glow as a fall back because Joey's was rammed! From the outside, this place is beautiful and literally glowing. 

Once we entered, we waited for the hostess to notice us waiting and eventually had to address the hostess ourselves to be seated. Not uncommon for the hostess to be distracted so we weren't too fussed.

As we were seated, it took about 10 mins until our waiter approached us. The restaurant was fairly busy for a Wednesday night, so again, no big deal.

The problems began once we ordered our food. 

My sister ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese and a small Glow salad, I ordered the Baby Spinch salad and my friend ordered the Soup of the day and the Warm (remember this) Wild Mushroom salad. The only special request made while ordering was NO CHEESE on the Warm Wild Mushroom salad as my friend has a medium/mild dairy allergy. Simple enough order..or so we thought.

Our food arrived about 35 mins after ordering. It was so late that the manager himself brought it over. He didn't apologize, which would have been appreciated. At first, we didn't notice that my friends Warm Wild Mushroom salad hadn't arrived as she was eating her soup...which was MEH.

Once my sister and I were almost done eating our salads, we tried to flag our waiter down. He finally came over and we asked him if we would be getting the final salad. He asked us what we had ordered..seems he had forgotten. He went back to the kitchen and brought out the now Ice Cold Wild Mushroom salad WITH CHEESE. We asked him for a new one and he took the salad back to the kitchen. A few minutes later he was back at our table with the original salad..STILL with cheese on it and said there wasn't a salad without cheese in the kitchen..This sounded odd.. So instead of waiting another 30ish minutes my friend decided she would pick off as much cheese as she could and eat the now cold salad.

After we finished eating it took about another 20 minutes to get the waiter back over to get out check. Once we did get him back, he offered us each complimentary desserts. This sounded great! But of course there was a catch..there was no NON-DAIRY option. So we opted out and asked for seperate bills. 

He came back with 3 bills and didn't have the right amounts on two of the 3 bills...It seemed that this night would never end!

Needless to say..we will NOT be returning....EVER.

Conclusion
Food:
Lobster Mac and Cheese: Not bad, not great
Glow Salad: Good
Baby Spinach Salad: Really Good
Warm Wild Mushroom Salad: Good, not great
Soup of the day: Not sure, didn't try it

Service:
Actually terrible. I don't often critique so harshly, but I didn't think that the request we had made was so difficult. It would have been nice to have our waiter more available.
Side note, we each ordered a drink and had finished drinking mid way through our meals. At no point were we asked if we wanted another or a different drink.
We also had to ask the waiter to take the empty soup plate away while still eating our salads. Something small, but a service that lacked none the less.

Hopefully future Yelpers will have better luck."}
{"text":"This place is pretty horrible and I won't be coming back. We hadn't made reservations for a Saturday night and when we got to the restaurant, they told us the wait time was going to be 45 mins. It was raining outside so we didn't want to go try other places in the area so we decided to wait. Big mistake! After a few minutes, we noticed the restaurant emptying out but they still wouldn't give us a table. They didn't seem to really care about giving us a table. After 20 minutes, we inquired about the empty tables even pointing out which ones were free and then they finally seated us. 

The food came out fairly quick and we even got complimentary bread. The bruschetta we ordered was pretty good. I also ordered the shrimp linguine which was TERRIBLE and over priced. We had to keep asking the waitress to refill our water and drinks. 

My friends had the grilled calamari, lobster Mac and cheese and the bun less burger- all of which were pretty below average. 

Overall not a great experience."}
{"text":"Service was ok. Food really mediocre. Way overpriced. Nice patio though. Wouldn't come back any time soon."}
{"text":"Ugh! the portions are considerably small and the food is not great. ESP the mediteranian chicken flat bread its flavourless."}
{"text":"This is a new place in the California-style outdoor mall called Shops on Don Mills. It was a sunny Sunday afternoon and the massive patio caught my eye and was inviting enough with its sleek lines, wicker chairs, and contemporary design to get me to considering eating there. The restaurant itself aims for that uber chic and modern look and feel, but it feels a bit forced (a la Moxie's).

The food is middle of the road. I tried their mini-burgers (turkey, beef, and lamb) for an appetizer and they were well cooked yet moist and well garnished. I also had their goat cheese salad which was filling but felt a bit like what I could whip together at home as opposed to find in a trendy restaurant.

Drinks were well made but service was a bit lacking. The manner, approach, and general demeanor of the staff made it feel like service was a bit of an after thought. Still, the patio is great and definitely makes this place worth visiting again at some point.

Beware that like most establishments of this type, you will overpay for your meal by about 25% compared to what you'd expect to pay for equivalent food."}
{"text":"I came here for an early dinner with a friend and we were both disappointed. 

The atmosphere was nice and fresh and the service was fine. I got the cobb salad because nothing else on the menu looked particularly good. The salad was as good as you can expect an average cobb salad to be and came in a big portion. 

But the server kept bringing us things that we never ordered and insisted that we have them. For example, he brought us a hummus trio before our meal, which was good, but strange to bring if the table didn't order it. After our meal, he also brought us a dessert sampler that we didn't order and when he told him we didn't order it, he said he knew but wanted us to try it anyway. We asked if it was free and he said no. We were very confused and declined. Why would a restaurant bring you something you never ordered, insist you try it, and charge you for it? So strange. 

That fact alone is enough to make me avoid this place. I haven't been back since then and I don't plan on it. I won't be recommending Glow to my friends or family."}
{"text":"Horribly noisy even without any music. Don't bring anyone that you want to talk to unless this place is empty. As for the rest, food and service: So, So."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the complimentary dips that they served while waiting for the entree. I enjoyed their food, very fresh and tasty. Definitely a place to go to if you want to eat whole foods. Their decor is beautiful and they have a very nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant , although overpriced. 
Most meals lacking on sides. 
Steak is usually undercooked. 
Good blues band on Monday nights and I think they have live music at the weekend."}
{"text":"Good ambience, good food, we got the early dine in special and ordered soup and salad for starters and entrees to include: salmon spagettini and meatloaf with mashed potatoes, for desserts we opted for raspberry cheesecake and chocolate mousse. All in all, for $15 per person for early dine in this is quite the deal and i would highly recommend it!! See pictures.
Note: Don't be disappointed if your server is slow, i find the servers here are half-dazed."}
{"text":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz.....oh...what the...oh sorry, just writing about Glow and it is....*yawn*...about as exciting as.....*snore*....

*goes and gets some tea*...

Okay.  Now that I have some caffeine in my system I can write about this place which is one of the most boring and uninteresting places I have ever eaten at.  

The food is as bland as a Kelsey's or Milestones.  But the best part of it, is that you get to pay for that kind of food!  $18 for a cobb salad?!  Can you do me a favour and have the items properly diced for me instead of me doing your work for you?  Meanwhile, my wife ordered a 'dish\" of scallops for $24 on top of some coleslaw type substance.  She got 5 scallops about the size of a quarter, and about the thickness of your thumb.  

The salmon dish that my wife's friend got was just as uninteresting (and overpriced).  

I have to say that the comments about this place having slow service are extremely accurate.  It took FOREVER to get the order in.  FOREVER, to get the food and again FOREVER to pay the bill.  

Glow will be GONE (hopefully) very soon as it shouldn't be able to exist given how tough the competition is just in this area.  I fully advise that you save yourself the money and instead go eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Unfortunately there is no zero star or star dust option otherwise I would have rated it as stardust :-) 
We unfortunately had a grumpy young female host (server) that was obvious that she does not like her job and disliked the fact that our table didn't order alcoholic beverages so she could make more tips. 
The food was very mediocre in taste , nothing special , the complimentary olive oil spread and mint humus was to dry and absent of any taste , we asked for some olive oil to spike up the taste and dryness. 
Our main course the citrus shrimp salad and baked sole were alright , nothing special , the daily special soup was served in a very minimalistic way totally out of proportion with its plate. 

The most disappointing part was that literally over 3 times we had to go around the enormous space to find a server, the servers were kind of having a round table in the restaurant and were enjoying each other's company totally ignoring and forgetting about the tables and guests and when this was pointed out to them a few had a courtesy to apologize but our server just threw her head around and acted very abruptly , we were table 32 very close to the serving station and behind a partition where the staff had there important congregation in the middle of service. It was very clear that service is non existence, complacency and ignorance was abundant, and their was a lack of professional supervision  :-( 
Apologies is the first step but these days is not enough, hospitality needs to go beyond just mere apology , another example is the time we wanted to pay but the first available person out of 5 whom were busy with their important round table had to go around and find the server which is so silly and backward because she was assigned to our table, these things should not hinder another available staff member to provide service , so lack of initiative was another big missing puzzle link tonight . 

I hope that these things will be addressed very soon  , I definitely recommend the owners and staff to read the book \"setting the table\" and to watch some very interesting talks by Danny Meyers on the importance of hospitality , self initiative and guest service , which will make or break a business."}
{"text":"Terrible Service. We had to wait 15 minutes to be served(despite the restaurant being half empty). We received our meal in a timely manner after we placed the order. My wife's salmon was overcooked and luke warm. We couldn't advise the waiter as he hadn't come by our table as they normally do after the food is brought to one's table. After 30 minutes we realized his shift was over so another waiter took over. One of the staff members in management came by and offered the entree at no charge. A few minutes later the manager came by and offered us free coffee ( poor staff communication). When we received our final bill we were charged for the coffee and had to advise the server that we were offered that at no charge. She had to call the manager to confirm."}
{"text":"This place was amazing ! My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday. The hostess was kind and very attentive. Our server was amazing ! The food came out perfect. We had the best experience here ! Definitely will be coming back! Also very sweet of the hostess to remember it was my birthday on our way out wishing me happy birthday again ! You guys are great ! I would recommend this place to anyone !"}
{"text":"Much better than last time I tried this restaurant a few years ago. The service was good. The flatbreads were delicious. I ordered the miso black cod and it had no taste but the vegetable sides (rapini and brussel sprouts) were good. Everyone enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"The ambiance and decor is very nice but the food is beyond average. Ate here for my first time and I won't be returning. I got a flatbread which was very dry, kale ceaser salad with steak which was tasteless. And my husband got the veal chops with corn and mash potatoes which wasn't so bad but the veal wasn't cooked how he wanted. Server was nice though. I'd rather go to joeys or pf changs across from here."}
{"text":"Great food, service and ambiance.  Check out early dining deals if you are seated before 6. Great for movie goers at neighbouring Cineplex VIP."}
{"text":"The sour service was the only taste that lingered in my mouth after eating at Glow. For such a classy and modern atmosphere with hefty prices tags, the quality of food and service was extremely inadequate. I will never eat at Glow again.

Four of us in a 14 person group split the grilled calamari, short ribs, lobster burgers, bruschetta on flat bread and the lamb chops. The grilled calamari was soft with an olives and cappers sauce. The lamb was cooked very well with a peppery seasoning. (The reason it got 2 stars instead of one) The lobster burgers (not the real name) lacked lobster and the short ribs were probably the worst short ribs I've ever had. I've always thought that it was impossible to mess up short ribs as they're great everywhere I've eaten them, but I was dead wrong. The meat's texture mushed in your mouth as if it were boiled or made in a lab. If I hadn't built up my hunger for 1.5 hours waiting for my food to arrive I probably wouldn't have eaten it. 

After dinner we had prepared a cake which we brought in from an outside bakery. Glow charges us $2.50/person for a plating fee.. I've never heard of this before. If we knew bringing parties to Glow wasn't encouraged we never would have come. It was a slap in the face. 

After the cake and with our bills on the table we waited 45 min just to pay! And when my friend expressed her dissatisfaction to the waiter.. He swore under his breath and walked away. 

If you think this was just the luck of the draw with a bad waiter think again. As we were discussing our dinner outside, a girl who was also eating in the restaurant couldn't stop herself from jumping into the conversation to express her displeasure with Glow's service..."}
{"text":"I went there today with some friends for lunch. It is definitely well decorated and the atmosphere was relaxing! 
However the food and buffet area could do with some improvement. The containers in the buffet area were empty, the food temperature was not hot and the cupcakes seemed like they were store bought! 
Will not visit again, not sure if it has new management as I have been previously for Sunday lunch and it was fine.
Also the website is deceiving, I looked online at the lunch menu before going only to be told that it was not available. There was a separate menu but only maybe 5 things on it!"}
{"text":"Stumbled in; not on purpose.

If given the option I would have rated Glow a whopping 2.5 stars, which would have solely covered points for decor, my comfy green patio chair and the tiny shooter brownie dessert I finished the night off with (desserts always lead to points in this tummy of mine;p).

We arrived and requested seating for two on the patio.  The full house somehow prompted the hostess to advise that, \"we're full and we don't take reservations\", no problem we'll wait; \"no miss, we can't hold tables\"...hmm, I'm thinking the relationship should have just ended there lol...after 35mins we were seated (ah success!)

The menu was brief and said things like \"pomme\" instead of apple.  I had the cod fish with rice which I could have made better myself (bad news seeing I'm Chief Ramsey's polar opposite).  The waitress: I asked, what kind of rice is aztec? Her response, \"like rice\".....(no comment).  We attempted to joke with a few of the wait staff throughout the night and not one person owned a smile, or personality for that matter.  And we're gosh-darnit funny people! 

It was just all wrong with all the right potential.  Shame.  Guess that's what they get for having poor branding. \"Glow Fresh Grill\" with a tomato/onion/beet, what is that?? lol 

I would give it another shot; not soon.


**NOTE: 2nd review, ahhhh yeaaaya!** Elite? haha.."}
{"text":"We invited friends to join us on Sunday night for dinner. We stood at the entrance over 5 minutes before we were acknowledged. The waiter was pleasant but quickly lost interest when he couldn't up sell us on the wine. Three of the 4 meals were almost inedible. We all finished at about the same time but plate removal took 10 minutes from the removal of the first to the removal of the 4th ! We were not asked if we would like coffee or dessert so we paid the bill and went across the street and were served promptly and pleasantly.
We eat out often but we will not be going back to Glow !"}
{"text":"Was invited to Glow Fresh for my  friend's birthday. It was a party of 6 girls. I have to say that service was big disappointment.  They barely served our table. Not everyone got forks, we had to ask for water etc. And the restaurant wasn't busy on Sunday night. The food was good, I would say average. Will not come back."}
{"text":"Glow ruined a family birthday.  Do NOT plan special events here--or any meals for that matter.  Food was awful and service matched the food.  A summary of our complaints:

-Bread & 3 dips that they serve at beginning was STALE.  I feel like many people are complaining about this.  It's not fresh, toasted, or dried like a cracker.  You literally have to work at chewing it--absolutely disgusting.

-Chicken in club sandwich was DRY.  How does one ruin a club sandwich?!?!  Leave it to Glow.

-Lamb sandwich was dry and FLAVOURLESS.  Isn't lamb supposed to be succulent?

-Beef stir-fry sauce consisted of 2 things: soy sauce and a ton of oil.  Beef was TOUGH as hell and definitely overcooked.

-Wagyu burger was just mediocre.

-They forgot my aunt's dessert.  She waited 20 mins. for it.  Server was made aware of this, and assured us that we wouldn't be charged.  A good restaurant would have a) apologized profusely, and b) brought one out--on the house as an acknowledgement that they did not provide good service.

-We asked to order a side of fries (they serve it with the burger) to accompany our bland chicken clubs and after much consultation with the kitchen, they came back with an answer of \"no\".  Why?  Because they are portioned out ahead of time with the beef, so they didn't want to run out.  A telltale sign that this kitchen runs like an assembly line.  No passion, no flavour, everything pre-prepared.  They appear to be an upscale restaurant but are missing the food and the service that defines an upscale restaurant.

-Service was slow and too casual--both in tone and attire--for the prices they are charging."}
{"text":"Came here for a Friday night dinner.  We originally wanted to go to Joey's but the wait was 45 minutes long so ended up coming to Glow instead.  Interestingly, when we arrived at Glow, there wasn't a line up and in fact, there were quite a number of empty tables....perhaps a telling sign of what was to come? 

The waiter (who was exceptional) brought us 3 types of hummus (a carrot, beet and butternut squash) and some bread to start. The bread seemed stale and was slightly toasted so as to perhaps hide the staleness? Either way, the hummus was good....we particularly enjoyed the beet and butternut squash one but the bread could be much better.  

We ordered the grilled squid to share which came with 2 large pieces of squid.  The squid was....well, flavourless.  We felt like a lot of olive oil (at least we hope it was olive oil) was doused on top which made it quite oily and I didn't think that there was enough of a \"grilled\" flavour to the squid.  

I ordered the Wagyu beef burger which came with bbq chips and a ceasar salad.  First, I felt the burger was overdone and very dry.  It had an interesting flavour to it....not unpleasant per se, but I could have done without that spice (whatever it was) so that I could at least taste the beef.  The bbq chips were quite intricate actually and our waiter told us that it was baked in the stone oven.  Strangely, the chips seemed to be kind of oily (?) and there was no bbq flavour to them.  The ceasar salad was nothing crazy but was pretty good. 

My fiance ordered the salmon overtop a spinach salad.  The salmon was overcooked which was highly disappointing.  The spinach salad was again nothing to rave home about. 

Again, our server was fantastic and really raved about the food (which I suppose is his job).  

Overall, we spent a little over $80 dollars for less than mediocre food. Definitely not worth the money.  Glow was disappointing and overpriced and to be honest, I'd only come back here if friends suggested it AND if it was before 6pm to get in on the $15 3 course fixed price menu."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant maybe 3 times before last night, but only for lunch.  All the previous times I went, I thought the food was great and service was pretty good.  Last night, I went there for dinner for a work function, so we had a larger group (I think there were 10 or 11 people).

I have to say, although the food was pretty good, the service....meh.  We had a 5:30pm reservation, so it was not busy when we arrived, yet it seemd to take the waiter a long time to take our wine order, bring the wine, and fill up water for everyone.  Overall the service wasn't terrible, but it certainly wasn't great.

If you have eaten at Glow before, you know that there is an empahsis on healthy eating.  They do this really well, portions large enough to fill you up, keeping everything fairly fresh & healthy.  I had the cedar plank salmon with edamame & corn salad.

All in all, I would come back here for lunch (because I work close by) but I wouldn't go back for dinner...unless it was for a specific reason."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of girls tonight. The restaurant was nice looking, looks like they spent a lot of money on their decor.  It has a very relaxing atmosphere. We sat on the patio.
My friends and I ordered different things from the menu. I ordered the basa filet, the presentation was nice and the portion was good, however when I started eating it, it was not flaky at all, in fact it was hard because it was raw.  I sent it back with the waitress and had to wait about 15min to get the same fish back but now cooked.  I was not impressed!!! When my cooked meal finally go to the table my friends were almost done eating their meal.  My meal was definitely not worth the wait, it was bland, flavourless and nothing to write home about.  

I give glow a 1 star because the restaurant looked nice.  I will not go back and would not recommend to friends, unless they are into bland food."}
{"text":"One would think - being part of the Shops at Don Mills - service might be part of the experience. While it was somewhat busy when myself and several friends -- and some of their children -- went, it wasn't super busy. This was the first time I was there: chaos. Everyone looked and acted disorganized. Once we did get seated, and that took too long, our wait for the 'waiter' was absurdly long (interestingly, the man who got us our drinks and eventually delivered the food said he wasn't the waiter). Definitely - poor - service. Perhaps a bad night? It happens. I'm not a demanding customer. Far, far from it.

On the plus side, the food was excellent. The beet/walnut salad I had was super."}
{"text":"Just a really strange experience. The decor is bizarre with leather belts holding up the back cushions on the banquettes and giant sandworm-looking things all over the ceiling. The bathroom felt like it was 10 miles away, deep in the basement and was filthy by the end of the evening when we were there. 
I ordered a Honkers Ale and it arrived in what felt like a very small \"pint\" glass. I asked the waiter if it was supposed to be a pint. He said yes, a British pint. The glass wasn't filled, he offered to top it up, then came back and corrected himself - not a British pint, just a 16oz pint. I gotta say - I've had a lot of pints in my day and this felt small in my hand. Maybe my hands have grown? I tasted the beer and it was gross. I've had the honkers ale before and it did NOT taste like this. I sent it back and then notice they had Boneshaker on the menu. I asked if it was on tap or in a bottle. The waiter said tap, then came back to correct himself. Bottle. I said no thanks. He urged me to try it. I said no - I'd had it many times before, but didn't want a bottle. Again he urged me to have it and I shut him down. Why was he insisting?? The food was OK. I had the super-oniony bruschetta and the \"Super Bowl\" salad. Canned mandarin oranges in it. Such an odd choice of ingredients, but whatever. The mud pie was fine. 
A busser came to ask if he could clear the table, reeking of cigarettes, and then said \"well, since I can't reach your dishes, I guess I'll just do it later\". What? We moved the dishes toward him and he said we were soooo kind. I told him we could take a hint, wasn't exactly an act of kindness. He didn't understand what I meant and said \"no, no, you can stay as long as you want, I just have to clear the table by the end of the night, so might as well do it now\". So odd! 

So overall, I will not return. The service was unbelievably slow, the waiter was very confused, the busser was very strange, the pint was not 16oz in my view and the food was just *fine*. I do NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"Visited numerous times and yes the atmosphere is the best part but I also enjoy the food that is much healthier than the bars around. Had the veggie burger on my last visit and it was the best veggie burger I've ever had. Finally a burger with grains (not soy) that is very filling and delicious. I love that they allow for substitutions of the sides. Got the glow salad and it was great. My mom had the regular burger but didn't enjoy it as much because it was a little bland for her (maybe too lean). Perhaps if you want a nice fatty burger, this may not be the place for you. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend, third time here and every time I give it a try I'm not impressed with the food. Had their flatbread, it was ok. Had their soup, nothing special. Had their cheese and meat platter, its was ok. The last time was the worse I had their burger stuffed with brisket, it was soooo dry I forced myself to eat as much as I can to avoid wasting my money as it wasn't cheap! Had zero sauce in it which made it even more dry. 

My friend had salad with shrimp and she said hers wasn't bad so maybe only some of their food is okay?  Not sure."}
{"text":"A group of us 6 went there last Saturday night and sat on the patio.  I've been here 2x before for lunch and service was usually good and so was the food (perhaps because it wasnt as busy???)  This Sat night was very busy thus the service was slooooow. The waiter came with our drinks quickly but then disappeared for a while before taking our dinner orders.  The flatbread brushetta was good, as was the lobster mac n cheese.  The steak was flavourless, had to add so much salt and pepper!  The bunless turkey burger was meh....I could've made it better at home, the patty was overcooked.  All in all it was an OK experience...I will choose other restaurants in this plaza before going here again."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch this past weekend, great place for brunch.  Food was plenty and the place was decorated nicely.  Service was not the greatest, but I was chatting away with my girls so it did not bother me at the time."}
{"text":"Decoration/Atmosphere- Pretty and Modern, it's really nice when you sit at the patio in the summer, the seating can be tight, and relatively loud. 

Food: I've been there a couple of times, I find their entrees tend to be too salty. I tried the Lobster and Mac and Cheese (I believe what it's called) was too salty. During the summer time, they have tuna tataki or a seared Tuna Steak and it was really good however, they don't serve it during in the winter. For dessert, they have mini cups of  cake/pudding/mousse and they are pretty good.

Service: It really depends on who's working. There are really nice, polite, and efficient waiters and also some rude ones. The waitstaff was not very nice. I was actually really disappointed. Our guest were late for the table, however, no matter what, employees should never give weird looks on their faces. They were somewhat rude. 

Price: It's pretty desent for the food you get. I think it's a little bit cheaper than Joey's however, I think Joey has better food and service quality."}
{"text":"This place isn't as bad as everyone is making it out to be. I had a great time last night. My server was awesome. She was super sweet and and very personable and really attentive. I started out with the lobster Mac and cheese which was absolutely delicious. I wish they served it as an entree. I could eat that all day everyday! For my main meal I had the 5 grain burger which was good, nothing spectacular. I found it a bit on the dry side. I think it would be better if they added more tahini sauce to it as there was just a tiny drizzle of it on my plate. Ended my meal with the seasonal fruit crumble, which was just perfect. Super light and delicious. I loved the complimentary bread and dips served to the table. The olive bread and artichoke dip were my faves. Ambiance is gorgeous! Had an overall good time, definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Disappointing overall.. My friend ordered the lobster mac and cheese and couldn't eat more than a few bites. I had the veggie burger, which was essentially a large bunless falafel that was WAY too salty. A few positives: our servers were very pleasant and the mini desserts were delish. Don't think I'll be back though, as it was way overpriced for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Earlier this year, my friend phoned me up randomly on a Sunday morning and said he'd be driving in from Hamilton that day so we should do brunch. Well, all the usual places I go to for brunch are downtown so I went about looking for a place that was a little closer to home - and decided on Glow.  It's a nice place with a beautiful, chic decor and their brunch prices were reasonable ( although edging towards the slightly overpriced side). I've since forgotten what we ate, but we started with Mimosa's (called Morning Glory's on the menu) and ended with their cute little dessert shots.

I came back this past weekend for a family brunch. I had an aunt visiting from L.A. and she is very particular about trying to eat organic, healthy and fresh so I made a reservation for us here. I booked online using OpenTable and the hostess was expecting us when we arrived and greeted  us warmly.

In our party we ordered the following:

Appetizers:
Tomato-Basil Soup: simple, exactly what you'd expect. Not too salty; served with a small slice of baked flatbread with melted cheese.
Grilled calamari: nice alternative to the usual fried stuff. Served with lots of greens & olives bits.

A complimentary Amouse Bouche was brought to the table for us to share. It consisted of house-baked toast with 3 dips: an olive tapanade, hummous and sundried tomato.

Mains:
Philly Cheesesteak Open-Faced Sandwich - hubby devoured this in 5 minutes, so I'll take that as a sign that it was good.
Veal Parmigiana sandwich 
Lobster Mac & Cheese - a bit boring, good bits of lobster in it though.
Stir-fried beef with noodles - a huge bowl of noodles with lots of vegges (and beef or chicken depending on what you choose).

There was nothing outstanding about any of the dishes, yet nothing to complaing about either. I liked that everything was served with a lovely fresh salad.

For dessert all of us had one of their dessert shots - the ones I remember are Smores, Lemon Meringue, Strawberry Cheesecake, Pecan Caramel Cheesecake, Chocolate Mint Mousse, 3-chocolate Mousse. All of them are quite sweet so it's a good thing they are small!

In the summer their patio is open with lots of seating facing a little grassy court. The washrooms and a private bookable dining room are located downstairs, accessible by elevator. I really like that there's a hands-free sensor to open the washroom door (so you don't  have to touch it after washing your hands!). I didn't find service to be slow, but to be honest I was busy chatting away with friends I hadn't seen in a while.

Overall it was a lovely time out, a nice leisurely meal and if the occasion was right, I would come back here."}
{"text":"First time at Glow. Friendly staff but the service was not so good.
We had ordered steak , bunless burgers and Asian style black cod with veggies. 
They seems to be very busy and they had to sit us at a lounge which was very loud and noisy. Took us a while to flag a waiter down to take our order and bring us some water at least. It took over 45 minutes to serve the food and the waitress only said \"sorry were busy and held back with the orders\" (?) 
The food that we got was somewhat cold and very very salty and both burger and steak were dry. The gish however was bland and no taste at all. We asked the waitress to assist however no help from her,  as it was busy..so we just ate and left. 

Overall ok, but I wouldn't go back again as I did not see any prompt and professional services from them. Seems they are very unorganized when they get busy."}
{"text":"Service was not up to par.  Our server handed a plate to my friend but forgot to tell her that the plate was hot.  She almost burnt herself.  Then, no one came around to check whether things were ok after we got our food.  A couple of servers brought food that we didn't order to our table.  My friend ordered an Americano but got a cup of steamed milk.  One of our bowls, kettles and a spoon were not clean.  Then our bills got mixed up.  As we were walking out of the restaurant at the end of the night, we walked pass at least 3 servers and none of them said good night or even fake a smile."}
{"text":"What a dissapointing experience it was. So much for the great ambience and patio seating the food was absolutely terrible. I had the Linguine which was basically pasta with 4-5 pieces of shrimp, few pieces of sun dried tomatoes, some black olives and a sauce that was very watery. My 12 year old cousin can make this at home and it would taste much much better. There was absolutely no flavor, seasoning and it didn't warrant the price or ambience. My friends ordered the veg burgher and to their surprise it was a deconstructed version with naan bread and some lentil based cake and tomatoes on the side. Please don't call it a burgher. Its simply badly made naan and curry. The service was good. But I am really sorry you guys need to up the game on the food."}
{"text":"We had to go here because the restaurant adjacent to it (Joeys) was at capacity and we had no reservations, so we thought to give it a try. I must say first off the bat that the service was not even near close to what you would expect at any restaurant. We were seated promptly but waited a very long time to get our orders taken, a longer time to get food, and also for the bill. We had to literally get the supervisor to help us out.

Food was OK. not great for the price. I went safe and ordered a burger, however, nothing really special or satisfying about it.

If I was in the area and Joey's was packed, I would probably head back to Jack Astors for dinner rather than here. On an off chance, we might have caught them in a bad time, but it will be some time before I give them another shot."}
{"text":"First time I came to this place was back when it first opened.  Thought that the atmosphere was nice and very suitable to its location.  The food however, was a disappointed.  So I wasn't really expecting much during my last visit but I'm happy to say that I was utterly surprised with the quality of their food.  With my first experience, I found the food to be quite bland and way overpriced for its quality.  The prices I guess now, is pretty acceptable.

Grilled Calamari with Chorizo Sausage - Made with parsley pesto, kalamata olives and cherry tomatoes.  This was what made our visit.  Calamari was grilled to perfection and the chorizo complimented it very well.  It was just bursting with flavour.  Great way to start off your meal or even have this as your meal, as the portion was quite generous (2 of us shared the app).  5/5.

Ahi Tuna Club - I'm a sucker for ahi tuna anything so when I see this on the menu, chances are I'll order it.  Was however, disappointing.  2/5."}
{"text":"Good salad good bread very bad pasta no sauce no taste just boiled pasta and boiled shrimps.  staff with attitude when we mention that food is not good and totally ignoring out comment. Don't go"}
{"text":"Went to Glow on a Friday night with 8 girls for a girls night out. 

The only upsides were the atmosphere and drinks. The resto is stunning and the martinis are tops.

The downsides are food and service. Being first time there, our large group asked for recc from our server. She suggested the Thai bowl (which bombed) , the veal scallopini  and surf n turf ( both were subpar - veal was lacking flavour and steaks were overdone, none of the three orders for surf n turf were cooked to the requested doneness). The desserts we opted for were these $3 mini cakes, which presented well but no matter which cake you ordered, all tasted the same. So, bad recc from the server and plates were taken away before we were finished the food. 

Tried once, will be really hesistant to back for an actual meal or chedule a group thing there. We all agreed that the Joey's across the street would have given us a better night, but we wanted to give the non-chain a chance."}
{"text":"Friendly service, food was good and reasonable price. Live music was a plus but a tad too loud for the space."}
{"text":"Nice area, you'd think it would be as good as PF Changs or something. They claim to be healthy but the food is super stale.  Nothing is \"fresh\" as it was probably yesterday's food.  Stale bread, dry pasta, soggy brushchetta.  Never returning.  Oh yeah, and it's overpriced on their fancy menu.  Don't let the ambiance fool you."}
{"text":"Is it possible to screw up a brunch buffet?  If you want to know what that's like, come to Glow.  They can't get the basics right.  Peameal bacon:  dry and flavorless.  Sausage:  dry and hard. Scrambled eggs:  overcooked and dry.  Roasted potatoes:  dry.  Smoked salmon:  ok.  Salads: 
 ok.  It looks like they bake everything in trays and just serve them that way, and it sits there under a flame for hours.  The only good thing came from the omelette station where it's made on the spot for you, and the fruit.  Hard to screw up fruit though.  You're just paying for the decor, there's much better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"The third restaurant I've visited at Shops on Don Mills, and the third one that had a problem with honouring my reservations. Pretentiousness, or just incompetence? The bloody place was near empty at 10pm on a Saturday night, what the hell was the problem?

So we ended up sitting by the bar, which I immediately saw as the best position throughout the entire first floor, but had to convince my friend so..it was her birthday after all. 
So we gather three cruiser tables by the bar, and it turned out great.
Everyone ordered drinks, and they had a fair selection to choose from.
Only one other person was willing to share the wine with me (by willing I mean I told that she was drinking with me), and she left it to me to pick out something \"not too dry.\" If I fail this simple task, I'll never forgive myself.
Thankfully, the cellar had exactly what I was looking for, South American Red. Perhaps the most overlooked gem of all wine connoisseurs. Wine from that region sells for dirt at the LCBO, which is met with no complaint from me. The bottle I ordered was very well received, and my ego went ever-upward.

The waiter came with these mini dessert puddings in shot glasses, priced at three dollars each. I was disappointed with the New York Raspberry Cheese Cake, but very happy with the Dolce something something. 
I went downstairs to use the restrooms, nothing special. That is until I saw the private dining room. It was so colourful, crisp, and ridiculously contemporary. It was bloody gorgeous, and made the traditionalist in me feel dirty for admiring such a marble of a room. And it was spacious too. I might just have to plan something there in the near future.

Not romantic, shrewd maybe. I'd come here again."}
{"text":"The sharables were very small, not exactly sharable. Must order in quantity without the quality. Food came with great presentation. Instagram worthy?  but not for real foodies.

Waitress also billed pricing not as `special` pricing. Didnt see the proper pricing of items until you paid, as they shove the machine to you faster then you can look at the listing. Beware and check your  bill."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday breakfast buffet. $18.99 per person plus $3 for tea or coffee.

The restaurant was packed. We actually made reservations but when we came in the part for brunch that was not necessary as it was usually only half full. We hasn't visited n almost two years so I'm not sure when the budget menu was added but I think it seemed to be doing well as it was -30 outside and it was busy. 

The buffet itself was okay. Scramble eggs and French toasts plus brisket and salmon two way, baked and smoked. Fruit platters, mini desserts, a veggie pasta dish, roasted potatoes and peameal bacon and turkey sausages. The bacon and sausages were cold and tough. We didn't finish what we took. The baked salmon was cold, actually everything was cold even the French toast and roasted potatoes. The French toast was a whole grain bread, so it was good. The potatoes were tasty. The brisket was the winner! It was warm and very tasty, not salty and very tender.

The omelette station is what we enjoyed the most. There were about 8 items to choose from for your made to order omelette. The cook was good at managing all the orders but we waited and went there was no one there. I got mushrooms, ham and cheese omelette. 

Service was good. Our waiter was friendly and attend give despite it being busy. We asked for a coffee refill and he was very pleasant, sometimes when a restaurant is busy the wait staff make you feel as though you're inconviencing them, but not here.

For the amount you're spending, $22 per person is not bad for the buffet. The food is good and I'm sure if we went earlier it would be better as it would be fresh."}
{"text":"I was at Glow Fresh Grill on Saturday night on a double date. We wanted to go somewhere to enjoy drinks on a patio.

I have to say I love the outdoor space; the comfortable seating, beautiful banana trees, and the live music on Friday nights.

The drinks are nice too, especially the mixed drinks but not many (if any) beers on tap. 

We ordered the grilled calamari, and though I've had it last summer with yummy capers and olives... This time the ingredients changed and my mouth was on fire because of the chilli sauce. We sent it back, and our waiter said that it had been happening a lot. Maybe time to change the recipe back?

The oysters were very fresh, I enjoyed them immensely. The presentation was beautiful too.

The service was also good.

This is my third time here, and I can say that I do not enjoy the food as much as the atmosphere. If you like to have drinks in a nice place try it out... But don't come here if you're looking to tickle your taste buds."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant. The decor is stunning. I went for a late lupper(lunch/supper) around 4ish. The place was dead. The server that was working was evidently very new to the food service industry. The food was nice just verrryyyyy sssllllooooowwww. The owner came over to our table at the end of our meal with a tray of desserts. He was a great sales men and the dessert that I otherwise wouldn't have gotten was fabulous

Food
Satay platter- 3/5 kind of dry
grilled calamari- 2/5 I asked for lemon on the side which came after it the calamari had long gone cold
Teriyaki salmon- 4/5
Lamb shank - 4/5

repeat- not likely"}
{"text":"This review is for the $15 3 course early bird special. It was great. Lots of selection and there's something for everyone! We were 3 adults and 1 toddler. For the starter we had soups and salad. We each chose a different main and I think there were 4 to choose from. Dessert was a little shot glass cheesecake or mousse, and I believe there were 8 different choices. $5 Caesars on Sunday! The little guy had a cheesy flatbread and drink. Flavours were really good, and portion was sufficient but a bit smaller than what you'd usually get when dining out. Washrooms are clean but kind of a bummer that you have to go down a steep flight of stairs or take the very slow elevator."}
{"text":"Came here this past Saturday for dinner and the place wasn't super busy.  We made reservations, but didn't need to.

The decor in the atmosphere is quite unique and the lights on the ceiling of the restaurant change colour.  I didn't find it anything special, but can appreciate the uniqueness that no other restaurant has this.  The seating is rather casual.... booth seating or just tables and chairs in the middle of the restaurant.  We didn't get a chance to sit at the patio but it was quite busy there so I'm assuming it was good.

I started with a raspberry mojito which was AMAZING!   it was fresh, delicious, and gave me a slight buzz which dissipated after a few pieces of flatbread :(

The menu appeared to have a health focus as there was an abundance of veggies to choose from.  We started with the Mediterranean flatbread which was amazing!  I'm not usually a flatbread fan, but they did a superb job with this one.  It was crunchy, flavourful and had a lot of toppings.  It was $15 and could probably pass for an entree for someone with a smaller/normal sized appetite.

For entree I had the cod, roasted cauliflower and Brussels sprouts.  The veggies were very well done and quite delicious but a touch on the oily and salty side.  The fish however was not that great.  Perhaps I've been spoiled by my experience at Lee, but i thought the fish was a bit dense, tough, and fishy.  I don't think I'd order it again.  

Overall I had a positive experience at this restaurant and would probably come back for the excellent raspberry mojito alone !"}
{"text":"service: 1/10, our server did not know the basics of customer service. He is not rude, he just doesn't know how to serve. Lack of training... 

Food: 7/10: I ordered Ravioli shrimp which was good 

The restaurant is very noisy. you can hear the servers cleaning dishes and moving the utensils around... 

I do not recommend Glow.Not a good experience. for the same budget, there are much better places."}
{"text":"The previous ratings aside, my experience couldn't have been more different and positive. The food was perfectly cooked (grilled squid was perfect and lamb shank was fall off the bone excellent). 

Staff consisted of 4 people helping at our table and nothing was missed and no one was less than friendly. 

Wine was half price to boot on Mondays. I'm not sure I was in the same place as the rest of these reviewers, but the location and restaurant  name seem to match. 

I'll be going back without any doubts."}
{"text":"Service was pretty slow to be honest, and noticed our waitress was wearing jeans?? Just didn't seem professional to me, especially with the decor of that place, maybe I'm wrong? 

Anyway, ordered the lobster mac and cheese, chorizo calamari, and the americano pizza. Even though we ordered 2 appetizers first and a pizza, they all came at the same time -__- should one even be called an appetizer if it's coming at the same time as the main course...? The lobster mac n cheese was so tiny I don't even know how it took so long. 

The lobster mac and cheese was pretty tasty. The grilled calamari with fried chorizo was quite good, but the pizza was too salty to my liking, and I attribute that to the capocollo. 

I really wanted to order their crème brûlée here, but I was so scared that it was going to take an hour just to even try it so I just took the rest of the pizza to-go, and called it a night. I really wanted to like this place and was really feeling the décor, but this place was definitely a miss for me."}
{"text":"Here it comes. My first bad review.

One star for ambience, its a nice place to hang out - but let's just hope you only intend to order drinks and not food! 

I've been here twice. The first visit was... meh .. oookay-ish. Ordered some sort of noodles with seafood cant remember the name now - but that was ok. 

Bu what kinda chocolate fondue barely has any chocolate?! We had to dig deep to get a small dip

The second time only for appetizers. Bad experience
The crab cakes seemed like they were sitting outside for 2 days. Cold, old , chewy and tasteless
The mozarella with mushrooms was soggy and disgusting. You could tell frozen mushrooms were dumped into a microwave or something. I barely ever find food so repulsive that I decide not to take another bite. 

Not to mention the drinks were watery too 

Will I be back by my own will - probably not."}
{"text":"The ambiance in this place is pretty chill except that the place consisted of elderly people which explains alot of the quality and service of this place. No offense but I shouldn't have ate here after seeing it. 

I ordered the italian sausage rigatoni and it just taste like a microwave dinner that has been reheated in the pan. It just tasted bland and for 15$, a rip off. Also I thought my server mistaken my order for some other pasta dish which at first doesn't remotely look like rigatoni and more like pasta with tomato sauce. 

I don't know if the server has the right to touch other's people food but when I asked my server that my rigatoni doesn't seem to have sausages in them, he just picked up a fork from a empty desk next to me and was tempering with it. And then he said that its grounded sausage even though it taste more like ground beef. Usually its his job to bring it back to the kitchen but it just felt he was humiliating me for being dumb. 

The good thing is that they have drink specials, five days a week and today it was $5 for beer.

Damnit.. why did I had to tip that son of a bitch....."}
{"text":"There yesterday with my Mom for brunch. As with many of the reviews here already, I found it to be a lively(as in loud) pleasant experience. The food was quite good as was the service (even though it was a bit slow). The weather was crappy yesterday, but I would definitely return on a pleasant day to try the patio but I'd have to watch my liquid intake as....
.... Only one MAJOR flaw for me... The washrooms are on a different level and I did not see an elevator for walkers/wheelchairs! In addition to my own, I counted at least 8 others using walkers, but I did ask about accessibility when I booked. Man! It was a looooong drive home to Waterloo."}
{"text":"Only if they had good food! This is a very nice chilled place for a brunch or dinner during the summer. It's a nice mall and good view with patio seating. There's jazz on Sunday afternoon.

The overall ambiance in the patio section is very good. Comfortable seating, clean, and good view. However the food just wasn't good. They started with canned jams and bread and it tasted like regular supermarket jam, actually low quality regular supermarket jam. I had a pasta dish and it wasn't good, I could have done better myself.

The service was okay but the way the staff dressed did not match the high end feel of the restaurant.

Overall food was below average but great place to relax, take a date, or listen to jazz on a Sunday afternoon.

Food 1.6/5
Service 3.8/5
Ambiance 4.7/5
Value 3/5

Overall 2.7"}
{"text":"The service was good at Glow. The ambience was nice. Unfortunately the food was brutal. 

The calamari was like rubber. It looked nice in the picture, but I would stay away from this one. 
The tuna in my ahi tuna salad was under seasoned and it wasn't  fresh. They were quick to offer me something else, so I had the kale salad with shrimp. The shrimp was good, but the kale was bitter.
The black cod was extremely bland.
The small cheesecakes are okay. Really nothing special.

I think Glow probably gets a lot of the overflow from the better restaurants in the Don Mills shops. The food feels like they're not even trying."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last night and we had an okay experience.

For starters, they have a gluten free bread they will bring you if you are gluten free. The bread they brought out was really good! In fact, my boyfriend liked the gluten free bread more than the bread he was served. 

We decided to order the tuna poke bowl and the steak salad to share. The poke bowl was not up my alley. It tasted like the guacamole and the fish was infused with wasabi. It was way too spicy for me. I also discovered the fish had cucumber or pickles in it (this wasn't listed on the menu) and I began to bloat shortly after I ate it since I am cucumber intolerant. 

The steak salad was much better but it tasted just average. The steak was cooked medium like we asked but the salad had hardly any flavour. I liked how the dish came with artichokes and potatoes. The artichokes were great and the potatoes were cooked well. I was actually wishing for some ketchup so I could pretend they were fries. 

The waitress brought us bowls to share our salad and my bowl was dirty. I know this can happen if there was food left on the plate when it went into the dish washer but I really wasn't impressed. 

All over, I don't think I would return to Glow again. The line was the shortest of the restaurants in the area and the ambiance wasn't the best."}
{"text":"After reading my review, the General Manager took the time to respond politely and professionally to me. He offered to provide a better experience the next time I came around. I thought that was really nice and I appreciate the gesture. I hope they can take the feedback to the kitchen and provide a better experience for future diners."}
{"text":"my review is just for the sunday brunch buffet. This place is super cute with nice decor, def a good date spot.  Weird note - our waiter came to change our cutlery twice, which never happens at buffets so that was a nice touch.  But then he would disappear and not come back for awhilee, so I'm almost thinking do you want us to stop eating or something?

Anyway highlights
-salad station was great with lots of choice and variety for a small buffet line.  Their maple balsamic dressing is AMAZING.  drenched my salad
- the omelette station. they give u a small bowl and you can pick and add which ingredients you want in it.  The bowl is kinda small though.  bonus u can choose egg whites
-salmon.  this was fantastic! did not expect fish to be good at a buffet but it was moist and the dill sauce on the side was heavenly. so so good!

Everything else was really not that good.  potatoes and the french toast were hard/dry, pasta was salty and the chicken in it was dry, scrambled eggs and the turkey sausage were horrid.  The dessert selection was a few cupcakes which were all pretty nasty minus the carrot cake one.  Lastly, there was a good fruit platter but they never refilled it and instead kept filling up the second one with just watermelon. lame."}
{"text":"i was there for my 2nd time tonight and i find the service wonderful. last time i was there in november, i was skeptical but it was at the recommendation of a mentor i had. the food is light, it's fresh, and for me, worth every dollar. 

the grilled calamari has 3 big pieces and it's perfectly cooked. the tomatoes and pea sprouts really accent the flavours. my personal favourite is the shrimp linguine. i can't wait to come back to dine on the patio. 

their clientele is for those who enjoy fresh, light & healthier fare. it is not, i repeat, NOT for those who are accustomed to the \"greasy spoon\" types of places. if you're a fan of the rich, hearty, greasy spoon types of dishes, trust me--you're in the wrong place."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend who's complete vegetarian with high hopes. We didn't read reviews before going. 

The food wasn't great. We ordered a veggie burger and beef stir fry substituted with tofu. 

The veggie burger didn't have enough spices and broke really easier. Also note that the veggie burger is not a normal burger with buns, which we were surprised about. Instead it was just the patty, made with chick peas and two pita breads and a handful of salad. It came to 17$. 

The stir fry had way too much soy sauce and tasted too salty. I could only have a couple of bites. They had a good large portion size, but for the taste it wasnt worth the 20. 

The staff were friendly (kinda confused when we asked for veggie options), and the place itself was beautiful. Just wish their food and prices were better."}
{"text":"Checked it out with my boyfriend for our second anniversary! It was a modernized bar and restaurant with interesting interior designs.

We sat at a booth and was served right away. The waiter was polite helpful and friendly. 

I ordered a gnocchi cream pasta which was devine. The creamy gnocchi was creamy flavorful and rich. The gnocchi had grapes in it too. It balanced the heaviness of the sauce. I also got the Wednesday special Oyster for a dollar. Very nice and very fresh. 

Glow is definitely a restaurant that incompases fusion and mixing non traditional ingredients. If you are looking for something new and is feeling a bit adventurous maybe Glow would be a good choice!"}
{"text":"The salads are okay - the mains were reminiscent of the days when I would get a meal on an airplane - they tasted like they had been prepared, frozen, thawed and heated - except for the pasta - but that is based on the way they tasted, not any knowledge. The server was friendly and the best part of the experience. The room is attractive and seating is a bit tight in the booths - choose a table. The prices are as expected - except a pot of water with a Red Rose tea bag is $4. I keep going back and hoping things will be better but they stay the same. There are a surprising number of restaurants in this shopping plaza that has very few stores you would shop at. So people come for restaurants and many choose Glow - it will stay as it is - think of it as the Pickle Barrel's branch that serves old-time airline food in a very attractive space."}
{"text":"Second time dining at this establishment over the past year and I've been thoroughly impressed on BOTH occasions.  Wowed actually.  Occasion was a birthday and we were a table of 8.  Ordered a vegetarian omelette for Sunday brunch and food was gorgeously plated, portions were generous, taste was fresh and delicious AND it was nutritiously healthy - I know as I consulted the website's nutrition info before/during ordering!  Love how the restaurant really adheres to its motto of fresh and healthy ingredients.  

Appetizers and entrees were served quickly.  Love the complimentary bread with trio dip; trio dip was awesome as usual.  Service was quick and friendly.  Decor is bright and modern and you really feel comfortable here; even the washrooms are lovely!  I really have only kind words for this restaurant as everything about this dining experience was fantastic.  I especially love that I was able to reserve through my OpenTable iPhone app and earn points; convenient and beneficial.  Will definitely continue to dine here any occasion I can!  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with some friends for a late lunch after my friend tried on some wedding dresses. The ambiance is very pretty, you can tell lots of work was put into the look of this restaurant with lots of small details. I came onto Yelp to see what rating it had after the fact as my experience wasn't the greatest! I was not surprised to see the 2.5 rating. I ordered the Thai beef salad as it sounded yummy with lots of ingredients and a peanut satay dressing, udon noodles, mango and lots of other ingredients including beef tenderloin. The dressing was really good....if it wasn't completely drenched in it - way too much! The beef was not tender but more so really chewy with fatty bits in it. Overall I liked the fact that it had so many different things in it, but was not impressed...especially at the price and what seemed like was supposed to be a fancy schmancy place at Shops at Don Mills. Not worth it, I most likely will not go back."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with friends. Esthetically it's a nice restaurant. The staff was very friendly. We started with crab cakes and the grilled octopus. The octopus was very good, tender and flavourful. The crab cakes weren't very good. They tasted fishy, and the portion size was tiny for the price. For the main we all partook in the glow grill board which includes steak, chicken, chorizo sausage, and lamb shank. It also comes with potatoes and grilled asparagus. The steak and sausage were pretty good, but the chicken needed some help from the condiments provided. The lamb shank was tender and fall off the bone, but unfortunately bland. The grilled asparagus was tasty and grilled to perfection, but the potatoes were lacking in taste. 
The food was ok. Not the worst, not the best. A little overpriced."}
{"text":"This is north of the city at Shops@Don mills.

It is health driven food. So maybe the lack of positive reviews rely on people who need more fulfilling by means of carbs/fats/etc meals.

I found the food here great. Brunch on the weekend is absolutely delicious, live jazz music too!  I organized a friends going away brunch here, everyone had positive reviews.

This is food for a health conscious set of people, not for heavy feeding frenzies.

The decor and set up is beautiful, and if you can get here in the summer time, the patio is nice in the evening.

The price is mid to high, but your paying for the whole get up, and they seem to be big on the organic, simple, local food done gourmet style.

The service was quite slow when I went on a dinner date, but for brunch the waiter was extremely attentive, and I always love wen there is no fuss with bill splitting - which he did.

I would be back for brunch definitely. Not sure about dinner."}
{"text":"Great fresh food and terrific service! Highly recommend the grilled calamari. It was cooked to perfection. Plenty of gluten free options too! All around great dining experience. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"***Review for July 9th, 2015 for Brunch

-Service is equivalently as bad as Joeys but the food is worse here

-We only saw our server (PAVEL) twice, once at the beginning and once when it came to the bill. When we got our bill is when we discovered our servers name cuz he never introduced himself to us at all

-We saw the food runners and bussers more often than the server, and I think they were more deserving of the tip, as our server never came to check up on us, deliberately distanced himself from us, and pretended not too see us? Maybe because my colleagues and I were Asian...and he thought we weren't going to tip. 

-Crabcakes were bland, dry and tasted the same as the frozen department of a supermarket

-Hummus was decent and didn't really taste anything special

-Had the Mediterranean chicken flat bread, the flat bread was stale and tasted like cardboard, and the topping was like if you were constructing your own bruschetta at Frankie Tomato but much worse

-Wish I could follow up with the server, but again he was nowhere to be seen. Only saw the food runners and bussers but they looked busy so I didn't want them to handle the situation of which a server should be doing

-Had the 10oz grilled striploin medium rare, color was right, steak was bland, the sauce was bland, and the contrast with the Brussels sprouts was gross. Again the server was nowhere present

-Coffee was probably the best thing on the menu I had, light roast and tasty however I had it at the beginning of my meal and as usual the server was nowhere present so....I ended up with no refill midway through my appetizer all the way to the bill

-Skipped on desserts as the whole experience was total garbage with both the food and service

-The bill was brought extremely fast to our table, again no mention of how our meal was. I didn't even get to look at the bill and was asked cash or credit

Damage was $115 with an undeserving 15% tip to the server, if I could I would rather give the bussers and food runners the tip instead. This fed 3 with no drinks except one coffee

Didn't want to address to the manager as I felt there isn't really much of a reason to come back

Repeat? DEFINATELY NO 

Overall I will never come back, the food was terrible, the server Pavel was garbage. All the negative comments are pretty accurate, if you are goin to eat in the area just go to Joeys instead service might be almost as terrible but the food is at least decent"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by any of the atmospheric \"qualities\" or affirmative jargon used by GLOW; it's a sham.  A deception.  A total crock of shit.  Not even steaming shit--

NOTHING about this restaurant could produce steam, heat, or anything that sizzles. It isn't hot, it definitely isn't cool, it's useless.

The food was inedible.  
The service unfriendly.  
The decor did not match.  
I smelled awful when I left.  

That is to say, I smelled like the food fried by their chef on the other side of the plated glass that separated us, and like I said, it smelled, looked, and tasted like shit even though the menu made everything sound so delicious, healthy, and tantalizing. If I didn't know any better, I would have thought an amateur started this place on some sort of drunken whim.  Why go out of your way to be CHIC if you're going to dress your staff in over sized, horizontally striped button-down shirts that bunch up above hideous jeans and tiny aprons???  Every server I encountered there was hostile, disheveled, and fucking UGLY. 

I went with a party of seven last night, mostly comprised of family members in their sixty to seventies who like to dress well and have fun.  I'm 25.  We like to drink wine, eat good food, and enjoy each others company.  This place was working against all best intentions. Of the three things I ordered, none were edible.  Neither were the items my uncle ordered, nor my mum.  Nor my nana.  We are not foodies.  We are not even picky eaters.  But when I order a crab cake, especially in an environment which gives off the impression of being 'chic,' 'modern,' and 'healthy,' I don't expect it to taste like pre-revolution era bread.  After the first bite my mum and I both sent our orders back--almost apologetically so.  The server, a melancholy girl who I could barely hear and who didn't smile the entire evening, took fifteen minutes to return and push another starter on us.  I chose the grilled calamari this time.  Guess what?!  It sucked too!  It was so chewy I couldn't even cut it!  I could barely chew it.  I had to chew it like cud!  Like a fucking cow.  UM? Then my cobb salad arrives.  It might as well have been cole slaw.  The \"chicken breast\" was a slab of mummified meat resembling chicken.  I couldn't eat it.  Couldn't possibly!!  My uncle's \"Shrimp linguini\" would have tasted better if it was made  by Chef Boyardie.  What is wrong with these fucking people?  

Then they had the audacity to be fucking rude to us!  And not wait on us!  

Oh, sorry, all your \"cool\" clientele are fucking tools in t-shirts, baseball caps, and imitation Armani.

GLOW IS NOT A RESTAURANT.  IT'S NOT EVEN A CAFETERIA.  
I WOULD RATHER EAT AT IKEA.
Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Not much food variety. Decent alternative to avoid long waiting lists on weekends. Give it a try who knows you might like it."}
{"text":"Arguably one of my favourite patios around, based on the vibe and atmosphere alone. Located in the centre of Shops at Don Mills expect nothing less but luxury cars and families always around. 

After a movie i decided to bring my girlfriend here after raving about it so much. Wasn't the warmest nights but It didn't bother us as our intention was just to have a light patio dinner.

From the time we walked in and settling the bill the service was top notch. Based on what we ordered the server even split some items for us so it would easier to share. To whom I assume was the manager, walked us to our table and made sure our server was to be expected instead of just leaving us in the dark. Can't say I could ask for anymore to be done. 

The food was good taking the recommendation of the herb gnocchi I also ordered the butternut squash soup and crab cakes, we enjoyed each and every dish. 

The reason why I dropped 1 star was the pricing a little high for what was received, 2 crab cakes and the pasta yielded $19 and $25. Although everything was prepared and served to satisfaction I don't feel it was worth the 67 odd so dollars I paid after tip. Although this don't deter me from coming back I feel as certain patrons would choose one of their many competitors footsteps away. I am all about quality over quantity but I just felt like it was a little expensive for what was received. I do not see Glow as a fancy schancy restaurant so maybe my opinion differs from others? 

As Shops at Don Mills sets a more luxurious vibe I can see why Glow has the leverage to price higher but at the same time it may or may hinder business from those who are not of such standard. 

Washroom is a little out of the way located in the corner of the restaurant down a flight of stairs. 

But** Glow is still an amazing spot for those who enjoy patio drinks and also a great spot to bring a date!"}
{"text":"Came here for day-early Father's Day celebration with my parents and boyfriend. We ordered:

- Grilled Calamari tapas
- Pickerel and Risotto special (x2)
- Asian spareribs
- Ribeye steak

The complimentary bread basket and spreads were delicious and fresh.

I agree with a previous review that says that the calamari was rubbery -- it was... which is unfortunate, because it looked beautiful and the accompanying olives/tomatoes were delicious.

The pickerel and risotto were just OK -- the risotto was actually really good, but the pickerel lacked flavor and seasoning.

The spareriibs and steak were fine, but nothing special.

Since it is a wine bar, the wine list IS quite impressive. I ordered the fizzy berry compote (vanilla vodka, muddled berries, strawberries, white cranberry juice
and soda), and it was to die for... and came with a stick of fresh berries!

I'd come here again, but I'm not running over..."}
{"text":"Lovely decor, beaming waitstaff, all around impressive atmosphere.  Upon arrival I spied a brochure with Rose Reisman's face on the cover it mentioned she had some input in the menu that is when it clicked that that Glow is affiliated with the Pickle Barrel--not a good sign.
Our waitress arrived promptly and took our drink orders.  The menu does have a reasonable amount of different items.  I settled on the soup of the day which was ginger carrot and the Santa Fe salad.  Prior to our meals we were given a small basket of bread with various dips, beet, hummus and pumpkin I think? Our server did describe them to us but it was too noisy to hear him.  
Our starter of soup was excellent very rich and thick.  The salad was so-so kinda on the bland side and consisted mostly of lettuce, quinoa and two small slices of avocado. Only a tablespoon of dressing was provided and wasn't enough to coat the salad to amp it up a bit.  After a few forkfuls I was bored with it.  Overall there are too many other places to eat at Don Mills that offer a more enjoyable dining experience than Glow.  I would probably return but just for drinks."}
{"text":"Went here for a night out with the girls. One of the worst places I've been to in a while. The food was terrible. The steaks were barely warm, the oven baked brussel sprouts were soggy and had a strange floral taste, and the macaroni and cheese was watery and tasted like soap. Kraft dinner is preferable to their Mac and cheese. Definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"Frankly speaking we hit this restaurant by accident. It's very spacious the service was pretty neat. I had a beef and mushroom on the whole wheat bread and my wife had her usual salad and her friend had chicken and cheese on the flat bread. She was gracious enough to offer me some of her chicken and it was pretty tasty. All in all the experience was good."}
{"text":"Glow Fresh Grill serves a buck a shuck every Wednesday after 4:00pm. It was Malpeque oysters, a little bit on the salty side.

However l, I do like how they serve half bottle wine. The patio and service is nice."}
{"text":"WOW, i was disappointed with the service when I went to this place. Two of my girlfriends and I went to shops on donmills to have a late night snack/drink since we had already eaten dinner and just wanted to have some girl time to chat and maybe order a dessert. We made the wrong choice to come to Glow. When we arrived, we were seated in the patio since that was what we chose. The greeter who lead us to the patio was very nice and accommodating. Then she told us our server will be with us shortly. About 5 minutes later our waiter arrived with a bowl of fresh breads and olive oil to eat as we looked at the menu. He later he comes back to take our orders ... we told him we were not ordering any entrees since we had just come from dinner and were only at GLOW to order some cocktails and perhaps some desserts. He immediately took away our bread basket even though it was clearly eaten as we were looking through the menu. My friend Lisa was still dipping her break stick into the olive oil when he took it away. We thought was was rude. He took our order of drinks + dessert and went on his way. We got our drinks and dessert and us girls were having a great time chatting for a good hour. Then our waiter comes back and asks if we wanted anything else but we said no since we had to drive that evening. Drinking and driving is a no no ... so we told him we were pacing ourselves but we hadn't said if we will order more later or not. He comes with our bill. We were shocked. WTH! We didn't even tell him that we were done or wanted the bill ... but he literally just plopped our bill in front of us as if he wanted to shoo us away cause we were not a table that was making him any money. Lastly, the patio was empty ... there was probably only 4 other tables seated around us. Rude Rude Rude. This restaurant needs to train their waiters better and not rush their customers to hurry-up-eat-leave!"}
{"text":"We came here for an early dinner, why I let my companions talk me into coming I'll never know.

Reviews people! It's here for a reason. 
After reading the reviews I had absolutely NO expectations, but even those terribly  low expectations were disappointed. 
The food was bland and un exciting. 
Service is the only reason for the 1 star."}
{"text":"Glow is a modern chic restaurant catered to the health conscious diner. Like many other modernized \"family\" restaurants, the atmosphere and decor remind me of a Joeys, Milestones or Millers. What separates Glow from the aforementioned is it's menu. A complete healthier choice menu, designed by Rose Reisman who also crafted a few healthier options on the Pickle Barrel Menu. 

Although I was skeptical of the idea, the items actually sounded good despite it's theme. I ordered the Wagyu beef burger with BBQ chips and salad. My date ordered the bun-less turkey burger with sweet potatoes and asparagus. Fresh juices like apple, ginger, beet and banana, orange, peach were refreshing and... well... fresh!
My burger was good, nice and juicy, super tender with the right amount of sweet in the compote/relish. The chips were crispy and waffle cut but the portion was a bit small. The Caesar salad was very standard, overall semi-filling but well executed. The Turkey burger was good as well with the same compote on top. What I liked best were the sweet potatoes. Three Large wedges, well spiced and seasoned, enough to fill you up in addition to the turkey patty. Although none of the dishes were really exciting or new, the execution and flavors were great. 

Overall, everything we had at Glow was tasty. The service was accommodating and quick. The waiters were nice and informing. The atmosphere was comfortable, casual and modern but the prices were a bit expensive given the portions. Understandably so, given it's \"healthy\" concept, I still thought it was a bit much."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant located at Shops at Don Mills, always walking past I've never had the chance to sit there as another restaurant would always pull me away. This time I made it my goal to visit and eat dinner there. 

Internior was unique and pink. Service was a tad slow. Now on to the food.

Tasty and everything on the menu seemed \"healthy\", upon further discovery, this is by Rose Weisman, the healthy chef featured on one page of the Pickle Barrel menu. The options were all light choices. Tandoori chicken was good, I really enjoyed the quinoa and hummus and sour yogurt mix. There was a lot to this dish despite it looking kinda shrimpy at first glance. The pasta could have been more flavourful and the noodles they used were not descriptive but still enjoyable. Recommended for app: Lobster mac and cheese - oh this was goood, so good that I wish they served more than the small app size offered.

They serve the same dessert shooters that Rose created for the Pickle Barrel.

It was a good experience and I would come back when I'm not feeling the likes of the Joey chain, Hunter chain, Chiptole, Bier mkt, or Jack astors nearby. Dont usually like chain restaurants. But this ones unique."}
{"text":"Baaaad. Like, really bad.
My pregnant friend wanted to try this place and who says no to a pregnant girl?
When we got there, our other friend who was with us mentioned that this restaurant is owned by The Pickle Barrel. Uh oh. 
The food was atrocious (um. Like The Pickle Barrel?)! I had the glow salad - nice mix of vegetables, but only one small piece of avocado, and a dressing that was as sweet as sugar. Disgusting.
Next, I had the grilled shrimp tapas plate as well as the tandoori chicken skewers. The shrimp were COLD and came with this weird acrid horseradish tasting sauce which was bitter and basically inedible. Four pieces of charred bread adorned the plate. Too bad they were so burnt tasting, they too were inedible. NEXT! 
Okay so the tandoori skewers. I was hoping for white meat. What I got was fatty thigh meat on a stick. Seasoning was not tandoori. I'm not actually sure what it was. The actual chicken was hard and sort of a lump stuck together on the stick. Gross. Plus, the plate was artfully smeared with some sort of mango sauce that did not taste good. Actually it was soapy. That's right. It tasted like Palmolive. Yes, I know what Palmolive tastes like but that's another story.
My pregnant friend had the pasta with shrimp and tomato sauce. It looked dry. My other friend had a nice piece of grilled salmon on a bad of greens slicked in oil. Hey! Rose Reisman! Unlike you, I'm an actual dietitian and I can tell you that pouring fat on greens is pretty contrary to what your menu is supposed to be about.
We had a few dessert shots (more to get the taste of my dinner out of my mouth) and they were actually yummy. One star.
Service was okay but a bit absent. Plus I saw one of the waiters sneeze while carrying plates in the dining room...HACHOOOOOO and totally didn't even try to cover his mouth. I'm sure that poor women whose back and hair he sneezed on is sick right about now.
Never going back. Glow...more like complete darkness."}
{"text":"I had never been to Glow Fresh Grill and knew nothing about the concept or the place at all, zero expectations, and because another local eatery was full, where we were going to have some fish tacos, my friends and I went to Glow instead.

The first thing I noted was a trying-way-too-hard-to-be-chic decor - not a fan, but what the heck, you might not like my jeans either but that doesn't mean I am a waste of time.

Our waiter was nice enough but I could hardly hear him he spoke so softly, he was certainly no pro - but that is not a deal breaker and I can deal with style anytime and a look-i am-only-here-to-get-outta-school-kinda-waiter.

So - here we go; WINE Yea!.  The selection on the menu is rather poor and all selections are minus the vintage.  HELLO \"Glow Fresh Grill and Wine Bar\", just a thought - if you're going to BE a \"wine bar\" why not BE a wine bar.  And then 3 oz glass and 5 oz glass pour offering only and 5 oz for $9 - $14 apparently Glow doesn't make enough $$ on their over priced wine pours to print a menu with the vintage.  OK - so they short pour - also not a deal breaker and if I wanted a 9 oz pour I can go to the KEG; check.

For dinner, we had one surf and turf (USDA Choice grilled beef tenderloin & 2 grilled tiger shrimp combo, served with pomme purée, chimichurri sauce & seasonal vegetables $29), one chicken supreme (oven roasted, stuffed with sundried tomatoes & fontina cheese,
served with roasted grape tomato & olive israeli couscous - $21) and one tilapia (lightly seasoned & grilled, topped with roasted tomatoes, kalamata olives & cipollini onions, served with roasted potatoes & asparagus - $20).  

The verdict - the presentation was good across the board, however that's where it all ended.  The beef was gamey (USDA? Really?  Can't find some good Alberta beef or something local from Ontario?) and the shrimp were shrimp - slightly overcooked for me, but not my friend - I like them slightly glassy so I found the nugget he passed to me a bit rubbery, but hey for $29 you can't expect your shrimp to be perfect (where are the sarcastic emoticons when you need them?). 

Chicken Supreme - Meh - it was chicken and despite ordering it myself, I thought, wow, how uninspiring is this (I don't typically order chicken but the decor had me worried so I went on safe, besides nothing too daring on this menu).

Tilapia - it also missed the mark and was slightly over cooked (however fish is the most challenging to do exceptionally well). The asparagus was cut and not snapped and that left them with some woody bits, hey but the potatoes we're GREAT.

All 3 of us at dinner would not return or recommend Glow.

If you go order potatoes and have a draft at the bar, at least you'll know the vintage of the beer."}
{"text":"This place looks very nice . However did not deliver when it comes to the taste.
Too bad.
There are better choices in tis area!
One of us ordered a fish which was good
I think it was called a mediterian or something along those lines. Anyway, he said it was great
I ordered some kind of a beef which was Terrible"}
{"text":"this is my second time at glow.  my first experience was that the food took a long time to.come through and the service was subpar and slow.  my impression was that this restaurant especially on weekends does not have enough wait staff.  this was true again for this past friday. 

 the venue was busy but and alive...music was great the spanish band was incredible and surpringly enough my friends and i (a group of 4) did not have to wait to get a table. i would say that glow knows how to create ambiance and a great environment byt it lacks in staffing.  i looked around a extrenely busy restaurant on a friday and saw barely any wait staff.   it took a while to get menus and did not really even have a waitress approach us.  until the front desk i believe her name wqs krishna was walking around and decided to take care of us because we promptedm  if it was not for her attentive and friendly demeanor.i dont know if our order would have been taken.  in my opinion she saved the day."}
{"text":"I'm finally writing a review about this HORRIBLE place, after being here many times because friends want to try it. Even after telling them, it's not good here. Don't say I didn't warn you.

The service here is no good, when we had large groups, there were unhappy and didn't want to comply, and we made reservations every time. This one time we had to separate into 3 different tables, because they could not accommodate the large group. Even after sitting in tables of 4-6 they still think it's reasonable to add a 18% gratuity to be bill, regardless.

The food is the worst I've ever had, and from coming here a few times and in groups, I was able to try almost everything. NOTHING was good.

some of the horrible food I could remember..
Caesar salad - PLAIN! can get better at McDonald!
lobster mac & cheese - salty and watery
grilled Calamari - not grilled! maybe boiled? where's the grill marks its was unoriginal and plain
Glow salad - no one wanted to touch it
satay platter - cold and dry (maybe it wasn't all cooked at the same time)
pasta primavera - the pasta was overcooked and mushy, no flavour
beef burger - it was dry and tough
The mini desserts! - tried every flavour each time, none of them stand out, and its overly sweet!

I can go on and on... I gave everything a try, it was horrible, regardless of what friends say, I hope I never have to return!"}
{"text":"This was a mediocre visit with some positives and negatives 

Positives 
Great early dinner deal $15 for 3 course (small portions)
Complimentary bread and dip 
Friendly service 
The pork loin dish was sublime 
Patio to sit in the warm evening 

Negatives
service was slow, however we did notice several staff not assisting in the serving of customers as it seemed this part was not their job however it left a lot of people with terrible service 
Bug in the salad - yuk

As I said the service was so slow that after 20 mins of waiting for something I ended up asking for the bill and leaving ..... They could have had more drinks from us and happily would have sat there most the evening spending money, instead we left for somewhere else that service wasn't quite as bad  

The poor girl that was looking after our tables was overwhelmed with the amount of work she had on and that's a failure in management for not properly overlooking their business and reacting to the service requirements"}
{"text":"This place should really have better reviews than it does on here. The atmosphere is awesome, there's lots of lightning, the patio is gorgeous and relaxing, friendly staff, and the restaurant is located in the perfect spot. 

I ordered the special of the day which was a spicy spaghetti with muscles and my boyfriend got an 8oz sirloin steak with mashed potatoes. I loved my spaghetti, it was so delicious and had so much taste. I also love that you get complementary bread with three spreads to choose from - spinach, spicy carrot, and hummus. The bruschetta on flatbread we got as an appetizer was great as well. My boyfriend's steak was good but not great (The Keg is still our favorite for steaks) but everything else was delicious. He also got the orange-blueberry-banana freshly squeezed drink which was also enjoyed.

Everything also came in a timely manner and we were seated right away. It was a Monday night so it wasn't busy at all. I can only imagine it gets pretty busy on the weekends so I can't comment about speed, or lack there of I should say. 

I definitely plan on coming back here to try more things off the menu."}
{"text":"What!?  $15 for a 3 course meal ?  I think i had to pay more last time i went to Mcdonald's after supersizing.  Seriously, the food ain't bad.  Roast Jerk Pork loin was much much muchhhhhh better than i could have made at home.  wife had salmon which looked much better than the one shown in the pictures on Yelp.  Dinner reminded me of 6 o'clock dining on a cruise..... a fond memory."}
{"text":"Ever since Shops @ Don Mills opened I've frequented Joey Don Mills to satisfy my appetite. Well I've always wanted to try Glow but never got up the nerve since Joey's is a tried and true tested staple, why mess with a great thing? Well it has finally happened, I tried Glow and they failed miserably. 

It took a packed Joey's with a wait time of 40+ minutes for the lounge to get me to step into this establishment and even while I was standing at the door with the hostess asking how many people were in my party, I still wanted to run out the door. I should've listened to my instincts.

When walking in, there isn't a standard hostess table, the door opens up to someone's table, correct me if I'm wrong but that isn't exactly the best way to greet a customer and whomever gets that table is just completely shafted. The decor is light wood paneling everywhere and fake plants, it has a very earthy tone which coincides with their healthy menu. The lights drove me insane, they changed from blue lighting (the best) to green light to red light. I felt like I was in a slow motion disco.

When I went to order my drinks, I browsed the drinks' menu, not a lot cocktails but they had the staple bellinis and margaritas. I ordered a mango margarita and was informed that they don't do blended cocktails anymore, in fact, they don't even own a blender...oh boy.

The menu is simply 2 pages or appetizers, salads, meats/poultry/fish and dessert. There wasn't a lot to choose from so I ended up ordering 4 appetizers and sharing. Mussels, lobster mac and cheese, sliders and crab cakes.

I couldn't even tell you which one I hated the worse. They were bland and had no flavour and the sliders didn't even come with buns, they were just the patty. The crab cakes were massive but they tasted like fake crab meat and the lobster mac and cheese didn't have any butter or cream in it and I couldn't even taste the lobster. The best thing (imo) were the mussels. They did have a slight fishy taste but it wasn't unbearably fishy tasting, it just tasted like you were eating seafood. 

Not only was the food horrible and bland but the prices were outrageous. I almost fell off my chair when the bill came and the most expensive app...not the crab cakes or even the lobster mac and cheese...it was the bunless sliders for $14! That is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. 

The only thing that made the evening bearable was the server. He was wonderful, I give him two thumbs up and he made my evening enjoyable even though the food was terribly awful. He was funny and conversed well and he knew what he was talking about. 

I never got the try an entree but realistically, I highly doubt it would've been any better than the appetizers and I'll never get to try them because I will never ever ever ever come back to this place EVER again! I don't care how long the wait is at Joey's, I'll starve before I eat at this place again."}
{"text":"Service was so bad the great menu was quickly forgotten. Messed every one of the four dishes three of us ordered. Waiter did not check on us so problems never got resolved. When I finally got fed up and asked for manager, she seemed nice and appreciated the feedback as she told us she was new and looking to make the place better. came back with a resolution to fix 4/4 incomplete plates was to try and convince us missing ingredients were there, blame the kitchen and the the took 15% off. Not impressed and will never be back."}
{"text":"This review is for their Saturday Brunch (not their Sunday buffet). 

I came here on a sunny Saturday at noon and they had room on the patio. The server was very nice about asking us whether we wanted to be in the shade, if we wanted to move two tables together, etc. It's a big, high-ceilinged restaurant. Very spacious. You have to take the elevators downstairs if you want to go to the bathroom, so give yourself time to get there!

The brunch menu is small and consists of a some french toast and a few eggs benny's dishes. But there was also the lunch menu that had plenty of options! All 3 of us ordered from the brunch menu anyways. 

Food - while waiting for our food, we were served some delicious bread accompanied by a tapenade and some olive oil. I got the eggs benny with a side of roasted potatoes and it was really excellent! Great value, IMO. 

Service - i think our server was new - he was shaky but ultimately no mishaps. They didn't rush us out and they let us take our time. But when we finally wanted the bill, it was a bit tricky to get their attention. Hehe you take the good with the bad I guess. 

Overall, it was a really nice brunch :)"}
{"text":"The waiter focused on a table of older people who were having a bottle of wine and took his sweet time, rarely checking back with us. My scotch was a huge disappointment, it was watered down from being left too long, by the time it came to me it tasted like water. The food took well over an hour and they used the excuse of a \"steak being cooked\" when in reality it doesn't take an hour to cook an 8oz steak. If you really had your heart set on coming here, just come for drink because you will be wasting your money. I paid $26 and I was still hungry...happy birthday to me right?"}
{"text":"Had lunch with my son. Decor is really cool, modern, with organic-looking wavy shapes on the ceiling and wine rack. Green glass sculptures, and sconces that look like horns. Chairs are comfy. 

Had chicken club which was fairly tasty, came with prosciutto which I took off. (Looked well cooked but I don't like it) Bread was a bit soggy and the actual sandwich was pretty small, but the chicken was nicely grilled. 
Came with the Glow salad which was delicious, fabulous sweet, tangy dressing. 
Also ordered the side of seasonal grilled vegetables which was excellent. Perfectly grilled crunchy asparagus, Brussels sprouts, purple carrots and parsnips. Dipped in my leftover glow salad dressing was an additional taste treat. 
Sever was really friendly and efficient, kept our water glasses filled. 
A little pricey but worth it for the atmosphere and quality of food. 
The rest rooms (Very nice, with soap that DOESNT DRY OUT YOUR HANDS!!) are in the basement, accessed by an elevator. There a really nice private meeting room in the basement as well. 

The outdoor patio looks great with really comfy chairs. Look forward to going back when it's warm. 
We didn't have reservations, but didn't have to wait very long to get a table, about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I had attended a dinner party of 27 people back in January. There was one waiter and one waitress assisting our party. I am extremely unsatisfied with the service that was provided to our table. While I was looking at the menu, the waiter had taken the menu from my HAND, which I found extremely rude. He did not ask whether I was done with the menu and I was evidently still looking at the menu. I did not get any water and had to ask for a glass of water 45 minutes into joining the dinner. Even after I had asked for water, the waiter still took at least 15 minutes. When the waiter finally brought the jug of water, he had only filled my cup half way. The food took long to arrive as I can understand why since it was a large dinner. However, after some guests' meals had arrived, then bread for the table arrived. Bread for the table should have arrived to the table before any meals were served. Bread for the table was also only for one side of the table as if there was a limit on how many baskets of bread can be served at each table. I have been to glow on two separate occasions and I do not remember bread being served for only a certain amount of guests and full cups of water only for some guests. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad. The menu states that the salad has the following: grilled ahi tuna, mango, pineapple, avocado, edamame, napa cabbage & red leaf lettuce. My salad did not have any avocado. Throughout the entire dinner, the waiter also did not ask me how the meal was and whether everything was okay. As matter of fact, I don't think I have ever been to any restaurant where the service was this ridiculously bad. I was the one who booked this reservation as I had recommended this restaurant to my friend. Only some guests who ordered steak had gotten steak knives.

I was so unsatisfied with this experience that I had sent an e-mail to the manager. He was apologetic and offered two free entrees so that I would give the restaurant another chance. 

The e-mail clearly stated this:

Jenn,
      Thank you so much for being so kind and understanding. As per our conversation, there will credit for two entrees under Jenn Tang. Please let your server or manager that there is a credit under your name. Feel free to call or email if you have any questions. Good night. 

My friend, who was also a guest of the same party had also written an e-mail and he had also offered her two free entrees.

After having a hard time finding people to give this restaurant another try, we finally decided to go this month. My friend had spoke to the manager on duty to let him know that she was coming and that I was also coming. After being seated, we asked to speak to the manager to let him know that we have arrived. He denied our two free entrees each as he said it was for a total of two free entrees for the both of us before even asking me to show my e-mail to confirm. He advised that he will need to speak to the other manager to make sure. He claimed that the other manager said that we would only get two free entrees between myself and my friend. We argued this as we both sent separate e-mails and we were never CC'd on each other's e-mails. My e-mail clearly states that there will be a credit for two entrees under MY NAME. This was very unprofessional. The manager on duty should have heard our side of the story and asked to see the e-mail before going ahead and denying our food. I would NEVER give this restaurant another try. The food lacks taste and the service is terrible."}
{"text":"Only came here because it was a really long wait for the bier market. I normally wouldn't come here as I've seen their menu and nothing seemed to catch my attention. I ordered the steak salad and a whisky sour. Overall the salad was mediocre, a little too much dressing for my taste and the steak was really hard to chew. Others at my table ordered the cheese pizza, the noodle bowl, octopus, and sea bass fillet. All the items were decent, basic flavours but nothing popped and made us say it was so delicious that we will return. The only pros were that they provided bread and hummus, and refilled our bread, and the staff were super friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and left disappointed.  Very expensive and the food was not very good.  Bland and small portions.  Really small.  We both left hungry.  Not recommended.  Service was okay.  Not a very memorable experience."}

{"text":"The best I can come up with for this place is: average. Food was good, not great. The glass sliding doors were open so it was a little warm. The service was a lot better than most of the reviews I read.

Valet was free but there was no attendant for 10 minutes!!! The design of the place is beautiful and I would definitely try it again. A couple people in my party of 15 had to have their food remade because it was under. Luckily for me, my salmon pasta was tasty and I have no complaints"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Sunday. There was all you can eat brunch for $20.99 pp or you can order a la carte but there were only 3 options so we went for all you can eat. Extremely satisfied with all the food. The omelette station was great , mussels , salad bar, and I really enjoyed the waffles and fruit. 

Only giving a 4 because for those who don't want to spend ~$30 or have a full meal can still have the a la carte option. The options provided I think were only omelettes"}
{"text":"Glow fresh grill is by far some of the worst customer service, food and atmosphere I've ever experienced in my life and that says a lot seeming as I've ate at my fair share of shabby restaurants through out my life time ! I've never met someone so rude condescending and untalented as Matthew their manager. Our food was unappetizing late and overpriced for what it was and when we returned it I heard Mathew utter a \"f*ck off\" under his breath which is absolutely unexceptionable ! Not only will I never return to this restaurant but I will ensure no one I know will ever eat at this establishment again. Shame on glow grill."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch on a Saturday. The staff were nice but the service was super slow. It took a while until they got our orders and even longer to bring the food even though they were not busy. I do like the decorations and they have a nice patio outside next to the playground in the middle of the shopping center.

We tried the benedic Florintine and the french toast. The benedic was not very good. I've definitely had better. There was not much flavors or sauce and no sides other than some potatoes. The French toast on the other was pretty good. It had a filling and pistachios and other nuts on top. I did like it a lot. I thought the food was a bit over-priced for the quality and portions but i guess you pay for the location. In general, I'd prefer the Joe's across the street to Glow.

{"text":"It seems like restaurants in Toronto are going downhill. I went here last night, the food was terrible. Service was bad and disorganized, even though server was nice. The band was great but maybe a little loud so you had to shout over to talk with someone (this is not the bands fault at all). Steak was full of fat and was not good quality meat. The crab cakes must have had filler in them. It seems that they must have hired a chef when it first opened and now the chef is gone and they have hired cooks to cook off the menu with zero quality control. (If I'm wrong then fire the chef). 
The prices are not cheap either. They also mis-charged an item on the bill and it took 10 minutes to check and sort it out. inconsistency with menu prices and charges. 
When I pay for something, as things are very expensive in this city, I expect good food. 
Maybe Glow will read these reviews and think a little."}
{"text":"My 3rd dinner in Toronto and it was excellent! First the interior was gorgeous! Very stylish and welcoming!

Since it was Tuesday, they had $6 cocktail special! I tried the Clean Leaf martini which was refreshing, light and delicious!

The menu was varied and unique. I don't eat meat, so I focused on the seafood selections. Several of us started with the Glow Salad.  It was huge and full of fresh spinach loaded with tons of fresh fruit. The only thing that didn't go with it was the stewed grape tomatoes. Don't get me wrong, I love tomatoes but they just didn't go with the flavors of the rest of the salad. 

On to dinner . . . I ordered the black cod. The dish was colorful and full of flavor! Lots of veggies complemented the fish perfectly!

I was in the restroom while someone in our group ordered dessert. It was delivered in a metal rack with numerous large shot glass filled with a variety of options. Several were gone so I didn't get to hear all the options. I opted for caramel pecan pie. The nice thing was each one was a few bites, which is perfect! I rarely order desserts as I'm not a big sweets fan. But sometimes if just like a bite or two. Great idea!!

Love this restaurant! Love the plaza! I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"What I love about glow is the food. Fresh, colourful and delicious every time. What fails miserably is the service. I have been here 5-6 times, Sunday brunch, lunch, dinner. Every time service is lacking. No one clears your dishes. No one offers refills on coffee or water. Tables unbused for over 30 min. Don't ask for anything like bread because it will take you asking twice and 30 min before you get it. The staff are uninformed about their menu and respond with \"I'm not sure\" to any questions about the food. Bill delivery is just as bad. 20+ min. We were told that they are not allowed to bring the bill until it is asked for even though we sat here with empty glasses and mugs and didn't want dessert. And it seems they are \"short staffed\" every time I come. This restaurant needs someone to take their front of house in hand and train them properly in guest service. 3 stars for the food alone."}
{"text":"Coming here on a guys night out Glow has been one of the original restaurants in the Shops on Don Mills complex. Serving an array of nice dishes we unfortunately didn't get a chance to try their entrees but had enough time for a round of drinks and their calamari. 
Glow is quite an upscale and romantic environment with beautiful and contemporary decor.
Sitting at the bar our entourage ordered drinks, however in terms of food we ordered their calamari, lightly pan fried in glad it wasn't battered. It was prepared well that you could taste the seafood...delish.
I'll have to come back here for a true dining experience to give this another updated review.

{"text":"I came here with a group of 10 for a corporate lunch, and didn't have to wait once we arrived for our reservation. 

This place is very different - tons of healthy options which is what I find really great. I ordered the turkey burger, which isn't actually a \"burger\" - so the menu a bit misleading in that way. It was actually a turkey burger patty with sweet potatoes on the side. My coworker ordered the veggie burger and again, it didn't come out as a \"burger\". 

I would come back here if I was looking for healthy options, but otherwise, Joeys in the same mall would be my go-to for tastier food."}
{"text":"Glow Fresh Grill it is not. =(

An upscale version of The Pickle Barrel - literally.  They are from the same owners!

But the commonality does not stop there because the quality of the food is the same.

The one thing that Glow has going for themselves is the ultra cool looking restaurant, with colorful modern decor and arguably a very chill cabana like patio, complete with a firepit on one end that's available to larger groups.

The two times I have visited Glow, I was not blown away or was impressed by the food.  

Inspired by healthy options, the food can be best described as reheated and dull, almost lacking any memorable flavors.  For a place with Fresh in their moniker, it currently does not deserve the name.  The self proclaimed fresh Turkey burger tasted plain, and dry like a piece of cardboard. There was no notable taste to think of. The pan seared crabcake is notable for being cold, and also dry. It arrived at our table looking very unappetizing in presentation.

What's worst is on my 3rd visit for a birthday, most of our group all had some kind of stomach ailment that involved the porcelain throne the following day that we suspect was the result of Glow from the evening before.  To add insult to injury, we were also charged a $3.50 per person plating fee for our cake, even when we were informed that we would not be, because of our advanced reservations and the manager at the time of making the reservations (2 weeks prior) had told us so. Upon bringing this to the manager on duty that evening, he would not allow it because he was not informed of this.  The final total alone just for plating 15 pieces of cake was over $50!

I cannot recommend Glow unless some improvements are made, for now, Glow only has style to go on but no substance!  There are much better options literally a stone throw's away in the same outdoor mall such as: Joeys, Bier Market, Linda, and Jack Astor's!"}
{"text":"This is a place where other restaurants can learn from service wise.  Glow's service is impeccable every time I have been here (at least 3 times).  Prompt, very courtesy and they seem genuinely happy.

You start off with (free) some bread with some beautiful spreads - this time was a beet spread (so fresh and vibrant tasting), a asiago cheese and I think spinach...and another sweet potato one.   

We tried a few appetizers - the creamy lobster mac ad cheese was just what i like - cheesy and you could actually see/taste the lobster chunks.  The other app we tried was the Korean short ribs.  I inhaled those so fast...tender and delicious.  I should have just ordered another round of those.  It comes with a cucumber kimchee type of salad.

The main I had was some ahi tuna salad.  It was ok...the tuna was fine..but on a bed of way too much lettuce...and well just not that exciting.  But for $24 I ate it!

Overall don't expect the best food, but you won't be disappointed with the service.  They do brunch here as well (not sure if they still have Sunday Jazz brunch still, but it's nice to listen to live music while eating)."}
{"text":"Was here last night - the selection of food was good, we ordered a pasta (one of the daily specials), I thought it was ok, my friends did not.  We also ordered the flatbread (yum), the sliders (also yum - albeit bunless (a plus), and really tasty),  We also had the edamame, which was a large plate, but a little heavy on the salt, nothing you can't shake off, and the crab cakes - which were ok (neither this way, nor that).  The drinks were good - the mojito was yummy.  The girls had the new york cheesecake, a great taster portion, which I would have tried if I liked cheesecake.  

The decor is also nice, both outside and in!

PS.  The servers were nice enough to move us from an inside table to a patio table as one opened up, and let us keep the same server, which was nice..."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch one day and had their \"Bunless Gourmet Turkey Burger\" (100% ontario ground turkey topped with dry fruit chutney, served with sweet potatoes wedges and grilled asparagus). The burger was a bit dry and the \"serving\" of grilled asparagus consisted of two spears of asparagus. In my opinion, that's hardly worth mentioning in the item's description on the menu. In addition, I found that some of the sweet potatoes were overcooked.

It is a bit deceiving as it is a restaurant that is trying to position itself as a healthy living choice, but when you look at the nutritional information online, it is hardly any better than a Pickle Barrel / Jack Astor's / Milestone's type of restaurant.

The ambiance is nice and the waiters are generally knowledgeable, but I would not rush back any time soon."}
{"text":"I have been to Glow Fresh Grill several times.  This place is never as packed like Joey's Don Mills.  However, I find it has the best patio amongst all.  Its patio is such a heaven in the Summer to me :D

The service in this place is usually good.  The food is ok but it definitely has room for improvement.  I was here last week with my girlfriend.  We both ordered linguine with shrimps.  It tasted ok but the linguine was too soft and the shrimps could have been cooked better to make them taste less like frozen shrimps.  I guess I will not risk order it again even though it was definitely not the worst.  However, we were both happy we got a free flatbread since we accepted to sit at the lounge.  There are 3 kinds of flatbreads to choose from the menu.  I picked the daily flatbread.  It was surprisingly good.  It was crispy and it tasted perfect.
I ordered a red sangria again, and I still like it.  I love the shot desserts here because of their easy-to-handle portion.  I ordered the Rocky Road this time.  It was sweet but it was not bad at all to me.

The complimentary fresh bread with 3-dips, weekend brunch and $15 three-course early dinner (4:30pm-6pm), as well as the best patio are the reasons people come here;)"}
{"text":"Came here for my friends' birthday party.
The service was okay - there was a mix up with our orders but our waiter was very nice about it. It's a restaurant catered to families - the park in the middle had a bunch of children running around the place haha.

10OZ CENTER-CUT RIBEYE
(Mashed potato and asparagus on the side)
Meeeeeeeeeh - they mixed up my order and it wasn't that good lol I'll give it 2/5 stars. The asparagus was very old too.

My friends' ordered other steaks as well (Grilled T-bone & Top Sirloin etc.), we requested it to be cooked to medium-rare but the steaks either came out blue (SUPER RARE) or cooked to the core (sooo hard to cut through, not juicy at all - all burnt on the outside).

Note that they charge a price for cake plating fee*
Will not return."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Saw the waiter twice the entire night. 25 mins before I could get his attention to ask for water. The poor service might be attributed to the large group and the fact that tip was automatically added for the large group. Would not go again and would no recommend."}
{"text":"We went here as a group to celebrate an occasion, and we were not very pleased with the food or the service. 
There were not many patrons, but it took them nearly 30 mins to give us our drinks. The service was slow. 
We had a couple of vegetarians in the group and there were not many choices. A friend ordered the margherita pizza, and it didn't have any sauce or any visible basil. 
We had some who ordered bouillabaisse and they did not like it as much either. 
The atmosphere and environment looks very good though, but if they could improve on some things it would be better."}
{"text":"Came again for lunch on a Friday. Ordered one of the specials which was a smoked salmon wrap.

I felt the need to lower my rating after this visit for various reasons. The table setting just wasn't as nice. Last time they provided lemon with the water, and straws. This time just the cup. The complimentary bread they gave out wasn't as good. It seemed a bit stale. The spread/dip they provide changed a little bit though. The wrap was a fair bit smaller than the sandwich I had last time. Taste was ok, but it really could have used more salmon.. I felt like there was only one slice in there. I liked their side Caesar though. Not as satisfied as last time.

But the main reason the stars went down was the speed of the service. It took a while for the bills to be brought over and even longer for the waiter to actually bring the machine to pay. He spent like 10 minutes going over the desserts at the table next to us instead. The weird thing is there a plenty of other servers (not waiters I guess?) that were walking around (one even motioned to our waiter) that I guess are not supposed to take the payment."}
{"text":"We went to celebrate my sister's 50th birthday. The bread at the start was good and they brought out some nice gf bread upon request.
Family was excited with the $1 each PEI oyster special and ordered 18!
The salads were good and huge!
My son's caprese still had the sticker on a tomato slice. They offered to replace it but when he said he did not want it, they removed the charge from the bill.
There were several items ordered at our table and everyone was happy with their meals....EXCEPT the risotto. They did clarify it was gf even though it was not indicated on the menu. Unfortunately it came topped with cheese, which is not described in the menu. They offered to get me one without cheese on top but there was cheese and butter in the risotto too so I just scraped off the top cheese. The risotto was flavourless and bland....do not order this item. I may try a gf pasta next time.
Desserts came in small shot glasses and my sister's bday dessert was comped (with a candle).
The mojitos were tasty and well made.
Service was excellent! Friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Mediocre food at best.. Stale bread... Grilled Calamari felt as if they stuck it in the microwave and called it \"an appetizer . \" service was decent. Rather go to Joey's across the street."}
{"text":"Opened by Pickle Barrel, Glow is meant to be this new healthy eating restaurant that ensures you do not over indulge on certain foods. They have burgers that are served bunless and a side of salad - so make sure you read the fine print prior to order to ensure you get what you want.

The food is ok, not memorable. The atmosphere and decor is beautiful. And the service was not bad - after hearing all the horror stories I thought we would be getting terrible service.

They also have these 100 calories shooter glass desserts that are cute, but also not memorable in taste.

I think this place is probably good for a drink (for the atmosphere and decor), but not so much for their food."}
{"text":"The name of the restaurant gives off the impression that it would be a funky, fresh, and exciting place to dine, but since I knew this was healthy chef Rose Reisman's restaurant (creator of the healthy menu options at Pickle Barrel and popular author) I wasn't that surprised when I saw the menu - it had your typical family restaurant menu options, with an Asian-fusion influence. Basically it was healthy fare with a twist. I.e. Burgers, pastas, salads, soups. 

Meal: I went with a group of friends for lunch, and half of us ordered the veggie burger with the edemame, charred corn, and spicy aioli salad, and the other half ordered the thai beef salad. The complimentary appetizer was a basket of crostini served with 3 types of dip: butternut squash, mint hummus, and olive tapenade. All were excellent and I much preferred the options and size to the usual bread & butter apps. All of the meals were warm and fresh when they arrived, and everyone was happy with the quality of the food. The salad flavouring was unique, and the veggie burger was very hearty and not one of those burgers where the ingredients are pureed and given faux-grill marks. You could easily see the chick peas, white beans, quinoa, and other ingredients which I personally enjoy in a veggie burger, but I know some people don't. 

Atmosphere: The decor was simple wood and it was spacious enough that I didn't feel like we were right in the lap of the table next to us. The waiters were prompt and pleasant, as well. 

Overall, while Glow wasn't an overly 'different' or spectacular dining experience, I'd still recommend it to anyone looking for a flavourful and healthy meal. You're bound to find something you like on the menu."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was wary to go here, but my sister wanted to try it for her birthday so that is where we went.

The atmosphere is really lovely, decor and setting was amazing and so it was off to a good impression. The first impression I got was it was very modern and chic. So we were greeted by very friendly staff and we ordered our drinks first. I got a cranberry vodka and the vodka was watered down or something because it did not taste how it normally would. After drinks we got three different types of dips along with bread, it was more rough like melba toast almost. The dips were; hummus, carrot and I forgot the other one.

So, we ordered and we got bruschetta as an appetizer; this was the best part of the meal. For entrees, I got the Mushroom chicken supreme; it was average and nothing special to be honest, I have had better. The positives were the chicken was moist, not dry; but the stuffing inside was average and did not meet my expectations. My sister had the Pasta Primavera, she mentioned her pasta was undercooked; and the flavour was not impressive. My cousin ordered the Warm wild mushroom salad, which she was satisfied with. And my other sister ordered Seafood linguine but changed the sauce from pesto to a tomato based sauce. She enjoyed her dish though.  

We ended up getting dessert as well. There was a variety of different flavours of desserts; I forgot most of the names as this was a couple of weeks ago. But it was average not worth the price. 

I would go again to attempt to try something different."}
{"text":"What exactly is so healthy about this place?     They stress the word \"healthy\" and \"fresh\" on every element of communication.   There's lots of green shown all over the restaurant.     The verbiage on the menu calls out wholesome-sounding ingredients.So, I ordered a hamburger.

Sure, it was a good hamburger... even a very good one.   But it happened to be one of the healthiest sounding items on the menu.    

No complaints, but let's call it what it is.  Isn't the place merely a Pickle Barrel with a vagina-like ceiling?"}
{"text":"Ate here earlier in the week with a large group. This is a very pretty restaurant and I love how they try to offer a good mix of healthy and comfort foods.

We ordered a variety of drinks, appetizers, meals and a few desserts. Lots of good drinks were had, with good reviews over the drink with beets in it, the alcoholic cranberry lemonade and beer. Disappointment that they were out of mint for the mojitos, but yet had mint for the lamb.

The Arctic char and lamb were well liked. I enjoyed a beet salad with shrimp added. By far my favourite part of the meal here though is the shot glass desserts. I had a delicious mini lemon curd and others had the chocolate mousse."}
{"text":"The decor of this place is  b e a u t i f u l ~ !
It's chic and you quickly feel relaxed in the environment. There's both a patio and an indoor dining area. Unfortunately, that's about it that I think Glow has going for them ... 

Came here for lunch today because we happened to find a parking spot right by Glow (Dining Companion has a fractured ankle and can't walk a significant distance). For what is being served, I thought the prices were quite overpriced. 

I ordered the grilled calamari appetizer as my main. An hour later, the food isn't sitting well in my stomach (TMI, I know). 

It was definitely a 'meh' experience. I can think of five restos off the top of my head that are just as nice and that you can invite your unemployed friend to.

A solid 2 star ~"}

Nice that its a shopping area so you can have a bit to eat and do some shopping."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal. We had a few shared plates and shared and appetizer and all of them were delicious. Australian Lamb Chops, short ribs and grilled calamari. All better than I expected. We shared the linguine and a side of mushrooms which went really well with the pasta. Food was very light and fresh. Can't wait to go back. Our server was a little slow getting to us but once she did she was great. For drinks we had a Caesar and red sangria. Both great. The atmosphere is enjoyable and relaxed. Decor is great. Overall very impressed."}
{"text":"I went there for Sunday morning brunch. Average food quality and average service. I expected more from a buffet breakfast.... NOTHING special at all!"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY from this place.  I tried to warn my friend that the service is bad here as I have been here twice before but since the patio was next to where the Jazz Festival was playing we chanced it.  HUGE mistake. We order a pitcher of Rum Punch. Waiter comes doesn't pour us the glass just puts the pitcher in front of my friend and walks away.  Rude but okay could be his first day or just not thinking. We look in the pitcher and a bug is floating in there. Call him back he takes it away and 10 min later comes back saying this is a new pitcher he saw the bartender make it. Once again we look and 2 bugs floating. Again he aplogoizes and later another waitress comes with our 3 pitcher. She at leasts pours us a glass and as she is pouring a bug floats again in our glass. Come on. 3 times! Her comment was its Spring time. Not acceptable. We send it back and order something different. Now lets talk about the food. The first 2 dishes came out fine. Never brought us proper sharing plates as we were sharing appetizers. The lobster Mac N' Cheese which sounds good was horrible. The sauce was more like water. We order another 2 appetizers which took over 40 min for flat bread? Not acceptable I go to cancel and manager said its coming out he will look after us. When it did come out it was bad as it has been sitting for pick up.   The bill comes we are charged for everything minus the pitcher but the new drinks and the food that took forever to come.  We paid the bill and vowed never ever to come back again."}

{"text":"My cousin and I completely stumbled upon this place because I always seem to lose my way when trying to get to Congee Star.  We decided to try something new instead since we were already at the Shops at Don Mills plaza.

We have never even heard of this place and we really didn't expect the high price tags of the dishes when we walked in.  It really doesn't look like the fancy dancy mini portioned dish place from the outside.  Even when we ordered our dishes and saw the hefty price tags we still expected huge portions because the food that they had really reminded me of bar food; they have stuff like lobster mac and cheese, steak, pastas, the usual stuff that a Moxie's would have.

To our surprise, the surf and turf dish and pesto pasta dish that we ordered were quite small.  We didn't mind too much though, but this may be important to know if you're going with a big eater.  The food and service was a-ok, but the extra star is for the ambiance of this place.  The patio was perfect when we went and the view was very nice, it wasn't facing a busy sidewalk like how many of the downtown restaurants have their patios situated.  The washroom is one of those washrooms that looks clean and zen and they even have a beautiful private dining room in the basement for events.

I like this place because it provided a nice, calming, ambient experience for my cousin and I to relax and have a few drinks and a good chat."}
{"text":"Dinner with 4 friends at Glow. Never been before so it was yet discovered. We all ordered red which seemed to suit each main course. I had the sirloin med rare cooked to perfection. It came with mashed potatoes,albeit a small potion and a few broccoli florets. Could have been more to the side dishes. My friend had the chicken ravioli which was delicious and a fair portion. My other friend had the veggie linguini. Not bad but flavour was missing. Fourth friend ordered the  chicken noodle dish. Ok but not a big deal. All in all. 8 outta 10 score. Waitress Joyceline was wonderful and attentive. We would go back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Glow is lovely -- airy, bright, and open to the patio during the summer. I found the service a bit slow -- it took us awhile to flag down a waiter when we first arrived and had some questions before ordering. It was also a busy Saturday night so that may have been part of the delay.

The appetizer we ordered was great -- Med flatbread. I wasn't as big a fan of my main course -- the bunless veggie burger. They offered me a bun so I said yes, though I wasn't expecting it. I ended up bringing a lot of the food home, which they were very nice about. They have sturdy plastic containers rather than flimsy styrofoam ones, which was a pleasant surprise. All in all, I would advise against the veggie burger, which is very chick pea based and thus a heavy main course. 

I would recommend Glow for a casual dinner though you should know it comes at a cost. It is a little bit on the pricier side (though most of the ones at Shops at Don Mills are)."}
{"text":"I ordered the Lamb shank for dinner. It was supposed to be served medium rare but it was almost well done when I got it. I didn't say anything because it tasted good regardless. Service was pleasant and so was the place."}
{"text":"I was taken to this restuarant for my birthday last year, being told \"if you're going to have a big birthday dinner, we'll take you somewhere healthy for lunch\".

Glow's value prop is that they offer portioned-controlled meals that use alternate, light ingredients. Ex. the burgers don't come with buns, their sandwiches are open-faced (i.e. 1 side of bread only) and they don't use heavy ingredients like cream or butter. The menu was created by the same woman who created the healthy menu options for Pickle Barrel, but what I don't like is that for some reason Glow doesn't include calorie counts on their menu. Minus one star from me - why not here, at an entire restuarant dedicated to apparent \"healthy choice\" food items?

On my first occasion, I ordered the sliders and the lobster mac and cheese. I liked how the sliders were each a different meat with different toppings for variety, and they were very flavourful. This was an appetizer, but if you weren't incredibly hungry (and for the price), it could pass for an entree. The lobster mac and cheese was dry and the cheese was tasteless (lacking butter and cream perhaps?) and I barely tasted any lobster at all. It reminded me of Homer Simpson's \"hello taste? Are you in there taste?\" diet moment. So a hit and a miss on that visit.

The next time I visited, I opted for the open faced philly cheese steak. I had a hard time imagining that this was a low-cal option as it came on a prezel bun loaded with melted cheese. The side salad it came with however had a very light but tasty vinigerette dressing, with fresh berries that were perfectly ripe and juicy. Overall, it was an extremely tasty sandwich and I left feeling good about my waistline. 

For the price, the portion sizes on a few of the items just arn't worth it. I appreciate the healthy portion sizes, but can we adjust the price please? The dry, tasteless lobster mac and cheese comes in at a whopping $18 for a portion smaller than my cereal bowl. And it would be great if I could get some calorie counts up in this piece. But overall, the food is decent and I like to think that maybe, just maybe my arse won't be wider for it."}
{"text":"We went there at 4pm, it wasn't busy yet it took forever for our server to come to our table.  Other servers would pass and look but not even acknowledge us so weird.  The food was mediocre I had the Thai beef salad and the beef was chewy, not good.  The food was on the higher end and not worth it.  Overpriced, poor service and so so food.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I give Glow a 3/5 for food and a 5/5 for service.

I felt the food was just average but had wonderful presentation. We were here for dinner and ordered....

Lobster Mac and cheese - dry and not cheesy enough. i could tell from digging in my spoon that it was dry the first time as a few pieces just fell out of my spoon
Crab Cakes - honestly this tastes like mcdonalds filet fish !!! If you want to order this just get it at mcd for a few dollars
Slow cooked beef sliders - it came w/ 3 sliders. It was slightly dry. I think it needs a little sauce in there for a little kick & uniqueness.
Red Thai Shrimp Curry Bowl - This was quite good and filling. I quite liked the sauce. 

Service was excellent as I didn't feel as though our table was that pleasant to deal with as someone was always asking for something. But they were very nice about it."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Once dressed up on a Saturday night. Delicious meal and wine with cute date. Second time was this past weekend for lunch, again the food was amazing (not over loaded with oils, sauces and grease). I had the stuffed French toast very tasty. A side note I really appreciated that the restaurant has an elevator to the washrooms. Not only did this help me with my broken ankle but growing up with an uncle who is a quadriplegic I've noted that many places claim to be wheel chair accessible but that just means they can move a couple tables to \"fit\" someone in. Hope it's a trend for all new restaurants."}
{"text":"We came here because joeys had a 45 mins wait. I was so pleasantly surprised with our experience.

I have a very specific diet and they were accommodating to all of my needs. The other three people I dined with also really enjoyed there meals.

I was also cold halfway through my meal and asked if they could change the temperature. They weren't able to but our sweet waitress Shelby brought me over a blanket. 

Thank you Shelby for your great service. We will be back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my husband on Saturday night. This was on e of the worse places I have been to in a while. We sat there for 30 minutes waiting for our server. My husband finally had to go ask the hostess if we were going to be served. Then a server finally arrived at our table. we ordered our drinks. We got the mojito and a white wine sangria. I have never tasted anything so terrible in my life! My husband finished his but I wasn't able to drink it at all! Then came the food. We got some crab cakes and a kale salad to share. The crab cakes were subpar. Even someone learning to cook could have made it. The kale salad was a big disappointment. It was overly dressed with a mixture of lemon and orange juice which made it very sour. All in all a very disappointing experience. I would not be going back."}
{"text":"Wow... I have never been to a decent restaurant with such bad quality of food. Geez. Feel like I wasted my stomach. 
The hamburger..is just two pieces of over cooked super dry meat. The potatos on the side are chewy, not crunchy.. No word to describe. Tooo greasy. 
The smoke salmon Benedict is just disappointing. 
The bruschetta is the worst I have ever had. Just taste like super light salsa on toasted bread.
Service: slow service and our waitress doesnt even come often. Hard to even get water. One of the waitresses was sweeping the floor beside us while we were eating.
Atmosphere: Thats the only good thing about this restaurant I'd say."}
{"text":"So I was excited to hear about this place.  I thought it would be an excellent choice for food.  Turns out that I was wrong.  I am still waiting for my waiter to help.  

So let's see what to say.

The salmon was dry, which is disappointing.  Even the different dipping sauces they had for the bread was not good.  I will say the muscles were good, which is why they get two starts instead of one star.

Next time I am in Toronto, I will be eating downtown..."}
{"text":"Went with the family for moms birthday Saturday night. We really enjoyed ourselves!!

It's in an awesome spot!
They serve smart great food!
The staff are really good and helpful!

What more can I say...

The charcuterie platter was especially nice! Someone put some effort into that. The little desserts were also great, and shareable. I liked the key lime best!

The kale Caesar is good enough to go back for on its own!!"}
{"text":"Hate writing negative reviews but honestly just go over to joey's. 

The food really wasn't that great. Portions weren't big either. Only real positive was less wait. Service was also only average.

They tried to put a spin on the burger, veggie burger and turkey burger. Most didn't work out too well. Portions could definitely have been a little bigger."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday evening, not to crowded  music was load hard to hear each other when talking , service was horrible, got seated, than a long while for someone to come take the order, drinks where flat. (coke ) one of the cokes came so warm and the cup was hot. requested another one, she went and just added ice in it. food came, 2 of us ordered linguine shrimp pasta, Both very tasteless, dull, no flavour,  one of the 2 dishes came so watery, BOTH needed salt. really i was sick to my stomach. the 3rd person ordered the char fish dish on a bed of salad, salad had no dressing or salt, fish looked frozen because when it was baked the white gooey stuff was still on it, no seasoning at all, also the char fish should be white i got 2 peaces one was white one was pink . took us about 10 minutes to ask for salt  because no one acknowledge us , requested it from 2 different waitress because salt is not even on the table. didn't deserve the tip we gave and will never step back again"}
{"text":"1st time here, great food!

Came here for Sunday brunch and it was very good!

The look of the place is great especially looking outside at the ice rink and people skating having fun. 

They have an omelette station that someone cooks it for you and a good variety of selections. 

Fresh fruit station with enough variety.

Overall good place for Brunch, it's very busy on the weekends so be ready to wait or call ahead to make reservations. 

The soup was amazing, it was roasted red pepper and if you add some parmesan cheese slice they had (the real stuff) it tastes great."}
{"text":"We went on a perfect patio day so that really makes up for the ridiculously slow service we received. The guy who was our server was attentive but forgetful and is never around. When we do tell him we want something, he forgets about it (like our bill).

The food selection is actually pretty healthy - there are quite a bit of vegetarian and gluten-free options and the drinks menu is quite extensive. The food, however, is a bit expensive and some of which were quite bland.

- Tomato Medley $13 was a couple of flat bread, home-made mozzarella and giant tomatoes slightly roasted and crudely presented. It was very hard to bite because the tomatoes and mozzarellas are huge.
- Shrimp Pesto Linguine $19 the shrimps were giant but the pasta was hard and bland
- Mediterranean Basa Fillet  $20 best dish of the night - the fish was done perfectly and quite delicious.
- Peanut Butter Cheesecake was super tiny and tasted more like mousse than cheesecake

Overall, i'd come back here only because i love their patio. Their food really is a hit or miss."}
{"text":"I did not read Yelp reviews for Glow Fresh Grill before going in to the restaurant for lunch... so I don't really know what to expect. But my experience was A-OK! 

Empty restaurant for a weekday late lunch. Service of course has to be fast and efficient!! There were like 5 staffs+ and me alone. 

The deco is quite nice and chic. Love the outside patio... would be a nice place for some drinks and hang out with friends on those loungers! For the washrooms, you can take an elevator downstairs. At the lower level, there is this private dinning room for at least 20 people that you can have private party arranged.. the room is nicely decorated and cozy too. 

The complimentary starter bread with raisins comes with 3 dips.. love the pumpkin, hummus and artichoke were so-so 

OK for the food... yes I am starting my Decemburger with a Mediterranean Burger ($14) here. No that photo I took was my burger but bunless... Taste wise I find it A-OK, nicely cooked to medium well and the beef is Angus grounded and really lightly seasoned and with feta cheese on the side. But the sides..those greek potato were cold, however I love the spinach underneath the meat patty. 

I don't mind Glow Fresh Grill more healthy concept in their menu... but it will be something to get use to if one used to having a lot of carbs, creamy sauces and tons of salt in everything."}
{"text":"Had dinner there a few days before Christmas. We had our baby with us and we were able to get a great seat with our huge stroller( the hostess made it work )

The service was great, with the exception of our server. She seem preoccupied, and also seem to rush us for our order (after shopping with a baby you want to relax...we took our time to order). 

At the end of our meal we ordered our coffee from another server since our server seemed to be MIA.

I would say the food was OK, but my partner says he won't go back.

I think I'll be willing to try again. Hopefully we get a different server:)"}
{"text":"It was a family brunch. 
There was 12 of us in total and had a table reserved for 11am. We were at a big table outside on the patio. The interor of the restaurant was very nice same with the patio, it was huge with tones of tables and some tables even had fancy couches you can sit with groups of people.
The waiter came 15min after we sat down. 
After he took our orders the drinks finally came another 15min after. He even forgot a few and took another 10min to get the rest of the drinks.
The food took over an hour to get to our table.
The 2 children for their food 30min before everyone and when they finished eatting we still hadnt even got ours..
When the food finally came at around 1230ish..it was warm and didnt all come out at the same time. 2 plates came out every like 5minutes..
The food overall we all thought was OK..
It was a vegeterian restaurant which was a bonus of most of the vegeterians at the table but it wasn't anything great for the price we were paying and the location it was in.

I give it a 1 star only because the restaurant was really neat looking! 
The service was horrible.
The food was ok."}
{"text":"The food here sucks.  Based on the concept and menu it should be good, You're going to read the menu and say to yourself, these Yelpers don't know what they're taking about, then you're going to go.  And then, after paying way too much for a very sub-par dinner, you're going to be upset that you didn't listen to us.  This place won't be around long unless they fire all of their \"chefs\" immediately.  I'd be embarrassed to have my name on the menu.    

For starters we ordered crab cakes, lobster steam buns, and edamame.  The crab cakes were all filler and were difficult to eat due to being all gluten.  The lobster roll things were short on lobster and heavy on steamed buns.  Mame' was the only win here.

For entrees, my steak was supposed to be aged 44 days.  Based on lack of tenderness, this was a \"select\" steak at best if it was aged that long.  They also forgot to use a saltshaker on it, and it was overcooked.  The fingerlings were overcooked then reheated, and again lacking salt.  Massive fail. 

Other coworkers had similar failings.  Asparagus we got was overcooked to the point of being gross, the stir fry was rice-mush, and the other two entrees were considered better than ours, but still not good.  

This is a place that I'll never go back to, and I highly recommend you don't try it either."}
{"text":"Came with family for a Sunday brunch, and found them good but not great.

First, due to limited parking, we were planning to use the free valet parking, but no attendant was to be found on the first two passes. Of course he had arrived in station by the time I discharged the family around the corner and found parking nearby (luckily).

Service was good, most of us were doing buffet and there was a decent selection and no shortage of hot food.

However, the scrambled eggs did not appear to be real eggs, that or they were overly mixed and cooked. They were far too bright yellow and with no streaks of egg white, a common sign of powdered eggs.

I ordered a la carte, a Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict. I had asked for a runny yolk, as poached eggs should naturally be (I was surprised to even be asked). However they were not cooked to my order, the yolks were solid.and crumbling, well over-cooked.

All said I would try again, but would hope for a slightly better execution next time. Liked the atmosphere and views, the prices were not too outrageous."}
{"text":"Nop pasta...but steak... The past did not impressed me..I do better make then here...but steak was good...Give you free valet parking..need to prepare small tip in cash, but, it's ok..then parking far, far, far, from the restaurant..and hard to find a good spot at the Donmills shopping mall at dinner time."}
{"text":"Glow is a pretty impressive restaurant with its contemporary interior design.  I couldn't help but have high hopes that their food would be equally amazing as well, if not better.
Ordered:
Char-Grilled Octopus ($17) - It was tender and subtly flavored.   There was not a lot though for $17.
Blue Crab Cakes ($16) - Fresh and tasty with the dip.  Thought the price was a bit high for what we got.
Grilled Angus Striploin ($33) - Hand and aged 44 days; served with whipped yukon gold potato, and asparagus spears.  Potato was whipped to creamy perfection, and the asparagus had that lovely fresh crispiness to them that was nice.  I ordered the steak to be cooked to medium and it came out well done. 
bouillabaisse ($27) - french style fish stew, mussels, calamari, shrimp, salmon in a white wine, tomato, garlic saffron broth.  My friend had to return this dish to the kitchen because the sauce was excessively sour.  The manager even tasted it himself and was horrified.
Glow mixed grill ($33) - flatiron steak, chorizo sausage, octopus, salmon, served with asparagus, thyme-dijon sauce & an oregano vinaigrette tomato salad.  Everything was good except for the steak.  My friend ordered a Rare but it came out medium well done as well,  The manager had another cooked for her to her liking.
Tahitian vanilla bean creme brulee served with mini biscotti  ($10) - One of the best creme brulee I've ever had.  Light, not too sweet.  Superb.
Mini desserts to go (Dozen for $30) - Nice selection.  Favourite was Key Lime Flavor.
It's a bit disappointing that the cooking was not up to par, especially when the dishes were on the pricier side.  The manager was trying to make amend, but he only did it for 2 dishes, and not the others.  He also gave us a discount as well which was thoughtful.  Thank you."}
{"text":"I've read plenty of mixed review for Glow Fresh Grill so I went in with low expectations, just in case.

The restaurant's decor is really beautiful and would be a great place to go on a date. The lighting is very dim which gives off a relaxing ambience, however too dim to see your food clearly. This was also my first time seeing a digital drink menu! The drink menus were on display using iPads and the majority of us were amazed.

The service was on average throughout the night because the two servers were serving our table of 20 people. They were pretty quick to set up our table and seat us but it took a while for the main course to arrive. Luckily many of us were catching up with friends so it didn't seem as long.

I ordered the hard lemonade and shrimp pesto linguine. First off, the hard lemonade wasn't hard at all because I didn't taste any alcohol in it. I basically paid $10 for lemonade. The linguine was decent but it was a bit on the greasy side. I liked how they didn't cheap out on the shrimp because they were quite large and there were about 4 of them. These days I can never finish what I eat so I took the leftovers home.

This was the first time a restaurant had included gratuity in the bill. Not many of us noticed that until someone pointed it out. Perhaps we had gratuity included because of the large party? I wonder if they include it in some groups. Someone should let me know.

Overall, I enjoyed the overall dining experience and wouldn't mind coming back again. Unfortunately it's a bit of a drive for me so unless there's a birthday happening here then I'll drive 30 minutes to Glow."}
{"text":"Came here on a cloudy cold Sunday for lunch.

Funny story - I've seen this place a few times while walking through shoppes at don't mills and thought it was a spa. When my friend suggested we go there I thought she meant for facials. Haha

So when we walked up saw the picture of Rose Reisman, the lady whose healthy recipes are in the pickle barrel menus. Great! Those are my favourites there. WooHoo a full menu of these in one place!

Decor:  Light wood, bright, classy, but comfortable. Both tables and booths. 

There were only people at three other tables

Staff:  OK. I wish every restaurant had staff like this. Everything was on point.  I realise some of it was because only a few tables were occupied, but you can tell it would be just as great if there was a packed house.

Food: when we sat we got bread, nice warm fluffy bread with three different spreads, a beet, spinach, and olive one. My friend asked if there was gluten free and they brought some out. Nice. 

I got the bunless turkey burger with sweet potatoes and asparagus. Delicious. I'd go back just for the sweet potatoes. They were sweet and cinnamony. Yum!

My friend got the chicken curry with salad. The chicken used was thighs, apparently the salad dressing was amazing.  Going to try that next time!

Price:  pretty good for the quality of food that they serve, and the service. 

Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"We came here a few days ago for my sister's birthday. I've lost count over how many times I've been to Glow now! It's definitely our favorite option in the Don Mills Shops area and our family's go-to place for celebration dinners. 

They offer standard dishes (e.g. burgers, steak, flatbread) but with a health-conscious twist. For example, the complimentary bread comes with two freshly made hummus dips (this time it was spinach and cheese, the other was made of beets) and you can substitute any of the sides with brussel sprouts, sweet potato mash, etc. 

They have a ton of great options along with daily specials but the majority of us usually all go for the steak sirloin with brussel sprouts and sweet potato mash on the side. I got mine medium rare and it was cooked exactly the way I like it. Every time we've been here the wait staff have been warm and friendly and the food is consistently good so I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews here. I would go there and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Typical fare a la Jack Astor's, Joey's, etc.

Atmosphere is ok, looks fancy but not much to write home about."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant while going through the mazes that is the Shops of Don Mills. Came in around 8:30pm on a Saturday night and it was packed. Surprisingly we were seated pretty quickly in a spacious booth towards the back walll.

Decorwise this a really beautiful restaurant. Wood panneling lined the walls, beige banquets and solid wooden tables. This restaurant really glows.....the ceiling looks like a white sandy ocean floor with ripples running through and it glows in different colours.

Our waiter was really friendly and gave us plenty of time to go over the menus. The drinks menu is digital...like on a Ipad sort of device...first time experiencing that at a restaurant but it was very easy to use and pretty cool.

For drinks we started off with a Red Wine Sangria. It was huge....bigger then what I expected in a tall glass with strawberries and oranges floating inside and garnished with a squewer of berries. Refreshing and tasty, I'm glad it was huge.

After we placed our order the waiter brought over a compliamentary amuse bouche.

Toast crisps with cranberries and sunflower seeds with a trio of dips consisting of an artichoke hummus, butternut squash, and pesto. I enjoyed all the dips and loved the crisps...good start to the meal.

Appetizer

Bruschetta Flatbread - Made with 100% whole wheat floor topped with marinated plum tomatoes, goat cheese & fresh basil.
Ample amount of toppings...no skimping on goat cheese here and a nice crisp crust.

Main

Asian Black Cod steamed with black bean sauce, served with asian vegetable stir-fry & aztec rice.
Could possibly be the best fish dish I ever eaten! The Cod was succulent juicy and every morsel was very flavourful. I loved the aztec rice, nutty tasting with a blend of red rice, brown rice, split peas, and lentils. Beautiful presentation and good portion size. Super yummy!

Dessert

The waiter brought over a rack of a whole bunch of mini dessert shots and went over each selection. Great assortment but after I heard the word peanutbutter I stopped listening to the rest.

Chocolate peanut butter shot -  Garnished with a pecan and topped with a thick chocolate ganache followed by creamy peanutbutter cheese cake and a chocolate cookie crust...I savoured every bite!

I also snagged a bite of my dates Smores Shot - creamy marshmellow filling, chocolate mousse and graham cracker crust....also very good!

Washed down with tea and coffee. A superberb meal from start to finish! Excellent service, friendly waiter that was attentive throughout the whole meal, and I was shocked that despite how packed the restaurant was, wait times for seats and food were very quick. I definitely recommend checking this restaurant out if you are ever in the Don Mills area. Beautiful decor and a great menu."}
