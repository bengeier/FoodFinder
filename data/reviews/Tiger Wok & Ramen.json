{"text":"I ordered the cold noodle ramen. For 9.99 it only came with egg and cucumbers. That's it.  There's no sauce and the noodles were overcooked.  Terribly disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered my food. Waited 25 mins after complaining multiple times and just got a refund. It's like the staff are used to being rude to customers. Cooks are slower than molasses and oblivious to the line. There are better places to eat at the food court. Wish I would've read the other horrible reviews..."}
{"text":"This by far is the worst resturant in caesars palace. I'll never come back here again!"}
{"text":"Overpriced cheap fast food. I got the pad thai. Noodles were overcooked and mushy. Couldn't taste anything else but an overpowering citrus flavor. There was a weird squishy fried ingredient which I assume was tofu? I like generally like tofu but this was mushy cardboard. Just not good food by any means. Two stars for being edible, which seems to fit with the Yelp consensus. Should've checked the app beforehand. I'm sure I won't be the last one person to write one of these buyer's remorse reviews for this place."}
{"text":"Pretty decent ramen and sushi. It's in a food court so it gets 4 stars. If it was a more formal stand alone restaurant, I would give it 3. I enjoyed the flavor of the ramen a lot and it was nice having a sushi option!"}
{"text":"Instant noodle, nothing special,  average price is above 10 dollars, you might want to try something else"}
{"text":"Wow....thinking we would just be getting an average dish when ordering the Vegetable Fried Rice with Cashews like all other fast food Chinese, we were so surprised at how good it was..  We liked it so much we made a point of returning on our next visit to Vegas not once, but twice.  Next time I will venture out and try another dish, but for now I absolutely think the fried rice is the best I have had!!  It has a great taste and the cashews add so much to the flavor.....I can't wait to try one of their bowls.  Only disappointment is there is not another Tiger Wok & Ramen in our area!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a combo sushi and soup but was over charged. first, they gave me the wrong order, then replaced with an old sushi from refrigerator.  the soup is not good.  I will never never eat there ever."}
{"text":"best chinese food in las vegas!!! food was done fast n fresh. food court was nice and clean do recommend this place..friendly enviroment"}
{"text":"Considering it's just food court Chinese, I was actually very impressed. Granted, the price is much higher than you would expect for a food court. 

I went with the General Tso's chicken and it was very good. It works have been better all white meat, but the sauce and sauteed onions were delicious."}
{"text":"You can never expect too much from food in a food court, even if it's in Caesar's Palace...so I went in with no expectations. It's actually not too bad! I wanted warm comfort food and that's what I got. Good enough for me! The broth is a bit light on flavor and you only get 4 slices of tripe, but the noodles were the perfect texture for me! I'm just impressed it wasn't hard/half-cooked or uber soggy. 3/5. 4/5 with rice noodles. :^)"}
{"text":"Located in the food court of Ceasar's Palace.  The service was quick and friendly.  I ordered my food to go and they were good about placing all silverware, napkins, chopsticks, etc. into my to go bag.  The Shrimp Pad Thai had plenty of shrimp in it.  The shrimp was cooked just right.  There were plenty of bean sprouts, lime, peanuts, but no veggies.  I like some veggies with my pad thai but for a food court option, this place was great."}
{"text":"This place is trash. They lost our ticket order and we waited over an hour and a half for our food. Food was definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Pho Tai - not so great
Spicy Tuna Roll - I was starved and was good. Not the best tho. 

Price - very pricey

Customer service:
Cashier - really nice. No problem.

Here's my issue. After ordering with no problems, I picked up my food. I stirred my pho tai to discover HAIR IN MY SOUP! Went back and told the cashier that had no problem getting the manager to refund my meal. After waiting what seemed like an eternity, the manager finally came. Asked the cashier, NOT US, what the problem is and what we wanted. Looks at my mother, in a VERY unprofessional way. (As if, WE put the hair in the soup). Look, I understand people do this, but not EVERYONE is that pathetic. Anyways, I got my refund, which gives them 1 star."}
{"text":"This places is terrible. It's in a food court so I wasn't expecting amazing gourmet food, but even for food court food it's just bad. I ordered the pho tai, and shared and the Pad Thai and pork gyoza. The pho was awful. I didn't eat it. The meat looked gray in color and had no flavor. The soup itself was watery and bland at best. Also it came with no vegetables which is uncommon for pho. The pork gyoza were fine, but not special. They were probably frozen, reheated and fried, but overall not bad. The Pad Thai was fine also, but just not really very good. I would not recommend coming here for a cheaper dinner out while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Too exhausted to wait in lines at fancy restaurants, so I tried this one at food court. It's surprisingly very delicious!"}
{"text":"The soda was excellent. Quality Pepsi. 

The employees were nice. 

The BBQ Pork Fried Rice was junk."}
{"text":"The service was great and I received my order quickly. The yakisoba tasted amazing! It was better than the average food court experience/food."}
{"text":"As one would expect at a casino food court restaurant,  the food was low quality, overpriced and unimpressive. I ordered the General Tso's Chicken($13.49). It didn't come with rice so there was a $3.99 up charge. The chicken was dry and tough, like it was leftover from the previous day. I hadn't eaten all day so I forced myself to eat it. Hopefully, I won't regret it later. I will update my review if I end up sick."}
{"text":"Yes this is a food court restaurant so don't put your expectations high. For what it is, the ramen is pretty good. They give lots of noodles and the broth is pretty scrumptious, however the toppings are whatever. Price is expensive but it's Vegas. The ramen is spectacular but I can't say the same for the Pad Thai. For starters they had use pho noodles, but I didn't mind. What bothered me was the amount of Pad Thai sauce that was given to me. There was a larger ratio of sauce to noodles that it made it a struggle to eat the dish. I give this place a 4 for the ramen, also don't expect much good customer service. I won't say which one, but one of the cashier was rude and completely unprofessional, please fire her."}
{"text":"This was straight up grossest ramen I've ever had. I got smelt like something out of a barn the pork tasted like it went bad and they served up anyways. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. i couldn't eat it I had to throw it away

The price was kind of high for low quality noodles but the guy at the counter was pretty chill shout out to him though 
 
Don't eat here smh"}
{"text":"Had the worst Cashier today she was so rude I'm never eating at this place ever. The food was mediocre and the service was horrendous. I've never been treated so rudely in my life. If you ever come across this Old Mexican Cashier steer clear she will probably spit in your soup. Al B Sure to never eat here again. 5/17/2016 11:30am"}
{"text":"New food court in Caesar's. I had the veggie fried rice with chicken. Typical fried rice with corn, peas, carrots, cashews and a little egg. For $3 extra, I did not get a lot of chicken, but the pieces I did get were good. Overall good flavor. It was also made to order, which is a bonus vs. sitting in a hot pan under a heating lamp. The noodles are probably the way to go but I'm doing a stupid detox (yes, in Vegas!) so no gluten."}
{"text":"I'm not a picky eater but I dropped $12 on ramen that I barely ate - it was that bad. Walked out hungry. Would have rather had cup noodles."}
{"text":"I got pho and it was worst pho I've ever got. I went there to return but the cashier offered me something else. I took sweet&soup chicken with rice. It was kind of meh in overall maybe I'm expecting too much from 12$ I paid but I think it should be at least eatable"}
{"text":"This place is just in a little food court in Caesars Palace. I wasn't excepting much but with the hangover I had the bowl of udon was delicious and exactly what I needed. I opted to get the combo (udon + sushi) because I was starving but the sushi was not good. Definitely not worth getting."}
{"text":"Do not get the pho. It's sooo bland that you're basically eating noodles and water!!

Besides that, shoyu and tonkatsu ravens were delicious and portion was good. We got lots of noodles but unfortunately not enough broth. But we also only ordered take out so maybe you get more broth when you eat in. But they both had very good flavors and seasonings."}
{"text":"First had to wait 15 minutes to place a order since the male cashier did not know what he was doing. After placing the order I had to wait an additional 15 minutes for my food. The food was horrible. I got some potstickers and they were soggy. I got some Mongolian beef and was horrific. The beef was cold and felt it was microwaved. The crispy noodles was no joke. A bunch of crispy noodles piled on top of soggy vegetables. I spent 40 dollars on a horrible experience plus a big waste of time. Do not waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"20/100 yelp challenge

This is one of the fast food joint in Ceasar Palace\"s food court. They have a small menu with 4 noodle choice and a few sushi. For noodles, they have Tonkatsu ramen, shoyu ramen, pho and pho special.
We got combo shoyu ramen with edename for $14 and shoyu ramen and spicy tuna roll for $18.
The ramen is just a OK... Very salty, a lot of noodle, 2 slide of pork and half hard boil eggs! The sushi is OK, edible! 
It is expensive but as expected for Las Vegas resort! I am not sure if I go back!"}
{"text":"We were looking for quick Asian food to eat and stumbled upon this place. We ordered two noodle dishes and a beef dish and all of the entrees were surprisingly good! The portions were generous and prices were as expected while you are in Vegas. This place is worth checking out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I both had the ramen. He had the beef and I had pork. It was delicious! I would say eat here for the convenience and if you want something delicious."}
{"text":"I had fried rice. I didn't have any expectation, but it was so tasty! It was just like real Japanese fried rice!"}
{"text":"It's a food court shop, so don't set your expectations too high. 

I was here with my family during the Christmas holidays and oh man the lines were out the door for this shop. It took about 40 minutes from lining up to getting the food.

The lo mein noodles were just okay. It was $9 for a somewhat small portion that felt like mostly cabbage than noodles. If you want meat, you are charged extra. The noodles were slightly sweet and otherwise okay. I'd eat again but would prefer other options.

The tonkotsu ramen looked promising but it's food court ramen, so it's not gourmet. My sister said the meat was pretty decent."}
{"text":"A retreat from burgers and pizza. It's good to find this place at Caesar's. 

Prices are quite high for their quality. 

Service - there was a waiting time for our tonkotsu ramen and spicy tuna roll of approximately 6 mins which is ok."}
{"text":"Really fresh food. Stopped for late lunch, got sweet and sour chicken with steamed rice. Would recommend"}
{"text":"Hard to say how the food is since the cashier ignored me as I stood in front of the counter with money in hand. Restocked cups and moved around random register items instead of acknowledging me. I decided to order next door instead. Others were promptly greeted so I don't know what about me indicated that I just wanted to stand there and NOT order food."}
{"text":"Over pay for some lame food...  Ordered the sweet and sour shrimp, cook mixed some old dried up shrimp with fresh ones."}
{"text":"Ordered a rainbow roll, got a California roll just some stale salmon and tuna on top and the lo mein was bland. We were over it after the first bite."}
{"text":"was pleasantly surprised at the quality and size of the order of Mongolian Beef and General Tso's chicken. It tasted fresh and had tons of flavor. The entrees are around $13 then add $2 for rice.....and another $2.50 for a soda. Tiger Wok and Ramen is in the food court at Ceasars palace and there are several other places to eat as well."}
{"text":"Horribly overpriced, tasted like top ramen, noodles were clumped on the bottom with tepid warm broth, a few diced onions and two pieces of fatty pork, absolute garbage"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst places I have ever had pad Thai.Soggy and watery noodles .Too sweet and oily."}
{"text":"If you in the mood for some good curry you have to go to tiger I Love the chicken curry!!!! Fast and friendly services. Reasonable priced."}
{"text":"Was stuck in a conference at Caesars Palace.  Gave into my ramen cravings by buying a bowl at Tiger Wok in the casino food court.  WORST DECISION EVER.

My god, this was a train wreck of a ramen bowl.  The noodles were over done, the broth tasted like clear water, and the serving size was laughably small.  Cost was high, value was low, taste was off.

The only creative thing in this entire order was the flat bottom soup spoon.

Avoid, avoid, avoid."}
{"text":"Sorry kids. This is nasty. My order: $27. Pad Thai, Sweet & Sour chicken, rice. (Like you can mess up rice...really.) Both chicken dishes; Pad Thai...how do f up Pad Thai? The chicken has no flavor and the sauce/noodles are yellow, like chicken broth. Again, no flavor. Sweet and sour chicken, at least to me, is always breast meat! Which is white. Not brown meat with a pink center. Seriously! Some of the chicken look like gizzards. . Let me just say that I'm not thrilled at the idea of having to go and spend MORE money on something else. 

I Expect this kind of quality of food from maybe an off road restaurant. Not a restaurant inside of Caesars Palace. I'm sorry, but chicken should not be chewy...with a pink center. I will definitely not ever attempt to try Tiger Wok & Ramen again and I definitely do not recommend anyone attempt to try any of the food from here."}
{"text":"Hit the caesars palace food court with some of my friends after a night out to hit Earl of sandwhich and decided to skip out on that and get some ramen,

For a food court vendor, they make surprisingly good tonkotsu ramen. Definitely worth getting the extra pork in there. Soup had good flavor to it. It perfect after a night out of drinking.

Avoid getting bottled water since its almost 6 bucks, just opt for a water cup."}
{"text":"I ate here on a recent trip to vegas and was very pleased.  I was about to go to the pizza spot but was talked into trying this spot instead.  I ordered the Mongolian beef with rice, the beef was perfectly cooked and tasty with just the right amount of spice.  I was very impressed and happy that i chose this place over the pizza spot."}
{"text":"I had sweet & sour chicken with fried rice. It was horrible. The chicken was hard and over cooked. The sauce was heavy and too sweet. The fried rice was crunchy, hard and tasted like they start with undercooked rice. The rice had no egg or veggies mixed in. I will never go back to Tiger Wok."}
{"text":"Food is good quality but the lo-mein was not worth the price. 9 dollars and extra to add chicken? No thank you."}
{"text":"Ordered tonkotsu ramen and a rainbow roll.

Honestly not sure what I expected. The sushi roll was cold and borderline stale. Most of the flavor had been lost. 

The ramen broth was weak in both flavor and appearance. The bamboo shoots are thin. The noodles are average but still tasty and they give you plenty. The pork pieces were dry. The egg was very overcooked and incredibly dry.

Prices are incredibly awful given the quality, but I suppose that should have been expected from a food court =/"}
{"text":"This was in the food court in Caesar's palace right near the casino entrance to the Forum shops. I was craving something with soup and Tonkotsu Ramen sounded amazing.

Unfortunately the ramen didn't live up to my expectations. Usually I'm used to Tonkotsu ramen having rich and creamy with a juicy and tender piece of pork and a runny egg. At this location, the soup was basically clear, like a pork clear soup broth, the egg was hard boiled and the noodles were just average. It tasted more like a
Chinese food item rather than a Japanese Tonkotsu ramen.

Overall a miss and a place I'd avoid in he future. The one redeem factor was that the soup came out super hot, which is a nice touch cause I enjoy my soup a little warmer than usual."}
{"text":"Not as bad as the other reviews say, but definitely overpriced. I don't think I would want their food again tho."}
{"text":"Second day in Vegas and by now craving Asian food. We were going to see Celine Dion at Caesars Palace so decided to head to the food court there for something quick. Cashier was nice and friendly, but sorry to say the food was not up to par, not even close to Panda Express. Hubby had high hopes for the ramen since it's in their name. I ordered something basic that should be hard to mess up; it left me wishing I paid the $2 extra for the fried rice so the fact that they used a cheaper rice grain would have been masked."}
{"text":"Not even worth it sadly... sweet and sour shrimp was so soggy it was hard to swallow.  Rice was hard and lacked any flavor whatsoever.."}
{"text":"For \"fast food\", this place exceeded my expectations. The ramen was impressive for what it is. Came out fast and was much tastier than the ramen from my hometown. It was so fast and convenient for a temporary Caesar's Palace guest to walk downstairs and turn a corner for my quick fix of noodle soup that I came back a second night in a row. However, the fried rice my friends ordered.... wasn't so fried. Tasted like it was fresh out of the rice steamer. They handled our complaint well and replaced with with another item on the menu hassle-free. Try this place out, you might like it."}
{"text":"Fabulous and Quick service with above average food court food.

Mary Joy is always kind and makes sure your order is correct and that you feel valued as a customer."}
{"text":"Tried noodles, fried rice, and ramen. Not that great. It was alright. It's a bit pricey but seeing the location. I guess. I don't know. Normally I love tonkatsu ramen but I didn't right now."}
{"text":"Very good food with a lot of flavor. Cheap compared to most places on the strip but very tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"Avoid this place! Extremely rude staff and entrees are $15 with no rice! Place to me is a rip off"}
{"text":"After arriving I wanted something that was Asian hearty and quick. This appeared to be the only option in Caesars food court.This was a salty Ramen that although edible was not the best. It did have a buttery taste but really it wasn't very good! I guess you shouldn't expect much however it's a  disappointment when you pay $12 for a sodium infested bowl of noodles that lacks flavour! Perhaps this wouldn't be a bad meal after polishing off 10-15 drinks on a busy evening with mates but I would not It recommend it for lunch. You will be gasping like a dog in summer for water a few hours later! Plus it came with virtually no vegetables and only two paper thin slices of meat! There's better options folks! Try something else in the food court!"}
{"text":"No. 

Got the spicy chicken and side of KimChee. Good news is kimchee was actually decent.

The spicy Chicken Laska was not. Greasy. Too much coconut milk. Chicken wasn't good. It wasn't enjoyable. I barely ate it. 

I'll never do this place again."}
{"text":"The food is waaaay too salty, service is mediocre, and a 20 oz bottle of water costs $5.49.  I'm Asian, and this food is an embarrassment to Asian culture. Worst ramen I've ever eaten. The salt gave me a terrible headache after eating just half of my portion."}
{"text":"Overpriced. But decent food. Probably one of the better options in the food court. Seating is a hot commodity!"}
{"text":"I ordered the vegetable fried rice from Tiger Wok & Ramen. Since it is in a food court, I definitely didn't expect fireworks or anything spectacular at all. However, it was still a pretty bad let down. The rice smelled like egg, it was rather oily, and didn't appear to be a fully finished \"fried rice\" meal.

On the other hand, my friend ordered some ramen and claimed that it was pretty good, according to food court standards.

Is this a place I would go back to? Never. However, it might be worth a shot for you to try - the prices are reasonable and when it is busy the food is still prepared in a pretty timely manner."}
{"text":"It's obviously overpriced sitting a casino like Cesars but the Generals Chicken was really good! Yuramis was my cashier and she was very nice."}
{"text":"This place is inside Caesars Palace, in food court.  We were sick of buffet, thought try something simple.  Ordered ramen, was pretty bad.  The ramen were stuck together, they need a bigger container to cook or something.  Came in very small portion too."}
{"text":"I had the Pad Thai but it was very sour and tasted fishy even though I got chicken. The service is good and employees are nice."}
{"text":"Do not come after midnight the food here is rubbish... the noodles were over cooked & the chicken fried rice was blan"}
{"text":"The premade tuna rolls reminded me of an airport in the 90s.  It was a tough choice between that or the oversalted ramen that was sitting there since they opened.  I decided to splurge and got both.  Today was a sad day."}
{"text":"Worst curry dish ever! We decided to try this place out because i was craving rice.  I got the stir fry curry dish (meat only, no veggies) Cooks are sloppy, they just dumped the rice in the container.  I do not plan to ever eat here again."}
{"text":"dropped in while picking out my parlays for the cfb bowl games. service was quick and so was food. i got the chicken pad thai, which was ok. a good amount of meat in there. taste was fine, nothing authentic, but, it is a food court. cashier was nice enough to ask if i wanted a fork or chopsticks. price point was a couple bucks higher than the surrounding eateries."}
{"text":"Order the chicken Phad Thai it's super bomb! You won't be disappointed and it's also a large portion as well."}
{"text":"20 minutes still no order up. Very slow and no one cares. Now they say I am next. Six more people get orders grrr. This place is ate up."}
{"text":"This place is in the food court of Caesars Palace. With that being said, I felt this place is like troll food. Seeing what other people thought on their own photos and reviews seems like it will apply to all their food items on their menu. I looked at my ramen and immediately knew this shit was not gonna be worth $50 in which was for 3 ramens and 2 drinks. I felt like the cooks there were like \"let's see all these fools pay top dollar for the bullshit food we gone make today.\" Jokes really on us because they're open late and it seems on weekends type vibes, a lot of the drunk people will go there for a quick bite. They'll see the menu looks bomb af and then they'll tell their whole squad to come over and just eat here. Because that's exactly what happened to me for a party of 5 who were behind me in line lol. Anyways I wouldn't go here for food again even if all the food places are closed. Take the L and save your foodie troubles till the next morning or available foodie idea to come up. We're in Vegas so there should be more options out there besides this crap. You don't get what you pay for over here so beware of fake reviews to boost up their stats lol. I think it's a matter of time till this fast food place is replaced but the funny thing is that they're probably makin the most money of all the other fast food restaurants since they're open up later than the other spots. Smh."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an alternative not to eat at a fancy Caesars Palace restaurant. There is a food court inside Caesars for eats. Pretty much the selections at this food court aren't highly rated on Yelp, but  at least Tiger Wok has some decent reviews. 

What's ordered: 

Crispy Noodles w/chicken- They were crispy white noodles (they seem like the ones you find at an Asian grocery store), it came with sauce to spread on for some flavor and of course chicken pieces (my choice) for toppings, all housed in a boxed container. This entree tasted okay nothing special. The portions were good, the crispy noodles wont be as crispy anymore once the sauce is spread on but the flavor and chicken add-on was just decent.

Tonkatsu Ramen- Portions good, the pork toppings was tender and tasty. The broth has some seasoning to it. My verdict with this choice just made this one to recommend on their menu.

Overall good spot to try out but don't expect to pay cheap. I already paid $9 for my crispy noodles and then paying additional for meats to go with that really?!"}
{"text":"Tiger Wok and Ramen is in the Caesars Palace food court. The lines here are long and kind of convoluted as there are people everywhere attempting to find something to eat. I tried the tonkatsu ramen which wasn't too bad but it was not the best I have ever had. Be aware of the sticker shock that comes with Caesars food though, as a bowl of tonkatsu ramen here costs upwards of $12-14 depending on the ingredients/extras you put in. 

Oh. And don't get the bbq pork buns. They were a sticky, slimy, gooey mess."}
{"text":"We got great service while ordering our Ramen but it took 25 minutes before we got our food.  Way too much time for a very simple meal.  The food quality and flavor was average but expected at this location. I recommend that they multi task to help the single cook."}
{"text":"Food: 1/5.   Price: 2/5.   

Simple and quick meal at Caesars Palace food court because I was too lazy to leave to hotel and get something nice. The Laksa was fairly pricey at $12 for food court soup, and it came in a plastic bowl. The broth was flavorful and had a nice kick of spice to it. There were a couple of shrimps and fish cakes. The noodles were thick but a little soggy. 

Favorites:
* Laksa ($11.99) - spicy chicken broth, fish cake, hard boiled egg, cooked shrimp, bean sprouts"}
{"text":"Food was okay. The spicy chicken noodle ramen made my stomach hurt. I also tried the beef and broccoli a different day and the sauce they used tasted weird. 
I recommend the sweet  chicken they have.
That plate was good."}
{"text":"I have nothing better to say on the whole than I last reported on Phillips Seafood.  Same Forum Food Court; same new modern decor; same crowded and messy restroom; and same high prices.  But while the Spicy Tuna Roll I ordered was a very disappointing cold, rice-laden, and pre-packaged sushi roll--no different than one would find in most supermarkets--my entree of Chicken Lo Mein was a tasty and ample portion of White and Green Onions, celery, carrots, Bok Choy, Lo Mein Noodles, and moist morsels of white meat chicken."}
{"text":"I've never seen sushi cut so thin. Lame! Too much rice and not enough actual fish. Giving them 2 stars because it was quick (pre made) and the wasabi was good and spicy not watered down... but that cut was LAME!!!"}
{"text":"It's $10+tax Fried rice............ Only rice egg and soy sauce.. So overpriced, worst food court restaurant ever!!"}
{"text":"Sadly agree with many reviews.  Food is oily and tasteless.  Had General Tso chicken - just not well done.  Signs looked like food was great.  Sadly - No"}
{"text":"Its not the worse Ramen I ever had but it wasn't the greatest, for food court food.
One of the most expensive food court dishes I have ever paid for though. I got 2 Shoyu Ramen bowls with seaweed,  Costed me $40. Overall the atmosphere was nice, the cashiers were friendly.  Would I come back? No."}
{"text":"This place is utterly disgusting. Service was good but food is nasty. I expect better restaurants from Caesars. Cup of noodles is better than this place. Yuck."}
