{"text":"This place is a great spot to grab a bite to eat and watch some games at the sports book . Give the Bubba-Chubby hot dog a try . It's delicious"}
{"text":"Zero stars if i could.    1..Grilled sandwich is ice cold.   2.   I ask for a cup for water. (Not everyone drinks soda)   They say they're out of water cups.   I ask for a regular cup.   They say they count them, so no.  WHAT??  Guess they thought because the grilled food was going to be so ICE COLD, I didnt deserve water.  Make me wonder what else is happening there if this is their attitude about WATER!!  So far, I'm not sick from the tasteless, COLD sandwich. STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"Gridiron Grill (Red Rock Casino & Hotel / Las Vegas)  Hip Hip Hooray!! I'm the Duke!!!  I'm not going to lie.  Gridiron Grill is just another food option when in you're at Red Rock Casino. Red Rock has so many other options. But I prefer the Gridiron Grill because it's convenient, the prices are low, and there's rarely a line. The burgers and fried dishes are okay.  Their Chicken Caesar Salad is delicious and packed with a lot of chicken breast.  The location is perfect.  It faces the sports book and is just steps from the poker room.  I've never had a bad experience here and will continue to come here as long as they serve that delicious Chicken Caesar Salad.  See you soon!"}
