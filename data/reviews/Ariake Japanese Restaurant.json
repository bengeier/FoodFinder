{"text":"Great small restaurant. I love their service and the sushi is good as well!"}
{"text":"Nice quaint booths and friendly accommodating staff. Let me change the California roll for salmon. Reasonably priced. The rolls were a bit messy."}
{"text":"Showed up at 8:40pm this past Saturday night. Resturant sign stated closed at 10pm. There was a free table to the left of the entrance. We were told that they were full and wouldn't seat us so we left.
Read some past comments listed here saying similar behavior. They don't seem to know how to run a business close to closing time."}
{"text":"I've been living in this area for a year now and I always pass this place and wonder about it. Tonight I finally decided to give it a try. There was only one other party there when I got there but as the night went on, the restaurant got busy. The food was good. I especially enjoyed the spicy salmon pizza. And the rolls were also good! I was happy that the menu had spicy options and that they were actually spicy. The only downside is that there is only one waitress and it gets busy. But I'd definitely go again as its so close to home. The prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I stumbled to this place a few years back while looking for a place nearby.  Since than been here more than 5 times and always enjoyed myself.  It is a small Japanese place that offers fresh sushi at affordable price.  They give you miso soup and edamame with your orders.  Service is excellent as it is never too busy.  Got a couple of different rolls each time and some sashimi.  Ariake Japanese Restaurant is a nice find in Thornhill right outside Promenade Mall.  They accept credit card as well.

{"text":"Love this place! Looks like it's owned by a Japanese couple, the waitress (might be the wife) is very nice, she greeted us and always came to ask if the food is ok, she blinked to me too :)

The chief (might be the husband) is nice too. Have to say that their sushis are great! They really put a lot of stuff into the rolls. We ordered Mountain Roll (spicy salmon, shrimp, avocado and crunches), Hawaii Roll (mango, papaya, salmon and avocado), yam roll and eel roll. Those 2 special rolls tasted great. The yam and eel rolls were yum too."}
{"text":"My son has been telling me for awhile that I should try this place out. Finally went yesterday with a group of 5 and let me tell you he was right.
Great food at very reasonable prices .
Everything we tried from soup to rolls to bento boxes was fresh and tasty.
The place was also great since as a group we found it quiet and it allowed us to talk to one another without screaming.
All in all highly recommended AAAAAAA++++++++++++++++++l"}
{"text":"Small family run restaurant. 
Great sushi. Always fresh and nicely prepared. 
Their bento box is great too. 
Always a family favourite."}
{"text":"We went here on 28 February 2018 at around 15:30.  The place was empty but we were greeted right away.  We sat at a regular table, but there are booths that are quite private which is nice.  However since there wasn't anyone else, we opted for a regular table.  Obviously the service was prompt and the food was delicious.  I had the beef dumpling soup and my husband had a dish with sushi and shrimp.  It was a bit pricey, but it was tasty and great service."}
{"text":"We came for lunch around 11am and we're warmly greeted and sat in a private biith. We enjoyed some cold sake with out commentary tea, soup and edemame. We ordered the lunch serving of Ugani which was very fresh and a shrimp Bento. The service was very attentive and prompt, and the prices very reasonable. For this area, it we as a very authentic  experience. Some of the reviews appear to speak to service issues, however what we observed are extremely hard working, earnest people who strive to offer an exception service. Of note, we left a cell phone on the table and they were quite gracious in keeping it safe.  If you are in the area, I would encourage you to come at a reasonable time and enjoy a quaint sushi experienced"}
{"text":"The teriyaki salmon is cooked good,  the sushi's are agreeable. 
Overall good food and good environment and service. 
Its not the top sushi I've tried , but its will not disappoint you."}
{"text":"All I can say is, if you're only open for 20 more minutes, don't sit your customers down and bring then water.  That's horrible customer service!  Luckily for my fiancee and I,  Cynthia's Chinese restaurant in the same plaza was open for another hour and a half, where we enjoyed excellent service and very delicious food."}
{"text":"Just stay away from the fried roll set.  I loved this place, from its menu with great selection, miso soup and salad with complimentary edamane beans.  It just fell apart once the fried roll came.  Sooooooooo much rice. Really the filling felt like 15% of the roll.  And me, well I appreciate it at 90%. Even the service and decor was great, just felt the entree food needs to be more deserving. Sigh. Soooooooooooo much rice"}
{"text":"This place is my go to place for take out or a quick bite to eat . I have no complaints. Love that they give you complimentary edmame when you sit down. The service can be better but whatever that's life. I like the private cubicles that you eat in. Never busy. Rolls are huge."}
{"text":"Came for dinner tonight and had the best meal! I was visiting from la and wanted some good quality Japanese food and found Ariake via Yelp. I ordered some sashimi, sushi and the New York roll with brown rice, so sooooo good!  Service was super attentive and welcoming. Will definitely be back when I am in town!"}
{"text":"Tasty, big, fresh and unique sushi rollls! I've been to every sushi restaurant in the area but this one is best. It is small and unfortunately hidden away but definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Yelp, I'm BACK! Living in a new city (from Richmond, VA to Richmond Hill, Ontario) and ready to check out ALL the best eats. My first stop was rewarding myself with some sushi after such a long move. I was in the area doing some shopping and decided to stop in the closest place, Ariake.

First off, this place is ADORABLE! It's teeny (about 7-8 tables), but on one side are private booths with curtains, so private and cute! Around 1 PM on a Saturday, it was pretty empty. I ordered four sushi rolls to go-- Tuna Avocado, Cherry Roll, Godzilla Roll and the Dancing Roll. Very tasty rolls with fresh ingredients. The specialty rolls are HUGE, so the value for the price is amazing. These are a more traditional Japanese roll, very simple ingredients, and flavors, letting the fresh fish shine as the star; they are loosely rolled (not super tight). The rice is perfect, has just the right chew to it.

Overall, great value for the money, tasty sushi. Not the best I've EVER had, but certainly worth visiting again. I will definitely be trying more sushi spots around the area for comparison's sake. I would also come here to dine in at one of the cute private booths, perfect for a date night!"}
{"text":"This intimate sushi restaurant has become a recent favourite. 

Their brown rice sushi option is the best in the city. It doesn't overwhelm the taste of the fish at all. Instead it adds a richness to the flavour. Other places should take a page from their book.

Their sashimi is incredibly fresh. Amazing Salmon and Eel. 

Best rolls: 
Pacific Roll (switch the smoked salmon for raw salmon!!)
Dancing Roll
Rose Roll

Also, they have delicious vegetarian options. An amazing seaweed salad, vegetable tempura roll, and vegetable jumbo roll are all outstanding, even for a non vegetarian."}
{"text":"Not ayce sushi but the quality is amazing!  The ambience is nice and comfortable with private booths and open seating.  The food quality is excellent and service was attentive."}
{"text":"Ariake Japanese Restaurant is right across from the Promenade Mall at Bathurst and Centre Street.

This restaurant is runned by Japanese family. A really small place that can sit around 20 people tops with 1 waitress during lunch time.

They do have lunch specials from $8.95. 

You will be served with Miso soup and edamame and fresh fruits as desserts.

There is an option for brown rice sushi if you do prefer with a surcharge.

The service is nice and friendly I usually come for a late lunch so there is never long wait for my food order. But I can see it can get busy with just 1 sushi chef and 1 waitress..

The sushi is fresh and tasty..and the cook food are all nicely prepared!

They accepts Visa and Mastercard"}
