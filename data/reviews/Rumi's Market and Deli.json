{"text":"I drive past this place everyday on my way to work and back so I've been keeping tabs on their progress, or lack thereof. I stopped in awhile back and was told that it wasn't fully ready as there were no groceries but they were serving food. It looked really nice and the food was really good so I had some high expectations on my next visit. I've still been driving past it every day but it hasn't seemed to attract any customers and is always empty. My curiosity got the best of me and I decided to check it out again. How could a place this nice not be packed for lunch? Once you step inside, see their groceries and try their food it's easy to see why it's a ghost town. It's essentially a Bodega/Convenience store that's trying to pass itself off as a high end place. The groceries are what you would find at a 7/11 and the food looked and tasted like it was leftovers. There were no other customers and the customer service was horrendously comical. The manager tried to convince me that fruit drink is the same as fruit juice. I guess Red #40 is code word for strawberries. 

The worst part about this whole ordeal was that I really wanted to like this place. What seemed like a promising market is headed for an episode of Kitchen Nightmares. 

I definitely do not recommend it. Thankfully there are much better options nearby."}
{"text":"The grocery store at Rumi's market is great. It is clean, tidy and everything is reasonably priced. The products are fresh. The restaurant section also looks nice and clean."}
{"text":"Be careful with the stuff you buy from this store. They have expired items on shelves, and unexpired goods are occasionally molded! Staff is rude as well."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Rumi's quite a bit. Unfortunately we showed up after the salad and olive bar was closed. But the guy behind the counter was helpful and nice. We described what we wanted and he made us some plates. It was good not stellar. The whole atmosphere was very enjoyable and the food was good. I also bought some kind of Middle Eastern  pistachio cookies from the grocery. They were delicious! I want to go back when the olive bar is open!!"}
{"text":"I am so lucky to have found this place .... Till I came across this place I had to make the trip all the way to Parma to find Indian groceries.  Now it's all just at my doorstep. ... spices,  naan,  rice varieties,  yogurt,  buttermilk, and plenty of frozen foods options.  And if I don't want to cook anything they have very good shawerma as well.  Am I not blessed ? :)"}
{"text":"Soup is on the menu. Do they have soup? No. Fish is on the menu. Do they have fish? No. Tuna salad sandwich is on the menu. Do they have tuna salad sandwich? No. I think you get the picture.

There are a number of hot foods available, but they are not listed on the menu, so I needed to ask about them and got very simplistic descriptions.

I tried the lamb stew with mixed vegetables, thinking this would be flavorful and interesting. It was not. Exceedingly bland and over cooked. Barely any flavor at all.

Service was OK, but it seemed they were understaffed, even though there were only five customers in the restaurant area. It wouldn't take too much to make this a much better experience, but the staff and chefs need to try harder to cater to customers, otherwise they won't be customers for very much longer."}
{"text":"Their fresh produce is a lot of times, not fresh. I have seen mold growing on their vegetables. The whole place has an air of unkemptness. It seems like they have too many products and do not know how to keep everything in order."}
{"text":"Ordered catering for a 50+ person event. Wrote a check when I ordered. 

They gave it back and said \"you pay when you pick up.\" 

Called day before event to make sure everything would be ready. They assured me it would be. I confirmed payment due at pickup. They confirmed the amount. 

Called an hour before event to confirm pick up. They said, \"we haven't even started cooking it yet.\"

\"Why?\" I asked.

\"Because you haven't paid yet,\" they said. 

I had to run around town scrambling to get food for the event instead of doing all the other things that needed to be done for a successful event."}
{"text":"Stopped in to pick up dinner from the deli.  Well,  it was a series of unfortunate events for me.  The first few items that I tried to order off the menu, they didn't have.  It wasn't like they ran out because of the dinner rush, they just didn't have it.  Egg salad wasn't even made that day, salami wasn't even in the bldg etc. Just a suggestion - You should probably put up a sign or temporarily cover up those items if you are unable to serve them. The salad bar selection wasn't all that great either, so that was out.  I finally ended up with a sandwich I saw served to another customer and said just give me one of those.  The entire place reeked of smoke, like when your fireplace flue is closed but you try to start a fire anyway.  I think someone with very sensitive asthma would have been in trouble.  On my way out, there was a guy who must have seen the smoke inhalation look on my face (or something), because he said that's from them cooking the kabobs.  Well, whatever its from you need to open ALL of your doors and air the place out when it happens.  I don't see any reason to stop back in here again.  The sandwich I ended up with was ok.   On the plus side, the workers were pleasant."}
{"text":"I do not pretend to know the story behind this location. Looking at the website it looked as though it would be a delight to visit. We offered a simple menu with simple prices. They offered on trees and sandwiches of the same types of food. When we walked in the place was nice enough. 

The prices on packaged goods and produce seemed very reasonable. There were a number of people with in the store. When we went into the deli area and the restaurant area there was very little to choose from. There were no prices on anything listed. Most of the menu items from the online menu were not available. 

I opted not to order from the available hot food as nothing was listed with labels or prices as mentioned before. I took a wander over to the deli and meat section which was almost completely bare (though what they did have was priced well) The only thing this location offers in abundance is pre-packaged goods I'd enjoy trying out."}
{"text":"I'd have given this place 1 star if it wasn't for Jasmina in the meat department. I know some friends who have had very bad experiences with meat there, but I haven't thankfully. They have some good steaks at times and lamb shoulder cuts. The goat meat sometimes has all the meat/fat/bones that is usually discarded or used to feed pets!! 
They have rotten, mouldy veggies in the vegetable section. Some of their snack items are TWO years past the expiry date! There's a Pakistani man who is the least helpful person ever!!! I once asked him to open up a packet of 6 pepper' s because they don't have any smaller ones and he said he can't because 'it's too labor intensive'!!! The nice Arab gentleman had opened it up for me without any problem weeks earlier.
The one good thing about it was that it was on my way home from work and was a quick stop for select groceries"}
{"text":"My one experience here (so far) was perfect. The food was good, everyone else I was with agreed. Prices were fair. It's location right next to Cleveland Clinic is valuable to anyone on campus needing to eat.
This is a place I can grab a bite for lunch and then pick up some groceries for dinner. I recommend stopping by and giving it a try."}
{"text":"Attended a friend's party and they served Mediterranean food - which I'm a big fan of - catered by Rumi's. The food was excellent, so I needed to pay Rumi's a visit to see what else they offer. Nice place... a modern, sleek building nestled in the middle of urban near-east side. Very clean. Was pleasantly surprised to find that they have a grocery. Bought a few items before heading to the restaurant part. Ordered Rumi's Kabob platter for me and Gyro sandwiches for the kiddos. Food was great!

Here's the not-so-great part... as nice as the place was, and as good as the food was, the place seemed very disorganized. In the grocery part, some of the items were in the wrong places on the shelf and you couldn't tell how much things were. Some were poorly labeled and you couldn't tell what price applies to what item. Some items just didn't have a label or price at all. The restaurant part was the same thing. No menus! I was pacing around the serving areas to see what was available, and had a hard time trying to figure out what they were offering. There were display monitors above the ordering area, but they were turned off. I asked for a menu, and they had none available. Finally, someone ended up turning on the monitor and the menu was displayed. Very friendly workers, and - again - food was great, but our experience was just so disorganized. I hope they make it a bit more professional. Although, the quality of the food is enough to bring us back, regardless. A more organized place of business would make our next experience that much better."}
{"text":"I see my zero star rearing its ugly head. 
My brother passes this place everyday and suggested we stop there for some sandwiches and try them out.

So this place is pretty much an indian market and also a deli. Upon arrival saw many varietys of drinks a somewhat Mediterranean bar of olives, pasta salad...etc. Under the display glass was sides such as mac and cheese, sauteed veggies and much more which I can't say looked extremely fresh or appetizing. Their displayed baked goods of cookies and cupcakes looked good. 

Ordering: We looked at their deli menu which had hot sandwiches and cold. I ordered a Turkey Reuben and my brother ordered corn beef and we both ordered fries.  The girl who took our order walked over to the cook/deli guy and told him our order. This was at 3:50pm. 
While waiting we explored the store , was really impressed by the variety of cultural food you could buy here. They do have some regular items as well like Campbell's soup, kraft mac n cheese....etc. Although some of the frozen meats in the display cases were freezer burned and had frost growing on them. About 5 minutes later the girl who took our order runs over to me and says \"ohhh I forgot to ask what you wanted on your reuben?\" ..O_o ...ummm. I ask what comes on \"their Reuben\" she states , turkey. WTF do you have a Reuben on your menu if you don't know what it is? I told her everything that comes on a Reuben.  So she runs all giddy and giggily to tell the guy. 
It is now 4:10pm . We head back to counter and I see no sign of our food. Mind you there were only 3 people at the deli waiting. They all came in after us.  Still no food. Yet everyone who came in after had food. The counter girl laughs and says \"oh your sandwich is still in progress\". I see the deli guy just start to make them..heats them in the microwave yet they have a flat top. 4:15pm  ...At this point I'm ready to scratch the food and leave but I wait patiently.  4:20pm ..finally they are ready and then I see the girl tell the guy \"oh they wanted fries\" and she giggles and runs away to avoid dealing with me. So another guy asks what we ordered to ring us up. I ask how long for the fries and he says 5 min. Umm no. We scratch the fries. I tell the guy 30min for 2 sandwiches is a little ridiculous.  He looked at me like \"blah blah whatever\" and apologized because a deli person didn't show up. WTF does that matter? You had 2 cooks back there and 3 people in the entire place.

WORST customer service I have ever received. Not to mention the sandwich was terrible. They put American cheese on it  when i asked for swiss and bad sauerkraut and the Turkey was hard on the sides from being microwaved. My brothers sandwich had mayo all over it when he asked for none. 

Just overalll terrible experience and a waste of my money. Never again. If they had a product I really needed and another store had it 20 miles away. Needless to say \"vrooooom\" . I won't support such poor customer service."}
{"text":"This place is great and for surprising reasons. We went there thinking it was a good place to pick up some yogurt and pita for some gyros. To our utter surprise, this place has a well-stocked grocery store, and even more unfathomable on this side of the CLE, Indian/Pak groceries! And a LOT of them. They have a whole freezer row of frozen naans I'd never even known existed. They have dry lentils, giant burlap sacks of basmati rice, mango pickle, Maggi chilli sauce (haven't had it? OMFG srsly the best) etc etc, and very cheap produce. We will definitely be back here, it is so
convenient for the Southeast Asian crowd."}
{"text":"I finally checked this place out for breakfast and it was great! Very quiet (I'm sure they have a bigger lunch crowd with the proximity to the Clinic), but bright and clean. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and helpful and I was actually impressed by my tomato/spinach omelet and toast. All in all we spent $12 on two meals and 2 large coffees to go. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We get our meat from here and it has always been good quality meat. They also have a nice selection of teas and spices. Plus they have Indomie noodles, which I can absolutely live off of. I do wish they had more options as far as Pakistani snacks and frozen foods go."}
{"text":"What a great find!

I had always thought this palace was a random deli off of Carnegie. After speaking with a fellow yelper who informed me of it's true identity, I had to stop by this weekend.

Surprise! Rumi's isn't just a deli- it's a middle eastern grocery store!! What???? I exclaimed as I wandered in.., it's huge!

I was pleasantly surprised to find a large selection of middle eastern groceries, desserts, and other items, all at a reasonable price. 


Surprisingly, they actually sell hot food too! We ordered the shwarma and the chicken kebab. Coming from the east side of Michigan (and land of amazing middle eastern food) I thought the food was ok. But it was still good!

If you're ever looking for a quality middle eastern grocery store, definitely stop by Rumi's.. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Watched as this place was slowly built and finally stopped last week for lunch. Very pleasantly surprised. It is a cafeteria style restaurant with plentiful seating. The place looks very clean and styling very cutting edge. Most of all the food is outstanding and reasonably priced.  They have a giant salad bar and a giant olive bar. I had limited time but want to come back and hit the olive bar. There is also a market there I want to check out too. They have a private parking lot with plenty of space.
I was there during lunch and while they are doing well I hope more people come out and support the place.
As a side note...check out the bathroom. I haven't seen such a chichi bathroom  at some of the finer restaurants. It was spotless with granite countertops, marble walls and burnished stainless steel stalls. I wish I had this bathroom in my house."}
{"text":"Middle eastern/Mediterranean diner meets grocery store in the burgeoning area of the Cleveland Clinic. Had the gyro meal with rice and green beans.  Reasonably priced and the space is new and neat with an upscale cafeteria feel to it.  walking distance from my office so that is a plus.  Open for breakfast so will have to give that a whirl.  Had to wait a few minutes for my Gyro meat but looks like they are working out the kinks on their service during lunch.  There is an olive bar with so many variety of olives.  I didn't know you could do that many ways with an olive.  They should have an olive eating contest.  That could be a new neighborhood event.  I'd go back again."}
