{"text":"We ordered All U Can Eat for dinner!
Food- Nothing special. Rolls looked mushy, no distinct flavour
Service- Not the best. Waiter with a stiff face rarely paid attention to our table, forgot to bring  us utensils and wasabi  and we waited for it 15 min looking at the sushi. 
Price: 26 bucks per face plus 15% automatic gratuity! Quite unfair for the level of service we received.
They advertise live music each Saturday, when we came there , no music was played."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the bento box for lunch, cheap, large portion and good quality.

Staff is attentive and super friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and it was A-OK. It's nicely decorated and really does feel like half bar half japanese-y. It seems like a great place to go if you have a large group of people. 

Service was very nice and attentive. Food was good, nothing super special. I had the kalbi bento box and it came with rice, 4 pieces of kalbi on top of veggies, spicy salmon roll, tempura, salad, and miso soup. Also, their soya sauce dispenser was kinda cool! 

I would come and try the other stuff on the menu if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre for the price compared to most Japanese/Korean restaurants. The menu is also kind of overwhelming with way too many options. The AYCE menus can be confusing. But what bothers me the most is the service and standards. 

There have been TOO MANY times we would come here only to find out that they are closing 3-4 hours early when the hours of operation are indicated at the entrance. It's as if they operate their business when they feel like it. They should commit to those hours whether or not it's busy, otherwise they will drive potential new customers away and eventually even the people who live in the area.

I've come here enough to also notice that the manager is pretty much useless. He just floats around the restaurant, not helping his staff run food or take orders and to make it worse he drinks on the job and sometimes gets wasted!! NOT a good impression. A good manager promotes team work and work just as hard as his staff. No wonder the servers look so miserable.

One last thing. Momiji shouldn't promote themselves as a bar when they frequently run out of beers - both bottled and draught. A bar should always be on top of this kind of stuff!

To have a successful business they need to bring up their level of service/standards, consistent with the food including the concept (theme, cuisine, etc). These points I've mentioned are things I've noticed having worked in the restaurant industry for 6 years. We frequent here only because we live in the area and the servers we have gotten to know are welcoming, otherwise go spend your money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"PROS
I love the sushi here. The sushi and sashimi is extremely fresh and melts in your mouth. The Blue Mountain Roll is the best roll I've ever had!! Tuna tataki is also another excellent item on their menu

CONS 
Service is a bit slow. 
Extremely pricey. AYCE dinner on weekends is $25.99 and they automatically charge you 15% gratuity. Bill comes out to $33.27 

BOTTOM LINE 
Pricey but definitely worth it! Food is amazing"}
{"text":"The lunch bento combos are reasonably priced and reasonably filling. Certainly not cheap, even though they're the cheapest thing on the menu. The quality of the sushi is high. Also, they let you get substitutions for the California Rolls (with either spicy salmon or spicy tuna depending on the day), so definitely do this if you get one of the bento combos. Their spicy salmon is amazing, and their sashimi is excellent quality, but I still think it's too overpriced for eating at regularly."}
{"text":"Just. Don't.

The Good:
1. Atmosphere - It was beautiful in there.
2. Presentation/plating.
3. Food tasted good. The soft-shell crab roll didn't disappoint me so thumbs up.
4. Waiter's attempt to soothe our evident confusion and frustration.

The one star is for those four points.

The WTF:
What does AYCE stand for, people? \"ALL YOU CAN EAT\". I was - no, my whole table was - unpleasantly surprised to learn that there were three \"AYCE\" options. Basic, Regular and Premium. We chose the Regular for $24.99 per person. We figured we didn't need all the fancy-schmancy sushi that we couldn't pronounce. Fine. When we tried to order, however, our waiter informed us that the items with the check marks have a limit of ONE ORDER PER PERSON. What the f_ck? (Do forgive me. This is probably my most unprofessional review because I really did have a rather annoying experience with this prissy-looking hole).

So we followed as instructed. What choice did we have? We were already seated and hungry at that. Per my four points, food was presented very well and I have no complaints as to the taste. Come dessert time, however, the waiter informed us that ice cream wasn't part of our chosen package. I would really, REALLY love to give the genius who decided to advertise the place as an AYCE, something that is suppose to be straight-forward and simple, a good kick in the ass. 

We tried to pick the dessert that WAS included in our package only to have the waiter inform us that there wasn't anymore left. LMAO!! Seriously.

I couldn't help but blurt out something along the lines of, \"I have never experienced a more retarded All-You-Can-Eat system.\" One of my friends asked our waiter to ask their manager to replace the out-of-stock dessert with ice cream instead. He came back with positive news however, when I tried to order two scoops of green tea ice cream (I like ordering two scoops even though I never finish it. I don't know why. It just looks prettier in my bowl. I pass the rest off to my fiance to finish. Don't judge me.) he said there is a limit of one scoop per person. LOL! So my friend asked to be brought six orders.

To my surprise, the waiter came back with a bowl of two scoops for me which eased my  annoyance at the whole damn place... well, obviously not enough to stop me from writing this ridiculous review.

Don't waste your time or money. Go to another not-so-fancy looking AYCE and have a better time eating. Mercy.

Oh. And they didn't bring us our shrimp tempura order. What."}
{"text":"Momiji has cute, friendly waitresses in short skirts that will help you to feel at home.  I know this because of guy pals who brought us there and who go there often enough that the waitresses know their names.  Moving on...

The decent food is a bit more expensive that you would expect.  For $16.95 plus tax and tip, I got the Maki Set B that included a dragon roll, spicy salmon roll and California rolls.  The proportions were big and they don't skip on the ingredients like the fresh, chucky avocados.  Yum!  The Kalbi dinner was $18.95 or thereabouts and was flavourful.  It came with a side dark greens salad plus onion rights, yam fries and rice.  However, I found the cuts of meat to be a bit stringy and tough to chew.  I consistently spat out meat fibres after a long while spent chewing.  

There are drink specials pretty much everyday like a $4 blackberry martini on Sunday.  There is also supposed to be entertainment like jazz every Saturday and I hear the place is packed on Fridays, though on the Sunday night it was pretty sparse.

Momiji is in a surprising large and modern space.  They did a great job converting the place from its previous incarnation.  Lots of parking."}
{"text":"The service was atrocious and the sushi sub par."}
{"text":"The place was great.

I came here for a birthday dinner (AYCE) for my friend with a group of about 40 people.

It was a nice setting - good for both casual and professional setting. The food came at a good speed and the waiters were considerate and nice. The food was always excellent. 

Considering the atmosphere of the restaurant and the quality of the food, I'd say it was money well-spent."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on a Saturday night with one of my girl friends and it was amazing! The minute you walk in you're greeted with a warm welcome. The atmosphere is spectacular and, a definite plus, there were numerous TV screens showing hockey!

The food came fast and the waitress checked up on us often enough to make sure everything was ok, but no so often that it was annoying. The sushi and sashimi was really fresh and placed intricately on their plates.

I can't forget to mention that they have a special drink every day. When I went I got the Summer Lady for $4 thinking it would be a relatively small glass, but no it was a huge drink and made the $4 really worth it!

I would definitely come back again and I highly recommend it to everyone :D"}
{"text":"Went here a few days ago. Server didn't get my full order but I worked customer service/serving so I didn't say anything and the white dragon roll that I did receive was very fresh, large sized( almost to large, embarrassing to eat on a date, don't wanna be caught opening your mouth that wide..haha) 

This was the first time I've eaten fish of any kind in over 15 years, it was called \"Snapper\" white fish hence the white dragon name. 

Miso soup was same as any Japanese restaurant, green salad, I'm not generally a fan of, the pieces are too large, I don't like the dressing and it seemed like it was all the white chunks left of the lettuce. 

Decor was really modern, romantic, clean and new looking, loved the candlelight dinner and dark chocolate Coloured setting with fireplace in the middle. Seating was spaced out and there's room for your legs and the person beside you and infront.  Nice staff members, all greet when you enter and leave the place, 

I won't go out of my way to eat here again, but if I'm in the area, it's a good option :)"}
{"text":"I'd like to see this place come up to a 3.5** so I rounded up to 4 stars.

Let me just start by saying I love the atmosphere of this place. It's modern and spacious venue is great for the ambiance for anything from a business lunch to a dinner date. 

I come here for the lunch specials which are anywheres from $9-12 if I'm not mistaken. They are great! The food is top notch, the portions are good, the sushi is fresh and the hot food is tasty. I'd give it 4 stars. Service is also very good and the food arrives quickly.

The only reason I'd be inclined to drop them a star and a half would be the prices for their dinner menu, a la carte selection, as well as the AYCE lunch/dinner. They're expensive. 

Try them out for their lunch specials....and then make your decision about coming back for dinner."}
{"text":"After passing by this place many times in North York, I finally got to go to Momiji for sushi last night (Friday).

The restaurant decor is nice -- it's nicely lit, with a modern flair to it.  We were placed in the back area because we had a large party.

Service wasn't too bad.  Our waitress came by once in a while to check up on us, but didn't really bother to check if we wanted more tea or water.  I was a bit disappointed with that.

I was craving sushi last night, and ended up ordering a Maki dinner B: dynamite roll, california roll, and spicy roll.  I was quite impressed by the  makis that they made.  It was filled with quite a lot of  food.  I was actually quite full by the end of the night.

What I found interesting was that the dinner entrees were plated in a westernized fashion versus a bento box.  My friend ordered the kalbi dish.  It was interesting - it wasn't made with the usual spare ribs, and it had onion rings and sweet potato fries.  Very  interesting take on the kalbi dish at this restaurant."}
{"text":"My son suggested we go to Momiji. We normally go to the Sashimi House which is nearby. So we thought we should give this new place a try. There were four of us and we were expecting a medium scale Japanese restaurant. They had an extensive menu and bar list. But...guess what? half the drinks were unavailable. I ordered a Ceaser. They had no tomato juice! Gosh, they could have walked over to Tim Horton's and bought some tomato juice. I was told they had no cocktails, even though they were listed in the drink menu.I ordered a bottle of Saki (playing safe). They had no bottled sake! So I ordered a pot of their house sake. They had that. We ordered sashimi appetizers. Seven slices of sashimi. Not bad but cheaper at Sashimi House down the street. We ordered Steak Teryaki. The steak was so seared that all you could taste was the bitter char on the outside of the steak. We asked for a dessert menu. They had none, only ice cream. The bill for four was $165.00. Go somewhere else.
You would get a better meal at the Sashimi House."}
{"text":"Should have known from the mostly empty parking lot that this place was not great. Even upon entering, and seeing only 3 other tables occupied should've clued me in. The selection, in comparison to other AYCE sushi places was disappointing, although they had more Korean dishes to select from. Though the sushi was fresh, the jap chae was incredibly salty and disappointing, and the cooked items couldn't really have been screwed up. Overall, it was average. The service, on the other hand, was unbelievably slow, especially considering there were only a few other tables and that it was a Monday night. Also, dessert was not included in the AYCE. There are better options for AYCE out there, will not likely be returning."}
{"text":"I went to Momiji at night wanting to find out what this new restaurant is all about. I was greeted instantly by a friendly waiter who took me to my seat. 

They have a variety of Japanese food to choose from and the food quality is fairly good. 

 At night, their tables are dimly lit with sports games playing on TV providing a bar environment. It's a great place to go if you want to go watch sports games with a group of friends and talk or a place to meet your date.

The only downside to this restaurant at night is the food tends to be priced slightly higher, but the environment and service provided justifies the price."}
{"text":"After driving past this restaurant several times, I decided to dine here with a friend on a Sunday afternoon. 

The decor inside was beautiful, which is the first thing I noticed. I remember a long time ago I went here when it was an Italian restaurant or something. There has been a lot of improvements to the inside of this restaurant. After being greeted and sat in a fairly spacious booth, we took our time looking at the menu's. We got lunch special's, I do not recall what they were called but it was sushi/sashimi. 

We received our orders in a timely manner and server came by to check if everything was alright. Overall, I did not find anything particularly special about this place. Sushi was average, decor was amazing and service was fairly decent. I am not a huge fan of the prices, I felt like it was priced too high for food that was average. I do not think I would come here again. I still prefer Sushi Moto or Tekka Sushi over this place."}
{"text":"The phrase \"You get what you pay for\" comes into mind at this particular restaurant. Although I've experienced better \"all you can eat\" sushi places, this place is pretty much at par with the other ones.  I decided to give this one a chance albeit the fact that I'm not a big fan of \"all you can eat\" places.  

What I really dislike about this place is that they have different \"packages\" of all you can eats.  There are exceptions to this package and exceptions to that package.  It's just insane and confusing.  I feel like they should just have one fixed price so that you can just eat everything. 

Most of their sushi dishes are quite bland and un-memorable.  Their cooked dishes are sometimes overcooked.  Everything is just bleh.  

Service is not that great...you have to flag down people very often.  I also don't appreciate the fact that they slap on a 15% gratuity on certain times of the week.  If someone's service is great, I will eventually give a 15% tip but if it isn't, I feel less inclined to give a full 15% and that's most of the time at this place (I've gone a total of 3 times). 

Will I ever go to this place again? Probably not unless I was absolutely desparate.  It's not a horrible place but I've DEFINITELY had way better Japanese food before."}
{"text":"Service was really really slow, ate the AYCE and took like an hour to get something on the table. The place wasn't even packed. By the time the food came, none of us were hungry anymore so it was waste of $26 per person.

The only good thing about this place is that you get to order Korean dishes like pork bone soup. The sushi was okay.

Sushi fun is a better place to go for AYCE sushi, pay cash and get 10% off,
tips was only 10% unlike Momiji where it's 15% added on to your bill. (like it or not)"}
{"text":"GF and I went here during a weekday evening during the summer of 2011. The food was great but a little on the expensive side. Waitress didn't have great knowledge of the menu but a little had to do with her not understanding my English. 
There's a karaoke bar to use, assuming on Friday and Saturday nights. There's also a nice big patio as well. I remember their spicy salmon rolls being delicious but that might be a bias opinion because I usually love that maki roll. 

I would only recommend this place to people who are curious to try it out. There are other sushi bistros like this a little lighter on the wallet."}
{"text":"Momiji took over the building where The Keg was  and they did a awesome job in transfering the space into a nice, chic and trendy deco Japanese/Korean restaurant.

Momiji reminds me of a crossover between a Milestone and Sushi place, since in the evening it is open till 2 AM on weekends and transfer into a drinking place. 

The outside of the building is not attractive at all. I have driven by so often and did not realize is existence. It is really just a grey looking building with windows and the name of the restaurant on it. 

For lunch it is a busy busy place. There are a lot of people working in offices near by comes here for lunch. The place is full! But here the service is so so fast! I am talking about Food court speed. The kitchen and waitstaffs are trained like an army and my food was deliver to my table in less than 10 min. I do believe since this place is so busy, they just kept rolling the sushi, deep frying the tempura and it is more like they are working in an assembly line keep pumping out food!

The Kalbi lunch bento box ($9.95) is nicely presented. The shrimp and veggie tempura are quite good. There are also spicy rolls and 1 veggie spring roll on the side. Kalbi is not bad.. but I have better one. But it is good value for the prices.

The waitstaffs are all Koreans. So communications here are on minimum level. But they are all nice and polite. Yes kneeling beside your table to take your order and so soft spoken. A lot of young male Korean waitstaffs too, feel like I am in Seoul or something :P

I will probably drop by an evening and try some of their sake or mixed sake drinks!

They accepts Visa and Mastercard. AMEX in the future."}
