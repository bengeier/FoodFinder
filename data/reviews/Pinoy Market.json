{"text":"You should never judge a book by its cover. This store really didn't look like much from the outside (just a single banner covering what seemed to be the signage from the previous establishment), but upon entering I was quite surprised because this little market looked very nice. I think it's bigger than what it seemed; it felt very cozy for sure.  The shelves were all neat and everything was very well-organized. They also seem to have a wider selection of items than other Filipino markets around the area. They basically have all the Filipino basics: frozen bangus, Filipino meriendas (snacks) like Piattos and Rollercoaster potato rings, and different noodles for pancit and palabok dishes!  They also had a section for personal care/cosmetic items. They had Filipino cosmetic staples such as Eskinol and Sunsilk. They had other brands like Dove and Old Spice there, too.  If you continue on towards the back, they had a nice little selection of produce there. Among their selection was: ginger, long green beans, and onions. They had signs and prices out for okra, but I didn't see any there. They also have a good selection of Filipino ice creams and individual soda cans.   Customer service was a bit subpar, the employees weren't really interactive but that's okay because they still greeted us when we came in.  This Pinoy Market offers a wide selection of Filipino groceries. It's super convenient if you don't want to wait long lines at a grocery store for stuff like laundry detergent. I'll definitely come back and shop here for whenever I need anything for my Filipino home cooking or basic household needs.  It's new, but this place looks very promising."}
