{"text":"Wow! Best Mexican food I have ever had. The flavor in every dish I tried was wonderful and such a delight to my taste buds. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. So, sooo good! Will definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"A terrific new family owned restaurant in Phoenix. The menu is extensive and the food is fine. They serve a variety of alcohol, too. People who live in Medford and Ashland will be glad they drove to Phoenix for dinner."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant once and enjoyed it. On our second time there (on a weeknight) we went in and seated ourselves. Several staff members noticed us. We proceeded to sit there for the next 15-20 minutes being ignored, waiting for someone to bring us menus, water, etc. We kept thinking any minute someone was going to give us some service. Then we watched another couple come in, who were greeted and provided menus right away. Evidently they were not interested in our business, so we won't go back. Even though the food is good, customer service is the most important aspect of a restaurant, and that is seriously lacking here."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, plenty of seating. Chips and bean dip when you're seated is a nice touch. Order anything with the pastor and you're on your way. A+"}
{"text":"Great service, attentive staff, reasonable prices and a full bar.  Think we may have found a new fav. Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"El Comal was the first Mexican restaurant we tried in this area and it was love at first bite. No other has come even close to the variety, flavor, friendly service of El Comal--luckiest guess ever dropping in there one night on $1 taco night :-)"}
{"text":"Hands Down!!!!! The best tripa tacos from here in both directions S to Cali and N to Bham WA !!!  Thank you for the excellent customer service and perfect food!  Great horchata, and jamaica!  Good selection of alcohol too! Vey happy customer!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and we'll be back for dinner. Clean, very friendly staff and best of all great food. Lunch, so we had the $1.00 tacos and lunch special. So good we can't wait for dinner.  This is a go to place and not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great place for authentic Mexican food, especially if you're looking for quick stop while traveling along I-5. Super friendly service, cute and clean, and the best tacos Al Pastor I've had.  Easy on and off the freeway to boot. This will become a regular stop for us!"}
{"text":"VERY friendly staff...FRESH  Food...casual and clean...many menu choices.... If you have not enjoyed a meal at El Comal please do and I believe you will really enjoy it... And the enjoyable food does not weigh you down... it's very light and refreshing yet also quite filling..."}
{"text":"Buenos Dias El Comal! I did return with a friend from Mexico last week. We ordered a few items and he LOVED everything. I thought your service and friendliness was AAA+++, as well as yummmi food, We ate EVERY bite! but did your refried beans, which I was in love with change?? They had a different taste and texture last month W/more pork fat and bits of pork meat, it was really unique and I ate ALL beans in my order first time. This time beans were just ok. The rest of my order was SUPER delisious, smokey chicken on nachos, but needed a little more cheese, carne taco muey buen, as was shredded beef wet burrito!Salsa bar is also very good, carrots and onions...MMMM, I will keep trying more dishes, but I still feel a rate of 4 star."}
{"text":"I am a big menudo fan. Hands down they have the best menudo i have ever had. I am from LA, not a stranger for good Mexican food. Their refried beans is the best in southern Oregon. I found them in Yelps based on the reviews. I am glad I came for dinner, I am so full and enjoyed it so much and thinking when I should come back."}
{"text":"We ended up at El Comal because the place we were headed to was closed - boy am I glad they were! This place was terrific! Everything from the dining area, cleanliness, service and food was top notch. We were a party of 5, and everyone was happy with their food. Service is attentive but not overbearing. Overall a pleasant experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Another bummer day of smoke but lunch here brightened my day. It hasn't been a good summer for motorcycling or other outdoor activity between the excessive heat and/or wildfire smoke. Today it looked fairly clear and the temperature was down to the mid-50s so I got set for a half-day ride to some interesting eating place; but as the earth turned toward noon, the smoke drifted in and a much shortened ride ended at El Comal Tacqueria. The chips were accompanied by a thin tomato salsa and refried beans. My machacha burrito was some 6 inches by two filled with pork, egg, peppers and onions. It was very good and filling. The waitress was attentive and refilled the iced tea."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food place in the valley! If you like margaritas, don't leave this place without getting one!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Food is amazing. Staff is friendly  We go at least once a week.  We are creatures of habit so we stick to tacos and margaritas but will start to try new things.  Highly suggest going there"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Not only does the aroma whet your appetite when you first enter, but the food is delicious. I love the service and the dinning area is clean and inviting. Check it out."}
{"text":"Our first time visiting and couldn't have been better. Very friendly service with a great atmosphere. My husbands chili relleno was the best he has ever had! My wet burrito was loaded with chicken. All in all a great meal. We will be back for dinner for sure"}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a week. It's the best & most authentic Mexican in the rogue valley. Highly recommend this spot. Soooo much better than the La Tapitio in Phoenix (that place smells & tastes like cheap cleaning supplies)."}
{"text":"We ate here last night and all the food was delish. We started with the Cadalic Maragaritas and some beer. The Maragaritas were awesome. Our group had the chile relano burritos,  beef cheek tacos, chile Colorado , menudo and the bacon wrapped shrimp.  All the food was delicious. First time here and it wont be our last."}
{"text":"Such wonderful food, delicious flavors with each meal. Great carne asada. Friendly service, warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great service and quality food. Plus you get a complimentary scoop of ice cream at the end.   Edit: Also, great vegetarian options. Got the veggie burrito... Came with caramelized onions, whole pinto beans, guacamole(!!!), and more."}
{"text":"So awesome we live practically next door to this taco place. Tacos are great. They don't skimp on the meat, even on taco Tuesday and Thursday. We know what we want for dinner on Tuesday's and Thursday's!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were looking for another Mexican restaurant to replace the one we went to for years and we found one!  El Comal is a very authentic Mexican restaurant and I know what I'm talking about, being Hispanic and growing up with great Mexican eats. My favorite thing to order is chorizo con hue is and this chef even puts tomatoes in it...just like my mom used to make!  Please give this little mom and pop a try and you won't be disappointed. Muy sabroso! Thank you El Comal!"}
{"text":"Great food, amongst most authentic in the Valley. Right down the street from La Tapatia.  Fresh, clean new atmosphere inside, VERY friendly folks.  Will return!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and service was good as well. Ordered several different dishes everyone walked away very happy. Chicken tortilla soup is definitely no joke. Tacos were good, fajitas were also good. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"So happy they chose our little neighborhood in Phoenix. Food is great. Family owned and great/friendly service.  I only wish they did a ceviche mixto and they would have hand 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"We visited again tonight and once again it was delicious. I ordered carne asada and mike got a Torta. This was a really good meal. The restaurant is close to home and will fast become a favorite. The folks working here are super nice. They remembered us from our last visit. It makes me feel good when you walk into an establishment and they say welcome back and genuinely mean it. We had enchiladas and Arroz con pollo on our last visit.  We will be back again for this menu. It is more authentic than the new restaurant taking Si Casas place up the street. This will be our new close to home Mexican restaurant that we'll go to. It's worth giving a try and if you want something tasty and authentic tasting."}
{"text":"We drove from Ashland here for lunch. Totally worth the drive!!! So yummy. I had the wet burrito for 11$. It would absolutely feed two people. They have the best salsa. It's fresh and just the right amount of spice. We also had street tacos and fajitas all very very good. The Cadillac margarita is a must. It's 11$ and comes in a nice frosty glass. A huge bonus is their tortillas, they are fresh! Totally recommend"}
{"text":"Great food. Little \"hole in the wall\". Guacamole was fantastic, warm chips, Cadillac margarita...YUM!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and an all around fun place to take the family for a reasonably priced meal."}
{"text":"I am Mexican, so I am very picky about Mexican food. This place has great tacos, definitely aI will come back."}
{"text":"Food was good and fresh (had the spicy shrimp dish) and a complimentary dessert was served at the end of our meal. The service was really good and the staff members were friendly and cheery throughout!"}
{"text":"Recently moved from LA, CA to this town So far my fav Mexican restaurant. The staff is great very attentive and the food is good! I had the Campechana and a michelada which was really good. I also had there tacos al pastor which they were great, the only thing is that they were a little too salty for my taste but that's just me, I don't eat much salt. The atmosphere is good, very clean place which I love."}
{"text":"Pollo a la crema is delicious. Never had a Mexican dish like it, and I loved it. Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Mexican. Great service. Definitely coming back. Also great prices"}
{"text":"We came on $1 taco Thursday's and also ordered the coctel de camaron. Everything was great. We also really enjoyed the red salsa and chips, not too greasy just right. We came back a few days later and had the steak fajita burritos to go. This is definitely our new fav spot, and thank goodness! We were starting to get worried that we wouldnt be able to find Mexican food that can measure up to our taquerias in CA!"}
{"text":"I finally stopped in for lunch and I am glad I did!  I have tried many Mexican restaurants in the area and have been disappointed.   Chips were warm and served with salsa and refried beans to dip.  I ordered the lunch special ground beef enchilada. The meat was flavorful and sauce delicious, beans were ordinary and the rice was a bit overcooked.  Service was given with a smile. The only thing I would change is not using a microwave.  I watched the cook take my plate out of it.  I prefer an oven. Not enough to keep me away though. I'll be back!"}
