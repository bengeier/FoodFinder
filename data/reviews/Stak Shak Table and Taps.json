{"text":"Excellent food and service. David provided excellent service and great insight to the menu and food selections. The entire staff was friendly and helpful. Chef came out and talked with people. Great and festive deco. Seems like a lot of neighborhood folks which makes for a great feeling. So many great things on the menu to try, will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I had the BLTE and husband had a huge shrimp Po Boy.  Both came with yummy chips.  We each had a beer and shared a huge slice of housemade apple pie.  We had the place to ourselves so great for conversation but I was nervous the food was going to suck because it was empty. Very pleased with the food. Decent draft beer selection. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We stopped in for drinks and dinner and loved this place. The Moscow mules were delicious and they had a good happy hour option too! I got the macaroni and cheese with chicken and it was so so yummy. Will definitely stop back again...We sat in the back but the bar looked great so we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Meh....  We met friends for dinner here and were under-whelmed.  The waitress (Erin I think) was wonderful - very attentive, but the menu and décor was boring/childish.  There menu was pretty limited and odd so I opted for a fish sandwich.... they had run out.  Sigh.
The odd ?plastic? chairs and tables made me feel like I was at McDonalds.  For such a great location, it seems like it could be a little nicer restaurant with nicer décor and better food options.  The bar seemed nice, but nobody was there that particular Saturday night."}
{"text":"This place is such a great find for the area. Really nice people working here, fun comfort food and I really like the ambiance. The night I was there, the music was very cool. The fried pickles and cauliflower are not the healthiest but SUPER yummy!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The potato salad is like, unbelievable.  So good.  Waitress was soooo nice.  Everyone in our group said their food was awesome.  We will def be back.  The klink Sammy was bomb.  Cheeseburger was fabulous.  Even the grilled cheese was recommended by my mom.  Go here."}
{"text":"Place was pathetic!  Way too over priced for what you get. $15 for a Reuben.....with chips.  Reuben was soggy .   Kids menu was misleading, ordered Tater toy casserole which we're tater tots with half cover with sprinkled cheese and a few pieces of crumbled bacon all for $7.   Slaw was chopped cabbage with literally no flavor.   Kettle chips suck!  Cold and burnt.  Terrible atmosphere!!!  They painted the Tuscan inn red  and added large light bulb filled lettering on the wall and try to pass it off as a hip bar which simply doesn't work.  Go elsewhere.!!"}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to trying this place out. Finally got a chance Saturday.
Really great atmosphere, love the look of the bar. The first sign of trouble however was that their 12 tap system was half empty. Second sign was that the restaurant itself was pretty empty as well. Especially for a Saturday night. We we're seated promptly and addressed quickly by our waitress. My wife decided to try the Sangria. It was little more than white wine with some berries thrown in it. Watered down and not very good. Had the pretzel and cheese appetizer. Pretzels were great, but the beer cheese had no flavor. For entrees we selected the lobster roll and chicken and waffles. 
Lobster roll was a little on the chewy side and tasted just slightly \"off\". The chicken and waffles was covered in a dull flavorless gravy that rendered it inedible. My son had chicken tenders and fries that tasted as if the oil they were fried in needed changed.
All in all, a disappointment and at a price point that is only justifiable if the food were fantastic.
The menu is interesting, but was not executed well.
Additionally, we were told one of the beers on the limited draft list was out, then heard the waitress telling another table that an item on the menu had not been available for months, a beer they wanted was not available, and when delivering the bottle beer they ordered she said, \"That's the last one\".
It's a shame to see another locally owned non chain restaurant not executing like this."}
{"text":"Cool place. Service was good as well as the food. Beer selection needs expanded, wasn't impressed by the local only selection."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Sat at the bar. Friendly & fun atmosphere. Great staff - bar tender & servers both were very easy to talk with. 
Drink selection and craft beers were plentiful. Very knowledgeable staff. 
Cauliflower, which is a unique appetizer was a wonderful choice. There's a sauce that is drizzled over it that makes it pop. Definitely give it a try.
I had a Reuben and my husband had a huge sandwhich. 
We loved sitting at the bar in the front of the place. It has an odd little counter space to eat at  with another space kind of elevated a bit above it where servers can place your drink in front of you. At first it seems odd, but it works. 
Definitely will make a return visit!"}
{"text":"Terrific local place - FINALLY. full of great twists on comfort food favorites. Locally supplied ... plenty of home-made options at the bar - Diane's own liquors, bitters, etc. try it and pass the word."}
{"text":"Met here with a work group. Our server and the manager were very attentive and the atmosphere was great. The food was delicious; had the Bang-Bang Cauliflower and the Fish and Chips. The location was perfect for our meeting!"}
{"text":"We thought we would try the new place. 4:30 pm on a Saturday. Place was empty. Loved the decor however the chairs are very uncomfortable, had to take my wallet and phone out of my back pockets just to sit down. Had the cauliflower ap ok but not worth the price. Fish tacos were terrible covered with mayo. Had a good ipa on tap. Will not be back."}
{"text":"The service was just ok. The beer selection wasn't great. The room to eat was extremely tight. The French onion soup was a hit."}
{"text":"This new restaurant where Tuscan Inn used to be is not bad but it's also not good and raises the question, \"why?\"  They took a cozy space in a stone and log cabin exterior and turned it into something with the feel of a fast food restaurant furnished by a Swede who shopped at IKEA. The pricing is all over the place.  We were happy that they had $2 off appetizers on a Saturday evening, but stumped by the $17 fish and chips and $19 chicken and waffles. These are not typically expensive ingredients and this ain't no gastro pub. We opted for nachos, grilled cheese ($9) BLT with egg ($10) A fish sandwich and \"power slaw\" ($3). And tater tots($3). The sandwiches come with homemade chips. The fish sandwich came with fries.  The stak in the name is from sticking a large toothpick through sandwich halves thus stacking one on top of the other. The sandwiches were fine. Nothing at all special. The chips were a little too brown. The tater tots were fine-literally just a small bowl of tots- no spin at all.  The fish had good flavor but it was just a little piece of fish on a bun-in Pittsburgh!  We're used to that big (huge) piece of fish on our sandwiches. This was a very small piece. The fries were well cooked and well seasoned. The slaw was honestly tasteless. I guess it was vinegar based but it didn't even taste like vinegar. It tasted like nothing.  Oh the nachos were blah blah blah. I liked the cheese; others didn't. So back to \"why?\"
 Why does this restaurant exist?  -it did not bring anything new and was priced higher than other restaurants with the same fare. And the atmosphere is cold and austere"}
{"text":"For a first visit, I would say the experience was just so so. They weren't busy so we got our food fairly quickly, but the menu doesn't have a lot of options. When I say not a lot, I'm just comparing to other restaurants. I had no problem finding something, but my boyfriend is a picky eater and he felt he only had a few things to pick from.

I had the monte cristo and I had asked to sub fries for the chips. He had the chicken and waffles. Both tasted great. I ended up getting chips and fries I am guessing by mistake. 

I think that this place is overpriced. His chicken and waffles was priced at $19. My sandwich was reasonable, but when I subbed out the chips for fries, I was still charged $3 for the fries instead of an up charge like most places do. 

We were given a coupon for our next visit, but it expires in a month, and it would actually bring the final bill down to a reasonable range."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday night for dinner. Service was a bit slow considering the place was practically dead. The decor has been totally transformed from the previous restaurant so it is very modern. They added a great back room with all windows that would be perfect for a party.

Our party of 6 ordered a variety of sandwiches and salads. The sandwiches are huge! The Reuben was loaded with meat! I had a salad and added the steak which was definitively the highlight. It was flavorful and cooked perfectly. Crab cakes are always a gamble but it was actually good and not just full of breading filler. 

Overall, we were all very satisfied with our meals. It is a bit pricey for \"lounge food.\" While we won't be regulars, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent and flavorful food with a nice atmosphere. Don't get stopped at the bar; go further through a diagonal hallway that will take you to a cozy room with a fireplace and an adjoining room that is all glass and looks out into the forest. Both the food and the drink menu offered a wide range of prices and selections. We had a special chicken dish with portobello mushrooms and spinach, as well as The Parisian sandwich. Both were excellent, and we're looking forward to stopping by again to try the lobster roll and fish tacos. Every staff member was helpful and friendly. The only thing that could be improved is the seating - the metal chairs give the place a cold feeling...but we will still stop back for the food. Better chairs, though, would make it a favorite spot for us."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice and the feel of the place was also nice. The staff was very friendly. There aren't a lot of options on the menu and I think some of it is way overpriced for what it was. I ordered a French toast martini and it was not sweet at all. I couldn't even drink it. My husband ordered a dark and stormy and it was pretty good. Food wise - I had the Ruben and it was good....very greasy but it was a generous portion. My husband had the fish tacos. They were very large and very deep fried. I am not a huge fan of greasy deep fried food so I didn't really like it but my husband said it was pretty good. It was an ok night out but honestly we probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Great place, food and friendly staff. Burger with blue cheese was so delicious. Potato salad is a must. Coming back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in after walking the lake.  Great Cauliflower app and the hot turkey Sammie and fish tacos were great. Didn't  have a drink but will be back. Friendly staff who explained the history of the house.  Best of all it's an independent business in Hampton. We need more new restaurants!  Worth the short drive off Route 8"}
{"text":"Was a little worried going in because of some negative reviews but I have to say, we thoroughly enjoyed our meal at The Stak Shack. My sangria was perfect, light and fruity but not too sweet and my husband enjoyed the beer. We got the kid's Mac and cheese for our 2 year old, the regular Mac and cheese for our 11 year old, the fish tacos for me (amazing!) and the Monte Christo for my husband with onion soup and the baked chip appetizer to share. All the food was delicious, and hearty portions. The Mac and cheese in particular has a really lovely flavor and depth. Our server and the manager were so attentive and friendly even when my toddler were having a \"toddler moment\" and we felt welcome and comfortable. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to the Stak Shak tonight and I am so excited this new stop is in town! We ordered the Potato Chip Bake and it was awesome. Fresh made chips and cheese...so good. I ordered the Colonel Klink stak and honestly...it might be the best of this reuben style sandwich I have ever had. My husband got the lobster roll and he said it was pretty good. We had to go for dessert of course. We ordered the butterscotch brownie a la mode to share...and it could have served 4! But again, super great ice cream, warm steamy brownie and whipped cream. We were stuffed from dinner but if we would have skipped it, we would have been sorely mistaken. Cool vibe, they must have had a Mitis or other indie EDM Pandora/Spotify playlist running and that gave it a feel that made us feel like we were somewhere we could actually hang. Attentive, really sweet waitress and the manager stopped over twice to check in. A little pricey for the menu style, but seems worth it. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A group of 5 stopped last night after work for a few drinks and to check the place out. The place was quiet with several workers sort of standing around.  There has been extensive work in the old Tuscan Inn to modern up the place. We sat at the bar, which has more of a diner feel than a bar setting. You feel like you are sitting really low in comparison to the bartender who sort of hovers over you. They have a nice happy hour($2 off drinks and appetizers). I like that they support the local brewers by having East End and Grist house available as draft selections. We ordered pretzels and pickle spears as appetizers. They were ok, but nothing great. 

I can't comment on the meals as we only stopped in for a few drinks, but overall it was only ok."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this place, just trying to get a quick bite to eat.  I loved all the beers on tap.  It was a nice variety.  I had the vegetarian chili, and The Pioneer, which was a huge pastrami sandwich.  All the food was so fresh and very good.  I will defiantly be back.  Give it a try!"}
