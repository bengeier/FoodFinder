{"text":"Waiting time was too long. About 1h 30 mins, we tried to book by phone around 5:30pm but no one picked up the phone. however, the taste is quite good. Will go there again but with the reservation."}
{"text":"Bait and switch!

We ordered 1 main for fish/chicken combo which is 1.5lb fish + 1 lb chicken , and they end up giving us a much bigger fish and not giving us a heads up that they will be charging more coz they gave us a bigger fish

In all fairness, she brought out a fish for us to see, but I don't know how many pounds it is... Until the bill arrived and it was actually 3lbs so they effectively charged us two orders without giving us a heads up

Not cool, not coming back"}
{"text":"The price was higher than normal, and they even missed a few dishes we ordered but still charge us. Fish tasted not fresh, I'm not sure if it because of the way they cook it, and the fish soup was salty. Not going there twice definitely."}
{"text":"Delicious fish soup bases and the fish is very fresh and soft. After your fish dish is finished, you can do regular hot pot (ingredients chosen by a la carte). Usually I don't drink soups in hot pot or noodle dishes but this one does not come off as oily or salty and very easy and nice to drink down. 

The steam pot also cooks really quickly which is great. Lots of nice appetizers to choose from as side dishes too - spicy squid and fried tofu were my favourites."}
{"text":"The fish are fresh, Even my baby like it. I like the original favor. The waiters are very nice and friendly too."}
{"text":"I came with a friend on Saturday at 6:30 pm and there were six tables of two until us. We were told it would take twenty minutes so we walked around the different plazas checking out menus, wasn't bad at all :) But when we went back these two scary loud customers kind of took over two tables and made this other pair sit at a separate table...The place is pretty small with maybe ten steam pots? All the waitresses spoke mandarin mostly and although being cantonese i understood their mandarin more than their english. They all tried super hard though and were very funny and friendly! 

Now onto the food! The sea bass is 26 dollars per pound but they told everyone that their smallest was 2.5 pounds, so it was like $75 for a fish. Honestly, i dont think i would do it again because its way too expensive for what you get. The fish was fresh but not worth $75. The original broth was very creamy, light and fragrant. We were definitely not full after the fish. We had a lot of typical hot pot items like meat filled fish balls (very well seasoned and juicy), beef tripe (tender but not soft), udon (thick and chewy) and chinese baby cabbage (perfect to soak up the broth)! These items were all fairly inexpensive. We also got a sweet and sour radish cold side dish for 2 dollars! Such a good portion. We also made our own sauce mix at the back table! No cross contamination no peanut allergy!

Only reason its three stars is because of the very high price. I would expect to spend at most $30 per person for what we got to be honest. Indeed delicious though!"}
{"text":"Delicious high pressured steam fish pot!! If you have no idea what that means, don't worry, neither did I before I had a taste of this delicious yunnan specialty!

This is basically like a combination between fresh steamed fish and hot pot - complete with a bunch of sauces to dip to your hearts content. 

First, they put a fresh fish in the pot with some herbs like ginger,dates, and broth and steam it in this cool bamboo looking contraption which seals in all the goodness. 5 minutes later, voila! You now have a very flavorful fish broth!

Second, they put in a bunch of ingredients like veggies and seafood that you pre-pick  upon arriving, to capitalize on the left over fish broth . Wait 30 seconds, and you now have cooked veggies to eat a la  hotpot style. 

Extremely healthy and efficient way of eating! 

Yunnan fish pot, you are my new survival spot for winter."}
{"text":"My family and I didn't even get a chance to eat here. We made a reservation (for 14) and the staff double booked our reservations. When we arrived, we were told the big table was for our group. We were there before the other group (their group hadn't even arrived yet, it was just 3 of them) and because they pressured the waitress, she ended up giving away our table to them. They were going to give us a small table that fits 4, for 14 people. 

This place is basically just hot pot but the cool thing is, you throw in your food and you put the cover on top to steam the food. I wish we got a chance to try this place out but unfortunately, their service ruined our appetites and we left."}
{"text":"This place is basically steamed fish + hotpot. They definitely overcharge for the fish but it did taste very fresh. We ordered the green bass and requested to have a smaller size fish so they ended up giving us one that was 1.6 lb. We chose the original soup base which tasted very delicious after they used it to make the fish. 
We also ordered some other items for hotpot. Pretty standard but the soup made all the difference. If you're into steamed fish, would recommend this place but expect to pay $100+."}
{"text":"I don't know why everyone says the service is bad. You cannot go into a Chinese restaurant expecting them to cater to western standards of service.

Maybe because I went at a later time so it was quiet but it was our first time there and they were very courteous and explained it to my mom and I how to order and how pricing works. It was a little bit expensive for 2 and we couldn't finish all the food but that was our fault for only having us 2. The food was good, service was good. Would recommend anyone who likes steamed fish and soup!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the dinner at this place. Service is good, fairly clean .  Because everything is in the steam pot , it only takes 4 minutes to cook, so we got to eat very soon after we sat down. We ordered a pot with fish and chicken with some vegetable , very fresh and delicious ! The soup from the pot is a must try! Anyways , it is a very unique and wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I knew it was going to be some fresh fish when they came and showed me my live fish in a net as I ordered.   This steamed pot is so super hot that it allows the fish to be cooked fast and perfectly (and your hot pot after uses the same soup base. Mmm). Fun experience - check my video of the ordeal."}
{"text":"Wah..can't believe this is not on yelp yet.

I was trying to look for a review on Yelp but was shocked to see there was none before I went to try this place in the end.

This is a very unique food business concept - the first of its kind in Ontario where food is quicklt steamed within a few minutes.

 For those who are health conscious, this is 100% healthy cooking with no oil being added at all. 

You select whatever u want to eat on a paper sheet and the staff brings over the food ingredients to be  steamed, placing the food on a nearby table cart. 

Definitely a cool factor with the steamed basket

The soup base they used is very unique. Cooking the fish with the soup is a great accompaniment ..the soup was so good, we could not stop drinking it.

The soup does gets refilled for the second round of cooking.

The restaurant is very small and there are no reservations."}
{"text":"My first time trying this - def recommend if you like steamed fish, soup, and new experiences, but it can get pretty pricey (~$50pp)

Between 2 people, we shared 1 fish (~3 lbs), 1 order each of beef and watercress, and one side dish of cold garlic cucumber. The watercress is an excellent pairing with the fish & soup, but small portion. 

The steamer cooks the fish pretty quickly, roughly 2 minutes. Very fresh and good texture. The soup is good but I wish the fish flavour would be stronger - it gets better after the 2nd round of cooking (the beef & veg)."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants where the experience is critical to the meal. We came in around 8pm on a Sunday night, and still had to wait around 15 minutes.

When you are first seated, the pot is already boiling. We ordered two rounds - a live bass and a mixed vegetable combo. A waitress comes and cleans the pot for you, which results in a huge sizzle-fest of steam. They then pour some broth and let the fish steam for *exactly* four minutes. I loved how the broth ended up very saturated with the flavour of bass. They then clean out your pot, and add the next round of ingredients. Both rounds were quite delicious.

Service was fine at the beginning, but there was a huge pause in the middle (I don't know if we were required to inform them that we were done with the fish). However, our waitress was very conversational, so I would give the service a thumbs up overall. 

I don't normally go to restaurants for hot pot, and I definitely wouldn't pay upwards of $35/person for such a meal. However, this restaurant offers a good one-time experience."}
{"text":"The fish is quiet tasty and clean. The service is nice as well. The price is quite expensive if you only have 2 people. The fish starts from $26.8 per lb and even the smallest fish is about 3lb. So you r looking at $70 min. With additional vegetables and noodles it's approx $100"}
{"text":"It's a unique place to eat but the food is nothing too different from other Chinese hot pot place. The service is not very good either. We reserved a table on a weekday at 7pm and we waited half an hour to get seated. Once we got seated, they had to clean the pots while we were seated. While I was watching them clean, I can see how dirty the pot and the lids are. There were leftover bits of food on the pots and lids. I can't see how anything here is that sanitary.... Also, this place is so expensive. For the stuff you're getting, I don't think it's worth it."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the steam fish and soup made from the fish. It's so flavorful and definitely worth a try! If you have a big appetite then come here as you can do hot pot right after the steam fish! The way they do the steam fish and hot pot is from what i've seen the most technological advance way to do it! Large selection of items to pick from, which is always good. Definitely would come here again!"}
{"text":"Great place for some good beer and steam fish. Love the family. Try the steam fish and hot pot!"}
{"text":"For a price tag of over $100 for two people i would expect a 5 star dining experience but this was far from that. Worst place ever wish i never came here and totally regret my decision. The food here is mediocre. I mean they steam fish in a soup base you select in front of you. Not sure why people think it's such a novel concept. However not worth the price tag - the bill for fish, soup base, and the sides of cabbage and vermicelli, with coke came to over $100 for two people. $100 are you kidding me!!?? The service sucked for this kind of a price tag, the owner was rude and barely spoke English. They didn't explain to us how we were supposed to cook the sides since the sides were brought in after they had already cooked the fish in with the soup base. They were very rude and immediately turned argumehtative when we asked if we could return the sides - seriously arguing over $5 worth max of sides when we're already paying over $100, so in the end we ate that cost even though we didn't even touch it. hello? service anyone? TLDR do not spend over $100 for horrible service and food-court caliber food that you can get elsewhere for less than half that."}
{"text":"I really think it's one of the most interesting concepts for eating steamed fish. Took them a total of 4 minutes to make the fish in the pot. Remember to drink the soup after the fish steaming."}
