{"text":"Went on a Wednesday Night and the place was empty, maybe 2 - 4 tables there.    Here's what we order: 1) Fresh fish - AJI - Sashimi - ~20 thin slice ($20) - Added Soup using the fish bone($4) Review:  It was ok, don't think they really use AJI fish bone for the soup; the fish was fresh - thankgoodness  2) Salted Chicken Wing on a skewer - we ordered 2 ($6) Review:  Remind me of the Northern China Style - nothing special  3) Dancing Unagi Roll ($10.8) Review:  crispy rice inside the maki was soggy  4) Torched Mayo Salmon Sushi ($11.50) Review:  Too much rice and too little fish - Torched Mayo was not good  Total $52.30 before tax for the both of us - not worth it."}
{"text":"We have been there twice. The first time we mainly ordered sashimi and sushi. Then in our 2nd visit,  we tried the cooked food such as Yosenabe ,  sukiyaki, yaki udon. Etc.  Contrary to the bad review, we find the food and service very good. We would definitely go back and try other stuff."}
{"text":"Can totally tell that is a Chinese run Japanese Izakaya though they have been trying to hire some Japanese staff..  Service was not too bad overall. I went there at around 7ish! one down side is that there is one women (probably is the owner/manager, totally under-dress and and serve like ALL you can eat Japanese buffet style..)..ruined the mood a bit...  Food Price and Quality: Sashimi are fresh..quality are great!   other dishes are average (better than all you can eat quality yet lacking the finesse of Japanese owned restaurant)  Around 15-20 per person,, we ordered sashimi Platter (15 pieces), raman (trying to fill ourselves, soup looks great), Tempura, two skewers, one fried squid, takoyaki, takowasa (all of these are probably only average)... left everyone Healthily filled (70% full)    NO way this is a 4-5 star resto...  but for sure a good place for the hip 20-30yrs old to bring their 50-60s yrs old parents for \"an izakaya experience\" at special occasions."}
{"text":"Sushi or sashimi wasn't all that good for the price. Rice was really wet and maki was not done well ( roll completely separated itself when picked up).   Service was great and pleasant"}
{"text":"Horrible! This place is located right by the building that I work at. I have been here once when they just opened and once today both times for lunch. I will never ever return! Let's start with the fact that this place is totally overpriced. I don't care how fancy the place looks its in an office area on a business plaza and people come for lunch and takeout.  I came today after being disappointed at the service and quality of food the last time because it has been a while and I figured how bad can it be I'm just getting some food to go. I was so wrong! I ordered the beef teriyaki from the waitress who seemed to be absolutely not interested to serve me, I assume since this is takeout and there won't be a tip out of this for her. I paid $12 with taxes which is okay but it was the ONLY lunch menu item for that price, everything else was pushing $20. I waited HALF AN HOUR to get my food! I have not once been told how long it will take, not an apology, nothing. At the half hour mark I got fed up and expressed my unhappiness to the waitress. She said it's coming, ran to get it and gave it to me without a word. No sorry, no thanks, no nothing.  My beef teriyaki ended up being an over done piece of stake that tastes like carton, with the same quality rice. It says that all lunch menu items come with a soup and a salad, none of these were in sight.  I didn't bother arguing since I was hungry and had limited time and wanted to save my nerves, but I will never ever ever ever come here again ever and will tell this to anyone who will listen. And I work in an office with 250 employees, all potential clients.  Maybe the management should really reconsider how they do things, seems that the place is mainly always empty."}
{"text":"Overall, the food is okay, not amazing.  Taste is too strong, typical Chinese-style Japanese food.  Service was acceptable, ambiance is nice.  We ordered quite a few dishes for the two of us.  Oyster with Mayo: quite yummy, but I was a little surprised that each order was only one oyster. Dancing unagi (maki): pretty, but the crispy rice inside the maki was soggy Dragon eye (maki): it was great, but some pieces were tiny and some were huge  Salmon tataki: very tasty Beef Cheese age: beef was overcooked, otherwise good Yang's don: super salty   The bill came up to about $65 before tips. It's on the pricier end even for an izakaya."}
{"text":"Went on a sunday night for dinner and the place was empty! maybe 2-4 other tables there. I thought it would be packed. But any place that isn't so good can not expect much customers.  I probably will not return.  it seems like cooked japanese food that I can find at any Japanese restaurant in the GTA rather than a real Izakaya. the uni and ikura did not seem fresh, but since the place is pretty empty, they probably can not get rid of the fresh sashimi quick enough.  There prices are fair but I little on the higher side. After we had the dinner we kind of realized we can get better food from an AYCE and for cheaper!  The service was normal, there was only 2 waiters, if this place was busy, I don't know how they would be able to handle.  The decor is this place is beautiful! But I think they made it too nice for this place that I don't think will last too long. there is not business."}
{"text":"Bad service + tasteless, below average sashimi+ arrogant boss= worse than all-you-can-eat buffet experience.   The boss is so full of himself he kept thinking customer knows nth about Japanese cuisine. He tried to trick my group into ordering an Aji and a common fish that are overpriced at $170. Like c'mon, Inakaya/Shinobu/Jabistro/Hiro offer much greater selection and more exotic fishes at a lower price than this chinese-owned \"izakaya\".    Dun be fooled by their commercial Though they promoted their place to be running by a jap chef, I bet he is so bad he got kicked out of Japan. Their robayaki skewers are either dry, tasteless or bland. The grilled chicken skin are so unseasoned and dried that it became chewable like a piece of fried gum.  The omakase sashimi set was the worst. At $60 for 25-30 pieces. We at least expected some BC spot sweet shrimps, Hokkaido scallops and uni. But instead we were treated with the mediocre \"dead\" fishes such as salmon, tuna and octopus. The better sashimi were hamachi  but those were not fresh and weirdly cut. Even the salmon were not salmon belly but just some dull-colored side cut of salmon with not much distinctive white lines of fat.   I am so surprised this place can last for even a month in this city where there are better Japanese restaurants. Just don't come here.."}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant with rude waiters, arrogant boss, mediocre food and overpriced menu."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday, table of 5.   Ordered several items for variety, sashimi 5 kinds ($24), a Lucky Roll, Sake Clams, Assorted Mushrooms, Beef Sukiyaki, and I forgot the rest.   YAY: - Great service, although slow and a bit understaffed, our waitress was way above average for a Chinese owned Japanese restaurant. Great with suggestions and super friendly bubbly. Almost unheard of!  - Presentation, everything looks great. Food, decor, visual ambience. Lots of details put in.   NAYS: - food was disappointing. Sashimi was alright and izakaya items were ho hum to meh.  - tables are horrible! our table was 3 small tables put together but because of the A-shaped legs, i could barely put my legs in to the table. Chairs were low back deep seats too, horrid comfort.  - visual ambience is great but not audio. Poor sound system set up and not izakaya-style vibe/music. Music was heard faintly from the far end of the restaurant, not memorable.   AND....I won't come back unless someone invites me and no other choice given...My back hurts and the whole time I was thinking of all the better places for less money and more enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Overpriced and totally not worth the experience! That's how I would describe Yang's Izakaya & Japanese Cuisine.  Drinks menu is expensive and with limited in Sake selections and cocktails.   Food selections are A-OK with the usual Japanese Izakaya snack selections.   We ordered:  Sashimi 5 Kinds ($15)  - some of the pieces were stuck together - fish quality was meh, cut is really thin - Pass  Dancing Unagi ($12.80) - Nicely presented and delicious - love the rice crackers inside the roll - but for a roll at that price with only 4 pieces??   Tempura Udon ($8.50) - Batter is light and crispy - Shrimps cooked well with good bite - Udon is nicely prepared in a savoury broth - The best dish of the night  Gyoza ($6.50) - Dried, overcooked and some of wrapping were burnt and gave the dumplings a bitter taste - Filling has not texture.. just mushy..like puree - I definitely won't order that again!  Yang's gave me this vibe of trying to be a trendy Izakaya but is falling short in every aspect. Food is really below par with the price they are charging.. nothing authentic at all.. not a good Izakaya and not a good Japanese restaurant.."}
{"text":"Beware. This restaurant is definitely on the expensive end. It has a fancy atmosphere to it so you pay for that I guess.  Pros: Best beef tataki I've ever had. Good selection of rare/high-quality fish to choose from. I seem to be in disagreement with the other folks here but I think the overall food quality is noticeably higher than other Japanese restaurants.  Cons: Many of the food was not worth it for the price (don't order the udon. it's so expensive for the small portion they give you). The service was pretty bad. No one was rude but I just didn't feel welcomed when I walked in. It didn't help they were understaffed for the night as people didn't show up to work (that was the excuse the boss told us) so our sushi took extremely long to come.  I want to go back and give the other food a try but the price is a real deterrent. I would recommend this restaurant if you are looking to try expensive fish. You can choose one from the sushi bar and you have options with how you want it served (soup, sashimi, etc.)"}
