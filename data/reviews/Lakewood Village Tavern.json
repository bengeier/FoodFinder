{"text":"I love this place. Its the area dive bar and it couldn't be more perfect. The crowd is a mix of all different types. The service is excellent and the food is cheap.  Karaoke every Sat night as well."}
{"text":"Best bar food in Lakewood and the owner's good people. Get the jerk wings or brisket when they have it. Awesome"}
{"text":"My boyfriend's roommate is basically a regular here, and he suggested we go here last Saturday for some drinks and food. It was great. It may look like nothing special, but the regulars there really liven up the atmosphere and make it a unique and fun experience. The bartender was super nice and helpful. The food was also great. I wasn't expecting much, so even though I had my bar set low, the food was still exceptional and reasonably priced. I split the chicken enchiladas with my boyfriend, and we had leftovers because the full one was literally a whole plate of them. This is a hidden gem in Lakewood for sure."}
{"text":"It is unfortunate that the Lakewood Village Tavern is located next door to Grafton Street Pub. Comparing the two really shows off the Village's flaws. Grafton Street Pub is a lot hipper, laid back, and over all less annoying. The Village Tavern is filled with hambone white hats (seriously, who still wears those?) and hooknasties. It is a little dirty, too. They do serve food, which Grafton Street Pub does not. However, would you really want to eat it? It is a less classy version of the Merry Arts."}
{"text":"Maybe one of the most unassuming bars in Lakewood. As a shock to many, the food is way above average. Great wings and burgers and although people may not realize it, their smoked chicken tacos kick ass and are on a level above other cheap bar tacos in Lakewood. Bartenders always fun and courteous. Drinks, cheap. Usually the go-to karaoke bar in Lakewood."}
{"text":"Ordered two triple decker BLT there was two pieces of bacon on the bottom layer and one tomato with the core left in and a piece of brown lettuce. The fries were burnt it was honestly disgusting they were black like they had been in the fryer all day two days even. Just for reference in the photo the fries are not seasoned they are just charred"}
{"text":"So I live very close to this bar, and from the outside, I have always been harsh judge of it. It looks dingy and there are always people spilling into the street, smoking whether it be a Saturday night or a Tuesday evening. However, I was encouraged to try this place when a friend had a going away party here. I went in with a closed mind, but was pleasantly surprised. The place was much bigger than I anticipated, with the front bar area as well as a large back area. There is a stage where they do karaoke. I'm not sure what nights they have it, but it was a Saturday when I saw it there, which is rare. I can't speak for all of their prices as I only had a couple Bud Lights, but those were insanely cheap for a Saturday night at 2.50 a pounder. If you're ever looking for a place to try with a little more of a divey feel, I'd suggest giving this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I had there mini corn dogs I must admit they are smashable and tatter tots come on kids you can't tell me you don't Like those. Nice place to grab a bite to eat and watch the game."}
{"text":"A few good options for greasy food, but not my favorite dive bar in Lakewood. I got three 20 oz drafts and a decent amount of food for $20. The deep fried cheese and mac bites were actually delicious and I can see myself stopping by for a late night snack after a few drinks, but I don't think I'll end up there too often."}
{"text":"Last bar standing!  One of the older bars in Lakewood with the original woodwork and bar. Two sides to this place - so it's fairly large.  Yes, it is kind of divey and dark - but it is a good feel all the same.  If they never change anything ( but keep it clean!) it will be an attraction in  a historic way.   Everybody seemed to enjoy their food.  Excellent wings, tater tots, hamburgers cooked to order, specials on the board.   Try the soups. Great happy hour and not too expensive otherwise.  Fairly good taps although some were out.    We had good service at the bar and table top."}
{"text":"LVT is the best bar in Lakewood. Or maybe it seems that way because I am always drunk in there. Steak dinner for $7. The wings are pretty good. I think it is a good place to go. Madison bars are always the right choice. This place still kind of sucks, but the whole world kind of sucks."}
{"text":"I can't be the only one whose noticed this, but sometime within the last 2-3 months Lakewood Village Tavern began reeking of straight sewage.  I used to love coming here with friends.  They have tasty bar food and good service.  Sadly, the employees have gotten so used to the smell they don't smell it anymore."}
