{"text":"Cold cut with sweet please. Thats what I get when Im there. This place has been around since.....forever. They have the best meatloaf sandwich on the plant. Any deli meat you can think of they have and the red pizza is highly addictive. I cant believe i am the first to review this place. The line at lunch time is usually 10 deep( it goes really fast) ."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches ever - Their Italian sub with sweet peppers is my favorite. The way the sweet peppers taste with the fresh provolone is unreal. Even living two hours away now, this is the first place I go when I'm near the area. You will never find another."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh imported foods from Italy as well as a handful of Mediterranean favorites.  I frequent Ferrara's for their excellent feta cheese as well as their freshly grated pecorino romano cheese.  Their excellent selection of cold cuts and cheeses makes this an excellent stop for a neighborhood deli.  Their fresh selection is hard to pass up and their customer service is efficient.  With mostly family working in this deli, you'll feel like you're right at home while you shop."}
{"text":"Delicious subs made with hot or sweet peppers. Great deli and fresh Italian bread is the best! Still in the dark ages though, can't use your Debit or credit card, check or cash only..."}
{"text":"Old school to the max.  Great, great GREAT sandwiches! I am a sucker for a good turkey sub. Are you listening? Better than DiBellas. And this is no chain. I have been missing places like this! It's like being on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx.  Friendly guys who call you \"dear.\" They are sweet in a (mostly) non- creepy way.  Cash only -- but there is an ATM on the premises."}
{"text":"Has a good assortment of specialty imported Italian foods. It smells like an Italian store when you walk in, which is always a good sign. I like being able to get fresh Italian deli meats and cheeses, and also fresh Italian bread."}
{"text":"Yum!! The sandwiches from here are so good! I always go for the Italian and did hot peppers, but you can basically have them build whatever sandwich you'd like. They also have tons of c other deli stuff, olive oils and etc  They have an entire half aisle of different jarred hot peppers and sandwich spreads which is right up my alley. I almost never leave without grabbing a new one to try. They also have slices of their amazing Sicilian pizza, both red and white.  Don't ignore the goodies by the cash register either. They always have pizza and pizza bagels, but today I noticed banana bread slices. Omg so good! I'm so mad I only grabbed one piece!  Still don't accept credit or debit cards, but there is an ATM there if you need it!"}
{"text":"The minute you walk in your senses will be assaulted in the most beautiful way.  This is the pure aroma of all things Italian.  Full-service market with a really nice selection of pasta, sauces, oils, vinegars, a deli that serves up meats, cheeses, fresh pizza dough, and sandwiches, and more 5L of Carlo Rossi that you can shake a stick at.  I picked up some freshly shredded mozzarella, fresh pizza dough, and sliced pepperoni.  I watched a guy in the back of the store make square sheet after square sheet of pizza dough.  At the checkout I noticed individually wrapped pieces of what looked like focaccia but it turns out they are slices of their Sicilian pizza.  It is mostly sauce on crust with a teeny tiny sprinkling of Parmesan.  As I was driving I unwrapped the slice, took a few bites, and promptly did a u-turn and went back to the store for a few more slices and a quart-size container of their pizza sauce.  DAYUM, Gina.  That stuff is good!  CASH OR CHECK ONLY.  The owner is so nice and you will see him sitting in the front of the store, slicing vegetables."}
{"text":"SOOOO happy we found Ferrara's! Many thanks to Cleveland Yelpers ;) This place was right down the street from where we were staying in Lyndhurst.  First, the outside of the building and the sign look a bit worn. DO NOT let that deter you. Get yourself inside this place, and order an Italian sub with peppers (sweet or hot, take your pick). Order some deli delights to take home. Then wander around and pick out a drink and some other imported grocery items to add to your stash.  The Italian subs we ordered were the bomb. Excellent quality meats and cheese, great olive oil, the marinated peppers were awesome, and the fresh baked bread.... the bread alone is worth the trip, I swear.   I am originally from Philly, but I've been living in Texas for almost 25 years, and I MISS hoagies, meatball sandwiches and cheese steaks SO much. But going to Ferrara's was like going home again.   A couple of tips - this is really a traditional neighborhood grocery with a deli counter, so it's not a sit down place. There are a couple of tables outdoors, but only a couple, so be prepared to take your food home or to the park if you go during a busy time.Also, they only take cash, so come prepared. Last, get lots of napkins. That great olive oil marinated peppers coat the bread, so it can get a little messy near the end, but it's worth EVERY LAST MESSY BITE! GO to Ferraro's. You'll never regret it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sub sandwiches. Tip get it dipped and go for either sweet or hot peppers. Great choices in meat and cheese at the counter."}
{"text":"The only thing I have tried here so far is the pizza and its the best pizza that I have had since I moved to Ohio."}
{"text":"There are simply not enough stars for this place.   I've only purchased sandwiches here from the deli. THIS is the place to get the freshest, biggest, tastiest sub sandwich in the area.    You walk in, and the small of the deli assaults your senses in a very good way. You are completely aware that the place sells fresh deli. OMG, yes.  Walk to the right hand wall for fresh sandwiches. The guys behind the counter are awesome, friendly, helpful, and funny. I LOVE these guys.  If you are female, they will call you sweetheart. They can call me sweetheart anytime. :)  There is a menu on the back wall of sandwich options, but of course, they can make anything you want - it's a deli. I've never had a need to deviate from the menu options.   The meatball or the meatloaf subs are incredible. You will not move for another day. They are huge, but typically go fast.  The hot Italian beef sandwich is also huge. This is a good sandwich to split if you are so inclined.   The Italian subs are amazing. (There are 2 options, and for the life of me I cannot recall the \"upgraded\" version's name.)  All subs can come with hot or sweet peppers. Do not skip this part. I love both, and mix it up depending on my mood.   Most subs are around $6. They are huge. The sub buns are incredible.  Perfectly crisp, crunchy, chewy.  Grab a soda from the other back wall, and you should be good to go!  CASH ONLY. (My coworkers always end up owing me money when we come here.)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on the urging of other yelpers. It's okay, just an Italian food shop with a small deli. The Italian sandwiches were pre-made and the guy did not ask if I wanted lettuce/tomato etc, I had to ask him, so he had to un-wrap them to add. Sandwiches were just alright. I'm from philly, I eat Italian sandwiches, these were eh. Bread was hard. They do have an amazing selection of pastas and other Italian foods in the shop though."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place many times and never thought to stop in.   I had a taste for a good Italian sandwich, so I stopped in on a late Saturday morning to pick up sandwiches for lunch.   The staff was super-friendly.   I ordered to Italian subs, one with hot peppers and one without.  Each sandwich was just a little bit over $4, what a deal.   I also ordered antipasto salad and pasta salad as side dishes to accompany the sandwiches.    I arrived home and my husband and I proceeded to dig in.   The sandwiches included a fresh, hard italian roll with plenty of italian meat, provolone cheese and a nice mix of hot peppers dressed in an italian dressing.  The salads were also fresh and tasty.   The only downside is that they don't take debit/credit cards, so its  good thing that I did have cash.   I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Italian sub in Cleveland.  Their Italian Beef sandwich is on par or maybe even better than any that I've had while living in Chicago.  The also have great bread, decent wine selection, and a huge variety of spices and oils for cooking.  Highly recommend going to Ferrara's the next time you're in the mood for Italian.  You'll feel right at home.  Update - they recently added a dining area on the East end of the store.  Now you can sit comfortably and enjoy your meal.  A bonus is that you get to take in the smell of all of the spices and bread baking."}
{"text":"I've been to this spot on two separate occasions as a quick grab for lunch. I've ordered subs both times my choice of three meets a cheese and what ever toppings i want. they have these sweet roasted red peppers omg there is nothing out there like the kind they have. two young guys were very happy and prompt on making my sub and let me tell you they do not skimp on the portion sizes. I go to Alecies in willowick as its by my home as they have a wider variety of meats and cheeses. Either way i get a great sub and im happy"}
{"text":"Great deli and Italian market. Friendly people, good food ready to eat or take home for your gourmet dinner!    Wide selection of imported cheeses, by the slice or whole. Walking in the door you are assailed by aromas that make you hungry RIGHT NOW!"}
{"text":"Ferrara's is a great neighborhood deli & grocery - for the 6 years I lived in Mayfield Heights, it was our \"go to\" place for fresh bread and pizza dough (so we could make fried dough for dinner, with powdered sugar, natch!).  My brother and I would take our tips from our paper route and buy snacks - I would get Torrone nougat candies and he'd get spicy pepperoni or a jar of hot giardinieri (he was a youth of unique tastes).  The ladies who worked here all knew my stepdad's family - and we could get pizza slices without cheese for him.  It was great to visit here again in August 2011 - my mom and I stopped in on our way to lunch and picked up many tasty vegan friendly items: imported pasta, fresh bread, cute Italian-themed baby bibs and onesies, Euclid Beach popcorn balls (yum!).  I enjoyed looking at the handwritten labels with the same misspelling repeated (see photos) - it's very homespun and has character that you just can't get anywhere else.  On my way out of Cleveland, I stopped by to see if the cashier who was a friend of my stepdad (RIP) was working - she was amazed to hear that I was going back to California by motorcycle.  She wasn't there but all the guys working in the deli and at the cash register - and all the customers - dutifully came out to examine my motorcycle, wish me well and then all turned around and went back in the store.  That's neighborhood love for ya!  If you like Italian food - go here!  You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I started going there about 2 months ago when our office moved from Chagrin Blvd to Landerhaven. One of my coworkers was always raving about this place so I decided to give them a shot. In all seriousness, I've been going there for lunch EVERY day I'm in the office since then because the sandwiches are that good. They must put something in the bread because I'm hooked! Everything is top quality and I'm told that they make the bread for the subs every day. I've suggest getting the Italian Sub w/sweet peppers (and have them dip the top piece of bread in the hot oil).   **Spoiler alert . . . Once you eat one of their subs, you'll never be able to eat at Subway again!"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian subs I have ever had, the hot peppers were amazing and had a good kick, next time I go I am getting the meat loaf sandwich, it looked good."}
{"text":"Cheap. Fast. Delicious. Coworkers took me here for lunch after my first week in town. Had an Italian sandwich sans peppers for under $5.   ***cash only***"}
{"text":"Good price and authentic. Great Italian Beef"}
{"text":"Best Italian deli sandwich I've ever eaten. At $4.50 a pop, it's also the best value in town. All sandwiches I eat get measured up to the Ferrara's standard... and most fail miserably. If I ever come across a sandwich that displaces Ferrara's, it will truly be a memorable day."}
{"text":"This place is ol school legit Italian. You can't get a sandwich for $6.50 anywhere but here. People who work here are great food is insane. It's alllll good."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. My wife and I got subs for lunch. For the price, it was awesome. We'll be returning this summer."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a sandwich for lunch. Keep in mind, there is no place to sit and they only take cash. But it is absolutely worth a stop."}
{"text":"this is as Italian Market as it gets. and its literally half price for what you are gonna get charged by any place in little Italy. Now if you have never been deprived of a good italian market, you may not appreciate this place. But if you have been hunting and hunting for any italian market/deli - well you just found a GREAT one!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Ferrara's for years and since moving away from the area I make a point to stop there when I return on vacation. It's a great place to grab some quick lunch to-go or to get groceries for that big Sunday dinner. They have a great selection of items, I love to just browse the aisles.  Their pizza and subs are phenomenal! They use good quality ingredients and you can taste the love that goes into everything they prepare. The staff are so kind and genuine, they'll make you feel like 'family' whether you're visiting for the first time, or if you're a regular. Love Ferrara's!!"}
{"text":"The only place in the area to go for REAL Italian imports. There are plenty of Italian delis claiming to be real...nah. Check the shelves, those places are full of \"Made in USA.\"   You scan the shelves of Ferrara's, and you'll see things you've never seen before. Gassosas and chinottos, plenty of anise-flavored everything, all proudly made in Italy.   I've never grabbed something from the deli, but it's on the list. I've noticed that they have real Parmiggiano Reggiano cheese, and it certainly isn't cheap, but if you're a cheese freak, you owe yourself the experience.  The front counter has an assortment of candy. I'd recommend anything with sesame seeds, trust me on this, as well as a small selection of common American cigarettes, and an assortment of what are Italian-style cigars. They're USA-made, but have you ever seen an anise-flavored cigar before? (They're decent, too; these aren't Swishers.)  The employees are super friendly, especially the older man and woman whom I assume are the owners.  My only complaint is that the store has extremely weird hours. At this point, I call ahead before stopping in.  Overall, the store reminds me of a down-home general store like I grew up with in rural southern Ohio, but with a real Italian twist.  To top it off, every time I get home after visiting Ferrara's, I find an adorable little Italian candy in an ornate box in my bag. It's like yogurt-covered wafer with a lemon center. Yum."}
{"text":"If you need some Italian food,  come down here.  This store also has religious items like Holy Mary statues, Rosaries, and other items of that nature.  I have never been disappointed at this store.  I really suggest this this store!"}
{"text":"Been enjoying Ferrara's food for about 15 years now,  I remember going there as a kid before I could even see into the deli cases.  Italian Sub with Hot Peppers is always fantastic, along with their Sausage or Meatball sandwiches (they'll even make a half Meatball/ half Sausage sandwich if you ask!).  And my personal favorite bread of anywhere I've had yet.  I'll take a loaf of Ferraras Italian Bread over Distefanos, Corbos,  or Presti's anyday!"}
{"text":"Great Italian subs! First time here. Neat Italian grocery all old school. I ordered the subs and then walked around while they were being made.... I didn't realize they were gonna be fine in like 3 seconds! Amazing! Tasted great. Meat cut a little thicker than most places, good texture. Good bread. Nice taste.  (Edit) I went again and the sandwich was excellent again! Except this time my husband picked up the sandwiches and the first time the guys made them and they asked if we wanted lettuce tomato and onion or whatever and we added peppers. ut this time they were sitting there pre-made. Still delicious! In a different way... but I would have preferred with the other stuff too."}
{"text":"How have I never been here before???  My (100% Italian) husband said he wanted to stop in here while we were running errands and I was blown away.  Their sandwiches were awwwweeesssommme (MUCH better than that Alesci place) and their deli meats were fresh and yummy.  I was even more shocked at their prices of other goods - I feel like we got a great deal on extra virgin olive oil and a few other products that I thought would be way more than chains.  Yay!!"}
