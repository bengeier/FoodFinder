{"text":"I don't leave many reviews but 4.5 stars? Are you kidding me. The server was nice, it's all downhill from there. There was eight of us so we tried a bunch of dishes. One was worse than the next. The shrimp was was cold, wings were passable, large pizza must have come from Walmart, the burgers were over cooked, the brisket terrible and how my friend even had the courage to eat the half chicken is beyond me. Fries were fine. The food dribbled out so some were about done eating as others food came out. Nothing redeemable other than a nice server."}
{"text":"I have been to the Hub several times and I LOVE IT. Food is amazing. The truffle fries are the best I have ever had. The chicken buffalo flat bread is amazing and I can't forget the best salmon I have ever eaten.  The sweet tea and bourbon salmon is a must have. My friend had the brisket and she loved it.  I have also had the ahi tuna and scallops and they were delicious. Everything I have eaten at The Hub has been outstanding. They also have a great beer selection. I will definitely go back soon"}
{"text":"Previous Yelp reviews did not lead us astray. Visited this gem of a place and were happy we did. Food was very good, especially the Buffalo Chicken Flatbread. Nice beer and wine selection. We were lucky to have Cindy wait on us and she was awesome. Will return without question next time I fly out of Charlotte."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. We went there for a quick bite before flying out of NC... The actual restaurant/bar is inside the Holiday Inn; no signs to the restaurant which made it a little tricky to find. Food is good. The fish (tilapia) tacos are simply prepared but quite filling. Their personal pizzas are good - thick crust and a generous portion of toppings - make for a decent meal. Full bar and quick service. Considering that all other options in the neighborhood are fast food or takeout places, this was the best dining choice available right outside the airport..."}
{"text":"I've never really been a fan of hotel restaurants. Just because I stay in hotels through out my whole career. Long enough to know that in hotel restaurants aren't really anything to rave about.  The hub is actually a different story. It's actually pretty good. Not even joking here... I would probably eat here again if given the chance.   Two things I ordered was the truffle fries with pork belly and sweet and spicy wings. The fries were really good, the pork belly gave it some awesome flavor and the truffles gave it that yummy earthy tone. Then the sweet chili wings for the win. Oh yea...  The service was really good as well. My server was very attentive and I felt as if all the servers worked together as one. My beer came frosty cold and my water was refreshed when one of the servers saw it empty.  Thank you \"The Hub\" for being awesome.  Life is great, it's time to enjoy it one yelptastic day at a time. Thanks for reading my review, I hope this helps."}
{"text":"We only had time for a quick meal before I needed to get to the airport for a flight. We told our kind and courteous server, Shandrice and she made sure to get us in and out quickly. In addition to the excellent service, our food was hot and delicious. Thank you Hub Bar and Grill and Shandrice for the hospitality."}
{"text":"The food was good, the staff was excellent.  I had the chicken sandwich which was tasty, my daughter had a cheeseburger which was ok and my Dad had a Reuben which he said was ok.  If you're staying in this area it's the only place to eat other than a food truck with Mexican.  The prices are steep.  Doesn't look like a restaurant,  but more of a lobby that happens to serve food and alcohol.  Staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I found this place after being stranded at the Charlotte Airport and arrived at my Courtyard Marriott hotel to find very few options for food after 9pm.  I walked across the street to the Holiday Inn to find this bar/restaurant still open providing refuge to several other stranded travelers. Great selection of draft beers with several local craft beers on draft. The bar menu is what you would expect, I had wings and a side salad which were good. Considering the other options in the area I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here as we were staying close by. It is definitely a sports bar with a menu big on pizza and burgers. Very loud patrons at bar took away from other patrons and manager did nothing to stop his abusive chatter. Waitress Cindy was horrible...took our order and that was last we saw of her. One of us ordered steak and ff and broccoli and never got our fries or water that we asked for. Host was not attentive and overall the restaurant was ran poorly. I want my $90 back... avoid this dining experience and Cindy as a waitress."}
{"text":"Good service ! I have to say quite the menu. And a spectacular beer selection , this is a Holiday Inn ! Draft beer and a burger a good choice . Don't forget the Pecan Pie yum yum"}
{"text":"Over priced, flavorless food. If hasn't been starving all day from flying I would have taken it back or thrown it out. The fish tacos I got just tasted like char grill marks. Poor quality. Next time I'll just buy some chips from the lobby. Don't waste your money, just order Uber eats."}
{"text":"My second time here and still probably the best bar/ good choice anywhere near the CLT airport. It's inside the the Holiday Inn mind you and last time I drove here from another hotel. This e I'm staying here cause it's a dope hotel and pretty good food, and a great bar!    Had the chicken noodle soup, killer. Legit real pieces of rotisserie chicken in a hot broth with great noodles. The mesquite chicken was good but a little Applebee's- esque in terms of how everything came out of a microwaved bag ( or looked/ tasted like it did) but nevertheless better than Bojangles or some other country crap where it's fried or deep fried everything.   Good drink selection and sports on the tv. All I need to get me back home the next morning and through the night. Also the hotel has a snack bar and a very nice lobby. Probable won't stay anywhere else in the area from now on.   Btw, sign up for the rewards program. I did and got 10% of my bill plus a free beer upon checking in. Dope."}
{"text":"Date: 05/02/17 Time: 7:45 PM  On our last night in North Carolina we wanted to do something simple where we didn't have to drive too far, was delicious, and had wine, of course. We chose The Hub because our Front Desk Agent at the Hampton next door told us it was great and they gave us a 10% off coupon to use. I am so glad!  Our waitress was great! She was super friendly and had great suggestions for my Dad's craving for Pinot Noir. The sweet tea was great! Sometimes it can be way too weak or wayyyy too sweet (esp in this part of the country). It was located directly in front of the entrance at the Holiday Inn.   I had the chicken salad sandwich on sour dough bread with housemade sweet potato fries. Let me just say, IT WAS DELICIOUS! The salad was creamy and perfect! Great bread choice for it as well! The fries were awesome, but sweet potato fries usually are. :) Dad got the Grilled chicken on raspberry walnut bread with sweet potato fries and said he really enjoyed it as well!   I definitely recommend stopping in if you are in one of the nearby hotels or just driving by! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Traveling back to Va. from Atlanta, stopped at the La Quinta hotel and looked on Yelp for a place for dinner. Glad we came here, close by, good food and the service was  great. If you are lucky to have Cindy, you are in for a treat.  Don't  miss this place if you are in the area."}
