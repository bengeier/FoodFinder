{"text":"Oh my gosh!! Authentic food for sure.  It may be a hole in the wall however the food is beyond excellent!  Ordered the chilaquilles and the salsa verde was superb!  My husband ordered the torta de carne asana and let me tell you he said that was by far the best torta he has had in his life.  Atmosphere is quaint and comfortable! Make sure you stop by if you are in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a while and it was good at first but they started to take advantage where I ordered posole and once it came I was disgusted to what I saw. Automatically you can tell it was recook/frozen (the fatness floated to the top). I automatically told the server and I ordered a puerco salsa verde but brought out salsa roja. After that I just told her don't bring me anything and I just left. Horrible experience, I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food, now keep in mind I have only eaten their tacos and their posole. I've personally never seen white posole before, polsole blanco, but add some salt and let the magic happen.  But really, I'm there for the tacos and they are amazing.  The key to a good al pastor taco is a little bit of burn/crisp to add some texture to the meat and they have perfected this.  I saw another review that said something about the bathroom, I don't go to establishments like this for trivial things like the toilet, I came there to get tacos, drop off cans, and get my taxes done.   Magical tacos."}
{"text":"This place is pretty much invisible, but I promise you it exists. I also promise you that you want to eat their tacos. The meat is wonderfully crisp and flavorful, and the tacos come with a good sprinkling of cilantro (this is ingredient #1 for me)."}
{"text":"I love this place, it reminds me of home with its fresh made food & if you love pozole de mole verde they serve it here every Thursday & it's a can't miss   Street tacos Every Friday & Saturday till 1am believe for a fair price... Very well run family business, the owner of this place is really passionate in what he does & he's always striving to make this restaurant a better place"}
{"text":"Best PASTOR street tacos! Trompo tacos with pineapple and aguas frescas!  trompo tacos open fridays and saturdays evenings after 7pm"}
{"text":"Food is 5 stars!!  But if you have to wait 15 minutes for menus and 10 for a drinks and 30 for your food!!  Now that sucks. There is only one lady running food taking orders and running register. They should at least have 1 more person taking orders. I hate waiting for my food especially when I'm starving.   However service Is always on point and the lady is super nice every time I come. :)"}
{"text":"Solid legit Mexican restaurant in Phoenix.  We stumbled upon this place accidentally.  When we walked inside, we noticed that the Taqueria was cooking up literal street tacos outside next to the building, and the smell was great.  We probably could have stopped there and been satisfied, but instead we headed inside, where I ordered my usual enchiladas and my husband got his usual encebollada (or whatever equivalent steak is offered on the menu).  Steak was delicious, enchiladas were about average (a little more offerings on the veggie toppings would be helpful).  It looks like the restaurant offers a lot more home-cooked specialties as well, like sopa de pollo, which I remember fondly from Honduras.  I would definitely return to grab some cheap street tacos or some other authentic Mexican dish, but I probably wouldn't order the enchiladas again, just because the Taqueria has so many other tasty-sounding options."}
