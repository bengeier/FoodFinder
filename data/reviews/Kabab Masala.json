{"text":"Thinking 4 stars is perfect, my husband and I eat there....wow, so many jars with spices on display, but our food did not even had a trace of salt! Rice which is so good at Indian places was bla without a hint of a taste. Forget about marsala... Thanks for eggplant's side dish - it was spicy, so, we both used it to have some taste in mouth. Samosas were not bad. The place needs a lot of improvement."}
{"text":"Don't let this place fool you just because it's in the food court of a mall!  The food was OUTSTANDING. Very fresh and flavorful. The service has been excellent each and every time, even if it was only a 2 minute encounter.  I always get the vegetarian option with rice and a side of aloo (potato) something or other. It was reasonably priced and delicious! My only complaint is that they don't have a full service restaurant that I can frequent...hint hint.  Support this place because they are awesome. Awesome food. Awesome workers.  And not a chain/ corporate, which makes them.... awesome."}
{"text":"I had Chicken Curry on Rice with Chickpeas. The taste of Checkpeas was OK, the chicken curry was hotter than the standard level at other Indian places. and it was hot with no taste. I could not tell that I was eating chicken. I could not get the taste of rice either. My mouth was just burning with no sense at all.   The portion is small. For $6 I would expect to get double of that. And the type of plate they chose to serve is hard to understand. It has 3 sections, but the sections are deep and narrow. It is not the right plate for that type of food. I would prefer have one big section, and it wold help me eat the food easier. And the spoon and fork they offer. I am not expecting anything other than plastic, but I expect something that does not have sharp edges and it is strong and has better quality, big enough to help me enjoy my food. You have to take 4-5 spoons of food to fill your mouth once.  I do not think I will give them another chance. I know Saffron Patch. You may have to pay double price for the same food at Saffron Patch, but you will get double size and excellent quality that will make you come back to Saffron.  I am wondering how this place can stay in business. I will not be surprised if they disappear soon."}
