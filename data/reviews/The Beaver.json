{"text":"My friends DJ a 45s night here so I tend to go about once a month.  It is a great little spot on Queen west with a nice decor and good music.  I am not crazy about their bar stools but it is a great little place to have a few drinks with friends and listen to good music.  A few years ago I did go for lunch and I remember enjoying a panini and olive plate."}
{"text":"Bartenders were great and engaging, DJ that night was playing all the right songs and the people adding to the atmosphere were all feeling it. Really enjoyed myself!"}
{"text":"The Beaver is a tiny diner on West Queen West. It has been around as long as I can remember, but was purchased by Lynn formerly of Lee's Palace and Will Munro, of Vazeleen fame w few years back and turned into much more than just a diner.  The food is my fav. The portions aren't over the top. They don't drown everything in mayo and the breakfast isn't greasy. For lunch, it's the tuna melt with avocado, breakfast; the burrito and if you're just popping in for a pint, grab the guacamole. Oh, and the bread is all baked fresh daily.  As far as ambiance goes, it's a traditional diner meets great quaint back patio. The bathrooms are small, but very clean and all the young boys who work there, look like they stepped from an 80s Blue Boy magazine. In fact, Will and Lynn are top tier and choosing hot bagel boys.  At night, it's a bar, with local DJs and one-off dance parties. It packs up really fast and leans toward the arty, gay-boy scene.  Service with a smile, it's one of the joints that people move to the west end for."}
{"text":"I was meeting a friend for brunch at the Drake, but, as per usual, it was packed. We decided to walk down the Gladstone, but passed the Beaver Cafe and thought \"hey, this is new for us, let's eat here\".  When we walked in, we were hit with a wall of heat and grease-smelling smoke. Apparently their ventilation system is non-existent, but nevertheless, we stayed. We arrived around 1:30pm -- the cafe wasn't overly crowded and we were seated right away. The menu is pretty typical, although I noticed a lot of items with tofu. As per usual, I ordered a Diet Coke and, as per usual, it barely had any ice. Seriously, Canada, if you gave me a) copious amounts of ice and b) free refills, I'd love you long time.  I ordered the Avocado and Tomato sandwich, which came with your choice of a side of greens or eggs; that the eggs were a side option was odd to me. My friend ordered the salmon salad, and our food arrived temperature appropriate and pretty quickly. The food was just okay. It was a little on the bland and the average side.   The Beaver Cafe won't blow your socks off, but it definitely is a good choice for a weekend brunch when all else fails."}
{"text":"Love this place.    First time we went was Christmas Eve, (daytime), for a beer.  Really like their Hawaiin style Pale Ale, (Spearhead) so now we drop in for at least one beer every time we're going past on the 501; usually between 5pm-7pm time, about 3 or 4 times a week.  Always great bar staff and cool tunes.  Like to sit in the window.  Friday night we popped in a bit later than normal; about 10.15pm and it was a busier than we're used to but the service was still really friendly and cool.  Window seats all full so we sat up the back.  They clear the tables at the back about 10.30pm to make room for dancing, so we moved back down to the window area; the DJ starts and the music is funky/mellow dancable if that's your thing.  Started going for the beer; now we go for the beer, nice vibe, friendly staff, relaxed patrons, cool spot altogether."}
{"text":"I don't know why I haven't reviewed this place yet.  I keep coming for brunch because I know they'll let me swap in avocado for any of the meat in their breakfasts--always a plus when stopping by after an early morning workout!    The menu is small but everything on it works, and the staff is very friendly.  The patio in the back is lovely and private; it's a perfect place to sit  out on a warm night."}
{"text":"ive never eaten here lol but now that i see all these reviews i just might. i used to go here a lot to get kinda drunk on my one drink maximum and go dancing with friends from the neighbourhood. best nights ever!!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. The service was sub-par and there were quite a few fruit flies hanging out at our table. In addition they didn't have the full set of beers as shown on the menu. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"It's a decent place, but not for brunch. The hipster breakfast is slow, over-pestoed and their coffee isn't too warm. They have an annoying habit to keep the street door open in the middle of the winter. Nonetheless, it's a great place for a drink and dinner."}
{"text":"Great music, get service, great staff, great atmosphere. It can be tight at times, but the attitute of its patrons makes it not at all uncomfortable. If your lookong for a laid back place for easy conversation with a friend or stranger, The Beaver will do it for you."}
{"text":"Live the extra healthy menu options, Club is my favorite sandwich here with lots of avocado!  Always a happy smile when you sit down :) Thanks"}
{"text":"This is as good as bar in Toronto can get. I am one happy customer after experiencing patient, pleasant and accommodating servers on a Friday night.  Amazeballs"}
{"text":"I'm giving the beaver a 3 because I know it doubles as a party joint, and it knows how to do that right. Cooking, on the other hand, is not the beaver's forte. No, maybe it's a clever move on their part not having too elaborate a menu -- their soups/pie/starters are lackluster enough.   I enjoyed the oysters, but oysters generally meet the mark so long as they're of decent quality. The antipasto plate was my favourite pick of the night, and I doubt the beaver cured those meats and aged that cheese.   The soup, veg. pie and veg. pate were ridiculously insipid. We were going crazy with the salt and pepper, tossing it on all our dishes.   One thing I'm always grateful for at the beaver is the lighting and good music -- that, and the company I was with, made the experience tolerable. Hope they change their kitchen staff soon as I like this place otherwise."}
{"text":"We heard about the fantastic french toast here and it's close by so we dropped in for breakfast.    The place is kind of divey but awesome!  We were told to sit anywhere and we went to the back to grab a table.  Our waitress brought us a menu and the french toast wasn't on it!!!  I'm pretty sure it's a brunch only item.  Seeing some of the reviews we decided to stick around to try some other items on the menu.  We ordered the breakfast burrito and the BLT so we were going to split our meals to try each item.  The BLT was boring...very standard BLT with minimal B, L and T.  The breakfast burrito was solid but it was mostly the chili or salsa as the eggs were extremely weird...extremely weird.  I confirmed this when I tried my brothers eggs and they had a weird texture and absolutely no flavour.  It was very strange and definitely not good.  The service was weak as well.  We were there for an hour and a half.  They did not check on us to see if we wanted a refill on water or another coffee...or anything else at all.  They were there for the menu and water, our order, bringing our food and we flagged them down for the bill.  We still left a good tip though but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Oh The Beaver... The perfect place for a casual dinner, drink or dance party.   I've never been disapointed by the food (I'm so sad to see fellow reviewers disagree) and the bartenders know how to make a good Amaretto Sour. I'll agree that their menu is not so out-of-the-ordinary BUT, it is always generous, fresh and typically served by hotties.  This venue was Will Munro's brainchild and the crowd is queer friendly and knows how to party. The space is a tad on the small side but that just adds to the cozy atmosphere and thank goodness for the back patio where you can get a breath of fresh air when the party heats up."}
{"text":"I will probably never come here again. I have never been treated so poorly by a bartender in my life. I asked if I could pay debit, he answered me sarcastically and looked at me like I was stupid (they do offer debit by the way, why the snarky reply?). I asked for a Sex on the Beach, he looked at me like I was stupid and replied \"I don't even know what that is.\" I told him how to mix it, and he did it wrong. I honestly don't know what was wrong with him, but he shouldn't be serving people. I'm not going to pay $6.00 to be treated rudely and not even receive what I ordered."}
{"text":"Brunch menu is small but fairly diverse.  There seems to be something for everyone depending on your mood ranging from sweet chocolate almond baked french toast to a breakfast burrito.  The food is pretty tasty.  I had the homemade sausage and was overwhelmed by the sage in the dish.  I was not blown away by either brunch experience I have had.  The music is by far the best part and is always fantastic. The place actually seems kind of dingy.  It could definitely benefit from a fresh coat of paint and a good spit shine cleaning.  It is unfortunate because they have a good space, they just need some window dressing.  Service was decent. There is an outdoor patio which is a bonus.    I am sorry to say that I would not leave it to beaver."}
{"text":"Good crowd. Average priced drinks. Decently sized dance floor. The patio out back is sweet with plenty of seats and tables.   The only draw back is that there are only two bathrooms."}
{"text":"The Beaver is turning into a regular stop for me. Great for drinks and to grab a bit on a Friday night when I forgot to eat but went out for drinks anyways. Whoops!   Plenty of vegetarian options. I really enjoyed the burrito when I've ordered it despite a less than stellar review. It's hard to be vegan here, but they've altered a thing or two for friends when they needed it changed.  There is lots of room to sit and music is always stellar. The barkeeps are awesome and friendly. Occasionally the service is slow but it's still really clear the staff are working hard and fast - there are just too many patrons.  It can be a little annoying when I get there early, eat a table and within moments I'm surrounded by people as the bar gets busy but this is a function of bars like this. Now that I know what I'm getting myself into, I can adapt accordingly. It can be loud at times (again, starts off kind of quiet early in the evening but gets loud later) but the music is normally so good that I don't mind."}
{"text":"Stopped into the Beaver for a little bite around lunchtime today. Was a bit sad that i missed their breakfast menu, but what can ya do?! I like to sleep in on my day off :)  The place was pretty quiet, but hey, it's a Monday and the weather was on and off rainy, so i'm sure they aren't getting as much walk-by traffic as they usually would.  I just grabbed a Maple Butter Tart, while my friend got a latte, a gluten-free brownie and a chocolate croissant. The butter tart was ok. Personally i like butter tarts that are ooey-gooey-er. I tried the brownie and the chocolate croissant as well. The brownie was REALLY moist and chocolatey. Really good for gluten-free, but not my favourite brownie. But the croissant..... oh the croissant! was SO good. Baked fresh every day and you can taste the freshness right there in your mouth! Soft and buttery and deeeeeeeeelish.  The decor was great and we got a spot at the front counter so we could people watch on Queen St. I'd like to come here at night to see how the place transforms with a DJ. Interesting..."}
{"text":"I like this place. It had a very positive vibe and is completely queer (and straight) friendly. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I enjoyed my cold brew, and my ginger cookie was decent enough.   The only downside was that there were some WIFI issues that day or something because neither my friend nor I could connect in order to complete our work.   I will definitely go again for the friendly service and welcoming atmosphere!"}
{"text":"You can have a great time at the Beaver whether it's 10am on a weekend or 10pm any day! Great weekend brunch and everyday lunch, dinner and snacks.  I love their beet salad and sweet potato burrito! Seating area at the back can be a little dark... has a bit of an old  industrial feel to it. They have a quiet secluded back patio, but there's no view. Fast and friendly service. Has everything a cafe, bar, restaurant would have."}
{"text":"The Beaver is the best spot on this stretch of Queen Street! I have been going here for years, and it is consistently a winner. Now that it's the sunny season, I highly recommend hitting their patio for a chill post work (or post spin class) beverage. The Beaver has all sorts of fun events--the last time I visited there was a comedy show on the patio, and the time before there was superhero trivia. They also have a recurring karaoke event that can get pretty wild! Drinks are reasonably priced and more importantly, the bartenders are kind and accommodating of my penchant for basic vodka sodas and white wine."}
{"text":"Chocolate, almonds, fruit, and maple syrup?  Yes please!!    I hit up the Beaver for brunch this past weekend after reading many positive reviews.  It's a little difficult to see if you don't know what you're looking for, because the sign is just a \"B\", but we found it and made our way in.  I don't know if it's a \"look\" they're going for, but the interior seemed kind of run down in my opinion.  Not terrible, but not great either.  Shabby chic perhaps?  They weren't too busy so we had our choice of tables and selected one on the back raised portion of the restaurant.  We asked for orange juice, and were informed that it was currently being squeezed - big plus in their favour to have juice THAT fresh.  If most places get away with charging $3+ for theirs, I can't complain about having fresh squeezed for $5.    The menu doesn't have a whole lot of options, and I actually did the unthinkable - I ordered the same thing as my DC.  This is something that I rarely allow to happen, usually opting to change my order rather than get the same meal.  In this case, though, it really was the best choice with no close second: we had the French toast.    When it arrived shortly after, we were presented with plates of thick bread swimming in maple syrup, each with a dollop of whipped cream.  It's not a dish for someone counting calories...or sugar intake.  I would say that I suffered a serious sugar high shortly after the meal but really it was probably my SO that suffered.  The poor guy had to put up with his girlfriend's giddy giggling for a solid hour.  In fact, just the phrase \"girlfriend's giddy giggling\" probably would have been enough to reduce me to giggles.    But back to the French toast.  I still don't know what the bread was.  I asked the server on our way out, and she said it was croissant but that did not seem right at all.  It was far too dense to be a croissant, unless they make terrible croissants.  The meal was tasty despite the sugar overload, but I did feel like it was heavier than necessary.    All in all, friendly service and tasty but very dense and heavy French toast.  I might try it again for a lunch service, but I'll try another place next time I want brunch."}
{"text":"The nighttime ambiance really prevents this place from being sequestered into cheesy diner status. The music is muted and cool while the atmosphere is friendly and relaxed. Patrons can mull over the previous days events over cocktails. Be sure to come before midnight if you're feeling peck-ish since the kitchen closes rather early and supplies often run low towards the end of the night. Thankfully, we were able to get the last of the humous, which was delicious, but the pita crisps were terrible--very dry and they were pretty stingy with the portions. Overall, though, it was rather pleasant."}
{"text":"I loved the space - I felt right at home upon entering - and our server was terrific but the food fell short for me. The two lunch specials on offer were what I chose and the mac and cheese was bland and the potato pesto soup was just okay.  My dining companion's lunch looked quite enticing, however, which makes me think I just ordered poorly."}
{"text":"Horrible angry service staff. A place where fun goes to die. Bugs everywhere and gross food."}
{"text":"I like this place as a casual place to grab a low key drink or two. Coming during the evening it's usually pretty sparsely filled and makes for an unassuming stop to wet the whistle.  I've never eaten the food, so will leave that to other people to review. The beer selection isn't exactly impressive, but still has some craft options including Amsterdam and Spearhead and from what I remember the prices were reasonable.   There is a small patio out back as well. The seating is a bit awkward as its really more communal vibed bench seating, but it's outdoor and gets daytime sun so who's to complain. I've come here a few times when in the area, but never made it a \"destination\", so a 3 star review feels right."}
{"text":"The food was good here, but the ambiance is a little loud.  Very good beer selection.  The chef is at the front of the house, but he was a little bit of a grump--don't know why."}
{"text":"I'm very tempted to rate The Beaver ***** for the simple reason that they have the very best french toast I have ever put in my body.  Yes, you read that right:  EVER.  (Ya.  All caps.  Suck it, interweb etiquette police)  And if I permit myself an opportunity to brag (\"go ahead, Patrick, you've earned it\"), I make pretty fantastic french toast, like, write home to mom fantastic.  The Beaver kicks me in the teeth and makes me beg for more, then sends pictures to your mom.  So what's the deal?    Baked chocolate almond french toast, swimming in about a cm of real maple syrup, topped with fluffy-cool whipped cream, and scattered with big juicy berries, grapes (both globe and red), and half a dozen slices of ripe banana.  $10.  The toast itself is fluffy, eggy, spongy, caramelized, chocolatey, heavenly.  Order it.  (Rest of the party ate food.  I paid it little heed.  Brekkie burrito, tofu scramble burrito, two Beaver brekkies... I heard the phrase \"these eggs are amazing!\" uttered twice in reference to their steamed scramble...  lattes were excellent, cappuccino serviceable, french press rather delicious, and a cup of fresh squeezed orange juice that elicited a smile and audible sigh of contentment.)  But seriously:  The French Toast."}
{"text":"The Beaver is a good place to get a French Stick, or a fresh baked good.. It always smells pretty appealing in there... Ron Burgundy-esque. I really like the Blonde Bartender with the \"W\" Haircut, he is friendly, fast, and efficient. Even when it is slammed this guy runs the whole bar no problem, with a smile...there is a lack of Vegan Options but the Hummus is good...ask for extra bread... On another note, The beer selection is Vast,Very Cold and very reasonably priced. The Music at night is a great selection, but uneven so it can go from reasonable party level sound to ear blasting in seconds... Who cares though... It is a block from my house and the place is consistent.  Hint: There is this amazing private patio in the back, it was raining when I was there, but we still sat out there due to the coolness..."}
{"text":"I found this place while looking on google for karaoke on a Sunday night, what an awesome find. Atmosphere was so welcoming, the most friendly patrons and karaoke staff. There were two bartenders working one being a woman and one a man. The man approached me asking what id like to drink I asked him if he could make me something fruity. He told me that he has no idea what thats supposed to mean and walked away from me ignoring me for 20 minutes. The woman bartender noticed me waiting and served me in a friendly timely manner. This place is so fun! its just a shame they have that rude man working behind the bar."}
{"text":"Great place for a group of friends to hang out! Loved the Beaver Nachos with both cheddar and goat cheese mmmm. Bottles of beer were reasonably priced, and Netflix Pub night was TOO MUCH FUN!! great atmosphere and a lot of great peeps!"}
{"text":"Was recommended to us by a girl working at a vintage store down the road. Told her we were looking for something authentic to the queen street area since we had just gotten into town a few weeks prior and hadn't had a chance to explore. It's a little tricky to find (just marked by a large \"B\" light outside)...but once we found it we were pleased. Great service and a cozy place to sit for a couple of hours on a rainy saturday afternoon. Pesto panini was solid and the salmon on black bread was good but a little salty with all the capers. Chocolate cupcake was a tad bit dry but the icing was amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm a Starbucks snob and I thought the coffee here was excellent!  It was very strong but not bitter at all.  The french toast was excellent.  I also HAD to try to eggs with that famous maple sausage.  Best sausage I ever had.  Service - very friendly laid-back waitress."}
{"text":"After waiting 45 minutes at The Drake we gave up and went to The Beaver for brunch. What a difference! Whereas The Drake had a snooty vibe and a sense of self importance, the Beaver was immediately welcoming and  Eric was a wonderful waiter, attentive and quick to get us drinks. The food was great and the iced coffee was done well. The only quibble was that the picnic table on the patio was a bit uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Divey...friendlyish staff...Kinda boring?  Drag show is laughable."}
{"text":"The beaver looks good but they manage to screw up most things the Wellington SPA has to be the worst in the city. The menu is written so faint you cannot read it without a Iphone flashlight the food is dismal . I had the Indian taco just because I didn't know Indians ate tacos but apparently they do on sweet bagels avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"Nice little cozy hideaway with great beer/coffee and awesome food. Vegan friendly no less ;)"}
{"text":"This is a little place a few doors east of The Drake.Really great atmosphere that doesn't feel like many Queen West places.staff are  incredibly friendly and their menu is small but all really well done. Lots of vegetarian options as well as a wide range of craft beer. Had a taste of cherry cider today, creative but definitely not my thing. As a beet lover their salad is wonderful. Smaller place so it feels very intimate. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Huh...no brunch/breakfast reviews. Odd. Unlike the other reviews, I've actually only been here in the AM although the other reviewers are making me consider coming later in the evening.  I've been here three times for breakfast/brunch and left pretty happy each time. In ascending order of deliciousness, I've had the salmon salad, breakfast sausage, and then french toast (the last of which I suggest to anyone). The sausage was more sweet than spicy (maple syrup?).  I've been in before noon each time and it is always quieter than I expect. I suppose that the best way to put it would be to say that it seems like a nice place to have a leisurely breakfast and catch up on those New Yorkers that have been piling up.  The staff have always been pleasant and prompt and servings are generous relative to the more popular/trendy brunch/breakfast places. In addition, seating is easier and plates are $4-$5 cheaper.  Not a world beater but more than \"ok.\" I would say \"A-OK\" which is apparently what three stars means in what I read above. A nice place to chill when you are not intentionally showing people how you know the latest trendy place for breakfast.  p.s. Similar to at least one other reviewer, I dig the dark wood interior.  NOTE: there seems to be a duplicate review for \"The Beaver Cafe.\""}
{"text":"I went here late at night (11pm on a Friday night) for some drinks with friends. The bar staff are okay to deal with. However, I found the crowd to be very rude. My friend was dancing to the music and some people yelled at her for dancing. they told her she had to listen to the music and bob her head..not dance.  seriously?   Maybe eating here would be better .. which I'll have to try for another time."}
{"text":"Loved hanging out at this bar with great food, great cocktails, sweet big cookies, and a couple awesome local beers on my recent trip to Toronto. It's a dark, low-key dive bar that just happens to make an excellent club sandwich which is perfect on their sunny back patio with a grapefruit cocktail. The staff were fun to hang out with too, I loved cracking jokes with these ladies and the endearing way they repeatedly tried to convince me to not bother working. I wish I could have been there for one of their truly wonderful-sounding theme karaoke nights. Top of the list when next I'm back!"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch on Sunday. Their brunch hit the spot for that particular chilly drizzling Sunday morning while my boyfriend and I shared the breakfast burrito and the french toast special. It was good. I was secretly hoping they had more selection.  The service is what it is. No complaint from me though."}
{"text":"Daytime review:   Two people recommended it so we were excited to come, but I think I was expecting a litttttle more from The Beaver then what it turned out to be. Our fault for coming by so early in the evening, I guess.  At Saturday around 8pm there were only 3 tables full for dinner. It was quiet and pretty empty. The menu is more suited for a quick lunch bite (burgers, tacos etc...), then any fulfilling dinner, but it was tasty and quick. The burger was very good, and the gin cocktail grapefruit fancy pants drink was fine. Spent about $22 USD.   I guess we came too early to experience the gay scene. Oh, well."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place at all. Service was terrible. The waitress basically tried to rush us so she could close us out and leave. Pretty lame.   The food there is no better. Heated olives? WTF? Is that meant to bring out the non-existent flavour in these apparent \"spiced\" olives? They were bad kalamatas at best. The antipasto platter is pretty bad too. More of those olives plus various flavourless cheeses. One of the cheeses was like ricotta but firmer and with no taste. Why is that on the platter on its own? The seating in the back is a bit awkward and doesn't help.  Maybe this place is fun for locals but not worth going out of your way for (like an only cafe for example)"}
{"text":"Cool little Dive bar. They serve food here (didn't have any,  but I know they serve it)  It's small, but has a good vibe. The night I was there they pulled the tables away to make room for dancing which always helps.  The bartenders were cool. They have a lot of beer options which are listed in writing (chalkboard ) on their wall. The staff is quick to help you decide which beer you should get.  They accept cash or credit thankfully as I never have cash or because I always forget to convert my USD to CAD.  The music was good, the beer was good, and the people were great. I like it her"}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper tonight at The Beaver.  It's been in our 'hood for ten years but we've never had supper there.  Gord ordered Baked Mac & Cheese.  He said it was delicious and he would get it again.  I ordered the Beaver Club (minus the greens).  The sandwich was delicious.  It was filling so I didn't eat much of the salad.  I'd get it again.  Danielle was our server.  She was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Stumbled into The Beaver, supremely late one night because of no cover and no line-up and also because Roncy was absolutely dead.  Was jam packed. They have a pretty ok beer selection. All I remember is that the Wellington is a light, raspberry flavored beer.   Our bartender was craptastically bad. He shrugged in response to all three of my questions, prepared drinks very sloppily, splashing things around. I get it, you're a starving hipster with a bad attitude. But then you shouldn't be making a living in the service industry.  Anyways, the girl who was serving the other section had her wits about her and made up a bit for the douchiness of our bartender.  The drinks were good, the company was good, the back patio was pretty hopping as was the tiny dance floor. Would've rated higher had the bartender been more civil."}
{"text":"Great drinks and chill music. Visited on a Friday night and it was pretty quiet 8-9:30pm. The crowds starts flooding in after 10pm and they start charging cover to get in.  If you go there early around 8pm, there are tables available - tables gets taken away to make way for the crowds later, but they won't force you out the table if you are still sitting and drinking. Our group pretty much had a \"private\" section with a table when the crowds started accumulating, which was kinda cool. We eventually felt bad taking up so much space when it got really crowded and left ~11pm."}
{"text":"Extra points for serving late into the evening.   No points though for being sort of lackluster and not having food options that were delicious.  I think Evelyn W had a better time mauling a burrito than I did eating usually warm olives, but the cast of characters was enough to keep me entertained.   Evelyn promised me drag queens and there was nary a queen in sight, but on St. Pat's day there was a wealth of funny hats and green hair, so that sort of made up for it."}
{"text":"First chilly weekend of the season calls for a nice comforting brunch and The Beaver definitely delivered! A friend and I wandered in looking for some good eats and we were happy to see they were still serving brunch at 3 in the afternoon. The menu is modest but it all looks pretty tasty. I would've ordered the shakshuka (a baked egg in tomato ragu and goat cheese) but their oven wasn't working so I ordered the regular breakfast instead which consisted of eggs, your choice of bacon or ham, salad and toast all for $10. Solid! The bacon and ham are cooked perfectly, you get 4 slices of your choice of rye or French baguette for toast, and the eggs are perfectly \"steamed\" and scrambled. I think she made them in a metal cup with the espresso machine? Totally cool! I've never seen that but it worked very well.   It wasn't a fancy meal but it was done very well for a very reasonable price. I'd love to come back for that shakshuka though!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because I met a pretty cute guy here, but the drag queen that hosted last night's party was atrociously entitled, confrontational, aggressive, and downright nasty - especially for a host of party with a cover charge... Allysin Chaynes: no one wants to see a fat bearded lady doing poppers on stage, can I suggest you come to Brooklyn and learn some proper drag finesse and learn from professionals?"}
{"text":"Great food, inclusive vibes, wild at night and tame in daytime. The DJs are wonderful as well!"}
{"text":"I really disliked what I ate here. I ordered the BLT and eggs. The BLT tasted like salty microwavable bacon sandwiched between stale toast. That was heaven in comparison with the scrambled eggs. I have never eaten wet sponge before, but I think that describes the scrambled eggs. They were absolutely flavourless, almost as if they used powdered eggs, added powdered milk, and added water, then used a machine to suck out any flavour of goodness of what could have been.  I did not finish this meal and I almost always finish my meal. I cannot remember not finishing a meal because of sheer dislike of my food in my adult life until now. I won't be back."}
{"text":"They are a cafe by day, bar by night. I prefer them for weekday lunch or brunch than anything else. Inside is just way too loud, dingy and tight on space at nights. The music makes it virtually impossible to carry a conversation. Their patio, on the other hand, is very quiet during the day. It has a feel of a small secluded backyard than an actual patio and has absolutely no view (like the Green Room patio).   Their lamb burger is the signature item on the menu. The pulled pork sandwich is alright but might be a tad too vinegary for some. One of my biggest pet-peeves with The Beaver is that they're always missing items on the menu. Whether it's a beer or food, you're almost guaranteed to have pick an alternative because they're simply out of that or this. The one bright point is that they carry a watermelon meat beer (the name escapes me), which can be very refreshing on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"Don't you love it when sandwich boards speak to you? Here I was strolling down Queen in Parkdale in search of a cafe that also had food...then I saw The Beaver's board: \"A cafe that sells yummy food too!\"  I ordered the apple and cheddar quesadillas which was amazing! I was also going to get a premium salad as a starter and the waiter let me know a salad came with my meal (I hate it when no one tells me and I am stuck with tow salads).  I will definitely be going back and like Kat F said their music selection was awesome (Emily Haines, David Bowie, The Stranglers, and Radiohead)."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for drinks, but I've always had a great time at the Beaver. In particular, I remember one night when the bar was filled with drag queens singing \"I Will Survive\" and I think that single moment made my night!  They've always got a great crowd here and decent beers on tap. I've only ever heard good things about the food, which makes me want to revisit for a brunch date.  The exterior is kind of unassuming and it's easy to walk by without realizing what it is. Nights vary from mellow drinking to full-on party, I suggest checking the listings if you're not into the spontaneity."}
{"text":"Cute Bar but I chose not to actually spend any money there.  They have a minimum of 25 on credit, no debit cards at the bar and their ATM charges $6 which is kind of ridiculous.  If that was different I would have stayed longer and probably have spent a whole bunch of money."}

{"text":"I've been here many, many times for drinks and had a great time, and for that reason I'm adding an extra star to my two star review. I went here for lunch yesterday and the food was REALLY underwhelming and I would not recommend it to anyone.   Service was great and so was the music (Air's \"Moon SafarI\"). One of the cooks went to turn the volume up and was promptly YELLED at (no exaggeration) by two elderly gentlemen who didn't want music with their meals. He barely flinched, apologized and left the volume as it was. I would have really been gritting my teeth at the rudeness of the two customers but the cook handled it well.  Now the food. I was really intrigued by the wonderful options on the menu: baked mac & cheese with swiss, cheddar and shaved reggiano, bean and beet burger with dilled cucumber, red union, grainy dijon aioli and German potatoes, lamb and chevre burger, quince and chevre quesadilla. Lots of veggie options.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, but I can't help but think that a burrito is pretty basic food and hard to screw up. I ordered the black bean and sweet potato burrito ($10) with sour cream, avocado and salsa and it was incredibly underwhelming. The burrito was expertly packed/grilled but the flavour was bland. They used short grain white rice and canned black beans (not that I was expecting dried - I mean, no one should have to slave over a pot of soaking beans) but they were watery and poorly rinsed. I like my Mexican rice to be a little \"dirtier\". There was NO spice or flavouring to speak of. The sweet potatoes were boiled and flavourless and the tomatoes...  Oh my word, the tomatoes.  CANNED.  I do not appreciate canned tomatoes EVER, unless in a chili or other soupy type of food where there are a million other competing flavours to suppress it. There is no excuse to use watery canned tomatoes in a burrito. It really ruined the burrito and made everything else inside it rather mushy and 'tinny' tasting. This burrito was a real failure."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of different experiences at The Beaver, and I must say they've all been pretty lovely.   These experiences are extremely varied. They go from wifi-stealing sessions over cookies to dancing with drag queens hard at Karaoke to lunch with colleagues to late night pints and back again. Their food menu is small and simple, but they really take pride in how it's assembled and it shows.   In the summer, they have a rotating boozy slushy drink... and this clearly deserves it's own paragraph on Yelp."}
{"text":"Le soir comme en journée, un endroit authentique. Toujours bon, toujours juste et sympathique."}
