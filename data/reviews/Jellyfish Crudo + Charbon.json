{"text":"My first experience there was when Jellyfish was in its second week. It wasn't packed and we had a small meal with my boyfriend because we had to get to a concert. Since that time we always mentioned to go back there to actually enjoy it in a more relaxed manner. I wish we did not! The restaurant is full, food and service do not impress you at all. For food we ordered the crab bao, cod and charcoal carrots. First the crab came and we thought that it was okay but a bit too fried. Then there were the cod and charcoal carrots. Cod's top was literally burnt. I love Jatoba and their cod melts in your mouth. Compared to that eating at Jellyfish was an awful experience. We asked for bread three times. The first one the server forgot, the second time the bread went to the table behind us and in the third time we were already done with the food. At least the server brought it because after eating the cod and the carrots I was sick and needed something to keep me from getting worser until I got home. After the bread we paid and quickly got home to rest. What an end to the night... Besides enjoying the ambiance wouldn't recommend it at all"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for my birthday with a few friends on December 26. Where do I even begin?! The whole night was a disaster! We ordered and 45 minutes later, still no food. We tell our waitress and instead of apologizing, she bluntly said \"Let me check what time I punched in the orders,\" as if we were lying. She comes back and tells us that we ordered 40 minutes ago. By then, we were ready to leave! The front manager comes and tells us the chicken takes 25 minutes to cook. How do you explain the extra 20 minutes that we've been waiting?! She then tells us we'll each get a free desert as a compensation. It's not that we couldn't afford to pay, but I would expect more professionalism from this type of restaurant. She then offers 25% off each person's bill. I was so hungry and didn't want to go through all the trouble of looking for another restaurant, so I accepted the offer. The bread and butter were cold; it felt like eating cardboard. Everyone's plate was bland. At that point, I just ate out of hunger. When it was time for the bill, the manager says only the birthday girl gets a free desert. We agreed on everyone getting a free desert plus 25% off on the bill. Each time we asked to speak to the manager, she would walk around avoiding our table or tell the waitress to come ask us how we are doing. During the whole night, we basically ate for 10 minutes because we were really hungry, and spent a total of 3 hours waiting for the manager and waitress to serve us. Manager is a liar and unprofessional. The waitress also lacks professionalism when speaking to customers; she was giving us attitude. Never once did the manager nor the waitress apologize. Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT go to this restaurant! Worst dining experience I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Good food that was interesting and innovative. The carrots were a little undercooked and the tuna crudo had too much wasabi. However, our server, Catherine was awesome - very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and fantastic atmosphere! It's a great spot for professionals of all ages going for a bite and drink with coworkers and/or friends after work. It is definitely pricey but the main dishes make it worth. My only complaint is that the appetizer portions are quite small for the price. Other than that, I had great service, great drink and a great time! Even made some friends while I was there!"}
{"text":"A great night. The Manhattan with double smoked bacon was amazing. Yes, bacon! Appetizers were well presented and tasty. The dates were very good. Service was friendly and warm. We had a fun night."}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal from NYC for two days during a cold snap. Happened into this excellent restaurant. Delicious food, friendly service, sophisticated setting, and good-- but not overbearing--music. We really enjoyed our meal. My husband had the lobster and Gruyere Gilles cheese, which was delicious. I had the linguine with clam sauce, perfect for the sub-zero temperatures outside. Well dressed young crowd. Great wine; limited beer menu."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful , the decor is very unique , our waitress was a sweet heart , and the ambiance was really good as well . However I was not impress on their food . I expected it  to be very tasty but it was not . We had the linguini au palourde , onglet de beuf and entree mashrooms. Unfortunately I would not go back for the food maybe just for their 5-7 . Xo"}
{"text":"Mix feelings about this one.

Firstly, the booking process was exhausting (I had to call 3 times to make my reservation, and had to repeat my easy-to-get-non-pure-laine last name about 20 times - the girl simply couldn't understand there are names that do not have a French root), and even after that I received emails and phone calls to confirm the booking.

I was really impressed by the decor though, the place is really cool with large and high windows, which gives the place a lot of light. The service was average, with staff being borderline rude. The entrée (a clam carpaccio) was good, however very expensive for what's in the plate. The main made the dinner - a delicious porc chop.

All and all, for 100$ I had 1 cocktail, 1 glass of wine, 1 entrée and 1 main. Frankly, if I had to go back I would skip the entrée and the cocktail, as it is not good value for what it is.

Will I go back? No.
I'm glad I tried it, but frankly, I think a big chunk of the price is paying for the nice decor. Also, I consider service a part of the experience, and the booking shenanigans + the average service we had don't deserve the pricy bill we got at the end."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!! Get the bone marrow oxtail ragu and the octopus. Don't get the French onion dumplings"}
{"text":"Found this place online. It was brand new and already listed in the top 10 restaurants in Montreal. The atmosphere is wonderful and it had a very good vibe. Impeccable service from the get go. We just happened to be seated next to the chef's mother! Our meals were excellent to say the least. Steak with Asian chimichuri. When I asked if they could do something special for my wife's birthday, our server returned with a one off custom made desert. It was an great experience overall. To top things off, the chef came out to talk to his mom and she sent him to our table. We showered him with praise."}
{"text":"Pros: Excellent service.
Nice vibe.
Diverse menu.
Good for tapas or a heavy meal/
Accommodated 5 in short notice.

Cons:
Main course was cold.
Over priced paid 120 -145 each  all inclusive ( we were 4 and bill was 500 something)


 Overall 6.5/10 I could of gotten food as good , half the price especially in MTL"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant about 2 years ago after seeing Chef Matthieu win Chopped Canada. He was so creative on the show I couldn't wait to actually taste his food in real life!!! I believe he took his winnings and opened up Jellyfish Crudo+ Charbon- what a great story! Ok so the experience was very upscale, I felt very fancy. The decor is beyond beautiful, the lighting is dramatic and the wallpaper makes it feel regal yet comfortable. Now the food, the menu is small which I think is wonderful because they can create higher quality meals. We ordered the duck tataki with reeses pieces sauce, yes you read that right. Then I had the braised beef cheeks and my boyfriend had the steak with chimichuri sauce. We went for our 1 year anniversary, I am writing this review 2 years later and the fact that I can still remember what we ordered says a lot in my opinion! If you want a truly inspired food journey where every bite is exciting, this restaurant is for you."}
{"text":"I had only one night in Montreal, and the concierge at the W suggested this restaurant for dinner. Great choice.

The menu is more Eurasian fusion than European.  When there are kimchi and bao on the menu, you have Asian ingredients. The \"fusing\" was tastefully done, with the ingredients acting in subtle harmony. I much prefer this thoughtful approach over the wanna-be fusion restaurants that take the in-your-face approach and boldly mix western and eastern components together, without regard. 

Our server was very nice. 

The most memorable part of the meal was the red wine from Armenia.  I have never tasted wine from this part of the world before. Surprisingly, the wine was pretty good.  I went to Canada to drink Armenian wine. Yeah."}
{"text":"I've visited Jellyfish on a Saturday night and as I was solo, I was seated at the bar which is always a great idea: There were many groups of friends and couples seated there as well. The decor is really modern, I really liked their choice of chandeliers. 

I started with their \"Bacon Old Fashioned\" drink which was a-ma-zing, if I remember well it's a mix of Bourbon, orange and the cherry on the cake: Caramelized Bacon. I then ordered their beef tartare, the salmon and their croissant with white chocolate as dessert. Everything tasted very good, although I wasn't impressed by the croissant (I didn't like the burnt taste).

I would recommend this place for numerous reasons, their service, their food, and the overall experience. I will definitely be going back to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Both the food and the service at this restaurant is fantastic. I highly recommend getting multiple smaller items to share in order to try as many dishes as possible. Everything we tried was delicious. We will definitely be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"We started with the Octopus Lollypops and the Bao Crab Buns. 8.5/10

Then we had the Braised Veal Gnocchi and the Sirloin Steak. 6.3/10 For the Gnocchi and 7/10 for the Steak.

Sides: Lobster Mash: 8.7/10; Onion Rings: 5/10 & Brussels Sprouts with pancetta: 6.9/10. 

Ambiance: 7.8/10

Service at the table: 4.5/10.

Yes, we shall go back. Improve service and patrons dress code please."}
{"text":"Table of 6. We had a few apps to share: the carrots, cauliflower and scallops were really good. Burrata wasn't the best. I had the hanger steak cooked medium, liked it a lot."}
{"text":"We dined at Jellyfish for a friend's birthday and our overall experience was great. 

The decor is amazing and although it was a busy night for the restaurant, the logistics were great. We were quickly seated and service overall was good. 

I ordered the beef tataki and the burrata as appetizers, followed by the filet mignon. Although the kitchen initially sent out my steak cooked to the wrong temperature, our waitress promptly and expectedly took it back for a fresh one. The unexpected part was that the manager decided to comp the entire dish. This indicated to me that the establishment aspires to be more than just a hip and trendy venue and they actually care about the quality of the food served and overall customer satisfaction. 

I would highly recommend this restaurant for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Restaurant grandiose avec une atmosphère de bar. Décor magnifique, très tamisé, musique fun des années 80-90. La bouffe est vraiment excellente, fusion asiatique et européenne. Service impeccable. Très bons cocktails, bouteilles de vin à partir de 45$. Addition 100$ par personne. Portion très généreuses. Parking difficile dans le secteur mais service de valet."}
{"text":"I recently visited Jellyfish on a girl's trip to Montreal.  A local recommended the restaurant to us which is why we went there.  I liked that we could make a reservation on Opentable.  The decor and ambiance of the place is very nice.  Our waitress was very attentive and gave us a lot of good recommendations on the menu and also recommendations for things we should do in town during our visit.  We had the octopus tempura and the French onion soup dumplings to start.  The dumpling dish was very heavy.  The tempura was OK. There were a lot of other good starters recommended to us but due a food allergy, we couldn't get these items.  If I were to go back, I'd try the tuna crudo and avocado capaccio to start.  All 3 of us had the Hanger steak for an entree which came with the most delicious French fries.  For dessert, we had this smores dish which was incredible.   Not a cheap meal but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Just happened to be in Montreal staying in an Airbnb condo just steps from Jellyfish the week it opened. Place has a great vibe. Really nice and helpful staff. 

We had the scallop ceviche which was excellent. Raw scallops in a light sauce with a lot of complexity. 

Also had the softshell crab on a steamed bun with kimchi (they had a cooler name for it). Another excellent appetizer. Big enough for 2 to split. Worth it. 

The beef tartar was good but not the best we've had this week. Blue cheese sauce on the side was good but the whole dish was a bit salty. I still finished it. 

For an entre, we split the veal stew which was delightful. Rich sauce. Plenty of meat. Great comfort food. 

Finally, we shared the Jellyfish Donut (my name) dessert. This was two beignet/donuts made with carrot ricotta and a lemon custard. Excellent. Not too sweet. Perfect, actually. 

They had the usual minor startup issues with service but were really responsive and fixed things right away. We knew this was opening week, so we didn't expect perfection on everything. The staff and management was really engaged and wanted to know what we thought about everything. Great start for them. 

Go here."}
{"text":"Had a \"boys night out\" with a few friends I play hockey with.   Picked this restaurant from a list of recommended top new restaurants in Montreal.   

We arrived for our 8pm reservation on a saturday night.   Restaurant was just starting to get busy.   PK Subban happened to be eating there as well - my buddy Danny and I decided to send him a bottle of wine with a \"thank you for being PK\" - couldnt resist with all the great things he has been doing for the city.

back to the dinner.  The menu was great, lots of options for a starter, Crudo (raw), Hot and cold options... i chose the beat salad and it was delicious - sprinkled with beats, goat cheese... nice size plate for a starter and colorful with the read and yellow beats.   For the main course i chose the Veal/gnochi.... it was a good size portion, and every bite was delicious.   The service was excellent, our waitress really understood the menu and made great recommendations.   All the staff payed a lot of attention to us, even thought he restaurant was full at about 9pm... we didnt have to wait for anything.  Ambiance was great, not too noisy (high ceilings muffled a lot of the sound) and great view of the outside.  

We really enjoyed the restaurant, ran into the owner as we were leaving who insisted in buying us a shot for the road - nice touch to end a nice evening."}
{"text":"Best meal I've had anywhere this year, including trips to Shanghai and Tokyo.  Started out with the salmon tartare, which featured delicious pickles and my husband had the oyster nachos.  Shared incredible veal ribs and carrots with ricotta and miso.  So creative and pleasant, attentive service.  Good people watching, too!"}
{"text":"Simply put, yes and no. Went there the other night and the first dish (tuna) as good but the second (tomatoes) was very normal. Wine selection and recommendation was ok, but nothing unforgettable.

Tables were ok, but as we were close to the window on a colder night, I was way to windy and we couldn't close the big wall of Windows... no one offered to help or inquire on the subject which was evidently a problem for any customers.

I wouldn't say overpriced but close to. I guess this place could be fun for group of office people,but I wouldn't go there with friends and family.

PS. The first tu a plate was really good."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday, table of 12 girls. The service was good, the food was amazing. Even the chef came to see us ! I had a really great time despite other loud groups! Overall, 10/10 ! Loved it !"}

{"text":"As i walked in i was impressed by the chic decor and ambiance. The service was stupendous. 

For the most part everything we ordered was delicious besides my linguini (they gave me spaghetti) who failed to impress by the lack of flavour. The manager came to our table, apologized and even offered to cook it again for me. I kindly declined his generous offer as i picked at my friend's food and got full. 

He then offered us shots of his top shelf rhum. One of the best i've ever had. He then offered us other shots again, sweeter this time, before he left for the night. 

His service and ways to apologize would definitely make me go back."}
{"text":"Very good service, very nice decode, really good date spot, great location, awesome pre-going out spot but food is lacking. When I mean in lacking is quality and quantity.
Example: I asked for a Medium-Well steak and it came burned and was probably 4oz. If I wasn't on a date I would have returned the plate.

Worth a try but there are much better spots in the area. Sorry"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Loved the service and the atmosphere of the place. Certainly one of the best restaurants in Montréal! Would definitely be visiting again.
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Jelly Fish is a beautiful in decor as it is in its food and its patrons. The modern and yet ancien regime should be called \"quintessentially Montreal\" because it's reinvented the term. One of the benchmark new restaurants, the attractive space has black ceilings and excellent oysters. It seems as though every other table is topped with Icelandic Codfish or Japanese Snapper expertly prepared and served with a heaping side of broccoli with butta. Loved the experience, enjoyed the service, ate very well on the delicious and perfectly prepared fare."}
{"text":"Vieux-Montréal: Elegant, high ceilings, excellent Asian new French some South American fusion seafood, steak, slightly special occasion dining. Reminded me on Columbus Circle NYC"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant. Mo, our waiter was awesome. Made great suggestions, considerate to allergies, and was attentive despite being super busy. Good is delicious. Have the avacado carpaccio!  Great ambiance too. A must go experience!"}
{"text":"Been here 4 different time, each time it's amazing. They are so consistently good!!! We sit at the bar sometimes and sometimes we sit at a table. Always order a ton of sharing plates and everyone loves them! A definite must try!"}
{"text":"Delightful, decadent, and quality are just a few words to describe this restaurant. This dinner was planned by a buddy, I think we were 15 at the table. Service was top notch. They are a perfect example of service with a smile. The food here was really excellent. The French onion wonton soup (a first for me) was so so so good, I could have eaten about three bowls of it by myself. This was cheesy, lots of dumplings and the meat was seasoned to perfection. This is the best way to have French onion soup. It will be the only way that I'll eat it. At the table we had the Salmon Tartar which has lemongrass, ginger soy, puffed rice, pickled veggies. We had some thing like a tuna tar tar with beets, peanuts and a nice sauce. Also an avocado salad with a crispy cheese chip and my goodness this hit the spot. 
Oysters nachos Jellyfish which have tomatillas, short ribs marmalade, gruyere had a magnificent taste, everything blended perfectly. My neighbor had the half chicken with Boursin and a yellow miso butter, I had a small peace and felt like heaven from the juiciness and good of flavors. 
The Veal short ribs has Kimchi, peanuts, soy and ginger. This too tasted good. I had a piece that didn't have peanuts on it. This was another good selection from the table. Now I had the Hanger steak which was 8 oz of goodness, juicy well cooked and had a tasty asian chimichurri sauce with shaved parmesan cheese in it. We had a smores platter for dessert and this too was excellent. Over all I had a great experience.


The waitress was good to me, let me know what ingredients were in each item; as I had told her some foods that don't agree with me. That also made the experience great. All drinks were liked by my folks at the table. I don't do alcohol, so can only comment based on my folks likes."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service. Heard so many good things of the food so wanted to try it. Tried to go there 2 days ago for lunch at 1:55pm but was told kitchen closed already which made me wonder.  Today I went there and waited outside for over 10 minutes for someone to seat me on a quasi empty patio but to no avail. One waitress inside kept talking to her table forever without acknowdging me and God knows where everyone else was inside. Totally insulting. 10 minutes is a long time to stand at the entrance of a resto. Too bad for them cause it's conveniently located in front of me. Went again next door to Pizzaiole, which was very good, service was fast and courteous.  Will never go back as this is a reflection of their arrogance."}
{"text":"The food was good but the drinks are why I would come back. I kid u not their drinks are amazing!!!I want to try them all! I had the bloody Caesar and it had red miso in it which I found was unique because I've never seen that before. It was so so so good !! I also had the old fashioned which was garnished with a slice of BACON ! I also tried their sangria because everyone in the restaurant was drinking it and I admit that I was intrigued. It wasn't my favorite of the three drinks but it was a very refreshing summer drink. Now for the food... the scallop carpaccio was good at first bite but then had a weird after taste that I didn't like. We then had the salmon tartar which was fresh but nothing special. I personally really enjoyed the lobster grilled cheese. Lobster is good...grilled cheese is good... so what's not to like! ;) My cousin wasn't too impressed because she said she could just make it at home but I really enjoyed it. We also shared the bao bun soft shell crab with kimchi mayo. If you want a bao bun wit soft shell crab go to satay brothers. It's amazing! Mostly because the bao bun is deep fried and anything deep fried is fantastic!! The bao bun at jellyfish though definitely has more crab in the buns FYI. 
I have  recommended this place to my friends and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Yumm! This place was so good! The interior design was really sharp. The food was absolutely out of this world. The service was really top of the line. Yours to discover. Wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best addition to Old Montreal dining scene in a long time. The decor is spectacular and has this very warm cozy feeling to it. Sitting at the bar for dinner was great. The staff is professional and caring. Robbie (the owner) tends to his guest like family members. My food was perfect. The selection will please meet lovers and vegetarians as well. Can't wait to tell all my friends about it! Must try: Yellow beets 5 ways, Charcoaled heirloom carrots, the scallop carpaccio and the signature hanger steak with chimichurri will take you to food paradise. JellyFish Montreal is a must try for 2016"}
{"text":"At Jellyfish you see and are seen. Food and drinks are optional. 

Every care and precaution has been taken to stimulate your \"How do I look?\" gland. The street facing walls, composed of unobstructed glass sliding doors sitting beneath large french windows, invites unlimited ogling next to the opaque stone facades of its Old Port neighbourhood. To reach the entrance you'll be watched striding down a long stone walkway where a lush red carpet ought to be installed in perpetuity. Once inside, there's almost no way to reach your seat without crossing at least one side length of the prodigious centrepiece bar, facilitating up-down eyeballing between guests and waitstaff alike. And, so you don't forget how trendy this place is, your bill is delivered to you paper-clipped to a unique and somewhat kitsch souvenir postcard, the current hallmark of all great on-trend restaurants. If anything, the point of Jellyfish is maximizing your excitement about telling your friends you ate at Jellyfish. 

Full disclosure: trying to impress was at least a 60% factor in inviting my out of town friend for dinner there. Also I'm a total sucker for the postcard as souvenir thing.

If status signalling isn't your thing, the food might be worth all the peacock-ing. The menu reflects the large playground provided by the raw/grilled thematic, which is to say it eschews any standard style or ingredient pairings in favour of whatever is striking chef Mathieu Masson Duceppe's imagination this season. Much of the effort seems to have been spent on small \"look how clever we are\" flourishes, e.g., scallops with popcorn béchamel, or \"Reese's Pieces\" duck tataki with peanut and dark chocolate sauce. Are we extras on a audition reel for Chef's Table? Still there's a certain thoughtfulness at work I think justifies the braggadocio. Our oysters, for example, were served with fresh sea beans (picture baby asparagus) as a crunchy, salty alternative to a boring old salt shaker. These are the small details where a memorable meal starts. 

If everything begs for your attention, the desserts stand up to scrutiny and then some. Decadent, tart, and full-bodied, our lime/white chocolate pie had us sucking on our spoons and rolling our eyes over until the bowl was scrapped clean. We exchanged \"can you believe how good this is!?\" glances with a couple seated next to us frozen in a similar ecstatic stupor by their dessert. I'd be fond of Jellyfish as a place to end long conversations over wine and sugar but any intimacy here is checked at the door.

Of all the sights, sounds, and tastes, it's unfortunate I can't blank out our lackadaisical waiter, who seemed to want to be anywhere but at our table. Every question was met with a nearly audible sigh in body and expression. I'm sure our waiter gets asked for wine recommendations all day but here at Jellyfish asking \"What should we drink?\" seems to be the entire point. I don't think we were supposed to order our drinks feeling like we told a teenager he couldn't watch TV until after he finished all his homework. He didn't even even mention the bespoke salty sea beans, earning us more silent groaning when we asked him to find a boring old salt shaker for us. Part of offering an eclectic menu is taking us beyond our culinary comfort zone. The waitstaff's enthusiasm and knowledge is crucial in selling that experience. At a place where a 3 digit bill is unavoidable, I can't forgive bad service. I start chopping stars. But as I said food and drink might be besides the point; I'm still happy to tell anyone who'll listen I've been to Jellyfish."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner ... Ate appetizers and drinks.  Everything was excellent ... For dessert I HIGHLY recommend the bacon/Jamison/maple bread pudding.

There is not a thing that I would change ..."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be called Aziatique and it has been transformed into one of the nicest restaurants in Montreal. 

Very trendy and posh....They did an amazing job on the layout and design. You do not feel like you are in Montreal. 

I went on a Thursday later at night  for drinks and it was packed.

Service was great and will definitely go back again for drinks and meal. 

PS: they have valet parking"}
