{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped in for the first time on a Monday afternoon. We took a little bit to order, but the guy up front who baked our pizzas was patient and really good with offering us different options. At first, we only wanted one pizza, but after seeing how good our first one was turning out we wanted another. They have a Coke freestyle machine which is awesome. Delicious pizza and really cool people working there. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a recommendation from a friend and had some really good pizza. Service was friendly and quick.  Had the vegetarian and green machine.  As noted by others very fresh ingredients.  Some of the better  thin crust pizza in the area.  Portions were good.

Only down side was the large family with small kids running around while the parents watched to see if anyone else though they were cute. 

Definitely will go back to try some other combos."}
{"text":"The pizza basically is cooked on a belt fed toaster.  I am used to pizza from an oven.  Also the \"bakd\" stoner theme is weak and not somewhere where I would trust the food.  The staff is lackluster and I cant really understand how this place stays in business."}
{"text":"Order took over 75 minutes to arrive. We ordered pizza and hoagies. Food was bad. We all got sick after eating it. Will not be ordering takeout from there again."}
{"text":"This place was so much better when you could order your pizza through the line subway-style. It's still the same delicious pizza, but the dining experience was awful. Our food took forever to come out and none of the three pizzas at our table were correct (it  was like they took our pizzas and mixed and matched the toppings). It then took forever for the remakes to come out and in the meantime we had the pleasure of watching the kid making our food play with his hair, his phone, and generally touch things while preparing our orders (they don't wear gloves!). The new management completely lost sight of what made this such a great pizza joint (except the amazing pizza) and even though this was our favorite pizza place in the Pittsburgh area, I'm not sure we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I shared this same review on Facebook. I wanted to place on yelp as well, as I personally check several places before trying a new restaurant..

Visited last week. The restaurant has a large bar to the right as you enter, we decided to sit at the bar. We enjoyed the layout and atmosphere. Really cool space. We chatted with the owner, who was tending bar, and he was very friendly and engaging. It was not busy. Several folks came in to dine while we were there, all seemed to be very happy, paying compliments about their food.  

I had a wine in tap (Pinot Grigio, which I never drink but he gave me a sample and I liked it so ordered a glass), my husband had a couple different beers. They have a really great craft beer selection, so it's certainly not you're average pizza and beer joint. 

We decided to try two pizzas, the Joyous Joe and the Bianco Verde. We were not disappointed. Great flavor. You could tell that they are using great ingredients. Both choices were delicious. I was full after a couple of pieces, and we ended up boxing up some of each pizza home, which we excitedly enjoyed for a snack later. 

We will absolutely be back and hope to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Pizza is no good. Dough was super dry and barely any sauce. I had higher expectations and it disappointed. Salads were ok. Happy hour only at the bar which was also so disappointing.  There was like no one in there and it still took long to get our food. Go to Blaze Pizza in settlers ridge, so much better!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have ever had! They have a nice selection on the menu with a large variety. The ingredients are tasty and delicious.  I wish it wasn't so close to my house because I might go daily."}
{"text":"I have passed this place quite a few times and finally decided to give it a try. We got two different pizzas and they were both excellent. Service was exceptional and the staff was friendly. The  ingredients were fresh. They have a great selection of craft beers and a very nice bar area. I am definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"Pizza use to be good. Ingredients and dough must have changed. Crust was thin and tough. Not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Interesting concept but disappointed.  The pizza is small - more like a personal pan pizza.. the size of a dinner plate.    I ordered just a typical pepperoni pizza.   I do not even need to tell you what I ordered because it doesn't matter. Lets talk about the amount of pepperoni that was on my pizza... 7 tiny pieces pepperoni spread out over the little pizza (see picture I uploaded).  I do not expect it to be full of pepperoni but come on ..    I could barely taste it was pepperoni.   It was pathetic.  I laughed when I saw the pizza actually.  A small pizza with sauce, cheese and 1 topping and a drink came to $9.61. If I were to get more toppings the price keeps going up.  
The pizza was ok - nothing great about it. The pizza crust is very basic and thin.   Sure you get your three choices of crust but they are all the same consistency.  I think this type of establishment is better for kids birthday parties - not for an adult wanting a personal pizza.  The restaurant was clean and plenty of seating in the dining area.  Picture a subway restaurant - but its pizza instead of sandwiches.    The concept was intriguing but doubt I will be back to visit."}
{"text":"Bakd was a hit!  We tried the Detroit style with unlimited toppings and were more than happy with our food and service.  Cauliflower on pizza?  Yes, please!  And do not miss the balsamic vinaigrette.  Our server was thoughtful, witty and a pleasure to chat with.  Even the owner checked in on us to say hello!  Our daughter thought the world of her brownie dessert and we are happy to have a lovely leftover lunch of pizza for tomorrow!"}
{"text":"In a sea of neon, fast food and corporate cuisine, it is easy to overlook diamonds in the rough like this.  Bak'd has become a go to, every Sunday afternoon.  From the fantastic, cooked to order pizza, fresh crisp salads and an excellent beer selection, a delicious meal is always guaranteed."}
{"text":"Hey, we visited Bakd Pizza today for the first time.  We got a 16\" Green Pizza and the two of us devoured it.  It was so good.  We will certainly go back even though we really don't live very close.  Oh BTW we had terimisu for dessert just as good as NYC.  and I assure you I don't know a soul involved with that restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed with my trip to bak'd! I was so looking forward to coming and building my own pizza in the line where I could see all the toppings and pick what I wanted but that wasn't the case with my recent trip. They remodeled since the last time I was in and they no longer offer the line services. I was told to go and sit at the bar whwrr the waiter would take my order.  He handed me a menu with some options on it &  I ordered the Burke BBQ 10\" (advertised as 8 cuts). He immediately handed me my check before I could ask for anything to drink & then when I asked for a fountain drink he told me he only had 3 options to chose from. I was very disappointed hearing that because the last time i was in they had a coke machine with a million different options of sodas! My pizza only took about 7 minutes to come out, and it tasted delicious! It was only a 4 cut pizza though. Overall, I was just disappointed with the new renovations and liked the old bakd better :/"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in on a Monday evening and we both were very impressed by this place! Cute atmosphere, local fresh ingredients, a few local beers, and the prices were fair for the large portions! Great service! Our server Micheal was ver friendly and he seemed to actually like his job and cared about pleasing the customer. The owner even stopped by to check on us! My boyfriend ordered the Italian sub ( I can't remember the actual name of it) and it was large enough to feed a whole family! It comes with homemade chips and a side of French onion dip, which was delicious! I had the BBQ chicken pizza with cheddar cheese and grilled onions and it was also very good. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place used to be like a subway but with pizza. It was a quick enjoyable way to get a meal. What it now looks like is if a guy bought a McDonald's and tried to turn it into a 5 star restaurant.  The new management took what was once a great thing and completely ruined it.  Do not waste your time and money. Go to Blaze instead."}
{"text":"We have ordered twice now and both times it's been wrong and they've forgotten food. The food is really good but we already waited an hour for our food now we have to wait another hour plus to get my husbands food. It's also extremely expensive. Especially since they don't get the orders right!"}
{"text":"Interesting place, the location wouldn't suggest the industrial slash modern decor you'll find inside.  The staff was very nice in greeting us and taking us to our tables.  The occasion in which we were there for lunch, they did seem understaffed with just 1 person on the floor and 1 person on the kitchen.

Pricing is inline with the other offerings in the area.  And the menu seems varied enough that most tastes will be satisfied including those with dietary restrictions.  While we didn't partake in the libations, the bar area seems pretty well stocked and with lots of seating."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The first time we went we had a bit of a rough experience but the owner made it right and we gave them another shot and we are SO happy that we did! Everything was outstanding.  The staff was so friendly and helpful.  The place was super clean and the food was INCREDIBLY delicious.  I cannot rave enough about this facility.  Definitely try it."}
{"text":"4 of us went in and split 2 10-inch pizzas. The sizes were absolutely perfect for sharing and we devoured the pizza. It was extremely fresh and flavorful. We ordered their recipe pizzas off the menu and customized to our tastes. The owner came up and talked with us and was so sweet, and absolutely hysterical. We had a fantastic time and will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, awesome online ordering and prompt delivery. Great addition to Robinson. Love the specialty pizzas! Can't wait to try them all. The pesto chicken was amazing!"}
{"text":"Tried the Veg Out Sierra w/ balsamic glaze drizzles on it - Very tasty.  Meatball - not that great; supposed to have ricotta cheese, but could barely see any.  Staff needs to be more efficient in cleaning tables.  One employee sitting w/ friends while I assume the other in back - at this time there were at least 4 dirty tables.  Your job comes first.  Not to mention the prep table needed cleaned up."}
{"text":"The employees are very conscientious about cross contamination; the man making my gluten free pizza changed gloves before starting, kept my pizza separate from the others, and used a separate pizza cutter to cut it."}
{"text":"First try started with their bread kind of focochi and dipping sauce, tasted good.
I had greens and beans with their hot sausage spinage, can white beans, and canned tomatoes. The pizza ok sandwiches again ok but nothing to write home about. 
Second try about the same wedding soup ok baked pasta ok nothing bad but nothing that great ether. 
I try to give places three shots so I owe them one more."}
{"text":"As a pizza snob, I feel like all pizza in the Pittsburgh area tastes the same - until I tried bakd. The sauce has a robust and fresh flavor, not like the other places around town that taste like they're right out of a can. Delivery is super quick too! DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"PPIIIZZZZAA!!! This place is awesome, you guys. Each pizza is crafted to be for one person, but could easily be split between 2 people (if you're the type who likes to share your pizza; who are these people tho? lolz). I ordered a create-your-own complete with pesto, mozzarella and ricotta cheeses, artichoke hearts and caramelized onions, chicken, and topped with garlic oil. My boo ordered the Totally Bakd and housed it before I could even snap a pic, so, basically, that was his confirmation that it was delish (I did see it, and it looked yummy). It was about $20 for 2 fantastic pizzas that were loaded with toppings. Eat here, peeps, because I really hope this place sticks around."}
{"text":"We were having a torrential summertime downpour, and I got hungry for pizza for lunch. I just happened to see the word \"pizza\" in their signage and thought I would try it out.

The interior is nice - shiny/glossy surfaces and a mixture of dark and bright colors. The décor kind of reminded me of a 1960's cafeteria. Not sure why because it doesn't look like a cafeteria!

A lot of options which is nice. I decided to try something different so I got meatball as the topping for my pizza.  The crust is thin, and I liked the crust.  There was too much cheese for my liking and I couldn't tell whether the meatballs had any flavor. I think all the flavor came from the pizza sauce, which tasted good.  The size of the pizza was too much. I think it should feed two people, but I was alone and pizza is my kryptonite so I ate the whole thing.

I get the feeling that this is fast food pizza.  I think everything is shipped to them as-is and they thaw/assemble/cook it on demand.  Maybe most pizza places do the same, but for the price I think this should be freshly made pizza dough and freshly made sauce.

Next time I will ask to go light on the cheese."}
{"text":"Good pizza and next door to the bike shop I always go to. Good pizza, quick. I love that it was gluten-free and dairy-free. Price was reasonable.

{"text":"Pretty disappointing. My main issue is how they deal with Groupons--six of us went to eat after our granddaughter's soccer game--my husband, our daughter and three kids. My daughter and I both had our own Groupons. We were instructed by the lady bartender, to sit at the big table. My husband and I were paying for ourselves and our grandson-our daughter paying for the two girls. Upon choosing our orders--(we were paying on TWO separate checks with TWO separate bank cards, from TWO separate banks--with TWO entirely different last names on the accounts). Then the waitress informs us we are only allowed \"one Groupon per table\"...bad business policy! So, if three couples decide to meet and have lunch together--TWO couples have to forfeit the use of their Groupons???!!! How is that fair??? In these times--this is the PURPOSE of Groupons--to save money on meals. But, despite the fact that these are clearly three separate families--you either must pay FULL price (except for one \"lucky\" couple; and by the way, how do you then choose WHO?!) or sit at THREE SEPARATE TABLES?!!! The policy should be \"one Groupon per check/transaction\"!!! Needless to say, we were very disappointed/unhappy (however, we never conveyed anger or disrespect to any employees like some idiots would--we politely paid as instructed). We won't be back. The home made sausage on our pizza WAS delicious, the red sauce had a spice in it that they could have left out(oregano perhaps) and only one person(my husband) \"loved\" the crust...not enough good reasons to come back. The bartender who served our drinks, was \"ok\" but the younger blonde waitress who took our order was VERY nice and helpful...still...not returning. Sorry, we really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and all around experience! They stayed open on a slow night, were incredibly attentive and had truly exceptional food!"}
{"text":"Great food and great craft beer! I would recommend this place to friends and family. I'd rather go here than any other chain restaurant in Robinson"}
{"text":"This place has a really great hipster vibe on the inside of you're into that...which I am. The pizza is well made, delicious, and not expensive. I paid about $17 for 2 whole pizzas and a drink. I will definitely go back and I hope more people find out about it so they stay in business. :)"}
{"text":"...took the family here as it was my last night with the annual golf trophy. All in all a pretty good dining experience with a good beer selection and huge menu. Won't be back though as one of the waiters was carrying a gun..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner tonight. My first visit. I was very impressed. I ordered a pizza and sat at the bar. Staff was very pleasant and attentive. They also scored high on the nice scale. I had a regular crust pizza. The 10 inch is 4 slices. The crust was delicious and the toppings were fresher than most of the competition I've tried to date. None of the fussiness about artisanal this or that either, lol. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Very average pizza nothing remarkable here. Will not go back. I'd be surprised if it survives a year."}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped here for lunch today.  We were interested in trying out this place because they offered a choice of pizzas including gluten-free (My wife is GF (Note: slight upcharge on the gluten free crust)), and also because they offer organic produce toppings and non-gmo ingredients.  The concept is simple, you can order specialty pizzas from off of the menu, or you can create your own by picking and choosing the various ingredients that are presented before you, similar to the way you would order a Subway or Chipotle.  We both created our own (see photos to see what they looked like). The pizzas were cooked fast, and had an O.K. taste, not really anything especially delicious or fancy, and they were large enough that we each ate half, and took the other half home for later.  Overall, not a bad place if you are looking for a quick, customizable, and reasonably healthy meal.  The only problem I encountered was that I asked for light cheese, and the guy making my pizza started throwing this massive pile of cheese on, and I reminded him, LIGHT CHEESE, and then he scooped some off, but it was still more than I wanted.  He said he was used to putting lots of cheese on them."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate here the other day since they were on Groupon.  Friendly service, Good food, good pricing.  I only wish more people were there - it was trivia night and it seemed empty.

Gun friendly which is a plus and rare."}
{"text":"Create your own pizza (salads too).  Or order one of the bakd creations.  It is fast, fresh and a cafeteria line like Subway and Chipotle.  Takes about 3 or 4 minutes to bake your pizza.  
Pick you crust, pick your sauce (8 to chose from), pick your cheese (9 cheeses), pick your toppings of veggies (about 15 varieties) and protein (11 options), add some oil if you wish and/or some finishing flavors.  There are some oils and peppercorn at the drink stand so you can put some on your pizza tray to dip your crust in, too.

bakd is in a large space that has been a Korean and Mexican restaurant but is completely redone.  Nice wood tables and green chairs.  

I created my own pizza with the traditional crust, with the spicy tomato sauce, with pepperoni and Italian hot sausage.  The crust was cooked just right and soft and chewy but with some brown crisp edge.  The spicy tomato sauce was spicy but not to spicy, probably not for everyone but I enjoyed it.  The pepperoni and sausage were good.  The Italian sausage was somewhat hot and not as good as my favorite but was put on in small pieces and better than most pizza shop sausage."}
{"text":"An excellent place to hang out after work, eat some great pizza, have a few beers, and shoot the breeze w/ Rob and his staff. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Not so great. Pizza was burned, the toppings were only in the middle of the pizza and the crust was dry. If the toppings were dispersed evenly, the pizza would have been a bit better. What little toppings we had were very tasty, though. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent place to get some great food! Awesome bar as well! Defiantly a cool place to go and hang out!"}
{"text":"I have often passed this place and finally decided to stop in. The sign is misleading because it is placed above the Altmeyer's sign which would lead me to believe it was located upstairs. In actually it is ground level in a space that another restaurant once was.

Once inside there was hardly anyone there so the counter person was able to guide me. You have a choice of building your own 10\" pizza from scratch or ordering one of their \"bakd creations\" as they call them Those pizzas range from $6.59-$9.79 depending upon choice.

Should you opt to build it yourself then you would start with a choice of 3 different types of dough, choose your sauce and cheese, then toppings, oils, and what they call \"finishes\" for your pizza. If you choose 4 or more toppings then the price is fixed at $9.79. They also have signature salads on the menu or you can build your own as with the pizza.

They do offer one dessert but decided to pass on that one. As I was ordering a drink they asked me if I wanted a fountain or bottled. I asked for ice tea but that didn't come in their fountain beverages. I had a choice of sweet tea or unsweetened. I went with the latter.

I went to a table and opposite me there is the fountain beverages where you can get ice for your cup. There is also canisters marked \"forks\" and \"spoons\". I only noticed that there were plastic knives in the fork canister. The man brought my pizza over to me promptly and I pointed this out. He also admitted when I asked for sugar that they had no sugar packets but realized he needed to get some as well as plastic forks. They did bring me a sugar bowl and a wrapped fork for me to use.

The pizza is sliced thin and was just okay. The toppings were good however. They do have near the fountain area boxes where you can create your doggie bag if need be. Once you are finished there is a trash area so you can leave your tray and disposables.

I picked up a brochure and as I was leaving I saw their van for delivery. The brochure also says they do catering and they have an online ordering at the website which is bakdpizza.com.

I am glad that you do get fast service and it seems to me that since they just appear to be starting out they have much to learn. Still I wasn't disappointed with my pizza. I ate it all and really liked the fact that they had it sliced thin."}
{"text":"Really like the concept and the atmosphere. Although the staff wasn't one to remember. My son loved it! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I saw that this place had a pretty nice selection and wanted to try it. Looking at some of the other reviews here immediately before I went, I got a bit skeptical. Boy, I'm glad I went to experience it for myself. This place has a fantastic selection of craft beer, wine, and other libations. We had the loaded fries and the \"Totally Bakd\" pizza. Both were amazing. The staff was fantastic and the owner came to check how we were and struck up friendly conversation. 

An absolutely great dining experience."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great service, great people...but a terrible spot. There's a sign for some app named Altmeyers that may cause you to miss it. Don't though...you'll be happy."}
