{"text":"One of the best fish sandwich's in the Burg.  Huge portion and nicely prepared, a must have."}
{"text":"It's a great place to grab a quick lunch, especially if you're interested in a great Reuben sandwich. The proportions are generous, the prices are reasonable, and the ambiance is what you would expect at a golf club restaurant. There are lots of TVs all over the dining area, so you won't miss a second of the big game as you enjoy their homemade potato chips, which are certainly a must have."}
{"text":"On a Friday during Lent, crab balls, mozz, eggplant parmagian and fish dinners satisfy. Thanks Chef David Ayn for the perfect pasta side dressed with one of the best simple tomato sauces in Pittsburgh. And the waitstaff is both friendly and proficient, and very 'burgh-like."}
{"text":"First visit here for a trivia contest.  They were overwhelmed, and couldn't handle the crowd.  It took two hours for our pizza to arrive (the game was almost over when it finally came), and then afterwards, we got the bill with numerous items added on that our table did not order.  Also, they brought our table two french fry baskets, one an hour later after the one we ordered was already eaten, and then the server insisted we ordered the second one, which we hadn't.  Nice overall place, (see photos), but was underwhelmed with it last night."}
{"text":"Great place for sandwich, salad and refreshments after golf.  They are open for dinner and have a new chef...forgot who.   Have been here for charity golf and the food was good.

Today, ate in Sammy's and had a very good Apple Walnut salad with chicken and raspberry vinaigrette dressing.  It was huge...way to much for me!"}
