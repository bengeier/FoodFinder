{"text":"The staff was very nice, service was quick, and the restaurant was clean! My husband had a BLT and said it was really good, I had chicken salad on pumpernickel... Yum! And the check was less than $15!! Very nice find for a quick deli lunch! Will be back! :)"}
{"text":"I got over my initial disappointment that this is not what anyone who frequents delis in NYC or other big cities would call a deli, and I must say, the food, although decidedly modest in culinary ambition, is consistently good.  The fact that all profits go to charity, per owner JD Gibbs' design), is also cool."}
{"text":"This is a go to hangover sandwich in college turned lunch time favorite--the STP Turkey with formula 45 sauce could it eat weekly."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Angel Salad for lunch today.  Mine came with lettuce, tomatoes, \"cukes\", and dressing.  If you aren't worried about a diet you should try it with bacon!  I got the Formula 95 dressing and loved it!  I was sort of surprised the set up was to have waitstaff and table service in a deli, but the young lady who waited on us was very nice."}
{"text":"Great food, fast, rationally priced. Staff was awesome.   It totally met all expectancy"}
{"text":"I have always loved Grouchos, but since I've moved I don't have one close by anymore. I decided after a visit to Discovery Place I would stop in with my boys  (3 and 1 years old). It was a terrible idea on my part bc they were exhausted, but the girls in this Grouchos were amazing! I really hate I didn't get one girl's name in particular. My 3 yr old had a melt down bc I got him a PB&J and he wanted just jelly. The sweet girl brought out a jelly sandwich for him when she heard him upset. She brought crayons and tried everything to help out. He left happier when we left because this patient, kind girl! The Wife's salad bowl was amazing as usual! But the service in this Grouchos is an added bonus!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a New York style nasty, dirty and crowded Deli with attitude behind the counter.. This isn't it. This place is kept clean as new with staff that is happy to serve you. There is a lot to choose from here or you can order up your own concoction.. And they just added shakes ;) My favorite sandwich is the Big Dipper but I have a bunch of others that come close to knocking it off the top. Try the 45 sauce, you will not be disappointed. (The bread alone will make you want to come back)."}
{"text":"Very impressed! Great prompt service, and great food. Try the signature dipping sauce.   Will be back for sure.  Restraunt style dining, but I did take out."}
{"text":"Great sandwhich place, not your \"normal\" sub shop which is nice nice staff, quick service"}
{"text":"I am not sure if I ate at the same restaurant as all of these other reviewers. My husband and I came in for a first visit for dinner tonight and were supremely disappointed by what we received.  We have been to some really great delis before and this wasn't even a particularly good deli. The only reason I am giving it a 2 instead of a 1 star is because the server was very friendly and the food came out quickly. When we were choosing a table, we had to move 3 times because all of the tables had crumbs and droplets of sauces on them. But, dirty tables aside, the food was the major disappointment. When you think of a sandwich from a true deli, you think of piles of meat. In fact the menu at Groucho's even has the words \"piles of\" in many of the sandwich descriptions. Yet when our sandwiches came out the meat was super slim. We looked at each other as if to ask if we were being punked. I could have made both of these sandwiches at home for half the price of one of them at Groucho's. My turkey sandwich was very sad. It had maybe 4 pieces of turkey and one leaf of lettuce on a squishy sesame seed hamburger bun. My husband had the international dipper which had an equally sad amount of meat on it. We agreed that the 500 calorie turkey sub at Firehouse has more meat on it than Groucho's turkey sandwich. To top it off, the meat quality was poor. It has that slimy over processed texture of the store brand meat in the deli case or that turkey that comes in the 99 cent packet in the cooler case with the other sandwich meats. It certainly did not have a turkey texture. Needless to say, we will not be back."}
{"text":"I agree with the positive reviews on here. Not an authentic NY deli but tasty enough to satisfy an Indian Land craving. Very friendly table service. Menu is sandwiches and salads, and a soup and a chili."}
{"text":"We tried this deli about 2 months ago and we were extremely disappointed. If you want to go somewhere and get deli meat from the grocery store, this is what it is like! I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"A gem of a deli here in Huntersville! I've been meaning to try Groucho's for a while but just got around to it this weekend. So glad I finally did!   I got a turkey sandwich called a White Moose, and it was simple and delicious. Sandwiches come with a pickle (yum) and chips (yum), and then an absurd amount of some sort of dipping sauce (surprisingly yum). I could have bathed a small child in the amount of dipping sauce they sent with me, but I wouldn't do that because I'd just have to bathe them all over again afterwards (to get off all of the dipping sauce, duh). Turkey was good quality, the bun was soft and fresh.   Price seemed fair given that the sandwich comes with a pickle and chips. Service was fast, even with a pretty full house and at an off-hour. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fast service - but if you're expecting a new york pastrami sandwich - this isn't the place for you. Seemed a little out of balance. Potato salad was good that came with it."}
{"text":"No, just no!!! Squishy strange texture meat......... to me this isn't much of a deli at all. Sandwich place tops. The staff was very nice though but not at all impressed by the food.  I got a sandwich with a combo of Pastrami and Corned Beef. Didn't like the Russian dressing either."}
{"text":"We eat here a lot. The food is always fresh and the services is excellent. The Apollo sandwich is our favorite (usually just get the turkey apollo). The formula 45 sauce is off the hook!! Another one that is great is the Reuben (Turkey). Every sandwich we've ordered has been great. If you are unable to sit inside, the outside seating is nice too."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying with my dad and overall it was pretty great. My dad's Ruben sandwich looked better than mine but the flavor was not lacking. Staff was very kind which always makes the experience so much better. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Second trip to Groucho's first trip was mediocre but I have them the benefit of the doubt as it was their first week of business. I ordered the BLT which should have been pretty easy to execute.  Sandwich was 3 slices of bread, a slice and a half of tomato, bacon crumbles that wouldn't stay on the sandwich, and some wilted lettuce.  The only to describe it is DRY and CHEWY.    I was in for a late lunch around 3PM.  I'll give them another shot because they are in a convenient location but this trip was less than satisfactory."}
{"text":"There's so many things going wrong at this deli.    I'm a first time customer and typically give the benefit of the doubt but in this case I don't see this being an isolated problem.  It's pretty typical of smaller businesses to overlook these things so I'll make my opinion clear.    1. Every customer that walks in your doors needs to be greeted,  not asked \"is this for here or to go. \" You should ask the customer if they've been to your place and ask them if they have questions about the menu\". * The lady working there was flustered because \"they got slammed\" and was out of breath and kinda just in a manic state. It was very uncomfortable to witness.    2. #checkyourwork ... After ordering I took a seat,  there was another gentleman standing next to me that had already been waiting on his food. Looking towards the kitchen you could see the manic lady pass a to-go bag to a worker and sort of point in our general direction, so the worker promptly brought it to me and said thank you. The guy that was waiting and I kinda looked at each other and I double checked to make sure it wasn't his food...turns out it was. That was an unnecessary error that could have been avoided.   3. Who was the genius that decided you shouldn't have a self-serve drink station?  It's about the most asinine thing I've ever seen that a small staffed deli would dedicate work force to making drinks,  complete waste of resources. I asked for a refill before I left but due to you being too busy, that clearly didn't happen.  I served myself, so thanks.   4. The food...I ordered the giant or epic or whatever the heck size it's called...supposed to be HUGE. Lol,  it was smaller than a regular firehouse sub. For the money I felt like I got taken advantage of. Oh,  and thanks for the wilted lettuce side salad...I had two bites of that before it went in the trash.    A complete and total nightmare of an experience. I wouldn't step back in your doors if someone else was paying. Your deli is rubbish."}
{"text":"Been going to Groucho's Deli for awhile and the Indian Land location is one of my favorites from the other locations because of the great customer service and the proximity to Ballantyne. There's not much to say about the decor because Groucho's doesn't pretend to be something they're not. When you walk in, the restaurant is small and sometimes can be very busy but it doesn't take long to get a table. It's a simple come in get a table or booth and order your food.  They have a simple, no frills menu and the wait staff has always been courteous and helpful. My favorite combination is the Big Dipper Sandwich with Formula 45 sauce and the Just Bacon soup. The sandwich is definitely on my top ten list when it comes to subs and there are many sub places I've been to. For the quality of the sandwiches and the portion size they offer, Grocho's is definitely worth the money and visit."}
{"text":"These guys are great. Takes me back to my college days in 5 Points. Good quality and the crushed ice in the drinks should be mandatory at other places.  Staff is friendly and quick.   Have been three times and the place is my go-to when I just feel like a good sammie, and maybe a little Froyo after across the street.  Try the sauces."}
{"text":"Very good! I've been waiting for a deli lime this where you can walk in and order a great sandwich without it having to be a sub. I got the tuna tomato cheese melt on toasty white bread. The special sauce is a tangier version of big Mac sauce (1000 island). Nice place for lunch or a low key, simple dinner. Look forward to going again."}
{"text":"Anyone from SC knows this is a college kid tradition. There are a few reviews on here talking about how it is not a NY deli... Nope, it is not. It's a SC tradition and I won't complain about NY delis not tasting like Groucho's if you won't complain about Groucho's not tasting like NY delis. Get one of the dippers and love it forever. They throw a couple of crappy salads on there to make the dieters happy, but let's get real, Groucho's is all about the dippers, the college atmosphere, and the bread the size of your head to soak up the hangover. If you are looking for the Groucho's experience, you can't beat the five points location, but Indian land is clean and scratches the itch for those of us missing our SC glory days. Thanks for bringing it to Indian Land!"}
{"text":"Great service and portions. Nice variety on the menu too. Hubby had the meatball sub and said it was the best he ever had. I had the turkey lite (i think they call it a white moose or something) it was good too and came with pretzels (I'm on a diet). Kids liked the hotdogs and cookies. We'll come back and dig into the menu some more."}
{"text":"Good Food and all Profits go to Charity.  Interesting concept but a bit of background.  This restaurant is owned by JD Gibbs and his wife Melissa. JD is the son of Joe Gibbs and the President of Joe Gibbs racing.  The Gibb's family has always given back to the community and inspired, taught and motivated many young people including my son when he was on the wait staff at a restaurant that Joe used to frequent. Always took time out to single him out and offer words on encourangement and ask how he was going in school.  JD is no different and he and his wife have continued that tradition.  All profits from this Groucho's go back into local charities and not just one specific one.  That said, Groucho's is a chain restaurant headquarted in Columbia SC with a set menu so the question is going to be, how are they any different than other Groucho's.  I've eaten at a number of Groucho's over the years and have occassionally had problems with the quality of either food or service, wrong orders, unfriendly waitstaff or management etc.  Not the case here. A very well trained and motivated staff. Food is alway good, service is prompt and accurate and you feel that you have been made welcome.  One of my favorite sandwichs is the Pastrami on Jewish Rye.  I believe they call their sandwich a Reuben Variation.  Always excellent with a good crisp pickle on the side.  Really show try other items on the menu but this one is so good, it's hard to try something else."}
{"text":"1st trip today and I loved it. I got the Reuben Variations which was wonderful. The corned beef was incredibly flavorful, the tea was a little too sweet for me but easily remedied by mixing with the unsweet tea. I also like that they have several charities and will contribute to the charity of your choice. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Their Roast Beef marinate is real good and flavorful.  The 95 sauce is a must.  Service has always been great.  On a recent time they botched my order (never happened before), but more than made up for it by driving me over the correct order and throwing in some of their amazing salted caramel brownies.  I don't think they even offer delivery, but they were willing to make their customer happy.  I can get pretty grumpy when I'm hungry and I believe it was the owner that took care of me that day."}
{"text":"Stopped here after my kids basketball game for lunch. Service was good but food was not. I was terribly disappointed when I received my sandwich. The turkey reminded me of school lunches. My husband ordered a grilled chicken salad and needless to say it was not good. Everything about the food reminded me of high school."}
{"text":"Table service makes the customer experience unique for a sandwich shop. There's a pretty broad selection of sandwiches and the house dressing is a combination of Thousand Island & Russian - unique but tasty.   Saturday lunch was quick and satisfying and the service was fast. The staff was playing with the music while we were there which became a tad annoying.   Good place for a quick sandwich. We'll go again."}
{"text":"Really fast service! Clean restaurant with friendly staff! Dippers are the way to go with the chips & their special 45 sauce ! So yummy! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've given this place many chances to make my final decision. They have great sandwiches, especially when you compare them to the other places that are close by."}
{"text":"Food isn't great but the proceeds go to charity so it's worth the occasional stop. Club sandwich is pretty good."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff. Cute place, very simple. Super sweet staff, yummy sandwiches. Great lunch go to."}
{"text":"Tried them for the first time yesterday with my two sons.  Service was great.  They wait on you at your table which threw me off since that is unusual for a sandwich shop.  We tried the Mid-East sandwich and it was really tasty.  Our server kept the drink refills coming.  You will pay $6 to $8 a sandwich.  I would go back to try another sandwich on the menu."}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches and great service ... The best thing about this place is that all profits go to charities... Try a turkey or corn beef Reuben ...."}
{"text":"Excellence in community service. They give back to the schools and teachers of Indian Land. Great to have them here!"}
{"text":"No frills. Simple sandwich shop. All the profits benefit charity,which is great. Prices are fair, but the portions could be larger. Needs some more seating to deal with afternoon traffic. Staff was friendly and the atmosphere was clean and organized."}
{"text":"food high. reuben to go 8.31 plus 1.00 tip for taking my order.  equals 9.31 for overrated chain. yeah..sandwich disgusting. can't beat reubens at white horse, rock hill. get wonderful steak fries included. not bag of their brand chips. ha..yelp won't let u leave review without one star to post. Count this place a minus 10."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch after visiting Joe Gibbs Racing. We found out his son owns it and 100% of the proceeds are donated to local charities, so why not?  It's your typical sandwich shop with several choices on the menu. I understand it's a chain, but I've never seen one before so it was new to us. What sets it apart in my book are the dipping sauces. I got the blue cheese one to go with my ham and Swiss and it was phenomenal. The bread was nice and soft and the ham thinly sliced and piled high, like I like it. Hubby had a roast beef deli sandwich on white, which he enjoyed. It was also piled high with beef. The only thing it lacked was cheese. The kid liked his hot dog from the kids' choices (though it looked rather small for the bun it was in).    Chips (plain potato chips, which I guess is all they serve, as we didn't see any choices) and a drink rounded out the meal. The boys got shakes (chocolate and vanilla are the only choices) which were pretty run of the mill.   All in all it was a decent meal served fast. I wouldn't go way out of our way to come here again, but if in the area, we'd go back.  Especially for the charity aspect of it."}
{"text":"Looking for a deli? it's not here. Ice cold (refrigerated) pastrami from cold cut sliced pastrami. Oh and at lunch hour ONE PERSON working the counter to take orders and serve food. So no, not a deli."}
{"text":"Went here with a coworker while in the are for work.  We were craving a tasty salad. I must say the food here is mediocre, nothing special but it did the job. I got the grilled chicken salad with their secret sauce.    This place advertises them-self as a healthy Delhi. It's easy if you're looking for food on the run. Also, they don't serve coffee after a certain hour. He had lunch at about noon and they were out of coffee."}
{"text":"Dipping sauces are off the chain! That is all you need to know, try them!  The sandwich was good but not nearly filling for a fat guy like me, but I liked that it helped me with moderation.  The salted caramel brownie was really yummy.   The best part of course is that the proceeds go to a rotation of charities. It is a true bonus that the food is also really good and the staff is fun."}
{"text":"I work close by and have Groucho's at least once a week. I only get their \"dippers\" which are their specialty. They also offer other good sandwiches and decent salads but the dippers are unique and the real reason to come here. They are basically different meats and soft warm fresh bread with melted cheese on top and come with an awesome \"45\" sauce, which I love.   The service is good and very fast for a table service deli. They usually come check up and get refills for my table several times during each visit.   I don't believe they claim anywhere to be a NY style deli, and they aren't, so don't go in with that expectation. Just get one of the dippers with the sauce and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional. I walked in for a takeout order and the girl behind the counter was friendly and sharp. She gave me some ideas, but I settled with a turkey sandwich on white since it was my first visit. The food was out fast, and I drove home hoping for the best.  It wasn't the best. Instead, it was very plain and boring white bread (should have went with rye) and basically a sandwich you could easily make at home. The pickle spear on the side wasn't bad, but not too fresh, either. The chocolate chip cookie was warm and soft, but there was some funky taste to it. The potato chips were pretty good. Unfortunately, the best part of the meal was the mint.   Not planning on returning with so many other sandwich shop options in the area, but won't rule out a second chance since profits go to charities, and because I appreciate great service."}
{"text":"I ordered a sub.  I got a sandwich.  I wanted hot peppers; didn't have them. Then my sandwich was almost $10!!!   Won't be going back"}
{"text":"Great deli close to Ballantyne area"}
{"text":"New restaurant, so decided to check it out.  I had the Turkey sub, which came out with bologna and salami, swiss, and topped with lettuce and turkey and dressing.  An interesting build, but it works!  My sister ordered mushrooms on her sandwich, and her only complaint is they were the canned kind.  That didnt bother me since I dont mind shrooms.  Overall it was a very good 1st impression."}
{"text":"Have always loved Groucho's food as it was a regularity during my time as a student at USC and again as a resident from 2011-2014. However, the newer location up near Ballantyne left something to be desired: human interaction.  After being directed to grab a table as we dined in, we waited for almost 8 minutes for even an initial drink order.  During this period we watched as a line of to-go orders came and went in addition to 3 other in-house dining parties who sat down after us get served first. This sent me over the edge.  Stood up from table,  explained they needed to work on their customer service game, and walked out.  I know the food is good but I never even stood a chance of getting some water much less a sandwich here."}
{"text":"They have some of the best subs in town! Only complaint is the subs are small for the price you pay. I love that a portion of your order goes to a good cause."}
{"text":"This place is delicious , today on my break I wanted to try something other than the traditional fast food places and this place didn't disappointment at all . Staff are friendly and down to earth and the food is so so good . I treated to the international dip and this was amazing"}
{"text":"We were excited to spot a 4.5 star sandwich place on our way home from Birkdale Village because of course we were looking for something other than Subway.   First of all the location is in a great spot with a rather bright, welcoming atmosphere inside. We were greeted by one of the workers who took our drink order right away.  We decided to order \"The International\" and \"The Cole\".  The cole was just okay, since the bread seemed to take up most of the flavor. I didn't love the accompanied dipping sauce because it tasted a little too mustardy for my palette. The potato salad was made with the same sauce, so I obviously was not a huge fan of that either.   The international- bread was good but it was just kind of bland tasting. The turkey meat was cut thin but didn't have a quality taste to it.  The best part about this place is that many of their proceeds go to charity, they have crushed ice, and the cheese is melted. My favorite part of the meal was the chocolate chip toffee cookie that we decided to split.  Probably will not be back to visit this place, though.  Mostly because we live in the city and there are better alternatives."}
{"text":"My wife and I are USC alums so we had Groucho's in columbia, sc and were thrilled to see one open just down the road from us.  We get the STP sub every time, our favorite and the staff there is incredibly friendly and always gets our order right.  So happy to have Groucho's again, they'd probably be worried if a week went by and we didn't order!"}
{"text":"I ordered ham, salami ( that I had to pay 2.00 extra for) provolone, lettuce, tomato oil and vinegar We also ordered the grilled chicken salad No brainer, not so much The chicken was frozen pre made mystery meat too With a weird mustard base on it  I got fatty ham, some type of mystery meat I don't know it it is their version of salami or it was Bologna??? No lettuce, no tomatoes and it was 1/2 cold a soggy  I do not recommend this place"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing sandwich!! I had the Apollo and it was Dy-no-MITE!! Also, this particular Grouchos is owned by Joe Gibbs of Nascar fame. ALL profits from this restaurant go to charity!! Give them a try. The staff is extremely nice as well!"}
{"text":"The meats are tasty and sliced very thin, almost shaved, the bread is fresh, the sauces are unique and good and the cheeses are so/so (picture swiss that is the texture of american with no holes).  The service is very fast and very friendly and the place is clean.  FInally, what's not to like about 100% of the profits going to one of three charities and the customers get to choose.  Very nice touch!  Groucho's won't be a regular stop for sandwiches as there are better choices in the area but they are good enough to warrant some visits and I applaud them for their philanthropic bent."}
