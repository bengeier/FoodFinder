{"text":"Monday funday with my besties- we walked over to this new spot for a late lunch. 

They let me sample a couple San tan brews before deciding and they offered some great food suggestions.  The 3 of us decided to share the cheese steak, chicken and French toast, and green chili Mac.

The chicken and French toast was my favorite with a crispy golden boneless chicken fried deliciousness over Texas toast.  The syrup brought this dish together nicely!

The cheese steak was amazing with yummy thinly sliced meat and awesome cheese sauce. Fries were a slight upcharge from home made chips.

The Mac was decent but I'd say the other two dishes were better overall.

We will be back to try everything else!"}
{"text":"If you want a break from valley bar and cornish around the corner, come to deli tavern. Menu is not cluttered, and food is executed well. Place wasn't packed when we dined, which was great for us. House-made kettle chips are on the house, with a jalapeno ranch sauce on the side. Hot wings are pleasingly hot with just the right amount of acidity, blue cheese crumbles atop. Will probably skip the shrimp and fries appetizer next time. I ate the cheese steak and tasted the burger and reuben thanks to my company who always lets me eat their food. Pretty good! They're open later some days, which this area could benefit from."}
{"text":"Went here with friends about two weeks ago and it was a wonderful experience. Not only is the menu delicious it brings you back to your childhood filled with comfort food. Definitely recommend the macaroni and cheese, shrimp and fries appetizer, and French toast. Great location as well - look forward to coming again with my girlfriends!"}
{"text":"Bearded, tattooed hipsters who think a good steak could be used to break a window. Harder than Trump getting legislature passed. Toughest, worst steak I have ever had.  I suspect it was USDA select instead of Choice or Prime.  Green Beans were from a can.

Waitress was sweet though. She felt so bad she gave us a \"Whoopie Pie\" Only reason for the 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"Hooray for a new lunch spot! This place is perfect  great service, delicious food, nice atmosphere. I had the French Fried Chicken which is basically an upgraded Chicken & Waffles but with FRENCH TOAST. The chicken was house breaded & fried, amazing!!

My friend has the Grilled Cheese which comes with Tillamook Cheddar, Swiss, and American on Sour Dough - she loved it but thought it could of been grilled just a smidge longer.

Can't wait to come back & try the Green Chili Mac!"}
{"text":"This place is not as it may appear to one on the street!  You walk through the door assuming it to be a quaint deli somewhere to grab a quick bite and it opens to a beautiful elongated eating establishment with a full bar and comfortable surroundings.  We were down to meet some family that was staying downtown and needed to pass the time and were so happy to have stumbled into this place.  We sat down and looked over their menu and everything sounded delicious.  My wife ordered a dessert and I got the reuben with the chips based off the server's recommendation, which I was vary happy I listened to him, they were delicious!  Everything was great, the server could have been more attentive I had to ask for the refills on my drink and they werent busy at all.  If your are looking for a great little place to grab lunch, a quick dinner, or just some drinks check this place out.  They have games put out for the patrons enjoyment which we used they were trivia cards and we had a blast as the time passed.  (and of course I won..lol)"}
{"text":"Great place to eat before the piston v Suns game. Friendly staff.   Great drinks.  Had the turkey and goat cheese wrap with the homemade soup.    Excellent choice.   Definitely will be back the next time I'm in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Pig and Swiss: oh my, one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. No photo because it was eaten too fast. Charlie's turkey was also delicious, lighter more classic taste. Bread was awesome and prices are very fair!"}
{"text":"I would've loved to try their food but I sat at a table by myself for over ten minutes without any service. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Food is ... go for the deli burger, medium with bacon extra crispy and fries extra well done. Ask for Tristan he's the bomb!"}
{"text":"What a great find!   Amazing sandwiches, homemade chips and fries,  and the banana bread... O... M... G!!! 
Ask for Tristan, he's awesome!"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot.  Come here for lunch often.  Everything's good and the bartenders are awesome.  The Out N In Burger and BLT Chop salad are my two goto items.  Do yourself a favor and come here.  Immediately."}
{"text":"\"Perfect martini, a Big Salad, staff who seem to genuinely like that you're there, and, oh, great tunes overhead. Loved it.  Hidden Gem\" is how the bartender described this place to me. Bartender couldn't be more right."}
{"text":"In for the weekend, found on yelp. Great vibe, good music, great service. The food was awesome. Simple menue, easy to read lots of good choices to choose from. Good presentation and the food tasted better than it looked! Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, vintage and welcoming. Food was amazing. Went in with some friends, and started with the smothered browns and shrimp and fries. Both dishes had us all so excited to try more. I had the chicken and goat sandwich and and that did not disappoint at all either. We had the fried banana bread for dessert, and our server basically had to pry it from the table. So. Stinkin. Good. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came for lunch and sat at the bar. Bartender was very nice. Grilled Cheese was yummy and it was ready fast. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Visited the Deli Tavern for the first time and had a fantastic experience! My only gripe is that it isn't closer to my house. #firstworldproblems :-) Fortunately, you can pretty much reach out from the front patio and touch the light rail. It's in a great spot in downtown. Super friendly, attentive service in a place that's more pub than deli, with a warm, welcoming vibe, good drinks, and fab food. Two thumbs up for the Deli burger and homemade chips! And they make their bloody marys with a healthy dose of horseradish, which I really dug. Decor is fun, and you see all walks of life there. It really did just feel welcoming and comfortable and fun. Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I'm in Phoenix from out of town and decided to stop by the Deli Tavern for lunch while I was out and about. I had the green chili mac and my brother had the cheesesteak sandwich. The food was pretty good, but what ruined the visit was the service. I sat there for at least ten minutes with an empty glass and only got a refill when I asked the person that delivered our food. Also, the waitress didn't check back with us until we were done with our meals. I would understand more if they were busy, but there wasn't very many guests in the restaurant at the time. Decent food, poor service."}
{"text":"Quickly, but quietly, Genuine Concepts is extending their reach to levels only Sam Fox and his restaurant concepts have achieved.  You may not know the name Genuine Concepts, but you almost certainly know their brands.  Little Woody, Linger Longer Lounge, The Womack, The Vig, Cobra Arcade, Ladera, The McMillan.  All Genuine Concepts.  Now you can add Deli Tavern to Genuine's portfolio.  Their newest restaurant occupies what was once Downtown Deli from 1969 until it shuttered in 2015.  That was until Genuine's Tucker Woodbury decided to renovate and reopen the former deli as an unpretentious lounge.  Armed with this intel and hungry for an early dinner, I ventured to Deli Tavern on Saturday during happy hour.

Look for Deli Tavern with the old Downtown Deli logo out front on Central just south of Monroe right up against the light rail line.  Much like next door neighbors Cornish Pasty and Valley Bar, Deli Tavern marries a hip urban feel with the character and the bones of an old building (including the old deli floors, btw).  A mix of bar, elevated booth, ground level booth, and outdoor patio seating can comfortably fit upwards of 60-70 patrons with room for up to 100 if you include standing room area around the bar.  Dimly lit and full of wood accents, the Deli Tavern is a quintessential Woodbury design.  The place was surprisingly packed on a Saturday around 4:30pm, but I managed to snag one of the few bar seats available.  

The menu is a mix of bar and comfort food with a little bit of their own spin here and there.  To start off with, I grabbed probably their best selling house cocktail.  The Deli Old Fashioned.  Bulleit Bourbon, AZ Sunshine & Figgy Pudding Bitters, Demerara Syrup, and Roc2 Nitro Cold Brew.  You get a slight hint of the coffee notes on your tongue, but the smoky flavor of the bourbon shines through in this smooth, slightly intense beverage.  I skipped the appetizers this go around and went straight for my main entree.  In this case, the Tavern Steak & Potatoes.  Sliced Grilled Sirloin (medium-rare in my case), onion rings, hash browns, and green bean casserole mixed with a pan jus.  For the most part, I'm a big fan of this dish.  Stick to your ribs goodness that would make for a fantastic late meal after bar hopping or as a delicious lunch recovery from the night before.  My only qualm with this was that the green bean casserole was about 75% mushrooms and 25% beans.  A few mushrooms here and there are fine, but I'm not a big mushroom fan so this casserole was a bit too liberal with the fungus in my opinion.  Lastly for dessert, I had my eye on the dessert that everyone says is Deli Tavern's calling card.  The Bananas & Bread.  It's Deli Tavern's rendition of banana's foster french toast with bananas, an absurd amount of bacon, pecans, and a big dollop of vanilla ice cream on top.  It is indeed glorious, glutenous, and goddamn delicious.  Even though I was full I finished this without hesitation.

Total cost for the drink, the food, tax and tip came to just under $40.  Just an FYI, they do have happy hour specials where you can get a solid meal and drink for under $20.  But as with most places I visit, I go big.  Deli Tavern wouldn't necessarily be the type of place I would goto if I were looking to impress a date or to eat luxuriously.  But if you're out for a night with the boys, a night with the girls, or just generally looking for a late night hangout with friends, Deli Tavern makes for an excellent option.  Good drinks, good hearty comfort food, good vibes.  It's exactly the type of place Tucker Woodbury would dream up.  And a Genuinely Downtown spot (see what I did there?)."}
{"text":"Friendly staff means a lot to me and this place has it! They will take care of you. The Philly cheesesteak is large portion, tender beef and cheesy! The chicken and French toast will not disappoint either! I've only been here a few times since it's newer but each time I've had consistently good food and service!"}
{"text":"Another great addition to the downtown dining/drinking scene!  We stopped in a few weeks ago for drinks and dinner and were really impressed. The place was packed, the atmosphere was lively, the staff was friendly and the food was good.  I enjoyed a glass of New Zealand sauvignon blanc and an egg salad sandwich with fries...simple, but yummy!"}
{"text":"Calling all foodies,! This is comfort food heaven. Savory & sweet. Small cozy bar in the heart of downtown. No parkijng but I'm only a 15 min walk away (gotta burn this stuff off). As for the food, I tried the French Fried Chicken & the Fried PB&J. Muh lord. The pb&j was damn good but it was over far too quickly to really enjoy, nonetheless, the French Fried Chicken was the best thing I've tasted in a long. The French toast is perfectly fluffy, the bacon crispy, the chicken perfectly seasoned, and the bourbon maple syrup  was the perfect combination of savory and sweet. 10/10 would smash"}
{"text":"Bartender was rude and when I got my to go order it was cold, small portioned and over priced."}
{"text":"This place is great! Incredible food and cocktails, wonderful service and staff very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! Simple menu that is delicious. Can't go wrong with the chicken and goat sandwich! I will be back."}
{"text":"The staff here is amazing !  And atmosphere too!   We had the streak dish that was mmmmm just ok definitely overcooked and green bean casserole under cooked.  We Also had the chicken and waffles hold onto your britches this stuff is AMAZING !   I can't wait to come back and try their beef and cheddar sliders.   Had the house made chips and cheese sauce as a snack ...Whoa Nelly!!  Can't wait to come back !"}
{"text":"Go there. Just do it. Have the Pig and Swiss, the Fried Chicken and French Toast, or just enjoy the music, atmosphere, good service, and crispy house chips! You're sure to come out smiling."}
{"text":"This place hasn't been open very long but the service over the weekend was not good. We sat down and were brought some very greasy chips and waited about 5 minutes before we moved to the bar because nobody ever took our order. The bar tender was friendly, maybe to friendly. He did offer to buy our first drink for waiting cause he has many drinks to make still. The place was very busy and they seemed to be under staffed. The bartender was taking to much instead of making drinks. I ordered the hot dog from the menu and it was huge!! Only one problem, it was cold on the inside, like barely cooked. I'm hoping they get their stuff together soon as the location is nice and food options are pretty good. Hoping it gets better with time."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and staff is exceptionally friendly! Love this place for lunch during the week, could eat the BLT Chop salad every single day!"}
{"text":"We stumbled into the Deli Tavern, only to realize that we had been there before. Just like the last time, the food was excellent. I had the Chicken & Goat, a chicken sandwich with goat cheese. It was wonderful.  The service was adequate, though nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"New to the area decided to try this place out based off the reviews, did not disappoint. Food was great and the and drink specials were good as well. Can't go wrong when ordering a burger or sandwich."}
{"text":"Great NEW downtown restaurant! Went with a few colleagues downtown for lunch today and WOW... will definitely be back!

As it literally opened 2 days ago, I was expecting a few hiccups, but this restaurant operated as though it had been around for years! Service was timely and the food was delicious. Two of my dining companions ordered the chicken sandwich (can't remember the name) and raved about it :). Excited to go back and I LOVE that downtown is becoming a food hub.

Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"The pitchers of beer here are really solid on Thursday nights. Under $5 for their house and about $7 for craft. The food was fair, nothing special especially for what downtown deli used to be. Doesn't quite live up to the name on that spectrum. I do love the old fashions here and their strong islands. The service does seem to leave more to be desired. We have had outstanding service and we have had poor service. If they were able to be consistent they would definitely be a destination hangout in downtown for me instead of an aftermeal drink stop."}
{"text":"Work nearby and tried for lunch great sandwiches and the egg salad is to die for.  Went back for dinner the next night working late.  Started with a great AZ ipa, the the house homemade chips(addictive) the the wings (fresh not frozen) and the green Chile Mac.  Fantastic and great portions.  If you are in downtown Phoenix a go too and great service"}
{"text":"What a stellar experience I've had on both my visits to Downtown Deli. My favorite so far as been the beef sliders- the horseradish cheese sauce is to die for! Their house made chips are also killer. I had their Green Chili Mac and it was decent- but I'll definitely try more items before ordering it again. 

The service stands out just as much as the food! Everyone is super friendly, accessible and knowledgeable. Try this place out, seriously!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. The menu is creative and the food is amazing. They have everything from FRENCH TOAST and Waffles to deep fried PB&Js! I didn't get a chance to try either - but I will be back very soon. My girlfriend and I split the Sonoran cheesesteak which was BOMB. 

The service was also great. Isaac, Pete, and Terrel did a great job making my girlfriend and I feel welcome and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with my sister after the movies and were very happy with the quick service, good food, and kind manager. Had a mix-up with the payment and he was very apologetic and sweet. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The food, service, atmosphere, and drinks were all top notch! I highly recommend the Salty Dog for a drink and the Sonoran Cheesesteak for food! I mean, look at the photo... I bet you're already hungry! Definitely check this place out, you won't be disappointed and will be back!"}
{"text":"Looking for a hot new place?? Look no further. Deli Tavern to the rescue and this place did not disappoint. Service was on point and the food was excellent. I would describe it as American Comfort Food, and the drinks were some old school twists on classics. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"I was beginning to wonder if there was ever going to be another restaurant that isn't obsessed with making \"unique\", \"Locally sourced\", \"re-imagined\" crap ever again. I mean, what the F ever happened to just plain good old \"bar food\"? Well, it's gone, but these guys are bringing the old skewl back! This is classic \"bar food\" and I couldn't be happier.

I've had the Shrimp & Fries (twice), burger and fries (once) and pretzel bites (twice). All were solid. You're not going to lose your mind, but you'll be full of solid comfort food, and that's good enough for me!"}
{"text":"This place is good. A bit noisy for a group meeting. Service was okay - had to ask for the check a few times before it was brought to us, making us late to our conference. Other than that, good food for the value, and a little warm in the AZ heat."}
{"text":"Been to the Deli Tavern probably 15 times since it opened in December and tried a wide range of menu items. Service is OK, ambiance is good, but the food...the food is just greasy, buttered, covered in mayo, and frankly, unappetizing. I know the theme is \"east coast deli\" so you have comfort food and things like Reuben sandwiches, green been casserole, buttered buns and such. But it's just heavy and greasy and salty and not that good. Every time I've ordered a burger medium rare it comes out beyond well; every salad is drenched in dressing; every sandwich will give you a week's worth of mayo, grease, and salt. If you're going to eat here, be sure to order mayo on the side or untoasted bread, or you'll be glistening for the rest of the day. Good beer selection and cocktails. I like this place as a 4 or 5 Star bar (although...ChiveTV? Come on, there are real sports on!) but as a restaurant I give it two stars. Mix it together and it's a solid three."}
{"text":"Very deceiving. the waitress Christine said that all our burgers come with a side. we got two Mac and cheese and one egg salad. when the bill came she charged us sepreatly for the sides that supposably came with the burgers. and we had to ask for refills on our waters. I've never been in a place where I had to ask to get a refill of water or anything. Was it a poor choice of words for saying the burgers come with sides, idk but we were still charged for them. the food was good."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Really cool atmosphere, it's in a great location downtown, and it had really good prices! The food was insane! I went with a couple girlfriends and we got a bunch of entrees to share. I can be a picky eater and it was all SO good! My favorites were the sliders, the mac and cheese and the out n in burger.  I definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Old school spot with a breath of fresh air.  The food is so killer!  They renovated this charming little deli downtown, refreshed the entire bar, and make everything from scratch, down to the simplest ingredients - some.of the best comfort food you'll find in downtown Phoenix!  

Try the wings with their signature homemade sauce, the Pig and Swiss with it's unique full taste, or any of the other 30 signature in house creations.  I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a local spot with a diverse, contemporary deli menu.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had a very poor customer service experience tonight, super disappointing. Awesome pitcher specials and good drink selection. Will try not to let tonight sour this place for us."}
{"text":"I went here once before and had a great meal and service. Today, I came in and was seated promptly and then ignored for a full 15 minutes by the whole staff. I watched as everyone else had their orders taken wondering if there was a secret password or button I needed to use. Nobody puts baby in a corner!"}
{"text":"Food is spectacular I mean mind blowing . Service and atmosphere 10+ Isaac hooked us up. You have to give this place a try"}
{"text":"Came into this place last minute after sports tournament for a team and parents and they were great and awesome to accommodate us!! Our server was superb and helpful to put tables together for our large group, great service in trying to separate our  bills for a large group. The food very good for a small tavern in downtown location. It looks like a whole on the wall but food was delicious, did not feel like TGI process food at all! Good food, good seating, great service, what else do you need for last minute group venue!! There was no wait for a Saturday night dinner after 9. Would recommend you guys in a beat for next volleyball team Convention eatery!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in a nicely renovated downtown spot. The servers are friendly and the food is definitely made from scratch. I had the roast beef sliders and they were delicious!

The happy hour menu is stellar for those on a budget. Try it out, you'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Went in today for lunch and was very impressed by the food & service. Don't think that because the name says deli you can only come here for lunch.  There is a full bar & a good amount of beer on tap making this a great dinner spot as well or a good place to meet up for a happy hour after work. 

I had the turkey sandwich, a fantastic choice. Fresh vegetables and turkey piled high on a perfectly toasted multigrain bread. This sandwich could easily be split between 2 people or to have enough for leftovers. 

The chips I got as the side seemed to be homemade and were crisp & delicious. 

The other items on the menu sounded great as well. I will definitely be in again to try out a few of their different offerings."}
{"text":"Cool downtown spot to hang out. Good drink & good selection. The service was ok but not horrible. The decent pricing and good food made up for it."}
{"text":"We stopped in to have a drink, check out the menu and decor. We sat at the bar by the door and waited. The place isn't big and almost all chairs and tables were taken. People already had food and drinks so the bartender wasn't busy but, after waiting for ten minutes and still no acknowledge or eye contact, we left."}
{"text":"The other day, after a conversation with my colleagues before the holidays, I decided to have lunch here. I was SUPER impressed! The atmosphere is great!... not too fancy, not too sports bar-ish, but modern and actually neighborhood jewel. The food; my reuben was DELICIOUS! The coleslaw was OH MY! It tasted like REAL old fashion pastrami I grew up with not that new stuff. Marble rye bread. Homemade potato chips, . A little pricey unlike the deli that I hear that used to be there, but VERY GOOD.  My meal was $15.75 --- the reuben and soda... so not an everyday work lunch spot BUT as a neighbor, it's cool for weekends and guests. My soda was $2.50... maybe that's a bar price,  weird."}
{"text":"If I could give this place higher than five stars, I would! I went yesterday before a wine tasting at valley bar and had a wonderful experience! I ordered a Hendricks/tonic, which was delicious. For food I took a leap of faith and ordered the fried peanut butter and jelly with pickles and omg, it was insanely good! One of the best sandwiches I've ever had! It came with fresh, warm chips that were also great. Will definitely be back for that sandwich ASAP! PS 50 cents for a coffee never hurts!!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this new Deli a try since it received great reviews. It was pretty busy during lunch so I bellied up at the bar. Customer service is great! I ordered the green chili mac and unfortunately it was okay. Nothing too exciting as I was hoping for.
I will be giving this place another try in hopes that their deli sandwiches will win me over."}
{"text":"Okay, the thing is the sand which I got was amazing. So amazing that I cannot see any flaws with this place, other than the seats were dirty.....that coming from a person that doesn't mind a bit o' grime. 

Anyways, the point is def check this spot out."}
{"text":"I just left Downtown Deli and wanted to give them five stars after such a great experience. I walked in on a Saturday night at about nine o'clock and there was a lively crowd. I took the last seat at the bar and was greeted by a friendly bartender. The staff and management was very attentive and checked in often. This is in Stark contrast to most bars downtown on Saturday night... when you're lucky to get the bartenders attention to order a drink. 

The ambiance was casual and comfortable. There were quite a few hipster types and professionals there.   It was a good group and everyone was having a blast. The food was top notch. I had the turkey sandwich with house made chips but the menu was pretty standard bar-deli selections with a unique twist here and there to keep it interesting. They had 10 beers on tap and a small wine and cocktail list but were cranking out everything you could imagine from behind the bar. 

I will be back for the nice ambiance, amazing service and good food soon. Check it out for some drinks and dinner in your travels in Downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've been a few times since it opened and the atmosphere is so fun! Also really great service and food is amazing."}
{"text":"Holly crap the Ruben Sandwich blew my taste buds up !!!! It's so so so so good. My first Ruben ever and I am now addicted. The macaroni and cheese was also perfect. Swallowing was almost sin like since I couldn't taste it anymore. Delicios beer, my favorite. Dark atmosphere, amazing wall art, and games to play at the table. Loved it ."}
