{"text":"Order: Chicken Lo Mein  I always notice that Chicks is super slow. Its hard to compete with Crisp I get that and other solid places like Pho Plus and Clover Joe's seem slow in comparison as well. The lady at the counter is super nice, the place isn't that well decorated but its obviously a take out spot so no big deal. The prices are pretty normal. They got my order quickly. Good signs typically.   The food was not good however. The lo mien tasted way too greasy and was flavorless. The chicken tasted like mystery meat. The smell from when I got the food was just not appetizing. I was able to scarf half of this meal down with the help of ample spicy mustard and soy sauce, but I just couldn't continue.   It was a good experience except for the food, it was just bad."}
{"text":"Great take out spot conveniently located in the Latta Arcade. Never takes more than 5 minutes to get my food even during the lunch rush. Pricing could be a dollar cheaper in my opinion but the bourbon chicken special is fantastic."}
{"text":"Just an update. I have been back many times. The Mac N Cheese is the way to go here. it's amazing! Definitely try this if you are in town for lunch."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE lunch spot downtown. I like EVERYTHING on the menu. As far as lunch downtown goes, they give large portions for the same price you would pay at other restraunts and get less food. They also have a wonderful punch card system where after you buy 7 combo's you get the 8th free."}
{"text":"Tried Chicks for lunch a few weeks ago and was not impressed. The 2 staff working were very friendly, but the fried chicken sandwich is clearly just a frozen fried chicken patty brought back to \"life\" in the deep fryer. It was alright for a quick lunch, but defintely not worth the 4 star yelp ratings that initially convinced me to try it out. I haven't been back since.  I'm pretty sure my high school cafeteria serverd the same fried chicken patty sandwich..."}
{"text":"Meh...below average food, slow service, there are so many better options around..."}
{"text":"I think this might be my fave place in the Latta Arcade. Breaded chicken, good crispy frozen fries and a sweet lil serving you up. The sandwiches are really tasty, but the breasts are kinda small."}
{"text":"I enjoy Chicks if for no other reason than it still serves a chicken salad sandwich that is close to what chik fil a used to do before moving to that way too thick bread they now use. Chick's was started by a fella who used to work for chik fil a so the poultry offerings are pretty similar to what you find there. Fried sandwich, grilled sandwich, etc. Chick's has a greater variety on the menu though in terms of various salads, more side choices...  They also serve breakfast.  Service is friendly but it can sometimes be on the slow side when the line is long. Definitely on the \"grab lunch eat at my desk\" rotation."}
