{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our meal at Abacus Inn this past week. (We had not been there for several years.)  The food was delicious, the service was friendly and attentive, and the prices were very reasonable.  We will definitely go back to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Fast delivery and well prepared food.  This came 30 minutes earlier than expected and each dish treated great"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Thursday afternoon, food was good, service good and portions good for the price.  My daughter ordered her dish special and it came out correct.  Good portions for the price.  Will be back."}
{"text":"The Food, Service and Overall Experience was Delightful. The only criticism I would have is they didn't offer low sodium soy sauce. I'm looking forward to my next visit here."}
{"text":"Wonderful vegetarian options! Veggie chow Mein, tofu with vegetables and the springs rolls are all delicious. Huge portions for good prices."}
{"text":"Egg foo young party is pressed and a little dry. However the gravy is tasty with lots of veggies and meat."}
{"text":"My favorite spot to eat! Great portions AND they deliver! Couldn't be happier with anything I get from them! Chicken chow mein and egg rolls are my go to favorite but I've had lots of stuff in their menu! I highly recommend them to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Great spot. All the traditional favorites and then some. If you like spice try the Volcano Beef, it is awesome. If you like seafood and cream sauce go with the Dragon Phoenix. Abacus Special chicken is great for a fried option. My friends can't get enough of the Sesame Chicken if you like sweet, good stuff."}
{"text":"I had not been to Abacus Inn in several years. I use to work close then was transfered to another area of the city. Anyway, I got a coupon for Abacus Inn from LunchClub.com (a great place for cool discounts, but that is a different story) and remembered how much I loved them. I went and it was as great as I remember. Sun Devil Chicken, a dish with chicken with Jalapanos rule! And having a discount was even better. I will be back now that they are back on my radar. Give them a try. The staff was friendly and made us feel welcome. Go visit them!"}
{"text":"I have had food delivered to me several times from this place. I always get chicken and it's really tasty. I prefer spicy chicken and a brown sauce rather than white. They have great sticky white rice, great crab puffs(8 of them for like 5 bucks and filled with lots of cream cheese and REALLY big) good egg drop but, ask for crispy noodles. I am a great tipper and they arrive faster than anticipated EVERY time."}
{"text":"This is a great Chinese food place - I recommend it.  

There are many different tasty dishes to choose from.  It's operated with good service and modest prices too, so it makes for a great dining experience. ;)"}
{"text":"If you like home made tasting Chinese this place is for you. Comparable price with Panda Express, many times the quality. Hidden gem that has been in the neighborhood for years."}
{"text":"Is everyone else reviewing this place in cahoots with them or what?

I consider myself to be somewhat of a Chinese food connoisseur, so I am always excited to try a new spot. I was staying with a friend in this area, so I ordered from Abacus. First off, I found them to be a tad expensive. I ordered pork fried rice, chicken fried rice, crab puffs and chicken egg foo young with lo mein instead of white rice and it was $40.00!

The rice was bland and the pork was an odd color. The chicken fried rice was also bland. 

The crab puffs were 99.9% warm cream cheese with the tiniest sprinkling of crab essence.... 

Our disgust was in the chicken egg foo young and lo mein. The lo mein came in an individual carton and was just dried noodles. There are no veggies mixed in nor any meat. The egg foo young looked like chicken and veggies in a thin brown sauce. I've ordered this same dish from every Chinese restaurant I've ever eaten in and NEVER has it looked like this. We sent out a search party to locate the egg, the foo or the young but were unsuccessful, so we contacted the delivery company thinking they got the order wrong. After a half hour we received a call to inform us that that was INDEED the chicken egg foo young and that they don't mix the meat into the egg; they just pour it on top. Since I already had it and was unhappy by the presentation, I figured... why not try it and complete the cycle of unhappiness. The taste did not disappoint in that area. Three tiny egg patties sat underneath all of the water chestnuts, thin liquid, chicken, broccoli, and every other vegetable they could throw into this container....


THE BEST THING I ATE WAS THE FORTUNE COOKIE.... I'll never order from them again!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Chinese restaurant in Chandler (Wangs on Ray Rd and Kyrene) closed down over a year ago, and we still haven't found a decent replacement! We have visited Abacus in the past, and decided to give it another try. 

The food was very, very good and the service was actually the best we've ever had in a Chinese restaurant. We also had a vegetarian in the party, and they were very accommodating. 

We ordered one of the family dinners that came with the pu-pu platter (beef sticks were a little on the tough side, but over all everything else was good). Our meal included fried rice, special chicken and beef with broccoli. 

Overall the food was better than we expected and the service far exceeded our expectations.  It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"I am very appreciative that Abacus Inn is within close proximity of me.  As everyone has said, the staff is exceptional.  The food, as one Elite Yelper said, is acceptable.  That is the best description for me.  I am a repeat customer for life.  Thank you, Abacus Inn."}
{"text":"When I am hungry for Chinese take-out, I go to Abacus Inn. Located just west of I-10 on Elliot in the Safeway/Walgreens shopping center, Abacus Inn is convenient to most Ahwatukee residents. I've enjoyed the beef with broccoli, sizzling rice soup, however my favorite is the moo shu pork with plum sauce.  Service is super quick. They are always polite. I often have a half-off coupon for second entree since those coupons are in the mail frequently. Its economical even without."}
{"text":"It is a sad day when you have to say \"goodbye\" to an old friend.  My Family and my parents before me have been going to Abacus for over 30 years. They have catered more than one event for us.  Unfortunately since the beginning of the (so far) short year we have gone twice to eat and both times were less than satisfactory.  The food still tastes the same, but the service has fallen to a very low level.  Our food was cold both times because of timing. They brought it while we were still actively eating our soup (too soon) but it was still cold. The young person did not know how to serve the sizzling rice soup as they did not know how to portion the various ingredients in it, especially the shrimps.    The water glasses were filled by touching the side of the pitcher to the glass thus transferring the saliva of the entire room to each person's glass."}
{"text":"On nights when we have no idea what to eat, Abacus Inn is a go-to. The service is wonderful, and the food is fantastic. The BBQ pork is great as is the orange chicken, mongolian beef, and the special chicken. The sauce they serve with the special chicken is amazing... i wish they sold it by the bottle. :) 
Price is mediocre... we usually spend about $30 and get 2 mains, rice, and BBQ beef."}
{"text":"We decided to try delivery Chinese food for dinner. The lady who took out order was very nice and patient even with the constant phone ringing in the background.  We had the Walnut Shrimp which was delicious but a small order for the price.  The Chicken Chow Mein with crispy noodles, Kung Poa Chicken and Egg Flower soup were good size portions, warm and delicious.  Delivery was said to be 45 min, but we got our order sooner.

For Delivery Chinese food, we'll keep Abacus Inn's phone number for next time."}
{"text":"Well priced, delicious, home-soulful-cooked-and-loved: thats what this place is all about.  

my two friends and i decided to eat here as our first meal after 5 days backpacking in mazatzal mountains. we are vegetarians, and we were accomodated well.  the food + service was truly incredible.

 i absolutely recommend getting the egg foo young.  its  a spherical quiche-like egg dish, with cabbage, veggies, etc., all rolled in a batter and fried up to crispy deliciousness.  so good!

they also have a lunch special (till' 4 o clock): dish + rice + spring roll + tea = $5.50.

try it out.  you will be very pleased with the decision."}
{"text":"Would have been 5 stars but the crazy lady on the pick-up order phone call ruined it a bit.  Didn't matter though as the food rocked.  Decent General chicken, really good Hunan and the Egg Foo Yung was perfect.  Only did dine-in once, mostly to-go.  When we did dine in their tea was very good and the service was adequate."}
{"text":"First attempt at asian cuisine in Phoenix and I thought it was delicious! 

As a vegetarian, i wasnt sure what to expect. but the Family Bean Curd (tofu) dish is perfectly tasteful and spicy.

As some people mentioned, its a pretty low key place. but that means not filled to the brim with loud or annoying patrons, and that means a nice quiet meal can be had!

they also give a complimentary desert when you dine in - some type of very light and crunchy pastry with a banana. best of all, no charge for it. 

went on a saturday and was back there on tuesday, if that says anything."}
{"text":"Consistently good Chinese food. Friendly service and reasonable prices. Pretty standard Chinese offerings. However, the lunch specials are a particularly good value. This is my go to neighborhood spot when I want Chinese. I haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Changed owner?, something happened, not good anymore."}
{"text":"NOT WORTH IT!!!  I was very disappointed with the quality & service.  I had initially requested to have my order delivered, was given a total which did not match up, so  I called them back to say that I'd just pick up my large order instead & was given a $5+ price difference.  I asked them what their delivery fee was, they said $3.00. Hmmm!...Clue #1.  When I picked up the order, I was given another totally different price.  I went ahead & paid for it anyways, but still felt they'd cheated me.  My container had more steamed Brocolli than there was Walnut Shrimp.  That plate was $10.95.  My husband began to eat his dish (Moo Goo Gai Pan) and he said how it tasted like it was cooked with chemicals.  I tried a spoonful and confirmed it.  He ended up puking his guts out about an hour later.  I called to speak to the Manager & they acted like they didn't care about our experience.  I told him that I wasn't expecting a refund but just needed them to hear my concern.  They still didn't care.  It's no wonder why people prefer to go to Buffets."}
{"text":"Had the Kung Pow Two and Shrimp with vegetables. Both were equally delicious. Hot and sour soup was spicy hot and very good. The temperature of everything was very hot. Recommend this place if you hapen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Lo-mein was pretty dry but still enjoyable. The orange chicken and crab angels were amazing. The orange chicken is a balanced combination of sweet and spicy which is just how I like it."}
{"text":"Extremely fast service food was out quick and fresh! Would most likely come back soon! Recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"I loooooove this place!!! Service is nice and we always walk right in. Beef and broccoli is amazing as is their crab puffs and orange chicken. Hot and delicious everytime."}
{"text":"Bland, boring, uninteresting typical American Chinese food. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Umm.. honestly it reminds me of a place I grew up going to. The fried bananas were such a surprise as a dessert. Literally cost $16 for two lunches on a friday.
Jenny is super nice and so is everyone there. Thanks so much for the food coma. Way too much way to cheap. See you next Friday"}
{"text":"* Plates of won tons sitting at every table for who knows how long and I-Hop style syrup containers full of sweet & sour sauce.

* Packed lunch room of clientele all Boca Raton-early bird special style.  

* Gnarliest egg roll that ever egg rolled which was part of an otherwise unmemorable lunch special. 

* Paul McCartney's \"Wonderful Christmas Time\" playing overhead. TWICE. I hate this song more than any other. Of any genre. Ever. I'd rather listen to dogs barking \"Jingle Bells.\" Or a country song.

* However, + 1 extra star for fast, friendly service.

Meh."}
{"text":"Big fan of Abacus.  The service can be slow but the food is so worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Sunday. I was surprised that their lunch menu was everyday. I ordered kung pao chicken from the lunch menu that came with egg drop soup, spring roll, rice, and wontons. Everything was tasty and the service was very good."}
{"text":"I've been here many times as we live in the area. Nothing here will really knock you out, but I do like their Walnut Shrimp. Ask for it with a light amount of sauce, otherwise it's absolutely slathered.
The service is always friendly, but many times we order something like an appetizer or won tons that simply never arrives. Oh well, it's become a running joke- will we get it or not?
Overall a decent place."}
{"text":"Where to begin.... I ordered the salt calamari, the abacus chicken, and the house noodles. The noodles were gooey and the goo got on the shrimp, the broccoli, and the chicken so everything was gross and had a gross gooey film on it, the calamari was over cooked and extremely chewy, and the abacus chicken was extremely dry. I will NOT be ordering from this place again.

Oh wait there was a plus, delivery was quick, maybe because the food was already made when I ordered it... at least thats what it tasted like.

Smh...."}
{"text":"Four Words: \"Good Enough Chinese Food\"

Order here whenever the in-laws are in town since there are no Chinese food places that delivery in the small town they live in.

I am never upset with the quality."}
{"text":"Lured by the Phoenix Magazine claim that Abacus Inn boasts the Best General Tso's Chicken, it was worth investigating. The restaurant is traditional, service is kind and fast and prices are low. Best General Tso's Chicken? It's no match to the now defunct Jasmine Tea House in my hometown... but it's less sweet, red and sticky that what you find everywhere else. That, in my opinion, is a good start."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this place. We were quoted a 45 minute wait, but the food was delivered within 25 minutes, AND the delivery driver was kind. I like! 

The crab puffs were great. 
The eggrolls were delicious. 
The Mongolian beef was tasty and plentiful (especially with added mushrooms and broccoli). 
The sesame chicken was \"ok\", it was soggy due to the overload of sauce. 

They do combine everyone's rice in one to-go plate, which we didn't like. We ordered individual plates, not a family meal deal. Also, they don't have sriracha sauce!!! Bummer!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for Chinese take out. The crab puffs are a must!!! When we went in to eat, we were treated so well! It is authentic and I have not had anything on the menu the menu that I didn't love."}
{"text":"I literally live 2 mins from this place. He took my address when I called, he started taking my order, then when I wanted to add vegetable friend rice, he interrupted me and said he couldn't deliver. VERY RUDE!  I just moved here, never again! This is NOT how you treat customers."}
{"text":"I have a very difficult time finding decent Chinese food here in the valley. Abacus Inn is probably one of our favorites right now. We've only ordered delivery the food shows up fast and is always hot and fresh nothing I can complain about."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Ordered take out and it took over an hour to get the food when in was told 15 minutes. I get to the store to not be greeted or anything. The 'host' was checking on her split ends and on her cell phone. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food! Dinner expensive but worth it. Lunch specials ridiculous. So much food always have leftovers. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner last Friday evening at Abacus Inn Chinese Restaurant located in a set-back plaza at the southwest corner of 35th Ave and W Thunderbird Rd in Phoenix, AZ.

We started with our favorite - Hot and Sour Soup, at which we were very pleasantly surprised. Just the right combination of \"flavor\", \"hot\", \"sour\", and content. We both agreed this hot-n-sour soup is in the top two or three we've had. Onto the egg rolls. Once again, very pleasing flavor. Our entrees we chose that evening were Kung Pao Chicken and General Tso Chicken. The KPC exceeded our expectations being quite tasty with plenty of sauce. The GTC was not as sweet as we tend to like, but was still good.

The decor was decent, and was typical for Chinese restaurants - comfortable, appropriate lighting. Plenty of parking. Good prices."}
{"text":"One word comes to mind....ish. Ordered the Pu Pu platter, don't bother, way too much money, no dipping sauce,(unless you ask) and the shrimp, well I have no I idea what was in that formation...I ordered a beef dish that was so dry I had to dump chili paste and soy sauce on it to wash it down with the overly dry rice. My friend ordered the sweet and sour chicken, same thing ,very little sauce.I will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service!  I had a dinner special of pork egg foo young: came with a crab puff, egg roll, fried rice, steamed veggies and hot tea... The egg foo young was smothered in sweet and savory gravy and topped with sprouts, water chestnuts, and veggies.  All for 10.81 including tax!  

I recommend this place and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese food. I would have never come here if it wasn't for the reviews and I'm not disappointed. Wife and I ordered the Abacus special which came with sizzling rice soup, PU PU platter, and 3 entrees. The meal was great and had to take home a lot of food. Wife wants to try one of the other combo meals next. BTW the customer service was amazing and friendly."}
{"text":"Is this the best food I've ever had in Phoenix?  Why yes, I think it is.  If I lived in Phoenix, I'm sure I'd be giving out five stars in a heartbeat.  I don't, though, I live in Portland.  And I sincerely apologize to Phoenicians, but I've had a long streak of bad food from your city . . . well, your state.  Abacus was a huge exception.

Correctly priced, excellent service and wonderful food, don't pass up this place for Chinese food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Not a fan the food . The ownership changed and things are different . Wish they kept the old recipes"}
{"text":"The lunch price is a few dollars less and you get more food! I can go for lunch, fill up on the won tons, soup, and tea and then pretty much take my entire entree home for dinner. One of my favorite places to get Hot & Sour Soup. I always order the Sun Devil Chicken, which is (not breaded) chicken and jalapenos in a yummy sauce. To add a bit more flavor, I add vegetables. DELISH!  Also, the placemat with the Chinese Horoscope is classic!"}
{"text":"Love the food! Good portions ; nice atmosphere. Good place to relax & not feel rushed. 1st choice for us"}
{"text":"Seriously unimpressed. Ordered delivery from here last night. Lots of food, but not much flavor. I had orange chicken.. One slice of orange in the whole order and not much orange flavor (or any other either). Hubby had Szechuan Chicken. It had a very strong onion flavor - but not much other flavor. We also ordered Pot Stickers. They were big, but again - not very flavorful.

All in all, not worth the wait or the money. I guess it would do in a pinch, but not if I had any other options."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here if I could give it zero stars I would first of all we ordered an egg roll appetizer it came out in two minutes and it taste like it'd been refried now I've had refried beans that I never had refried eggrolls. Everything just went downhill from there my daughter had the house fried rice it has all of three shrimp in it and it was tasteless. I had the shrimp in garlic sauce it was also tasteless and I tasted no garlic I guess they forgot to put it in needless to say we wont be back to this damn place."}
{"text":"This place is great. The egg flower soup is wonderful; rich, thick and exactly what I crave when I'm sick. They're English is shaky but props to them since its not like I speak any Chinese dialects. I have a food allergy and these folks try really hard to be accommodating. 

Order the shrimp in lobster sauce. The portions are large and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Always delivers so fast and the food is great! Recommend the Kung Pao and Crab Puffs!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  The food is so fresh and delicious and they deliver!!  I am lucky enough to be within their delivery zone and I crave it!  My favorite is the walnut shrimp, but their crab puffs are very good too!  I have never been disappointed and have tried numerous different menu items.  They are friendly and fast, I highly recommend Abacus Inn!!"}
{"text":"The portions are so big.  I can't even begin to tell you how much grub you'll end up getting if you go for one of those \"dinner for two\" options on the menu.  I think my date and I could only manage to finish half of the food.  Speaking of, the food itself is pretty good.  This isn't the best chinese meal you'll have, but it beats out nearly any take-out place you were thinking of ordering from.

The service is usually good, but can get pretty weird.  One time, I asked for a refill of my soda to which my waitress tersely replied, \"no.\"  Not \"we don't have free refills.\"  No choice to pay for another.  Just a simple decline.  I stuck with water at that point because, frankly, I was too intimidated by this old woman to press the issue.  Such is life!"}
{"text":"I use to love this place. But now that I am a vegetarian they don't have a lot of meatless options. They only make pork spring rolls and egg rolls. Which sucks because those are my favorites. Also most there dishes is swimming in sauce or gravy or whatever you want to call it. I don't like that. Still good, not bad just not a 5 stars. I will give it another shot. Thank yoi"}
{"text":"I'm not super impressed. I paid the extra 3 bucks for shrimp and scallops. Maybe 2 scallops that were halved, a few more shrimp than that. Meh. It tasted alright, but why did I pay extra for not a whole lot more than veggies? Also, I outrightly asked if there was cream cheese in the wontons. I'm a fan what can I say and there was no cream cheese in the wontons. 5 more bucks down the drain for something that I won't even bother with. When I ask you a question and you say yes there is, the product should reflect that. The guy taking my order seemed very disinterested as well. 3 stars is charity. Again, I was not that impressed. I'm trying different things in the area so it is what it is."}
{"text":"I had a really nice experience eating at Abacus Inn tonight. 

The place is small and unassuming in a little strip mall.  If you weren't looking for it, you'd never see it.  The staff was all very friendly.  I'm in town on business, so I was dining for one.  I asked to sit at the bar, and they obliged.  

Kudos for having a full bar and Tsingtao! 

First, let me warn you.  If you order the wonton soup, it is ENORMOUS.  I can't quite describe how huge this bowl was.  To put it into perspective, they brought me a ladle and a smaller bowl to put the soup in.  It was enough soup for a family of four easily.  I felt bad, because I couldn't even make a dent in it, and since I'm staying in a hotel without a fridge, I had no way to keep the leftovers.  Just be prepared - this is not an appetizer.  This soup could feed an army.

Having said that, the soup was yummy.  It had big wontons in it, chicken, shrimp and lots of fresh vegetables.  

For my main course, I ordered the black pepper chicken.  It was very spicy, but very good.  Really heavy on the black pepper, but hey, that's what it's called.  It was nothing mind blowing, and I've certainly had better Chinese.  I was a little disappointed that the mushrooms they used in the dish appeared to be canned mushrooms (like the ones you get on pizza) as opposed to fresh mushrooms.  

Four stars for super friendly service, great prices and yummy (but not particularly special) food."}
{"text":"I have not been to this place for many years. Three of us dined here on a Saturday night. Only two other tables were populated at 5:30pm. I liked it, but did not love it. Ordered the Thai Volcano Beef, a couple of egg rolls and the Hot n Sour soup. I expected it to be hot, but it was greatly lacking in heat. Tasted just OK. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"We order from here a lot and never have been disappointed! I thinks it's one of the best Chinese places around phoenix. And they are supper fast and really good prices."}
{"text":"I have visited this place many times over the last few years and have reviewed it highly but yesterday, after a six month absence, I found it to be less than it used to be.
First a man came for our drink order.  I ordered hot tea.  Then I asked what kind of hot tea he served (green, black, jasmine, hibiscus?)  He simply didn't know beyond \"hot tea\".  Finally settled on iced tea to simplify things.
I ordered mongolean beef and my friend ordered sweet and sour pork.  The soup came without any crispy noodles.  Had to ask for them.  Then came the main course.  We both thought our meals were very heavy in sugar. Rest of the meal (dessert) was standard.
Is this restaurant under new management?  Did everyone who normally works there (cooks) go on vacation?  
To be honest, at 12:30 in the afternoon when we arrived there were a lot of customers.  I hope their food had less sugar than ours did.
Will probably try again for \"old times sake\" and to see if the food will be better next time.  If not, I won't be back"}
{"text":"During my search for amazing Chinese delivery in my new neighborhood, I came across Abacus. I was hopeful that it wouldn't be like the two other place I had already tried. Thank goodness it wasn't!

We had the Orange Beef, House Special Chicken, Chicken Chow Mien, and Crab Puffs. All of it was delish. They have some really full and tasty crab puffs!! My fav so far that I've ever had!!

One thing I would like to point out is when the deliver, they put the sauce in the side in a cup. Amazing!! It keeps the crispness of the deep fried goodness crunchy and not soggy. You can then use as much or as little sauce as desired! Genius!!!!

Their rice however just wasn't the sticky goodness rice that I prefer. It was more like jasmine long kernel rice. This knocked the score down just one star. I will for sure order again!"}
{"text":"YUM!! Very happy with this place. Now a days it's hard to find good Chinese places that don't make you sick, or are a chain and have the same generic flavors. This place was amazing. Service was great, very polite and attentive. Food came out fast, and serving sizes were huge!!!! I will definitely return many times!"}
{"text":"Cuz when it's dinner time and noone wants to cook and noone wants pizza delivery and we mostly crave hot soup and noodles.

Can't say it's the best hole in the wall Chinese food but it certainly hit the spot.The servers did a good job putting up with our entire table. All our bumbling back and forth about who wants want and who's sharing this and that. They were so patient. The dishes were good, they came out piping hot and fresh. And kept that hot tea pouring. The sizzle of rice in my soup was my favorite part. 

Yeah, I'd say that Abacus is a solid choice for your takeout special; affordable and tasty."}
{"text":"Happened to be in the area for a doctor's appointment and bought about 5 entrees and some eggrolls.  They make their own eggrolls, but they weren't that good.  I had to use the facilities and they were in bad shape so that should have told me something.  The beef in the beef broccoli was average and the broccoli was mushy.  The sweet & sour chicken was average.  The Abacus fried rice had pork, chicken & shrimp in it, but the chicken was rubbery and dry.  Where are the really GOOD Chinese restaurants in Phoenix hiding?"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed. General Tso chicken was not General Tso it was Kung Pao Chicken. They didn't bother to tell me they switched it or anything. Just thought I am dumb and I wouldn't know. Pu pu platter food was over cooked and dry. Crab puffs were over fried/cooked as well as the egg rolls. Wasted $50 on food and am angry that I wasted time driving from Laveen to Thunderbird and 35th Avenue. Disappointed and will not be returning. I doubt the owner cares but tomorrow I am going to make a phone call and I expect a refund and/or credit."}
{"text":"I found a baby roach at the bottom of the box underneath all my sesame chicken yestsrday, not ordering from here again. 
Disgusting."}
{"text":"First time I have eaten here, it was great. We had it delivered. We were told 45 min for delivery time but food was here within 20 minutes.  It was delicious! We will be eating here again."}
{"text":"First time here and I had the Moo Shu Pork. It was really good! Crab puffs were a good deal and tasty as well. I would return."}
{"text":"Seriously, most amazing Egg Drop Soup Ever!!!  Fast service, reasonably priced, very clean and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wow, wow it reminded me of NYC Chinese food.  The fried noodles on the table, yummy egg drop soup. The soup was flavorful and not gummy. I ordered the Abacus chicken which was very tasty. My husband had the sweet and sour chicken. He was silent the whole time, a very good sign. :-D The staff was prompt and friendly. We will stop here again when we are in Phoenix. If you're a local and haven't eaten here yet, what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"This was are great dinner service was out standing. Very clean inside will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I have lived three blocks down from this place for 18 years and never stopped in. A friend of mine has been going there for about five years while attending college she took us in there one day and it was the best food we've ever had. The service is awesome they are quick and very friendly.if you're lucky and you get the honey coated banana wontons that is the best dessert possible"}
{"text":"Great Chinese restaurant for take-out. I had the crab rangoon, sizzling rice soup, and honey glazed chicken. This was easily enough food for two. The employees are very friendly and eager to assist."}
{"text":"I just found my new home. If I could only bathe in the orange chicken sauce my life would be complete!! Ordered orange chicken, shrimp fried rice, house fried rice, and crab puffs.  Everything was so fresh and flavorful.  If you are looking for the best Chinese food in NW Phoenix, this is it!"}
{"text":"This place was SO awesome in every way!! Our first time there and so glad we gave it a shot finally. Peter was a fantastic waiter! We'll definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"First time customer last week ordered delivery. I ordered the Abacus Chicken, and my wife ordered lettuce wraps and veggie fried rice. The food was delicious. Our second order last night we ordered General TSO's Chicken, Crab Puffs, Spring Rolls, and Veggie Fried Rice. Again very impressed with how amazing the food is. 

We will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Horrible delivery service. I ordered sesame and orange chicken combo for dinner with friends and the guy told me an hour wait. An hour passed and I call them back and the lady that answered said the food hadn't even left the store. Never trying here again."}
{"text":"Went in last weekend, we ordered the orange chicken and thai volcano beef. We loved it, the service was great! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I found my new favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley.

What a surprise this place is. I went to Abacus Inn after reading all the good reviews and Abacus lives up to expectations.  I think it's safe to say I've found my new favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley.  ABACUS INN is simply delicious! 

 The Mongolian beef was to DIE FOR.  The Mongolian Beef was tender and seasoned perfectly. The portions are huge, I was full after the appetizers as was my lunch companion, so I took a lot of food home, and it tasted great the next day. 

Abacus Inn is reasonably priced, friendly staff, excellent food, and very generous portions.  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive.  I especially appreciated that she boxed up the leftovers instead of just dropping off some boxes at the table. 

Now that I found this gem, I'll be sure to go back.  If you haven't tried it, go...NOW."}
{"text":"Delicious Kung Pao Chicken! Restaurant was clean. Service was fast and friendly! Will visit again!"}
{"text":"I ordered from here last weekend and so far so good.  I ordered two things and the volume of food was so much that I actually didn't run out until last night.  To me that's pretty impressive to order something and be able to make it stretch for dinner every night of the week for 6 days straight.  Considering the volume I'd say the price wasn't bad either.

They accept credit cards and delivery was pretty speedy.  They told me by phone 45 minutes and actually were there within 25 minutes.  So sooner than I thought it would be.

I'd say I'm going to order here again for sure."}
{"text":"My hubs family has been coming here for decades and I've been coming here for with them for 18 years. This restaurant is a staple to this community for sure! It's tucked away in a strip mall plaza and is easily missed if you're not looking for it. And, like Dr. Who's tardis, it's bigger on the inside. 

The food is great, they offer a wide variety of options and you have to try their pupu platter. It comes loaded with delicious appetizers and a little grill to cook your meat strips right at your table. We always get one when we come as well the hot and sour soup - it's really the best there is! 

The house chow mein and the house special chicken are amazing - give them a try and you won't be disappointed.  Really, everything on the menu will give your taste buds a chance to do a happy dance in your mouth. 

The service is fast and friendly too - and if you're in the area, the lunch specials are a great deal!

Now, with all this being said, the restaurant is old and while they've done some upgrades to the seats and chairs, the decor and style harkens back to the late 80s. Don't let that stop you once you walk thru the doors, the visit will be worth it!"}
{"text":"Coming from Seattle and being used to a completely different style of Chinese food, this place was acceptable.

The service was quick, they didn't mind the 3 of us sitting at a table for a while, and the food was ok.  It's one of the better places I've had Chinese food in Phoenix and would definitely go back.

I had the Mongolian Beef and it was quite bland, but good nonetheless.  I'd definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Went to this place as I work close by and the food was fresh but had no taste at all, same with my dinner partner we both felt there was no flavor and little attention paid to that detail.  We also waited a long time to get our food despite the lack of customers, our waitress did not speak English and couldn't take a cocktail order, did not know what a full bar was or recognize the word WISKEY.  The best part was the triangle dessert made from lychee paste and won-ton, drizzled with carmel or sugar syrup, that was actually great.  Won't go back. 
Would rather go to Thunderbird Roadhouse in the same plaza, totally different food but it has flavor and is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The concierge at our hotel recommended Abacus Inn. It was such a great suggestion.  We had the crab puffs, almond chicken, and the general tsao's chicken.  Fantastic!  After dinner, they brought use this sweet banana fried dessert.  If you like good Chinese food, definitely make time for this place!"}
{"text":"So I just tried to order food and the guy who answered told me my address was wrong and hung up. So I guess I will never know how good the food is lol. If you can't hear me at least have a little patience the call did not last more then 20 seconds lol."}
{"text":"Well, I had high hopes. I LOVE asian food and am hard pressed to find anything nearby that's decent. Decided to try for delivery so I didn't have to take my two girls out of car seats to pick up food. Ordered online and chose delivery for 6 PM. Got a phone call saying that the person who took the order from there online area didn't notice that I wanted it for 6 PM. Would it be OK if it came now. It was 4:45 PM. I said it was fine and rolled with the punches although it was an hour ahead of when we were planning on eating.  Got nothing but an apology and early food.

Brought the box of food inside from the delivery driver. Everything had been tipped sideways at some point. Sauce had dripped down all over everything. The spicy dish was on top which means the spicy sauce leaked onto the teriyaki chicken as well as the rice container. I didn't even bother trying to open the rice.

The food was at best mediocre. BBQ pork was very dry. Beef with Thai sauce was gummy and there were no jalapeños. My kids liked the teriyaki chicken but they are 2 and 5. I didn't even keep leftovers. Unfortunately, still looking for a good Chinese place."}
{"text":"Son has been getting it for years.  I finally joined him and then got husband to try.
Now we order weekly. The service is always quick, great portion size AND the food is AAAAAMAZING!!!!"}
{"text":"Brought the wife and kids on a Saturday evening and enjoyed the experience. Lots to eat and out the door with a tip for $50.00. Enjoyed all our dishes of standard Chinese fare. I was able to order Chow Fun noodles  ( wide rice noodle ) on their house special noodle dish and that made me happy. The service was excellent and our seating was confortable. We will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delicious and everyone is very nice and super attentive. Their egg drop soup is the best. New favorite."}
{"text":"Killer lunch specials that are hard to beat... always coupons in local papers and clipits for dinners as well.

I've been to Abacus about 8 times now and have failed to leave a review for them so here's the breakdown.

Food is good... probably not the best I've ever had but definitely nothing wrong with any of the meals I've had there, and I've never eaten the same thing twice as I've been trying to eat different things each time.  Their menu is pretty big and can get a little confusing for somebody with ADD like me but hey you get a lot of good stuff to choose from.

Service is always very prompt and they're very nice as well.

Cost is average, but like I said, get the coupons from local papers... 

All in all, I like Abacus and I'll continue to frequent there when I'm in my chinese food moods :)"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here, and it was surprisingly good although not the fastest delivery (Friday night). The lo mein was tasty and my sizzling rice chicken was very flavorful, although more sweet than I would have expected. Actually tasted better the second day, too."}
{"text":"Decent place.  I ordered delivery tonight because it's very close to my home and we didn't feel like cooking.

I'm a pretty harsh reviewer so don't be alarmed that it wasn't given 4/5 stars.  I'm not a big consumer of Chinese food, but I know what I like.  I don't even think PF Changs deserves 3 stars.  I'd take a quick lunch at China Chili over them any day of the week for your reference.

The menu was decent enough.  Most of the same dishes you see everywhere else, plus a couple that aren't as mainstream as your basic 10 item take out joint.

OK so to the food.  We ordered the Shrimp and Cream Sauce, Orange Chicken, and an order of the Crab Puffs.  Portions are more than generous.  The Shrimp with Cream Sauce was um, interesting.  The shrimp were large, well cooked, and there was a decent amount of them for the price.  I prefer spicy dishes so it was a little on the bland side for my tastes.  On it's own the dish was not what I would consider Chinese.  It was more like an attempt at a crustless shrimp pot pie than an Asian inspired meal.  A few shots of Sriracha helped a bit.  Probably wouldn't get that one again just for that.  It was ok, just not what I expected.

The Orange Chicken was what you would normally think of from a place like this.  Breaded chicken with a sweet sauce.  However, the breading was light and crisp, the chicken was tender, not dry at all, and the flavor was really good.  Could easily get 2 meals out of this dish as well.

Crab Puffs were exactly what you would expect from an average Chinese spot.  Fried wontons filled with cream cheese and a few tiny bits of imitation crab.  I will say that there is a decent sized plop of the cheese mixture, and they were crunchy and not too greasy.  Again the portion size (8 per order) was much more than I have seen at other places.

I will order from here again. Just keep in mind that I wrote this considering it as a Chinese delivery option, and it was a good bit better than many I have tried.

 Large portions, arrived in a reasonable amount of time, and got here hot and crispy.  Good value and decent food."}
{"text":"Love this place, went in this past weekend. Great food and great service. Their orange chicken is soooo good! And they deliver too!"}
{"text":"Worst service and food ever since new owner took over. Asked to be move cuz it was too cold. Waited over 15 minutes, nothing done. Kept clearing tables of customer who had already left instead of attend new customer. Plenty of tables that we're cleaned to move to. We basically got up, and they suggested to move to one warmer area. Then when ordering, wanted a cocktail which was on the menu, never being told ahead of time, they hadn't receive their liquor license prior to being asked for our order. Food was bland,  used to get soup and rice, but was extra charge now."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for lunch on and off for years!  I love the Abacus chicken special, #8 on the lunch menu.  YUMMY!  The lunch is super fast, super good, and a reasonable price.  It comes with soup (egg drop or hot and sour soup), you get fried wonton chips, your meal includes 1 egg roll, 1 fried wonton, fried rice, and your selection.  I have never tried anything else off the menu.  Abacus chicken - I am hooked!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food!  We love Abacus Inn.  We usually do take out. When we have dined in the service has been great!  Our favorites are the Egg Rolls, Sweet and Sour Chicken and Crab Wontons.  I would recommend Abacus Inn to anyone in search of good Chinese food."}
{"text":"the springroll was good for something with all veggies, but that's about the only good thing. the thai volcano beef that I ordered was WAY too salty and not spicy at all. After I left the money on the table, the boss or whoever thought I was trying to walk off without paying and stopped me. Really now?? I'm trying to walk off on a bill for $9?? Talk about bad customer service. another badly managed chinese restaurant that can't cook. Never coming back again"}
{"text":"My husband only eats this beef broccoli. The service is fast and take out is great. They also deliver but I unfortunately live too far away. Love the honey banana won ton served at the end. Good food at a great price."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place so many times but finally, late on a Saturday afternoon circumstances of time, hunger, and location came together and I finally stopped in to eat.  At 4 o'clock I took advantage of the very affordable lunch menu which is served up until 4:50 p.m. I had the house special chicken which came with rice, 1 egg roll, 1 crispy wonton, and a hot n sour soup.  Both the chicken and the rice were moist and not dry and the portions generous.  Mind you at the slightly odd our of 4 p.m., there were only a few other people in the dining room, but service was polite and attentive and my water glass never went dry for more than a minute or so.  I don't know how to describe the house special chicken except to say as above that the portion was large and that it was good, if unexceptional.  The hot and sour soup felt a slightly odd choice (to me) given yet another 106 degree September day outside, but I love hot n sour and within the comfortable air conditioned confines of the neatly kept dining room it was as perfectly balanced  as I've had anywhere (aka not overly vinegary), and thoroughly enjoyed. The vegetable stuffed eggroll was perfectly fine, crispy outside and pleasant cabbage etc., in the middle.  The single crispy wonton didn't seem to add anything but it didn't detract, so I'm willing to let it live another day.  Lord knows I didn't leave hungry.  All that and under $8 with tax (lunch menu).

I enjoyed my meal and will go back to try more from this pleasant, affordable, family-run Chinese restaurant on the south side of the shopping strip that also hosts the Big Lots store on the SW corner of Thunderbird and 35th Avenue.  

Decent food, good service, sizable portions not skimpy on the meat, and very affordable."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times for celebrations. Like the fact thay you can bring your own cake to light and eat for birthdays. They also have great customer service. 

Rated 3 stars for the food. Love the crab puffs and walnut shrimp but they have small servings for those. Their house chow mien is also good. Everything else was a hit and miss for me. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always hot and fresh. Me and my family love the wontons and sesame chicken. Fast to go service. We will always come back for more as long as we live in this area."}
{"text":"I'm not a Chinese food buff by any means... heck, this was my first experience at a sit-down Chinese food place. :) We went in and were promptly greeted and shown to our booth, the service was more than attentive, cleaning plates from the table as the last bite was still in my mouth... okay, maybe that's TOO attentive. ha

We tried the crab puffs for an appetizer, and again it was my first experience with crab puffs, but it seemed like there was barely any crab inside the puff. But, what do I know... maybe that's normal? They were tasty though... especially with the sweet sauce that accompanies it. For my entree, I had the chicken and broccoli. The serving was plentiful- way more than I should have eaten in one sitting... but I managed. Hey, I was really hungry when we walked in. :) 

And, as an added bonus, I did confirm the fact that Abacus Chinese Restaurant does have an actual abacus on site. It's up front by the register. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Use to have good food, it was one of my favorite places to eat. Got takeout a couple days ago and was not good at all.  We ordered 4 different things and none of them were good.  Thought I would give it another chance and tried to warm up the lots of leftovers we had  will not be eating them.   Will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Abacus Inn is my absolute favorite Chinese food place! The staff is always extremely friendly and try their best to make sure the guests are always satisfied with their meals. 

Their lunch specials are amazing, also. You get your choice of a soup and an entree for a VERY fair price. Or in other words, I recommend going for lunch instead of for dinner. Always call for the times of the special, though, as they might have changed."}
{"text":"Our fave local take out/dine in Chinese Restaurant for many years....Please try the Orange Beef and the BBQ Pork & Snow Pea.   Excellent service in house, terrific value of food for your dollar.    \"Dessert\" of banana honey wonton free with every meal in addition to fortune cookie.   Clean, courteous, good food and great value. What more can you say?"}
{"text":"Entrees we amazing were amazing. The fried rice was mediocre. I'm used to having my fried rice with little bits of carrots and peas.... Service was awesome. The little Asian lady was SO nice and accommodating. Very conversational. This is probably my new fav for Chinese."}
{"text":"Delivery: Ordered four times now and while it's not earth shattering Americanized Chinese food. It's been well packed,hot,and on time. Yes some of the sauces, specially the Kung pao are  bland but the hot and sour soup, thankfully,doesn't fall into that group.  really a  2.5  raised to a 3."}
{"text":"Their lunch special is a great value!  Soup, chip things, good portions and a dessert.  But if you do nothing else order the crab poofs!  They are freaking amazing, you will never have them anywhere else as good as this."}
{"text":"Abacus Inn has been serving excellent authentic Sczchuan Chinese lunch specials for years. They offer a wide selection of lunch specials that range from $6.95-7.95 for every taste. 

They offer lunch specials every day from 11am-4pm, which is amazing because most only offer specials during the week.  Specials come with either egg drop or hot and sour soup, won tons, an egg roll, and rice. You can order brown rice for $1. 

I recommend the orange chicken or General Tso's chicken. Both are a little more spicy. 

Iris was our server this week and she was one of the more friendly and helpful people I've met in a long time. 

I've never been disappointed with the food quality or service."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this restaurant for many, many years and I have never had a bad meal. It is family-owned and all of the staff are very nice and friendly and they will remember you if you go often. The lunch meals that they are offer are an amazing value, you get soup, fried rice, your choice of entree, and a spring roll or egg roll.

I recommend the kung pao chicken or shrimp, the beef with broccoli, mushu pork, sun devil chicken, and the hot and sour soup. But you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Very cheap food with amazing flavor the staff is always nice and inviting."}
{"text":"I guess I was the fourth person to make the mistake of getting this confused with the Abacus Inn on 48th St & Elliot.  No big deal, glad I tried a new place.

We ordered your usual type of chinese foods.. mongolian beef, chicken chow mein, some soup, etc. 

Felt bad because when the waiter was walking our food to the table he somehow slipped and the entire tray of food tumbled to the ground and he burnt himself in the process.  He apologized at least a dozen times, in which we were just making sure he was ok.  They cleaned up the mess and we enjoyed a very delicious, stuffing meal. 

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here since 1987!  Our realtor brought us for lunch, giving the whole menu high recommendations.  We have been coming back ever since.  Even drove south from Anthem today for lunch. My all time  favorite is the Abacus Special Chicken.  My husband enjoys the egg rolls and the Poopoo platter. It is a favorite of ours as THE place to eat. Love Abacus Special Chicken. Love it!!"}
{"text":"We found our place! Friendly staff, food is always delivered hot, fast and tastes great! Every order is correct, never a missing item to the order and everyone is happy! Family loves it and it's a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Return visit.  Fried Shrimp dipped in hot mustard and soy sauce top notch.  Vegetable chow mein waste of money.  I love vegetables in my Asian food so when I order the vegetable version of any dish I really want to see the vegetables.  Probably only 1 spoon full of vegies with no variety in type in a full plate of noodles. NOOOOO!
Panda Express would have been better and cheaper with no tip required.  Also they are in such a hurry they don't listen.  I ordered hot tea for the cold night but never received it.  It's the kind of place I should only visit for lunch which is a better deal."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic.  Great service, great food, and you can't beat the pricing, especially for a family.  Oh, and I love the hot tea."}
{"text":"Visiting the Phoenix area for a couple weeks. Friends of my sisters recommended this place so we met here for lunch today.

This is my kind of Chinese place... a small, hole in the wall joint in a strip mall doesn't always bode well for quality food, but sometimes an unauspicious setting can hide a gem of a find. 

The food here is excellent and plentiful and obviously made of good quality ingredients. As I said, it's a small place but we showed up as a group of five and were seated promptly. 

They were ready with a pot of oolong tea, which is served with all meals and was a nice touch. I really love oolong tea. My entree was shrimp with garlic sauce and it was delicious. They give you plenty of big, tender shrimp in a tasty, not-too-garlicky-but-just-enough brown sauce. I couldn't quite finish it despite the fact I was very hungry going in... the portion size might be enough for two people if you get an entree. They also have lunch specials which appear to have smaller sized main entrees but also include an egg roll and a cup of soup.

They kept the pots of tea coming just as fast as our group emptied 'em. 

Fast, attentive, friendly service.  

If I lived in the Phoenix area, this would certainly be one of my go-to places for excellent Chinese take-out or even eat-in, especially if you get there before or after a lunch or dinner rush."}
{"text":"Place smells very very musky-mildewy. I should have left when I smelled the place. I ordered their \"house chicken\" - it was basically overcooked fried chicken in a very watered down teriyaki sauce - I ate two bites and asked for the check. Husband ordered beef with broccoli - it was cold. Don't waste your time. Go to Great Wok instead for great take out."}
{"text":"Great place to eat!  Friendly service, with consistent high quality, great tasting food!  Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this, as soon as we walked in, the food smelled amazing! Unfortunately we didn't get a chance to look at the menu to order.. as I walked to the bathroom to wash my hands, I saw a roach crawling on the bathroom door, I instantly lost my appetite.."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here... 3 entrees and soup cost over $50!  And it wasn't that great.  The orange chicken was very soggy and super sweet.  The beef & broccoli was also sweetly flavored- strange.  The sweet n sour pork was good- glad we ordered the sauce on the side.  Don't think we will return."}
{"text":"Sun Devil Chicken. Try it.

House Special Chicken. Try it.

These are dishes that are distinct enough from standard Chinese fare to bring me back again and again. Though the Abacus looks like any other standard strip-mall Chinese, the creativity the owners show on these two items sets it apart in my mind. 

I've been going there for about 13 years now. 

An old favorite."}
{"text":"I think this is my favorite Chinese restaurant so far in the area of Phoenix. The customer service was so friend and was approached very fast and took my order for a drink. The restaurant seemed to be busy with quite a bit of people which shows that this restaurant must be really good.

I ordered off the lunch menu which was chicken chow mein with white rice and it comes with wontons, spring roll and a choice of soup. I got the hot and sour soup and I thought it was DELICIOUS!! It was definitely one of the best I have had!! The food shortly came after my soup and it was perfect!! The proportion was just right and the food was hot and fresh! I loved the chow mein because it had a lot of fresh veggies on it that was crisp. The lunch was only $8 with my drink which was amazing price! The servers are such sweethearts. 

I look forward to coming back and I can't wait to bring my boyfriend to this place. This is by far my #1 favorite place for Chinese food in Phoenix!! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"went there for the first time saturday night. great staff, prompt service...................a little hiccup with our order, taken care of right away, and best of all the food was really good. thanks guys"}
{"text":"Ok, not sure how this place ended up with 2 Yelp pages, but since I reviewed the other one the last time I came here, I'll do this one for my more recent visit.

I came here with the wife after getting back in Phoenix after a 4th of July weekend up north. The long drive left us hungry and feeling lazy so this was a natural choice since it is the best Chinese food I've found in the area.

Upon our arrival, they had classical music playing. Not at all what I would expect in a Chinese restaurant, and it struck me as weird, but I wasn't there for music. Good conversation and good food easily drowned it out.

We ordered a maitai and hot tea for the wife, a Dr. Pepper for me, egg rolls, crab puffs, kung pao chicken and black pepper chicken.

The drink was perfect and delicious. The egg rolls and crab puffs were perfect as usual.

The kung pao chicken is an old favorite of mine and was just as good as I remember, spicy with a hint of sweet. The black pepper chicken was new to us both and seemed similar in appearance to the kung pao with a couple exceptions.

The black pepper chicken was white meat chicken sauteed with bell pepper, onions, carrots, mushrooms, with a jalapeno spicy special sauce. It was spicy, but a flavorful spicy. Not \"OMG, get me water NOW!\" spicy, but just enough that you felt it. 

Between the two of us, we seemed to favor the black pepper chicken over the kung pao. Both made a very delicious lunch the next day for both of us.

At the end of our meal we were given the traditional fortune cookie as well as what I would describe as a bit of banana in a wonton with honey drizzled on it. That was a pleasant and delicious surprise.

Service was good, as usual with this place. I don't know about all the old poor reviews, but I've never had any issues with this place whether I do take out, delivery, or eat in. It's always good, and always fast."}
{"text":"Love This place, ate here last night. wonderful staff, wonderful food, excellent prices. go here as often as possible"}
{"text":"General Tso's Chicken is great! Very tasty, it said it was hot and spicy on the menu. I found it mild enough. It would be a great choice for someone who is just starting to get spicy things from restaurants. Prices are low and portions big :-)"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place.  Even after I moved from Tempe to Gilbert, I would make the trip to Elliott Rd for the great food.  Recently I've been disappointed by the customer service and food.  If it was once, I would attribute it to an \"off night.\"  Every place has an occasional lapse in quality or service.  When this happened for the 2nd time recently, I started to lose faith in the establishment.  The owner took my order both times and charged me for food I did not receive and then last week prepared a take out entree at full price that was more like a lunch serving and the shrimp were on the scale of salad shrimp.  If the owner talks any faster to expedite the transaction, it will be freaky.  Maybe the restaurant isn't doing well and this is their way of boosting profit.  I honestly hope that's not the case because that never works and usually back-fires.   All I can say is I will not be dining at Abacus Inn on Elliott Rd any time soon.  It's lost quality and value."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin,
   but let this story begin at noon today. I got off work and was craving some Thai volcano beef and that I have to admit I do love. I worked all night requested delivery because leaving the house was just an outlandish idea. So I made my phone call after looking at the menu excited to order and try a new dish and they told me no delivery until 5 PM. Well let me emphasize we order from them about twice a week I've ordered from them in the afternoon multiple times and all of a sudden no delivery until 5:00pm So now I'm waiting for my beautiful bride to get home from a hard day at work. She walks in the door and I tell her we're going to order abacus inn. Thai volcano beef and surprise her with a special dish. So I called them a little after 8:30 PM with gleam, surprise and excitement in My eyes, anticipating that they will take my order with excitement as they usually do! But NO what do they tell me NO delivery after 830PM the driver just left! so I take a deep breath and I realize that I want to work for ABACUS INN because I only have to work from 5 PM to 8:30 PM!!  laughing all the way home as all the hungry people are drowning their sorrows!!!! Giving their money to the next top starred restaurant that delivers on yelp!! This review did hurt to write but I hope it helps others in finding their way too dinner tonight!!! Thank you PONG PONG's for being there for us!!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for a few months now and everything has been fairly decent fried rice and orange chicken... well today I decided to switch it up and regret doing so DO NOT recommend the teriyaki chicken it says \"tender chicken in teriyaki sauce\" NOTHING tender about it crispy on the outside and dry on the inside I highly doubt it's grilled I believe it was thrown in hot oil until cooked-disgusting.. Then I also ordered beef lo mein not necessarily bad however very bland I feel like I overpaid $9 for spaghetti noodles honest , if I decide to go back guess I'll just stick to what I know there"}
{"text":"This place is not good.  

My brother and husband and I decided to stop and try it on a Saturday for lunch.  My brother and I grew up in the area and remember going there back in junior high and high school.  We were wanting something other than fast food and it sounded good so we thought we'd try it. 

Their menu is quite extensive and inexpensive.  The lunch specials are around $7 and include tea, rice, 1 eggroll, 1 wonton, and an entree.  

After reading some other yelp reviews on what to get - my brother and husband both ordered the Mongollion beef.  The beef was questionable at best - like that you get from a frozen dinner. 

I got the orange chicken.  The sauce was super thick and sticky and the meat questionable as well.  

The rice - that was another thing altogether.  It was dark brown and small.  Not really fried rice - I don't know what that was.  I would have preferred a big scoop of white rice. 

The egg rolls tasted horrible too.  Slimy on the inside, etc. 

Will never go back."}
{"text":"Always a booth available, quick service and the big perk for me is their lunch specials are available all 7 days of the week. Excellent full meal for $7!"}
{"text":"We eat here regularly, they have quite a large menu, Egg rolls and won ton soup is wonderful and they have deliver or pickup"}
{"text":"You will not find better Chinese food...HOWEVER...I don't care for seafood or fish and every time I order from here, I have at least one dish have a very strong taste of fish. I order everything chicken but always have something taste very strongly of fish. I don't know if they use the same pots and pans without washing out previous dishes, but the fish taste is very intense. Their noodles are the best I've had, and ordering General Tso's chicken is a MUST! If there wasn't always a fish taste to one of my dishes, I would give Abacus 5 Stars. Obviously it's good enough to risk having something taste like fish."}
{"text":"their dishes are very much improved. i like their general tso chicken, walnut shrimp, hot and sour soup. customer service is good as well. this place is good to celebrate any special celebration with the family."}
{"text":"Great service, the servers are very attentive and friendly. The ambience is warm and inviting. We were seated quickly and drinks came right away in what seemed like relatively busy Saturday dinner time. My boyfriend's shrimp Lo mein was delicious.
I have to say that the garlic shrimp and scallops with vegetables were slightly disappointing. It was all drowning in a very salty brown sauce. The scallops were of a poor quality, tasted and smelled quite fishy, and were very rubbery. Apart from that, it was a pleasant experience. I prefer Shangri-la a little more however there is something about Abacus that makes me want to go back, which I'm sure I'll do."}
{"text":"Abacus Inn is a classic chinese restaurant with wonderful, attentive service and well-worn/loved interior.  We ordered one of their economical family dinners (a package of soup, appetizers, and several main dishes).  Most of the appetizers were delicious, the hot and sour soup was flavorful (and spicy!), but the main dishes left something to be desired.  The fried rice and a chicken dish were rather bland.  I think it is a great place as long as you know what to order.  I'll probably try them again to sample more of their menu.  It's nice to have a restaurant nearby that isn't another bland national chain and has plenty of character and charm."}
{"text":"I ordered, the Orange Chicken lunch combo, with a side order, of shrimp fried rice. The combo, came with an option of 2 soups & a egg roll. It was very flavorful & had, a great balance of sweetness. The shrimp fried rice, was very colorful, with moderate sized shrimp in it. I wanted, to try a dish with snow peas in it, but was told, by the waitress, that they were not sure, when to have them back in stock. So, I decided, to get the consumer I work for, a surprise meal. I was happy with my first visit & will make an effort, to return. CHEERS!!"}
{"text":"Changing to 3 stars. Something has changed here. Not sure if they have new owners, a new cook but the food is not like it once was. Portions are still huge, but they now charge $1 more for fried rice with entrees and the Hot and Sour which used to be the best in town now tastes like sesame oil. My husband's fav Mongolian beef was tender but really had no flavor. And the servers are all new. Please, we want the old Abacus back.


We are a big fan of Abacus, it's the only Chinese Restaurant my husband will go too. He loves their Mongolian Beef. Lunch specials are good until 4:50 pm making it a inexpensive dinner since we both get off of work early.  Specials include your choice of soup (egg drop or hot & sour)I love the hot and sour. Beware of the egg drop, when cool it turns into a weird gelatinous consistancy, a small spring roll, a fried won ton, fried rice (white rice is available if preferred) and your entree'. Most lunch specials are in the $6.95 range. If they are available in addition to the customary fortune cookie you will also receive an amazing fried banana wonton! For 2 lunch specials and 2 beverages our bill is usually around $18.00. 

Service is always good and food is always hot, fresh and portions large.

They deliver too but I can't vouch for it!"}
{"text":"Tried this place based on all the good reviews, but I was seriously let down.
   There were two waitresses just a few feet away from us, but we could not get their attention to try to refill drinks, we had to bring them the glass. There were only 3 tables occupied at the time.
  Food was ok"}
{"text":"when i was 11 my mother taught me how to use an Abacus. i felt like i was given \"ancient chinese secret\". which is odd, because how the hell did my mother get an ancient chinese secret. she was a white woman from Rhode Island..but anyways..i was all into this thing..doing my homework, keeping track of how much money my friends owed me, took it with me when i was buying groceries at the store.

sadly, i got out of practice...now i look at the damn thing like every other american and wonder. wtf it is that thing.

Lunch Specials are affordable, food is pretty good. nothing all that special. it's just  a catch all american-chinese food place. if you in the area and are looking for lunch options give it a try. if you are looking for great asian food, give it a pass. i think i paid 7.50 for lunch. 10 with tip."}
