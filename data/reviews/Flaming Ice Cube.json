{"text":"An excellent place downtown for lunch or dinner. All their food is vegan and really yummy. Their soba noodle dishes are very good with the spicy plum sauce. Addicting actually! Their menu items are yummy and healthy, and their smoothies are very refreshing. I am a vegetarian and I love this place."}
{"text":"Good selection of vegan fare.  The Flaming Ice Cube has everything on the menu from great veggie burgers, appetizers including a mock buffalo chicken dip, and salads.  They also have great baked goods, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate if you're just looking for a small bite to eat, too.  The dining room is small so if you have a large group you might have to get your food to go."}
{"text":"Vegan, intimate, delicious, would definitely go back.  First time visit yesterday for some take-out dinner. Let me just say, props to the three sweet women who do EVERYTHING at this great little vegan place. They waitress, cook, clean, and smile on top of it all! Understandably it's a great little place to sit down and take a breather or peruse their small selection of sale items while waiting for take out.  I ordered a tempeh chickenless salad sandwich, artichoke dip, and chai chocolate drink. My vegan experience has been limited, but I LOVED the sandwich, the dip was good, and the drink was SPOT-ON for a humid day. They had a lot of great looking deserts, a small but diverse menu, and a lot of drink options.  The service was as quick as could be expected, those sitting down seemed to be enjoying themselves, and I was patiently tolerated as I tried to figure out what to get.  Definitely would go back and would recommend for a friend."}
{"text":"Found this place through a vegetarian website and decided to try it as it is close to public transportation and I was taking the train into Downtown Cleveland. So glad I did! The service was super-friendly!  I asked several questions about the menu and my server was very patient.  Really, she was just amazing!  Can't say enough good things about her. The food was delicious.  I ordered the Western Burger just because I thought it would be good with the curry quinoa.  And the curry quinoa was amazing! I wanted to pack some things for my lunch bag the next day, so I also ordered the cranberry almond cookies, an apple muffin, and a bagel sandwich.  Of course, I finished the cookies way before they ever made it to my lunch bag. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"They close at 9 not 7, the fare is flavorful and the servers are very friendly. I really going here :)"}
{"text":"This was a cute little place.  And the burgers were nice - we tried three, and each was good.  Rather similar from one to another, but presumably you're just going to order one dinner, right?  Our one complaint was that the \"cheese\" toppings on them didn't seem to be homemade - seemed highly reminiscent of daiya - which a super-spoiled vegan might be disappointed by.  But maybe if you're traveling with that sort of persnickety dining partner you should tell them to just count their blessings... an all-vegan burger joint and you expect *more*??"}
{"text":"I work downtown, and I always see this place, and have always meant to stop in.  Stopped in there tonight before a concert, extremely eager to finally try it out. The first impression was by far the worst example of hospitality I've ever experienced it. The only employee in the building totally ignored us the first 5 minutes, so we stood around not knowing what to do. We finally see the menu and get to sit down. The food options were endless and exciting, we found it hard to choose only one thing. We narrow it down, only to be told they are out of a lot of things. The service was horrid and   we felt ignored. Overall it was a very disappointing experience.."}
{"text":"The idea of Flaming Ice Cube is very cool. I was brought up as a vegitarian shortly after I exited the womb so FULL vegitarian/vegan restaurants pose an immense attraction to me. The idea of a food joint where I dont have to worry about meat juices dripping on latex gloves right before my food is prepared is grandly satisfying, more than you can imagine.   I enjoyed my Western Burger but my side dish was kaka. I wonder if the chef forgot to taste that day's batch of corn bean salad mix thing. Mis-flavoured from Earth to moon. Even still, 4 out of 5 stars. I will definitely be back for lunch once a week.  Great coffee.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. We ordered a Mediterranean hummus wrap and a pizza burger. For the wrap I asked to substitute the artichoke spread but they said it would be an extra charge of $4.99 (when the artichoke spread comes with the Mediterranean panini at $6.95 whereas the Mediterranean wrap I ordered was &8.49 and yet they still tried to charge me an extra $5) I also asked for avocado which they do not carry. I asked for no olives and they put them in there anyways. We also got curry potato and peas as our sides. They lack any and all seasoning other than them being overly covered in curry powder which is all you can taste. On top of that they advertise to be a vegan restaurant yet they serve honey and do not know if their bread is vegan as they do not know the sources of specific ingredients. As a vegan I strongly discourage you from going here and to find another place with vegan options."}
{"text":"Found this place (thanks Yelp!) amid a wasteland of Quiznos and sketchy-looking delis.  It came complete with east-meets-west decor and a cashier with facial piercings--everything I expect in a vegan establishment.  Had a blueberry muffin straight from the oven that was delicious: not to sweet, lots of blueberries and a tasty crumb topping.  Will probably be back for lunch."}
{"text":"Horrible delivery experience. They told me 45 minutes and it took 2 hrs. After 3 calls I finally got my two cold paninis for $22.00:("}
{"text":"5 STARS!!!  I am vegan (three years) and live in New York City. My best friend is a carnivore and lives in small-town Indiana. We were in town for my brothers wedding and BOY, I did not think I'd find a FULLY VEGAN establishment right in downtown Cleveland!   I was so excited to have stumbled across this gem, we consulted with the wait staff and ordered all of their favorites ($100.00 worth). WOWOWOWOWOWOW it was some of the best vegan food I had ever eaten.  THE BEST OF THE BEST: 1. Mushroom burger 2. TLT 3. Dijonaise 4. Artichoke dip 5. Quesadilla 6. Chocolate chip cookies  WHY WE LOVE THIS PLACE: 1. The staff is SOOO friendly and helpful 2. THE FOOOOD IS SOOO TASTY 3. The location 4. THE PRICES ARE SOOO INEXPENSIVE  WE LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this and the Boardman location for a long time and have always loved their food.  The Asian Wrap is wonderful (add tofu), the Spicy Chick'n Quesadilla a daiya cheese delight, the burgers hearty and filling, and the Warm Artichoke Appetizer a creamy wonder.  Even opting for light fare such as the Spinach Salad w/Organic Tofu & Dried Cranberries is fantastic.  Service is well-intentioned if not terribly efficient, but if you aren't in a huge hurry this is well-worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great for vegetarians and vegans but also just for anyone wanting to try something different. Their tempeh sandwich is really good. The pasta salad side is amazing. A little pricey for the amount of food, but the quality is good."}
{"text":"Found this place using the VegOut app. What a great place! Great location, excellent food, awesome staff and a relaxing & feel at home setting. Great food at great prices. Please check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not the best vegan place, but its Cleveland!  I'd go again.  Try their burgers.  They are the better than other items on the menu."}
{"text":"When I arrived in downtown Cleveland I was shocked to find a vegan restaurant.  Flaming Ice Cube has a great menu and fun daily specials.    I love the vegan chili!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at many vegan/vegetarian resturants over the years. The food here is excellent. It is one of the two or three best vegan resturants I have eaten at. The veggie burgers are the best as was the chick'n quesadilla. Cupcakes were outstanding as well. Prices are fair and servers are very nice and helpful. If you are in Cleveland or Boardman check them out. It is worth the trip."}
{"text":"So a girlfriend and I grabbed lunch to go from here. I am not usually a vegan so i was hesitant. i got the unchicken buffalo sandwich which was AMAZING. I actually craved it the next day and I didnt even expect to like a vegan version of chicken. The menu was nice because it gave you many options. They customer service was fast and the order was ready on time. I got the mushroom soup as well which i did not like but I think it was just not for me. will go back for lunch to go!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because they have decently priced food that is pretty good.   On another note, their customer service is putrid. I went there yesterday to get a few smoothies before work and my order was passed around to different employees. When asked if one of them wanted to make my smoothies a girl said \"sighhhhhh, I guess, can't ___ do it?\" In which she responded \"I guess*rolled eyes*,....\" All of this in front of a customer.  Pretty sure they need to revamp their customer service."}
{"text":"Fantastic vegan food. I loved the pesto burger, the chili, salad, cookie... Everything!"}
{"text":"This place is can be a hit or miss. I have had various items off their menu. The reason I say they are hit or miss they can do an outstanding job providing high quality food. However, at times, the food is sloppily thrown together or they skip an ingredient or two. Also, I wish they would stop selling stale cupcakes."}
{"text":"I had never been  to a Vegan Restaurant  before, a quite frankly, I was afraid of imitation meat.  I was also a little reluctant to try soy products.   I was so pleasantly surprised, I just had to yelp.   I played it \"safe\" by ordering the vegetable barley soup, but the others I was with ordered the Imitation chicken salad, and bologna sandwiches.  It was so nice to share, and everything was so flavorful and tasty.   I will be excited to try another Vegan restaurant!"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but I love this place because the food just tastes really good! I've had the TLT, mushroom burger, asian vegetable wrap. All were really good, and pretty large-sized portions too. The desserts are amazing too, interesting combinations of flavors that give a new kick to your average cookies or cupcakes. I have to say my absolute favorite dessert here is the carrot-ginger chew, kind of like a muffin top that tastes like a cross between pumpkin bread and carrot cake."}
{"text":"This little spot was awesome. I'm not in Cleveland very often. But but next time I'm back I'll stop in for another great Hula Burger. My server was amazing and polite. Can't wait to try other things from the menu. I'll send anyone I know who will be in the area here. Love from Philadelphia."}
{"text":"Quite simply my favorite location in Cleveland to eat! Some of the best vegan burgers I've ever had, my personal favorites being the southwest and mushroom burgers. The location is cozy and a welcoming change of pace for only being a stone's throw from Tower City's plaza. The staff has been pleasant on every visit as well! Prices are what you'd expect for a sit down restaurant, the food is well worth it. The brew of the day are also great, I'd highly suggest the Highland Grog!"}
{"text":"We had the hummus appetizer, which was much smaller than we'd expected for the price. For the amount that I did get, it was tasty and was served with some assorted veggies and pita bread.  My meal was the Spicy Chick'n Quesadilla, which was awesome. Just delicious. For my side, I chose the pasta salad, which was meh. The person I came with had the veggie burger, which was also great. For her side, she chose the black bean salsa, which was flavorful, but didn't actually come with anything to dip it with. She ended up putting it on her burger, which admittedly further improved it.  I plan to come back sometime, and recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Working downtown has made me an Ice Cube addict. The food here is tasty and always presented beautifully. The sunshine salad is always picture perfect and a heaping serving of tasty salad fixings. Their rice bowls are delicious, too, but my all time favorite is the pesto burger. Once I had that, I couldn't go back. These veggie burgers really changed the way I look at veggie burgers--I'm so scared to get one anywhere else because, for me, the Ice Cube has perfected this dish. I'm drooling just thinking about it right now. The sides are hit or miss. I got a Mediterranean pasta once that was strange and not so good, but the curry quinoa was SO GOOD.  The service is always accompanied by a smile, even on the snowiest, busiest, grossest downtown lunch hours, which I truly commend because I know how tough that can be. Whenever anyone questions where to go for a quick, delicious, filling, and healthy lunch, I always point to the Ice Cube because you can't go wrong. Sure there are other good lunch spots downtown, but I never feel gross or bloated when I go here and that's a plus when you have 3-4 more hours of work to get through.   Desserts here are always good, too. The pumpkin cupcakes have delighted me multiple times, as well as chocolate pumpkin bars and brownies.   On a side note, I think the Ice Cube may have gotten a friend and I through the end of 2013 and a pretty stressful-work-through-lunch-and-dinner-at-your-desk project with their burgers to fuel us."}
{"text":"My 5-star trifecta was unexpectedly and easily met by this not-so-hole-in-the-wall hole-in-the-wall.  -Delicious food. Check. Believe me when I say I am *so* not a vegetarian, but between their chili, other soups, chik'n quesadilla and proliferation of amazing dessert options, I was well sated.   -Reasonable prices. Check. Lunch downtown came to about $20... what lunch downtown should come to. (And this is including a frou frou chai latte for the husband).  -Congenial and accommodating service. Everyone who worked there seemed to genuinely enjoy working there (along with their hippyish mantra), and that was much reflected in their attitudes towards their customers.   Flaming Ice Cube, you done good."}
{"text":"I was super happy to find a vegan restaurant during my trip to Cleveland, however I wasn't too impressed by the food but liked the place. The pumpkin coffee I ordered was watery and not very good. The portions were small and the corn salsa had way too much spice. I got the buffalo sandwich and it was essentially just grilled cheese :( My friends got the pizza burger and they really liked it, though. The service is extremely friendly and the atmosphere is nice :) still a good place to check out!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times in the past and always loved it.   Location near the public square with small sitting inside and a few tables outside is fun in summer. I like almost all of the things on menu that I have tried. There is a certain freshness to the food. Taste is pure and enjoyable. Portion size is ideal for one person, so nothing left at the end to take home!!   Wait staff is very friendly and helpful with ordering if you are new. I have not tried any of their desserts but I bet its nice.   I will be a regular here whenever I have to find a place to eat near public square."}
{"text":"I am not vegan, nor do I think I ever could be, but I am certainly a vegan ally. I love eating vegan foods, especially when my token vegan friend prepares them. She has a way with food. Most vegans I had ever encountered simply weren't good cooks, and thus couldn't convince any of us to join them. My friend Jo, however, manages to create flavorful, adventurous, exciting cuisine. I've stolen a number of recipes and recommendations from her.  So, when she wanted to check out the Flaming Ice Cube, I happily tagged along. We walked from Cleveland State, and it was a nice walk in the spring weather (this was an actual spring day, not Cleveland's early Spring which is more like Winter II).  The food was excellent! I ordered a pulled pork sandwich (of course I did). I was simply too intrigued by the concept of faked pulled pork to stray. It was delicious, with a sauce that tended towards the tomato-ey side of the barbecue spectrum.  The barbecue spectrum is thus: vinegar-mustard-dry rub-smoky-tomato-ey. I acknowledge the Carolina barbecue because my best friend is from there and would easily come to blows with me over the concept of true barbecue. She is a smoky/tomato bbq denier. It can't be helped. Me, I am the United Nations of pulled pork appreciation. I love pulled pork in all its colors and flavors, and thus I welcome a vinegary version anytime as long as its mopped over some slow-cooked, tender pork.  I digress. This was a great experience, the bill was reasonable, and I would happily go again if I was in the neighborhood.   Even if you're afraid of vegan food, you may find something you love without even realizing that no animal products were used! And, at a place like this, you won't miss them!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but the table was never wiped clean and we didn't get silverware with our meals.   The other part is pretty curious. I never get sick from eating, but I didn't feel well after eating here for the rest of the evening (we had lunch). I mean, I really didn't feel well.   After seeing how unprofessional the in-restaurant service was, I wouldn't be surprised if the kitchen was much different. Maybe I got something that was spoiled in my meal. It tasted really good, but you never know. Either way, I wasn't impressed, and won't be going back.  I've had much better service in similar-style restaurants."}
{"text":"The Cube is one of my top 5 favorite restaurants of all time! As a vegan, finding a restaurant wherein you are able to eat everything on the menu is quite the luxury! Not to mention the food is incredible! Hands down, the best macaroni salad and cupcakes!!  I've taken omnivore friends here and they enjoy the fare as well! I would just love to see the Flaming Ice Cube expand!"}
{"text":"I spent most of the morning looking for something to eat in the area and had a really hard time finding something with decent vegetarian options. This was a really great find. I had the Asian quinoa bowl and it was awesome. Service was also excellent and it looks like they have great smoothies."}
{"text":"Ever since I started Yelping, I really try to do my research before deciding on a restaurant to go to while at conferences out of town. I feel like the stakes are higher, because there are always so many great places to try in such a short amount of time. I finally decided to stop in here for lunch while I was attending a conference at the convention center a few days ago. I read the great reviews and was excited to see a veggie/vegan place downtown. I was not disappointed. I got the veggie burger with an awesome homemade black bean salsa. Everything tasted scrumptious, the wait staff was really nice, and to be honest: almost everything on the menu looked good enough to try. If I didn't actively make an effort to try other things on my trip, I would have come in here again."}
{"text":"I went to this small eatery with my girlfriend and friends for dessert.  The desserts that we all got were very rich and tasty.  None of the cakes or brownies were dry.  I don't' know if the desserts were truly vegan or if they were vegetarian, but either way it didn't taste like cardboard and is worth going to, especially if you need some chocolate to comfort you after losing money at the casino across the street."}
{"text":"Best veggie burger! Stopped in for dinner but didn't get to stay, I left tickets for a show at the hotel. Got my order to go. The veggie burger is a must try! It is hands down one of the very best I have ever had. The waitress was so very kind and friendly. Will definitely come back when in town!"}
{"text":"This little vegan eatery shares space with a yarn shop, and oozes atmosphere in a very pleasing way.  I was passing through town on a cross-country road-trip and was curious about the veggie burger, which was ranked in the top 10 in the country by a VegNews article.  Naturally, I tried the veggie burger with a side of macaroni salad.  It was, indeed very tasty with melted Daiya on top with a tasty, creamy sauce.  The macaroni salad was good, but somewhat bland to my taste.  We hit the road with some desserts in tow: red velvet cupcake and carrot cake.  They were both excellent!  This was all-n'-all a worthwhile experience.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful.  Food was served fast.  And the food was really enjoyable.  If I lived in the area, I would go here every week and try something new each time."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have the best vegan burgers. The staff is always cool too. Just had the Pineapple, OJ, Strawberry smoothie today and it was delicious !!!   I wish they had one in Lakewood though. Downtown isn't convenient to get to. This could easily become my favorite food place!!  Love!"}
{"text":"People want to eat vegan.  They don't want to BE vegan.  The Flaming Ice Cube helps with that.    Which is to say that douchebag vegans have ruined the concept for everyone, since the popular vision is an emaciated hipster with BO berating you for killing the planet.  But there's another kind of casual veganism, one that involves actually just liking the taste of the food and wanting the health benefits....  ...and you know what?  The Flaming Ice Cube is cozy. The place is small, but comfortable.  The staff smile and will answer your questions.  And they all look healthy, happy, and at ease, which means you will be too.    Let us be honest and say that if you're seeking for the heights of vegan cuisine, you'll want Pura Vida a few doors down.  But Flaming Ice Cube is about sandwiches, smoothies, wraps, and muffins - quick lunch fare, served tastefully.  It's kind of like a great B-movie, like, say, The Princess Bride or Galaxy Quest - they weren't shooting for high art when they made their films, but like Babe Ruth, they pointed their finger and hit the ball right to that goddamned home run.   ...did I just mix sports metaphors with movie metaphors while describing food?  Crap, I did.  In any case, what you get are sandwiches and veggie burgers - never the pinnacle of haute cuisine - but the sandwiches are triple-A sandwiches.    The sandwiches, it must be said, focus pretty heavily on the meat-alternatives - you can have a variety of soyburgers and tempeh.  But they're smart enough to realize that nothing is going to replace the taste of a juicy burger, so all the sandwiches concentrate on the flavor you put on top of the burger.  So you get pesto burgers with cheese topping, or chickenless salad sandwich with a lot of vegan mayo, or mushroom burgers with cheese and onions.  Which makes the burgers pretty tasty.   Also tasty: their smoothies, which may be the best in town.  They're pure vegan, which is to say you're getting yogurt and not a lot of corn syrup (if any!), but they do layer the flavors so they're amazing and candylike.   The disappointment is their hummus, which is a little dry and tasteless.  But their side dishes, which change daily, are usually very yummy, and today I had a marinara \"meatball\" sub that I couldn't have told you was faked.  (Again, you put the \"meat\" in enough zingy sauces and ricotta cheese, and you won't notice it ain't meat.)    Also, they have vegan cupcakes, which are damn delicious.  As someone who'd never had a vegan cupcake, I approached it like it was carob - which is to say, the kind of thing someone would only say \"tastes like chocolate\" if they'd forgotten what chocolate tasted like - and I couldn't tell it wasn't filled with eggs.  It was moist (unlike some of the vegan cupcakes I've tasted since, which err on the dry side) and the frosting was delectable.    So for the price, this is a slam dunk.  It's a comfort restaurant, with thoughtful design and placement and very nice people.  It might just change your mind about this whole vegan idea.  It makes me happy to know they're in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Amazing food, right next to tower city and the house of blues.  Pros: so many choices all vegan and can be made gluten free, great coffee, and perfect smoothies. Cons: had trouble understanding the server, she did have as accent but she was just too quiet to hear, coffee is always old in the evening but they're always happy to brew now when you ask. Don't forget to ask about their flavored coffee, there's always something interesting like love portion or raspberry creme brule, desserts look fantastic though I've never had the luxury of treating one because I'm always so full after the delicious meal!"}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot right in the heart of Cleveland's down town. It is categorized as a vegan restaurant but, don't worry, it's hearty and will fill you up!  Their salads cost around $7-8 and are quite large. Even though each one doesn't have many ingredients---all of them flow together and are unique. The spinach is pretty good---and the dressing they put on it is amazing. I've also heard good things about their soba noodle salad.  The pastries look delicious! Muffins and cupcakes are about $2. Their cakes are massive and each slice looks like a meal in itself. They also have smoothies and soups. I tried their sweet potato peanut butter soup and it was delicious. The black bean chili also seemed to be pretty popular. Watch out, though, these things will be hot and burn your mouth!  If you're planning on sitting, get in before the lunch hour because it has a limited space and fills up really quickly."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved their $1.85 house coffee with coconut creamer! Their burgers are mind-glowingly amazing. I must point out that my friend who came with me is the epitome of a carnivorous meat-eater, and loved the burgers and smoothies. He never knew vegan could taste so good! I love this place and the prices are great!"}
{"text":"NOOOO!!!! I regret that I never posted a review prior to their closing. This was my absolute favorite vegan restaurant in Cleveland. Wow... It'll be missed.  Their Mediterranean Hummus Wrap was to die for!"}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian, not a vegan, but I still love this place. Being in Cleveland, much of the big name restaurants usually have a few meat-free options, but you can run into some trouble finding something to eat at times. That's why I like The Flaming Ice Cube.  I wasn't too familiar with some of the substitute products, but they tasted great. I'm a big fan of veggie burgers, so I just went ahead and ordered the standard burger with a side of hummus. Their hummus is very delicious, smooth and flavorful. I was expecting the veggie burger to be like many of the others I had had in Cleveland- either made with a chickpea or black bean base, chock full of veggies and spices. Instead, it was made to kind of look and taste like a Boca burger. I'm not a fan of those burgers at all (I would rather eat cardboard than those at a barbecue), but these were actually good. The patty is also pretty thick, making for a big burger.  I can't wait to go back and try some of the other options they have!"}
{"text":"OHHHHHHMMM-G!   Love, love, love this spot. Was visiting from Cincinnati and stumbled upon this joint. Loved the calming atmosphere -the smoothies, the food... excellent! Even left with a few inspirational gifts -bought the Dalai Lama tapestry right out of the window. LOL.  Our waitress was extremely personable and loved the decor! Very relaxing, welcoming... peaceful. I also appreciate the \"local\" aspect as well.  I'd come back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Most items are fresh and made in-house. You can get everything from a 'buffalo chik'n' flatbread to a soba noodle bowl. The desserts are quite delectable, and I love the array of juice, tea, and specialty coffee drinks that are available.  You can also buy certain vegan food items and other locally made products like chapsticks and candles in the small store area.  Flaming Ice Cube is certainly on my Top 10 vegan-friendly places to visit in Cleveland. http://veganhostess.com/vegan-cleveland-restaurants-coffee-shops-more/"}
{"text":"Was stuck in Cleveland for two day, got off the train @ Tower Center and found this gem. Great Food, Service and Prices. Where as they don't have super healthy food like green juices and some more kale, collard and mustard green additions would have been nice they did they trick, try the Asian wrap with Chikn or the Chinkn Green Onion Salad awesome, ate 3 of 5 meals here while in town! Must try"}
{"text":"See my profile for the location of my blog containing the full review and pictures.  A very early departure put us in Cleveland early in the AM.  Our rooms weren't ready yet so after killing a half hour in the lobby we got one of the two rooms and went to hang out.  After another half hour the second room was ready.  That was my room.  As I travel down this road of life various questions percolate to the surface of my consciousness.  Why do things run in clumps?  Why do you tend to have similar experiences in groups?  Why do hotel chains build places to rest next to interstate highways when a block or two in any direction would take care of the noise problem?  Why do I keep getting rooms on the highway side of the hotel?  Isn't this a food blog?  Well yes but it can't be unless I'm well rested and that couldn't happen until I changed rooms.  I know, I know, I'm lucky that the hotel had another room on the quiet side.  So after packing everything up and moving I unpacked and found the internet wasn't working.  I'm just sayin', you think this is an easy life.  There's a big convention next door at Best Buy and apparently, (or so we've been told), they're piggybacking on the Hilton's network. But I'm on now so as my dad says, \"Keep on comin' on comin'.\"  OK, Cleveland.  Home of Mr. Pork, Iron Chef Michael Symon.  (I actually stopped by Lola's Bistro to ask about vegan options and they said if I called ahead the chefs might be able to make something special.  I've had this response before and had some pretty amazing meals prepared for me but without advance notice almost everything had dairy or cheese in it so dinner would be sides and a salad should we decide to take out second mortgages and eat here.)    Luckily Cleveland has the Flaming Ice Cube.  I had no idea what a Flaming Ice Cube is.  Oxymoron?  Juxtaposition?  An effeminate solid block of water?It's a good little vegan quick and easy, mellow, (did I mention vegan), sandwich shop in downtown Cleveland and I wish I had one around the corner from where I lived.  The place is a happy bright half display counter full of Sweet and Sara's Marshmallows, cupcakes, muffins and delightful sweets, and half dining room with 20 seats plus a few outside tables.  We scored a window seat and watched Cleveland walk by without melting.  OK, it wasn't that hot today.  There were so many choices I asked our waitress Julie for a suggestion and she steered me to the Pesto Burger or Buffalo Panini.  I didn't want to roll with garlic breath while exploring and the Chick'n on the menu is Gardein based and that included the Buffalo Panini.  I wanted a taste of what this place had to offer so went with the Mushroom Burger, side of Black Bean and Corn salsa and as a starter, the Lettuce Wrap. I started the meal off with a cup of excellent coffee served with Silk creamer.  Sometimes a cup of coffee is the hinge-pin of a meal, either as a summation or first taste.  This was a good cup of coffee.    Soup of the day was a Chili. The chili was robust and flavorful with a nice touch of heat.  This was definitely a soup-y chili.  I'm more of a thick chili aficionado but there was nothing wrong with this bowl at all!  Asian Tempeh Lettuce Wraps Organic tempeh sautéed with water chestnuts and mushrooms, then served with lettuce leaves, cucumber, tomato, and our signature peanut sauce and plum sauce. $7.95   For the DIYer.  Here are all the components now you build it yourself. The lettuce wraps were interesting structurally.  I'm not sure the romaine was the best choice of lettuce for the maneuverability of the dish but as you can see from the half devoured wrap below all obstacles to consumption were easily overcome.  I mean, romaine vs butter/boston or just iceberg would make the wrap more ... well, wrappable but the long thin spear of romaine worked well enough.  And the flavor was a nice umami savory with tempeh and waterchestnut crunch and soft mushrooms diced finely enough to lay in the lettuce.  The chunky tomatoes, cucumbers and plum sauce added a nice finish.  The peanut was a thinned out peanut sauce with a bit of heat but my favorite was the sweet plum sauce.   Holding capacity is limited because of the thin width of the romaine and it's a hard lettuce to actually \"wrap\" around the filling but couldn't escape our hungry maws.  Mmmushroom Burger Our vegan burger with fresh sautéed mushrooms, mozzarella, mayo and sautéed onions. $7.45   What an inviting plate!  The mushroom burger on a standard roll was inviting visually.  The generous mushroom and onion topping with the dramatic flair of veganaise just cried out with a promise of deliciousness.

{"text":"Stopped by here because it's hard to find dairy-free deserts anywhere and I really wanted a desert.  I got their molten lava chocolate cake, which was heated up.  Very delicious though there was very little of the chocolate pudding the menu says it has.  Still, it was a satisfying morsel.  It was more expensive than I thought it would be though.  The staff were very nice and I like that they're dressed how they want and everyone knows what's in the food they serve.  Will be going back to try a brownie."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Had a chili soup that was seasoned but needed a pinch of salt. The pesto burger was amazing and the amAsian quinoa bowl was a delight. The desserts were yummy, too: pumpkin cupcake with a buttercream frosting and a carrot cake with cream cheese icing. Let the celebration begin!"}
{"text":"Came here on a quiet Monday evening with some friends who are vegan. This is the only vegan-only place that I know of in the downtown area.   When you enter, there's a small store that features vegan products. The seating for the restaurant is pretty small - just a few tables. The food was great though - I was very full from my vegan burger and would definitely come back for more. I wish there was more flavor on the burger, but the patty itself was great.  The only downside was that parking was hard, especially when it's cold and wintry out. Great area though, and I hope that people continue to love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"If I was only rating for the food, this place would get four stars.  But rating for other things -- decor, availability of foods -- it would get one star.  Pros: The pulled BBQ chicken sandwich was so good I had two of them.  The potato salad was delicious too. The staff is really friendly. The location is great; near Tower City and East 4th.  Cons: The coffee was unbearably weak. They ran out of creamer; the juicer was broken and they got my friend's takeout order wrong.  The place needs a head-to-toe makeover; it looks thrown together, and the sign outside says 80's mall.  The seating is dour, and needs an updating.  Overall, the food is the best reason to come here, but it's not much to look at.  I love that this place exists though!  I just wish it was a little hipper."}
{"text":"I loved this place.  being from out of town, and staying at the Marriott across Public Square, this was such heaven being so close.  We had to wait about 10 minutes to get a table on a friday afternoon.    I was a little annoyed because there were two tables where one person was reading a book and another were just talking and there were about 3 groups waiting.  Have some decency and leave if you want to read or have a chit-chat (they were DEFINITELY done eating and the waitress had already picked up the check).  Food was amazing and service was very fast and friendly.  Even my mother (who's not a vegan/vegetarian) loved her food.  We went back for a second time the next day and were dismayed that they weren't open on sundays.  Corn salsa was OK, definitely the macaroni salad was the better option.  Menu is vast and there's a lot to choose from  Would definitely go back, but unfortunately won't be in Cleveland anytime in the near future though"}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland last week for a conference and needed to find a convenient vegan friendly place to call my foodie home away from home. FIC to the rescue. Staying nearby at the Marriott, it was a short walk to FIC each evening for a filling, affordable vegan dinner. I look for a few things in a restaurant: Fresh ingredients, Large salads, great tasting entrees. I don't do dessert so I have no comments about those.   My dinner each day consisted of the Flaming Ice Cube house salad with either oil and vinegar (it comes with their own ranch) or with a topping of hummus (which was excellent) or with one of their veggie burgers on top. One evening I had their Mmmushroom burger too. It was quite nice.   Some things to note: There website needs a serious overhaul. Service can be a little slow. If you are in a rush, you would be wise to let them know. The staff is excellent. Friendly and knowledgeable. I gave 4 stars because 5 stars is vegan nirvana. I'm not sure I've truly experience that yet, anywhere.   Let there be no doubt, if I ever find myself in Cleveland again, FIC will be my go-to place for a solid, reliable, tasty vegan meal. When you get to Cleveland, stop in. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good and healthy food. A cute little place that gets crowded at lunch."}
{"text":"Flaming Ice Cube is a reliable place to get lunch when I'm in Cleveland for work. I appreciate that the food is fresh and healthy, but I haven't been particularly impressed with the tastes and flavors of my orders. The Mediterranean wrap with hummus and quinoa added is great sometimes and skimpy other times. I do like the desserts though (a little too much)!"}
{"text":"Went here to see what all the hype is about. The food was good but dine-in is very limited to several tables.   I ordered the pizza burger and I felt they could have added a few more spices. The taste was bland and luckily I choose to add the extra topping supreme which gave it a little more flavor, but what do you expect from a vege burger. The burger was hard to eat because once u take a bite all the toppings would fall out the other end; I had to resort to a fork and knife!  Overall, the service and food was good."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place for the first time today. It's a nice little spot, kind of adorable actually. Helpful friendly staff. As a newcomer I asked what would be good to try. I was recommended a popular item, the TLT with a side - green bean casserole. The food was delicious. I will be returning, soon."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today.  I've eaten here before, but its been a while.  Service is always inconsistent, takeout/dine-in.   This is the first time that I was a little disappointed with portions, price and service.   I ordered the salad platter, which contained quinoa, kalebouli, hummus and toasted flatbread for $8.99 (add salad dressing for $.45), as stated on the menu. My order arrived and consisted of heaping tablespoons of each option, and the quinoa was steaming hot and plain, no spices, additions etc.   I expected cold options on a salad platter and since there was an option to add salad dressing, I also thought that the plate would be dressed with at least some lettuce and and maybe some lemon wedges.   I beckoned for the waitress and asked if I could exchange the quinoa for another serving of kalebouli, which she obliged.   In addition the flatbread was just plain pita (cold and a little bit stale, not toasted).   The hummus was a little thick for dipping, (okay for a wrap), and the kalebouli was very good.  It was a great makeover of tabouli, but kale was substituted for parsley, also included onions, cucumbers tomatoes and it was dressed with olive oil and lemon.   I finished the meal wishing that I had ordered a bowl of soup to accompany the meager offerings on my \"platter\".  I requested the check and upon review, instead of substituting the kalebouli for the quinoa, I was charged an additional $2.50, even though I returned the quinoa immediately upon receiving it, because it was served hot and not cold.  The platter wasn't worth $8.99, and it definitely wasn't worth the resulting $12.  I explained this to  the server.   She returned with the adjusted bill, but also mentioned with an attitude that my bill was adjusted this time, but the next time that I don't like something, I'll have to pay for it (wow....).   I'll go back at some point, because of the healthy options, but this won't be my go to place for lunch:-("}
{"text":"I have 3 words to ! Awesome Delicious Nutritious . The staff here is amazing and they take pride in their job , there are here at work because love to come to work and they serve amazing super delicious food !"}
{"text":"I trekked over here because I had not had a decent meal since I landed yesterday. The reviews were so stellar that I got stoked, and was dreaming of fresh kale and mango juice and veggie based dishes.  Most of the menu is actually based on processed meat substitutes, and a significant chunk of it comes w/mayo.   I tried the Spicy Chick'n and the smoothie on special (Frozen Cranberries, eggnog), and they were pretty underwhelming. They aren't bad, but when my regular vegan place is so fucking stellar (Green Seed in Houston!), I was just expecting a LOT more.  So, definitely a place to eat if you're vegan; not a place to eat vegetables if you can get them elsewhere.   (Oh, and it's cheap, so that is also pretty cool. Under $10 for my meal. So go for it, Cleveland vegans.)"}
{"text":"the food is good. and pretty decently priced. i was so excited this was being put in when i heard a while back... ive had great experiences at the FIC in boardman, ohio.  my only gripe is the S-L-O-W service. it seems like everytime im there, every single person is brand new. i dont know what you have you have to do to keep people working there longer than a week... but ya need to do it FIC. cause people are annoyed. pay workers an extra dollar an hour... give them free food. i dont know! anything to light a fire under their ass!  but alas, i keep going back. probably not as often as i would if i could get carry out in under 30 minutes. but the food is good enough and close to my job. i really hope they can get their act together service-wise so it doesnt end up shutting down."}
{"text":"By far my favorite vegan place to eat. I have been here over 10 times and have never had a bad meal each time. I am not sure if a lot of people know about it but during lunch it does seem to always be busy !!!! We never are let down here ! I got back at least once a month !!!!"}
{"text":"Okay upon further review: the majority of their ingredients for sandwiches is processed. I am allergic to metal so if you are allergic to nickel I would suggest asking which ingredients come from a can before you order. The food is prepared with great presentation and staff is friendly. However , this restaurant does not have fresh ingredients for all of their menu items. This is not clearly stated on the menu or online. Basically, be careful as not all of their ingredients including fruits and vegetables are not organic or fresh meaning they do contain pesticides. Be sure to ask for the private ingredient list for the menu items listed."}
{"text":"Seems like every other review starts with a Declaration Of Food Principles:  Know all men by these presents: I have never knowingly eaten a living thing, be it fish, fowl, cloven-hooved or otherwise, and detest those who do, haunting their every foodie conversation and hounding their every dinner party.  Further, be it noted that if your lips have touched meat, they will never touch my... uh... \"meat.\"  Ewww.  Yeah, okay, okay.  Relax Moonbeam.  It's really not that serious.  I eat pretty healthy food for the most part, and rarely eat anything that isn't plucked from a garden, or tree, or the sea so while I was working downtown I decided to stop in to the Flaming Ice Cube for a quick sammie-on-the-run.  Then, a few days later, I stopped in for a sit-down salad.    The dining room is pretty darned small.  (Can a vegan use the word \"darn?\"  I didn't see that particular sensitivity ruling on the menu.)  Probably eight tables, maybe seating twenty or so diners.  I have to believe that most just grab something to take back to the office, or park, or casino, or \"Honey, I'll be running a little late, Megan from Accounting and I are shacking up at the Intercontinental for the afternoon.  Turns out she'll do what you won't.  Be home by six or so!\"  Sure, on the way across Public Square I had already taken down a rare Northern Bald Ibis, cleaned it, and roast it on a spit, sharing a drum-stick with one of the park residents, but I still had a hankerin' for a salad.  Their Sunshine Salad, with all that great green stuff, fruits and dressing, was a bit like that summer I spent in Ibiza, with Gretchen, the girl who could pass wind in every key signature, and the time we hitch-hiked across Siberia...  But I digress.  (Often professionally.)  Check out the Cube.  If you hate it, the meal's on me.  You won't.  I mean, hate it.  Overtip the waitress.  She's working WAY too hard.  \"Once, during Prohibition, I was forced to live for days on nothing but food and water.\"   W. C. Fields"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed by the food at Flaming Ice Cube, whether you're actually vegan or just feeling adventurous this food is absolutely delicious. Don't know what to order? The quinoa bowl is awesome!!"}
{"text":"The Flaming Ice Cube serves really tasty vegan food! I had the corn chowder which was really great, as well as the pizza burger, which was pretty good. Our server told me the burger was really filling. I ordered it since I was starving, but by the time I finished my soup I could only make it halfway through the burger. We also got pumpkin cupcakes, which were perfect - I would never have known they were vegan!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is a little bit on the pricey side but it is worth it when you taste it. The specials are always good, service is always fast even during the lunch rush. I am never disappointed."}
{"text":"The food at the Flaming Ice Cube was good.  I'm a meat-eater, but I found their veggie burger to be quite tasty, though I wouldn't give up meat for it.  The hummus appetizer was spectacular.  The service was less than adequate.  Several times, a waiter or waitress rushed by us and told us that our food would be up momentarily while we were left stuttering that we hadn't even ordered yet.  I think the waitress may have been new.  Based on the quality of the food, I would go back.  People have off-days, so I wouldn't write the place off based on one experience, especially not given the quality of the food.  The location is great."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch after coming into town.   The servers were very sweet and game me some good dessert recommendations (oreo brownie).   It's at a busy intersection downtown.  Would definitely recommend for any vegetarian or vegan in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The office took lunch orders for Flaming Ice Cube.  To their credit, delivery was fairly quick (though there is an extra $2.50 delivery charge).  I got the Pizza Burger ($7.99), which is vegan pepperoni, marinara, and mozzarella on top of a vegan burger.  It was pretty good for a vegan burger; if you're doing comparisons to a regular burger it would fare...less well.  The marinara sauce was a little on the bland side.  I would strongly recommend kicking in the extra $0.89 to add mushrooms, onions, and green peppers--those extra toppings saved the burger for me.  The pesto pasta side (included) was not good--very mushy and, again, short on taste."}
{"text":"When my BIL and my sister were talking up a cool new vegan place in Cleveland, I was intrigued. To have more than 1 choice? Really?   And this place did not disappoint. The spring rolls were tasty as was the peanut sauce that came with it. The tempeh chick'n salad was very tasty as was the o so creamy buffalo chick'n sandwich. The smoothie samples were also tasty.   The service was pretty good. It's a little tiny in ambiance, but definitely a great find. The best vegetarian place I've ever visited. The view was really lovely too. Eager to go back there for another visit!"}
{"text":"pretty happy to have stumbled on this. not a lot else around that fully embraces veg*n food options and this place had so much to choose from i probably could have eaten here every day if they had better hours. still, the hamburger was delicious and the service was friendly and quick. the chai smoothie drink was OK but if I were to return I probably would not order that again."}
{"text":"So, I'm thinking about asking the owners if I can move in.  You know, have a little bed in the back, close to where they bake things.  I won't live there all the time, just in time for dinner.    Seriously, the food (pleasant even for non-vegans!), location, and heart behind this cafe is everything I could hope for.  Flaming Ice Cube is where hubby and I find ourselves noshing every time we're even close to Public Square.  The veggie burgers are huge in size and flavor, and their dark cherry chocolate brownie is my silver lining.  Follow FIC on Facebook and you will find yourself drooling over their daily menus, like I do.  I think I'll go shopping for that bed now."}
{"text":"Pros: Awesome vegan food! Nice variety. Warm, friendly staff. Favorite menu items: supreme pizza burger, mushroom burger, Italian pannini. Order everything with extra \"cheese\" and a side of pesto. The pesto is amazing and makes everything taste heavenly.  Cons: No bathroom! Wtf??!!!! No parking. Only deliver before 6pm. Menu doesn't change. Never have carry out menus available. No bar or atmosphere. Closed Sundays.    What to do: View menu online. Order carry out (remember: extra \"cheese\" and pesto!) and devour at home, or wherever you may be able to enjoy a \"refreshment\" and the use of a bathroom."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service, convenient location.  Will return when I'm back in Cleveland.  Thx."}
{"text":"Its.. kind of yummy? I like the flavors in my tempeh salad wrap, but I didn't like that everything fell out as soon as I lifted it off the plate. How am I supposed to eat this?!   There was also a tempeh pesto burger with caramelized onions and OH MY HEAVENS those onions were extremely caramelized; it was kind of... okay.  I also didn't like the macaroni salad or the corn/bean salsa."}
{"text":"The First Day - 3 stars   A laid black place, in the middle of downtown, great location. I had the burger, artichoke dip, berry banana smoothie and the iced chi. All the food was very good, flavorful and filling and the portions were good. The burger wasn't the usual paddy, it looked like it was made in house, filling, flavorful with a spicy mayo sauce and imitation bacon.   Finished off with freshly frosted coconut cupcakes. It looked like a good place for lunch, pretty quiet for dinner.   Second Day..  I wandered down Euclid ave and found myself in front this place. Next thing I know I'm reaching for the menu, my mouth waters as I looked at the burgers and next thing I know I'm walking back to my hotel and biting into the mushroom burger...  ITS THE BEST TASTING FAKE MEAT EVER! I think its something about the fluffy texture of the patty with this complex bite satisfying sensation.   Now I'm writing the review. and burping."}
{"text":"These two are my all-time favorites:   Dijonaise Panini ($6.95) Chunky chick'n salad in creamy dijon dressing with spinach, tomato, onion, and bac'n bits pressed in ciabatta bread.  Vegan Burger ($5.99) Our homemade grilled vegan burger served with all the fixing's - lettuce, tomato, onion, mustard, ketchup and vegan mayo."}
{"text":"Not to be a snob or anything but, what the hell is this place doing in Cleveland?  I was in town for a week, and managed to eat here three times.  A+ for the mmmmushroom burger, sweet potato/peanut butter soup, soba salad, hot artichoke dip, and mediterranean pizza - which has a base of the artichoke dip, and I'm pretty sure that the base (\"flatbread\") is a chapati. MMM.  Note that you can also get gluten-free buns for the burgers.  I'm so irritated that I crave something in Cleveland. I hope there are enough vegans around to keep them open - but non-vegans, you will enjoy this too.  I was the only vegan at the table for all 3 visits."}
{"text":"I consider myself pretty adventurous with food. I've even had my fair share of Boca burgers and faux chicken, but for some reason the idea of vegan restaurants scares the pants off of me. I start reading things like vegan mayo and soy cheese and I imagine flavors and textures like candle wax.  In this case I was wrong. I am blown away by how good my lunch was at Flaming Ice Cube. I had the Buffalo Panini - which is buffalo chik'n spread with spinach, tomato and onions on pressed ciabatta. It. was. fantastic. The spread was like a better version of the buffalo chicken dip I've had at so many holiday parties. The bread was light and fresh with a crispy exterior. I am not usually a fan of soft spreads in sandwiches but I found the spread-to-bread ratio to be perfect.   Sandwiches come with the side option of corn and black bean salsa or Mediterranean pasta salad. I opted for the salsa, which was a hearty mix of black beans, corn and poblano peppers. It was very reminiscent of my long-gone favorite side at Einstein Bagels.  Aside from sandwiches, the restaurant offers breakfast, smoothies, salads, burgers and desserts along with an assortment of teas, chips, bars and the like.   The only reason they lose a star is because the restaurant is very small and, in the winter, very cold. I was shivering up a storm while waiting for my food."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here, I wonder why I don't come here more frequently because it is AWESOME. Somehow, Flaming Ice Cube knows how to intensify every flavor in the food they serve and it makes any meal there a rock solid experience.   I haven't tried any of their burgers, but their sandwiches are on point. I highly recommend the Mediterranean panini and the Asian wrap. Their peanut sauce is grant! The black bean salsa side is amazing. I could eat a giant bowl of that stuff. Seriously. They should make it an appetizer option with chips. Or an epic salad. Something to showcase it and let me eat large mounds of it! I think it's the lime that makes it so good... But it's just bursting with flavor!   Lunch, dinner, whatever. Go to Flaming Ice Cube and rediscover the flavor in your food."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best veggie burger in Cleveland (and maybe the best anywhere).  The mushroom burger is outstanding as are the desserts."}
{"text":"So glad there's a vegan option in Cleveland! If you're looking for a no frills, casual place to enjoy mock versions of traditional dishes (\"chicken\" quesadillas, vegan burgers, wraps & such) this is a great spot. They also make really great smoothies and the BEST peanut butter crunch bar!! All vegan, all the time. Yummy!"}
{"text":"For vegan food this place is pretty good and it's nice to have a vegan option that isn't a salad.  The menu is extensive and eating there daily would take a few weeks to try everything.  The sandwiches look small but paired with the side the meal always fills me up but not to the point where I feel like I'm going explode.  I recommended the Buffalo Pannini.  It's awesome. Edit:  Since writing this initial review I tried the Pesto Burger.  I had to scrape my brains off the wall because my mind was blown by how awesome it was.  I also have had the buffalo chicken dip which was okay.  The nice part about it is they put a ton of fake chicken in it.  I also had the artichoke dip.  It was amazing.  I now know what the nectar of the gods tastes like.  You get warmed pita bread served with it but I bet it would be awesome with a soft pretzel.  It's not too bad cold the next day.  In conclusion, this place still rules."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Fresh wholesome food and ORGANIC! The Asian Quinoa Bowl is delicious.  Organic oped with sautéed Asian vegetables,  baked tofu and the signature peanut plumb vinaigrette.  VERY HAPPY"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Great vegan burgers! Hidden gem in downtown cleveland"}
{"text":"As a former long time vegetarian, i love that we have this option in downtown cleveland. On both my visits during lunch at work though the wait after ordering was really long. On my last visit i had some kind of thai salad w plum sauce which i did not care for, but i will cettainly be back to try something else. The decor also looks like a college dorm, but i can get past that."}
{"text":"Everytime I go, the food is soooo good. I've had the quesadilla, pesto burger, soba noodles, and hummus tabouli wrap and all were wonderful. Their smoothies and daily ice teas are refreshing as well. Finally, if you're looking for a sweet treat that's just the right size and you'll have some to save for later, get the three cookies for $2.   Since they make everything from scratch you'll have to wait a little longer but who cares?! Friendly staff and delicious and healthy food, you can't beat it. Almost makes me want to turn Vegan...Almost."}
{"text":"A friend suggested we try the Flaming Ice Cube for lunch one day and I have to say I was initially intrigued by the name. Flaming Ice Cube? It sounded more like a bar or circus performance than a vegan restaurant. As soon as we arrived though I was overly excited about the menu, everything looked so good!   Normally I'm a HUGE fan of vegan/vegetarian style restaurants because most of the time they cater to the gluten free side of me as well. However, I was disappointed that there lacked a diversity in that department. However, like most of the time I eat out, they were more than willing to serve me a vegan burger, sans bun and the Pizza Burger was awesome (I'm normally grossed out my vegan pepperoni).   Dessert is always my favorite meal in any restaurant (let's be honest I go survive solely on ice cream) and the Cube's peanut butter crunch bar was to die for. The dessert did make up the fact that the service was quite slow. Everyone was very friendly and nice and I'm not sure if it was because we were sitting in their outside seating or just the amount of lunch traffic they had but it took much longer than expected to get anything, water or food. Loved the food once it came, but not sure if I would make a special trip again."}
{"text":"OK omnivores, shed your mind from its skin and place yourself in an \"avatar,\" because you're about to be transported to Pandora. Where the locals love the leaves and greenery, you're sure to fall in love with their way of life. Flaming Ice cube is the vegan planet you visit in Downtown Cleveland when you don't want to get blown away by the lake breeze.  The storefront is homely and low-key, step inside and the tune changes. You'll be greeted with greens and yellows, tapestries and various little trinkets. It is a welcomed change from the streets right outside. The service was relaxed and friendly and definitely not afraid to give some good recommendations. A bonus to the service was that it was fast, we had our meal prepared and completed within 30 minutes.   This is a difficult review to write because I truly hold vegan establishments up to high esteem for their delicateness and devotion to the dining dream. With that in mind, we began with the summer rolls. A simple leafy mix wrapped in two rolls and served with a signature peanut sauce. I must say, the sauce gave the rolls a great kick, but without it... they could not standalone. No worries, it's not all a wrap yet.  Or is it? We opted to get the two item combo deal for $6.99, a half-sandwich and soup or side. The variety here has to be commended because it seems there is a good selection of what the day's special has to offer. We both took the deal. She got the half-hummus-veggie-wrap and the macaroni salad side. I got the salad wrap and the special curried quinoa.  The eating commenced and something was already a-miss. Did we get the right things? It turns out, our plates were switched. Now I know what you're thinking, \"How can you confuse two different wraps?\" EASILY MY FRIENDS. These were two wraps with leafy greens, hummus, and some various veggies. To me, they essentially tasted the same. The highlight of the wraps, was the lemon-tahini sauce that came with the hummus veggie. I would buy a bottle of that to put on any sandwich.  The macaroni salad, while yummy, did not assist in transcending body and spirit. The curried quinoa was a nice attempt at showcasing a deep Indian flavor, but missed the mark by being overly sweet and masking the titillating fluffy texture of the quinoa.   But go check out Flaming Ice Cube. I give it three stars because it is a fledgling vegan joint that is surrounded by a world of meat (and it deserves the support). Inside, you will hear uplifting African tribal songs like I did and dream of the promises of a satisfying vegan meal. What will stick with me in this experience was seeing the special-of-the-day sign blown down by the wind, twice; As if nature herself considered compassionate cuisine as commendable but falling flat."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and environmental conscience displayed. I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"I hate to say this because I like supporting vegan restaurants but the food was not good. The vegan burger was just fake meat instead of grains and nuts, which I think it's kinda gross, and I didn't like the taste or texture. The kalebouli did not taste good, somehow, because it was pretty simple. And the corn soup was pretty bad, too, though I think it was the least offensive. Sorry, service and price were good."}
{"text":"Maybe it was just a bad day, but I did not enjoy my mushroom burger. The patty, which I believe is a Boca burger patty, was dry and bland, even with the generous amount of vegan cheese and mushrooms. I've eaten enough veggie burgers in my life to say that it would definitely be better if the patty was made from nuts or hemp seeds rather than obviously just-heated soy meat. Other than that, I've had the Asian quinoa bowl and it was pretty satisfying- plenty of veggies and a good plum sauce. Having seen the lack of health food options in Cleveland, it was quite hard to find something to complain about.   The place can get busy during lunch hour, but what totally pissed me off was when I asked for the cucumber detox smoothie and the lady went \"I can't make a smoothie for you now. We're really busy so we can't make it. You'll have to order another drink\". Not even a sorry or a \"I can make it for you later when it's less crowded\" wth. I mean, if this is supposed to be one of the top vegan places in Cleveland, I'm afraid to imagine what the other places must be like."}
{"text":"Super tasty vegan spot with great service. It's casual and unassuming but definitely my favorite eats in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat vegan food in Cleveland - the menu is large and varied, and the prices are reasonable for a sandwich and side. I am obsessed with the Hula Burger! My husband also loves it and he does not exclusively eat vegan food. If they have Oreo Brownies, you best pounce on one."}
{"text":"Good place! Good food! All Vegan. I had a chicken panini and it was not chicken but pretty good. My vegetarian student I was traveling with was OVER the MOON happy with all the options. The service was good and kind and it was an overall good experience."}
{"text":"thank GOODNESS for this little vegan cafe in the middle of downtown cleveland!  As a California vegan who travels for work, I appreciate the simple things in life, such as friendly vegan cafes!  The eating area is small, so I would recommend calling ahead for reservations if you have a big group, or get take out.  The staff is friendly and knowledgable about the food here. I ate here everyday for dinner for the 4 days that I was in cleveland, and i ordered the soup/sandwich special every time. Although the sandwiches are a bit small, you will feel full after eating.  The cafe also sells smoothies, little prepackaged snacks such as justin pb cups and mojo bars, and baked goods.  The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Never thought I would catch myself saying this bit this place might make me go vegetarian if I lived in Cleveland. Located right downtown across from my office this week, the huge menu made me drool.   Started off with a smoothie that had protien and spinach in it. Mmmmm, talk about delicious. Then had the buffalo dip with pita and celery as an appetizer. But then wolfed down a whole salad (which was really only about 3.5 stars) but man these gals know how to make things look and taste good.   I'm looking forward to going back many times over the next few weeks. Especially if I can't find any other places that have good and healthy food in this town.  10/15/12 Buffalo Chicken Dip = pretty tastey, just gotta get over the fact that it's not real chicken  Soba noodle salad = not bad. a little bland for my taste Blue Flamingo Smoothie + Spinach = the bomb.com  Update: 10/16/12 Carrot + Banana + Spinach + Protein = why did i ever think this was a good idea?!?  Pesto Burger = Heavenly!!!! omg. best pesto ever. i feel bad for anyone near me.  Update: 10/17/12 Asian Rice Bowl = meh ... not bad but the brown rice was pretty dry Green pepper soup of the day = pretty good for healthy food.  Update: 10/18/12 Chicken Quesadilla = pretty good. quite cheesy. I think i'm honestly done with the fake chicken though. I miss the real deal.  Has been quite the marathon so far. I've eaten here at least once everyday this week."}
{"text":"Wow what  a breathe of fresh air. As a vegetarian, it was so refreshing to go to a restaurant and be able to order anything or everything off the menu. I tried the sloppy mo mo sandwich and loved it. I had to fight my meat eating boyfriend off my food cause he thought it was so tasty as well. Highly recommend this gem of a spot. I can't wait to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"I must have walked by this place a thousand times working on the square. Never knew what it was exactly. Came up in a search of \"Asian \" ? Amway, saw the reviews and walked over. The buffalo paninis with a side of black bean and corn salsa was very good. At $7 the price was fair, I think the yelp menu may be outdated. The desert case looked great and they have breakfast items also. There was a gift area too. Cool place and I'm far from vegan."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Really good food, affordable and super healthy.  I felt really good about the experience I had here."}
{"text":"Great menu, food, and service. I would give the place 5 stars, but the restaurant's location makes it hard to get to and find parking unless you're already in the area. The buffalo sauce is not very spicy, but the buffalo panini still rocks!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some healthy food, give the Flaming Ice Cube a try.  We stopped in after a browns game with some friends because one of them is a recovering vegetarian.  They were about to close, but they served us anyway.  As soon as we were seated, they locked the door and several people walked by thinking, 'Well, they must be open because there are people in there eating!' - wrong!  They pulled and pulled on the locked door with shocked facial expressions.  Poor stragglers.    It turned out to be a vegan restaurant, a first for me!  We were promptly served water and the waitress was friendly and informative.  First, we ordered the Warm Artichoke Appetizer, which was really tasty.  The pita bread was really soft.  I ordered a Blue Banana Smoothie and my wife ordered a Flaming Ice Cube Fandango.  Both were delicious and healthy!  I ordered the Mmmushroom Burger, Wifey ordered hummus and pita bread, Friend 1 ordered the Buffalo Panini, and Friend 2 ordered a BBQ Pizza.  I am not a fan of hummus, so my wife's dish was my least favorite.  Did I mention that we cut our entrees into pieces and shared them?  Then I tried my mushroom burger.  It was basically tasteless and dry.  I don't recommend this one.  Then I tried the Buffalo Panini and it certainly had a better flavor than my shroom burger.  Finally, I had two slices of the BBQ pizza and it was the best thing on our table, by FAR!  It was really good and I would order this next time, if there is one.  It was refreshing to eat a somewhat healthy meal for once.  With drink and tip, my wife and I spent $24 for dinner.  Yay!"}
{"text":"I imagined a more diverse and interesting experience than I got here. I was disappointed a place like this topped the list for Cleveland vegan joints because Town Hall or Tommy's are so much better. I did like the artichoke dip, but on the whole, I was underwhelmed by the options here."}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch meeting. The food was delicious and the people working we're very nice. I highly recommend their pesto veggie burger"}
{"text":"Tasty, fresh vegan food.  They offer a wide variety of vegan options including vegan cookies!  It's small and the staff is a little slow but the food makes up for it.    I had the veggie bagel which was pretty good but the highlight was the vegan cream cheese!  WOW!  I don't know what kind they use but I would have been happy with the bagel and just cream cheese.  Also had the vegan pita-dilla (quesadilla in a pita bread) which was superb.  They have daiya cheese - only vegan cheese that's acceptable, really.  If I worked/lived in downtown cleveland I could see myself being a regular."}
{"text":"I had a really good vegan quesadilla, and will be back another time for dessert! They looked good but I was full.  The place seems to be pretty dead around the dinner hour, making it potentially a nice place to get a little work done. I hear it's busier at lunch time.  Nice to have some great vegetarian/vegan options right downtown."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying that everything I tasted here was very yummy. The food was definitely tasty. However, our server apparently had never seen the menu in her life and the atmosphere was abysmal. It reads more like a shady back alley cafe than somewhere you want to go for dinner. Quirky would be a compliment... If you want to eat the food, I recommend carry out. Oh and heads up.... Vegan does not equal healthy here."}
{"text":"This is a very small place with only 5 or 6 tables... over all very good... We ate all vegan and even my daughter cleaned her plate... Everyone got sandwiches, my Buffalo pannini was very good, did have some problems with the order, we all ordered whole wheat and all got white... nothing was written down, but the girls were very nice.... overall a good experience and very tasty, would def come again..."}
{"text":"I am in the Cleveland area for work and always try to find local vegan restaurants to eat at.  My food was good, I had a western burger which had bar-b-que sauce, cheese(imitation), onion and lettuce and a side of a black beans, it was great!  But it wasn't the food that impressed and earned them 5 stars. A man walked in after me, and sat down in front of me. He spoke very quietly and it took him a while to order. Our food came out together, and I was shocked when I saw him give the server his credit card before he started to eat. At first I thought we needed to pay before we ate, sorry I was hungry! She discreetly came back and said his card was declined, he gave her a second card, still had not started eating, and she came back and said that was declined. I could not hear what he said complete but from what I could hear he apologized and said that he only had those two cards and offered to leave. The server said don't worry about it it is ok, enjoy your meal! She even came back and checked on him to see if everything was ok. The compassion and respect she showed to this man is something we rarely see and I can not put in to words how it made me feel.  Shortly after I had finished my meal and went to the counter and said that I would like to pay for my meal and I would like to pay for the man sitting in front of me, and she said it is ok, I already paid for him. I said please let me, and the whole time with a smile, she said that is really nice of you but I already paid. I said that was very nice of you and thank you.   I will try to come back everyday this week to support this establishment. Not only do they have great food, but they care!"}
{"text":"Who am I kidding? I freaking love this place! I have been here at least once a week since posting my original review, and yes, something has gone wrong EVERY SINGLE TIME. But it just doesn't matter.  The staff is really friendly and, like any super-small restaurant, I think they are really doing the best they can with the amount of people they have.  The thing is, the food really is 5-star delicious."}
{"text":"I met my mother and sister here for a lunch on a weekday.  I found the interior nice and comfortable with just enough tables.  I had a good if not overly sweet chai and the Dijon \"Chicken\" panini with potato on the salad.  It was excellent!  Very tasty with good texture and the meat substitute was indistinguishable from the real thing.  I tried my sister's classic veggie burger which with a pinch of salt would have been great.  My sister, who's been vegan for 8 years now and veg for another 10 years before that, said it was the most like eating a real hamburger as she could remember.  Excellent texture, moistness and size for that matter!  My mom's quesadilla was good.  I'm not a huge fan of daiya so if you don't like it that much either I might skip that one.  For dessert I ordered the amazing peanut butter crunch bar and was given what appeared to be a double-serving!  It was big and very very good."}
{"text":"I don't care if you're the biggest carnivore on the planet; you'll still enjoy Flaming Ice Cube. I am by no means a vegan or vegetarian, but I am an avid fan of fresh and organic food. The location is great and the food is even better! If I would have eaten the same amount of food at any other restaurant, I would have felt like I weighed 500 lbs. I left satisfied, full, and feeling energized.  Their veggie burgers are the star of the show, especially the pizza burger. It takes like a vegetarian meatball sub. Their desserts are also delicious. I don't know how they make such excellent cupcakes and brownies without using dairy...it's like some kind of voodoo magic. I don't think their magic is strong enough to convert me into a vegan, but it's definitely strong enough to have me skip a greasy burger joint for fresh vegan cuisine."}
{"text":"I won't say much about this place, because i only got cupcakes and some vegan jerky. I couldn't order lunch as i was getting on the rapid, and i don't wanna share my food with anyone. The menu looked pretty interesting though. The location right on Public Square is amazing. I can't imagine how they are making the rent just selling salads and soups. The lunch crowd has to be the bulk of their business. It's a cute space with a friendly staff. Non vegetarians should not fear this place. They won't burn sage in your face or try to tell your fortune with runes. It's not that hippie dippy kind of place.  It is great that health nuts have this option downtown. So suck up that bus exhaust, beam cell phone rays into your dome, sip some Splenda and enjoy your vegan burger."}
{"text":"Yum-diddly-um, folks.  Noshing on nothin' but grilled veggies all week left me and Husband begging for some yummier eats.  Popped into Cleveland at the end of our OH getaway and directly into the Flaming Ice Cube.  Expectations = blown away.  Just get a bowl of the black bean chili and the quesadilla and thank me later.  Now if only they'd open up shop in Boston..."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants I've ever been to. The ambiance was terrible. I felt like I was inside someone's basement. I could see into the kitchen and it didn't look clean at all. The food was mediocre, and over priced for what it was. The staff was weird, and looked weird. I don't ever want to go back."}
{"text":"Quaint, little place. Food was good but could've used a bit more flavor. We both had wraps, which were decent, but a bit bland. Nice service and I'm a sucker for all vegetarian or vegan places. Every city I visit, I seek them out. This one is above average, just could stand to spice it up a little."}
{"text":"4-  If you're lucky enough to find parking around S. Roadway & Euclid, give this place a try. But be forewarned, it's a vegan restaurant, and you have to buy in to this concept to appreciate the food (i.e. accept that there really is no substitute for a chicken egg), which when mimicking meat can run a bit bland, but in the form of interesting veggie and fruit dishes, can be quite delectable.    I'd recommend the sunshine salad and the lemonade. I also had a side of carrot & raisin salad, which really surprised and delighted my tastebuds.  Meanwhile, the pizza burger was filling, but nothing special.   And a thumbs up to the staff for their effort and enthusiasm.  Give these kids a break, fellow Yelpers!  They are obviously trying very hard."}
{"text":"So I don't give out 5 stars frivolously, but this place deserves it. Everything I had (summer rolls, vegan pizza burger and chocolate chip cookies) was delicious. The service was great and the waitress helped me narrow down the never ending yummy looking options on the menu. They even gave me a smoothie sample while I waited.  Next time I'm in Cleveland, I'll definitely stop back in. I may even be coming for dinner today."}
{"text":"We visited last week for my best friend's birthday and the experience wasn't that great. We waited forever for someone to take our drink order and were told that they didn't have half of the items listed on their menu online. We were served warm tap water and for some reason they were being super stingy with the ice because when we asked for extra for our warm waters we were given a cup with about 5 cubes in it... wtf? The decor doesn't really fit the style and they are trying to go for the whole \"intimate\" dining experience but you actually just feel cramped and like you are in a generic family diner. Definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"I'll be honest. I'm a meat-and-potatoes kinda guy. I've pingponged all over the place with the idea of whether or not I should be a vegetarian, but at the end of the day, I just could never wake up and know that I'd never be able to eat another burger at B Spot, the delicious chicken wings at The Greenhouse Tavern, or one of Sheila F's juicy roasts. I Maybe I'm just selfish and weak-willed, but in any case, that's my take on the matter.   That said, if my doctor ever came up to me and told me I'd die within a month unless I quit eating meat cold turkey, the Flaming Ice Cube would be a place that would make the transition light years easier. I've had all sorts of vegetarian food, and this was by far the best. The quality of food at the Flaming Ice Cube was amazing and I was totally impressed by everything I ate. If I were a vegetarian, I'd happily eat here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner...and if they were open later, for Fourth Meal too.  My SIL is an ardent vegetarian, and after her and the rest of my in-laws sacrificed a lot of time and money to come up and watch me graduate from law school, I wanted to do something that she'd enjoy doing and something that would make her happy. Many times, she winds up eating something not so great while the rest of us feast, and I always feel bad and wish that wasn't the case. Earlier in the year, my law school had a Wellness Fair at which they brought therapy dogs and other organizations to the school; one of these organizations was The Flaming Ice Cube. I forget what exact sample they distributed, but I remember that it was delicious, and I also remember thinking to myself that this would be a great place to take my SIL.   We had a variety of different things to eat. There were several great options on the menu and I had a hard time narrowing my choice down to just one item! I had an Italian Panini, Sheila F. and my SIL had chick'n salad sandwiches, my FIL had a Buffalo Panini, and my MIL had a bowl of soup. The Buffalo Panini was hands down my favorite menu item--it was spicy, creamy, and yummy. My Italian Panini was good, I definitely could tell the difference between the veggie meat and the real meat that's used at Subway, but it wasn't enough to make me not want to order it again. We also had Summer Rolls as an appetizer. I've had these at other restaurants, but the Flaming Ice Cube's summer rolls were much, much better. The peanut sauce that accompanied them was really, really good too.  They had a variety of veggie bars for sale in the store, as well as other items as well.  If you like to people watch, try to get the front table with a spectacular view of Public Square and downtown Cleveland. We had a great view of the Soldiers and Sailors Monument.  Also, another reviewer said there's no bathroom here. There is a bathroom here--just ask, and they'll take you to it. They probably don't want people coming in off the street, using the bathroom, and leaving without enjoying their great food.   All in all, whenever I need to take vegetarians, vegans, or simply anyone who wants a break from the norm out to eat, I'll make a beeline to the Flaming Ice Cube. I was blown away by the quality and taste of the food, and it's yet another fantastic addition to the diverse restaurant scene here in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I had their cupcake here and I could tell it was a vegan cupcake. This made me extremely sad because I had such high hopes for this place. It is such a cool idea and it adds so much character to the area.   When I return, maybe I can try one of their meals and it will be much better!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have do downgrade my earlier review. I have loved the food  and the staff at the Flaming Ice Cube for sometime now. but, recently I acquired food poisoning from one of their takeout side dishes. I reported it to them and they felt that since no one else had reported being ill I was mistaken at why I was ill. I have no doubt to why I was ill since it was the only thing I ate that afternoon, and felt they missed an opportunity to review their procedures to stop this from happening again. Unfortunately, I do not feel comfortable eating there again"}
