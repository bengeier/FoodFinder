{"text":"First time at Area 51. Both the pulled pork and brisket were great. I recommend the mixed BBQ sauce. Great new local business. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious pulled pork barbecue sandwiches. Owner was really nice too."}

{"text":"I feel like I've had a random off experience with this place.  We are regulars at Rowdy's BBQ further up 51, and decided to try this place (which has taken over my former hair stylist's salon), though not because of their Area 51 alien theme and bright colors.  Ordered near closing time (about an hour prior).  The woman taking our order was extremely pleasant and the process was quick with food being ready in 15 minutes (we live 1 minute away).  Chose pork BBQ sandwich with beans as a side, and a BBQ brisket with mac and cheese--both regular (as opposed to spicy).  The sandwiches weren't labeled, and looked nearly identical.  Had to taste test to tell them apart.  The BBQ sauce was slightly tangy and sweet, and I could have done with more for my pork, but that's a preference and not a fault.  The pork was warm and actually tasted amazing--buttery with good smoky flavor.  My problem was the actual composition of the sandwich. The bottom bun was soaked in fat/juice from the pork that it was inedible, making a sandwich a moot point.  The smoked beans were a glob of thick, mashed beans. They looked to be homemade (at some point), but the sauce was so thick, gritty, and salty that it was not enjoyable.  The mac and cheese was also mushy and flavorless, but the toddler was happy with that.  The cornbread was sweet, but dry, though the highlight of dinner.  We'll probably give it another try, as every place is entitled to an off day, as the reviews of this place are much more favorable than my experience."}
{"text":"Yelp says this place is open. Drove here on a Tuesday at 3pm and they are closed. Disappointed."}
{"text":"First off, I do not like leaving bad reviews! I would never want to hurt someone's business. I am more leaving this comment for the owners to help them out! I ordered the wings, and I ate one. It was kinda pink, which weirded me out but idk how that affects other people. But....... I then noticed some of the wings had hair on them :( I know this happens but I was just so grossed out and completely lost my appetite. We ordered a few things, most of which were cold. They only have two sauce choices which don't have a lot of flavor. I don't want to criticize the people working to make money. But if you added more sauce choices, and made sure the food was hot and the wings didn't have hair on them . I seriously felt sick for hours after that. The hair all around the wings was just so gross and unsettling to me! And it wasn't just a few hairs! Good luck, but sorry, I was disappointed :/"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! All of the sides were really great but I can't get over the ribs themselves. The perfect balance of being tender fall off the bone combined with a chewy seasoned smoked top layer. Love the sauce too, not too spicy so you still enjoy the flavor of the meat itself. The place is extremely clean too! We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"The BBQ is top notch! Everything is available in two flavors, regular and spicey, so it fits a wide variety of taste buds. They'll even mix the two if you ask!   The brisket sandwiches are huge and messy. You're gonna need to use a fork and knife.   The ribs have a rub that is so good you don't need a sauce, but the sauce is too good to pass up!  Now for the negative...  SKIP THE SIDES!!!   If you're in the mood for coleslaw, this is not your place. It tastes more like broccoli salad with too much mayo.  KFC's soggy mac & cheese looks hornet next to their little cup of mushrooms w cheese sauce.  The cornbread is store bought, COLD, and stale.  But what was most disappointing was the baked beans. Even canned pintos heated in their wonderful sauces would have been OK, but instead I got (what I suspect to be) knock off canned Bush's baked beans! Disappointing.  The location is horrible. Their position on 51 makes it difficult to get to the shop.  Would I go back?  Definitely! The business is still new, and will improve with time. I hope they are very successful.  If you're gonna check it out, check your bank account balance! This is homemade food, at skyrise prices. Portion size and taste doesn't match up with quality and price point. I'll still go back, but not often."}
{"text":"My family has been waiting for this place to open. Two of us are HUGE barbecue fans. I was out running an errand and happened to notice that it was open. I ran my errand and then stopped in. The gentleman who owns the restaurant was very nice. E went over the menu with me. I ordered 2 Pulled Pork sandwiches. You can get mild or spicy. The mild was mine and the spicy was for my son. I also got a side of mac n cheese and a side of Coke slaw. We tried the coleslaw first and it was very tasty. The flavor leans toward the taste of KFC's coleslaw. The mac n cheese was very cheesy and silky. The sandwiches were huge!!!  There was meat piled high on both of them. The PTL was very tender and falls apart. You can tell that it has been smoked low and slow for hours. The ingredients used in the BBQ sauce come together to make it very flavorful. It was a great texture and consistency. We will definitely be going back to try the beef brisket and the pork chops."}
{"text":"It was decent food, but not great. There was just one guy running the place (the person apparently being out for surgery). He was brusque, but not rudely so. The food was fairly cheap, and showed up fast. Unfortunately, it just didn't do much more me. It wasn't badly cooked, but the brisket, the pork chops, and ribs just tasted like meat that had been slathered with barbecue sauce afterwards, and said sauce tasted like generic barbecue sauce from the store. The baked beans were probably the best part of the meal, and that's not what I generally expect from a BBQ place."}
{"text":"Big BBQ fans here. We've tried barbecue all over and this place it an awesome place to taste. Reasonable prices (I recognize that a lot of BBQ places are pricey) and tasty.  We paid $30 for a sampler and split it between 2 people. We got ribs, pulled pork, brisket, and wings and mac n cheese, beans (smoked) potato salad, and cornbread. We enjoyed the selection and taste.  Some nit-picky things are; the brisket was shredded not sliced and the membrane was still on the ribs. These are not the culinary norm when it comes to barbecue but didn't affect the taste too much.   My personal favorite was the ribs. My least favorite was the brisket, (but my husband liked it so... to each their own).   Oh and by the way the owners were AWESOME NICE! I love giving money to a place where you can actually meet and talk to the owner and get to know them. Where they treat you like a person while you support their business."}
{"text":"I am always looking to try a new BBQ joint, so there was no hesitation when Area 51 was suggested. Unfortunately, we arrived for dinner on the late side, so the meats were getting low, but still I got to try both the pulled pork and brisket.  There are two flavors of sauce - regular and spicy. I would have preferred if the sauces were served on the tables and not doused on the meat. I personally like to taste the meat more than the sauce. Not sure if they would serve the sauce on the side if asked, but if you are like me it would be better to ask.    Since they were out of pulled pork after the others in my party ordered, I ordered the brisket. I was expecting more of a sliced meat, but it was offered pulled too. And the menu offered sandwiches only - so I asked for no bun. It would be nice to see a meat platter instead of just sandwiches. The brisket was good, albeit a bit oily. Again - I would assume that the oil was because the meats were low and we got the last available. I would love to go back and try again - a bit earlier in the day to be more fair on the meat quality.  Cornbread was good - no complaints. Mac n cheese was gone so the only other side we sampled was potato salad. No complaints there.  I look forward to giving it another try - hopefully an update to this review will be posted soon."}
{"text":"Do not listen to Ashley S These wings are out of this world (no pun intended) fall off the bone, they may be a bit more then other places but they are worth every penny. I really want to try the other options there, only thing else that would be amazing would be to have fries. Btw the Mac n cheese is also really really good"}
{"text":"Love this place.  I always get the pulled pork, you just can't go wrong with it.   Love the BBQ sauce!  The ribs and brisket are great too!"}
