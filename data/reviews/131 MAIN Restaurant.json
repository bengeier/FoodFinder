{"text":"Excellent service and experience all around. Sometimes you can tell the quality of a restaurant by how they handle the simplist things.  Their prime rib sandwich with au jus dip was perfect and tender. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"131 Main consistently has good, quality food and service.   The menu offers a variety of dishes without being overwhelming.   Their Awesome Roast Beef sandwich is, well, awesome, and their salads are always great.   I love their panfried flounder, pork chops and prime rib too.   I've had their dessert only one time - the Banana Cream Pie - and it was delicious!    131 Main is a great place to eat in the Charlotte area - consistenly good food, attentive servers and a low-key environment."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat!!!  Nice atmosphere, great service, and consistantly good food!  If going for lunch the roast beef sandwich is truly awesome, for dinner the ribs can't be beat.  If you get lucky the loaded potato soup will be featured.  I highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.  Wonderful date night spot. They also have a nice outdoor deck with a fire pit that is really nice in the fall."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to celebrate our 40th anniversary and a friend said 131 main was a really good place for dinner--expensive but good we were told.  I hardly know where to begin to describe how disappointed the entire evening there was.  We went on a Sunday evening so we're not talking about a crowded restaurant.  First I'm trying to figure out where the word \"classy\" describes 131 Main--there were no white tablecloths and the seating was in a booth.   We were seated right away and then we waited and waited and waited.  Finally, my husband grabbed a waiter who was walking by and asked if someone would be along soon to take our order.  There didn't seem to be any one person assigned to our table.  The waiter took our drink order and I was expecting a good Mojito--it was very ordinary and lacked any kind of special presentation--no garnish.  Then another person showed up to take our meal order and we were astonished to find that  the meal was nothing more than a steak and a side of mashed potatoes--if we wanted bread or a salad then that was extra.  To add insult to injury both steaks arrived undercooked (we said medium and we got med. rare) so back they went to the kitchen and we waited some more.  We never received a \"sorry about that\" or acknowledgement of the bad service.  Also the menu said the filet was 8 oz. but it seemed rather small.  We decided to skip the dessert there and go elsewhere so when we finally got the check we were surprised to see that it was somebody else's check and we had to wait again until someone brought us the correct check.  The food was quite ordinary and way overpriced and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"There is nothing bad on the menu at 131 Main.  It isn't fancy or particularly inventive but every menu item is good. I haven't had everything but i've been there enough with people to know.  The veggie burger is one of the best I have had anywhere. Cast Iron Cornbread is yummy.  Service is really good.  I have never been a server, for good reason, but I think if you order something then the waiter who took the order should recall who ordered it.  Certainly there is some system for this in the waiter handbook.  The team style service at 131 has this down pat!  Theres no \"Who had the hot dog with fries\". When you called in advance to get Sunday's soup on a Thursday and ask for 13 seperate checks and they just smile at you like you are their favorite customers, you have good service.  131 is a safe bet.  Your food and service will be good."}
{"text":"Very good food !  1/2 off wine on Tuesdays !   Great atmosphere !"}
{"text":"Good food.  I had the prime rib (12 oz) and it was above average.  The salad with blue cheese vinaigrette dressing was excellent.  My wife had the crab cake salad.  The crab cakes were very good.  The atmosphere was ok but a little hectic and noisy (Friday night so I guess that's to be expected).  Don't expect a quiet romantic dinner though. If you need glasses be sure to bring them, it's VERY dark inside.  Service was great with very attentive and pleasant servers.  Portions were sizable so we didn't save room for desert.  Price was a little high for what we got.  Will probably go back but only occasionally.  Overall good restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food, food. Glorious food! If grilled zucchini is a side, get it! Wedge salad with grilled chicken, roast beef sandwich, roasted chicken... I've never had anything I didn't like. Save room for the best banana cream pie I've ever had!   Staff owns their job. Great atmosphere. A little pricy, but the ingredients are extremely fresh."}
{"text":"I've been to 131 Main for lunch twice recently and had great experiences both times. One day I went with a group of 8 and another day with a group of 4 and was seated immediately both times. The service has been consistently great. Their servers work as a team, so rather than having one waiter or waitress for the entire meal you'll likely be served by multiple people. In my experience this translates to shorter waits for refills, which is always a plus!  The restaurant has an upscale feel but is still quite casual during lunch. I'm not sure if this is the case during dinner service. It's pricey, so I would consider it more appropriate special occasions rather than a regular lunch or dinner spot.   Appetizers - the skillet cornbread is unbelievable and came highly recommended by a friend who used to work at the former Dilworth location of 131 Main. The double dip (guacamole, pimento cheese, and salsa with tortilla chips) is also a nice starter.   Entrees - the Cobb salad with Caesar dressing ($16) was the perfect lunch portion and the cornbread croutons are seriously next level. I've also tried the prime rib sandwich ($19, recommended by my friend as well) and was a little bit underwhelmed. The fries that came with it, however, were perfect seasoned and totally delicious! I've seen a number of reviews mention the crab cakes, so I'll definitely be back to try those!"}
{"text":"Purchased a $100 gift certificate for my son and his fiance and made reservations for 8 PM 7/13/12. They arrived early and excited. They never got seated....  Couples arrived after them, received buzzers, and seated.  They approached the desk 4 times and ignored 3.  After 45 minutes they left very disappointed. Was it because they looked young? Was the staff overwhelmed? I have been there several times without issue but this was most disappointing to hear; especially celebrating a special event for them.  I have reached out to the restaurant and put it in writing to inform the management of the experience and how they were treated.  UPDATE: I recieved a call today from the GM and he expressed his deep regrets for the incident.  Additionally, he is sending a matching gift certificate, provided his cell phone number so that we could make to make a follow up reservation, and that he would like to visit the table while we are there.  I thought that he is doing his best to turn around a bad experience."}
{"text":"Food and service were outstanding.  A very unique take on their shrimp and grits, I like the asparagus touch, well done.  I thought the restaurant was very clean and I was really impressed.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"131 Main is wonderful in every aspect, including the wait. Don't misinterpret that, usually the wait is rather lengthy. But they distract you with the open kitchen, where you watch the cooks glaze the best baby back ribs I've ever had. Seriously, they're out of this world. Once you're seated, it just keeps getting better. The service is incredible. The waiters are very professional, helpful, and quick.   As for the food, it's amazing. Definitely get some appetizers. The deviled eggs and cornbread are both to amazing. Order anything on the menu and you'll be satisfied. Personally, I would go for the ribs or the crab cakes, but everything is good. Save room for dessert, or don't and order anyway, because their keylime pie is to die for. While it is a little pricey, it's definitely worth it. Save it for a special occasion if you must, but definitely try it out."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, attentive staff, lovely ambiance, and a consistently great dining experience.  Their salads, soups, and cornbread are particularly yummy.  Great location, always parking, and an upscale environment, yet really comfortable and it's fine to wear shorts & a t-shirt.  A really special place."}
{"text":"I love 131 main and I have honestly never had a bad meal here.   The one time were there was an issue with getting our food out and on time to our party(waiters fault) the manager comped the whole table of 8.   Top notch food with top notch service you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"They struggle to cook a steak properly here. You will get medium rare/rare even if you order well done or medium well."}
{"text":"I've been to this location the (closed) Dilworth location and the one in Asheville.  131 Main is one of my favorite upscale restaurants. The staff and food are both top notch.  The salmon, ribeye and shrimp & grits are all favorites.  1/2 price wine night is a great deal if you just want to go to the bar and have a few apps and drinks.  Solid date spot."}
{"text":"Service - Superior. Friendliness - Superior. Atmosphere - Superior. Quality Food - Superior and fresh.  I had the Shrimp & Grits = Delicious! Literally cleaned my plate. My bf had the rib-eye with potatoes cooked medium-well.    He let me have a little taste. Let's just say, I will be back to have the rib-eye amongst other things. We took our time eating bite by bite to savor the flavor.   We also met new friends from the Netherlands who are regulars. We are excited to have met new friends.  We had the key lime pie. My bf is a key lime pie connoisseur. It was fresh and made with their own handmade crust. It was fantastic by his standards and he said this is the best. He had dined at the restaurant before and had it then. He said the taste was consistent. He even joked and said that if it were between me and the pie, it would be the pie. Lol It was that good.  The Manager Tom is outstanding manager. He even came to our table to apologize for the delay of our appetizer and provided further expectations. We really appreciated that. A little goes a long way and 131 Main has mastered to art of quality culinary and customer service. In my opinion, this is why restaurants fall short most of the time. 5 stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent upscale dining in Lake Norman. About $50 per couple if you have a glass of wine and 1 app. Everything is cooked fresh to order. No frozen stuff. Wine selection by the glass is great too.  This is a low-light, swanky, upscale restaurant, so I wouldn't recommend for large groups. But the bar is Hoppin!   Try the pimento cheese/guacamole appetizer. It's addicting and homemade!  The soups change each day and the loaded potato is my favorite (Wednesday)  The Prime Rib is really really delicious and huge, so be really hungry, or share. Comes with the usual stuff. If you aren't that hungry, get the roast beef sandwich with tiny fries. It's extremely delicious and we share that with the pimento  app and a salad.  The place has some neat sides. Try the cornbread or the roasted veggies. I heard the Ahi Tuna Salad was really good.   I've never made it to dessert!!! So stuffed!"}
{"text":"Nice place.  I find the menu to be too limited.  The food is good if what's on the menu happens to be what you want to eat.  Not much there to pique my interest.  Service is very good."}
{"text":"Fantastic and well run restaurant with excellent service.  Food is very well prepared and executed...the only complaint is that the menu is very small with limited offerings I feel.  More steak and seafood choices I feel would take this restaurant to the next level.    *  Service:  A *  Decor:  B+ *  Food Preparation:  A *  Quality of Ingredients:  B+ *  Value:  A *  Menu:  C"}
{"text":"This place is a excellent restaurant and a must-go for those visiting the Cornelius, NC area! We were seated and served almost immediately. The menu has many great choices, that range from seafood to chicken to beef. We went for a birthday and they allow you to choose from a couple of desserts with a candle on it! Magnificent restaurant, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Amazing food - Amazing service - Amazing atmosphere! We love going to 131 Main as often as possible! You cannot pass up the cornbread appetizer! I've never had a single item off of the menu here that I did not rave about. Even their veggie burger is the best one I have ever eaten. Love it!"}
{"text":"Went here two weeks ago with another couple. Not what it used to be. Nice place but service was sub-par. Two of the 4 dishes had cold proteins and all of our sides were cold. Server did bring back hot proteins but the scallops were undercooked.  Never got drink refills. My wife and I ordered a desert to share and told server that if I liked it I may have to order one for myself. but she never came back to see how I liked it.  Not a fan of the \"primary\" server approach - lots of staff scurrying around but didn't lead to better service.  I saved room for desert and then didn't find anything that interested me. They need a good chocolate desert."}
{"text":"My significant other and I went here for restaurant week and had such a fantastic experience.  The food was perfect and the service was even better.  After each course our server would take away our plates, box up our leftovers and at the end of the meal put them in a to go bag for us.  The portions are generous, for which I was thankful because they were great leftovers the next day.  We had cast iron cornbread, shrimp and grits, prime rib, and key lime pie.  I highly recommend any of those items.  On Tuesdays bottles of wine are 50% off and appetizers are $5.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed about our last dinner experience.  The menu has been revised and not for the better.  The restaurant previously had a \"gluten free\" menu and now they don't?  I asked the waiter about this change and he could not explain why nor was he knowledgeable about how the food is prepared.  Very difficult place to eat if you have food allergies.  The prices have gone up, menu selections are more limited, and the service is poor.  We ordered a $25 + take out dinner entree before placing our dinner order for 4 people and the take out order was delayed (said another customer took our order?) and we had to remind the waiter about the side order not in the take out bag???  We would not recommend this restaurant to other diners now."}
{"text":"Taylor are server was amazing!!  Chopped salad was delicious! The presentation of the food was great.  My son got the filet and he loved it.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner last night at 131 Main. The pork chop was flinstone size meaning I'm pretty sure my plate was tipping over. my boyfriends surf & turf was delicious. The sauce with the crab cake was Devine. We had wonderful service by Adam & we highly recommend anyone to come here for a great dinner with friends or a quiet romantic dinner with your honey. Oh and the chocolate brownie gooeyness dessert was a perfect finish."}
{"text":"Terrible Value. Price was 80 for lunch today that was not even mediocre. I feel robbed. We had fish tacos, grilled artichoke and wife had veggie burger. No dessert  and only 1 glass wine each plus my coffee. Not even 1 star. Save your money. Best value at Lake Norman is exit 28 off I-77 new restaurant \"Port City Club\". Did Valentines Day dinner and it was phenomenal food, service and atmosphere. View of the lake was icing on the cake. Unbelievable food."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the Cornelius / Mooresville corridor.  The corn bread is out of this world and the ahi tuna salad is excellent."}
{"text":"The best fall off the bone ribs you can eat.  Also try the roast beef"}
{"text":"I see more positive reviews than not so please heed my advice this place is not worth the $$$ Every table full so I assumed that the food was first rate, not even close.  I ordered the ribs accompanied by coleslaw and french fries.  The ribs were mostly bone so I had little meat to eat for $23. French fries were same as steak and shakes and never would I recommend putting crushed peanuts on coleslaw terrible.  How do they get away with putting nuts in their sides without warning of peanut allergies. Diners beware both side dishes with our meals had nuts. House wines lowest price $8. When we dined bottles were half price but I drink white and spouse drinks red low end price $50!!  Will not return. Should have returned to Mickey  and Mooch where I know the food is worth the price."}
{"text":"My husband had the danish ribs and he loved them!  We also had the cornbread appetizer which was HUGE and delicious!  The service was excellent.  The portions were ridiculous!  Including the desserts!  I would definitely recommend this restaurant and I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Simply put, I've never had less than an ideal experience at 131. This visit was less formal; apps and sandwich at the bar with a nice bottle of wine. Service staff from front door to bar an everyone in between was great. 50 minute wait for a dining table and our food was delivered in under 10 minutes. Fresh food, great space."}
{"text":"The best ribeye in town!  I like the marinated one the most!  The two can dine is a great price!"}
{"text":"My wife and I driving up from Key West - tired and just wAnting something good to eat.  Received a free \"appetizer\" from Hampton Inns and decided to go to 131 Main Street.  Wonderfull!!!  We had the \"corn bread\" free appetizer- delicious.  Ordered the filet with \"loaded\" mashed potatoes and shared.  It was fantastic!!! Service was outstanding and food delicious.  We will come again."}
{"text":"Truly disappointing.  Weak service and the food was poorly executed.  Three waiters that didn't know the menu or ingredients contained in the dishes.  The manager on duty was not helpful.  We will never return."}
{"text":"Have been here many times and the food is consistently excellent.  The roast beef, prime rib and wedge salad are family favorites.  Everything I've tried here is fresh, well prepared and the service is great.  One of our favorite places for lunch or dinner. Prices are reasonable and justified."}
{"text":"Great lunch menu - I had a great spinach salad last week (can remember the name of it).  Dinner menu is good too but somewhat limited."}
{"text":"New favorite spot {so far} in the area!! We will be moving from California to nearby Huntersville in June and made a trip to see our new home. Noticed this gem on a previous trip and after reading the reviews were looking forward to giving it a try. It did not disappoint!!    The hubby and I were delayed for our 7pm reservation due to an appointment taking longer than expected. Made a quick call as soon as possible {10 minutes after our reservation time} and thankfully they were able to accommodate us a bit later, no problem! {Loved that but we may not have been so lucky on the weekend and I would understand why if so.}   When we arrived at 7:25 the staff greeted us and we were seated within 5 minutes of our arrival. Loved the vibe inside.   Started with the double dip and it was yummy!   For my main dish I got the Shrimp and Grits and it was absolutely DELICIOUS!! Creamy, savory goodness for certain! Will definitely get it next time and I'm Iooking forward to it for sure!!  My husband ordered the pork chop dinner. He enjoyed the mashed potatoes and said the pork chop was cooked well but after one bite of my dish he was ruined and wished he had ordered it. It was just so much more flavorful. He too is looking forward to having the Shrimp and Grits when we go back.   Our server Victoria was awesome and all the staff we encountered were helpful, kind and efficient doing their thing to clear dirty dishes and refill our drinks.   The restaurant was full and felt lively enough but at the same time there were tables available and open on the weekday that we were there. I would highly recommend this spot of you are looking for a nice date night or girls night out!!"}
{"text":"Had high expectations when my foodie friends invited me to dinner here. Service was fantastic. Prices were high for what you get. Entrees from 23-35 not including veggies in some cases. Not including salads. Waitress gave great description of special and it convinced me to order it. It was pricey, but boy did it sound amazing.  Very disappointed when it arrived.  The plate looked so empty that my foodie friend actually called over waitress to see if something was missing.  Boring looking piece of fish (tasted ok but zero presentation), ceramic container of sauce, that's it. Seriously. The fish was from Ecuador so maybe the $32 included airfair. Paid extra for asparagus which came on its own plate. Wish I had taken a photo. Seriously boring plate and just OK taste. On the plus side, scallops were delicious with so much other food and sauce on plate that it wasn't finished. Crab cakes delish, but again, boring plate -- 2 crabcakes in sauce. Other dishes looked (and were) filling.  I left hungry. And disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the NC Rainbow Trout with chilled quinoa salad and key lime pie for dessert.  All did not disappoint.   I had the Pearfection as my cocktail and it was Amazing!!! Will definitely be my usual when I go."}
{"text":"I'm happy to say that 131 Main went to great lengths to rectify our previous dining experience. I commend the GM for excellent customer service, and applaud 131 Main for taking action to improve the customer experience. The food is excellent, and I would definitely recommend 131 as a go to destination for high dining or casual conversation!!"}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed.  The food is fresh and well prepared service is excellent!!"}
{"text":"Food was overall excellent. We had our two boys and they were helpful in providing something off menu for our oldest. Only negative was the asparagus that my wife and father in law got was slightly overcooked. Would have given 5 stars except for that. Service was fast and efficient and server was very pleasant. We went on a Thursday and the food was out pretty quick. Drinks were well poured (strong but not too strong). Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Just when I thought it couldn't get better.... it did. Our server April was outstanding and went above and beyond to make our dinner with friends extra special. Not to mention how delicious our meals were. Thank you 131 for taking such good care of your patrons!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic dining experience! This is a great place to treat those in your life that you love and want to spoil a bit! We took my family who was visiting from out of town and had an exceptional time. Lauren, our waitress was outstanding, knowledgeable and just an all around pro. My husband and father had the famous BBQ ribs with the Asian coleslaw and smashed potatoes. I am not one to order ribs because it messes up my nails (haha), but forget about it... I'm totally ordering the ribs next time! Whoa! The meat fell off the bone and the smokey flavor was a dream come true! My BBQ chicken was delicious, but still didn't come close to the ribs. My mother's crab cakes were a little fishy, but Lauren immediately took them off our bill, which was exceptionally kind and just plain awesome customer service. The appetizer was a hit as well! Order the three dips (house-made salsa, pimento cheese, and guacamole) with homemade tortilla chips! Mmmm.... Outstanding! This upscale, yet casual spot is a must for delicious food, exceptional service, and serves up deliciously, smokey ambiance in a very good way!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing every time--food, service, atmosphere...one of our favorites in the area. Miss the Main Event option..."}
{"text":"READ THIS: Took 3 other friends here and it was my first time at any Main location. My bill was way too high for the quality of the food, the presentation, and service. Was 1:30PM on a Sunday. Not very many people there. My friends split a 'Main' salad like they had done many times before. When they got it, it was 1/3 the size it normally was. It looked like a baby portion on each of their plates. They asked for the special croutons to be placed on the side..well, Main forgot the croutons altogether and we had to remind them. The croutons were the point of ordering the salad. Beer selection was lame. I had to get a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale in a bottle because they didnt carry other many fine quality beers that last years in normal non-refrigerated storage. It was $4 for one tiny bottle. Can you believe that? For that mediocre brand? I wouldn't mind if the beer was 10% alcohol but man, it wasn't! Why not some Belgian Ales like St Bernardus or some Chimay? For the price to eat here the beer selection was seriously lacking. My wife got the Thai Steak salad, I believe it was called. She hated it. It had like 3 or 4 small pieces of meat in it..the rest was a glob of noodles. She immediately complained of stomach pain and sat on a public toilet at Northlake Mall several times as soon as we left there. I think it was around 4 times. It ruined her shopping day...and complained the rest of the day about her stomach. I was pissed. I ordered the grilled salmon with cold rice side. It was very small and as soon as the server plopped it down I was angry at the cost/size ratio. For a $25 piece of fish it was a very sad joke on me. If it would have come with a free amusement park ticket or a 30 min spa massage, then I would not have any complaints..but it didn't. I've caught bigger fish in a creek when I was 8 years old than that fish on my plate. I told my wife that I felt robbed. If someone had laid that food on a table somewhere and said you can have this for $143.36 (my bill), I would laugh and then punch them in the face for insulting me. My friends and I all could have went to Carowinds all day and all night for that bill. My friends didn't even drink any alcohol! So that didn't run up the tab. They had 1 tea and 1 hot lemon water. I had one beer..what a disgrace for a \"relaxing good meal\" - I left 131 Main in Cornelius pissed off and robbed. I'll never go back to another one. Why would you? Are you crazy?"}
{"text":"Have been going to 131 for a couple years now and it started out with consistently good service and above average food. I think 131 is slipping and our last meal was about the same as going to an Applebee's or Chili's. Our cornbread was over cooked and rock hard. My salmon was just \"ok\" and the burger was average. The biggest disappointment was the banana cream pie. The filling had absolutely no flavor and it was drowned in equally flavorless whipped cream. We always want to give a good place a break as any place can have a bad day. Unfortunately, the trend seems to be toward the bad. Really hope they can turn it around."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! It keeps me coming back for more. Now that I have tried so many things, I have a harder task when it comes to chosing what to order. I love their salads and my fav is the ahi tuna - YUM! Plus, I really like the roast beef sandwich. My go-to entree is the salmon on a plank with either the wild rice salad or the kale salad - YUM! We had a delicious special the other night: grilled bass with crabmeat and a lemony sauce - YUM! The baby back ribs are great, too! There is a smallish but fun bar area and your choice of booth or table seating, very attentive staff and a good wine list. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Of all the restaurants in the Lake Norman area, 131 Main is in the top three for a dinner out with that special someone.   The food is VERY good and the staff personnel are friendly, polite and helpful.   The décor is tasteful.   There is a very good wine selection.   And the prices are not overboard for this level of dining.     My ONLY issue is it can be loud when there are a lot of diners.  Perhaps some sound adsorbing materials may help?"}
{"text":"Went here for supper after a day at the racetrack. Great marinated ribeye, cooked perfectly! Everything else was way too good also. The wait staff was excellent, and treated us awesome even though we were under dressed. Well worth it."}
{"text":"I absolutely enjoyed my time at 131 Main!   I had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant for the first time a few weeks ago and was very impressed. The staff was attentive and friendly and the food was impeccable. The drinks were pretty good too. I had a margarita (or two) while my date sipped on a glass (or two) of Merlot.   The ambiance was decent, dark, and personable. I would recommend this restaurant for a date or night out.   The only complaint I had was the temperature of the restaurant. I went on a cool fall evening and it was really chilly inside. Bring a jacket!"}
{"text":"The food here has huge portions so get ready to take half home :-) it has a great intimate atmosphere indoor and nice roadside outdoor dining area with fire pit. One thing that I m not a big fan of is the oil and grease in the food. The food is very rich and I think it's a love or hate to lots people."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  For an appetizer the deviled eggs and cornbread can't be beat.  Last time we went my husband got the ribs and they were the best ribs in the world.  I will be going back for them as soon as possible.  The only downside for me was the banana cream pie.  I ordered it once before and loved it, but last time it was mediocre at best.  That is a small thing though.   Bottom line- this is a place where the food is so good that I feel like it is money well spent when I leave there, no regrets."}
{"text":"I went to 131 Main with a group of 4 other people. We shared the pimento cheese/ guac appetizer and then all get different entree dishes. It all tasted good at the time; however, I woke up the next morning and vomited for approximately 11 hours. Upon arriving at the hospital to be treated for severe food poisoning induced dehydration, I found out that every other person in my group of 4 had also been admitted to the hospital!  How neat!  131 Main declined our insurance claim, stating that there wasn't enough evidence to prove we had food poisoning...  (5 people shared an appetizer. 5 people ate different meals for the rest of the day.  5 people went to the hospital.  My gut tells me that it just might have been the pimento/ guac.)  While 131 Main didn't find sufficient evidence to prove we had food poisoning, I, however, did find sufficient evidence to note that 131 Main is an extremely well-run restaurant with rigorous kitchen sanitation protocols and management that really looks out for the customer (joking). This place is terrible."}
{"text":"While visiting family we stopped at 131 for dinner.  It is nicely decorated and has a great atmosphere.  We went for the artichoke appetizer, which we have yet to find or see at any other restaurant.  It is so delicious!  I had the soup and salad for dinner.  Both were also delicious.  The soup was a creamy corn chowder.  It was unlike any I have had prior.  Thick and full of veggies and spice.  The salad was a great sized portion.  The dressing was a blue cheese vinaigrette.  It was just right.  I tried a few shoe string fries and the slaw from my fellow diners.  They were also great.  I wish they had a side samplers platter you could make a meal just with their delicious sounding sides!  Overall it was great meal.  The prices are a bit high, but maybe typical for that area.  I am not sure.   I hear if you eat at the bar they have good specials."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had reservations and were immediately seated upon arrival. Our waitress was friendly from beginning to end however her service declined by the end of our time there. Other waitress/waiters came to refill our drinks and clear some dishes off the table for more room. The food was fresh and hot but I did not care for the cedar salmon.  The salad quinoa was good especially with the tomatoes. My boyfriend had the 14 oz sterling steak which was delicious! Overall, service was just ok. Nothing to get excited about"}
{"text":"Really great food! Even the croutons on the salad were delicious! The service was fast. The Ribs didn't impress my husband too much - a little overlooked. I had the snapper and it was really good ! The key lime pie was so delicious. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Worst. Meal. Ever. We arrived around 9 pm on Friday evening and we were seated right away. The appetizer was extremely overcooked and we requested another. The server asked if we knew how to eat it since she \"had a guy come and try to eat the outer leaves of artichokes.\" Rule 1: don't patronize your customer. Just bring an app that isn't burned. Entrees were one of the fresh fishes of the day and I had the ribeye. The fish was good. The ribeye was the worst cut of steak I have ever had in a restaurant. Ever. In fact, over half of it was pure fat, not marbling. It was cooked at medium rare and that was the only part that was right. It was marinated in soy and pineapple and was so salty in portions of the meat that it was inedible. A good cut with salt and pepper is all they needed or less time marinating, yet I was served an over seasoned fatty disgusting steak that cost almost $40. It came with string fries that I am sure are delicious when they aren't allowed to die in the window. Limp and cold. The server was missing in action and they started cleaning up around us with rolling vacs and iPhones that were being used as flashlights. When you are preparing for closing don't do it around your customers. We still had 40 minutes to closing after being served. $110 meal that was worth only the cost of the wine and the fish. We were sick to spend $$$ on such a horrible experience."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, excellent for a date night.  It is very difficult to find a restaurant in the huntersville area with character and uniqueness.  This fits the bill on both counts.  Good food and excellent staff."}
{"text":"This is an awesome restaurant. Came here on a Friday night with family and my newborn nephew and loved it! The iron skillet cornbread was hands down the best I've had and the same goes for the crab cakes. Pricey, yes...but Worth it. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"My 1 star rating reflects the poor service, as we never even got to our table. Despite having a reservation for 8:45, we were told when we arrived that we would have to wait 15 minutes. 15 minutes later we were told to wait another 20 minutes. Now granted, this was new years eve, and mistakes happen, but the real slap in the face was the rudeness of the two hostesses we spoke with. Far from apologetic, they practically complained that we had showed up on time, and didn't seem to care one way or the other whether we ever got a table. One even remarked audibly to the other, \"I'm out of here at 9:30, anyway.\"  I've worked in food service for many years, and in my opinion the real mark of a good waitstaff is how they perform when things go wrong. If anybody at this restaurant had bothered to apologize, I would not be writing this review. In fact, this is the first review I have ever written on Yelp, ever. But I think people should know that for all it's new-fangled popularity, there's a pretty nasty underside to this restaurant. After all, we were only a part of 3; maybe if we'd had more people, they would have bothered to at least pretend that they cared."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for anniversary dinners and celebratory occasions.  The atmosphere is upscale and the service is excellent.  The meals are prepared with top-quality ingredients by excellent chefs.  I suggest reservations as the place is not real big.  You can't go wrong with 131 Main.  I recommend their wedge salad!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with my experience at 131 Main last night.  I usually don't write reviews unless I feel strongly one way or another.  I made a reservation for our anniversary and the form asked if it was for a special occasion so I checked \"anniversary.\" Not one person acknowledged our anniversary. We didn't expect anything free but usually the wait staff acknowledges a special occasion.  My and my husband's meals were mediocre at best. My trout had very little flavor. My husband ordered a fish special Cajun style, it had little flavor and they forgot the crab topping. They did give him another free meal which was nice.  We felt like we were being rushed throughout the meal even though there was not a line of people waiting. They also sat us by the busiest part of the restaurant, again likely they did not know it was our anniversary.  The salmon appetizer we had was very good.  If I go back, it will only be for a drink or appetizer."}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week. $30 for a glass of wine, appetizer, entree, and dessert!! could not beat this deal! I had the cabernet, which was a a little dry to have with my entree, the double dip (the nachos were so warm and perfectly salted), the cajun shrimp pasta; which was absolutely delicious and the brownie (which my family ate) was wonderful. i def. want to come here again when I visit Charlotte."}
{"text":"So upset! I love this restaurant and love their food! Our family dines frequently but maybe not anymore after a very disturbing take out experience. Ordered the shrimp and grits and my total was $23.44 and I tipped $6. See pict below of the absurdly small portion I found when I got home and opened the to-go container. This dish is the only thing I order from the restaurant and I know the portion is usually a lot bigger... no, not a lot bigger, more like twice the size. There are four shrimp in my to-go box and roughly 1/4 cup of cooked grits. I'm annoyed that there is a disconnect between in-house and to-go portion sizes. For such a fine dining establishment, you would think they would manage this better."}
{"text":"Such a great experience eating on the patio. We went for our anniversary. We brought our own champagne and they did not charge a corkage- super!!  Food was great and service was even better! -K"}
{"text":"LET ME MAKE THIS PERFECTLY CLEAR----THE FOOD WAS VERY GOOD.  For the price they DO NOT give you enough food.  2 people 1 drink each- $ 140 bucks with tip  $ 165... ARE YOU KIDDING ME. A 6 oz filet, a crab cake and some mashed potatoes $ 41.00.  GIVE ME A BREAK.  For the money I pissed away,  I could have went to Capital Grille.  This is more of a referendum of the people that live at Exit 23 to Exit 36/// Every place is fabulous, fabulous, fabulous//// NO IT IS NOT.  They said the same thing about Dresslers--- AVERAGE.  Mortons ,Capital Grille AND Chimas are the only 3 restaurants that have the right to charge what they charge ,  because NEWSFLAH- They are excellent restaurants.  People at the lake- go downtown for a meal once in awhile, seeing some black people will not ruin your night out. The banana cream pie is really good, but so what."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go out to eat with family and friends.  The food and service is always superb! My favorite entree is the fillet mignon and their key lime pie for dessert is truly just as great as it is in Florida at Key West, where that dessert had it's origins.  Love to sit around the fire pit outside with several friends and have a glass of wine or dessert.  A fun place to dine...the staff is top notch!"}
{"text":"It had been many many years since I had gone to 131 Main.  I was pleased that it is still very good.  Parking is still easy and the entrance takes you right past the kitchen.  You get the aromas of the hardwood grill and a nice greeting from the hosts.  Seating was a comfortable booth for 4.  Our server was great and knowledgeable of the menu and also the wines.  I chose a nice chardonnay that I felt certain would pair well with my shrimp and grits!  The shrimp and grits with asparagus and corn was very good.  the shrimp tender...but firm!  Well cooked.  I will have to keep 131 in mind for another visit in the future!!!  I must go back for the skillet cornbread that I was happy to see was still on the menu!!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a great place to go eat since my one year old gave us the night off, and thankfully I found this place. Everything was great even before we arrived they told us that they could put our names in the waiting list over the phone so then we didn't have to wait for a loong time. Well we only wait for 5 minutes once we arrived and they even told us \"thank you for your patience\" I was ready to be very patience for a Friday night in a 5 star restaurant without reservations, come on! I should thank them! The place has a such great atmosphere. The open view of the huge grill is great, and the smell is fantastic. We were so hungry and decided to go with the specials of the night. The corvina with the quinoa salad so yummmmmy and the steak withe the awesome\" mashed potatoes. Our server was so friendly and attentive she told me how they prepared the mashed potatoes which I planned to do from now on. I also ordered the mushroom soup which was so good, so good that my husband who never orders soups, stole it from me. We were ready to lick the plate, it was yummy. Sorry no pictures but we couldn't wait to start eating, I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Never disappointed by this outfit. I'm only sad that they closed the East Blvd location. Had dinner for the first time at the Cornelius location. Food was great. Whip cream on the key lime was off from the norm but the service was also solid. My favorite Charlotte restaurant."}
{"text":"131 Main is always the restaurant that gets people to look up when you mention the name. Great calm environment with amazing food! At times the service can become a bit slow but normally it is fine. I would recommend the double dip as an appetizer. Another pleasing fact about this restaurant is that it's completely fresh. No freezers!"}
{"text":"What happened to your awesome roast beef sandwich? Last three times there- including today- we were all so dissatisfied with what used to be a great sandwich. Much less beef- & fries over salted. Staff was pleasant- but at $18 per sandwich- where's the beef???"}
{"text":"I took a friend there for her birthday.  I picked this place because it had four and half stars on Yelp.  I'm not sure why why it's rated so high as our experience was awful.    We ordered the two dip appetizer, which was salsa and guacamole, and it was terrible.  We then ordered the Ahi Tuna salad for her, and the Cobb salad for myself.  I ordered the Cobb without dressing, and they brought me it with dressing (simple mistake).  It took them every bit of 30 minutes to remake the salad and bring it to me (there wasn't very many people in the restaurant).  The salad tasted awful.  We ordered also ordered two \"Dirty Titos\", and it was 99% olive juice.  When the bill came out, nothing was discounted or comped, which is unheard of in an \"upscale restaurant\".  Myself and my date were very disappointed in the service, and product that was put out here.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"After putting behind my hesitation I had the shrimp and grits. I've only known shrimp and grits from New Orleans where you can taste the freshness. But the white Cheddar grits more than made up for it. The pork in the dish was a little too much. However, I rank this among some of the best shrimp and grits I've ever had. This is probably the best restaurant in Cornelius/Mooresville/Lake Norman area."}
{"text":"Went there for Mother's Day Brunch and everything was very good. The curry corn was not great, flavors kinda clashed in my opinion.   Strawberry shortcake was my favorite of the day, if not my favorite strawberry shortcake that I've ever had.   Jalapeno cornbread, which is my normal front runner was over cooked, and almost burned. But this was a one off, that thing is normally off the charts.   Crab cakes, my go to entree, was superb per the usual. Wish I could give it 4.9 stars, but it won't let me."}
{"text":"Food is okay.  Definately not worth the money.  We've tried the rainbow trout, prime rib, and lamb shank.  Lamb shank is good, but the smashed red potatoes were better.  It's never quite okay when the side is the star of the dish.  Rainbow trout is a generous portion, but expeceted for the price.  Kale salad was amazing one visit, the next visit it was overly garlic and salty.  Prime rib is not good, ordered medium rare, got about medium to medium well.  Not very flavorful."}
{"text":"This is my husband and I's favorite place.  Hands down the BEST restaurant we've found in/around Charlotte. The cocktails are amazing as well as everything we've tried on the menu. We always go for the double dip to start, the steak, ribs and shrimp and grits can't be beat either. We have been here probably about 10 times and have always left totally satisfied"}
{"text":"I love the food here! Whenever I visit the lake norman area I always try to make it over to 131 Main. The wait staff is always very attentive and knowledgable about the menu. I highly recommend going with whatever the features are for the night though! They're always more excellent than what's on the regular menu. My favorite items on the menu are the mushroom and artichoke soup and the banana cream pie! Both are simply to die for."}
{"text":"Salty food and frigid temps make for an uncomfortable dining experience. My family and I ate here last weekend twice and both times had the identical experience of the food being over-salted. The first visit the manager was quick to come to our table, comped us our burgers and handled the interaction very pleasantly, saying that there was a new person working the grill that night. So we came back on Sunday to give it another try, despite being under-whelmed by the experience. Ugh. This time the temperature of the restaurant was so cold we had to take our daughter outside because she was complaining of freezing and I was just miserable. Again the food was so salty it was inedible and this time we were stuck with an expensive check. To be fair, we did not mention anything to the waitress about our food except to say no, we did not want our completely full plates of chicken and fish boxed up. A more experienced waitress might have come by during the meal or asked why we hadn't eaten, but no matter, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Wow. I've been to 131 Main countless times and I guess I've just never gotten around to reviewing it. It's one of my favorite restaurants in the Lake Norman area and we're always coming back for more.   The restaurant is not very big and it's usually pretty busy for dinner, so you'd be best off making reservations, especially on the weekends.  I don't think we've had bad service here ever. It's always pretty good and the servers and bussers seem to work together well.   My favorite is the ribs. They are legitimately fall off the bone and they're so tasty. I usually end up switching my sides from what they automatically come with, and they're super accommodating about that. Their loaded mashed potatoes are awesome and they have a good wedge salad.   For appetizers, their cast iron cornbread and double dip (pimento cheese, guacamole and salsa) are great as well.   They don't use freezers here which is why their menu is small, but everything is always fresh and tasty and it's one of the best restaurants in Lake Norman."}
{"text":"Our group of four visited for dinner. Two had roast beef sandwiches, one had the double cut pork chop, and I had the marinated ribeye. All were very good. The crown was the cornbread! Crispy crust, tender center. Honey on top brought out the sweetness. The only downside was the booth seating was uncomfortable."}
{"text":"131 Main is our favorite restaurant in the Charlotte area.  It's the first place we went to when we moved here a few years ago and it's been our favorite ever since.  The ribs are the best we have ever had.  Love the double dip.  Salads are great too."}
{"text":"It was disappointing that we were not able to get in during  our wedding anniversary.  We called in early for a reservation but was told to come in early instead.  We showed up at 6PM and requested a table for party of 8 but was flat out told they can't accommodate us.  Whatever!  I will make a note not to bother coming in on our next celebration. We had a blast at Port City Club!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Best steak I've ever eaten! Well worth the drive from Statesville. My husband and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Service needs a little help in the dining area, but the service in the bar area is awesome. My drink was never half full, but while I was eating in the dining area I waited for 5-10 mins for a refill. When I go I usually get the ribs with a side of fries and the kale salad. When you think kale, u don't think of eating it raw. But let me tell you how delicious this raw kale salad is! I even make it at home now!"}
{"text":"Good prime rib and good service. Pretty straight forward and nothing real fancy about. It's a good local spot for dinner and drinks. Wife isn't always thrilled with the food but it's a good spot for prime rib and that's hard to come by."}
{"text":"Excellent food,  decent draft selection,  amazing service. Only Complaint,  as a colorblind individual,  the dark setting made reading menus,  navigating the restaurant,  and all-together-noticing my surroundings quite difficult."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of 131 Main for years. I love the freshness of all of their items. I have yet to have a bad meal from here and will continue to go back.   Here are a few of my favorite items on the menu: *Thai Steak Salad -- it is by far one of the best salads I have ever had. As well as their Ahi Tuna Salad. Both have layers of flavors and our worth the price.   *Crab Cake -- I promise you won't be disappointed.   *Key Lime Pie -- I am a lover of key lime pie and they have an excellent pie!   If you ask they will let you create a veggie farmers plate from the offered sides. That was the first time I ever had their kale salad, and it taught me a new year to prepare kale."}
{"text":"The food is very good. We went on a Tuesday night - it was crowded so I was glad we had made reservations. I got the scallops - they were delicious and my aunt got the crab cakes - also delicious. They even went out of their way to customize the crab cakes for her to be gluten free. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Kelsey and smiley were the greatest wait staff.  Courtney was great manager. Wood fired steak, get it blackened too. The fresh skinny fries were delicious. Desserts on the way."}
{"text":"fantastic pricing for fresh ingredients and a great atmosphere. a very good wine selection. no one around can beat the roast beef sandwich from 131 main. they alway have great specials as well. dont forget about desert for you sweet tooths. they are probably one of the only places around that thinks about desert as much as their entrees."}
{"text":"We had reservations and got in fairly quickly (that is not usual on a weekend).  We sat for about 5 minutes before our server greeted us and took our drink order.  He came right back and took our meal order and until he dropped the check that was the last we saw of him (we had wanted to split the check up and he didn't even give us the option or stop long enough for us to ask).  I hated my wine and our food was dropped off so fast I could not ask for anything additional.  The food was not hot and not as good as it has been in past.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a group of friends and this place did not disappoint! The staff was very friendly, they always had a smile on their face. We sat outside and although the tables couldn't be pushed together to accommodate the group we still enjoyed! We all started with the double dip (delicious!) and the cornbread. I ordered the blueberry mule, which I've never seen before, and loved it!!!   Dinner: our table each ordered and then we sampled each other's, thankfully! I ordered filet, asparagus and the corn. All amazing! The filet was cooked perfectly and was a good size. The corn was the most unique thing on their menu that o tried, it's seasoned with a sweet curry and omg it's amazing! We also had the ribs, which literally fell off the bone! You could push the side of the rack down and the bone would pop out, you didn't even have to touch with a knife if you didn't want to! The French fries are shoestring which is my favorite! We did order the special which was sockeye salmon, this was very overlooked unfortunately, we did finish it but would not recommend or reorder again.   Overall the experience was great, the staff was amazing and the food was unique and a must try!"}
{"text":"Normally one of my favorite spots, but was seriously disappointed this last visit. We were seated in a back corner table and were surrounded by flies the entire time. To make it even worse a dying fly was buzzing the entire time. My husband swatted the already dead flies off the window seal, but that didn't stop the others from landing on our food the entire the time. To spend this much for dinner & drinks you'd expect not to be sharing the meal with flies, both dead & dying mid meal... severally disappointing."}
{"text":"Nice, upscale restaurant in the Lake Norman area. We like to come here for special occasions or when we have guests in town. They have a new(er) outdoor fireplace with some chairs but not sure you can dine outside. It tends to be dark inside (dimly lit lights). Service is spectacular and the servers tend to work together and help each other out, which I always appreciate. Most recently, we started with the cast iron cornbread for an appetizer. It comes with a honey glaze which suits it well. My MIL got the ribs with fries and kept talking about how good they were, fall off the bone ribs. I had a salad with salmon, which was very delicious. I made a few changes to the salad and they got every detail right. It's a little pricier to eat here but the service is great and the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the 131 main down in ballantyne and we usually come with a whole group of around 12 people so, I was excited to hear there was one in Cornelius. Sadly, I cant express how much I was disappointed with their filet mignon. We first received the steak practically raw and cold in the middle so we sent it back. They had thrown it back on the grill so when they brought it back out, I had to saw through it and when I took a bite, it tasted as if they had cleaned the entire grill with it. It was the toughest and worst tasting filet mignon I have ever had in my entire life. I was especially disappointed in how management handled the situation compared to the ballantyne branch."}
{"text":"Small menu but great service and food. Super overpriced for what is offered, though. The cornbread and double dip are great apps, and their prime rib/roast beef sandwich is awesome (but not worth the price they're charging nowadays...seems to go up by at least $1+ each year). Ribs are also delightful. Overall, there are similar options in the area offering the same quality of food and experience for a lower price point."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience.  I took my wife here for our anniversary and it was great.  Great outdoor fire pit started off our evening great and set the mood.  Some drinks and then we were sat.  Our waitress was great and made a great suggestion with our appetizer, which we loved.  My wife had a pasta dish which she loved and I had a nicely cooked steak with some veggies.  Great food, great atmosphere and very nice staff.  Was a great experience, especially nice for our 23 wedding anniversay!  Thank you 131 Main."}
{"text":"This is the place to go.  Dinner for two including a bottle of wine...just $65.  You will be glad you tried this place.  The food was special just like the service."}
{"text":"Best burgers ever! The ambiance is nice but still casual, and the servers are always nice and helpful. I would recommend the double dip as an appetizer, and definitely save room for their awesome desserts--I'm very partial to the key lime pie. The kale salad makes a great side. I've never had a bad experience here, and it's especially fun for birthday dinners. I would recommend making reservations on the weekend."}
{"text":"OMG I love this place. They have the best Double Dip ever!!! We came to visit from CA and had the best experience here today. Our waitress Charlotte was just amazing. Very sweet and courteous!!! Hands down to her!!"}
{"text":"Wow! We have eaten at this restaurant over a dozen times, and only once were we even mildly disappointed with one aspect of the meal. Every other time our meals have been outstanding!  We have tried a few of the appetizers, but think that the double dip is just delicious! The homemade pimento cheese and guacamole together along with those salty chips is just as satisfying as it gets. I almost always get the ribs and have never, never, never been disappointed with them! I have also gotten the steak that was very good as well. My wife likes the ribs, but she enjoys some of the side items they have so much that she usually orders a salad and sides and has a rib or two from my plate. We have brought family members with us and told them about the excellent service and meals and everyone has always agreed with us. Do yourselves a favor and finish off the meal with the brownie sundae... Probably one of the best desserts I have ever had anywhere in my life. And always consistent!  We tried their location in downtown Charlotte one time years ago, and it was an absolute disaster... Since then that location closed. Have not tried location in Asheville yet, but we will because we like the Biltmore town Park area.    The service is always amazing, the food is absolute perfection and their portions are very filling! This place should be the gold standard for all restaurants.  To those about to dine, I salute you! Enjoy yourselves!"}
{"text":"I am here on Xmas holiday only.  My reviews are based off my experience being born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area so...   take this for how it relates to you.  I freely admit that I'm a snooty bitch.  So... don't hate...     131 Main vaguely reminds me of a small scale chain in my local area that includes Los Altos Grill (bay area), Rutherford Grill (napa), Houston's (san francisco), and a few more...      Check it out yourself, and tell me it's not practically the same... ( http://hillstone.com/ )...  As you can see, 131 has a very similar menu to the Hillstone Group, from the deviled eggs, to the grilled artichoke, right down to the cast iron skillet corn bread....    Roast chicken, steaks. fish, burgers, salads, and sandwiches are the big feature items.      Only 131 is not quite hitting the mark, IMO.   If you've ever been to one of the aforementioned Hillstone restaurants... and then you try 131...  you will feel that 131 is a somewhat poor imitation of the original.   The quality is just not as high, it's not as well executed...   and the service is far too aloof.    Also, there is no free corkage at 131... which is what the Hillstone folks are famous for.. and for the price, 131 should offer no corkage too.     Or at least a better wine list.  131 is dimly lit and boothy.  Yes.   But is it \"upscale\"?  Absolutely not..   Not by my standards.    Is it a bit spendy?  Somewhat...   but as far as quality and service goes, this restaurant is more along the lines of mid-scale.    That being said.. would I go back?  Sure.. why not...    It's a fine place to eat.  WAY better than most.   Just don't expect uber-high-end...   You're perfectly fine in jeans and a tshirt, with family.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is soooo close to five stars. So close! And that last star is totally within reach. So let's get crackin', 131 Main. (Can I call you \"131?\" No? Too soon for us to be on a first name basis? Okay, \"131 Main\" it is. But next month I'll have won you over, and I'll be calling you fun nicknames like \"OneTreyOne\" and \"Mainie,\" and you'll be EATING IT UP.)  So. Back to reality.  They have reservations, which is great. But even with a reservation I had a 20 minute wait to be seated, and the hosts didn't seem to know who was next in line for a table even though (1) everyone waiting had reservations, and (2) everyone waiting also had buzzers. This seems like a basic organizational/training issue. Fixable. On the plus side, at least the dining room was packed -- it's not like they don't understand crowd control, they were just exceptionally busy for a random weekday.  They have a prixe fixe menu. I LOVE me some fixed price, multi-course, alcohol-included meals. My husband and I were surprised at how many options were available to us in the prixe fixe menu and pleased when they came out. The portions were H-U-G-E. I mean, I had enough for a full meal and leftovers for lunch for me and my husband the following day. Color me happy.  Negatives about the meal: my husband's chicken dish came out  to the table lukewarm. Room temperature. Almost cool. So ... that needs to be fixed. And my salmon dish was super salty. Like really really salty. And my green beans were ever so slightly undercooked. I also couldn't figure out the server situation. I understand that it's a team setup, but I couldn't figure out who could take our order, who could bring us more drinks, etc. I think a better explanation on the front end would've helped me feel less lost.   Also, a suggestion: throw some local wines and more local beers onto that drink list. I'd rather spend a little extra dough helping out the Old North State than sending my moolah to Italy in exchange for their wine.  In sum: this was a very good dining experience, but it had some (fixable) issues that would make it a true five-star restaurant."}
{"text":"Love, love, love 131 Main! Service is always great....attentive, polite, friendly staff. Restaurant is consistently clean. Food is amazing. I'm a huge fan of the kale salad, it's the best I've had. My only disappointment is that often, some favorites are removed from the menu. The fish tacos were fantastic but no longer available.  Overall great dining option. I take all my out of town guests here and it never fails me."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant by far!!! My husband and I come here for date night all the time! Very similar to Houston's in Atlanta. Everything we have had has been amazing from the salads, to burger, to shrimp and grits. Brunch is a must as well!"}
{"text":"The original 131 Main... I'm so happy to see this restaurant grow to 4 NC locations! This location is the one I frequent the most. The staff there is great, food is terrific & drinks are refreshing! I only wish there was more seating. The Lake Norman crowd loves 131 Main too, so they stay busy a lot. :) Go with the Thai steak salad, prime rib or crab cakes for an entree...double dip, scallops or cornbread as your appetizer. DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Have enjoyed better food on airlines. Just plain cheap and over priced. Waited for a table for 20 minutes even though the restaurant was half empty. The ambiance was of a fine dinning establishment with gas lamps and candles , minus an equal menu . Avoid."}
{"text":"We had a rude server, Kayla something,  food was good. I guess I've seen much better service and much more variety in food. If u have money to blow on small portions then I guess it's nice. Over priced drinks a d salads. Otherwise very dim... I burned myself on their cornbread appetizer. Lol clumsy me"}
{"text":"Best restaurant (no matter which location) by far in Charlotte area.  Food is always delicious. Corn bread is to die for...and the service - top notch!  The staff shares servicing the tables which means we never have to find our wait person before we can get what we need.  We are never disappointed- Always great service and food!"}
{"text":"We live around the corner from 131 main and thought we would try it instead of the same old places. The employees are very nice and take care of you rather quickly which is great yet they are very cold, almost like robots. Our food was very good but not for the price. We usually spend 80+ on dinners because we enjoy quality food for the 2 of us but the food was nothing to crave or want to revisit. I feel I could've had the same experience at a Longhorn (we don't do chains so this explains my frustration) but would've had a more pleasant experience with the staff, well personable. Enjoyed food but won't be back. I wouldn't call this find dining, just food over priced."}
{"text":"Great food and half price wine bottles on tuesdays!  Cast iron skillet corn bread with a side of honey as an app..wow!  So good.  Everything we had was delicious...fresh trout with kale salad, shrimp and grits, roasted chicken, and salmon on a cedar plank with cold rice salad. YUM YUM YUM!  Love the atmosphere and service was excellent.  Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've heard of this place and finally got the chance to come try it out. I got the crab cakes and they were the best crab cakes I've ever had! It came with jumbo asparagus and I don't know where those asparagus' came from but they were freaking humongous, which is cool. Portions were huge, which is awesome, especially for the price you're paying. The setting is super moody and perfect for dates. To be honest though, it was so dimly lit, I couldn't tell what some of the colors of my food were. But at least it was good!"}
{"text":"Got the ribeye and it was cooked to perfection along with a good recommendation from the server of a red wine that I had to go with it. Service was great and the place was top notch! I only wish I could go there again, but I'm already back home."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really nice. I would have given it 5 stars if there was more to choose from on the menu, but other than that, it's a great restaurant with great service. Fairly pricey, but overall a great experience. I visited this location for my mother's birthday. I called and made a reservation earlier in the week and had no issues once we arrived. The servers are very knowledgeable which made my daughter and I extremely excited because of everything they were reciting from specials, to knowledge about wines.  I was able to taste two different wines to determine which I wanted to order.   I ordered the ribs with fries and honey mustard which were all great. The fries are similar to shoestring fries, very slim/thin. Most places have terrible honey mustard, theirs was perfect to my liking. The ribs were not hot, as if they had just been placed on the plate. More so as if they had been sitting for a little while. They were still good though and fell off the bone, which are my kind of ribs!  The atmosphere of the restaurant is nice as well. I like brighter restaurants better, and this one was pretty dim. I would definitely return though."}
{"text":"We just left from my husband's birthday dinner and loved it. We started with the smoked salmon appetizer which was wonderful! Dennis had the gazpacho and he loved it. I had the crab cakes in the mustard sauce, which sounds odd but was amazing. Dennis had the lamb which he loved. We finished with the brownie a la mode, which has Kahlua, caramel and chocolate sauces. Yum! Service was perfect. Our server April was attentive, and the servers all helped each other out with delivering orders and picking up plates. All in all, a fantastic place."}
{"text":"Pricey but so delicious. My family ordered takeout (Cobb salads) and they were so fantastic. Pretty expensive at $16 a salad (1-star off for that), so over $50 when totaled for 3 salads but really, really good.   I have not eaten inside the restaurant but ran in to pick-up the order, it's very beautiful and seems like a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"After my last visit I had no immediate plans on trying 131 Main again. The owner reached out to me and asked if I would provide my information so that the general manager could contact me. I agreed and shortly thereafter Jeff contacted me to find out what had happened and wanted to know what they could do better so that other customers don't go through the same situation. First off I've never had an owner contact me, most either don't monitor their reviews or just don't care enough to reach out. He was very nice, helpful and genuinely wanted to rectify the situation and use this as a way to educate his staff on what they did wrong. So huge kudos to the owner and Jeff for so diligently working with me on the situation.  Now for tonight's experience... Night and day from the first time I visited on my birthday back in July. We didn't have a reservation which I highly recommend because this place gets hopping later in the evening. We showed up early around 5:30pm so we were seated right away. The ambience in this restaurant is amazing! Such a romantic setting with the dim lights and beautiful decor. We were greeted right away by a gentleman that took our drink orders and ran down the specials for the night. Shortly thereafter our primary waiter arrived and his name was Christian (I think and hope). His last name was Allred because I asked him if that was his first name after getting the bill at the end of the night. But anyways he was very friendly, took our appetizer order and food order. He always had a great smile and quick comeback to my lame jokes. Between him and even Jeff the GM I always had a drink in front of me. We decided to try the double dip for our appetizer. This was awesome and we highly recommend it! Made fresh at the beginning at every shift I was told and the taste we experienced agreed. Next we split a main wedge salad with the creamy garlic dressing. This was heavenly, so much flavor going on in a salad!! For our main course I selected the 14oz ribeye and my wife ordered one of the specials of the night called filet mignon medallions with roasted mashed red potatoes. My steak came with fries but I wanted a potato instead but was told that they didn't have loaded potatoes but they could make me some loaded mashed potatoes. Omg they did such a good job on them and the ribeye was cooked exactly how I ordered it... medium. Everything was so good we ate every bite!! At the end even though we didn't need it we ordered dessert. We ordered a piece of key lime pie and peanut butter chocolate pie. Both were amazing and huge slices. We ended up taking some home. Perfect end to a phenomenal experience. Thank you Jeff for making sure we are taken care of which we were. Thank you for periodically checking in on us and making us feel welcomed and special. Thanks to Christian for taking care of us, you are the man! We will definitely be back. Check out my pictures!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here for restarunt week again this year. Requested prime rib be on the menu and included on the special menu and it was. I'm sure my request didn't get it done but many requests as it is wonderful. I had the ribs, outstanding, and the wife had the prime rib. We were with 5 other people who ordered other items and not complaint one on the food. The service was good but they may have been a little short handed due to slow refills but if that is all you have to complain about your having a good day. I plan on visiting again soon."}
{"text":"Large restaurant with space for groups at spacious booths or small tables. An ample menu with options across seafood and land food as well as a few specials for starters and mains. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the fish - both the special seared tuna appetizer and mahi-mahi were very good. Portions are healthy and the plates are huge."}
{"text":"This is our special occasion place. We always do the Double Dip App. My fiancé loves the Prime Rib. The apricot glazed chicken is a large portion. The ribs are amazing. The salads are fresh and so flavorful. I've never eaten an entree I didn't love. Our reservations are usually respected with no additional wait time. The prices are higher than chain restaurants, but the quality of food, service, and atmosphere reflect the value."}
{"text":"Wife and I enjoyed our meals: hamburger prepared exactly as requested; corned beef sandwich delightful on toasted rye with cabbage slaw and special dressing; pencil fries as good as always. Ordered banana cream pie to take home (can't pass that up)."}
{"text":"We love going to 131 Main, service is impeccable every time and the food is outstanding.  Always, always, always go for the smoked salmon appetizer and ask for extra sauce.  Dining room can be a little dark but the food compensates for that anytime. We have had great experiences at lunch and dinner sitting inside and outside.  Food: 5 Sporks Service: 5 Sporks Atmosphere: 4 Sporks Sweet Tea: 3 Sporks Value: 3 Sporks Local Beer: 1 Sporks"}
{"text":"Our first time to 131 main!  We were very excited as we have heard good things about it since moving from of state in feb. Except from our real estate agent who got food poisoning here...yikes!    We figured with all the hype of restaurant week lets make a reservation and do it.  Our reservation was for 6pm, we arrived promptly and waited behind 2 parties that did not have a reservation and were seated at 6:20, annoying.   Our waitress was fine if also not also a bit annoying with how over the top she was in her description if the food ....it went on and on....  So we stuck to the restaurant week menu and ordered the queso app (really not good, it's a cold dip and the other half is guacamole), and the corn bread which was soooo yummy. I have since tried to replicate their recipe with no success. I might on occasion have to get some to go.   For our entree both ordered the queen cut prime rib with mashed. It was a petite cut of meat that's for sure but the flavor was good and it was medium as we ordered. The mashed were good but in general our entree was underwhelming. Good but not note worthy. We also both ordered the brownie sundae for dessert which again was fine but not better per se than others I've had.   So the food although good was nothing special (except the corn bread which is) but the big problem here is that we received our apps 5 min after ordering then here comes our entree maybe 4 min after that and our waitress was asking us about dessert into our second bite of our steak!  No joke, we left with 6 small take out containers and 50 min after we arrived. The waitress apologized saying that things just are flying out of the kitchen because of rest week paying no regard to timing. Really?  Rest week is to get people to try your restaurant and this is your game plan to impress them?  We were both so annoyed that we just went with it and left with more than half of our food in tow. Our bill was over $80 with 2 diet cokes and truly  our meal was good but nothing great. I am so disappointed with this experience I will not be back.   So I took away one star for making me wait to be seated behind 2 parties without a reservation. I took another away for rushing me.  I took another away for very average food and I should take another away for the annoying waitress but I will be generous and  leave this review with 2 stars and won't be back."}
{"text":"was here last year and forgot to review. This is a favorite. Staff is well trained and friendly. The food was well prepared and delish!  The only issue is the pricing. It's a bit too high. We wait for restaurant week to enjoy."}
{"text":"131 Main is my favorite restaurant in the Lake Norman area. Highly recommend the Thai steak salad. So delicious! Everything tastes fresh and they make great cocktails too. Favorite appetizer is the grilled artichokes for sure."}
{"text":"Quality restaurant here.  Went for the first time with my wife for our anniversary last night. Nice intimate ambiance, good for date night. Probably not the best place to take young children.  Our server, Elizabeth, was attentive, courteous, and friendly. We ordered the cast iron cornbread for an appetizer and it was a much larger portion than we thought but it was delicious. My wife ordered the Danish baby back ribs and I had the classic cheeseburger. The ribs were fall off the bone tender and the sauce was tasty. My burger was a perfect medium-rare as ordered and the meat was seasoned well.  I also liked how the shredded lettuce was dressed and not just an afterthought. Our entrees also came out VERY quickly despite it being a packed house. Our server asked us if the food was delicious so they are very confident in their cooking and they should be.   Highly recommended and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I seriously miss this restaurant since we moved out of Charlotte.  It was my favorite. Always good. Farm to table food. Excellent braised red cabbage. Excellent entrees all around. Desserts are just so-so. Make reservations, especially on the weekends!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times before with work colleagues and always have had a good meal, but going in solo and eating at the bar was a much different experience. The bartender was nice enough, but I was off put by a $32 steak (filet) that only comes with Mashed potatoes, coming out with lukewarm potatoes. This was magnified by the fact that the gentleman next to me had just informed the bartender that his potatoes were not hot, and he was about finished with his meal when I ordered mine.  I was not asked how the meal was until I had about 6 bites left. In the interest of sparing someone else from the lukewarm potatoes, I told the bartender, and she even remarked that the other man had said the same thing about the potatoes, then walked away. When I was finished with my steak, a huge pile of potatoes showed up as if I was going to just eat some more potatoes on their own.    The girl that brought out the potatoes announced \"someone ordered extra hot potatoes\", as if to say that the first ones were hot, but these were extra hot. I informed her that I had no interest in the potatoes, and she should take them back, but they were left anyways.  No discounts or apologies, which was super frustrating. The steak was average for a filet and although ordered medium, it has a cooler red center closer to medium rare.  All in all very disappointing."}
{"text":"ALWAYS impressed. The food, service and atmosphere is amazing. I have never ordered a bad thing. My favorites are Artichokes, Cornbread, Thai steak salad and veggie burger....great fries....Also fresh squeezed OJ goes great with some Tito's vodka. This is a place I take all my out of towners and my mom's favorite when she comes to town."}
{"text":"While in the Charlotte area, the Hubby suggested we stop here and grab dinner. For an appetizer we ordered the Double Dip and a side of Cast Iron Corn Bread. The double dip was not bad, but I think it would have been better if it was served warm. The cast iron corn bread was ok as well, but it tasted better with the honey they give you to dip it in. My hubby ordered the house lemonade, which I thought was really tart for my taste. For dinner I ordered the crab cakes with a side salad (which is a $2 dollar up charge if you don't get a regular side). My crab cakes did not taste that great. Finally for dessert we ordered the strawberry shortcake to go. When we got to my sister in laws house to eat the short cake (which was only 10 minutes away) the biscuit for the short cake was really HARD, and we could not finish our dessert. In all, I was not highly impressed with this place."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were enough to make me want to come back for more! Yum!"}
{"text":"This our go-to restaurant in North Charlotte.  We've never had a bad experience.  The entrees rival the hot - to it restaurants and at a better price. There are too many favorites, but if I had to pick... App: Double Dip. The artichoke dip is really good, too. Entree: love the ribs. With fries (amazing). Just had the Kale salad for the first time and that was really good (had to have healthy option). Cedar plank salmon was awesome. Dessert: must get a banana creme pie. You cannot leave without ordering. If you are too stuffed, take it to go."}
{"text":"I just moved into the area a few months ago. This was my first visit to 131 Main. Loved the food! Our service was great! Ask for Lindsey. She was knowledgable, fast, and sweet. I ordered the lamb chops and my husband ordered that night's special of prime rib. Both were great! I do have to say that if I was going for a large portion of meat the lamb chops are not the thing to order. It was perfect for me though. The only reason that I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because the restaurant is a bit noisy. Not sure that could change since the kitchen is open. Other than the noise, it was great."}
{"text":"Always a great choice for quality and tasty traditional surf and turf!  This was my first visit to this location as I live much closer to the one in Dilworth. And overall, we had a really good meal!  Started out with the Double Dip appetizer, which are chips and salsa, with fresh guacamole and piemento cheese. Nicely done.  Michelle had the Crab Cakes with jumbo lump crabs and a delicious mustard Remoulade sauce! I got their ribeye, but chose the one marinaded in a sweet soy. Grilling it carmelizes the sweet soy for a delicious sweet char-grill flavor, but not too sweet! Steak was perfectly cooked!  While I RARELY drink Merlot (think Miles in Sideways....), I couldn't resist getting a Merlot from Washington State where I lived for 2 years in the early 2000s. Very nice and smooth.  Service was good and efficient, food really good, and dining with one awesome lady...What more can you ask?"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Simply put, this is a quality restaurant with real quality food.  Love the ambiance and the location is perfect.  I can eat anything there as it's all good all the time."}
{"text":"Many visits to 131 Main in Charlotte, esp Blakney, but first time here in Cornelius.  Same theme, but slightly different...and in a good way.  Menu was abbreviated.  Maybe because it was Sunday?  So not the many choices we are used to.  For instance, meat loaf, one of our favorites was missing, but grilled artichokes were still there.  The artichokes make for a great sharing appetizer of could be a light lunch.    Service is simply excellent.  Caroline kept up the pace and was immediately responsive to us.    I had a Manhattan cocktail which was excellent.  Then the baby back ribs, which was a full rack, cooked so well that the meat did fall off of the bones.  And because of the thorough cooking, most of the fat had melted off.  The ribs were not slathered or drowned with sauce, which you see in many BBQ places.  It was just the right amount.  I asked Caroline if I wanted more sauce could I get it?  And she said, \"Sure...as much as you want.\"  Nice to know that the people who order BBQ for the sauce can get their fix.  One difference we notes was the bus staff.  In Blakney the bus staff snatches plates as soon as they are empty.  Very efficient, but annoying, especially if you are a group.  The bussers hover around the tables and a so quick that soon all but two of a group of six are still finishing their meals.  Not so in Cornelius.  Their bussers wait until each course is complete before swarming in.  When in Blakney, we ask the bus staff to hold off until each course is completed and that helps.  Atmosphere is quiet and dark.  Not quite a kid place, but our grandchildren love to come to 131.  And they are well behaved.  If you have wandering children who want to get out of their seats, they might get truly in the way of the busy wait staff.  Wife had the Thai steak salad which looked like a small mountain set in front of her.  The ginger flavored dressing was very tasty and my wife loved it.  And looking at the portion of meat served within the salad was generous for sure.  Their wines are available by the glass and are listed/grouped on the menu by price.  Excellent idea.  If you want a bottle, there is a more complete wine menu.  Nice place, plenty of parking and the open kitchen is always a great atmosphere enhancer.  They do a good job and seeing so much consistency among the 131 Main locations lets one know that management is on top of things."}
{"text":"The freshest food and the best wait staff around, you can't find a better piece of Prime Rib in Charlotte for the price. Try their cornbread and their fresh cut French fries or the main salad!!"}
{"text":"Update:  It seems my favorite restaurant is out-pricing itself.  The food is still really good but they are continually raising their prices as if they are a Michelin starred restaurant.   Expect to pay $28 for a 6-oz grilled fish and side of quinoa or $30 for an 8-oz filet mignon and a side of mashed potatoes.    While I appreciate the simplicity and purity of the food they serve, I feel there are other restaurants that are emerging that offer more creative options for the same or less.  I will not be returning unless they reprice."}
{"text":"We have now dined here for lunch and dinner and have had great experiences. Dinner is very busy, especially on weekends. I would recommend making reservations if you can. We came without one and were lucky enough to be seated at the last table left outside. Lunch was not very busy, so we were seated quickly by the friendly hostess. Just the smell of the woodfire grill will make you happy walking in.  Both times I ordered the crabcakes, once in entrée form and once a crabcake salad. The crab cakes are amazing! Full of crabmeat and slightly crispy crust. The asparagus that comes with the entrée is decent. I preferred the salad, very refreshing. Love the touch of the cornbread croutons.   My husband's burger was so tasty, perfectly cooked with a great grill flavor. The fries were crispy and very well seasoned... addictive.   131 Main is a little bit pricey, but worth it every once in a while. I'm sure we will be back many times."}
{"text":"I usually don't eat veggie bean burgers. But my friend said they were really good so I tried it with the quinoa salad. It was amazing. Also shared a good Cobb salad with the corn bread croutons...excellent!"}
{"text":"This is a good solid restaurant. The service is very good. The food is well prepared and even comes to the table hot.  I had a rib eye-hand cut fries that were very good. Just remember although good this is not a steak house.  I would consider this one of the better restaurants in the Lake Norman area.  You will get a good meal."}
{"text":"Just had my first experience at 131 Main. LOVED IT. I had the Ahi tuna salad which was a delicious blend of avocado, greens and a smoky seared tuna. Expensive at 20+ bucks but worth it as a splurge. I have had similar salads in other Charlotte restaurants and this one is far superior. Our server (Charlotte) could not have been nicer. All around good experience."}
{"text":"I have eaten here numerous times and the food is always good and the staff provides exemplary service.  Even the 'simple' items are done well, such as the deviled eggs, the cornbread, the mashed potatoes and the side salads.  All makes for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in the area.  The food has always been good as well as the service.  The prices are reasonable.  The absolute best is their dessert, banana cream pie.  It is to die for!"}
{"text":"131 Main aims for the more upscale dining experience, a la Mickey and Mooch's, and for the most part hits the mark.   It's been a while since I've been there, so I sent a spy in to see what has changed and what hasn't. I'm happy to report that things are apparently still very much normal: excellent service and excellent food in a nice setting.  131 Main has three locations in the Charlotte area: south of uptown on Rea Rd., the Dilworth area and Lake Norman, which was opened in 2004.  The brick that covers the interior walls is from a closed cola plant in SC, offering an old-school and unique feel to the dining area, which seats 175 people.  Appetizers will run you anywhere from $7 to $12, and entrees from $15 to $30-ish.   The filet is an excellent choice, as are the burgers. I've also been told the pork chops are tasty.  Overall, a nice place with a great vibe, perfect for a first date...or a 30th date."}
{"text":"What an adorable spot outside of Charlotte!   Great atmosphere (good for date night), friendly service, nice wine list and excellent food.   All I have to say is - Cast Iron Cornbread with Honey. It is one of the best things I've ever eaten. It's like eating dessert before dinner. There is a bit of jalapeno, just to give some flavor, no heat.   My girlfriend and I shared two salads. The Thai beef salad and the Metropolis. Both were very good.  I wanted to have something heartier and southern, but felt kind of guilty after the cornbread...  Definitely a place to try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Dinner, Lunch and Sunday Brunch are all good.  Been awhile since we have been here so my wife and I decided to visit the Sunday Brunch again.  Church ended at 10:30 and by the time we collected everything and drove over it was 10:50. They don't open for Sunday Brunch till 11:00 so we waited a few minutes and walked in. Almost perfect timing.  We were the first couple in and were immediately seated in a booth down the first aisle. 131 tends to have lower lighting that I like and with all of the dark, wood it can be a bit hard to read the menu. To make matters worst, shortly after placed our order, the closed all of the blinds and the dark got darker.  Both of us started out with coffee which was excellent. Bold and Rich with excellent flavor.  Menu is creative and well executed and both my wife an I opted for one of the Benedict's. She ordered the Steak Benedict while I went for the Crab Cake Benedict. . Both came with White Cheddar Grits and Grilled Asparagus as well.  While we waited, our server made sure that we did not want for anything. Our cups and water glasses were constantly full. When my wife excused herself to go the restroom, she left her napkin on her seat. The served came over and picked it up and refolded it for here. A mark of a good restaurant that pays attention to details and to their customers.  Both dishes came out in a timely fashion.  I'm a fan of presentation and plating which is almost a lost art but not here. Not only were the dishes appealing to the taste but also very visually appealing.  As for the entree itself, both were excellent.  The Crab Benedict maintained the delicate flavor and texture of the crab cake and while I am not a fan or grits which is ironic since I am a Southerner, these grits were delicious and may make me a fan.  Asparagus was excellent. Nice and tender with no hint of toughness.  My wife enjoyed here Steak Benedict as well. She ordered medium and she got a perfect medium with exactly the right amount of pink.  Not dry and very flavorful as well.  Portion sizes were large. I am a gregarious eater and ended up leaving a small amount of grits and not because I did not like them but because I was sated. My wife ended up with a to go box which she had for lunch the next day.  They call it a doggy bag but believe me, the Corgi lost out on this one.  Good place for quite dining in a relaxed atmosphere and what some would consider romantic.  Highly recomment"}
{"text":"Another fabulous evening at 131 Main, Huntersville. Valentine's dinner did not disappoint. Our waiter, Greg was attentive, friendly, & gave very good customer service!  We had the baby back ribs and the roasted chicken and both were delicious. The brussel sprout side dish was on point. No dessert but the Chocolate Noir martini was mmmm good. I highly recommend having a reservation as this spot is very popular.  Congrats to the management, chefs, wait staff, and others."}
{"text":"Make reservations if you go on weekends. I like the lunches. Dinner, be prepared to dress up. Who's who? Business wise . Usually crowd party of 6/8 yuppies. Not a family restaurant ( no kids)"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place. Not too expensive, and gives off that fine dining impression. I ordered a chicken sandwich with fries, and their plain salad with herb vinaigrette dressing. Everything was amazing, right down to the customer service!"}
{"text":"Had lunch. Grilled artichoke appetizer fantastic.  Grilled rainbow trout very very good with tasty kale salad very healthy.  Perfect service.  Food served hot. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Sensational Danish baby back ribs, meatloaf, salmon, shrimp and grits, mixed drinks, wine list, dinner salads... Everything cooked to perfection!  Amazingly good!"}
{"text":"Met here for yet another girl's night. Had reservations, arrived 15 minutes early and was seated right away. The atmosphere is perhaps a bit too dark, my younger friend had to use her phone flashlight to see the menu..and she has good vision! It also is fairly loud. If one was hard of hearing, I doubt they would be able to converse. But on the flip, you can be a little loud yourself and people won't turn and stare at you! As a fan of the hop, their beer selection is very sad if not poor. Wine list looks better, although my friend didn't recognize any of the selections from the  regular menu..and she drinks wine exclusively. We shared the smoked salmon app. Excellent, well smoked piece of fish accompanied by a nicely seasoned spread with toast points. I was all set to simply order a burger, but opted for the prime rib sandwich....with fries, of course. Their fries are top notch!!! My sandwhich was very tasty, came with Au jus, and was served on a very nice toasty bread. It was a bit small, and the amount of meat seemed a bit lacking for $22. The other dish ordered was the Ahi Tuna salad, and it looked fabulous! I was sorry I didn't order it. My friend  regularly orders that item. We were celebrating a belated birthday, so ordered the banana cream something or other on the recommendation of our server. That was quite delicious! The 3 of us did not finish it.  I would say the staff seemed to be a bit off. We noticed several mix-ups in where food was going, but was not annoying. Perhaps they were training.  All in all, 131 is a staple in the neighborhood. If you've never been, you should try it. But there are so many places to eat in the area that I would probably choose first. Be sure to get their fries...they are the bomb."}
{"text":"One of only a few upscale dining  choices in the Huntersville in the lake norman area.  Quality is first class and a great wait staff.    The thai salad is awesome, one of a kind.  The smell walking in to this place sets your palate in gear.    Atmosphere is warm and luxurious.  Fire pit and outdoor dining a plus.   The bar area seems lacking, can't really point it out but it works.   Maybe the size/location of it gets to me.     5 stars for sure but you can come casual!  ....just ate outside at 131 on their patio this gorgeous weekend!    Again, ordered the thai salad...one of kind and off the chart!   Thx 131!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal here and loved the outdoor seating by the fire. Friendly, attentive service and fresh, delicious food! I ordered the ahi salad and thought it was terrific. My husband's shrimp and grits stole the show though and were fantastic -- highly recommended! We also ordered the cornbread to start after reading great Yelp reviews and thought it was quite tasty but not necessarily deserving of all the hype. Loved this restaurant though and will happily return in the future!"}
{"text":"Wish I had a picture of all the food I've obliterated here but don't think you would like to see a slide show of me grubbing! I am in love with this restaurant and it is pretty close to my house so it is a family favorite. To be 100% honesty I have never had a bad experience here. On the rare occasion that something has not been up to par with the norm, the extremely friendly and knowledgeable staff fixed the problem right away. I have never had a restaurant experience that is consistently outstanding like 131 and that is what keeps me coming back. The location is okay but the atmosphere inside the restaurant is very comfortable. Great for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Delicious....just delicious.  I went there for a girls lunch.  We had reservations for 8 and were seated promptly one Saturday afternoon.  Our waiter, well he was interesting.  Attentive, but very sweaty...it was weird. Maybe a table full of boisterous women made him uncomfortable, maybe he was coming down off of drugs...who knows.  It was weird.  He came to take our drink orders and then when he came back to take our meal orders he was glistening...and while standing there talking too us he continued to drip sweat.  DRIP it.  Anywho...  The food.  I had the Thai steak salad with (at my waiter's suggestion - shrimp).  OMG it was good.  Best salad ever.  A girlfriend also had the salad.  Asked for it slightly dressed.  They totally didn't do it - she had to send it back.  Me on the other hand. I don't mind a heavy hand on a dressing so yummy.  For dessert we split the strawberry shortcake.  Again - just fantastic.  I took a star of for the shrimp...it was distinctly 'fishy.'  It wasn't bad, but had that cheap, farm caught shrimp taste.    Trying to figure out when I can make it back and get the Thai Salad again."}
{"text":"2.5 stars  The decor is welcoming, the gas lights cozy, the hardwood tabletops warm, the banquettes are quality built and very comfortable (other establishments should copy these) the service is attentive and leaves nothing to be desired.   The food is simply MEH!  As starved as I was at lunch time I felt let down as soon as I read the menu, nothing there made me think \"I want that!\". Instead the menu was very limited and so totally unoriginal it might as well have been written back in the early 80's.   We settled for the Thai Steak salad ($15) and a half rack of baby backs ($17). The marinated tenderloin tips were tasty, the salad itself was pretty good but not great and the mango was missing in action - it had been replaced by orange slices instead.   The baby back ribs were simply mediocre by any standards, the \"hand cut\" fries were the string type pretty good the killer was that although the food was served fast, too fast in fact both the ribs and the potatoes were room temperature.    The waitress enquired almost immediately if everything was satisfactory, I was just not in the mood to fuss, all I wanted was to eat and go so I told her yes. The best thing about the meal was a side of P&G slaw. That's it.     This is a top rated restaurant! I compared Yelp ratings at this location with the ones in Dilworth and Ballantyne. Cornelius gets twice as many 5 stars reviews, and many fewer negative reviews. Seeing the quality of the cuisine here all I can deduce is that once you leave the city expectations run much lower."}
{"text":"Today I ordered the ribeye for lunch. It comes with the skinny fries but can be substituted. It's also not on the lunch menu but typically still available unlike the roasted chicken and double cut pork chop that are truly only available for dinner. I got the Hawaiian/pineapple version as you can also choose to have it with basic seasonings. As usual it was delicious. I started with the deviled eggs. You can never go wrong with those. I also find it hard to come here and not have the cast iron corn bread but that's just way too much for a party of one. My steak was cooked to a perfect medium well. I always shocked at how many restaurants get the temperature of a steak wrong. To top it all off, when I asked for the check, my server informed me that another patron had covered my bill before they left."}
{"text":"Good dining experience: food was ok and service on point Dined here on our anniversary in Sept. Only thing was that it was so busy and there was a lot of staff going up and down, noise from the kitchen: could hear plates being stacked etc. If you are looking for a quiet romantic dining experience with some type of ambience, you will not find that here. Ideal for maybe a family or business dinner."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite restaurants in the area. The service is outstanding, the team service works really well here. We always felt like we were taken care of and had what we needed at all times. Hany, one of the managers was such a nice guy! He stopped by our table to check how everything was tasting and had us all laughing at the end of the conversation.   The grilled artichokes are delicious, especially with the dipping sauce. I love the kale salad and the veggie burger is the best veggie burger I've ever had! It is made with beets and black beans, giving it the look and texture of a real burger.  Overall the dining experience was very enjoyable. Service was perfect and food was superb! We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time there last night. Make a res this place gets packed. Ribs were amazing. We will be back"}
{"text":"Had a later lunch on Tuesday, but since we were having a dinner out my wife and I split the Awesome roast beef and Caesar salad. It's pricey $16 for the roast beef, but the best around, always rare with au jus and a side or horse radish, yummy. The salad was tasty doused with grated cheese, a bit too heavy with the dressing, but still very good. Great service by the 131 team, really have their act together. Out ultimate server, Sarah was excellent. She made sure that anything we needed or wanted was addressed."}
{"text":"I have seen reviews of this resturant in the past and being it was my birthday my girlfriend wanted us to go here. What can I say well the service was great and the waitess are very friendly. I did order the cornbread that was recommended to us but I wasn't very please nor my girlfriend. The waitess was so sweet she took it off the bill and gave us another free app. I didn't even ask for anything. I had the bar-b-que ribs. They use a sweet sauce that was very good. I would go back again and I plan on it soon."}
{"text":"We just had a lovely Sunday meal at 131 Main near Lake Norman. Appetizer was their own smoked salmon with toast points and aioli spread. Judy had the prime rib rare; and it was....a beautiful cut of beef. I had the shrimp and grits with a fabulous sauce that included asparagus tips and Smithfield ham; just the right amount of heat in the sauce. We were too full to try the key lime pie. Good looking place, nice location just off I 77, and I liked the TV on ESPN over the urinal in the restroom. Service, ambience, quality of food, freshness, all qualify this place for the four stars. See Photos."}
{"text":"If I had to sum up my experience in one word it wold be \"AMAZING\". Well worth the wait and the price.  The chef understands the balance that is needed to create a culinary experience and the staff make you feel like the most important person in the restaurant.  I highly recommend 131 to anyone wishing to not only be fed, but to be treated to an eating experience. As I say \"adventure is out there\" and 131 is a place to gain an eating adventure. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Omg. This place never disappoints me. The island Ribeye is what I get each and every time. I get mashed potatoes with it instead of fries. It is the best money I ever spend when I eat out. It is consistently delicious. And the 131 Maniac martini is on point. Anytime I want to treat myself I head to 131 Main."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice for lunch. Loved the tuna salad so much that I ordered it both times.  Hubby ordered grilled fish and grilled zucchini , both were incredible.  I think anything grilled would be good here. We also ordered the peanut and ginger cole slaw.  It was yummy! The only thing we were not overly impressed with was the banana cream pie.  It was good...but nothing overly impressive.  We went for lunch both times and they were very busy.  The atmosphere inside is fairly loud , so we ate outside where it was much more peaceful."}
{"text":"great ribs and slaw. prices have gone way up so we don't visit as offend as we used to. shame. Avoid the booze. whiskey sour had very little whiskey. I'm a non drinker so it hits me half way through but I felt nothing with it. Harbor Club in Mooresville also has watered down pina coladas."}
{"text":"Food and service is amazing everytime we have gone there. The cornbread is to die for!"}
{"text":"Always excellent.  World's best $5 gazpacho (big enough for two) and delicious.  Key Lime pie is alone worth stopping for.  Burgers, fish, steaks are all done well here.  Best atmosphere in the area.  Awesome for a couple, but our whole family has enjoyed it too.  Mashed potatoes are a personal favorite.  Never had a bad meal here.  Superb American fare."}
{"text":"We love 131 Main! The service was great, the food was tasty, and the atmosphere was comfortable. The menu has some classic items as well as some more unique items. We had sea bass and salmon, which were both incredible. We also ordered drinks and were impressed with how quickly they were delivered and with their quality. Customer service is really seamless and not overbearing. We've been twice and will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Brought some friends for dinner tonight!! Marty was incredibly helpful in making the reservation and also when we got there!  First time having the Thai Steak Salad....TO DIE FOR....fabulous....this will be something I will be having again and again and again guaranteed!!!  Also, a new addition Peanut Butter Pie for dessert was AMAZING!! As always 131 Main does not fail to provide a fabulous dining experience.  One of my all time favorite places for a dinner out!!"}
{"text":"We went to 131 Main for lunch, we probably should have looked up some reviews before we went but we enjoyed it! This place isn't the most kid friendly restaurant, they didn't have a kids menu or if they did we didn't see it. The food is great, we had the club sandwich, grouper sandwich blackened, and the double dip appetizer. This would be a great date night restaurant, it has dim lighting, which helps with the mood! The service was awesome, there were not many people in there for lunch on a Saturday. The prices range from $13-21. Worth a try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Better to sit at the bar. The smoked salmon and grilled artichoke appetizer is amazing. Great bar service! Definitely check out for date night!"}
{"text":"Came here Monday for lunch. We were seated immediately with no wait, but after we were seated and given our water, it took our waitress quite a while to come to our table to take our orders. Not sure why either because the place was not packed at all.   As for the food, that's another story. The food was great. I had ribs and fries and she had the crab cakes and asparagus. Both meals were great and we wished we had more lol.   Average service but the food was simply amazing. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Best veggie burger I had by far! The burger is so moist (not dry at all) and the portion is HUGE so your definitely getting your $$ worth. I like how their stuff is \"fresh\", the coleslaw tasted pretty fresh not mayonnaisey or anything. But some stuff on the menu is preeetty pricey but I think overall it's worth it!(: (4 stars because our waiter was pretty slow)"}
{"text":"My favorite LKN restaurant especially for date night! Best ribs around. Their desserts are so yummy. I have never had anything bad here."}
{"text":"I give this place five stars not because it's the best restaurant I've ever been to or really even compares that favorably to some mediocre places out in the Bay, but because, for the Charlotte area, this is as good as it gets.  The food here is yummy, though sometimes they are hit or miss with their veggies.  The meat is generally tasty and I've had about half the menu now, so I don't feel like one can generally go wrong.  I definitely recommend the Cornbread, as the delicious combination of sweet and spicy is phenomenal.    The downsides?  Well, the service is mixed, with many of the waitstaff either rude or clearly just putting on a fake smile.  The bar is iffy.  And the portions are WAY too big.  Like I said, this place doesn't compare favorably to a number of other places I've been, but is, by far, the best in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is top notch. Our waitress Jessica and the manager, Nick go absolutely above and beyond. The food is superb and the service is the best around. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food!! Great service!! I had to come back another day to get the dessert!! LOL!!"}
{"text":"Called in a takeout order. Overheard the staff on the phone saying they didn't know how to get a takeout order. Got my order placed, was told 10-15 minutes. Showed up on time, been waiting 30 minutes and counting so far. I know the food will be good as usual, but this is a little ridiculous for a simple chopped salad.  Ordered at 12:03, got to restaurant around 12:20, got order at 12:45.   My takeout bag was sitting across from me for about 5-10 minutes ready to go until the hostess in charge of takeouts remembered and gave it to me. I wish the other 2-3 hostesses that were standing around twiddling their thumbs could have checked, now I literally have 4 minutes left of my lunch break to actually eat.   If you're going to offer online ordering/takeout, it may be a good idea to have staff that can handle it and also approximate actual wait times so customers know what they are in for. $30+ for a salad and some cornbread may have been worth it if I didn't have to wait for 40 minutes to get it."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Houston's Restaurant in South Florida. It's a nice restaurant with a dark, intimate setting and the menu is short and sweet.   I made an appointment so I can't complain about wait times. The servers were all friendly and courteous and the food was A+!   My 12 oz Big Island Ribeye was so delicious and perfectly cooked that I didn't leave a thing on my plate. I skipped the fries and went for the mashed potatoes which were so good! The Double Cut Pork Chop is MASSIVE and can definitely be shared.   Their prices are reasonable compared to the quality and amount they serve. Their Key Lime Pie is a MUST! Being from Florida I haven't found any decent Key Lime Pie, but this place is top notch!"}
{"text":"If you love food, you will love 131 Main!!  I have been here as well as the Dilworth location several times and am never disappointed.  I really enjoy the team approach to service; you really feel special and very well taken care of.  BTW, 1/2 price bottled wine on Tuesdays....who can argue with that?!?!?"}
{"text":"I love love love this restaurant! Their mules are delicious! I have been here twice. The ribs are hands down to die for. They are flavorful and literally fall off the bone. My husband got the pork chop, I don't really recommend the pork chop because it was a little tasteless. But it might have been that one time. They probably would have replaced the dish if we said something but we were on a crunch for time.  I highly recommend their fries !! Ribs! and salads! Roasted artichokes!"}
{"text":"Ahi Tuna Salad. That's all I'm going to say. That and the Double Dip. Ok, that's two things. Whatever. Just go if you're reading this. People are lovely and helpful as well. Some are so helpful it's almost sarcastic, which is a fun game too."}
{"text":"The first meal was with kids, not knowing that the setting was more for date night. The server  wasn't very attentive or explanatory that night. Returned for date night and got the short guy that about trips on his aprin....he is GREAT!! The salmon appatizer is exquisite! Rainbow trout also great. Strawberry shortcake and banana pie also very very good!"}
{"text":"131 Main is my favorite place to eat lunch when I'm in the Cornelius/Lake Norman area. I'm down there about once a month, so I go to 131 every change I get. I stick to their salads for the most part, and they are huge. The \"top chopped\" salad is fantastic. Their cobb salad with chicken is also very good. I had the shrimp and grits once and it tasted like it came straight out of the low country of South Carolina.  For dessert, the banana cream pie is simply outstanding!   The service is as exceptional as the food. The servers seem to be highly trained and professional. I've never had any issues. Anything that needs to be fixed about the meal is addressed quickly. There is no doubt that this place is pricy, but in my view the service and the food are worth the money."}
{"text":"Our family's favorite place. Such great food, great service and atmosphere. The baby back ribs are outstanding! Could be the best in the region. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu frankly. It's always packed (a testament to the food) so make reservations if you can."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Monday night and the place was full. You walk in and immediately see the kitchen to the right where they are grilling; grilled meat smells wonderful! They were participating in Restaurant Week which includes three courses for $35. I started with the Caesar Salad and it was a bit overdressed for my taste but there was a nice garlic kick and overall it was tasty. For the entree I ordered two crab cakes that come in a bed of some kind of sauce. The crab cakes were high quality, not much filler, and very light and delicate. Very good cakes, but could have been served hotter. Mine were just warm, which means they sat for a bit. For dessert, I got the key lime pie and it was very good, light and tangy. Solid 4 stars for the food.  The service was attentive without being overbearing. 4.5 stars for service. The restaurant is upscale but not pretentious. 5 stars for ambience. I would say prices are reasonable to slightly high if you want a casual meal, but appropriate for a special occasion or to impress. Overall, a very nice restaurant to which I would return."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! The ribs are outstanding; especially with their unique fries! They occasionally offer a cold asparagus salad that is simply stunning. Also a sauteed spinach that just thinking about makes me hungry.  That said, I came in with my mother we had both just gotten out work.We were wearing our scrubs and I cannot be sure but it seemed we were turned away based on that. It was early still barely 5:00pm but we were told they had a \"very long wait\" we could see empty tables and no crowd. I inquired if there was a private party. The hostess snidely replied that the were all reservations. At five? all seats and tables are booked? Before that night we had never had any trouble getting in especially so early. The couple behind us MUST  have had a reservation they were ushered in.  Never had I nor have I since experienced that. If it was our manner of dress at five pm on a random Tuesday then I am shocked.... Like I said this had never happened before! I have not returned since then; that is causing major Key Lime Pie withdrawls!"}
{"text":"There is only one word to describe the cuisine at 131 Main...and that's WOW!  I have never been disappointed with a meal at this restaurant.  Service is top notch and location is very convenient.  I highly recommend this restaurant as one of my favorites on Lake Norman."}
{"text":"Stopped by 131 Main for dinner and had a great meal.    Started with the main salad.  Everything about it was really good.  The croutons were a nice touch.  I think that it was cornbread which was really good.    They just put a Lamb Shank with Red mashed potatoes back in the menu.  The Lamb was very tender and the flavor was awesome.   The mashed potatoes were a great compliment and really completed the meal.    My wife had the Cedar Plank Salmon.   She really enjoyed it and was going to get it the next time that we visit.    Overall they continue to provide a good quality meal.   Will repeat."}
{"text":"Been to 131 about 10 times and although it seems they have been getting more \"proud\" of their food prices, its still a great place. If you can stomach a $15 cheeseburger, it is very good! And 2 Martini's at the bar was a Manhattan-like $25. That said, love the smell of the wood-fired grill when walking in and the open kitchen that's always bustling.   Love the Kale Salad, Deviled Eggs(yes, yummy for an app), Salmon on Cedar Plank and any of the steaks. I had a Prime Rib last week and although the horseradish had lost its kick, they brought me back some that is still clearing my sinuses! Shrimp and Grits are solid, as is the Trout.   Solid restaurant! Service is always very good and if you're into smells and tastes of wood-fired meats and fish, 131 Main is a solid choice."}
{"text":"This was my first stop at this particular location of 131 Main and it did not disappoint!! The service is great and so is the food and consistent across the brand. I got the prime rib and it was out of this world delicious. The quinoa salad was amazing and the smoked salmon appetizer rocks my world every single time. They're also family friendly which is a plus."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a friend. The service was speedy and attentive. We shared the deviled egg appetizer. The eggs were terrific. Sweet filling with a note of tarragon. For my main course, I had the 131 Club. Fantastic. I am a club sandwich man and have eaten them all over the country. This is a top-10 entry for sure. Some of the tastiest honey mustard I've ever had. We skipped dessert but saw several come out and they looked very yummy. 131 Main is a solid choice even if just a tad overpriced.  131 Main: B+"}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit to 131 Main and it was the best one yet.   We visited during Restaurant Week and we were treated to a three course meal that was off the charts!  Cesar salads with anchovies, cedar planked salmon, ribs, crab cakes and roasted chicken were all excellent.  Also, try the Brussel sprouts.  A real treat!  The place puts the fine in fine dining.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I love 131 it is my go to restaurant every location is great food and service. The marinated ribeye is the best thing I've ever eaten. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Crab cake salad is delicious, server Carla was wonderful, great Saturday afternoon lunch.. but GM Billy did not visit our table to see how our meal was, but we watched him visit every table in the restaurant, which was not busy as usual, might have something to do with the color of our skin...."}
{"text":"Mmmm baby back ribs. Creamy delicious slaw. Full rack of fall off the bone meat. Portions are out of control. An excellent choice for a fine dining option, although the staff doesn't seem that put together.   Note in the apps since it is the most reviewed: The pimento and gauc dip is excellent. The honey corn bread is not as good as everyone says, and defintely not for that price.   Get the ribs. Mmm the ribs."}
{"text":"Better experience this time l! Sat at bar very attentive, more enjoyable than our last experience and food was beyter"}
{"text":"First off, 131 Main does not have any freezers. To me, that is impressive and screams Fresh Food!!!  We started off with cocktails and have to say the Martini Maniac packs quite a punch! Thank goodness for the  hot skillet cornbread, that was an appetizer and almost like cake. Who doesn't want to start with dessert first????!!!!  Three of the four of us, had the fresh grouper, over cheese grits , that was fantastic. This was not a small piece of of fish, but a large piece that was perfectly blackened. The cheese grits had a spicy bite to them, that went perfect with the grouper!   Although we were stuffed, we had to get the dessert of banana pie and it was light, tasty and had huge chunks of fresh bananas in it.   I cannot stress enough how fresh the fish was. We have a second home in Florida and we felt like were literally down in Florida on the gulf, eating fish. We could not get over it and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went to 131 Main on a Friday without a reservation.  DOH...like who does that?  I hadn't been to this particular location, but have been to the other location. Was initially told the wait for a table was 1 hour.  I put my name on the list.  Lo and behold the hostess called my name after a short 20 minute wait!! #winning  The waitstaff was very attentive and our waitress Caroline was super sweet and accommodating (my friend was very picky in how they wanted things prepared).  Food was delicious and drinks were top notch!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for Christmas Eve with 15 people and the only thing that was disappointing was they don't have tables that go together . We all had to sit at separate tables . The tables are bolted to the floor so they can't put them together . They didn't tell us that over the phone but they made it right by giving us some free appetizers. The food is always very good with huge portions . The staff is high end and very attentive . I always have leftovers and no room for dessert . Overall a great place but not for big Parties  ."}
{"text":"131 Main for Queens feast was a perfect end to a hard week! We ordered the ribs and crab cakes for our entrees. The ribs was perfect and the crab cakes was great as well the string beans were seasoned just right as well as The asparagus. The service was excellent and the wait staff was very attentive. Can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"Fresh and flavorful food at a great value. The Asian salad is an amazing entrée. Very consistent food and the service is typically very good. Nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Well, I can walk to 131 which is so nice. The burger is fantastic. I love the artichoke appetizer and the bar is cozy and romantic. Our server remembered us And what we drink!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and every time I get the grilled artichokes.  They are addicting!"}
{"text":"Great food. Atmosphere ok. But service a C. No birthday desert was offered. It was a Friday night and there were a ton of servers there, so it should have been better."}
{"text":"The double decker appetizer is great. It comes with guacamole and pimento cheese to dip your chips into. I love it and I don't typically eat pimento cheese but theirs is very good. The banana creme pie is what put this place on the map. You must try it. No bones about it."}
{"text":"Irritating when you have a reservation and you still wait 25 minutes for a table.   The staff was pleasant but I doubt we will be back.  I made a reservation for a reason.  There are plenty of other good places in Cornelius, Davidson, and Huntersville to settle."}
{"text":"Wow another place outside of Charlotte that was PACKED for dinner in a Tuesday!  I think this area is going to take over Houston as the city with the most people who dine out idled their home.    Tucked a way in some office type buildings, is this little place, dark with a intimate ambiance, great bar that seats about 50 people and an open kitchen concept right when you walk in the front door.    Trust me when I say get the double dip!  Fresh guacamole and COLD Queso.  I know it sounds gross to us Tex-Mex fans but to their credit, they don't lost what the double dip is.  My dining partner had it once and told me ya got to try this!  I did and I'll never look back.  It has a spicy smoky flavor.  Looks like pimento cheese, but so much better!  You have to trust me and try it.   I had the salad with a crab cake.  Dressing was very light and not overwhelming, and the creamy mustard sauce for the crab cake was divine.  Not too mustard tasting, just enough tang to make it good.  Crab cake is not the best, the meat tastes frozen and it was flakey mean not chunks.  It was hand made because, to its credit,'it was not over breaded and not dull of bel peppers or other veggie color/fillers that I think this asthetic my pleasing, not necessary in a good crab cake.  My dining companion had the filet and it came out raw when he asked for medium.  It got sent back and it came back almost well.  But again, to their credit, they asked him to cut the steak to make sure it was diene right.  When the waiter realized it was not, she took it back to fox the problem.    If I ever come back here I will defiantly come back to eat here.  Great service and the food was on par with the pricing"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. It's a little loud, prolly not the best place for a dinner meeting.   Only had soup and an app and gotta say a little disappointed by both.   The potato soup was standard family diner fair, the deviled eggs were mayo and too much chopped gherkin pickle.   Sorry I didn't like it more."}
{"text":"We always stopped when this restaurant was in Dillsworth.  It has lost some of its ambiance but the food and service are still great.  A favourite of my husband is the grilled artichokes as an appetizer and I love the prime rib roast beef dip.  The shoestring fries are a special treat."}
{"text":"131 Main has always been one of my favorite restaurants. It never disappoints. The menu is great and the food is always fresh and delicious. The ambience is very romantic and my husband and I will keep this as one of go-to place for date night"}
{"text":"Wifey and I stopped back in one of our favorite Charlotte restaurants while in the area.  We had to have the Awesome Roast Beef Sandwich!  It was as good as we remembered it!  True roast beef, sliced thin, piled high...with skinny fries and Au Jus...excellent!  Also had the Deviled Eggs...more goodness!  131 Main is consistent in delivering quality food and good service.  All own their locations have lived up to equal billing?"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant of all time!!! The food is fresh, service is awesome, and atmosphere amazing!  Whether you are looking for a special night out or just a sunday lunch this place is great!  I recommend the Main Salad (yum!) and the cedar plank salmon!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Lake Norman Area. Always good food and service. I don't eat beef often, but when I crave a steak, the teriyaki marinated rib eye here is the best! This eve, I ordered one for take out. When I  got home, it wasn't cooked like I requested. I returned it and Manager Brad was the most  accommodating  ever!  He ordered another steak ( cooked to perfection), offered a drink on the house, brought me a delicious cornbread appetizer, and offered complimentary dessert...excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"I get the roast beef sandwich and share it with the wedge every time. It's amazing. I have never had anything bad here. The artichokes and the double dip are my favorite apps. they have 1/2 price bottles of wine on tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Almost a 5.  Everything was great.  Food was fresh and well seasoned.  Staff was friendly.  Overall excellent experience.  Only reason I went with a 4 instead of 5 is that nothing surprised me.  We got the double dipper, house salad with blue cheese vinegarette, ribeye steak and key lime pie.  I will be back."}
{"text":"We have been eating here for years, it's always a go to place for high quality fresh food. My most recent experience on 3/11/18 was quite the opposite.  I ordered the seared tuna mango salad. It was supposed to be mixed fresh greens with avocado, I ordered the tuna seared, but rare. When my salad came, the tuna was so overdone, I thought it was steak. There was NO avocado, two small squares of mango, and no fresh greens....it was 90% iceberg lettuce and 10% dried out cabbage shreds. The server went back to the chef who did very little to make it right other than add 3 small squares of avocado. Highly disappointed and hope this is not the new standard for 131 Main."}
{"text":"Great food! The banana cream pie is out of this world. The pic I took doesn't do it justice. Go check it out for yourself!  :)"}
{"text":"Party of 5 had a fabulous meal during restaurant week.  Arrived early for our reservation and was seated early.   Plus 1.  Tiffany was our server and she very attentive and made great suggestions.   Fun wine selection and we were offered samples, which was helpful for deciding.   For appetizers most ordered the Caesar salad and it was delicious.   I had to be odd man out so I ordered cornbread and another ordered the deviled eggs so we could share. Deviled eggs were tasty and the corn bread with honey were amazing. Best corn bread ever.  My crab cakes and asparagus were perfect. Crab cakes are fluffy, just how I like them.  Ribeye with marinade for restaurant week was a compliment to a great cut of meat.  Mashed potatoes were fluffy and not overly gooey. The salmon.   Mmmmm.  Nothing more they said. So also very good.  Finally the desserts. Save a little room and you won't regret it except at your next workout. Lol. Peanut butter pie with freshly made graham cracker crust. To die for. Seriously.  So happy I had over half to bring home. Hubby had the key lime pie. He swears it's better. It was very good, but I was in a peanut butter and chocolate mood.  Banana creme pie...  It's different, but again. Wow. So good.  That's not on the restaurant week menu, but everything is reasonable so don't feel limited to their special menu.  Great service and the ambience were amazing.  We will be back.  I'm very impressed."}
{"text":"131 Main is a solid experience.  They fix problems and do so in a way that really helps you feel confident that they understand hospitality.  I had a big problem with 131 Main and they fixed it.  Avoiding problems is the best, but being able to fix problems is another huge plus (nobody can always be perfect and it is nice to know if they aren't perfect you aren't totally out of luck).  Call this my cable rule.  If you get cable and it works then everything is perfect.  If anything goes wrong with your cable, welcome to an endless hell of never getting anything done right.  131 Main isn't like the cable company - problems get solved.  The food here is very good, I am a little sad to see some of my favorites disappear from the menu - bye bye lamb.  They still have plenty of wonderful options.  Appetizers - they are ok, but I would skip them and focus on the entrees and desert as both of these are much better experiences.  Entrees - they know how to cook a steak and they know how to cook fish.  They have a menu with enough variety to let you experiment and it is worth exploring all of it.  Dessert - I am not a huge dessert guy, and I wish they had some more options, but what they do have in the way of chocolate cake is very pleasing.  Parking - you can find parking but you may have to walk through a lot of parking lot.  If you make a reservation, make sure you get it confirmed.  I left some voice mail and didn't get a response back.  I followed up and didn't get a response.  Make sure you get a confirmation of your party size and the date/time of your reservation."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting this restaurant. The first time was years ago and to be honest don't really remember what I ordered or much about this restaurant in general. Tonight we had Jackie as our server and her customer service was excellent. She was very attentive and super sweet! I ordered the special which was the filet medallions with blue cheese crumbles and red mashed potatoes. My husband ordered the rainbow trout and got a side of green beans. The food was excellent! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great lunch here today.  Service was very friendly and they really went the extra mile in all aspects. We were a party of four adults, two kids and an infant and we all had a fabulous time and enjoyed ourselves.  The crab cake salad was really nice, it wasn't breaded at all and the entire cake was just real crab. I kept stealing the shoestring fries that came with my cousin's burger, sorry bud, they were just so good.  At the end of the meal Aaron came around and asked those who had sodas if they wanted a cup to go (how nice is that? I've never heard that before) and he also offered to bring out complimentary ice cream for the kids! Love me some southern hospitality :) can't wait to come back next time I'm in town visiting the fam."}
{"text":"Over priced...not worth the time the $ or the wait. My salad had so much dressing and just mush...won't go back even if it's free"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to enjoy a meal at 131 Main. Though I have eaten at the restaurant before this was my first time at this location. I was VERY impressed with the service - beyond friendly and everyone had a sincere smile on their face.   I would give five stars alone to the jalapeno corn-bread which is downright incredible. Served with a drizzle of honey in an individual cast-iron skillet. Much to my fiances chagrin I am not a fan of corn-bread but this stuff could make me one.   For my entree I ordered the prime rib which was super delicious and prepared perfectly rare as requested.  The creamy horseradish also had a nice zing....no weak-sauce here!   For dessert my friend and I went with the banana pie and key lime which were both delectable. The crust was a thick gram-cracker style which I especially enjoyed.   Overall I left stuffed to the brim ...so much so that my bed immediately called me because I couldn't move! If you're starving go here and eat a lot and then sleep...it's a very nice combination!"}
{"text":"4 stars based on appetizers and a wonderful bartender?? You're darn right!! Sometimes, the best things are right under your nose. 131 Main is less than 5 miles from my job and I ventured out after work to meet up with one of my girlfriends. She's always getting kale salad, so I decided to try it. OMG! It was delicious and so good for you. I also got the Double Dip with a double portion of the pimento queso. Such an interesting twist on a southern staple. It was so good that when I got home, I look on the internet to see if I could duplicate the recipe. The appetizers alone were worth 2 stars. Prices weren't bad either.  Secondly...my intention was to have a glass of wine but was a little to tired to drink so I got water but sat at the bar. The bartender was Mian (like Neon) and she was hysterical. She was very engaging and kept a good conversation going. To sum up 131 Main, I'll use something Mian said to me.  \"This is the only restaurant that I've ever worked at, in my life, that I'll bring my friends to... on my day off and spend more money than I made the night before.\"~Mian the Bartender  I'll definitely be back...again and again."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in LKN. The ribs are to die for. The wedge salad is remarkable and the steaks are delicious. Beware of the wait times, even with a reservation. I had the shaved prime rib sandwich the last time and it's phenomenal, not to mention the fresh cut fries and the grilled asparagus. This place is a must if you are looking for nice night out with the wife!"}
{"text":"Very nice place. Classy interior. Had a group of 8 on a wknd night. Had reservation, but table delayed. The Mgr was outstanding. He checked on our Grp In the bar multiple times. Brought drinks, apps, and a great attitude. Food was excellent. Grilled salmon perfect. We will return."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of 131 Main and have been for a while!  When they say \"Awesome Roast Beef Sandwich\", one would think... that's bold and cocky.  I can't think of a better name for it though!  It's that good!    I would recommend basically anything on the menu so go with that which you crave!  If you want a sandwich, the burger and roast beef sandwich are easy winners and served with fantastic shoestring fries.  If you want a salad, they are great (may I recommend the Thai Steak Salad : my favorite and it's different!).   Desserts are along the same lines.  Fantastic options and they don't disappoint.  A great value for the money.  We tend to go on half price wine night!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Friendly service, and good food. Decent wine selection and a section with just tall tables and a bar.  It was busy on a wednesday evening, so I think you'll want to call ahead and get reservations.  The best way to describe this place is a neighbourhood restaurant , but more classy, with great service and good food. Nothing special about the menu, but just classics done very well.  I had their filet mignon and it was sized correctly, not too big but big enough to satisfy, I think it was 8oz. Prices are fair.  Service is cordial and prompt."}
{"text":"Food was good. Restaurant was clean. Advance reservations worked well. Service is what got two stars. Service was what you would expect at Waffle House. I was not finished with my meal and my server took my plate.  Had to ask for another plate and fork to finish My sides. Manager said it was \"their silent service \".  Been to 131 Main many times. Will not return."}
{"text":"Good food, pricey but good, servers so/so. Nice ambience and adequate parking."}
{"text":"131 Main has some amazing entrees. The Southern Shrimp and grits, crab cakes or filets are always my go-to meals. The atmosphere is perfect for a family dinner or fun date night. On the patio, there is a nice fire pit, that is fun to sit around in the winter. Every time I have been, I always finish my night with a piece of key lime pie."}
{"text":"The ribs were awesomeeeee. Their shoestring fries were also amazing. The slaw that came with the ribs was not my favorite and I LOVE coleslaw. It had some flowery flavor to it and the peanuts did just not go with the dish. Other than that, the service was great, although she REALLY tried to get me to buy a bottle of wine which was sort of annoying but that's sales for ya. For desert we had banana cream pie but the chocolate chunks in it was too much. I like bananas and chocolate but it was just overpowering."}
{"text":"I love 131 Main!!!! Grilled trout! Wild rice salad! Banana cream pie! Good wine & main salad! All Awesome! But maybe that's because I drank the bottle of wine! Anyway...I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. And every time I have not been disappointed. Here's the catch though, I never get anything else but the baby back ribs, with coleslaw and French fries. So to ask me about the rest of the menu is a complete waste of time. With that said, the ribs are the best. I can easily blow through a full rack at a sitting with no problem at all. Why? Well it's not because I'm a big guy that has a ridiculous appetite. 5'9, 150. It's because the ribs are so good that I am not even thinking about how full I am. The meat falls off the bone. The sauce is insane. And throw in a shoestring fries and delicious coleslaw and I am happier than a pig in... Do yourself a favor and get the ribs!! On a side note, my wife last year ordered the catch of the day and she said it was good. Now she only gets the ribs. Nice servers and a nice looking, clean place too."}
{"text":"Best crab cake I've ever had and loved kale salad! Had a shrimp with grits for the first time in my life and it was good too. My youngest daughter (6yrs) says everyone needs to try their fish taco :)"}
{"text":"I haven't been here to eat in around 10 years when I was on the staff that opened the restaurant. So for this Valentine's Day, I decided to take my fiancé to the restaurant that I had raved about but never taken her to over the years. Well, long story short the food is still terrific, but the service is sub par. Our server was obviously trying to get the hell outta there. We ordered the artichokes, half way through 1 of 3, our entrees show up. That tells me he fired our entree order at the same time as our app. I paid $12 for 3 halves of a grilled veggie; I would have liked to have enjoyed some of it. The server dropping off the entrees, runs as soon as the plates hit the table before I have a chance to ask for some Horsey sauce for my prime rib. No problem, server should by soon (2 bite rule). Wrong, half way through the meal he strolls by, and it's not like he was in the weeds... The restaurant was half empty at this point. No, he's off somewhere doing side work. Don't see him again until entree is finished. We get the banana cream pie, which is just as delicious as I remember. I cash out and leave him an 18% tip even though he deserved 8. I know he wanted to get out of there, I've been there. I understand. Still didn't change the fact that I paid a premium price for a sub par product."}
{"text":"Business trip. Met Julie. See her now. Lovely and fun and knowledgeable. Delicious food and wine."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I've been to 131 Main several times, and while I think they are a slight notch below Dressler's in terms of the food, they are still a good place to have dinner with family or friends.     One thing I thought I'd mention is how dark and dim the restaurant appears when you first walk in.  While my eyes always adjust, I would appreciate if they would improve on the lighting.    If you have not heard of the 131 Main Event, I highly recommend you try that.  You get one appetizer, two salads, two entrees, one dessert, and one bottle of wine (Pinot Grigio or Cabernet) for $65.  It's an even better deal than Restaurant Week (3 for $30), and its offered daily!  If you don't want the wine, subtract $10 and add your own beverages.  Recently, we tried the \"Event.\"  We couldn't decide between the cornbread and deviled eggs, so we ordered the eggs as an extra appetizer.  The problem was, both dishes were too sweet for us.  The cornbread serving was huge, light, and moist.  But we didn't really like the sweet (honey-crusted) top.  I would have preferred a cheese crust to go along with the cheese and jalapeño filling.  For those of you who like deviled eggs, you probably have strong feelings of which type you like - sweet or savory.  Of course, I prefer the savory version, and 131 serves a sweet one.  They generously fill their eggs, but they were made with sweet relish, and that totally turned me off.  If you don't mind the sweetness, I'm sure you'll love them.  My hubby and I both had the Main Salad and they offered their house garlic mayo dressing in place of ranch.  Both of our salads were overly dressed, and once again, the dressing was too sweet.    I had the trout previously and really enjoyed it, but now that I've had the shrimp and grits, that's my new favorite entree.  It's spicy and creamy, and the shrimp were perfectly cooked.  Served with cheddar grits, I enjoyed every bite.    My hubby usually gets the ribeye, and they always cook it perfectly.  Their mashed potatoes are also creamy and delicious.  For dessert, we have only tried the banana cream pie.  It is a huge portion, and is really good.  I can't forget to mention the service, because 131's service is truly stellar.  We sat in the bar, and never wanted for anything.  They paid close attention to where we were in our meal, and we rarely waited longer than a couple of minutes for our next course.  Overall, you won't make a bad choice by going to 131 Main for dinner.  And if you like sweet dishes, you'll probably love them even more."}
{"text":"My family and I had another great dining experience with 131 Main tonight. Before dinner I had a very good dirty martini with stuffed blue cheese olives (Dirty Tito) & my wife enjoyed an excellent Sauvignon Blanc. We started with the soup of the day, Mushroom & Artichoke (Yum) and the kids split the Double Dip (chips & salsa/guac/pimento cheese).    For our entrees we had the Braised Lamb Shank, Danish Baby Back Ribs, Sterling Prime Rib Sandwich and the fish special with crab sauce. Everything was wonderful, but the Ribs were my favorite. The atmosphere and service are always incredible so if you haven't tried 131 Main you should treat yourself and give them a try. Thanks to our waiter Jonathan for taking good care of us!  E. Dyer"}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday celebration sept 2013 with my wife. We are regular visitors and the food is usually really good.  We ordered ribeye and they were not cooked correctly to our liking.  We sent them back because they were tough. The waitress came and apologized for the mistake and let us know that the manager will be talking to us. We saw the manager peak out the door.. we were sitting outside and he decided not to come to our table.   I guess he felt we were going to make a scene or something.  Were very disappointed he didnt even bother coming to the table.  I guess he was afraid since we were not of his ethnicity.  The server was great. The asst manager dropped off our food and never apologized for the mistake.  I havent been back since."}
{"text":"Delicious food. The ribs are, hands down, the best I've ever had. They fall right off the bone. You could eat them with a fork and knife if you want. One star taken off because they tend to rush you out of the Lake Norman location on weekends since there is usually a wait. I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went to 131 Main last night for dinner to celebrate my Birthday. Auburn was our server and helped us have a fantastic experience. She told us about the specials, and was quick to bring us drinks and food. She always checked back in just the right amount of time to where we didn't feel forgotten, and it wasn't too much. So thank you Auburn I feel like good service is hard to come by!  For the food, I had crab cakes and Brussels sprouts. They were delicious! The crab cakes were full or crab and not fillers. The sauce on the plate was mild and not too strong. My fiancé had the ribs with Cole slaw and fries (they don't have ranch for dipping but Auburn brought some creamy garlic cause that was better than ranch). The ribs were seriously fall off the bone, fries were cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the Cole slaw was way better than any slaw we've had before.   For desert we had the banana cream pie which is out of this world! The portion is so large, it would feed 4-6 people. We couldn't even put a dent in it.  All in all we had an excellent experience with excellent food here and we will be returning!"}
{"text":"I don't know if its because its a bit more expensive than my typical weekend out, or if it's that it is indeed a bit hidden, but I am always so beyond impressed when I leave 131... yet don't find myself returning for months!  The apps are always good, although there aren't too many to chose from,  and I absolutely love their steak! My husband seems to love their prime rib but that isn't quite my thing.  I also think the ambiance here is great, cozy and can be super romantic if you are looking for a date night!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with 131 Main. The service was professional and the food was delicious! I ordered the Prime Rib (which was a special that evening) and couldn't have been happier. We sat at the bar because it was so busy and I actually liked it better. I will definitely go back to 131 Main again in the future."}
{"text":"Met a friend for dinner here last week. We ordered drinks but passed on the appetizer. Among our order was lamb shank, ribs and crab cakes. All were very good. Near the end, the manager stopped by to see how it was. Then he informed us that our entrees would be comped because it took longer than the acceptable 20 minutes. I've never had this happen before and was quite impressed with their attention to detail. Food was excellent, service solid and management very attentive to details. Will be back.   The one drawback is the parking lot doesn't have enough parking. And we were here on Wednesday night, so I can only imagine what it is like on the weekends."}
{"text":"The Island Ribeye is something from another planet. It was so good that I distracted someone in my party to steal a bite after I was done with mine. Rude? Eh.   Good fries. Pretty good ribs.   Beer: Stella from bottle followed by White Zombie draft. Both good, but draft better. Really good water here too. I might be the first person to review water, but it is actually really good.   Service was excellent. They forgot straws requested by others for a while, but no big deal. Last night, I watched Below Deck: Mediterranean and the primary (primary guest) asked for nuts. They didn't arrive in time, and she kept saying to her friends in a whiny voice, \"I want my nuts. Where are my nuts? I want my nuts!\" I'm not going to lie; I was laughing my ass off. So, I didn't want to be \"that guy\" or \"that person\" with the straws. I like to have fun. Therefore, it's a good thing I didn't think of asking the waitress if they had nuts. If it was a \"No,\" I might have gone on and on with, \"I want my nuts. Where are my nuts? I want my nuts!\" I would have done it quietly and in a friendly/joking way though.   The conversation was good, which you might think had nothing to do with 131 Main, but you would be sorely mistaken. You see, the lights are dim, the service is friendly, the alcohol is flowing, and the food is way above average. This leads to a good mood and quality conversation, such as my Great Gram Gene always sticking her permanently crooked middle finger out to people and saying, \"Five doctors for one f*cking finger!\"   131 Main is expensive. $30 tip tonight. Should give you an idea.   Overall, a very good experience. Always recommended.   btw, Just got new phone. More pics in near future. Sorry, I know I have been slacking in that area."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place because it reminds us of one of our favorite restaurants in CA, Houston's Same decor, same outfits, good service, good food.  Specifically, we have ordered and enjoyed the prime rib, rib eye, pork chops. Also, the Roast Beef Sandwich was amazing!  Very reliable and is always a good option when we can't decide where we want to eat or take our friends"}
{"text":"By far THE BEST cheeseburger I have EVER  had. Bun is perfectly crisp. Not overcooked. Add a little curry flavored rice and crispy thin cut fries? HEAVEN! Also love the cornbread, artichokes, ribs and strawberry shortcake. My favorite restaurant in all of North Carolina  Also - BEST location. Open kitchen as you walk in. Has a lot of character. Way better than Dilworth."}
{"text":"We love this location of 131 Main. I recommend the baby back ribs and the prime rib. The mushroom and artichoke soup. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is one of those times that I bemoan the fact that you can't give a half star to reviews.  After a couple of days of deliberating, my stars for 131 Main are a solid 3.5.  Since I had to choose a 3 or 4 I went with 4 because the staff here is so nice.  It's been awhile since I've been here, the menu is just \"that side\" of pricey by a few dollars on each item that I tend to choose other places with similar menus and better prices.    We were greeted by a delightful hostess who was friendly and helpful, even with an already packed restaurant and seated by another hostess who was just as nice.  I point this out because to a man, there wasn't anyone working the evening we went who wasn't helpful or friendly.  And there were a LOT of people working.  So, 5 stars on staff personality.  The restaurant itself is very, very pretty.  Many booths makes for intimate dining, including booths for 6 but it was in that upscale, manly booth way, not the diner booth way.  I very much wanted to take a picture to show atmosphere but I couldn't because it is so dark in the restaurant you can't see... anything.  All of my pictures below were adjusted as much as I could because the lighting is horrendous.    I held my menu this way and that, near the fake candle and under a dim overhead light before admitting defeat.  I couldn't read anything on the menu!!!!  Happily, I of course spent the week deliberating my Restaurant Week menu choices, but if I hadn't I'd have had to have asked the server to read me the entire menu.  I wish I was exaggerating but I'm not, it is that dim in there.  You can't see anything.  Our server was friendly and came promptly for drink orders.  We liked him a lot but then I overheard the server at the next table over killing it with the specials presentation which our server had forgotten to share with us.  I was iffy on the Restaurant Week menu to start with (the other couple had chosen) and I had half a mind to order off the regular menu but since I couldn't read the menu and he didn't present the specials, I just didn't.  Sodas here come in small glass bottles.  I'm not sure if they charge per bottle (I forgot to look at the receipt after we left) but I suspect they must.  Drinks were brought promptly, so promptly that we actually accidentally got a second round within 10 minutes of the first, which the restaurant kindly comped. (Turn down a free glass of wine?  Not me!)   When our friends arrived they were also offered drinks and an introduction to the server in a timely basis.    After ordering our meals we received appetizers in short order, probably in about 4 minutes.  However, they were for another table.  Two minutes later our own correct appetizers were served, like magic they were instantly ready.  (I'd noticed that the appetizer menu were all items easily and quickly whipped up in the back):  MAIN Salad - chopped egg, bacon & cornbread croutons  (very good)  Caesar Salad - fresh Reggiano cheese & cornbread croutons (it's just me, but I loathe cornbread.  I tried one because they were clearly homemade and hand fried, but I still hated it.  I think cornbread lovers would rejoice over these croutons though).  Just a fun fact, I saw a lot of tables ordering the cornbread appetizer off the regular menu so it must be good.  Deviled Eggs (4) - our creamy homemade mixture garnished with parsley (average, at best, was the verdict)  While eating I saw servers try to give dishes to wrong tables another two times.  There seemed to be a lot of servers and back waiters and likely limited communication between them all which was kind of curious to me as this is a long-time, well established restaurant that is well versed in Restaurant Week volume.  Dinner entrees tried by our table included: Maryland-Style Crab Cakes - two jumbo lump crab cakes served over pommerey mustard sauce with jumbo grilled asparagus ($25 on the regular menu).  Good crab cakes, minimal filler and the mustard sauce was not sharp, it was more mild which I appreciated as I'd recently eaten an entree with mustard sauce that overwhelmed the plate.  131 Main's mustard sauce was much, much better.  Served with jumbo asparagus spears (again, it's just me but I like medium or thin spears, they're not as stringy as jumbo).  Sterling Silver Ribeye - 14 oz., cut in-house, simply grilled over hickory wood and served with hand-cut fries ($31 similar Ribeye on the regular menu).  Steak was very good.  Served with mashed potatoes that evening instead of the fries listed on the menu.   Desserts - we tried them all.  All were generously sized and prettily presented. Key Lime Pie - good, with a very dense homemade whipped cream  Brownie a la Mode - very pretty  Peanut Butter Pie - enormous, and you better love peanut butter.  Light in texture, heavy in PB taste, you'll have leftovers  So, all in all, I like this place.  But the combination of the impossible lighting and just a stitch too expensive than everyone else is what gives me pause."}
{"text":"Always have a great experience at 131 Main.  We had the crab cakes and the marinated ribeye... Phenomenal!!  Staff was great as always and very helpful.  Decent beer and wine selection."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant. Amazing staff. Wonder menu options. Love the fresh grouper sandwiches and the salads are to die for. A place we always bring out of town guests!!"}
{"text":"Well. When it's on the company, might as well go out to a nicer lunch, right?  I've passed by the Dilworth location of 131 plenty of times, but never gone in. Little did I know that there was a location way up here in Huntersville (or is it Cornelius? Still figuring out the boundaries up here). We went here for lunch, so I can't really comment about dinner.  The ambiance is dark and intimate, which was a little strange for a lunch service. A cornucopia of eclectic 80's music played in the background, which I just didn't think fit. Although, if they were trying to make it a conversation piece, it worked.   The service was great! We were well taken care of, our server was attentive and timely. He knew where we worked and made sure to expedite our experience so we could return on time.  My coworker suggested that we get cornbread as an appetizer. This was definitely a unique spin on that: served in a cast iron skillet with a sweet, crunchy topping and a side of GOOD honey. Needless to say, it disappeared from our table pretty damn quickly.  I ordered the fish sandwich as my entree. Unfortunately, it was pretty bland. It looked nice, served with a fair amount of shredded lettuce, pickles, and a yummy aoili, but it just didn't meld in a great way, the way a sandwich that expensive should. My other coworkers ordered fish dishes as well, but I didn't get to figure out what their thoughts were.  Overall, don't take my 3 star rating to be *bad*. It just wasn't great. If given the opportunity, I'll still come back, don't worry 131 Main. This isn't a breakup."}
{"text":"Food is very good, service is also good. The prices seem to be a bit high so it has to reserved for special occasions. I woudl like to see a early bird special but all and all I would return. The crab cakes are very very good. The mushroom artichoke soup is amazing but they only serve it on certain days."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what else I could add to the tons of accurate positive reviews for 131 Main, I'm in love with this place. As long as I've been dining in Cornelius, NC, this restaurant is the most upscale place without going to Charlotte. The atmosphere is just beautiful and relax. The menu is quite diverse although it seems heavy on seafood dishes.   We started of with drinks. I had margaritas, like always. They were delicious you can't go wrong with it. The appetizers we had were salad and smoked salmon. They were unbelievable. My main course I had Maryland Style Crab Cakes, which came with grilled asparagus. My grandmom she is from Maryland and she said yes to them! My fiance had Braised Lamb Shank and he said it tasted a little different from other restaurants. It's got its own taste but still delicious. My grandpop had Shrimp and Grits. It was the best we've ever had.   The service was outstanding. Our waiter was entertaining and recommended some pretty good food and drinks.   A little on the pricey side, but overall: great food, great ambiance, great service in a great location! Can't get better than that!"}
{"text":"Excellent, unique and upscale dining in the Charlotte area.  I have been here for lunch and dinner.  They specialize in steaks, but I was pleasantly surprised by their more adventurous takes on traditional dishes.  I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting food this good in the Charlotte area.  So far I have tried the thai steak salad and the seared ahi tuna salad.  Both were very tasty with interesting dressings and fresh add ons like mango and avocado.  I've been told the ribs are excellent, but didn't personally have them.  Highly recommend.  Great atmosphere for a more formal meal or a date."}
{"text":"This has been my worst experience with the 131 Main brand. My food has little taste and was cold. The server was energetic and did an amazing job. When I made the reservations I noted it was my anniversary. The server attempted to bag our meals separately and we have on own matching wedding bands. The moment to celebrate was overlooked and not appropriately acknowledged."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, nice atmosphere and competent waiters. Food was good but not enough of it. No salad with dinner, vegetables very skimpy, prime rib was so thin and fatty it looked like sandwich meat.  Not what we expected for the price."}
{"text":"My new favorite place!   Me and my boyfriend came here for Valentine's Day on a whim AKA he forgot to put in for a reservation. Hostess staff was hospitable and friendly beforehand when we called to ask for a wait time. They were also welcoming upon arrival. They have a text messaging system when your table is ready which is pretty neat.  We showed up around 4:50ish and were ordering by 5:07 so we didn't have to wait long at all... Maybe a cancelled reservation or dumb luck.   For appetizer, we ordered the double dip- half pimento cheese and half guacamole. It was delicious to me. My boyfriend didn't care for the guacamole but to each their own.   For dinner the boyfriend got the prime rib with the loaded backed potato. I ordered the special catch, King Salmon with the loaded backed potato. My salmon was a beautiful portion and was worth it. It had this crab sauce on top that was to die for. My boyfriend is picky about his beef and stated that it was cooked to perfection. I cannot eat red meat due to Lent but his prime rib looked so good that I licked his fork. Yes, like a crazy person I licked his fork. Let's just say I know what to order next time we come.  For dessert, we went with the creme brûlée. Delicious and gone very quickly. It was on special for the holiday and I hope it becomes a feature.   Service was perfect, the food was amazing, and the price is worth the penny."}
{"text":"I've been to 131 Main in Ballantyne and was always impressed with the food and service. Unfortunately my experience in Cornelius was far from the standards in Ballantyne. I ordered filet mignon and it was the worst piece of meat I've ever encountered at an upscale restaurant. It tasted like the grill was cleaned with it as a brillo pad. Had to send it back because it was cold and raw in the middle and they still couldn't get it right. They weren't overly apologetic about it either. What a shame! I guess I'll wait for South Park to open to give them another try."}
{"text":"My gosh, their appetizer I think it's the double dip or whatever the chips, guac, and pimento cheese I have dreams about. So freaking good. And the wait staff and cook staff was nice enough to customize an entre for me with the eggs Benedict with biscuits and salmon, asparagus, and cheesy grits and it was honestly the greatest breakfast I've ever had in my life. Love it. Plus the wait staff is very nice, funny, and accommodating"}
{"text":"First time I've ever been here, and certainly won't be the last. The food was out of this world (my boyfriend and I had the cornbread as an appetizer, he had the ribs and I had the veggie burger), and the service was really the best part of our visit. Julia (she pronounced it Yulia) was our server and was fantastic; sweet, courteous, knowledgeable, prompt, and on top of anything we may have needed throughout the meal.  We did not have to ask for anything at all, and I couldn't sing hers and the other servers who topped off our drinks any higher.  Again, I will definitely be back, this has become a new spot to really show off Huntersville/Cornelius to friends and family."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Customer service was so poor. Manager wasn't friendly and they didn't try and accommodate us in any way. A little disappointing."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I am downgrading my review of the restaurant.  After reviewing their Queens Feast menu, I quickly made a reservation and upon arrival, was seated promptly.  We were given the standard menus.  I had to request a Queens Feast menu.  Later, I heard the waitress at the table next to us describe the contents of QF menu to the incoming customers.  Jealousy set in immediately.  My waitress was somewhat inattentive esp. since the restaurant had few customers between 3-4 on a Sunday afternoon.  We had to wait for her to return to our table a few times.  Back to our meal, I ordered:  - Drumheller Cabernet Sauvignon:  a nice blend that is easy on the palate.  Went very well with my meal. - Deviled eggs (our creamy homemade mixture garnished with parsley): \not as creamy as described.  My photo shows all. - Maryland-Style Crab Cakes (two jumbo lump crab cakes served with a whole grain mustard sauce with grilled asparagus): these were light and flavorful. - Brownie a la Mode: dessert was presented exactly as shown on the QF website.  It was delightful!.  I will return to 131 Main some months from now.  Hopefully, service will be much better than it was today."}
{"text":"The best dinning experience for the money in Cornelius!  Must try the Double Dip.  Call for reservations on weekends, this place is crowded."}
{"text":"I took my wife here for her birthday and we had a pretty great time. Good service and food led to an overall great experience that I definitely have to recommend for Lake Norman eats.  The interior is dark and a tad bit cramped, but luckily it was a warmer night and we were able to grab a table outside where it was a bit more spacious and intimate. There were a couple of servers who helped us which was a bit weird, and one was extremely friendly and knowledgeable while the other was not so much.   After grabbing beer and wine our Caesar salads came out ($5.00 as an add-on to an entree.) The salads were fresh and the dressing was definitely homemade. You can always tell with Caesar dressing when the dressing has the slight \"fishy\" taste to it. It was a pretty good salad.  For dinner I ordered the double cut pork chop ($23), which definitely lived up to the \"double\" part. This pork chop was huge! It had that fresh pork taste to it and I enjoyed it for the most part. My only complaint was that while I ordered it medium rare, it came out rare. I didn't complain since I was super hungry, but while it was tasty I couldn't get over that cool centered texture in my mouth. The chops came with mashed potatoes, and those bad boys were pretty bangin'!  My wife had the cast iron scallops ($25) and she enjoyed them. The scallops were cooked to perfection and were in a tasty sauce. The polenta and quinoa that accompanied it were also quite delicious.  For dessert we split a slice of key lime pie, and it's a good thing we split it because it was massive! It had a nice tartness to it and the crust was great. Overall it was a tastetacular dessert.  131 Main is definitely a great addition to the finer dining choices in the Lake Norman area. I'd definitely be down with returning for a round two."}
{"text":"Great dinner for my husband and me in a nice little booth made for two! Their new drinks are excellent, so is the service. We had Xane. Fabulous!! Definitely recommend the wolf fish! Will be back many times."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant. It is always a treat to come here, the food is both fresh and delicious. I've never had a bad meal here. My favorite is the tilapia and grits but that is not regularly on the menu. I definitely recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"We came for our anniversary dinner on 12/17/16 and it was our first time here. Thankfully, we made a reservation and we still had to wait just a little before we were seated.   Firstly, the service here is so quick! Someone took our drink order, and 10 seconds later, we had our waters ready to go. It seems as though 131 is a well-oiled machine. Their servers would come and go to each table, refilling drinks, checking on you, making sure you don't need anything.  Our main server was Michael (who looks like Joey from \"Friends\"). He was so sweet and did a great job!  We ordered the artichokes, which I thought would have been a little better as far as size and flavor. They tasted fine, but since they don't add any stuffing or anything to them, they leave you wanting more.  I ordered a chicken salad, which was absolutely delicious. It had fresh avocados, berries, cheese, and it all blended together very well in a huge portion!  The fiancé ordered the ribs with fries - the meat just falls right off the bone! So delicious and the fries were cooked perfectly crispy.  I think this place is definitely at least a 4 star restaurant - maybe we'll try a different appetizer next time.   One recommendation I'd give is to 100% make a reservation if you're going on the weekend. We'll see you there!"}
{"text":"I ate here with a colleague on a recent trip to NC. I was recommended to go to this place and really enjoyed my self. I had the Ribs which I thought were good but not great. The Cornbread is fantastic."}
{"text":"This is one of my favs in Charlotte area.  Food and service are consistently pleasing.  Cornbread is scrumptious.  Ahi tuna salad is a winning combo with fresh avocado and homemade dressing, yum yum!  The only reason I didn't give this local dive five stars is because the prices are slightly inflated."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places!!  Excellent food- it is always cooked perfectly! My husband's favorite is the ribs, I love the cedar plank salmon. Their fries are the best! But I must say, anything you order you will love The service is top notch too! Their atmosphere is also very relaxing. This is always my first pick to go when eating out in the huntersville-Cornelius area (and Charlotte area too!)"}
{"text":"Food is great, service is great. Never had a bad experience here. The cornbread is good to start with and I've had the soy ribeye with mashed potatoes and also the Cajun chicken pasta. They were both good. The ribeye can be a little fatty. Pretty expensive dinner but a nice experience."}
{"text":"We sat on the patio where they allowed me to bring my dog which was a plus for this restaurant! Our waiter was very friendly and offered suggestions. The food was delicious with a good presentation. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this establishment because it's hidden in a shopping center which is sometimes questionable. The decor was really nice and we sat near the fire pit which almost made me forget that we overlooked a busy road."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for lunch. All ingredients are fresh and homemade. Portions are large and tasty. I gave them 4 stars as their prices are high but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Still love the place and we are so happy you opened in LKN first. Still an easy 5 stars. But...  Things we miss...  1. The shrimp cocktail. So simple yet so frigging hard to get decent shrimp, no matter how they are prepared, around here. 2. The smoked salmon appetizer. Only been gone two days since the new menu came out but we miss it already.  Other than that, keep doing what you do cause the pickins' up here at the lake is slim."}
