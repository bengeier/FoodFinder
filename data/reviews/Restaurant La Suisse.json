{"text":"A romantic escape to Europe just a few miles over the US border!! The hosts are super friendly and the dining is reminiscent of a quaint Swiss fondue restaurant. We have stayed at the Inn and eaten here at least eight times over the years and are going back again in a few weeks. We always order the fondue which is made fresh by real Swiss Germans who know what they're doing.  Stay here if you are driving to Montreal  from New England. The rate is $95 plus you get a 10% discount with AAA. Have a great dinner, drink a bottle of wine, stumble up to your room, wake up to a wonderful European style breakfast, hike the paths through their acreage, and then take off for Montreal which is about an hour's drive.   I have to mention that the rooms are no frills but have TVs unlike many B&Bs. You are right on Rt 133 so you must be prepared to hear the trucks go by on the highway. They are all on the second floor which means you might have accessibility issues.  My rating of 5 stars is for the complete package (dinner, room, breakfast). You might forget your stay at the Frontenac or the Ritz, but you'll never forget the romantic little nook you found in Pike River."}
{"text":"What an absolute delight! We are traveling back to Vermont in a blizzard and needed to stop. I am a big fan of fondue so this was perfect. The inside was charming and the fondue was delicious. Our host and server Roger was very charming and attentive. We started with the cheese fondue, then the beef and then chocolate fondue. Incredibly decadent. No need to rush as we sat for 2 hours enjoying our meal. Worth the stop on your way to Montreal or to Vermont. Be prepared to spend some cash though. Fondue is never cheap but this is worth it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place. Driving on dark roads to Montreal we stumbled across La Suisse for the night. Inside is very typical of a Swiss-style chalet, with a log cabin-esque exterior. In the lobby is an assortment of fondues, chocolates and jams. On each door is a name of a different Swiss city (Bern, Zurich, Geneve, etc.) and the rooms are immaculate. The beds are super comfortable on wooden frames, and there were no signs of bedbugs whatsover, even under the mattresses. Set in a very rural, remote Quebec town, but the view of the cornfields in the morning is incredible! There is a full continental breakfast in the morning starting at 8am I believe. Excellent place to stay if traveling from Vermont to Montreal.  Tip: use AAA card for a 10% discount."}
{"text":"Talk about an unusual find. A Swiss-German restaurant in a remote town in Quebec! This family-owned restaurant serves primarily fondue (all types) . They even serve raclette in the traditional Swiss style. The service is great and the food is even more fantastic! Fresh ingredients, well-seasoned fondue, and homemade sauces. What else can one want? I love their paprika and garlic sauces for the meat fondues. They sell them in small and big jars so I make sure that I get some each time I stop by.   I am unsure why they have all these very old posters of different Swiss cities on their walls. They should really replace them or at least frame them. But that's just a bitc*y comment since everything else about this restaurant is great.   There is also a bed and breakfast attached to the hotel (4 rooms) so if you find yourself driving between Burlington, VT and Montreal, QC, do stop by this restaurant. You won't be disappointed."}
