{"text":"Good lunch place if working in the area. Good variety; sandwiches made to order, grill, pizza, salad bar, soups, etc. Chicken salad sandwich on croissant is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Food order - almost always wrong. Availability of menu items - poor.   Price - always on the rise Customer Service - AAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAA  When I stand there for 20 minutes before the jerk at the grill says he can't make my chicken sandwich because he doesn't have any chicken and I ask to talk to someone about it and that mystery person can't be found...ahahahahahaa No discount, no discussion, not even an \"I'm sorry!\"  Or should we bring up the large amount of employees who don't understand English?  They never respond to posts on their facebook page, there are no contact email addresses...just...radio silence.  Save your $, save your temper, save your gas, save your lunch time...Go to any of the other food joints in the area!"}
{"text":"Salad bar is really good but terribly overpriced......food is fresh, place is very clean but please lower you salad bar price...the only protien that you have is shredded chicken so can't see why the salad bar is so expensive."}
{"text":"Sorry to go against so many people, but their green chili burger is on point. It's all I ever get."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since the day it opened as I work in one of the buildings in the plaza it is in.  In the beginning, although the prices were a bit high, I was impressed by the quality of the food, but that quickly changed.     I have been both a patron and ordered catering through them and can say that I have not been happy.  On one occassion they forgot my catering order for an office event.  They made a poor attempt to pull it together in the end, but this was a whole office event and ended up looking like quite the fool. Their reprieve was to offer me free deliver on my next order!  Wow!  On other occassions they were late, the orders were cold or incorrect and I had no choice but to not use them anymore as I was getting too many complaints.    I can just say that THANK GOD they have partnered with Nibblers for their corpoarate catering division as they alone were an epic fail.  As long as David and Diane are part of Nibblers I beleive the quality of the food and good service will be good.    As for just stopping in for a quick bite, first you would think their salad bar was gold plated.  It is a nice one, don't get me wrong, but I can go down to Sweet Tomatoes and get a better deal with more choices.  Also,heir grill has made so many mistakes I am afraid to go back as I always have to triple check my order.    They are also understaffed.  I was in there this morning just wanting to get a quick breakfast and there was no one at the cash register.  Someone from the coffee bar said I could come over there to pay and I truly felt bad for the guy.  There were four people in line and he was making a coffee for one of them as she gave him directions for doing so.   He was doing his best and had a great attitude, but should have never been put in that position.  It definately wasn't his fault, but seeing that it could take a while more to pay for my one item, I tossed it in the garbage and left hungry as I was late for work with the time I already had to wait to  pay.  Where was the manager who is usually sitting at the counter playing on his computer?????"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Did not even try it. I went in and pointed to a strange looking hotdog while asking the employee what it was. He bluntly replied with a horrible attitude that it was just a hotdog. Asked him what it had on it and pointed at the sign instead of describing it to me face to face as if he was begging to be replaced with a vending machine. If I wanted to read I would read it or gone to an automated restaurant."}
{"text":"Folks who work downtown, rejoice - there's a new option for a quick, delicious lunch that won't you leave you broke or gross-feeling.  For those who care, Mid City Kitchen was started in November by chef Michael DeMaria, whose other restaurants - like Heirloom - are out of my price range.  I was excited to eat at a lunch counter restaurant with lunch counter prices where the food was cooked up in the imagination of someone who normally catered to a different crowd.  Yes, this is a lunch counter.  There is a pizza station, a sandwich (hot or cold) station, and a fry station, plus soups and a salad bar.  The salad bar had a wide range of choices - not your usual sad mushrooms and old lettuce.  I can only vouch for the pizza and the french fries - both expertly executed and delicious.  Everything else looked really tasty, though.  Word of advice - don't go for the half pizza, unless you plan on getting a side.  The pizzas are definitely personal-sized, so half a pizza will leave you hungry.  Also, the place is tucked away in an office complex, in the smallest building, attached to the parking garage.  Parking is all on-the-street metered or in the garage, so it's really more of a place that's handy if you work in the area than one that's worth driving across town for."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something filling, inexpensive, made-to-order and comforting for LUNCH, this is the place. You want Pizza? You Got It. You want Pasta? You Got It. You want Soup and/or Salad? You Got It! I'm glad I work nearby and have this as a lunch option! (Parking could be a bit difficult for those who don't work in the vacinity, but well worth the parallel parking efforts!  A co-worker and I went and both got the specials of the days today: He, the Hatch Green Chile Meatloaf with Green Onion Mashed Potatoes, and I, the Rigatoni with Short Rib and Cremini Mushrooms! Both of us agreed BOTH dishes were DELISH! And... I got leftovers to boot! For $6.99, that's a steal!  Next time I go, I won't do my usual free water as a drink... they've got interesting drink concoctions such as spa water... a mixture of pineapple and cantaloupe juice that have me wanting to try them!  For the first-timer, the space will have you doing a 360--literally turning around and going \"How does this place work?\" and \"There's so much to choose from!\" But once you figure it out, you won't mind and will be quite happy to go through the Mid-City aisles again and again, I'm sure!  Only complaint is that all orders whether in or out are in disposible to go boxes... wish the dine in orders could be less wasteful... but it is convenient for a leftover person like myself... oh how I wish I could have them plop the meal into my own tupperware for less waste, but probably not appropriate with health codes."}
{"text":"We just recently discovered Mid City Kitchen, and I really wish we would have known about it sooner! They have great variety, so everyone in my lunch group can find something to eat. This is one of the places that everyone has agreed they would go back to - which is rare for the area!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and extremely inflated (can you say gouge) pricing. Yes, the airport is a captive audience but Mid City Kitchen exploits this with major greed."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a burger and not only was it great, but the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They were great to talk to and make some good food. The manager was also very friendly. Will definitely stop in the next time I'm here!"}
{"text":"PERMANENTLY CLOSED, per their FB post: https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=906999155991710&id=160896087268691  I ate here a lot over the last few years since my office moved to this general location. Never had too much of a problem with it, although sometimes they took forever to make burgers and they never handled busy periods too well.   Anyway - woo hoo, this is my 100th review.  Edit: for those wondering, apparently the reason they shut down was because of the rent for the space. I also heard that there will be a new food place opening here, but no idea what style it would be. If Fired Pie moves here from across the road, though, I'd be one happy, HAPPY camper."}
{"text":"very convenient place for me to go and eat lunch probably one of my favorite things there is the chili especially this time of the year. i've tried a little bit of everything and the only i didn't care for at all was the pizza."}
{"text":"One of the worst blt sandwiches I've had in my life. And that cost me $10!   The person behind the counter was super rude. It wasn't clear that the full menu wasn't available in the morning and made that clear pretty rudely. When I asked what was available, he stared me down as if that was a stupid question. The lady in queue behind told me that the screen was going through the menus one by one and that that breakfast menu would show up soon."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by defending against some of the reviews of my fellow Yelpers. If you are looking for a bargain, this isn't the place for you. If you are looking for a speedy turnaround, again, not the place for you. This joint cooks real hamburgers from scratch. Good luck finding something this fresh throughout any airport. I eat here any chance I get. When you order your burger you are told that it will take about 10 minutes to cook. Again, nothing is pre-cooked. That hamburger patty he is putting on the grill is the real deal. A full meal including fries and a drink will average you $15 and it's worth every cent. Yes, it's greasy and heavy, but it's a \"real\" burger. I feel I'm a very manly dude and can appreciate those characteristics in my hamburger. Seating kinda sucks, but perhaps it's so passers by can gawk at that look of pure satisfaction on my face as I lick my fingers clean. Delish.  If you don't like costly slow burgers, there a McDonald's around the corner with factory burgers."}
{"text":"I'm thrilled to find this hidden gem for lunch in midtown Phoenix.  This place is along the light rail Thomas/Central station stop. There is a nice salad bar, pizza station, sandwich station, pasta station, soups, and some pre-made items. Everything is really fresh and made to order.  I enjoyed the personal sized thin crust pizza and chicken noodle soup. My hubby loves the rotisserie chicken which he says has good flavor and moist. Best part is half a chicken is only 3.50.  I can walk here from work, so I love having so many options in one place. So if you're in the area and in need of a quick tasty lunch, drop in and give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is overpriced for what they have to offer, the customer service leave a lot to be desired. Laura seems to be the only one that cares about the customers. The manager is absolutely horrible, nothing but trouble from him. He's rude, yells, and when a coworker found a PUSH PIN in her chili he had the nerve to accuse her of putting it in herself.  If you have no choice but to eat around there, bring your lunch from home."}
{"text":"Overpriced cold sandwich for $10. WTF. Please don't order anything from the grill, too."}
{"text":"Service is just nasty! Very angry unhappy people behind the counter! Go to Matts Big Breakfast instead!"}
{"text":"Tuesday, 1:30PM.  Cutting close to a flight. Craving sweets.  Quickie:  +Good customer service +Clean  And then...? Baked goods are made in-house.   ********** Stuffed my face in: 1. Chocolate chip cookie      +Chewy, 'fudgy'   Constructive comments: *De-clutter spacing *Compost and recycling bins *List ingredients to products (especially the homemade ones)"}
{"text":"Terrible greasy burger, almost burnt fries, and slow cashier who let her airport employee friend cut the line.  I watched the grill guy put raw hamburger and raw chicken on the grill and then turn around with the same hand and finish making a sandwich, touching all the toppings and bun.  My meal ended up in the trash.  Skip this one."}
{"text":"i would probably like this place more if I didn't have lunch here every three days.   The staff is awesome. I love the way you walk in and every body knows your name. And they're always glad you came. Ha! Yes, just like Cheers. Only without beer. Beer would really make this place. Yeah.... Pizza and beer or burgers and beer for lunch. Yes! I'm in.   My favourites are the chili, turkey burger, and chips and guacamole. They have a salad bar but I think its overpriced so I don't eat that. Oh they have a half rotisserie chicken thats pretty good. A different flavor every day and at a decent price."}
{"text":"Gross.  Most items I've had remind me of bad cafeteria food. Fine if you're desperate, I guess. It's still food."}
