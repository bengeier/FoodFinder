{"text":"Je n'étais pas venu à ce restaurant depuis près de 20 ans. Le service et la nourriture sont toujours excellents. Une cuisine asiatique fine et une carte des vins et alcools à prix vraiment raisonnable. Je n'attendrai pas un autre 20 ans pour y revenir!"}
{"text":"Of all Old Montreal Restaurants in that area, that one is my least favourite"}
{"text":"A mixed bag. Some of the dishes were outstanding, some average and a few inedible. The service can best be described as creepy."}
{"text":"Very solid Chinese restaurant in the heart of Old Montreal at the intersection of Rue Notre Dame and Sainte Helene--a block or two away from the Hotel Gault where I recently stayed.

Very good lunch specials during the week. Probably the best General Tso Chicken I have had anywhere with high quality chicken breast, fried rice, corn soup with crabmeat, and a spring roll as part of the lunch special. The sauce on my my chicken was rich and delicious--high quality Chinese food, not fast food--and a little bit, but not too, spicy. I would like to come back and try their Shrimp and Scallops in Garlic Sauce. Definitely worth a shot--surprised by the earlier review."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favourite spots for Szechuan food. Prices are a little toward the high side, but the food and impeccable service are totally worth it."}
{"text":"We were very lucky to find this restaurant while walking by our hotel.  The food was good and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"We were wandering around Old Montreal and happened across this small restaurant and we were glad we stopped. 

The staff were fabulous. They timed the meal very well, kept the water glasses full, multilingual, and not at all intrusive. 

We started with some appetizers and shared a main. The waiter brought us clean plates for each part of the meal; the dinner plates were even warmed. We had the dumplings and bon bon chicken to start. Both were good, but the sauce on the bon bon chicken was super delicious. If they sold bottles of it, I would have taken it home with me. For a main, we chose the sizzling beef. It was actually sizzling! The waiter finished off the dish table side and it just smelled amazing. It tasted equally good. I enjoyed that the vegetables were more than just the standard fare and included a variety of mushroom types. 

I really liked that at the end of the meal we got the standard fortune cookies and as well as almond cookies (they're my fav!)."}
{"text":"Accidentally stumbled upon this restaurant.  What a gem! Best Asian food my husband and I ever had! I had the pepper  chicken with crispy spinach special and my husband had the braised duck. Both meals wer absolutely phenomenal. Great ambiance, nice, quiet dinner after a long day of sight seeing. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough.  You will not be sorry. Attentive and friendly service.."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a nice Chinese restaurant in Old Montreal you've found the right spot.  Last fall I came with a Chinese family from Australia and had a solid banquet dinner.  Last week I had a solo dinner.  To my surprise they had a dinner menu for one.  I started with a cup of hot and sour soup followed by shredded Hunan pork served with sauteed vegetables served with steamed rice.  For dessert a fruit cup and made in Canada fortune and almond cookies...."}
{"text":"Visiting from the States. We were on our way to another restaurant when it started raining and we stumbled into this place.  Really glad we did. This place has great NON GRESY food, and the service, oh the service, so good. I encourage anyone to try this place. 

Also important, we have a 1 year old.  These guys were very accommodating and the atmosphere of the restaurant was very pleasant."}
