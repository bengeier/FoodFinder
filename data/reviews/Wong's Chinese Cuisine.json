{"text":"Water:
It might sound silly but water is very important to me - if a restaurant can't serve good water how can anything taste good?!

The water was good!

Off to a bad start:

BBQ Pork Slices Appetizer
BBQ Rib Appetizer
And
Sizzling Rice Soup

All very bland with very little flavor...

Egg Rolls - Excellent!

Crab Puffs are good too...

I didn't try any but my family said the egg foo young was very good!

Orange Beef was good as well - a tad too sweet for me - but I would eat it again.

My family also really liked Moo Shu Beef

I really liked the Orange Chicken!

The Crispy Beef Pan Fried Noodles were good but really needed to be crunchier.

The Lemon Chicken is AMAZING!!

 Prices are ok the place is clean...

We would come back....

Overall review is a decent place nothing special but you won't be unhappy you came... If you have a few of the better dishes - it just might make you smile :)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed meal tonight. This place is overpriced and EVERYTHING is A la Cart. How is a side of vegetables $6.25?! And I have never been to a Chinese restaurant with absolutely no combinations. I mean really?! To top it off the sesame chicken was dry and the sauce was not mixed well and I could see the guminess from the thickener ugh. No need to waste your time or hard earned mo"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Nice owners and didn't even before for.a yelp review. Go here."}
{"text":"Great food, even better service! The house chicken is pretty good, as is the Mongolian beef and emperor's chicken. Mei was super kind and even helped us score free eggrolls. I will return!"}
{"text":"First time eating at Wong's and this is honestly the best Chinese cuisine restaurant I've ever been to. The entire staff was welcoming and super nice. The food is just amazing. Would recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"My favorite. Probably eat her a little to much. Love this place. There isn't a bad thing I could possible say about this place. Go and eat you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I was craving a hot & sour soup and I'm glad I went there to have it. We ordered orange chicken & lomein and it was seriously amazing. The food has a lot of flavor to it. The staff was very friendly! I can't wait to get home to eat the left overs. 

Salt & pepper shrimp I am coming for you next visit!"}
{"text":"I love Wong's.  My wife and I wanted to try something new and we felt like Chinese food so I looked at some reviews and we decided to give this place a try.  When pulling up to it we were a little skeptical because it is located in an older strip mall, and we both are picky when it comes to Chinese food.  We went in anyway and we are glad we did.  We have gone back a couple of time a month since.  We always get soup (I get the Hot and Sour and my wife gets the Wonton) and Crab Cheese Puffs(absolutely awesome tasting.  For the main meal we usually share the Sesame Chicken(portion sizes a big enough to share and we still take some home.  If my brother goes with us we get the Orange Beef too and that is really good.  I would get that more often but my wife does not like any spice in her food.  The restaurant its self is never very busy which is too bad because it makes our top 3 Chinese Restaurants that we have gone too.  The service is always pretty good and the part that makes me laugh when ever we go there is the lady who fills up the water is constantly filling our glasses no matter how much drink is left. :)  Way to go Wong's I just wish more people would give you a try."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 2007. I always recommend this place to family and friends.  Very nice and polite. All servers will attend you. Not just one. The food, MAN! THE FOOD IS GREAT!"}
{"text":"I don't think I will ever try another Chinese food place as long as I live in Arizona everything was delicious"}
{"text":"Our family has made wongs chinese restaurant one of our favorite places to eat, because it is so special.The staff are helpful and always remember us and almost remember each of the meals we like.It is really clean with table cloths and you never wait for the food to come.Real chinese quisine - egg drop soup, crab puffs etc and tea.A nice experience ,thank you the Hickeys."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast service. Excellent food. Loved the War Wonton soup. It was a meal in itself. Wong's House Chicken was delicious with just the right amount of spice. Egg Fu Young was light, fluffy, and very tasty."}
{"text":"Over the years, I've wanted to like lemon chicken, but have always found it disappointingly syrupy and bland. That is, until Wong's. The best lemon chicken OF MY LIFE! Each crispy bite was had the perfect balance of sweet and tart, and tasted like... wait for it... ACTUAL fresh-squeezed lemon!

As with anything meant to be crispy, eating it fresh was definitely best. I'd say the lemon chicken was a 6/7 when I got it home and a PERFECT 10 at the restaurant. 

Everything else was either as good as I've ever had, or better. The cream-cheese wontons...Hot and sour soup... Mongolian beef... Chicken chow mein... ALL fantastic.

After eating at Wong's for the first time, I told my brother and his wife how amazing I thought their food was. He said (nonchalantly) \"oh yeah, we've been coming here for years\" and I just about blew a gasket he didn't tell me about it sooner. 

:-) Enjoy."}
{"text":"We were visiting from L.A and in the mood for good Chinese food.
We found this place on yelp and found it to be near by. 
The server was very helpful and friendly but most of all the food was done right and it was deliciously good.
Our order was for 4 adults and it was alot of food, plenty for later.
We had
kung pow chicken.......very good
Emperor chicken.........very good
Orange  chicken ..........good 
Beef and snow pea. ...very good
Sweet and sour pork...good
Egg drop soup............very good
Steam rice..................very good
Fried rice ....................very good
Vegetable chow mein...so/so/bit bland 
Egg rolls........................so/so./ too greasy

From outside it may look dull, but once you enter it's nice and inviting. 
All in all, we enjoyed the food and we will be back next time in town."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! The food is always great (I'm always trying new things and am never disappointed, but I revisit the chicken and eggplant dish frequently). Portions are huge and the prices are great (tonight we ordered 2 soups, 2 entrees, and got a side of rice all for $21- and had 3 boxes of food to take home). Great service, great little whole in the wall restaurant."}
{"text":"Wong's has been rated Best Chinese in Phoenix for several years. I love it, I haven't had a single thing on the menu that I haven't liked.  I usually get the orange chicken, very light breading and the orange sauce is amazing, I get it double hot. The owners wife doesn't seem to like her job or maybe she is just socially awkward because she doesn't come off as a people person. Her husband however is super nice, and I've never had a problem with the wait staff, they have always been accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"Great and delicious food! My party ordered crab puffs, honey walnut shrimp and the emperors chicken. Every single item select was FANTASTIC! The wait staff were very friendly, knowledgeable and efficient! I would recommend to all my family and friends!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The orange chicken is one of the best tasting and their service has always been great."}
{"text":"No Way.  Was excited to see the ratings here on Yelp!  but really guys.... NO WAY.  I am from Atlanta Georgia, so i guess my views are skewed. First impression is GREAT inside the building.  Nice and clean, staff in tuxedos.... water never goes empty, and they provide hot tea at lunch.  Prices were great, selections the same.  Didn't offer Hot and Sour soup at lunch, only egg drop.  I ordered the Sesame Chicken based on the recommendations here.  OK..... here we go.... Big plate, complete with BIG egg roll, 2 cream cheese fried pastries, lots of rice and huge serving of chicken in sauce.  Egg roll was inedible.  Laden with some spice like cinnamon, but don't think it was cinnamon...  I took one bite and couldn't eat anymore.  The rice was normal.  Chicken was best described as canned chicken.  It was tough and not normal.  I would have to say this is the first time i left 1/5 of an egg roll, 1/2 rice and 1/2 entree.  Waitress asked if i would like to box it up and i politely declined.  I will not be back and scratching Wong's off the list to try."}
{"text":"We recently went for lunch a week ago and the food and service was fabulous. That today I went with my hubby and he was really impressed with the food. Bravo to the cook and staff. Much needed improvement. I was told by the waitress her father in law was the cook and they took over the restaurant 10 months ago. I will be back and refer this place now.  Keep up the great service and quality of food."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this restaurant in over a year. Wife told me the ownership had changed so we tried it again for takeout. Awesome lemon chicken, this is my new fix when I crave Chinese food."}
{"text":"First time at Wong's definitely won't be our last 
we gave 5 stars because we had substitutions and special requests ( no shell fish and make everything except the orange chicken super spicy ...even dishes not normally served that way ) everything was great . The place was clean  . The food was fresh . Service was great  
Yeah we will be back"}
{"text":"The staff.. Super friendly... The food was delicious!!  Went this past weekend to grab take out... First time trying them... Definitely will not be my last!!  I'm thinking of their beef fried rice and shrimp egg foo young for dinner tonight!!"}
{"text":"I'm very dissapointed. They must have changed cooks. I have been here 3 times. I thought that the food was excellent. Last night every thing we ordered was too salty.The garlic chicken,  was not prepared right.The manager did not remedy our compaints properly. I will not come back."}
{"text":"This place awesome. The service is awesome and I love the customer se4vice. Would deffinatwly recommend to otheres. Must go"}
{"text":"Not quite Lim's (75th and Thomas) that I grew up eating at, but the best place we've found in years. Nice staff, great food!"}
{"text":"This was our second time to eat here since the new owners took over.  The food was excellent - Wor Wonton Soup with Noodles and Singapore Rice Noodles.  The servers were very friendly and efficient.  We will definitely make this our go-to Chinese restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Clean, large menu, simple decor, great service & price.  Exterior appearances  are misleading.  We had a party of 6, shared 4 evening entrees, & had plenty for lunch for all the next day.  Will be back when in town."}
{"text":"This place used to be good. Food tasted old, got sick. Don't be fooled by the 4 stars, this is not a good restaurant. Like I stated before used to come in all the time but my last experience for dinner made me ill. Zero stars"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing and very helpful server. Just an overall great experience. We really wanted Chinese cuisine and we arrived about 15min before close. They didn't make any uncomfortable faces or made us feel unwelcome. I would totally recommend this place, and will arrive way earlier next time to really look over the menu and have time to enjoy my food just a bit more! This will easily be my favorite place now!"}
{"text":"We went on Christmas and they were packed. The staff worked hard to keep customers happy. All of the staff were friendly and the food was delicious!  They have a great selection of entrees. We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Wong's is my daughters requested birthday dinner restaurant every year. Our family of four has been going here for 4 years and we love it.  The food is so good, we won't even think about going anywhere else.  It's a nice little restaurant and the service is friendly.  The food is flavorful and cooked to perfection literally,every time.  The veggies (my favorite) are fresh and cooked al dente, just the way I like them, never soggy.  We've tried a LOT of items on the menu and are never disappointed. (We think they have the best lo mein and eggrolls around!) Some of our favorites are Mongolian beef, Sesame chicken, Hometown tofu, Veggie lo mein, Kung pao two, Cashew chicken, Shrimp w/ veg, Szechwan chicken, West lake shrimp w/veg, fried crab puffs and Orange chicken.  We love our Wong's!  They take a lot pride in serving delicious, fresh Chinese food, we always leave there satisfied.  They've got us hooked!"}
{"text":"I have been to Wong's several times now since I moved to Phoenix just a little over a year ago. Every time I have been to Wong's I have had a great meal. I have tried several meals there including the Sesame Chicken, the Wong's Special Lo Mein, and the Barbecue Pork Lo Mein. All of them have been well prepared with no issues. I also get the entree add on which consists of an egg roll, 2 crab puffs and your choice of won ton soup or egg drop soup for a small added fee as it is worth it,. The portions at this restaurant are large. They have a great atmosphere and the employees at this restaurant are top notch, friendly and respectful. If you're in Phoenix and you want great Chinese food make a stop at Wong's and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"While prices are far from unreasonable, I'm not so sure this place is worth the even reasonable prices.  As people wrote in other reviews, the egg rolls are clearly the star of this restaurant.  Oily?  Yes.  But, ohhhh so tasty.  It would've been nice if they had brought noodles to go with the duck sauce and Chinese hot mustard they brought to the table, but ... okay.  I'm fat enough.  Never mind.

As for the main dishes, we had the Kung Pao Chicken and Pepper Beef.  Interestingly enough, they told us, when they arrived with the food, that the food was being served with fried rice.  Well, first, bringing fried rice without asking if he wanted it was \"interesting\" enough; but what they brought seemed an awful lot like brown rice (which you should DEFINITELY ask people if they want, because lots of people don't like it).  I had no complaints:  brown rice is certainly healthier than white rice and vastly more so than fried rice.  But, if this was fried rice, it was indeed strange, for it wasn't greasy and there was nothing in it except rice (which is unusual for \"fried rice\").

Okay, faux pas aside, I had no problem with the rice.  But the Kung Pao was the standard shreds of \"maybe\"-chicken with small bamboo squares; celery and bland some-kinda-sauce.  The pepper beef I found completely bizarre:  the meat was almost smooth.  Seriously:  when's the last time you had beef that was \"smooth\".  If I didn't know, I'd guess it was pieces of soy imitating beef (and the taste was \"strange\" as well ... no \"beef\" I've ever known).

Service was prompt and efficient.  Bathroom, while nothing to take a picture of and submit to Better Homes and Gardens, clean and smelling nice.  Bill?  Okay.  Two people - $36 with tip (though it would've been more had we not had the family dinner).

Would I come back here?  If I had a craving for egg rolls, I might.  Otherwise?  Meh.  Nothing bad; but nothing exciting either.  Sort of like Wife Number 2 after Number 1 dumped you and you figured, it's her or no one to cook your meals when you get old (incredibly sexist, I know, but ohhhh so how men think).

If you HAVE to, come.  But don't risk the car running out of gas to come here.  If you are young and stupid enough, Panda Express will do just fine (hey!  Someone's gotta keep doctors and hospitals in business!).

Meh"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I have to say it is one of the best Chinese food restaurants around town. Their Singapore rice noodles are ah-mazing!the kids loved their chicken lo-mein. happy family is a mother great dish. I will definitely come back for that and the Singapore noodles. The hubby had pad Thai with shrimps and chicken it had the perfect spice level. All dishes were tasty.  Friendly staff and they are always on top of refills."}
{"text":"Been here for years but they can never get it right. Ask for fried rice with your meal they give you chicken fried rice. Its all thrown in in a hurry. The girl at the front desk doesnt speak english sooo how do expect  to get it right.  Dont get me wrong the food is good but they just cant give you what you ordered."}
{"text":"This simple, family owned restaurant is a place where you are treated like family.  The food is excellent and plentiful.  The staff is friendly and give wonderful service.  We have recommended this great find to everyone.  We hope you will treat yourselves to their scrumptious food served in a cheerful, relaxing setting."}
{"text":"Always great food,service, and prices!! A long drive, but worth it everytime. :-) We make a special trip once a month to enjoy Wong's! Orange chicken and sesame beef!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go. The staff is nice and they take pride in their cooking. If you like China Chili off 3rd Street you will like this place because they are owned by the same family. The portions are huge, the egg rolls are fresh and crispy even when you go carry out.  You have to try Wong's!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 16 and all the dishes we ordered were very good, service was very good.
Drinks are very inexpensive.
Can't for our next visit"}
{"text":"In the West valley Wong's is my go to, must have at least every month, Chinese restaurant.  The unsuspecting location just east of 107th Ave on Indian School Rd in the Villa De Paz Plaza is an unlikely but very welcome home to the best Chinese food to ever pass my lips.  I have yet to have a bite of food that I would be unwilling to order again and I've nearly eaten through the menu.  Tables are set with white linen table clothes and neatly folded linen napkins, in my opinion, as a statement of fine dining which is what Wong's is cooking up in this humble family restaurant.  If you have the opportunity, request Mei as your server, she has been a staple for nearly 20yrs and is the cornerstone of the staff."}
{"text":"Good food. But Not my favorite place to eat. We were once warned by an employee to not eat our leftovers after the next day. That was concerning."}
{"text":"I always go to Wongs because their $6.75-$7.75 lunch specials can't be beat! I recommend the sweet and sour chicken, chicken lo mein, and the chicken teriyaki. Ask for Mei because she's the best waitress there!"}
{"text":"Tried Wong's on Friday Just before close and the food and service was excellent.  Had Sweet & Sour Chicken entree with egg roll and wonton soup.  It was excellent!  I grew up in NY and this was absolutely wonderful.  Chicken was great size portion. Egg roll was crispy, soup was fresh.  Friends had fried rice and Cantonese Dinner for two.  We ran over close time and they did not rush us out whatsoever.  Will for sure try again."}
{"text":"First time here for to go order place was clean staff were very nice menu was great lots of things some places don't have,
Again it was to go food was well pack in a box got it home and it was hot and delicious portions were large and yummy this may be my go to for Chinese"}
{"text":"Finding a really good, homey Chinese restaurant is really important to me and my husband. Call us crazy, but we love Chinese food, and there's something special about a family-style restaurant that can't be replaced with all the PF Changs and Pei Weis and Panda Expresses of the world. 

When a friend told me her family has been going to Wong's for years and years, I knew I had to try it. 

When we walked in, the decor reminded me of my family's local Chinese restaurant that we loved. After we were seated, our waitress brought us hot tea and ice water. My husband and I have a ritual: he gets whatever is most like his favorite dish (General Chu's Chicken) and I get something different. Then, he has to have noodles. 

He found the Emperor's Chicken, which was very good. The big chunks of white meat chicken were fried, but not thickly battered. The sauce was spicy with a hint of sweetness. Our other dish was the Mongolian Beef. It was very good, but not as good as my favorite Mongolian sauce - at the Mandarin Grill in Tucson. The lo mein noodles were good, but my husband wanted the BBQ pork, and that's not really something I like. 

My water glass was never even half empty before our waitress came to refill it, and the tea was very good. 

I am so happy to have found a good Chinese restaurant in the West Valley, not too far from home."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food,  great service and friendly staff. Dine in is classy and sophisticated.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Chinese Food is an NYC staple and I have to say I have been searching for a halfway decent  Chinese restaurant for more than two decades. We stumbled upon this place a few months ago and I am sooo glad that we did. Trust me, the food is the closest you are going to get to NYC Chinese in the valley.  As an added bonus, the hosts and hostesses we have encountered have always been extremely welcoming and hospitable. I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I only order one dish when I come here, and it alone is worth 5 stars. Get the Velvet Shrimp; I get the sauce on the side. It's the only place in Arizona that we have found that service scrambled eggs with shrimp like we can get back home in California. It's Delicious! I have tried other sides in the past and didn't like them, and haven't tried since they updated the menu, but I am willing to give it another chance in the future. The service is great."}
{"text":"I took a chance based on Yelp! Reviews, and I was not disappointed. We enjoyed the vegetable lo mein, shrimp w/vegetables, and Wong's fried rice. Everything was fresh and had tons of great flavors. My picky 5-yr old had four servings. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love Asian food. I've had most of the menu here. The crab puffs are amazing and I can only eat the egg rolls and be completely satisfied. The waitresses are friendly, they really care about your experience. Oolong tea is a delicious must! Side note, the bathrooms are super clean."}
{"text":"A+++ Service. I cannot say enough about the service that we received here. I went for a birthday dinner with a party of 9 with two kids. We were seated promptly, drinks were fast, appetizers were faster, and the staff was very attentive with practically every employee in the restaurant coming to check on us, even on a busy night. These people know how to do Chinese food. Truly a exceptional Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Just left wong's and let me just say! Mongolian beef spicy, salt and pepper shrimp, bbq pork fries rice and war wonton soup. Everything i had from this place was  super fresh,hot(spicy) and amazing just how i like it. I would like to thank the staff they were patient and assisted me with ordering since it was my first time there.  Pic of bbq fried rice, after math of what my family devoured."}
{"text":"The service was okay. My food I am sure would have been good had it been served hot. We went on a weekday for dinner and it was not busy. We were seated quickly and served our food immediately which had me wondering they probably had a buffet back there and where not preparing dishes as they were ordered. The orange chicken was not breaded and no one liked it. The BBQ pork fried rice was good but cold. I would rather go to Panda Express and know what I am getting and get more for my money."}
{"text":"This place is good! But I have a dilemma why only six shrimps every time in the shrimp fried rice! Cheap fucking bastards!"}
{"text":"If your looking for authentic Chinese food, this is the place! The staff is really nice and the food was excellent. We ordered beef broccoli, kung pao chicken and veggie low mein. It came with soup, egg roll, chicken wing and fried rice. It was our first time here and we are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great....but not the best. Being that I am used to different style of Chinese food my review might be a little off. I liked the food and service. It is quiet and great to take friends. They put too much sauce on their food. I liked it and will go again."}
{"text":"Service was much improved last night and the food was as good as always. Glad things are back to normal and we can continue to enjoy Wong's."}
{"text":"Had a delicious and inexpensive lunch there today- Mongolian Chicken for under $7. Lunch combo included soup, egg roll, fried rice and crab puffs. Very solid meal overall. The Mongolian was labeled as spicy but pretty mild."}
{"text":"All I can say is... Wow!!! The food here is amazing and the service is beyond compare. My husband and I came and had the cream puffs and pot-stickers for appetizers and they were so flavorful. For the main course, we had the Happy Family and the Mongolian Beef... both were wonderful and we ended up taking left overs home. The service here was so pleasant and fast. The food was served hot and my husband never saw the bottom of his glass. I will definitely be back and will be recommending this place to everyone we know. The best Chinese in Phx, no doubt."}
{"text":"I saw Wong's because I drove through the area and noticed two cops having a conversation in their cruisers in the parking lot. Their sign was well-lit in the corner and I had never noticed it before, so I went it. I was very pleased to see an actual Chinese restaurant instead of one out of a million buffets or Panda Express-like shops. They do take-out, which was great for me being on a schedule. I figured I would try something simple, so I went with their Shrimp Fried Rice.

Their Shrimp Fried Rice is easily comparable to the health quality of Pick Up Stix's fried rice with SO much more flavor! I was blown away! I'm eager to head back to Wong's very very soon to try their Chicken Egg Foo Yong. I'm a firm believer that trying a Chinese restaurant's Egg Foo Yong strongly illustrates their quality of food. 

The dining room was very nicely set up. Simple, yet elegant, and a wonderful cream and gold color scheme throughout the dining room made it seem very inviting and calm.

I will post more on this place when I've tried their Egg Foo Yong, but in the meantime, do not pass this place up! It's a little tough to see if you're heading Eastbound on Indian School Rd. but it's on the North side of the street, right across from the Fry's Supermarket plaza."}
{"text":"This is excellent Chinese food. I had the chicken low mein & the egg rolls. You won't find better. Especially in this area. The customer service was also great. This is where I'll bring my out of town guest."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious.  First timer. The fried rice is really delicious compared to other restaurants.  The cream puffs are delicious and full of flavor!  I would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Having come from L.A we were used to sit down Chinese restaurants ,not fast food like Panda Express, so we have been dying for some place like Wong's.
We have just moved into the area and spotted the restaurant across from Fry's supermarket and decided to go in and look at it before trying it.
Yipee! A sit down restaurant, outdated, yes but they actually use tablecloths and napkins.
We came back the next evening and we were pleasantly surprised at the offerings. Different types noodles, different protein selections and for me? Different veggie dishes with Tofu that can be added.
The hubs ordered Sweet and Sour Pork, Pork Fried rice and a beer and myself Kung Pao veggies with added tofu. All I can say is YUM! 
Portions are more than enough for two or three, so we had leftovers for lunch and late night snack.
We have since been back several times and tried other dishes and they were just fine.
Service has been great, no problems. We are asked if we would like to order something to drink, I prefer water or the hot tea that comes with the meal.
The ladies there are very friendly and attentive. Water is refilled literally within seconds of emptying the glass.
Now, we have been lucky to get there when it's not terribly busy so the food comes fast. My hubs says he's not sure if its microwaved as others have thought on previous reviews. As for me I think it comes fast because we have been the only ones there or only the second seated table on the premises .
Yes, the decor is dated. It could use an update but I think the food is the treat. Hubs says the bathroom is clean, I haven't visited the women's restroom yet. Everything else has been clean and tidy when we have been there.
We will be back!  ...more items to try :)"}
{"text":"This is gunna be my new go to for classic Chinese food. Egg foo young was some of the best I've had. The waitress was super nice and something special bout those egg rolls, mmmm"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a really good American Chinese restaurant, well this one is YUMMY! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We were in the area today and found this gem of a place to stop for lunch.  Really enjoyed our meal and the service was outstanding!!"}
{"text":"This place is not bad at all. Party of five with one baby. We were the only customers since it just opened. 
We all ordered something different; Happy Family, Twice Cooked Pork, Fried Rice, Shrimp Lo Mein, Sweet & Sour Chicken, and Chicken Wings.
Food was good, though I wasn't too fond of the Pork. I have ordered that at other places and it looks/tastes different than what I am used to. 
The servers did not ask us for drinks, we had to ask.. otherwise we all would have just drank hot tea and water. Fantastic customer service and smiles. Every single employee had smiles on their faces and tried to talk to you like if you were a friend. 
Not sure about the pricing as I was in the dark when the bill came and went due to it being a treat for everyone."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and portions!!! Restaurant spotless, staff very knowledgeable and pleasant!!! We were treated like family. Portions were huge and clearly very fresh. We were so thrilled we finally stopped to try this restaurant. We will definitely return again and again to try everything on the gigantic menu. There is something on the menu for all tastes. Wow!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm biased with the five stars cuz this place is just like the Chinese food favorite back home. Everyone I know says it's great too, so it's that good. The service is quick and freshly cooked. The staff is polite, professional, and geniune Chinese. Oh, and to-go orders are well packed usually in a cardboard box. If you like hot ask for the house mustard!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their orange chicken is delicious, it's not breaded and deep fried like most other places. And the sauce for it is a perfect sticky sauce. They serve free hot tea to the table, as much as you want! And the tea is really good. You can add \"112\" to any meal which makes it a combo with soup, egg roll, and crab puffs. Their egg rolls are big and crispy! Other dishes we like are sesame chicken, happy family (amazing sauce!), and the Singapore curry noodles.

Looks are deceiving, it's much bigger inside than it looks from the outside. Tables are draped with white table cloths and there are cloth napkins. It's still a casual place but with those little extra touches. Honestly, the tea seals the deal! We go through at least two pots each time we're there."}
{"text":"I love this place. My roomie and I found this place thru Yelp and tried a few months ago. Now we go every Friday night! 

We share the Emperor's Chicken which to us, is like General Tso's chicken. We like a little spicy and sweet, so we order it 2x spicy and add our own veggies. The cook, Ming is awesome. He makes it right everytime we ask for him! The entree is huge, there is plenty for two people plus a little leftovers.

We order the #112 to the entree which is like $3.00, crab puffs, one eggroll and soup."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!!!! What an incredible meal that we just had. We've been looking for a good Chinese restaurant for years and finally found one. If I could come back tomorrow, I would!!

For our appetizer, we had egg roles, crab puffs and dumplings, all were great!! For our meal, we had the House Chicken, my wife had the Orange Chicken. Both were amazing!! Honestly the best Chinese food that we have had in years.

And the service, INCREDIBLE!!! They were so nice, friendly and welcoming!!! The restaurant was very clean. The food was priced reasonably. 

We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I think it's a phenomenal restaurant everything on the menu is exciting and amazing service there was very good very close to home I recommend it"}
{"text":"New ownership equals 5 stars! 
The new owners really have changed Wong's for the better!
The vegetables are plentiful and very fresh. I like the vegetable egg foo young.  It is smothered with fresh broccoli, carrots, green onion, pea pods etc. 
Also the vegetable fried rice is equally wonderful. 
We also love the orange chicken and Kung pao shrimp. 
This restaurant is a treat!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Chinese food, very friendly staff. The best Chinese I've had in AZ period.  Don't bother with the other places in the area this the only place to go.  If you like it spicy they'll make as hot as you can handle.  Their food is made onsite most places serve frozen junk they just heat up, not here. Their food is made fresh onsite and it shows."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in AZ for sure! Crab puffs were the BEST! Customer service is amazing! Nice family owned business! I live in California but was out visiting my sister in AZ. She always misses the authentic Chinese food in CA, but really enjoyed Wong's..she said it's the next best thing to CA Chinese food! And my sister is SUPER picky so you know it's good!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese I've had in a long time. Service is also top notch very attentive and friendly"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food around!!! Staff are very friendly and helpful.  Never had a bad meal!"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly. The food is great. It's clean and they have a nice portion size."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. 
I had a hard time recollecting my meal here... Nothing really stood out."}
{"text":"A nice clean restaurant. Always greeted as if they are happy we are here. The food for the most part is quite good. A few dishes that are not to our taste. but that could be us, not them."}
{"text":"Excellent service. The servers were very attentive we had the Mongolian Beef, orange shrimp, and sesame seed chicken. All three were absolutely great our drinks were constantly refilled I would definitely return to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Nice and clean Chinese resto! Their sesame chicken and shrimp and chicken kungpao are tasty! Egg drop soup is a good starter too!!"}
{"text":"10+ years my family has ate here! BEST IN THE WESTSIDE OF PHOENIX! Everything perfect every time! 5 Stars"}
{"text":"Was reading another review for other Chinese restaurant when someone mentioned they preferred Wong's so we decided to go try it. Was nicely greeted at door and seated in a nice booth. I noticed they had my favourite menu item on lunch menu, Cashew chicken, now being we have lived in California and Colorado it's always brown sauce, I never heard of white sauce, but tried it here in Arizona and didn't like it. So when she asked which one I preferred I knew it was going to be good. And it was. Hubby mostly orders LoMein, he says if it's good he's happy, and it was. We both loved the wontons with cream cheese, and I like egg drop soup and it was equally good. So thank you fellow yelper, we have found another great restaurant to revisit. All the lady servers came by to see if we needed anything, did not rush to bring the check which I appreciate. I do wish it was closer 25 minute drive but have gone much farther  in the past."}
{"text":"I ordered the imperial family dinner of 4 with an order of pot stickers and beef lo Mein  with havezero complaints. Friendliest staff ever 100/5"}
{"text":"If you're tired of the ordinary Chinese buffet, and would like to try some clean, fresh, and more authentic Chinese food, then this is the place for you. Without seeing the reviews on the internet, I probably would have never given this place a chance. Very clean setting on the inside with very friendly staff. They had a pretty good menu that had dishes outside of Sweet N Sour Chicken. They actually had some more authentic style dishes including Chow Fun, Mapo Tofu and various seafood dishes. We tried a pretty basic lineup of Mongolian Beef and Emperors Chicken. If you know anything about Chinese food, you're probably familiar with the \"smokey, grilled\" taste that you get from the wok. The beef had this taste. It was authentic. 

Check in with Yelp and they'll give you a free half order of Crab Puffs (5) which were amazing by the way. Such a simple and common dish, but this place had one of the best I've had. 

If you're into vegetables, they have some pretty good selections. They're pretty pricey though (not uncommon at Chinese restaurants). We ordered the seasonal Sauteed Chinese Vegetables; market price was about 10 bucks. Although delicious, the price seemed to bother my carnivorous belly, and I instantly regretted not ordering some Chow Fun noodles instead. 

Overall, a great restaurant that is definitely hidden but pretty visible on the internet if you search for good Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Not all chinese restaurants are the same.
Wong's Chinese Cuisine is so much netter than the rest!
You can tell the owners pick the best products and freshest ingredients to serve their clients.
Everything is lighter and crisp/fresh.
I'm a huge fan!
Hot and sour soup...delicious!
My friend lives for their egg drop soup.
Its our go to lunch spot.
The sesame chicken featured below isn't fatty deep fried balls of chicken frenched in oversweet sauce like other places.
Its top notch quality of homemade good cooking.
Flavorful fried rice and yummy eggroll.
We also had the dumplings and they were cooked deliciously.
David is the nicest guy and comes over to check on everything.
All the staff remember you and are always serving with a smile.
People speak english and make you feel welcome.
Roomy dining room and plenty of parking.
They have great hours and you can call for takeout.
No delivery but you will want to eat here!"}
{"text":"Favorite Chinese Food Restaurant in the entire west valley!!! They are always so welcoming and the food is always great! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Finding good authentic Chinese food is a bit of a challenge nowaday. Wong's Restaurant has been around for years, and I grew up in the same little \"edge of Phoenix\" neighborhood that Wong's is located in. From the outside, Wong's looks small, but on the inside, it's huge and \"wedding reception\"ish. I've been going to Wong's for a long time and have yet to find a better Sesame Chicken. It is their best dish! They have great lunch specials worth every last penny. They have a lot of staff at Wong's and they are all quick and very courteous to their patrons. I would highly recommend Wong's to anyone looking for a true Chinese positive dining experience :)"}
{"text":"My absolute fav place to eat. They are friendly and professional.  I recently moved to Arizona and I have been searching Around for new places to eat out with the family and I stumbled upon this jewel. They even know my name and order already !!"}
{"text":"This is the best chinese food i have tasted in a long time.  I have lived on this side of town for 10 years and cant believe i havent ate at this gem, i have everywhere else and i can tell you this is good chinese food and the price isnt bad either.  I will definately be coming again."}
{"text":"We have been going to Wongs six years. It has changed ownership once in that time. They treated us like family then and still do now with the new owners. We have yet to have a bad dish. Our favorites are Singapore Rice Noodles, Beef Cantonese noodle and Orange chicken that you can get with habanero. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I've searched all over to find good Chinese cuisine. This place is amazing, food is wonderful highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food, white tablecloths, friendly family, fast service, clean, bright room, reasonable prices. Place always makes us happy, always leaves me stuffed to the gills. My favorite: the orange beef (ask for extra crispy) beats P. F. Chang's. My only complaint: no brown rice."}
{"text":"I like everything that I have ordered so far.  My new place for Chinese food.  My kids are Orange Chicken freaks so we had that.  I think it had a good balance between sweet and spicy.  Maybe more spicy but I think they ask you if you want it spicy.  We also got the Emperor's Chicken.  That will now be another staple in my household.  Definitely give this place a try.  It's clean and very roomy but cozy. Can't wait to try more dishes."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Crab puffs were very good. Orange chicken and Singapore Noodles were nothing spectacular. Good service. Good price. I would go to Panda Express just because food taste same and I can go through the drive through ."}
{"text":"The Moo-Sho shrimp was delicious and the Shrimp Chop Suey was too.  Thank you for the excellent experience.  Sure to visit again.  The 30 minute drive was worth it."}
{"text":"Great service, nice size portions, and then food had lots of flavor. I ordered the sesame chicken with fried rice. I just wish their sesame chicken came with vegetables."}
{"text":"I reeeally want to love Wong's as much as my boyfriend does. I just can't. 

Before I started eating chicken again, I'd always ordered the sweet & sour tofu or the broccoli & oyster sauce. They weren't exciting, but they had flavor. I recently ordered their chicken and (soft noodle) chow mein dish. The entire dish was kind of plain tasting, but there was a light brown/yellow-ish goo covering all of it. I tried to like it, I really did. I just couldn't get past the Chicken from a Can taste to it. 

Also, we had a waitress who was apparently new. She was extremely sweet and tried really hard to get everything right. I didn't mind so much that she forgot our rice (she's new it happens). I was bothered by the normal wait staff who all just stood there and watched her as she struggled to help four or five tables (the only groups in the place on a Sunday afternoon) instead of helping her out. They also kept yelling at her in Chinese, which I thought was very rude for them to do in front of the people she's trying to help. The lady who fills water glasses after so much as a sip doesn't count-- she was on her game, haha.

I don't plan on going back for some time. 
As usual, I had a stomach ache after eating here and I just couldn't get the awful chicken taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"i have been a loyal customer for at least 5 years. i have never ordered a plate i didnt like. would be a 5 star if the service was a little better. except for mae the waitress..shes the best. i really like that they will customize your food to how spicy you want. the most ive been able to handle is the 10 x spicy beef lo mein!!!"}
{"text":"Over all good flavor. Tried Mongolian beef, sesame chicken, wongs lo mein and pork fried rice. Fried rice was missing something not as flavor full as the others."}
{"text":"We have a 4 hour layover in FLL and we are visiting Mario's  Catalina Restaurant.  The food the service is unreal.  Love this little place of heaven."}
{"text":"I've been craving good Chinese food. Specifically sweet and sour chicken. Being Thai I'm very picky about Asian restaurants. There are very few I like. I guess I'm an Asian food snob but growing up eating the best home cooked Asian food especially Thai spoiled me. Anyway I read the review for Wongs and it's less than 2 miles from my house so I thought I'd give them a try. 

I ordered the salt and pepper wings and sweet and sour chicken but when I brought it home it wasn't sweet and sour chicken it was orange chicken. Luckily I like orange chicken and this orange chicken was flippin' amazing. It's so good! Almost as good as my orange chicken. The salt and pepper wings were really good too and not spicy unless you eat the jalapeños that come with them which I did cause I like a kick. 

I was not disappointed taste wise and that's saying a lot. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I received the wrong entree. But I was pleasantly surprised with how good the orange chicken was. So I have high hopes for when I return to try  the sweet and sour chicken."}
{"text":"First time here! We were seated right away, the place was pretty busy for a Sunday evening. Waitress came quick to take our drink order, upon her return with drinks, we ordered  Bo-bo platter. It consisted of egg rolls, beef skewers, fried shrimp, chicken wing and pork ribs. 
Main course came out quickly and it was steaming hot and fresh. One order of BBQ pork fried rice and an order of beef lo mein. I always ask for sweet n sour sauce and hot mustard, hot mustard was exceptional. 
Waitress came back several times, if she was unavailable anyone walking by would ask if we needed anything. 
Plates were so full of food that we are taking half of it home. 
Only complaint is that there was a birthday party here and the kids keep blowing horns. After a while it became annoying while trying to have a conversation at the table. Was not Wongs fault, just the parents of the birthday party."}
{"text":"This is our go to Chinese place,  whether we dine in our take out.
Staff is always friendly and food is great!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Wong's for years.  The food was always excellent,  The service was outstanding. They recently changed ownership, and we were concerned the quality may change.  We were just there last week.   It is still one of the best Chinese restaurants in the valley.  The quality and quantity of food is exceptional.  They maintain consistency and you can always expect an excellent meal.   If you want an even better experience ask for Mei to be your waitress."}
{"text":"The staff is helpful and very courteous. Its a little outdated inside, but clean.  My favorite dish is the Eggplant, and is a specialty dish. This place hits the spot better then fast food chinese spots. Prices are reasonable, and they can accomodate large groups easily.  I like many of the dishes, but I am not convinved enough to say this is the best chinese food in the West Valley."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese Food!! Order on line and take it home, but make sure you call to confirm before arriving for your order because sometimes they miss it and you still have to wait. But I love their food, especially their Thai noodles."}
{"text":"Uhm, WOW. Wow. I can't imagine eating at any other Chinese restaurant in Phoenix after tonight. I don't want to. My entire experience was amazing - from our hosts genuine politeness and speediness, to our servers attentiveness and great personality, and of course, the food.

I had the beef chow fun - now I LOVE chow fun, and used to get some pretty legit stuff back home - but this was probably one of the best, if not THE best chow fun I've ever had.

I also had the egg rolls as an appetizer, thinking they'd be the average fried app you find at most restaurant - no, no. Not these. These were definitely the best egg rolls I've ever had. They tasted like the chefs grandma was in the back making them from an old family recipe that's been passed down for generations. The vegetable selection in them was delish, and the spices and seasoning were classic, but had a little special something that was really doing it for me.

My boyfriend got 2 dishes (I believe they were off the specials menu), and loved them both. I sampled them both and thought they were both really tasty considering they weren't dishes I would normally try. His brother got the Mongolian beef - loved it. I snagged a few bites of his as well haha, and again, loved it. The rice they serve is on point too. You know it's legit when they serve it in a pot with an ACTUAL rice paddle.

If you're still reading through comments trying to figure out if you should come here, do yourself a favor and just come here. At the very least, bookmark it for those days when you work late and don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've tried this restaurant and I was pleasantly pleased, the moo goo gai pan, the chicken fried rice and the egg drop soup were very excellently prepared and huge portions this will not be the last time I visited this restaurant."}
{"text":"I took my kids here. The food was amazing, we had orange chicken and rice. It was soooo good, I have never tasted orange chicken with that much flavor from any other place. This is now Our new Chinese spot. They had a nice layout, and the employees were very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Despite the fact I no longer live in the west valley, I've enjoyed dining at Wong's Chinese Cuisine over the last few years in the form of takeout. Those experiences let me know that Wong's was still an excellent restaurant. Finally, this weekend, I had an opportunity to enjoy another sit down meal at my favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley!

This was not a special occasion. It was just an opportunity to enjoy lunch with my girlfriend, some family and a friend. Wong's made our lunch feel like a special occasion! The greeting at the lobby and the super friendly disposition of our servers was remarkable.

I was introduced to Wong's about 20 years ago by a good friend. It hasn't changed much (although I noticed a new menu which highlighted several new dishes). The dining room has a timeless, classiness about it. Everything is incredibly clean and very well maintained. Consider this, how many times have you been seated and felt the urge to remark about how clean and shiny the silverware is? What does that say about the places you typically dine at?

Our group was very hungry and concerned that the lunch menu we were given would skimp on the portions. For starters, we ordered (and enjoyed) the crab puffs, pot stickers and an order of Yu Shan Fried Rice (actually an entree). The appetizers were all excellent. It's hard to screw up crab puffs, but even harder to make them this good! The pot stickers filling was a little bland but the dipping sauce helped. Also, they had a slightly crispier texture than your standard rubbery pot stickers. Everyone noticed the Yu Shan rice on the new menu, so I'm glad we ordered it for everyone to sample. It was hands down the best fried rice I've enjoyed. It features the usual assortment of veggies and egg, plus chunks of pork and small shrimp. There is a reason it's on the entree list. This would've been a great meal by itself.

My usual Mongolian Beef was excellent. The beef was seasoned well and nice and tender, but not as spicy as I recalled. And it featured a generous amount of onion, green onion and rice noodles. And those who were worried about skimpy portions began to regret all the appetizers. Each lunch entree came with egg drop soup, brown rice, a few crab puffs and a spring roll. Lunch was a great value and we took a lot of leftovers home.

As we left, one person in our group said \"Even if the food here was just okay, I'd come back for the service alone!\" Thank you Wong's for being the consistently excellent restaurant you've always been!"}
{"text":"We tried eating the food but it was just like trying to fry water, it's a YIKES and Eeks! Methinks not!

We also got the same service as Yelper Susan D. We got the impression that we were a bother coming in but we got that treatment from two women working there. But I did get a smile from the one woman when she saw we stopped trying to eat and left almost all our food and she offers boxes I say no then she says, \"YOU NO LIKE\" I just smiled back and that is when I got the smile or maybe she was holding in laughing not sure.

I will say I did like the hot tea we started out with and my husband got the $3 extra soup , egg roll , crab puff add on . My husband thought the soup was good and the egg roll was crispy . I ate the crab puffs and they were fried nice and the oil seemed fresh I thought the crab puffs were better than most places because they almost looked like crabs . At this point the service didn't bother me because I thought the food would be good .

I ordered the spicy eggplant with chicken and I don't know how it was prepared but the chicken was minced unseasoned  hard and dry , the chicken was NOT EDIBLE . The sauce was not spicy it was like they dumped egg drop soup (with out the egg) over the chicken and stir fried eggplant. The thick chicken soup or sauce didn't taste good it seemed house made but it seemed like they didn't use any aromatics or salt or pepper in preparation and instead of good the sauce tasted like the way raw chicken smells also lacking any Asian Seasoning . Wong's was generous with the amount of eggplant in my dish but I couldn't stomach the sauce on it. I ate mostly steamed rice I think it was regular rice because it fell off my fork and didn't stick.

My husband ordered the Szechan Beef and neither of us could eat that one either although it was very slightly better than the spicy eggplant chicken . The beef was tough but it was seasoned but not in a good way it was very salty and I think like you dumped soy sauce on it . The sauce tasted very thick like brown gravy mixed with soy sauce and vegetables were mostly celery and a few mushrooms .

I know I already said enough but depending on where you sit in the dining room you might have a strangers butt near your face because half the dining room is raised and you might be next to that and who know, that person might need beano .

I would NEVER SAY not to go here, You might like your food that way. Also I am guessing and Hope the REAL COOK wasn't on and they are normally better....I HOPE

My husband left hungry and stopped at the Hot Diggity Dog Cafe Cart that sets up at the Home Depot Parking lot on Bell and 67TH he said the $4. Chicago Style dog was really good and said he'd stop there whenever we get bad food out. I lost my appetite."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to Wong's and it won't be my last! Upon entering I was greeted with a smile. I ordered to-go so I cannot speak of the dine in experience. As I ordered my food I was asked questions about the food in order to make sure I was going to receive what I was expecting because there are many variations that it's prepared at different restaurants. After submitting my order I was offered water as I wait which showed they care about their customers. The wait was only 10min. When opening the food at home, everything was to my satisfaction. For being in boxes the food still had an appetizing presentation. The food was delicious! I had the Orange chicken, sesame chicken, beef n broccoli, shrimp lo mein and BBQ pork fried rice. No complaints on any of these items. Definitely give Wong's a try if in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We order from here quite often. Good food at a decent price.  The staff is always friendly. They make it to order but the wait still isn't very long.  I love their pork fried rice and orange chicken. Oh,  and the portions are large."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. My husband and I relocated to Phoenix from the Midwest and we were looking for Chinese food that satisfies our cravings. We tried Wing's based on a recommendation from one of his coworkers who stumbled upon it. I'm so glad we did. On our first visit my husband ordered the teriyaki chicken and I ordered the Happy Family. 

Teriyaki chicken wasn't my husband's favorite, as he prefers white meat and it was made with dark meat chicken. It came on a bed of broccoli, which he also is not a fan of. I tasted it, and it tasted ok to me. I was not a huge fan of the sauce vs. the broccoli & dark meat. Overall it tasted fine, for those who don't have a preference on meat cut or an aversion to broccoli. I give it a 3/5 rating.

Happy family was absolutely awesome. It is a mix of chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, pea pods, watercrest, bamboo, broccoli, all cooked on a brown sauce that was soooooo delicious. Note: order extra brown sauce, it's delicious. This is my go to order here EVERY TIME. It's amazing. I give it a 5/5 rating.

The entrees come with steamed white rice in a container that keeps it warm at your table (which was a plus for me because I'm a slow eater but I demand that my food stay hot). The entrees are so freshly made that they steam and stay hot while you're eating. The serving size is always more than enough that you'll have leftovers to take home. The food comes out hot, fresh, well seasoned every time. 

Since our initial visit we have returned several times. I've come with my college aged niece and she loved it too. We both got Happy Family on our next visit and shared the appetizer chicken wings (non-breaded and crispy) and crab puffs (think crab Rangoon but in a circular shape) both were amazing as expected. 

I definitely recommend Wongs, as the service is prompt, and personable. We are always seated quickly and the wait staff remember you. They always remember me because I come with my 2 month old son, and they are very nice. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was a kid...15 years later and it is still one of my favorite places to eat...GREAT service GREAT food...everybody I know LOVES wongs!"}
{"text":"We are celebrating my nephew's b-day here @ Wongs.  As always the food is excellent and the service is promt. We all enjoyed our dinner. Our waitress Mei always makes us feel welcome! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their crab rangoons are so good. They are stuffed with filling! The orange chicken is delicious as well as pretty much everything I have had there. You can't go wrong with anything you order. I have had the beef with broccoli, sesame chicken, Singapore noodles, chow Meir, egg rolls, and orange chicken and everything is always super fresh. The prices are reasonable and the staff are always very friendly. We usually do takeout but we have eaten there before and it's clean and enjoyable, unlike some hole in the wall Chinese places. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Let me just add our praises to this little gem. Went on a spur of the moment for dinner and read the YELP! reviews. It's a good size and had white table clothes (a nice touch). Very adequate menu selections. We added the crab puffs, egg rolls and soup ($3) to our dinner entrees.  TOO MUCH FOOD. Everything was quite nice. We really do deserve a nice place for dinner out in this area. Good food, reasonable cost and attentive service.  Thank you, Wong's!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food that I've found in Phoenix. We got the crab won tons, chicken wings, and orange chicken. The orange chicken is so crispy and flavorful. They didn't skimp on anything, there was tons of rice and chicken, enough for lunch tomorrow. We will definitely be back! So glad to have finally found great Chinese food in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing.  Pad Thai chicken & shrimp, egg rolls and crab balls were all very deliciously. Lightening fast service with a smile.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food in the area. Five years ago, I had Wongs at home, and it was pretty delicious. Last night, I decided to return with my fiancee. He ordered the sweet and sour pork and I had the Happy Family. The sweet and sour pork was basically flavorless balls of pork with very little sweet and sour sauce. It was okay. My Happy Family meal was good, but the sauce was heavy on the salt. Also, the chicken tasted awful. The three shrimp in the meal were delicious. The tea tasted like straw found in a barn. We will not be back. Also, upon leaving, the owner said \"Bye Mrs and Mr Skinny\" as the people laughed. It may be funny to some, but if you are trying to keep people coming back, you should not make fun of them as they leave. We will continue going to AJK cuisine on Dysart and McDowell, which delivers the highest customer service I have ever seen at a Chinese restaurant and  also has the best Chinese food in the west valley."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife for the first time based on the reviews, and it did not disappoint! Great little place with awesome food and great service. Very flavorful food with large portions at very reasonable prices. Egg drop soup for $1.50 and awesome egg rolls. Love the food. So excited that we found a great Chinese food place close to our house. We will definitely be back again many times and with our family. Please give this place a try and help support local family owned businesses. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"After eating at Wong's, you'll  hate yourself for having ever had Panda Express.

The first thing you notice about Wong's is how misleading the outside is. It's wedged between a used book store and a bridal store and looks about as big as a taco truck. You get inside, however, and a large, superbly decorated dining room awaits you. I have never, in all the years I've gone to Wong's, waited for a table. Literally, I'm seated half a minute within entering. Even during the lunch rush, there's always room. 

Tea is provided, and between that and the water, you probably won't want to order a coke or anything. The tea takes some getting used to, but soon you won't be able to eat lo mein without it. And expect to get your water glass refilled like at least a dozen times. Literally, I've never actually finished a glass of water before it was refilled. 

The staff is so accommodating and hospitable, it's like eating in a family's dining room table. The service is so on par that out of the years I've been going, only one guy has ever complained about his food. Have you ever seen other patrons at a restaurant tell a complaining customer to STFU? Well, that's how awesome Wong's is. No joke.

The food is, like, whoa. Personally I prefer the lunch specials, where you get the entree, fried rice, egg roll and soup for about the cost of a McMeal Deal. Dinner comes with a big pot of rice that you and your friends will never finish so don't even try.

Foods I Recommend: Pork Lo Mein, Emperor's Chicken, Shrimp Lo Mein, Sweet and Sour Pork, Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Sesame Chicken, and Chow Mein.

The menu they offer is also super easy to understand, with clear cut descriptions of all the entrees, which is nice, because nothing irritates me more than a Chinese eatery that serves you soft noodles and calls it \"chow mein\"."}
{"text":"AMAZING. The only thing I could possibly complain about is they don't deliver, but it's worth going and picking it up."}
{"text":"Great alternative to buffet Chinese. Huge portions and cooked to order. Lunch specials come with more food than one should eat! Pleasant staff and decent atmosphere. I will eat there again."}
{"text":"So I tried this place out after reading someone say \"the best place on the west side\" TOTALLY agree. It is so disappointing when you crave Chinese food and you go somewhere that just doesn't do it. I can say after eating here I doubt I'll go anywhere else.
We ordered war wonton, crab puffs, sweet and sour chicken, Mongolian beef, BBQ pork fried rice and vegetable lo mein. Everything was spectacular."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on reviews. The food was obviously pre made and like warm at best. The fried rice was terrible. I'm not sure how this place is getting such a high rating but you can go to panda express and get a better meal."}
{"text":"This place is authentic and great!! The people and the service were exceptional! We had a party of 13 for my daughters birthday and they even presented her with a slice of cheesecake! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yup probably the best Chinese food I've found in phoenix. Orange chicken was sooo good! Mongolian beef was probably the best I've had- actually tender beef instead of dry over cooked beef that you would get somewhere else. We will totally be back!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints. Good customer service. Good food. Very thorough. My only criticism is sometimes the eggrolls are cold on the inside."}
{"text":"Great takeout food after a long week. Great customer service and we will be coming back."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and even after moving across town, we come back whenever we get the chance. 

We recently came here for my dad's birthday and had a group of 10. I made a reservation the night before and they had the table ready for us, even when we came 10 minutes before we were told to arrive. 

Everything we have tried on their menu has ten delicious, and if you have a big group I recommend ordering a variety of items and sharing. They have a spinning circle in the middle of your table to make passing the food around easy. 

The owners and all of the employees are so kind and helpful. Please add this to your list of go-to chinese restaurants. (they are extremely kid friendly and went above and beyond to make sure the kids were as taken care of as the adults!)"}
{"text":"Made our first visit to Wong's today for lunch.  We were cheerfully greeted and seated. The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated.  After looking over the lunch menu my wife decided on the Kung Pao Chicken mild spice (#1) and I ordered the Sun Devil Chicken spicy (#3).  Our waitress asked how we found this place (Yelp search of local Chinese restaurants) and mentioned they offered free egg rolls with Yelp Check In, very nice gesture!  Our meals arrived quickly. They were both very tasty with generous portions.  Our food was spiced perfectly. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Service was top notch with multiple table checks and refills of our beverages.  We found our new Chinese place and will return!"}
{"text":"Was the best, still the best, and will always be the best Chinese food out there. The staff are some of the nicest ladies I know and treat you like family. The food, oh the food, it is so dang good. From the beef chow fun to the amazing spicy wonton soup, their food is all on point. If my fellow yelpers still have not hit up this hidden gem, you have to go. My latest visit was on a Friday night and so glad to see their business was very busy. They deserve great financial success given they excel in all areas. Wongs rocks!!!!!! As always"}
{"text":"Delicious! I'm so happy I've found a go-to for Chinese in AZ. Also, make sure you search the correct WONG's address, unlike myself, I wazed the name Wong's for the restaurant and I accidentally chose the wrong location  turned back around and finally got to the correct restaurant, and it was even closer to our stay than I thought. Perfect. As soon as I enter, other customers were raving about this place. One even said he drove from Mesa to eat there. Great sign. It was busy. 
Decor~wise, it's an older restaurant. Spacious parking lot. Dining room looks dated, but clean and bright; as long as the food is delicious, that's all I need.  My takeout order was ready. I checked in via Yelp, and redeemed a delicious half order of the crab puffs, which seems like a crowd favorite.  We ordered the Mongolian Chicken, extra steam rice, Singapore Noodles, and Sweet and Sour Chicken with the sauce on the side. My FAVORITE part of all their entrees is they use WHITE MEAT CHICKEN. Delicious! Portions are generous and plentiful. I will definitely return on my next trip to AZ."}
{"text":"Great simple Chinese food. We've been going here off and on for years and I'm addicted to their garlic chicken. Staff is helpful, prices are reasonable, and the portions are generous. A good, safe bet for Chinese food."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to places for Chinese food. I usually dine it but this time I got take out. Friendly on the phone, and food was on time and done when they said it would be , no waiting! Good amount of food for the price as well. Got the peppered beef this time, didn't short on the beef and veggies were cooked."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for lunch after reading the good reviews.  We were not disappointed.
The place is very clean, everyone was very friendly, and the food was outstanding and very fresh.  What a great experience!  We will never eat Chinese food anywhere else, because  we will not find a better place."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times over the years while visiting my Grandma. Can't remember ever having a bad meal... 

Food is good, and prices are very reasonable. Staff is friendly and always coming around to refill water/tea. They are very knowledgeable about the food, if you need a recommendation, just ask. If you are in the area, swing by and enjoy some very savory Chinese food! 

Order the Sesame Chicken!"}
{"text":"We started the evening with delicious egg rolls, complimentary for checking in on Yelp! They were crispy on the outside and flavorful on the inside and the sweet and sour sauce is a perfect compliment. The salt & pepper wings were perfectly seasoned with the right amount of heat from the grilled jalapeños. The Chinese sausage fried rice had a great balance of sweet and savory and was perfect with the shrimp and black bean sauce. The emperors chicken was delicious fried white meat with a savory sauce with just a touch of spice. The service is super friendly and perfectly attentive while not being overbearing. Very consistent over the years!"}
{"text":"Great Chinese! Very inexpensive delicious. We had shrimp with lobster sauce and it was perfect. No overlooked shrimp! Yeah. We also had pork lo mein and asked for extra veggies and they were very accommodating. We will return whenever we are in the area."}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover! Walk inside and you're invited into a awesome Chinese traditional restaurant, with friendly staff, and great food. We had the dinner for two special and everything was just right! I rated it a 4 because refill service was slow at first but came back after dinner was served. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese restaurants you can find on the west side. I've only placed orders for takeout.  I love the beef chow fun, House special chicken, and chicken Cantonese noodles.  I need to try other items off the menu."}
{"text":"We used to go to China Red Cafe, until we tried this place- salt and pepper shrimp, Emperor's Chicken, Beef chow fun, BBQ fried rice 
If you are really hungry add Yummy crab puffs, an egg roll,  and wonton soup all for only $3 more
YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese resturant I have ever been to. I haven been going to Wongs for over ten years and it has never disappointed me in any way. Great food and wondeful ambiance. Love this place!"}
{"text":"As a tryout I ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Pork Fried Rice and Egg Rolls as takeaway. The result was a tasteless, Kung Pao Chicken, a tasteless fried rice, and C+ egg rolls. Not cheap, and a disappointing experience. I chose the place after reading some of the 4+ stars on Yelp. In any event, caveat emptor. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"we have been going to wings for many years. the past few years the food is not what it uses to be. we have heard they have new owners.
last night I ordered Mongolian beef, they use very little green onion and most, about 95% of the meal was yellow onion. I had maybe 5 pieces of meat and the sauce was a orange red oil. 
guess I need to find a new Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"The beef chow fun and salt and pepper shrimp are both really good. The customer service is good too"}
{"text":"If you have never been to Wongs.. get into your car and go asap!! 

Positives:
I have nothing BUT positives to say about this place.  We live in Goodyear but gladly drive a few minutes to eat at Wongs.  The atmosphere is relaxing, we enjoy it. The staff is extremely kind and friendly. We always have fun when we go! They always seem to brighten our day and we leave with a smile. Very personable staff!!! 

Now, on to the food. We absolutely LOVE their food!!!! We have been several times and always order something new and are never let down!  Here are a few of my suggestions to try:

Orange Chicken
Beef Chow Fun
Sesame Chicken
Sweet and Sour Chicken
Emperor's Chicken (a little spicy)
Moo Shu Pork
Lo Mein Noodles
Dumpling Soup

Each one is delicious and packed with flavor. I have to say..  TRY the dumpling soup as a starter!!!!!!!! Even if you aren't a big soup fan, these flavors will baffle you with how good and unique they are.  Every single dish we got was perfect and wonderful. The Lo Mein noodles go great with every entree.

 My 11 year old daughter picked Wongs for her birthday dinner (smart girl) and they gave us two orders of Crab Puffs (not sure if this is what they call them there) for FREE! We had a large group and we were so very happy with this gracious dish. Yum! They snuck out and brought my daughter some ice cream with a candle and sang her Happy Birthday with pure joy in their hearts   

Negatives:
N O N E!

Tips:
You gotta try it."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Chinese Restaurant in AZ. I've been coming for over 10 years and I haven't found a better spot then this.... I come at least 3 times a month. If your in the area is a must..... My fav dishes are Kung Pao shrimp and the special Lo Mein...."}
{"text":"This is an awesome Chinese place. The sesame chicken is to die for and you can't forget about the crab puffs. Yummy."}
{"text":"Seriously great food! It's changed hands recently and it only got better!!

They only serve white meat chicken in every dish! Never any grizzle / chewy pieces, you can taste the love they put in to make sure their food stands out from the normal Chinese/Asian restaurants. By far my favorite spot in the valley and it's just been bumped up to 6 stars with the change in ownership. 

The orange chicken (remember no grizzle) isn't like your typical breaded fluff with a tiny piece of dark meat chicken inside, this is all white meat with a light batter, amazing.  

The Happy Family has a little of everything beef, chicken, red pork, and shrimp...big juicy shrimp. 

Lastly, the Chicken Chow Fun is superb, the orange chicken used to be my wife's favorite till I brought home all three of the above, and now she craves the chow fun. 

I'll say this, as I think it should be said, I can't get my wife to eat Chinese style food anywhere, she only eats at wongs. She doesn't like the grizzly bits that every other place uses to cut corners and increase their margins. 

The staff is awesome, super friendly and will make you feel like you're truly a guest.  

Do yourself a favor and add this to your list of family run restaurants to visit, you won't be disappointed...this place is SO awesome that I'm currently sitting in another higher end Chinese Restaurant updating my review for wongs cause I wish I was there!"}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese food in the West Valley. We've tried them all and Wong's food quality and preparation is outstanding. Their hot & sour soup is wonderful brimming with shrimp ,mushrooms ,bamboo shoots,pork in a rich flavorful broth. Szechwan shrimp was loaded with shrimp and veggies with a pungent fresh sauce with ample heat. Happy family was also well done with shrimp, chicken, beef, broccoli in a tasty sauce prepared to my wife's taste in heat level. Noodles, fried rice all outstanding. Service was attentive and friendly with the owner present the entire evening. All of this and reasonably prices made this a great find for us. We will make Wongs are go to Chinese dining destination."}
{"text":"This place is perfect!!! Very kind and courteous staff and it is very clean.  Not only do they provide prompt and excellent customer service, the are very helpful in explaining the different dishes and comparing them to something similar.  Their Szechwan Shrimp and Sesame beef are to die for!!! I'd recommend this place to anyone coming over to Avondale for a visit!"}
{"text":"Being in town just for a couple days, we decided to try it. Husband and I were seated immediately. Service was excellent. People were friendly. Food was very tasty. The quality of meat was outstanding. Honored the yelp check-in offer.  Will be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Great service and food.  Looks like a hole in the wall but actually quite a large comfortable dining room."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant based on other Yelper's reviews.  I'd been seeking a great Chinese place in Goodyear since we moved in August 2011, and the only place I'd liked was Eest Chinese on Dysart.  I was in for a treat.

Visited at lunch and as I was seated, the waitress immediately brought over a small teapot of oolong.  It was warm and perfect for a rainy day, and I don't know any Chinese places that do this any more!  I ordered the Sweet/Sour Shrimp lunch entree (only $6.25!), and upgraded my soup for an extra .50 to Hot & Sour.  

When the waitress brought my soup, I requested \"crunchies\" (wonton strips), which she brought with no complaints.  The H&S soup was the best I've ever had!  Pepper spicy, it cleared my sinuses, but it was amazing. 

My food arrived quickly and the dish was steaming hot.  There was a huge serving of fried rice, an egg roll, two crab puffs and EIGHT beautiful fried shrimp on my plate!  The shrimp was tender, a little overfried, but I've been back since and it's been better.  The fried rice was deliciously tender and the egg roll was excellent, especially with their house-made Chinese mustard (WOO HOO, it's HOT!!).  The crab puffs weren't really crabby, mostly cream cheese, but they were good.

My total bill was $7.82!  Best Chinese I've had in a l-oooong time.

Picked up a take-out menu as i was leaving and noticed they had \"Almond Duck\" and \"Sweet & Sour Duck\" on the dinner menu.  I've been looking for \"Almond Duck\" -- square-shaped pressed duck covered in sweet/sour sauce and topped with almonds -- for the last 20 YEARS or so!  I'm going back to try both of these dishes on their menu! 

P.S. -- I've been once more since my first visit -- I took my son, who isn't really a Chinese fan, but he got the Moo Goo Gai Pan and LOVED it."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service, amazing restaurant! I probably shouldn't divulge my secret that is the awesomeness of Wangs because I don't have want to have to wait for a table ever, but it is the best Chinese food restaurant in the West Valley, if not all of Arizona! Tucked into a corner of a strip mall, it's easy to miss, but you don't want to miss this. We had the Orange Chicken and Wangs Fried Rice, plus the fried crab puffs and (OMG, the biggest, best) egg rolls. It was all amazing! No frozen food here, it's all clearly prepared in their kitchen. Just simply the best Chinese food around!"}
{"text":"Not even worth to try. No complaint for service and I respect that, but food quality was very poor. It felt like all microwaved food...specially when food comes to table in five minutes or less."}
{"text":"Great food,fast service,very friendly staff.
I can't wait to go back .The take out portions were excellent.I will recommend Wongs to everyone."}
{"text":"We tried this place the other night for the first time. They have great customer service, professional employees, a clean restaurant, and good food. Being new to the area we thought we'd try this place and we were very pleased. The only thing I wish is that the food had bolder flavors and were spicy hot like they said they would be. The egg rolls are the best I have ever had and we are excited to try some new items next time. Finding a Chinese spot is all trial and error. You should definitely give them a shot, we were overall pleased. We all have different taste buds so you decide! Good luck"}
{"text":"I have been going here for about 2 years now and I can say this is one of my absolute favorite restaurants. They provide excellent service and are always on top of making sure to refill water. Hot tea is served free of charge and it is delicious. The prices are astounding. My girlfriend and I can both eat there for under 20$ and end up being stuffed, and we can eat! We usually split the emperor's chicken and get 2 orders of eggrolls. The eggrolls are BY FAR the best I have ever had in Arizona, and I have lived here for 20 years. So if you're on the fence about this place you should stop by."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I had the orange chicken and was surprised by how the chicken felt like chicken. Ha! I came again and my favorite dish is now the broccoli beef. I should try other dishes but it's just too good. :)"}
{"text":"First tine visit to Wong's and it won't be the last. On business in Tolleson and found on Yelp. Travel 200+ days a year and best Chinese food I have had in the last year!  Hot and sour soup best by far. Egg rolls remind me of china town in New York.  Will probably be back next week. I am unbelievably happy and did I mention the chicken fried rice and the sesame chicken. Run don't walk to Wong's"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat if I'm headed North for any reason. I've even gone out of my way to get their Sesame Beef when I was craving it. 

Wong's service has always been prompt to sit my party and me down. They supply the menus and green tea quickly, and for the most part keep your glasses full. 

I've tried several of their dishes, but I always start off with egg drop soup, crab puffs and fried won-tons. All of these are tasty. I haven't had anything go horribly while getting an entree, in fact I love the Sesame Beef/Chicken, and the Cashew Shrimp. When we get our entrees they are big portions so there are always leftovers. 

The staff isn't the most proficient in English, but they find their way and are kind. 

TLDR: Big portions, service keeps your cup filled, tasty."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!! Environment is good as well. The service is a little slow but I was there during the dinner rush. Weird thing for me was that we did not have one assigned waitress but multiple people attending us. The general manager does walk around and engages with customers which I thought was cool."}
{"text":"We love Wongs!  Its so much better than the other Chinese food places in the west valley."}
{"text":"Tasty dishes overall, mostly basic Chinese takeout dishes. Some dishes maybe a little heavy on the salt/soy sauce. Not sure if it's msg-free, but was definitely thirsty after getting home. Would visit again when craving some Chinese food."}
{"text":"Super excited that we tried this place out! My stomach is very happy, we used the free 1/2 order crab puff for a check in and we will definitely order them next time we go. The sweet and sour chicken was not breaded too much like most places! This is definitely our new Chinese place!"}
{"text":"Great food always  great company been there a long time. Fast pick up very fast pick up!"}
{"text":"Foods food and staff sometimes makes you feel awkwardly uninvited.  A side from that the food was good and I would eat here again.  Price point was good and large portions are amazing. May have been an off day so I'm willing to try again."}
{"text":"This my favorite Chinese food in the west valley... Servers are nice. Food is good and good prices"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on Yelp and it is GREAT!!! We liked it so much that we went back the next day. We had the seafood sizzling rice soup and the salt and pepper shrimp on our first visit. We had the sweet and sour chicken on our next visit. Not only was the food great but they also provide excellent customer service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I first went to Wongs five years ago when my fiancée first told me about it. He and his family had been going there for years, and it only seemed right to see what all the hype was about!

I was blown away to say the least! The food, service & atmosphere were all great. My cup never went empty and the portion size was great for the little money spent!

If you are looking for any recommendations, here they are..
*broccoli beef
*chicken fried rice
*Chinese sausage fried rice
*crab wontons

Look for more recommendations soon! 
This is a great family style restaurant where again, the service is just as good as the food!"}
{"text":"This is our 3rd visit since we found this hidden gem recently, thanks to YELP reviewers!! Tonight, 3 of us shared crab puff appetizer, Orange Chicken & Happy Family entrees. The crab puffs are generously filled and are so flavorful! The entree portions are large and also very flavorful.  The Orange Chicken has a lil kick and the chicken was tender.  Happy family was a favorite too...The veggies weren't overcooked, nice!! The portions were large enough that we left full AND had left-overs!! The staff is always very welcoming, friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"In town for the Luke airshow and was craving chinese. We found this little gem and weren't disappointed one bit. Our waitress was very welcoming and was very helpful. We'll definitely be coming back here the next time we are in town. Most importantly the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is by far my favorite chinese food place in the pheonix area. Nice amount of food and taste is great. Everything we have tried is really good."}
{"text":"Seriously the best service in the valley and the best Chinese on the West Siiiide!  From the friendly greeting at the door to the amazingly nice staff we were treated like VIP 's.  Can't wait to return.

Was showing houses in the area and took my client out to lunch as I do for all my clients. At almost 30 he had never been to a Chinese restaurant that wasn't a buffet he told me... So I felt obligated to take him to yelp's highest rated Chinese restaurant in the area. 

Being from NJ I have had great Chinese at home and in NYC growing up. This place can hold its own with those joints. I only tried 2 dishes so far so can't wait to come back and sample the rest. (Didn't partake in the free crab puff today for yelp check ins)

Garlic chicken, asked for extra spicy. It was in a kind  of clear sauce, not the brown I was expecting ...so.... drumroll.....it was Awesome-o! Very tender chicken and great fresh garlic flavor.

Happy family. This dish has shrimp, pork, chicken and beef. Also asked for spicy. The beef was so tender i thought it resembled filet mignon. A good way to judge a Chinese restaurant is their beef.  Chicken is not sold in prime, choice etc. Neither is pork or shrimp. When a restaurant spends that extra $$ on quality beef it is very obvious from the 1st bite.

I know it's not like me to leave a review without a food pic...but it looked 2 good and I was a little too hungry to remember today.  But as the great famous Governor said...\"I'll be back\"!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Arizona and we went to Wongs every Sunday after church.  Three years ago we got stationed in Hawaii.  Everytime I come home, our first stop is Wongs.  I love everything about it.  Wongs is my comfort food."}
{"text":"Five Stars hands down. I've been coming here since I was a little girl and an unpleasant experience caused my family to avoid this place which was so hard because the food is just delicious. They are now under new management and surprisingly the new manger reached out to me in reference to my last review. He made everything great and suggested I give them another shot. 

I called in my order and the woman who took my order was very bubbly, friendly and not to mention patient because I was driving and she had trouble hearing me. My order was ready in less than 10 minutes and I was greeted upon coming in. The manager actually came and introduced himself to me and they showed me so much hospitality.

There was never an issue with the food as they are hands down serving delicious quality food, but now add great customer service on top of that and they have a life customer. I know bad experiences can't be avoided, but the way this manager handled the issue really shows such great character."}
{"text":"I am very picky about my Chinese food.... However, I can honestly say Wongs Chinese Restaurant prepares really good food and if it is not to my liking they will fix it without complaining or fussing... The service is always good,... I just wished they deliver... But the food is worth going to pick up on my own for take out..."}
{"text":"Overall we were pleased with the quality of our meal. It is amazing how different the Chinese food around this area tastes. I mean completely different flavors of the same dish from one restaurant to another. For the most part Wong's is good. I prefer the flavor of the pad Thai at a different place. But their Szechuan beef is very good.  Also they have very delicious egg rolls!  Sweet and sour chicken was the most unique I've ever had it prepared.  Flavor was great but when you cut into it all the breading comes off."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Chinese food and just moved to this area, we wanted to try something local and chose this place as it had the better reviews and closest. When I called to order, the lady was verrry nice and personable. We picked up and food was ready when they said it would be, everything was correct and food was amazing!! We actually liked this place more then our precious one we went to near our old house. We will be a regular going forward."}
{"text":"Ok these people who gave them over one star have never had decent chinese food.My family was sick for the holidays and couldnt cook so we thought we might try this chinese eatery near us.

The food is flavorless and overcooked.The spare ribs and chicken wings were spongy and soft.I think BBQ ribs and chicken wings are supposed to be crispy or am I \"wong\"?The fried rice was bland as was the whatever chicken, pork ,shrimp veggeie dish we got.That was covered in a tasteless goo that made it all the same insipid flavor.As if that wasnt bad enough we all got violent diarrhea,all of us that ate the food.Did I mention we were already sick?

I would avoid this place like a plague.Even Panda express is a step up quality wise.

FYI.....we usually go to King Wong for our Chinese since its near work but it was too far from home.King Wong is scary { not some fancy facade or interior } but the food is at least good ,not great and we never got sick.And they make the dark brown rice we from the east coast like, to order."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese places in all the Phoenix. I eat Chinese food on a regular basis and find this is my go to place when I have family and friends come to visit"}
{"text":"No stars
Very disappointed, food got us sick and to no avail owner felt it wasn't his food. Well it was the only food we ate. We ended up vomiting and spending a great deal of time in the bathroom with bad cramping and diarrhea. Still not feeling well yet and ended up going to Doctor and getting antibiotic. Patrons beware as one of the other patrons was told don't eat the leftovers From a staff member, a bit concerning. I wish I would of read there review. New management is just not doing it.
No compassion and understanding by owner. Felt customer wrong. Did say sorry but can't do anything.
Bad PR
Sick and disappointed of how to handle your business
I give you 0 stars"}
{"text":"The food was very very delicious!!! The staff is awesome!!! Our water was continously refilled! We definitely found our new Asian food spot."}
{"text":"We just moved here from California and wanted some Chinese food to settle us in.  We were delighted with our choice.  Wonderful service from the most friendly staff I've ever seen.  They treat you like family.  Emperors chicken was da bomb.  We'll definitely be back.  Welcome to Arizona in style."}
{"text":"Now I am from the Chicago and I have been looking for a great Chinese food place, so I read the reviews and decided to try it out.  Not what I was expecting.  I wanted to like the place so bad but the food was just ok.  I ordered Happy Family and Shrimp Fried Rice.  The rice was over cooked and gummy. The Happy Family was over cooked. I tried it and was just not good.  There egg rolls were good though, just wish that they had shrimp in them."}
{"text":"Food was Better thank expected, great service. This is going to be my to go Chinese food place from now on. We ordered pork fried rice, beef lo mein, Mongolian beef, and another chicken dish all so good! Not to mention the best egg rolls, and crab puffs and an Awesome mango tea."}
{"text":"Time for a quick update the location has been sold the new owners much younger much hipper have started to do some necessary improvements. So far the only negative I have found was a few food items have changed their tastes or their flavor. For instance I noticed the egg rolls no longer taste the same. The staff for the most part remains the same, service is still excellent and aside from some creepy guy that is always in the back corner on his computer who seems 100% out of place in the fact that he is always there and the only non-Asian other than customers, again creepy, the restaurant and its location are excellent."}
{"text":"-The owner (man) was VERY friendly.

-Some Chinese Woman (the owner's wife?)...NOT friendly! She gave me the impression that I was bothering her for coming in to eat there! There were like 3 or 4 other tables in the whole place.

-The Food: Not so great...the chicken was mostly small almost chopped chicken chunks...dry too, maybe from overcooking?

-Flavor: Ick! I didn't care for the food, thought it was bland.

-Beef dish, not much beef...mostly veggies vs the meat ratio...$8.95. Not a good value.

-I said \"thank-you\", as I left...the Chinese Woman looked at me and said nothing, then she walked away....nice!

-Parking is convenient.

-With the un-friendly Chinese Woman and not so great food, there are many other Chinese restaurants that I would select over Wongs."}
{"text":"If you are like me and look at reviews prior to visiting a new establishment, know this.... These reviews are exactly what you need to determine this is one of the best places for Chinese in the Valley! I ordered multiple items off their menu and unlike other places, every single item I ordered exceeded my expectations substantially. I am sure anything ordered from here will leave you saving their phone number in your phone for future orders. They are very friendly and their courtesy seems genuine rather than scripted like major chains we all know. You can tell there is a sense of pride in their craft and it shows through the quality of both their food and service"}
{"text":"We ordered two services of chicken and shrimp and they refused to give us two sides of steamed rice instead argued that they gave us a large order of white rice... spent $30 and we can only get one order of steam rice, never going back, cheap management."}
{"text":"We found our new favorite Chinese restaurant on the west side of town! I was craving good orange chicken and orange beef and we were so impressed. First, the customer service was amazing. I went in to look at their menu and they were so helpful. They didn't try to make me order more food just for business, they asked me questions to help guide me what to order. They gave me delicious hot oolong tea while I waited. They were very busy with dine in and take out orders and it was very clean inside. Portions are huge!!! We also added an order of wongs fried rice( fried rice with pork,chicken and beef) and you get a whole take out box of it! They also have really good hot Chinese mustard. We will definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"amazing and authentic food  !!!!!!! very family oriented! great service ! amazing food! very traditional!!! will definitely return to here ! you get so much stuff and so much food for a low price !"}
{"text":"I love this place everything I have tried here I like. Almost everything here is the same price about $6.50 per meal. Great place to take a family or business partners. I love the colorful personality's of the staff. The items marked as hot are hot! yeah! my favorite is the Kung Pow chicken (makes my nose run and eyes water on occasion)"}
{"text":"It was delicious and the service was amazing. We had many people checking on us throughout the meal and our glasses were never empty.  I was also amazed by the cleanliness of the restaurant. 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Legit Chinese food in the west valley. 

Most definitely above average, as they bring a unique style to some of their dishes. They understand you can make good Chinese without deep frying everything in tons of batter and putting tons of sugar in. My sesame chicken and fried rice were surprisingly light and savory. More importantly, I didn't feel like passing out for like 12 hours after finishing it. The honey walnut shrimp (the proper name of which escapes me) was freaking delicious.

Of course, they seem to have less common items as well. Their special when I was there was a flounder in black bean sauce dish. Not something I've seen before, so I may have to give it a try! The menu really is pretty expansive with lots of the classics, as well as affordable lunch specials.

Other nifty aspects of Wong's are the really cool interior. It looks so fancy you'll feel the need to tuck in your shirt! Lots of room, and it's great for big groups. They're Yelp friendly as well, and serve up a groovy check-in deal. This is good stuff, and I'm happy to see something like it in the Avondale area."}
{"text":"My family absolutely LOVES this place, its easy to say we are addicted. I am a vegan and they're tofu and vegetable soup (order it with veggie broth) and mixed vegetable plate.... sooooooooo good!!!!! Exceedingly friendly staff and quick service! Absolutely the best Chinese food in town!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I had the orange chicken, emperors chicken and the shrimp lo mein. Everything was delicious! Food comes in good size plates. This place is great for take out or for sharing with friends."}
{"text":"Good food and the service was great.  If you're staying around the Westgate Entertainment District, it's not too far if a drive.   Better value than the restaurants at Westgate, friendly people, and it's quiet.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not great, but for Phoenix not bad is pretty good for Chinese food. 

We got the \"add on\" egg roll, wonton soup and cheese puffs. 

All were very good. Ordered beef chow fun and the cashew chicken. 

I think they use MSG in the meat, because the beef had a bit of a funny texture to it while chewing. 

Large enough portions for leftovers to take out. 

Nice enough restaurant with white tablecloths. Nice touch. 

In the Valley, this is one of the better Chinese places you're going to get."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Wong's for 27 years.  There have been a few different owners, but the quality has been consistent all these years."}
{"text":"This place was great! The staff was very friendly and had a great atmosphere. Big potions and very tasty food. We got the Orange Chicken which was yummy and the Emperor's Chicken which was great too. We git a free 1/2 order of Crab puffs. My boys loved them. We would definitely go back there again"}
{"text":"I come here alot but haven't yelp it. So just so you all know ,its one of the best Chinese food hole in the wall joints to come to!!. Its so worth it."}
{"text":"On this particular night we were jonesing for some \"good\" Chinese dinner. This was the closest Chinese restaurant to our particular location, I should have kept looking. Take out dinner for four cost $60... $60! We got a subpar cashew chicken, two soggy orange chickens and overcooked shrimp in lobster sauce. Not only was the food not good and overpriced but they also forgot our rice. I have had very good Chinese food for a lot less money, I guess I'll just have too keep searching. I know some have had a good experience at this Chinese food restaurant and I am happy for them, I can only speak for my own personal experience. I don't know if I'll completely write this place off just yet since I haven't tried my old fall back, Kung pow shrimp. But I'll tell you this, give me a bad Kung pow shrimp and you are dead to me!"}
{"text":"Best moo Shu Pork in Phoenix!! Also the oyster beef is very good. Everyone is friendly, so we will be back"}

{"text":"We were not disappointed with Wong's food was amazing and the lunch specials are great...."}
{"text":"WOW! For 10 years I've been searching for a good Chinese place, like back east, and every time they are just\"ok\"!!!! I have finally found \"IT\"! This place was phenomenal! The wonton soup and egg rolls were good. Their crab puffs are soooo good! My hubby had the Chicken Lo Mein and it was wonderful. Tons of flavor! I had the Curry chicken and damn it was amazing! My son had the orange chicken and that was really good also. 

The staff are all super nice also. When  any of the waitresses walked by they ALL asked how things were, refilled drinks and took empty plates. The service was fantastic! 

I have found my spot!!!! We will for sure be back often!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. It's a bit of a drive for us, but it's well worth it. The prices are average, the food is the best Chinese food that I have found in the Valley."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Wong's Chinese Cuisine. The staff was very friendly and the ambiance was pleasant. I ordered food to go.

Their hot and sour soup was my favorite part of the meal. The orange chicken was moist and delicious. I only wish it had been slightly hotter. I wanted sauteed mixed veggies but they were not good at all- they didn't taste sauteed they were over-cooked and entirely too soft and mushy. I wound up throwing them away as I did with their lo-mein noodle dish also. 

Yes, I would go back and try different items if I were in that part of town again. They have ample parking. I'm on a mission to find a really great Chinese food restaurant here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Since our move to the south west valley, my family had been looking for a good chinese restaurant.  I found this restaurant from yelp and other sites and true to form...the reviews pretty much sum up wongs on indian school.  Located on the north side of indian school across from the chase bank..in a dainty strip mall...it sits next door to an unknown bookstore with the most inconsistant store close times...sometimes its open....other times...nope.  anyway.....as you walk into wongs, there is a front table with a  register and an older asian lady that looks very judgemental...the truth of the matter is..she probably is...but who cares, im there to eat!  My family and i go at least once every week or two.  We usually have the chinese eggplant with beef special and my kids devour the lemon chicken.  I once tried the spicy beef with mushrooms...delicious.  i also had experimented with the chicken corn soup....delicious.  you cant really go wong with wongs..give it a try!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while passing through. Service and food was amazing. Sadly we live out of state."}
{"text":"Super good. We enjoy it because it seems \"traditional\" to us. Great service and we have been back a few times. Definitely some of the best Chinese on West Side."}
{"text":"Took the family here and got the family meal that's $12 a person. We were informed it has new owners. The pepper beef was ok, too much peppers and onions. Bell peppers aren't cooked very much in any of the dishes, so if you don't like raw bell pepper, not preferable. The egg roll and wing you get are very good. The wing is a flavor I've never had. The hot and sour soup is very very good. I will return for just the soup for sure. We loved the Emperor Chicken and Orange Shrimp. The Kung Pow chicken is decent, I should have ordered it hotter, and again the bell peppers were vary lightly cooked. We will be eating here again. Guess that's the biggest point."}
{"text":"The best blace for Chinese food you must experience this place.  Hard working attentive employees make this place very successful. They are extremely polite and you will not have to wait for anything they are they for you and they show it."}
{"text":"If I could give a minus 0 I would these are the rudest owners they make Anna the old owner look pleasant service was awful the soup and appetizers came at same time  and one hour later never got our food I would never go back and the food is not special or good enough to overcome the crappy service and rude owners try anywhere but here"}
{"text":"The last time I came here was years ago when we first moved to the valley. It wasn't a great experience however over time we gave this place a try once again. Glad we did because my husband enjoyed every bit of the food however we wish the helping on the noodles were more. Just a hand full that was just enough for him. Overall the service is great and the food is good. We came hoping to order a peaking duck which is still on their menu but it's discontinued."}
{"text":"Very impressed. Really good food, generous portions, and super nice staff, very accommodating. The sweet and sour tofu was excellent. This is definitely a place we will keep on our steady rotation for dining out too."}
{"text":"My family has made this our one and only chinese restaurant since we moved to AZ. We wouldn't think of going anywhere else. The servers know us now and we feel like they are a part of our family. The food is fantastic and the prices are more than reasonable. It's a large dining room yet even when it's full we get our food super quickly. Wong's has us for life."}
{"text":"Really good quality Chinese food and the staff is super friendly!

Their pieces are reasonable considering the plate sizes are humongous. 

Inside is super cute, almost looks like formal dining but it's not."}
{"text":"They are family orientated, come fancy or in shorts. Table cloths on all table. Very clean. Portions can feed 2 people easily. They make the best Orange Chicken."}
{"text":"Very friendly place! The food was very good and we ordered a bunch. Ordered Family style BBQ Pork, Lemon Chicken, Orange Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Cashew Chicken and white rice came with it. Had endless ice tea and soda drinks for three. Have lunch for one left for tomorrow too all for $53.00 plus tip We will be back for sure. Would have taken photos but didn't remember till after we ate..oops!"}
{"text":"First time customer with my dad today.  Service was excellent and timely, food was delicious fresh and hot.  The price point was great for someone like me that eats out allot.  I live close and will definitely be back for lunch."}
{"text":"We have been eating here for about 4 years and I have honestly never had a bad experience whether dining in or taking food to go.  I'll admit that I'm very much a creature of habit. I'll usually get the same thing. My husband, however, has tried different dishes and I've enjoyed those as well.  

Dine in experience is always pleasant and service is great.  This is the happiest we've been since we don't have the Chinatown from home to enjoy."}
{"text":"I hadn't had Chinese food in forever and a day.  After reading my Yelp friend Rick R's review, I knew that I would have to try this spot out.  I woke up Sunday and decided that I would head on down.  I parked out front, walked in, was seated at a table and placed my order.  I went with a cup of Won Ton Soup, an order of Egg Rolls (Free with Yelp check-in!  Score!), and an order of Orange Chicken.  I also ordered some Fried Rice.  Here is how everything was.............

Won Ton Soup-  This was only $1.50 a cup.  It had 2 won tons in it and a nice amount of green onions.  The flavor of this soup was good. The temperature though, was not.  The broth wasn't really hot and just kind of warm.  The won tons were good though..nice and soft and chewy.  If this soup would have been a little bit hotter in temperature, it would have been excellent.  

Egg Rolls-  What?  Free with Yelp check-in?  Yup!  Super stoked on that!  These things came out and they were massive!  Possibly the biggest egg rolls I have ever seen.  They are served with a sweet and sour dipping sauce.  The egg rolls were great!  Piping hot, fried perfectly, and stuffed with the usual egg roll ingredients.  These were really good and I would order them again even if they weren't free.  

Orange Chicken-  Orange chicken is usually a good \"test\" item.  If a place can make a decent/good orange chicken, their other dishes are usually pretty solid.  Happy to say, Wong's makes a really good orange chicken.  The batter is a bit different than most places I have had it at before.  It's a lighter batter, with a different texture.  Almost like a panko encrusted chicken. The sauce they use is sweet but not overpowering.  The pieces of chicken were cut thin too, and they absorbed all the sauce rather well.  I would definitely get this again.  It was even better heated up later on that night for seconds! 

Fried Rice-  I saw on the menu that a plain order of fried rice was only $3.00.  I thought that's what I was ordering.  Turns out, I was never charged for fried rice.  They included it as my rice side for my orange chicken!  Score!  The plain fried rice was very plain..just rice that had been fried pretty quick.  No veggies, no egg etc.  It was decent.  I have had better fried rice elsewhere, but the fact that it was included in my meal for no extra charge, gets bonus points on my end ;-).

Overall, I had a very good meal here!  Like I said with the chicken, I actually enjoyed my leftovers just as much as eating it there in the restaurant. I pretty much made 2 full meals for around $13.00. The portions were very big!  Also, the 2 ladies that waited on me were incredibly kind.  The main lady (cashier? owner?) was very friendly and asked me where I came from, how I heard about the Yelp check-in etc.  Very personable and made you feel at home!  I now know where to get good Chinese food in the West Valley!  I'm sure I will be back to try out some other dishes soon enough!"}
{"text":"While on a road trip to Sedona it was past dinner time and we were getting hungry, so I checked Yelp to find a place to eat that wasn't your typical fast food choices. Wongs had 4 stars and enough reviews that I decided to give it a try. When we pulled up in front my first impression was that it doesn't look like much from the outside. When we entered I was quite surprised to find how large it was inside. Very traditional Chinese style decor with even 2 levels of dining.  The restaurant was dated, but clean (including the bathrooms) Our server was very friendly and brought hot tea and water.  I ordered the Chicken with Broccoli in brown sauce. It was good, but not great.  We also ordered the Vegetable Fried Rice which was also good. My husband enjoyed the Kung Pao Chicken.  If you are a big eater, you will love the large portions. There was enough leftover food for 2 more meals. Would I go out of my way to eat here? Probably not, but for me, much better than a fast food chain. Very standard Chinese food."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from here last night, the food was good, but we ordered egg rolls and they forgot to include them with the order even though they charged us for them. We called and the remedied the issue by sending someone to come deliver them to us. So in the end good food and they remedied the mistake."}
{"text":"Clean place with wonderful food 
Everything on the menu is amazing and even my kids have tried several  different plates and love every single one of them 
It's good on price and the food comes out fast 
The egg rolls r the best"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot when I crave Chinese food. Excellent Chinese food great flavor."}
{"text":"One of my secret spots.  My favorite dish is Kang Pao chicken. Every dish I've had is always  very tasty and most importantly fresh. The chicken is amazingly fresh and never tastes old, chewy or low quality. Everyone I've introduced to this place immediately compliments its freshness. In addition the prices are competitive and best deals are lunch and dinner specials. For freshness and tastiness you will never go wrong. 

From the outside you might overlook the restaurant since the entrance is tucked in the middle of the shopping center. Once inside you are surprised with its size and plenty of seating with an almost upscale looking place. Temperature is always comfortable unlike other Chinese places I've been accustomed too. If you decide to show up with a large group there is huge circular table  making your meal a social experiment. 

Fresh is the word I would use to describe it and will continue to be my favorite Chinese food joint."}
{"text":"I've been looking for the closest thing to NY/NJ style Chinese food in the valley and I think this is one (of the two) closest to it that I've had so far and thus the 5 star rating. It isn't chinese from NY/NJ but it's my favorite one tied with Maxim Restaurant (19th Ave & Osborne)... since I live in the west valley, I will be coming back to Wong's more often! 

Started with a welcoming greet from the server and I ordered crab puffs (half order),  cup of dumpling soup, and the emperor's chicken. The crab puff were large, seemed like each piece had a tablespoon of cream cheese filling with which you can taste the slight crunch of shell, scallion, and minced onion and carrot. My fave crab puff in the valley lol. The dumpling soup was also really good. Balanced flavor. Now, when the emperor's chicken arrived, it came with plentiful of rice and was delicious! My cup or water was always tended to and never reached empty. I recommend for others to try this place. I for sure will be coming back for their fast and friendly service, and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Very delicious!!!! I truly judge a place by their egg rolls and by golly this place has the best egg rolls I've ever tasted lol.  Had the shrimp Lo mein, egg foo young with white rice. The portions are pretty big too!  Treated my daughter out and had plenty of left overs!!!  We both love it!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday.  Food was really good and staff is so plesent there.  They did make a mistake in my order, but guickly and plesently,  rectified it.  I can't wait to go back and try something different.   ( I ordered #307, seafood, something), yum!"}
{"text":"Very good flavor and attentive staff! My wife and I had a couple of our favorite dishes and were pleased with the taste. Our water glasses were filled multiple times by the waitresses.

The hostess was very personable and stopped by the table a couple times. 

The portion size was good for the price and entres came with a pot with rice for the table to share.

Overall, great dining experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"We visited Arizona last weekend and stopped by this place as we were craving Chinese food. We were seated right away and felt very welcomed. This restaurant has the friendliest staff, the food was just as good. We ordered the hot and sour soup, chicken lo mein, shrimp chow mein, and orange chicken. Everything tasted great and we were all very satisfied with the food and service. Will definitely be coming here on our next trip to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Wong's for over 15 years. The quality of the food has always consistently exceeded my standards and the prices have remained fair for the portions and quality of the food. My only complaint, that is only one Wong's! I'm from Las Vegas where I am inundated with quality food from around the world and yet even in such circumstances I cannot find a Chinese food place that rivals the taste, quality, prices or family run atmosphere. It's rather pleasant to see the same people anytime I stop by to eat. My best regards to the Wong's family that runs the restaurant with such evident care and attention. I'll be a happy customer for life!"}
{"text":"Food is great and authentic. Not to mention that the customer service is great !!! You will NOT be disappointed"}
{"text":"I moved from California to Arizona over a year ago .. and have to say I missed China town dearly for their food .. but not no more this place is as close as to China town I will get and loved it ! The service was good and the food super tasting ! Can't wait to eat here again .."}
{"text":"Came due to good reviews but the food was not good. Not sure what kind of rice was served. It was brown but not necessarily brown rice. Egg flower soup was tasteless and I asked for sriracha and they didn't have any. Not sure why they had so many good reviews."}
{"text":"Awesome! Love the Orange chicken and their green tea!
Portion sizes are huge....plenty to take home."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. We got orange chicken, crab puffs, and vegetable lo mein. Food was fresh and hot when we picked it up, the girl working the counter was very nice and friendly even walked my drinks out while I was putting the food in the car. 30 minutes before it closed and it looked full of customers in the dining area still which is always a good sign. I would definitely recommend. My only complaint is they don't deliver haha

Update: 02/15/17
Literally the best Chinese food in town since the Chen wok on 35th and thunderbird closed down.
Still bummed no delivery but they are so good, fast, friendly that I can drive down the street to pick up lunch with a smile on my face."}
{"text":"We waited forever and food didn't come.  We sat in front of our empty plates while seeing the food go to all the other tables.  Decided to leave..."}
{"text":"Wong's service some of the best Chinese food I've had in the valley. My wife loves their garlic chicken while I've tried many dishes and enjoyed everything I've had. Their sizzling rice soup is a bit lighter than some other places but still serves 2 as an appetizer. 

The prices have gone up over the years but are still not overboard. I agree with others saying that the water can be, at times dusty. But I usually drink the tea with dinner anyway.

Wong's is never backed up out the door so you can get in any day, even on Valentine's which has turned into a silly tradition with me and the wife. And the service is always friendly.

Overall I think 4 stars fits the bill. Not \"You have to go\" but definitely pretty darned good."}
{"text":"My new favorite place. Top to bottom from service to the food. Everything I have tried has been delicious. Definitely going to be my go to spot for their cuisine"}
{"text":"This is a place that deserves a review. Wowzers!
Great flavors, textures, no nasty bits and large amounts of food. 
I can die a happy woman!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time. Service is good, very sweet and polite. Ordered egg drop soup delicious, egg rolls.. I gotta be honest I rarely like egg rolls from most places because there's always something that I don't like, these on the other hand are good, along with the crab puffs. Ordered Mongolian beef, Wong chow mein, all delicious! It's really hard to find that old school Chinese food and this is where it's at... Definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ice cold water egg drop soup and fried rice are all amazing. Egg rolls are incredible. The sauce is great."}
{"text":"My family and I are from California and haven't found a Chinese food place that compares to what we're used to having in California until now. This is the best Chinese food we have tasted. We love the orange chicken and the egg rolls. We also had the wonton soup, bbq ribs, shrimp lomain, and pepper beef everything was delicious. The portions are perfect to have enough leftover to have a second meal."}
{"text":"We had tomato beef Cantonese noodles, moo shu beef crepes and lo mien chicken, crab puffs. All very fresh and delicious !"}
