{"text":"Just got back from an excellent dinner.   We were a little ambitious and ordered three sushi roll plates. The Veggie Dragon roll had shiitake mushrooms and sweet potato - excellent and unique. Salmon Tempurah roll and Scallop Roll were also a step above what I have had elsewhere in the City. Veggie Tempurah was also delicious with a very light batter.   This is an odd comment, but even the pickled ginger was a cut above - had way more flavour than I am used to. Presentation of all of the rolls was excellent and the serving sizes were very generous. Service was friendly and efficient.  This place is a big step up from its predecessor (District) and prices are very reasonable given the quality. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto and this restaurant is close to where we stayed. We wanted Toro and Amaebi from their menu, but they didn't have them. So we ordered 24-piece sashimi. But it came out warm. Should be a bit chilled to achieve the best taste. We suspected that the fish was not fresh because they tasted weird. And later when we got back to the hotel, we both had diarrhea. We eat sashimi all the time and this seldom happened to us. Worst experience ever. Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"I picked up takeaway from here for the first time last night and it was really very good. Everything was fresh, made with good ingredients, well put together and made to order. We had; gyoza dumplings, vegetable tempura, spicy tuna rolls and tempura California rolls. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I'll qualify this review in advance by saying that I've only ever tried sushi twice before. Once at a renowned sushi joint at Yonge/Finch, and once in an Irish college cafeteria. (The latter was pre-packaged, vegetarian, and, as I discovered after eating it, two weeks past its best by date. I hadn't even noticed.) I probably wouldn't know truly authentic, top-notch sushi if the fish came to life and slapped me in the face. Similarly, unless the stuff was rotting before my eyes, I probably couldn't tell you much about bad sushi, either.  I may be no expert, but I for sure know when I love a meal. I also know when I'm blown away by the quality of the ingredients served, the freshness of everything on my plate, the stunning flavours of every aspect of my dish and the visual appeal of the food in front of me.  Mazz Bistro was as good a meal as I ever had.  I ordered the salmon tempurah as a premium roll and the spicy tuna roll as a regular roll. Both were indescribably delicious. The avocado in the salmon roll in particular stood out. It may seem like an odd ingredient to single out, but I have never tasted any avocado as fresh and satisfying as this. The salmon was exquisite, and the tuna was thick in texture and perfectly spiced, as per it's description. The accompanying wasabi and chilli sauces were both fabulous, and came in just the right amounts on the plate. I honestly didn't want this meal to end! My boyfriend had unagi and Golden Dragon roll and he felt the same way I did about the quality of the food. He already can't wait to go back.  The visual presentation of the food was stunning; as good as you'd ever see. Our waitress was so sweet, welcoming and helpful - a joy to deal with. The interior of the restaurant is classy and appears upmarket, yet was very cosy and comfortable with the sofa seats.    Upon looking at the menu from outside the prices look pretty standard. After having actually eaten in the restaurant, however, I can safely say that this place is excellent, excellent value. I'm glad I ordered the regular sized spicy tuna roll as it was so delicious, however, in terms of feeling full after having eaten, I could have easily just ordered any premium roll (11.95/12.95) and that would have more than sufficed. There's not many places in the area where a main course will only set you back 11/12 dollars - and certainly not many places offering such wonderful food and service as Mazz Bistro for that price.  We will definitely be back. A wonderful experience. Interesting that most other diners in the restaurant were Japanese at the time we visited - that says a lot about the quality here. I'm kicking myself that I live two seconds away and it's taken me ten months to come here.  (I'm not even annoyed at the fact that they don't serve espresso. That says it all.)"}
{"text":"Definitely recommended - generous portions, great quality food, attentive service, etc. This place is often overlooked as Tabule is next door but it truly deserves props and more patronage."}
{"text":"Good range of japanese food, well-prepared, reasonable prices, and friendly and accommodating service.  The decor is funky and warm, and they also do take out.  They recently opened a back patio but I haven't tried that yet."}
{"text":"Amazing! Such a unique menu and lots of tasty food with beautiful presentation. Staff are always super friendly and helpful too! Try the spicy salmon nachos, they are the bomb dot com"}
{"text":"Best place for sushi in Riverside! Beautiful backyard patio and very friendly staff. Highly recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Supermarket maki with low quality fish, too ripe avocado, bring a knur for the lobster and else, nothing to compare with district bistrot was on  same location"}
{"text":"Very good Japanese sushi \"bistro\"!...seeing groups of Japanese people thoroughly enjoying themselves is a great sign of authentic flavour and quality!..."}
{"text":"Great little sushi restaurant that my sister and I stumbled upon. The decor is upscale and classy, as is the music. However, we were surprised that two could have a full sushi dinner for $40. The quality is good at that price point and the table service to match. Definitely go on weekdays if you want a cozy and intimate dinner with the whore restaurant to yourself."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*  We stopped in the other night.  The staff here is  super nice and accommodating.  There are few things on the menu that are unique (and we had to try).   We ordered the spicy salmon nachos, veggie tempura, and a sushi platter.  The veggie tempura was good, but not quite as deep fried as the sushi restaurant that used to be here, but still good.  The spicy salmon nachos was good.  Interesting.  The next time I order it, I'll probably eat it as a salad.  The assembly process, was...well a process.  I tend to like my food pre-assembled, which is why I'm not a huge fan of fajitas (at any establishment).  The sushi was good, but I have sushi goggles on, because I haven't had it in months.  It's still a nice place and worth the visit.  And as Jessica M mentioned, they do serve fried spaghetti sticks, which are quite tasty."}
{"text":"It's totally decent sushi.   A clear step up from the place that used to be here.  Nothing mind-blowing spectacular.   But nothing terribly horrible.  A totally safe bet if you're already in the neighbourhood.  Relatively inexpensive drinks, and free fried spaghetti to start."}
{"text":"Honestly, not even for the money, the food here is just amazing. Very high standards, family run, simply awesome. You can always tell a good sushi place by their sashimi. Is it fresh? And this place takes the prize! Go!"}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery and I must say very impressed.  We had Nigiri (Salmon, Tuna, Eel, Yellowtail), Karaage, Sushi pizza, tempura, and Spicy Tuna Roll. Mazz gave us one of their Tornado Potatoes to try - VERY NICE!  overall, Tempura was excellent, light batter. Sushi was excellent especially the Himachi and Tuna. Karaage was good but not enough chicken (was more like popcorn chicken).  Really happy with the order... will support this restaurant for sure... will try other Sushi options next time."}
