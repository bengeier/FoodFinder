{"text":"Took my son for a birthday lunch, food was incredible. service was great, it was great seeing Mark again. we will be back. thanks Mark for stopping by our table. we will definitely be back.  This restaurant will definitely be one of our favorite places."}
{"text":"Great new local establishment.  Had the stuffed banana pepper sub, excellent.   My son had the pulled pork and said it was one of best he's had.  Slaw was excellent as well.  Apps came fast.  Chips were very good, maybe a little season salt on the table would be nice.   Scotch eggs with Yum  yum sauce were great.  Server was attentive and owner stopped by to check on the meal.  All in all, a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"We waited forever for our food. 30 minutes for a cheeseburger and a cobb salad is a little much. The food isn't worth a 30 minute wait by any means. The cheeseburger finally arrived and of course it's not plain as requested, so back it went. A refill on your soda and water is also nice to have. The waitress went past us numerous times and never even checked. The chips are good and would have been nice to nibble on during that 30 minute wait for our food, but unfortunately, they were brought out with our food. 
I think the wait staff either needs training or maybe hire a few with experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I arrived at Bobby D's around 1030 last night. We had been there several times for happy hours, but usually not late night. We were looking for some good food other than fast food at that hour. We sat down in the dining area and there was obviously a party going on, DJ, dancing, a lot of fun amongst the crowd. We sat for about 15 minutes and were not waited on. This didn't bother us too much because we saw only one waitress handling a table of 20 and we both understood that could be overwhelming with the dancing party too. Soon a man came up to us and asked if we were taken care of. We said no, and he said he could assist us. We asked about the kitchen and he said it closed at 1030. Understanding we showed up at that time, we didn't push the issue of food and decided on 2 drinks instead. The man insisted he could help us with getting us something to eat and it wouldn't be a problem. Grateful we accepted his offer of their homemade chicken salad sliders. After only a few minutes we had our drinks and the man brought out our food and we thanked him for accommodating us, he noted he was the owner and that it wasn't a problem. The waitress then took our table over. Both the owner and the waitress were very kind and attentive. Fun, great atmosphere, where you can bring your buddies for a few drinks, come watch the game, or sit quietly in a booth if that's what you're into. I've liked this place before and will absolutely continue to recommend it due to the service we received last night."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner the food was awesome and service was fantastic. My suggestion to anyone going is to take some ear protection because the noise is unreal. We started for a drink in the bar where the regulars didn't have normal conversation they yelled at each other. The bartenders need to take the RAMP Program and if they did already they need a refresher. We moved for dinner to the restaurant side which wasn't any better. There were 4 of us and we kind of just looked at each other because you couldn't hold a conversation. 
Only downside of the place is the almost unbearable noise, not sure how anybody works in that place and doesn't constantly have a headache."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a 5 star review, but it just wasn't to be.
Everything is shiny and new, plenty of TV's for your viewing pleasure.
The service was as expected for a place just open a few days.
The kitchen was slow, really slow. 40 min before we got our French onion soup.  Which no one could eat because it was disgustingly salty. Another 20 min later, the rest of our food came and two of the three orders were wrong. Fries instead of chips and cheese on the chicken sandwich. The wings (the only order right) were again disgusting salty went back. The chicken sandwich (which they did remake) ended up being awful as well. Oh and I never did get my chips, so can't say how good they are (but were probably too salty). 
They did comp the food we didn't eat, but the bill was above average for the area. 
The Reuben was good (not great). 

They did try to make up for it, but honestly we just wanted to leave, so we could go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great menu, staff and owner! The food was outstanding and it's clear there's a lot of passion behind it. Our youngest who never finishes anything loved the chips and ate almost his entire burger. He also loved the fresh cut fries. We tried the Brisket nachos, Mac and cheese (daughter said it was the best she's had) stuffed pepper hoagie and pulled pork. Everything was very good. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"New as of March of this year -  Trivia nights on Wednesdays.  I enjoyed relaxing at the bar and playing the jukebox last night!   I placed a \"to go\" order..  the  southwestern egg rolls - never disappoint and tried the mac and cheese (with bacon) for the first time last night.."}
{"text":"Ordered the brisket burger and upcharged to load it up. The burger was awesome, brisket very good, the fried chicken breast (yes added to sandwich for just 2 bucks) was good but a bit overly crisp, and the other toppings were delicious. The waitress said it was the biggest sandwich she saw there, and it didn't disappoint. I was especially impressed with the fried green tomatoes. Only gripe was my water was never filled up during the entire meal and we went while there were only about 7 tables in use."}
{"text":"We ate at Bobby D's on Saturday night at about 8:00 p.m. and the restaurant side was very empty but the bar side was packed with very loud people. It was so loud that it made our dinner unpleasant. My husband had a hamburger and said it was delicious, we had 6 BBQ chicken wings and we tried to eat quickly so we could leave since the noise level was uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the fried green tomatoes. I didn't care for the ribs. I was truly disappointed!! They were not that tender fat not all cooked. The bbq sauce had a strang but not good flavor and they were swimming in it. Service was good though."}
{"text":"Kennedy Township needed a restaurant like Bobby D's! Perfect place to grab a quick, quality bite to eat. I ate the best steak salad I've had in a long time! We sat in the bar area and had great service, but we will definitely try the regular dining room next time! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great little place.  Didn't exactly know where it was since it sits atop the hill in a plaza and their name isn't on the marquee currently. Please consider getting this done ASAP for people not familiar with the area.  Wasn't busy in the dining area when we got there (around 5 pm), but once we were served, people started coming in; so I'm guessing they get a pretty good crowd.

I had the mac 'n cheese skillet with shrimp added in.  What an excellent choice. Large portion served piping hot in a cast iron skillet.  Also tried the Pixie Stick drink.  Very sweet just like the candy; but still good.  Husband tried the ribs.  Good, but neither of us were a huge fan of the sauce;  too spicey/peppery for us, but that's just our taste buds."}
{"text":"If you want a place that has a unique and delicious menu, this is the place. I have been here twice since it has opened, and the food hit the mark both times. Appetizer wise, I highly recommend the fried pickles. The brisket nachos and chips are yummy too, though:)  If you are looking for something with a little kick, the hot stuffed pepper hoagie is a perfect choice. It is served on a fresh Mancini's bun with 2 overly stuffed hot peppers.  DELICIOUS! If you want something a  little lighter, the steak or salmon salad is a great choice. Both are served on a bed of mixed greens (not iceberg lettuce.), and the meat on both is cooked to preference. Besides the food, the atmosphere is fantastic. There are TVs in the bar and restaurant area, so you can watch whatever sporting event is playing at the moment. Also, the owner visits each table and spends a minute chatting with you. Bobby D's is a wonderful addition to the restaurant choices in Kennedy Township as well as surrounding areas. Stop by! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So, I came here and my first impression when I walked in.. what a nice bar! When I sat down, everything changed. I was barely noticed and the bartender spoke to me in a condescending matter. Drinks are nice. They also have really delicious fried pickles. Very loud in this bar as well. Probably won't go back here."}
{"text":"Great food, AWESOME stuffed banana pepper hoagie.  Service was great and the owner stopped and Thanked us for coming.  Definitely a place to come back to"}
{"text":"This is a great place with great food.  The macaroni & cheese is to die for... it spoiled me eating other's version of mac & cheese... It is worth every calorie it has! All of the smoked food is excellent as well.. I've eaten here many times and each dish is my favorite... well the Mac & Cheese is on the top..  

Try it... it just might become your favorite spot for good food..."}
{"text":"The Biggest and Best Fish Sandwichs in Pittsburgh...and awsome happy hours"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my sister last night for a late dinner. We each ordered a burger with fries. I ordered the four alarm burger which has BBQ sauce, bacon, cheese and French fried onions on a larger burger. I ordered mine medium well. While the burger was good, it was a little dry in my opinion compared to other popular burger joints in the city. The fries were great and their ranch was good as well (Im in love with ranch and judge it everywhere lol) I should have asked for more bbq sauce to make up for the dry burger. 

Again it wasn't bad, but I've had better burgers.

Service was nice and the restaurant is cute."}
{"text":"What a great place with incredible food!  Gluten free friendly!!!  Owner came right out to make sure the kitchen understood our needs, great dude."}
{"text":"I've been here twice since opening and have zero regrets. Our first trip we had the fried green tomatoes and pickles. My girlfriend had the ribs (amazing) and I had the Bobby D burger which is a ribeye steak sandwich with fries and coleslaw that puts primanti bros to shame. The bar has essential spirits which make selection easy, and a nice selection of beer and wine. The service is always great with owners occasionally swinging by to chat and make sure everything is good. The pricing of everything we've had has also been great. We've already returned several times and plan to continue to do so. Love this place."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Mark is the owner who was very friendly and greeted every customer! This place is well worth the visit! Restaurant has only been opened for only 7 weeks and certainly brings in the crowd! I highly recommend trying everything on the menu! LOL! We will visit this establishment when we are back in Pittsburgh because their food is so addicting!!! Great job Mark and we will see you real soon! Aloha! Brad and Cheryl Richards"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  I had the Mac and Cheese Skillet with grilled shrimp.  My boyfriend had the Ribs.  I loved my meal, and my boyfriend loved his.  I tried his ribs, and already decided that's next visits meal for me.  I'm nt even a rib person, but they were amazing! Fall off the bone, tender, and the perfect amount of smokey flavor.   Waitress was great too.  I believe the owner also stopped by to make sure all was well.  Whatever you guys are doing, keep doing it!  The only downside is the quality of the food caused a lack of dinner conversation because we were both busy stuffing our faces!"}
{"text":"I stopped in last night when my boyfriend and I were looking for someplace near by to grab dinner before mini golf. The reviews online looked decent and it was new so we gave it a shot. After much debate looking at the menu I went with the brisket nachos because I have a hard time resisting nachos. Sadly, they weren't all that great. The only thing really on them was brisket and nacho cheese that tasted like it came out of a jar. It had a lot of potential if they would add some more ingredients with more flavor such as pico, pickled jalapeños, more beans, green onions, etc. While my entree definitely wasn't exciting I would still like to go back and give one of the other entrees I had my eye on a try."}
{"text":"Love the Rueben sandwich and I suggest to substitute the french fries with the best mac and cheese anywhere. Also, we went on during a Pens game and they have great drink specials. I have yet to try the bbq because I love the rueben so much, but im sure I will be trying them soon enough."}
{"text":"Only giving two stars bc the waitress was nice... burgers were way over cooked and dry... GF bun was the stalest piece if bread I ever picked up in my life, my mom's house chips were still sliced potatoes. Mules are $9.00 and in a very small cup ***tasted no vodka. Normally don't leave reviews, bad ones at that but very disappointed in my decision to try it out. Very overpriced for the quality of food and area."}
{"text":"The wings were really good but the burger I had smelt burned and the burger I had didn't taste fresh at all. The fries looked soggy and they weren't even hot. Very unappealing.  The service wasn't that great but we were compensated for the burger.  We were compensated for the wings as well because our server forgot to give them to us for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I was torn as to whether to write this review between wanting to shout about how good this restaurant is and not wanting it to become over-crowded, because we love just being able to walk in and get a table right away.  But -- I can't, in all good conscience, not shout about how special this place is and how great the food and service are.  My husband and I are confirmed \"foodies\" and have had several dishes prepared here, but last night's special took the prize.  I have traveled all over for business and been to many different restaurants -- including here in Pittsburgh -- and I have never had a dinner as amazing as this one.  The special was seared marlin with roasted pineapple, over risotto with a side of black bean salsa.  It was the perfect fusion of Asian and Mexican with just a touch of heat.  The portion was more than enough and I ended up with it for lunch the next day.  The marlin, which is notoriously hard to cook right, was done to perfection!  A taste treat cooked medium, seared with flavor on the outside, tender, flaky and not even the slightest hint of dryness on the inside. I was in heaven.  The risotto was flavorful, the salsa an incredible mixture with a great crunch and finished off with a red pepper-dusted ring of FRESH pineapple, roasted to a perfect consistency.   While our favorites still remain their fish sandwich and \"the Bobby D\" sandwich, this dinner was a real eye opener to the caliber of the chef.  Hats off to Bobby D's and despite our love for a \"less traveled\" restaurant, we wish you all the success in the world!  Stay with us, we need you in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this local place one evening and were pleasantly surprised. The owner is very friendly as are the staff. The inside is modern with multiple Tv's. A bar is on one side and the restaurant on the other. So far I have had the chicken salad sandwich, hot banana pepper hoagie, and pulled pork. They use Mancinis bread and other local ingredients. My mom had the Rachel and said it was one of the best that she has had. My fiance had the grilled chicken sandwich which was smaller. He said it was good, but not his favorite. Another perk is that you can substitute out the fries for your side. The fire roasted veggies are great and you can taste the smoke on them. The baked beans are also great. They have pieces of pulled pork an bacon in them. Other sides you can get include coleslaw and potato salad which I have not tried yet."}
{"text":"The hubs and I were in the area and decided to drop in here for dinner.  It's billed as a BBQ joint but the decor was much nicer than a typical BBQ place. The restaurant was about half full when we were seated. I always peek at other people's food before I order in a new restaurant. Everything that came out of the kitchen was plated nicely and looked inviting. 
We decided to split the Sampler Platter. It was $28 which we thought was a little pricey. We added a side to make sure we would have enough food.  We laughed at ourselves when they brought it out. There was a whole table of food!!!  More than worth $28. Way more. 
I started with the boneless chicken breast. The BBQ sauce on it heavily hinted of coffee. It was a very different flavor but I really enjoyed it. The ribs were falling off the bone as I was putting them on my plate. Can you say moist??  The sauce was more of a traditional sauce and it was very good. We had a serving of shredded pork and shredded brisket. Brisket is usually served sliced but I much more preferred it shredded. The sauce for those two items was on the side. It seemed to have a smokies flavor. They gave us a basket of slider buns. The buns were fresh and made a great vehicle to eat the shredded meats. For sides we had coleslaw, baked beans, potato salad, and Mac and cheese. Since Mac n cheese is one of the recent crazes I was curios how it would stand up to others that I have tried. I'm from the South so I will use a southern expression that people use when something is over the top good-that Mac n cheese made me want to slap my momma. I would go back just for the Mack cheese. It was very cheesy. If I remember correctly it had 5 types of cheese. It was melty and gooey and held on to the corkscrew pasta perfectly.  Nomnomnom. 
Now the little bit of sadness. I would have loved to have given 5 stars. However we had poor service. We only saw our server when we ordered our food and when we got the check. Our drinks were never refilled and we asked the young man cleaning tables to get us To Go containers for our food. He was very kind and helpful. Had our server been more attentive I would have easily given 5 stars."}
{"text":"After watching all the Super Bowl festivities in Houston and seeing all this BBQ, I was craving so, l found this little gem on Yelp and headed out. Our server, Jordan, was awesome! She was so super friendly, explained the menu and specials. 
I ordered the brisket sandwich with nacho cheese with on it & homemade chips and the hubs got the brisket Ruben with fries. Everything was so delicious. I can't wait to come back and try some other items. We're new customers for a long time to come."}
{"text":"We came here the other day for lunch and it was great. Ranted and raved about it to my grandpa who has lived here his whole life. Came back into town today so brought him for lunch. Unfortunately, our waitress had \"bad blood\" with our family and she knew it from the second we sat down. I'm talking from 20+years ago! My grandpa was disappointed with how he was treated just bc of that. She wouldn't ask him if he wanted a refill so I had to go to the bar and get him a water refill myself. He spilled his glass of water and we showed her and she left it there the whole time! I mean come on!! The food is fantastic but the immaturity of the waitress was despicable"}
{"text":"This I phenomenal place to eat or if you just want drinks you could do that too. Everyone is very friendly and inviting. I come here about once every month and it's really good. Today I got my first ever in my whole life. It was huge and ate it all. Delicious."}
{"text":"This restaurant is off the chain fabulous.  The food is grade A and the service is excellent.  I order taco's and  Burritos they were the best I've ever had!  I will definitely go back.  The staff rocks!!  BEST FOOD IN THE BURGH"}
{"text":"It isn't often that I run into a place I've been hunting for but that turned out to be the perfect case here. I stopped in here after my seminar at Hess to try out this place. I was told that I could sit anywhere so I sat down at a booth.

I can see why they call this place a barbecue because they have a roll of paper towels for you to use once you are done with your napkin. The place wasn't too busy and my waitress came and told me today was \"Latin\" or taco Tuesday. They had a special Mexican menu on the chalkboard. I wasn't really in the mood for Mexican since I've been wanting to try one of their burgers. I opted for the brisket burger. It is served on a Mancini bun and is topped with melted cheese and onions. Needless to say it was a half pound of meat! Along with it you get a choice of fries or chips. Other sides such as corn on cob, baked beans, sweet potato fries, etc run $3.00 each.

Believe me this sandwich was so good it was a wonder I ate it all. It comes with a side of horseradish sauce to boot. Portions sizes are very generous and prices reasonable. Fries were on greasy side but they were still very good.

There are TV sets around along with a bar. When I had finished my mammoth meal she asked if I wanted dessert. Unfortunately had to pass on that one but at least was glad I had the opportunity to finally dine here. Located in the Kenmawr plaza  in McKees Rocks next to Hess physical therapy there is a private parking lot. Please note that there is construction on part of McKees Rocks road. Suggested detours are posted."}
{"text":"Visiting from California. Always wanting to try something local. Food is A-Mazing. Everything we ate tasted home made with the \"luv\". 
Had the BBQ Wings on wing night, perfect balance of sweet with a little heat. The smoked sausage Mac n cheese was great, any of the meat adds would be great. Added the Southwest Eggrolls for a punch of South West and was not disappointed. 
We'll recommend to anyone we know. 
And Erin gets a high five for great service! Thanks for making our visit great."}
{"text":"Had the smoked brisket burger and it was absolutely delicious. Smoked wings were on point so was the Mac n cheese. Their home made chips gave that great crunch factor.Clean environment, have bunch of TVs also have a bar. Service is pretty good. Definitely recommended."}
