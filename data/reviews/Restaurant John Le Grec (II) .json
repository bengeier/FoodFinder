{"text":"John Le Grec is a pretty good Greek restaurant, probably the only authentic one in the Laurentians. They serve a delicious breakfast, with some of the best breakfast potatoes, Greek style, you can have. Their lunch and dinners are good as well, offering the typical Greek selections. I do think they are rather cheap with the condiments, either the cream cheese for breakfast or the tzatziki that comes with souvlakis. We made the mistake of asking for extra tzatziki once and we were charged extra! At a Greek restaurant!"}
{"text":"I vacationed in St Adele, and we tried this place out, I enjoy the pizza and traditionally in the US , it doesn't come with fries, well these did and the fries were good.  We tried other plates and they were ok, the staff is friendly and helpful!!"}
{"text":"Location: In Ste. Ad√®le village. While it doesn't look like it, you CAN park in front of the restaurant (no meters, either) or in the public lot that is just past the restaurant. There is no fee to park there.  The place: The restaurant is a fairly good size with plenty of seating indoors and limited seating outdoors. The caveat here, is that if you sit outside, it can be VERY noisy, as the terrace is just off the main road. Locals do love this place so it can be busy on weekends.   The goods: Since they had a table d'hote menu, I opted for that. I had the butterfly shrimp with rice, vegetables and Greek potatoes. I don't have anything negative to say about this other than I would have liked more veggies. The shrimp were delicious and there were way more then I expected! My mum ordered the same thing and we were both very happy with our dishes. The portions are very good for the price. My dad ordered the filet mignon, which I know, you might hesitate to order in this type of restaurant. That being said, he thoroughly enjoyed it. I don't think you can go wrong with anything that you order here - the food is solid, the portions are good and you leave with a full belly.  Service: Good.  Price point: You get good value for the money. I picked up the bill but don't remember exactly how much it came out to.... I think with tip, it was about $90.   If you're in the area, John le Grec is worth checking out!"}
