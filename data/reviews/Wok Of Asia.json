{"text":"Chili chicken was good, not the best i have ever had but  good enough to keep me coming back as was the General Tao chicken. Great value. Food is good and prices are very reasonable. Thos is more of a pickup or fast food place."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Clean restaurant and friendly staff. We dined in and the our food came quite quickly. Portions are good too. Ordered 3 plates came out full and with leftover!"}
{"text":"One of the best Hakka Chinese food I have tasted in the area.  We tried the Manchurian chicken and Chilli Chicken and both were very delicious.  You order at the counter and the food is delivered to your table piping hot and expertly prepared in a matter of minutes.  The restaurant is extremely clean and has a very modern decor; staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and gave good recommendations.  The restaurant's ambiance was also comfortable and inviting.  Will definitely return the next time I have a craving for Hakka Chinese food."}
{"text":"The best in the west  Hakka Chinese  and Thai cuisine by far! have waited a long time for a place like this to come to Rexdale and it's finally here. Fast take out, excellent service, friendly  helpful staff. Mouthwatering dishes. You cannot go wrong! Industrial area workers and Humber College students have made this favorite a very busy place at any time! the seats go fast, best to call ahead for the take out."}
{"text":"Arguably the best Hakka Indian Chinese food ever. Honestly cannot go anywhere else cause this place is just too damn good. General Tao is amazing! The lunch special that comes up to just under $7 after tax will definitely fill you up, and it comes with a drink or soup. If it's your first time and you're thinking about trying this place, let me save you time, DO IT. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"Very delicious hakka food with quite a large portion. Friendly staff members make the place more enjoyable to go to."}
{"text":"Good place.  I liked there Manchurian and chilli chicken.  The fish wasn't that good but the chicken dishes were delightful."}
{"text":"This is our family's fave restaurant! The food is so flavorful, your choice of spicy or non-spicy. It's always fresh, hot and quick to be brought to the table or packed ready for take out. It's very affordable, with many dishes to choose from. The service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent value for the money. Amazing lunch deals for 7 bucks and the whole crew dishes out amazing food. Amazing service! I'm now a regular"}
{"text":"By far one of my favourite all around restaurants. For under $8 you get an amazing meal. My personal favourite is the chili chicken, with a little extra spice! Staff is really friendly and make you feel like a guest."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent! Fast, fresh, and healthy. If you want white meat options they've got it. The manager, and employees are very kind. Lots of space, very clean. It's my favourite Hakka restaurant!"}
{"text":"Uggghhh! This restaurant is near to my home so I thought to visit there. When we grabbed a seat... suddenly we realized that smell is horrible. Without ordering something we ran outside of it and will never visit again!"}
{"text":"Have heard a lot about this place,so we planed to try this place. We ordered chilli chicken combo and veg manchurian combo with fried rice as take out. Worst Chinese food ever. Chilli chicken was so salty, could not eat it. Veg manchurian balls were so dry and hard. Don't understand what the hype is about.  Didn't wanted to give even 1 star, but that's the minimum."}
{"text":"Food is ok but make sure if you require halal you have to mention when ordering. Although i asked for halal they gave me regular but the staff at counter was alert and took the order back. Staff is nice and portions are good."}
{"text":"I've been to this location once and bought the vegetable manchurian pakora style. I must say that location is in a small plaza with tight parking and for the price, I was not impressed.  The pakoras were very soft and the sauce was not spicy at all. The portion was a decent size. I have tried their hot and sour soup which is decent. Overall, it would not be my top pick for hakka style food, but it is very popular with the Humber students nearby."}
{"text":"-Amazing lunch deals for aprrox. $7 -Fast service -Halal :)"}
{"text":"I love their chili chicken! So good. I highly recommend this place. Great food for low price with specials at $6 with soup or drink included"}
{"text":"Freshly cooked and tasty food, good ambience as well. Try the bean stir fry green beans"}
{"text":"I love this place I order veggie fried rice which is very good and I them make Mancharian shrimp..it's soooo good"}
{"text":"Just your typical hakka place however the portions are huge! I have never been able to finish my plate and always packed it to go. They serve generously.   Their manchurian was nice, fried rice was okay, and fried noodles tasted good as well. If you like typical chinese food, try this out."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for cheap delicious student eats!  I come here once a week, and I have tried a lot of their weekly specials.  Chili chicken, red curry, and chili tofu are some of my top favorites. The service is also quick and efficient, if you choose to dine in, the staff will bring your dish to your table ^^"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely terrible. I ordered the green curry chicken with noodles and everything was undercooked. The noodle was undercooked the veggies were undercooked. Also, the veggies were in huge chunks including the onions, which was disgusting. Also, the staff were eating while there was a line of people, consequently the food was coming out extremely slow."}
{"text":"I enjoy the Thai food here. Pad Thai is great. Sweet and sour chicken and garlic on rice is also amazing. I have eaten here a few times and enjoy it every time. Great value menu too for lunch with free drink. Service is sometimes slow because they make everything fresh and in demand."}
{"text":"Excellent food, most everything I have tried on the menu is amazing. The ingredients, specifically,the vegetables are fresh. You can clearly see the quality in the dishes when they are prepared."}
{"text":"I read the positive reviews for this hidden gem. So I walked in after 1:15 pm, and I saw a few patrons eating inside. I decided to eat in, instead of takeout. A couple of the reviews said to order their all day special of Manchuria Chicken with rice including soup or pop. I ordered their hot & sour soup. I sat down & I noticed that the tables & floor were clean. It did not  take long for my soup to be served, it was very hot which I prefer. In about 10 mins the main dish was served and I was surprised how big the plate was. Anyway I loved the spiciness of the food. The chicken was tender, and for the rice I added soy sauce. It was very filling & delicious. I had to take 1/2 of what was left over, In a take out container. I thanked the person who took my order. I will definitely come back & try something else of the 19 all day special meals."}
{"text":"Decent Hakka style food at a reasonable price.   We were impressed by the high degree of cleanliness factor and friendly service.   Even the decor is OK -- not a dress to impress type of place, but makes you feel confortable.  But considering they have a list of all day \"lunch specials\" for $6 and some larger portion entrees (mostly in the $8-9 range), they do a nice job for the price.  It is semi--cafeteria style:  You order at the counter and then they'll deliver to your table -- steaming hot.  We liked the chilli chicken and singapore noodles dish."}
{"text":"I bought the chilli chicken dish and the green chicken curry daily special.  Both dishes left much to be desired, the green curry was particularly bland.  The chilli chicken I prefer a little more dry, however it was passable.  I would have given this place a 2 star rating, however the service was pleasant and they do give you a good quantity for the price. It would not be a restaurant I recommend for some mind blowing chinese food, however it is something you can grab if you just feel like stuffing your face."}
{"text":"Great value for pretty tasty food. $5.95 for satay beef with rice and a drink."}
{"text":"I have been to Wok of Asia a couple of times. The first was several months back, when my boyfriend was getting a navigation system installed in his car. We met up at that store and then we drove in my car to Wok of Asia.  I ordered the garlic chicken that came with rice,. It was okay. I wished that there were more garlic in the dish. He wasn't too hungry, and went with hot and sour soup. He told me that it was filling.  You basically order at the counter and then select a table or booth to sit at. A server comes over with your meal. It's cool. There are TVs at the restaurant if you are alone and want to watch a program while you eat.  The last time I was at the restaurant, I ordered chilli chicken to go. I liked how it tasted. It came with plenty of rice. I still have my favourite Hakka places in Mississauga (Chopstick Cuisine, Royal Jasmine, and China Garden), though. I may have to sample some other dishes at Wok of Asia to gauge my rating. For now, the food is good here.  (20)"}
{"text":"always walked by this spot every time I head over to Osmows, but decided to try this joint out with my brother. first time going inside and lemme tell you the Menu can be very intimidating theres no pictures unless you look at the paper menu, so I just picked the Murchurian Chicken with Fried Rice and a pop.   it took a solid 20 minutes to get our food, didn't know it would take that long, so if you go, try for pick up, or know you have to time to spare to wait for you food. Not sure if it was me but it didn't seem THAT busy but there were a few orders on the desk before ours. I know one dude that was getting really impatient because he was probably really hungry and waited even longer than us and he was there before us.   got it to go, There wasn't any fork or napkins in the bag, Im starting to think the forks and napkins were somewhere around there to put in yourself which I failed to do so.  The food was great, definitely got that flavour that I was looking for in Hakka.   If I decide to go again I would call before hand to pick up instead of waiting for my food for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Spicy garlic chicken... mmm I'm not see much there...where the chicken?  $9.50 I think to pricy with only have very little chicken.  Manchurian beef I'm not for sure with the taste."}
{"text":"This resturant has really good hakka Chinese food. I recently had the chilli chicken there and it was great!  The decor is ok, in between a diner and a resturant, bit there is room to expect a seat. Most people order to go. Give it a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Disgusting I saw the Cook while i was waiting for my food he dropped big spoon they use it for the fryer and he pick it up and keep using it like nothing happen and when i told him about that I thought they will take care of it right away but unfortunately they guy who did it its the owner and he tried to ignored me as much as he can but when i asked for my money he gave me back my money and instead of he apologize he told me never come back. Who in the right mind go back to a restaurant like that."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Hakka place.  I used to be here 2-3 times a week!  Now that I no longer consult in that area, I only go when I'm nearby. I rate Hakka by the Chilli Chicken and Hot and Sour Soup.  The CC here is my personal fav of all the places I've been and the HOT in hot and sour is truly represented here. For about $7 for a lunch combo - Meal + Soup or Pop, it's a great deal! Last time I was there, the owner greeted me with a huge smile and already placed my order as I walked through the door. I really need another client on this side of town soon!"}
