{"text":"One of the best burritos for a chain restaurant.  I highly recommend trying their smother burrito"}
{"text":"Great chain that doesn't make you feeling queasy or guilty like most fast food places.  This location in particular is owned by a very friendly family and they run the place efficiently and spotlessly.  Ingredients are always fresh, and servings are always plentiful and worth the money.  Great go-to!"}
{"text":"Recently stopped in to the Beltline location of mucho burrito.  The staff was friendly, the food was fresh, and the service was quick.  There is parking at the front of the store which made it ideal for stopping in on the way home from work. 

Will definitely be back for another burrito!!!"}
{"text":"We have been driving by for about 6 months now. We really should have stopped sooner. The food is great and you can order and get exactly what you want as they build your burrito (taco..etc) right in front of you. If you compare the serving size to cost ratio. I think Taco time is in a lot of trouble. If you want Mexican food that is a step above fast food, this is the place."}
{"text":"Lovely people. Had a little nice talk with the owner, very gentle man. Clean place, good food, excellent service."}
{"text":"Yeah, I know it's a chain...But damn, are those burritos ever mucho!!!

This is Americanized Mexican food at it's best. It's a high-speed burrito assembly line from start to finish. Pick your size, pick your meat, tell them to put everything on it and yes you want jalepeños. These guys put out burritos like Tim Hortons puts out Double-doubles and they're so packed full of stuff you get to work out those bulging biceps every time you lift it toward your face. Eveb still, there's something about them that lets you think that maybe, just maybe you can trick yourself into believe what you are eating is healthy. Afterall, it's just chicken, rice, and beans, right? And cheese and sour cream, and guac and... 

It seemed like a few of the toppings they asked if I wanted may have been extra, but I'm not sure which ones because they didn't say they would be more. The guacamole, probably... I'm sure it says on the menu but I didn't get much opportunity to read it because the line moved so fast. I'm new! I'm not good at ordering burritos under pressure!

I'll be back again...but next time it will be on the stumble home from a night of drinking."}
{"text":"Probably the best run Mucho in the city. They drain the beans in front of you so they are not soaking wet which is really nice. They are not skimpy on the Guac like other locations (Shawnessy). Owner seems to always be there during rush hour and the employees actually look like they are having a good time ."}
{"text":"This place is a rip off. Probably the worst Mucho in the city. So skimpy on toppings."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the worse mucho burrito locations. Their portion sizes are sparse, they scoop items into your burrito before they even ask if you wanted it or not. They just don't care at all. I've been to other locations and definitely noticed a difference in the staff and quality/quantity of the food so it's for sure just this location. Sucks too cause they are located so conveniently for a lot of downtown people..."}
{"text":"It's a mucho burrito so food is as expected.
But dam the service is bad! Not only they aren't that friendly but we made the mistake to order churros... supposed to be 8mins wait... they forgot us, we had to go claim our churros after almost 20mins... and it took them another 20mins to be served. No compensation offered and a very tiny apology just because the guy saw our very unhappy faces. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in because northbound rush hour traffic on 14th St NW was horrific. Glad I did! My first time, so I tried a small shredded beef burrito with mild salsa, a few jalapeños, and chipotle mayo. Everything was fresh, it's the best Mexican food I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here from time to time. It is like a healthy kind of fast food, so I don't feel so guilty. The food always seems fresh, and it always tastes good.

One time I wanted to try the churros and the cashier talked me out of it saying they take 3 minutes and \"do I really want them if they take that long\" that was slightly disappointing, but other than that great service."}
{"text":"I was hankering for a fish burrito and it had been awhile since I've checked out Mucho Burrito so I decided to give this location a try.  Previously an aging Mr. Sub location, this Mucho Burrito is a bit small compared to the others but is the perfect size for the area.  The dining area has a couple of TV's that were turned into sports (I guess you can go here for Flames games if all else fails).

The menu is well laid out and the choices are easy to understand.  What I like about Mucho Burrito is they don't give you a million different choices.  There is enough of a selection to get what you want but not make you standing there trying to Google the items for more info.  The lady was nice enough to explain to me they discontinued the fish.... :((  It's OK, I went with a mixed pulled pork and  beef burrito.  I went with a medium and it got me plenty full. I could only finish 3/4 of it so I saved it for later.

Everything was great and the prices are reasonable (under $10).  Guacamole was an extra $1 and was a bit lack luster as they didn't give me enough to even taste it.

4-stars, 5-stars if they decided to make guacamole free... It's like charging for lettuce or tomato at burger joins.  Sure avocados are expensive but I'm sure their distributor buys them by the truckloads."}
{"text":"We took an unexpected stop here when my 3 year old had to use the bathroom in a hurry. Since it was almost lunchtime, we ordered a bowl with pulled pork.  Quite tasty but my son wanted nothing to do with it.  Instead the friendly woman there (owner?) had given us a side of pinto beans and chicken for him.  She clearly knows his tastes better than me because he devoured it.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Love it here. The burritos are huge. And the mucho burrito is GIANT! I like the Taco Trio because I don't feel like I'm going to explode when I'm done eating. Like the first reviewer said, they do like their cilantro so if you're not a cilantro fan like me, you might not be so happy with your meal."}
