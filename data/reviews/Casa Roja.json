{"text":"At the intersection of unseasoned food and uninterested service was our meal here tonight.  We loved the location and the vibe and badly wanted to love it.  But....  We had the paella.  It was mushy and utterly lacking in flavor.  Our server told us she was bringing the bill before we asked for it and when we both had clearly empty water glasses.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Great patio (no view of the falls if that's you're thing but still good) with modest selection of tapas and main dishes. Red sangria was great and service was excellent. Front patio great for people watching."}
{"text":"I should have been worried when we walked in and we were they only customers in the place with M and Jekyll's, both down the street, were both on 1 hour plus waits.  The sangria was awesome and several were enjoyed.  Some of the tapas we awesome while others we a complete miss.  Pork Rhine=not terrible but not a $5 app.  Olives, you get about 1 ounce for $5.  Cabbage and peppers salad was outright terrible.  I enjoyed the croquets and chorizo stuffed peppers.   I feel overall that the prices are not reasonable and that the portions are way too small.  I understand the point of tapas and that they are supposed to be small plates.  I still think that they take this to the extreme.  I didn't think that the level of their cuisine lives up to their price point.  I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Well. It's weird to eat in an empty restaurant in Chagrin Falls. We had the chorizo sausage paella. It was good but unremarkable.  The decor seemed amateur. Waiter was good.   The whole experience seemed contrived. I've been to Spain and the food is great.  I'm guessing a true Spaniard is not involved in this restaurant.   But. Give it a try. Maybe next time I'll try something else."}
{"text":"Went there for Father Day brunch this Sunday with my wife and two daughters. My wife had the salad with avocado and the black bean soup, the others had French toast and the braised pork sandwich. All were very tasty and good but on the really small side. I understand the concept of tapas but the menu was anything but that. The prices were not for small plated so expectations that they were full size meals. I had the Serrano ham sandwich (see photo), it was excellent ....but tiny...like finger sandwich tiny ~ $12. It was served with a 1/4 cup of cold tasteless orzo salad.  Just be aware, be prepared to pay full prices for very small but tasty portions."}
{"text":"I found the same charm as West End Bistro, which previously occupied this space, when I visited Casa Roja for brunch. Service was friendly and fast.   The menu didn't have an overwhelming amount of breakfast items on it and your traditional side options were not present. Maybe just 25% of the menu was true breakfast. The portion sizes were also quite small and after each having an entrée, my friend and I split a third breakfast entrée.   I had the chorizo hash bowl which was really good and flavorful, just again a little small in terms of substance. It consisted of some ground chorizo mixed with tiny square potato chunks underneath 2 perfectly runny poached eggs. My friend had the eggs benedict, which were traditional, save for a topping of spicy chipotle sauce and bacon. After those dishes we split a French toast simply topped with a sprinkling of pumpkin seeds and coffee whipped cream.   All in all I'll be back for brunch, but this is a place where you can get up in the morning, have something small to eat at home, and then by the time this place opens and you get here after 11 you will still have room for their brunch food."}
