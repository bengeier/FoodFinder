{"text":"Completely lovely in every way! The delicious food, wonderful people, and soothing decor. :) We enjoyed the kanapki, kartofle, and pierogis. The mixed drinks and authentic Polish beer (Okocim) more than hit the spot. Everything we had was bursting with flavor! Great job Apteka crew - can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I had pretty much given up on ever getting to eat Eastern European food when I went vegan. If I hadn't had authentic fare in my pregan days, there was slim chance I'd get it as a vegan.

Leave it to Apteka to change that.

The food was amazing. Simply delicious.

I made the mistake of closing out my tab just after ordering so I had to open it back up to order more!

If you're visiting Pitt like I am, do yourself a favor and visit Apteka."}
{"text":"These folks have worked their way up from an all-you-can eat monthly pop up dinner to Apteka. The food is delicious, all vegan Eastern European(i.e. Polish/Hungarian). It's hard to make good vegan stuffed cabbage and pierogi but they have done it. The borscht is incredible; subtle yet full of flavor. The cocktails are also very good, they pair a lot of unique and offbeat flavors.  The ambiance is simple and inviting, the lighting is good and the space is enjoyable to be in. Large crowds gather on weekend nights so anticipate long lines at those times.  I love this place and will go back again and again."}
{"text":"It seems to be busy and while tables are full they hand us our glass liter of water and glasses. Along with our plates and silverware. Theres no where to sit so i ask if im supposed to just hold our entire dinner table they handed to us and wait until food comes out with no where to go. Why they didnt care at all or have a method of dealing with situations like these are beyond me. If anything they were very rude even. They didnt care at all and i left unhappy after already tipping them while ordering. Horrible service."}
{"text":"Beautiful, delicious, and comfortable--I always feel cozy and sated here.

Environment -- casual & friendly. Place orders up front and seat yourself. The space is carefully decorated without being fussy, with fresh and dried flower arrangements accenting simple wood furniture. The lights are often dimmed in the late evening, which can read as romantic or homey, depending on your company.

Food & drink -- pirogi are a favorite. I've tried several things on their ever-changing menu, and nothing has disappointed. The cocktails are always a pleasant surprise. I will say, though, I once ordered a whiskey sour without thinking about the egg involved, which makes it off-limits at a vegan bar (they were very kind to make an effort to substitute something, though)."}
{"text":"The food is incredible.  The service model is not.  We took out of town guests here on a busy night and it was a nightmare.  All of these people standing around looking for a table.  There was no room to stand either, we were basically on top of and bumping people who were already seated and eating.  At busy times, you are in a competition with other patrons for a table.  People hover around tables that they think will leave soon.  There were people who's food came out of the kitchen before they secured a table.  It was such a nightmare for the people eating and the people waiting.  On busy nights, I also think they must fry up the perogies in advance because they come soggy and slightly cold instead of hot and crisp.  

I adore the food and decor but would only come again during off peak hours."}
{"text":"Love this place.  My absolute favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Even if your not a vegan or vegetarian you will love their delicious and creative food and drinks."}
{"text":"I've always hated vegetables, because it's so hard to cook a decent meal by themselves. This restaurant has probably changed my life forever. If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh, stopping here is a must. I had the 7 pierogi plate, Kanapki, and their special Yogurt Rhubarb. The three tartines were an amazing start, my favorite being the red pepper and tomato one (and tomatoes are my second least favorite vegetable!). The pierogies were for a fact the best food I've had to date. A nutty granola crunch, rosetip dust, and yogurt sauce topped two varieties of pierogies: potato apple, and my favorite, mushroom and sauerkraut. I absolutely HATE mushrooms and sauerkraut, but these pierogies were for a fact the best food I have EVER eaten. It's hard to make a pierogi feel light, but they did a wonderful job at it. Ended with the yogurt Rhubarb for a semi-dessert. I could have that for breakfast everyday.

The restaurant was a little packed by the door where you order, but the aromas and open \"backyard\" seating make up for it entirely.
If you're considering eating here, DO IT!"}
{"text":"The concept at Apteka is modern, fun, and sleek - vegan food at its best. Location is easy with lots of street parking on the stretch of Penn Ave across from the Allegheny Cemetary.

The atmosphere was nice, welcoming, and not too crowded on a tuesday evening. A lovely patio out back and good amount of seating in a simple but stylish air.

The food was fantastic. The Pierogis were excellent, all parts of them. Excellent dough, prefectly made; the mushroom variety was my favorite. Also very thoughtful and superb black bean and arugula salad, and a potato starter that was very nice.

Starters are between $5-8, and salads around $10. An order of 7 Peirogis was $11. All in all, though I am not a vegan, I will come back."}
{"text":"The food and cocktails were quite impressive. The staff was super friendly and handled the crowd well.  I highly recommend this unique and delicious spot!"}
{"text":"Wow! I wasn't so sure when we walked in and had to order at the counter and then sit down, but I WAS WRONG! Everything, from the cocktails to the entrees to the sandwiches were conceived and created with care, attention to detail, and authenticity. Everything was DELICIOUS. Oh and btw everything is vegetarian and vegan-adaptable, but ya won't miss the meat let me tell you! Na zdrowie!"}
{"text":"Loved Apteka! Not a vegan but had to come check it out and it did not disappoint. Favorite part was the Scotch with citrus notes and Fernet to enjoy at the end of the meal. Was an enjoyable dining experience as the staff seem to enjoy and take pride in their job and the atmosphere is casual and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great food, quick and friendly service, very calm atmosphere.  

The interior is very minimalist and the music choice was fantastic. 

We ordered a plate of 7 pierogis and the Horse & Pepper sandwich.  
Both were fantastic and with only two people, there were plenty of leftovers to take with us.

It had only been open for 6 weeks at the time, I am interested to see how this place develops."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back! I only got drinks and desert but it was a stellar experience and I'm stoked to go back!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The atmosphere is ok.. not a ton of seating and pretty crowded and well.. hipster. But if you can get past that the food is AMAZING. and reasonably priced. As were the drinks. Well be back!"}
{"text":"Great dining options for big family events or a semi-formal dinner for two. It has a pleasing looking bar with great decorations through the restaurant. The customer service is exceptional. The stuffed vegan pirogies were to die for! Amazing flavors and textures that fill your taste buds. I would recommend to another friend."}
{"text":"I overheard the staff saying they just opened a month ago, doing great! Food is definitely different but so delicious! We ate from the late night menu. Only complaints is be prepared, it's a messy meal, and the music? What in the world is up with the music? It's like 2000 indie dance bar in there. I get they're trying to go for the hipster vibe, but maybe they went a little overboard. Prices were great (we're used to NY prices) and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Very diffrent from other restaurants..i was the first one there...what is that smell i thought they were smoking cannabis they burnt sage could've fooled me.
The music put you in zone too.food was very good i had pierogies and a sandwich woulda had more but i had children with me i had it to go thats not there food of choice.. ill be back with my other half...."}
{"text":"Best vegan food in this area! A relaxing casual atmosphere, with friendly, prompt servers and interesting, tasty options. We had the perogis, which came with both potato and radish filling, and a luke warm vegetable soup with potato dumplings. Both were fantastic! Good texture and unique flavor.

We ordered dessert as well before finding out about a vegan bakery only a few blocks away, and the staff happily cancelled our order with no friction whatsoever. If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh I'll definitely come again."}
{"text":"Such an awesome menu, very unique. Can't go wrong with anything on it. 

Friendly service too. 

Gets very busy so plan ahead and be ready to wait at least a few minutes."}
{"text":"Vegan Polish food sounded like a good joke to me, but they really make it work. Brought my mom here to blow her mind and show here that meatless life is possible even if you're Polish.
Poppy seed soda and pepper soda - only soda I'll ever accept!"}
{"text":"This Euro-esque cafe has been on the list since inception. Planned an early Friday night dinner with no problem grabbing a table for two. Not an expert on it, but the menu had a heavy Polish influence. Started with a Pittsburgh fav - pierogis, but vegan style with greens, mushrooms and spices. Topped with a tangy sauce, scallions, and shredded beets. They were good and the price was fair. Endive with prunes and mushrooms was a tasty starter. Not something you'll find on other local menus. My favorite dish was the lentil stuffed cabbage in a zesty tomato sauce with crispy cabbage on the side. All dishes had a classic foundation with a vegan and crafty touch. Topped off the meal with a bourbon, plum, and sage cocktail. Not as strong as is like but tasty. Will come back again, especially for the Golabkis!"}
{"text":"Meatatarians, have no fear. Do your vegan and vegetarian friends a service and come here for dinner one night. Don't be intimidated, don't think you won't get a good meal, and come with an open mind. If Eastern European food (Americanized or not) is up your ally, you won't be disappointed.

They work as a cafeteria style setup where you wait in line to order, find an open table (if you can) and wait for your food. Want to add another cocktail or a dessert? No need to get back in line, just order from one of the bartenders or waitstaff. 

Don't know what your ordering? Ask lots of questions. The staff was wonderful and didn't act surprised or upset if you needed help with the menu.

My wife and I split three different plates including a large plate of pierogis (how can you not order pierogi here?!) and enjoyed every bite, and how affordable it was. The cocktails are more daunting but man, they were delicious. I had one that was scotch based with apple and seasoning which was delicious, while we wife had a plum liqueur based cocktail which was sour and refreshing.

It's no doubt they opened in the exact right neighborhood and everyone raved about the food on their way out as we overheard plenty of guests since we sat at the bar. Give em a try!"}
{"text":"SO I WALK INTO A VEGAN RESTAURANT IN A LEATHER JACKET...FAIL...AND YET I'M TRANSPORTED TO MY LITHUANIAN CHILDHOOD..WIN!

Hi My Dears!

I've been dying to try this place and Vegan establishments are gaining ground and an interest to the Yinzers. I decided to meet \"Dr.Oxford\" for a dinner date. And can I just tell you, I pulled together an cute outfit. I looked fly! Camel leather jacket, cerulean blue deep v neck sweater, leopard shoes, cute jeans...I looked fab! ::Walks in door:: OH LORD! I FEEL YOUR EYES PEOPLE! Sooo, fashion faux pas aside, we get a dark corner table in the back (all great dates start in dark corners!). I missed that you have to go to the bar to order. And once we got there we decided on a couple plates. 

All jokes aside, the minute I got my salad I was transported back to traditional Lithuanian/Baltic flavors. Dill, potato, beets and earth flavors. It was a great flood of food memories. I was kind of floored and not expecting it! We spent the night talking about our Eastern European food memories and had a great meal. Food criticism, potato pancakes were not what I was expecting. You kind of can't beat Latkes fried in shmaltz! Sorry!

Downsides, I feel old with the hipster crowd and the DJ pumping! I can't maintain my whitty flirty banter over the club thump of the music. My fashion choices revealed that I was more of a plus size Christy Brinkley \"Uptown Girl\" and less \"Oh Oh Ophelia\" than I thought!

I actually want to take my mom here! She is less hip than I but I feel she would greatly appreciate the great flavors and inventive dishes here!

I'll be back!

Love you - muah!"}
{"text":"Unique music and drinks and the most filling vegan food at great prices. The clean and simple atmosphere lets the beautiful food and drinks be the spotlight."}
{"text":"This place is a must if you are vegan/vegetarian, and even if you aren't, you need to try it. Apteka has done an amazing job creating awesome plates that really highlight how great vegan food can be.
The pumpkin soup was a great starter and the pierogis are on point. They are not your traditional potato-cabbage-cheese pierogis. They are unique and have great flavor combinations. They are smaller plates and make for super easy sharing between people. We ordered three different things and shared them between two people. Plenty of food for the both of us.
It is important to be aware that this is not a traditional sit-down restaurant. It is more of a bistro that requires you to order prior to taking a seat. They menu is listed on a huge wall next to the counter for all to see. The atmosphere is also very calm and welcoming. Staff is friendly and the drinks are strong! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Best vegan spot in Pittsburgh. Worth the wait. Must try the pierogies. Great drink selection."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place! I actually even donated to the Kickstarter and was so excited to go. The music was weird but the food was fine. We got the pierogis and ate a bunch of them when my boyfriend's throat started itching. He's allergic to cashews and they were not listed on the menu. 

We booked it home to grab meds, so thank god we live close. I can't eat dairy and was so excited for a dietary conscious restaurant...but i guess it's only conscious for some of us.

The two stars are because the food was pretty good and they seemed apologetic. They just need to start listing their allergens moving forward."}
{"text":"Ate here again for the third time this past weekend and as with the previous visits before, a few of the plates were misses for me, but for the most part, delicious and unique food that's highly recommended visiting.  It's pretty much common knowledge regarding Apteka, but the pierogies are fire as well as the cocktails.  Cool atmosphere, and a very relaxed dining experience."}
{"text":"What a unique joint! The uncluttered, clean asthetic, friendly staff, and absolutely mind-blowing food make this a must stop for vegetarians, vegans, and carnivores alike. How can you miss the meat when you have interesting taste combinations overloading your taste buds. We tried the perogies, potato dumplings, and tartines. We chose the dishes based on Yelp reviews. Also, we asked the gentleman working the counter, who took our order (Jack, who was very friendly and knowledgeable), what would go best with our main picks. He was right on point. The cocktails sounded great, but I ended up having the Draai Laag table beer. This place scored major points for having both Roundabout and Draai Laag on tap. 

No doubt we'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! I grew up with Polish food on Christmas, and have a soft spot for it in my heart, but I've always thought of it as objectively pretty bland and boring. Apteka proves that wrong! This place has a great comfortable and friendly vibe, delicious, interesting, foodie-compatible food, and a nice drink menu (both cocktails and local craft beers were solid). Will come again."}
{"text":"Mind boggling!!! Absolutely fantastic food, each dish is just a work of art, delicious! Great atmosphere and service!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Everything is fresh, tasted delicious. The place is cute, feels like you're in California somewhere. Cocktails are very very good too! 5 out of 5 star!"}
{"text":"I can't figure out if this place is popular because it's vegan... or because it's Polish... Because I assure you, it is neither of those things! Wait, I should rephrase that because it is vegan Polish food, but if you're looking for traditional  (which is not vegan), look somewhere else.  I was blown away by the modern Polish take on food and apparently, so is the rest of Pittsburgh because the whole place was packed.

As you walk in, they have the menu on a the wall and you order at the register. The cocktails are a must! We coined them \"grown up juice\" because they're simply amazing drinks that happen to be alcoholic.  

We ordered three plates to split and one Apple tarte to end with.  They recommended we order dessert in the beginning and once we finish dinner, tell the  server who collects the plates and they'll bring dessert out afterwards. Once you order, you find a table. They have a back room that looks like a converted one car garage, that adds a lot more seating. Once we got our food, we chowed down. Everything was delicious. I'm not from Pittsburgh, but if go back just for this restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Everything here is amazing, I usually get the special sandwich and an order or pierogies -- if I could eat Apteka every day I definitely would."}
{"text":"Really fresh take on food. Unusual combos.  Surprisingly filling. - the veggie pate was like an interesting whole grain toasted bread.  Soup was rich and had depth.  Perogies were just delicious and novel.   Decor was very hip."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this spot, it was my intro to polish food and pierogis! On top of that it's vegan! Great service and excellent environment. It does get really busy though get there early!"}
{"text":"My vegetarian sister was in town, so we decided to try Apteka. She was delighted to have something other than a Caesar salad, hold the chicken, on the menu. We got the pierogies to split, and she got a beet sandwich and I got the salad. 

The salad was great, spicier than I thought it would be (but fine by me), and just super flavorful. The pierogies didn't disappoint either, especially the smoked potato. I was actually a big fan of paying first and then finding a table, because we were trying to make it somewhere else quickly afterwards and it was nice to be able to just get up and go when we were finished. We both ordered drinks, which were interesting and delicious, and not terribly priced. I would go again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Great Polish fusion restaurant. Amazing drinks. Love the wildflower with tequila. All the dishes are beautifully prepared.
None of my friends can believe that everything is vegan, they love it so. 
The space is eclectic and wood toned. Love the fresh bouquets of flowers. 
And the signs on the unisex bathrooms are awesome! 
One of the top restaurants in Pittsburgh. And super affordable too."}
{"text":"I love everything about APTEKA. Drink list, fermentations, vegan burger, yum!! Complex and rich flavors for a vegan menu!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 4 times, and they've only been open a couple of weeks.  The atmosphere is clean, comfortable, warm, and friendly.  The staff is very nice.  I spoke to the owner about the food's ingredients/techniques (I'm not vegan and was really impressed to learn what goes into making these dishes without any cream/butter/etc).  I've had just about everything on the menu -- my faves are the Horse & Pepper sandwich, sauerkraut + mushroom pierogi, and potato + yogurt small dish.  The specialty cocktails are excellent too (blackcurrant/burnt lemon/vodka is my fave).  This is my favourite new restaurant in Pittsburgh -- a unique gem offering something fresh and different."}
{"text":"I recently visited Apteka, and I thought the food was great! The kanapki was the star of the menu for me. Each tartine had a distinct flavor palette and was delicious in its own way. Oh, and the pierogies weren't bad either! Check out my full review with pictures!

http://veganhostess.com/2016/03/25/restaurant-review-apteka-pittsburgh/"}
{"text":"Great flavored to all of the dishes and drinks that we tried. The menu is full of well thought out vegan dishes. It was so refreshing to go to a restaurant and not have to get a veggie burger or portobello because there are not options. There were so many delicious options. Even the meat eater with me loved it!"}
{"text":"Wow! Very impressed with this place. We walked in and ordered before we were seated. We got the Kanapki, Placki ziemniaczane z papryka (potato pancakes), Pierogies (7), and Kluski Slaskie (potatoes dumplings). I also got the Becherovka, house tonic, & burnt lemon cocktail. 

The cocktail was served first and was very refreshing and a perfect blend of everything. It went perfectly with the various flavors of the dishes we all shared together. They said this was the most popular drink on the menu. 

The Kanapki had flavorful spreads (tartines) however the House seed bread was extremely difficult to cut/break--especially if another person wanted a bite. 

The potato pancakes were my second favorite! Extremely delicious and flavorful. The spiced/marinated/grilled veggies on the side were delicious. Definitely recommend this one.

The Pierogies were definitely my favorites. However we got 6 mushroom/sauerkraut pierogies and only 1 cabbage/potato pierogie so I didn't get to try the cabbage/potato one. The beets and cucumber + sauce that came with it was awesome though. 

Finally, the potato dumplings were alright. The texture was cool and appealing but the sauce that came with it tasted kind of burned and wasn't very pleasing. I wish the sauce was seasoned slightly more to give it some more flavor

Overall, the place was great. After ordering our food and drinks we received our order within less than 10 minutes! Amazing. The ambiance was very cute and casual. I went on a Wednesday night and there was only one table left (which I took with my friends) when we got there at 7:45pm. Definitely s popular spot and well worth the price."}
{"text":"This place is really unique and delicious.  I am a meat eater, but I like to eat as little as I can to help the environment more. This is one of the places that could convince me that I don't need to eat it at all.  They have super creative dishes that are homemade and tasty.  I've been here twice now and only got one thing that a small disappointment (stuffed cabbage with bulgar wheat).  It's currently not on the menu, so I think they got enough feedback that it was just \"meh.\"  On the latest visit we got the pierogis, tartines, both kinds of sandwiches (Baba Jaga and Special) and the kluski slaskie.   All were either very good or excellent.  Pierogis were definitely the favorite of the table.  The only quibble with the sandwiches were that they were messy to eat with hands (but so tasty!).  So I tried to cut and eat them and it was hard to cut the bread with a knife for some reason.  Our neighbors got the soup and they said it was delicious.  At the end, we had the Piernik dessert which was gingerbread with prune puree in the middle.  One of my friends thought it was too much prune (I think a personal preference).  I did not feel the same. I that it worked well together and was a great ending to a very different eating experience.  

Logistics of the restaurant are a little different than normal sit down places.  You have to know what you want when you walk in and go to the counter to order.  Then they give you a number, you have to find a place to sit and your food is brought to you.  You still have a server who refills water, clears plates and brings you a box. I'm not sure what would happen if you forgot to order something and wanted to add it.  Would you have to wait in line again or could your server add something on and charge you for it?  Probably because they also serve cocktails and beer so you might want to order more of those, but not sure.  My recommendation is go online and look at the menu, confirm that it's still on the board when you get there and order everything at beginning.  They won't bring your dessert until you ask for it which was nice."}
{"text":"Felt like I was in New York! Sat at the bar and had a totally fun night out sharing lots of dishes. Love the mushroom small plate and gin cocktail and really everything we had. Ask for the chicken parm off the secret menu."}
{"text":"Food is incredibly flavorful. Atmosphere is laid back and cheerful. Staff have quick smiles and seem glad to be there. Cocktails are interesting and delicious. Not a vegan or even a vegetarian, and I was thoroughly satisfied and plan to come back."}
{"text":"Apteka - it's vegan, but you can barely tell! 

The Food
This is a vegan establishment, but the food is so interesting you will be satisfied. 
Get the perogies because this is Pittsburgh, and because I told you to. 
For real, they have a regular menu and a \"late night\" menu, all of which is excellent; fresh ingredients, flavorful, and DELICIOUS. 
The perogie hoagie is my personal favorite- literal perogies and sauce and sauerkraut ON A FREAKING HOAGIE BUN. But real talk, you have to be \"on another level\" to eat it. 
The 4 perogies are enough to fill up anyone. They come with a mix of types of perogies with beets on the side. Fresh to DEATH. 
The bar at this establishment is also excellent. They feature a number of drafts (rotating) from local breweries. They also have a full bar with a list of signature cocktails. 

The Staff
The staff is super helpful and great at explaining the unique dishes. They're also great to suggest a good beer or cocktail. 
They also work well as a team here, feel free to ask anyone for anything and they will oblige. And no one is below a 7. (I said it.)

The Ambience
Things at Apteka are done cafe style. So, come in, order, sit at a seat of your choosing, and the staff brings your order to you. Good for small groups, because there's no worries about splitting checks- it's done UPFRONT. Larger groups can be accommodated, too, but seats together depend on the crowd that night. 
The decor is minimal in nature- perhaps a bit too much for my tastes. The walls are cement and the ceiling is open, but I imagine a little more will come with time. 
There are definitely hipsters left and right, I mean, look at the hood, so if you detest their type, stay away. HOWEVER, dope ppl of ALL ages come here, young to late 70s."}
{"text":"Let start by saying I am not a vegan and have no desire to become one.  I love me some cheese.  (I do eat like a vegetarian 95% of the time since I generally don't enjoy the taste of most meats.)

That said, Apteka is incredible.  A vegan pal convinced a few of us to go on a Friday after work and we were skeptical.  However, we all immensely enjoy our meals.  And now I'm hooked.  The pierogies are amazing.  Amazing.  Let me say it one more time: amazing.

The cocktails are all unique with a great balance of flavors.  The bartenders here definitely take the time to create something fresh and delicious.  I've now tried the full list except for the gin (I'm allergic).  The vodka, black currant, vermouth, and burnt lemon cocktail is my favorite.

The service is excellent.  The decor is cool.  The prices are very reasonable.  The bathrooms are in a weird spot and a larger exterior sign would be nice, but it's totally worth a visit...or six."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and have always loved what I have gotten (the borsht is so good!)! Cocktails are really delicious and soo cheap. Beautiful, simple decor as unisex bathrooms."}
{"text":"Just watched What the Health on Netflix and now super scared to eat animal products?? Apteka is he perfect place for you! Feel better about yourself without sacrificing taste. 

It's literally one of the best vegan places I've ever been to! Both their sandwiches are delicious, and of course you can't come here without trying the pierogis!! Absolutely scrumptious."}
{"text":"The hype is real people. Went here for dinner last night with my  husband and 9 month old. The vibe is casual and cool. The decor is simple and I appreciated the selection of tunes. The staff was friendly and helpful. They have a full bar and a selection of local beers (shout out to roundabout brewery).

The menu is small, which I like. We had the tartines, the salad, and the large order of pierogis. The salad and pierogis were delicious! The pierogis were simultaneously doughy and crispy and the filling was a yum twist on the traditional potato and cheese. The tartines were good but I will probably try something else next time and there will be definitely be a next time.

Just a side note- my husband and I cAme here early .. Like 5pm. Not sure how kid friendly it would be much later. They didn't have high chairs."}
{"text":"Yinzer-appropo Central/Eastern European fare meets vegan... whaaa?! Seriously, so delicious. Had a wonderful girls night with a coworker here this summer. Come for the cocktails (I would recommend the vodka/black currant/vermouth/burnt lemon but I don't think you can go wrong), stay for the food. I have fairly high standards as a card-carrying Pittsburgh gal with Polish heritage, so I mean it when I say that the pierogi were absolutely fabulous. My coworker and I keep saying that we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Woohoo as good as it gets is right! I have heard nothing but good things about Apteka and the rumors are true, if you haven't been, hit that bookmark button right now!

Apteka has endless options, all vegan and some gluten free. I had the pierogi's, something I haven't had since I switched to a completely plant based diet over 2 years ago, and they were mouth watering. 

The staff was also incredibly helpful, and patient while I narrowed down my decision(s). They were excited that I was excited, and it could not have made for a better experience."}
{"text":"Everything at Apteka is amazing, besides the dessert. I have not liked any of the deserts I've tried and feel as if the desserts really seem \"vegan.\" Nothing else at this restaurant has been disappointing for me and I've tried almost everything they've offered on multiple different seasonal menus.

We most recently brought four friends here and we ordered *everything* to share, except for dessert and the two soups they were offering at the time. And again everything was delicious. 

The sandwiches have always been my favorite and often times include very interesting and wonderful veggie pate. I've also had their pirogies every time I've been to Apteka and I've never missed sour cream. During this last visit we ordered both salads and I was pleasantly surprised with the unique flavors each salad offered. 

Last, but not least favorite thing about Apteka- their cocktails. I have tried at least 5-6 different cocktails and would recommend any of them. They are consistently refreshing and delicious. Perfectly made in a way that they are very drinkable but are not boring or too sweet. 

Overall, Apteka is wonderful. It's great for most people, even if you're usually a meat eater. If you like eating unique and flavorful food, Apteka is a must visit."}
{"text":"Veggiliciois!!!!! Goodness gracious this place is amazing. I'm a HUGE meat eater and Apteka did not disappoint. I couldn't pronounce a thing on the menu but that didn't stop me from knowing what was in each dish because they created beautiful descriptions for each one. They have everything from small dishes to main courses and desserts. The amount of flavor packed in these vegan dishes was incredible. My mouth and heart were happy.
They have an amazing selection of signature cocktails too. I wish I would have got a pic of the drinks but I was too excited about mine being mixed that I forgot."}
{"text":"Not a vegan but appreciate being vegan lite from time to time. In any event, my friends wife really wanted to try this and he asked if I wanted to meet up here. We had a table of 4 and noticed that upon arriving you order right away. We each ordered an item and a beverage and sat down towards to the back where they are building some outdoor seating! My drink was the (Vodka, black currant, vermouth, burnt lemon) which turned out to be very good. I had some food before I met up so I decided to try their Salatka z koperkiem which is a salad in case you were wondering (salad with sorrel, red mustard greens, shallot, apple, radish escabeche, and lots of dill). My friend got the Pierogi and he said it was amazing! Other drinks of the night included trying a glass of their Birch water which none of us had ever tried. It had a sweet taste but different than coconut water. Almost nutty flavored. It was also semi sweet. We all agreed that it was strangely good. My friend and I at that point decided to infuse it with vodka and other flavors at some point down the road. All in all, we had a good first experience and will be back again at some point. 

Tl;Dr: Vegan cafe that boasts good, creative food with inspiring cocktails. They should have the runners pick up orders from existing customers so you don't have to go back and wait in line if you want another plate or cocktail."}
{"text":"I used to come here once a week when I lived in Pittsburgh. I am not vegan and I got tricked into coming here, and when I saw the menu had no meat, I was saddened. But don't be tricked! It tastes better than any restaurant foods in Pittsburgh and it's really cheap/affordable! Their pierogies are the bomb. Everything is amazing here. It won't disappoint. I crave it every day. I wish this restaurant was a chain restaurant"}
{"text":"Apteka is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. Their creative take on Polish cuisine incorporates flavors that are always new and delicious. They know what they're doing in every aspect of their business and I have a lot of respect for how they built this experience from the ground up. Cocktails are a must try also. Good for late night food, which is rare in Pittsburgh. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"my oh my...... I loved this place. Not only is it completely vegan, but they also have booze! The drink style reminded me of my favorite bar back home in Seattle (I was visiting from out of town). They are unqiue and forms of art. The drink I ordered did not have the right taste for me, but I liked the character it had. Luckily my friend liked it and I liked hers so we traded. We ordered quite a few dishes and each was fantastic taste. I wish I had one of these back home."}
{"text":"I'm not the type that seeks out vegan places and honestly I didn't even know this was a vegan place until I saw the label on Yelp. 

Don't get confused like I did -- you order at the register and take your number to the table. During the week at night, we didn't have a problem finding seating for two but we opted to sit at the bar because there was a nice breeze going on. 

We split an order of pierogi. The celeriac apple potato one is delicious -- not too sweet. The pierogi were done perfectly with the exterior caramelized but still soft and chewy. I would've eaten them all myself but I was trying not to expose myself as a pig."}
{"text":"We went in on Wednesday night based on Yelp reviews and the fact that it's a vegan restaurant. Holy moly was it busy! We got lucky and didn't have to wait for a table, but the place was packed and for a good reason. Both food and cocktails were amazing! We had pirogies (you have to) and golubki. It hit all the right spots! I'm not a vodka drinker, but vodka, black current and burnt lemon was refreshing and very tasty. Whether you're vegan or not, give this place a chance - you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is a vegan restaurant that does not serve veggies trying to pass as meat. They are veggies trying to be veggies. The food is creative, delicious, well prepared, and well presented. And it's very reasonably priced. The flavors are Eastern European, so dill and caraway feature prominently. So do beets, mushrooms, potatoes, and cabbage. This is honest, flavorful cooking served a good price in a friendly atmosphere. At the very least, it is worth a try."}
{"text":"This is by far the best vegan restaurant I have ever eaten at. We come from Ohio, so this was quite the treat for us. From the relaxing ambience, to the congenial staff, to the meticulousness behind the preparation of the food, this was well worth the price. You must try appetizers, main courses, desserts and mixed drinks to get the full experience. Bon apetit!"}
{"text":"It's been 2 months since I've graduated and left Pittsburgh, but going through my photos... I realized I had never reviewed or posted photos for Apteka. Since I left, I've made a top 5 restaurants I HAVE to go to every time I visit Pittsburgh. Apteka makes it on there, without a doubt. 

I've been here a few times with friends, and once for my department graduation banquet. All times were amazing! 

It is sorta in the middle of nowhere - a standalone restaurant, across a cemetery. The ambience is quite... hipster (it's a vegan place for pete sake) and calming. Its layout reminds me a bit of a brighter version of Noodlehead with the large water jugs and seating arrangements.

It's a great place to hold a small to medium sized event, as you can book the whole restaurant. The service is great too. During the banquet, they were very accomodating and we even received table to table service from the servers!

The food comes out timely and is sooo good. If all vegan food tasted this way, I'd be willing to turn vegan no problem."}
{"text":"Don't worry about the vegan part. This place is one of the best 5 spots in Pittsburgh. DO IT."}
{"text":"This place is excellent.  I came here for dinner last week with a large group of friends. We basically ordered 2 of everything on the menu.  Everything was good but the highlights were (1) the mushroom pierogis; (2) the pumpkin and fennel seed soup; and (3) the oyster mushrooms with cabbage.  The cocktails are also excellent! (I had two frenets and scotch).

My only real critique is that all of the dishes came out at once which was a little overwhelming.  I would have liked the waiter to tell us to stagger our order so that things came out in courses.  Otherwise this place is perfect!"}
{"text":"My favorite new restaurant anywhere in the United States. Each experience has been blessedly pleasant at Apteka.  the food is absolutely brilliant. The staff is great. The first time I went, It took me 5 seconds to readjust my expectations to what dining out could be. I literally don't want to eat out anywhere else now. It's a tiny miracle that the place exists and it's gratifying to see they have been successful so far. It feels Like they won't sit still and it's exciting to imagine where they might take their cuisine from here. Bravi to everyone involved."}
{"text":"Have to admit, the vegan scene here in Pittsburgh is really starting to mature and to come off the ground. It's really quite nice to be a part of such a healthy food movement that's been taking the city by craze & Apteka is no different. A vegan establishment in the Bloomfield area near Children's, this is a great place to go for some great tasting vegan food, snacks, drinks, and a good time at the bar (if that's your thing lol). Tried the Kartofle z jogurtem (a Polish-inspired yogurt appetizer) and I was surprised at the rather novel but delightful combination of sweet & savory with the potato & apple in the same dish. The yogurt smoothed both flavors out & made things interesting. However, I would really write home about the pierogis, which are absolutely bomb here. The dish has a combo of sauerkraut + mushroom along with celeriac + apple + potato + horseradish pierogis, but I'd have to say that the sauerkraut + mushroom is the better of the two, though both are equally great-tasting (only my preference, take my opinion with a grain of salt). There are also lots of alcohol choices available at the bar (wine & beer). Don't be afraid to ask the bartenders what you're looking for in your drink as they are quite knowledgeable, friendly, and willing to help. In general, a lovely addition of a restaurant to Bloomfield. Would highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian, but I was pleasantly surprised this place. The food is wonderful, and the bartenders are quite crafty!"}
{"text":"Love this place.   Pierogi are fantastic. The cocktails are great and the food is delicious. I've converted my meat obsessed boyfriend and he loves everything.  Good service and food comes out quickly."}
{"text":"Wow - astonishing experience. I reserve 5-star reviews for life-changing experiences, and maybe give 1 a year on average. For creativity, quality, vibe, service, uniqueness, and modest prices, Apteka is right there. I really didn't believe the Pgh foodie thing was real till my meal was served here. The full menu and the beer reflect this standard. There are professional reviews out there, and I won't try to replicate them. My advice is simple: go here."}
{"text":"even though Polish cuisine will always include a lot of meat this Polish inspired began food is surprisingly tasty! especially home made bread and delicious kanapki."}
{"text":"I am not even vegan, but if I could eat here everyday I am happy to convert to veganism. Everything we ordered was flavorful. I love the unique combinations of flavors and quality ingredients. My favorite dish is Boczniaki z kapusta (oyster mushroom, cabbages, and butternut miso). I love it so much that I ordered a second plate. The Kluski Slaskie (potato dumplings in carrot broth) is also not to be missed. The price point is reasonable, and I love the ambience of the restaurant. I will definitely come back next time I visit Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Avoid the \"Kartofle z jogurtem migdalowym;\" it is not good. Get the perogies and ask for just the potato. They are excellent. The smoky flavor comes through in the perfect amount."}
{"text":"This place is bizarre. What's with the huge curtain upon entry that serves no purpose and is just in the way of the line of people ordering. The service? Totally unengaging, unfriendly, and unhelpful. The system they have going on is completely unorganized and inefficient. I found the food very bland. And the atmosphere was what it is, an old car garage with new white paint. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"EDIT: STILL MY FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT. My boyfriend and I eat here at least twice a week. The late night menu is EVERYTHING. Their klasyk burger is to die for, the fries with the mayo is delicious, boyfriend still gets the special sandwich every time and he loves their perogies.


Tonight was my second time here with my boyfriend. The first time we were here we just came for dessert and shared an apple tart which was absolutely amazing! So we decided then that we would have to come back for dinner one of these nights, and tonight was the night! We ordered the special sandwich, the perogies and the second salad on the menu (can't remember the name but it had a 2 next to it.) Going into the night I was most excited about the perogies, but truthfully the special sandwich and the second salad stole the show! I love the type of bread that the sandwich is served on, and the yumminess inside of the sandwich had a perfect kick of spice to the flavor I will absolutely be ordering again. The salad had an amazing dill type dressing which made it so tasty! The perogies were still impressive and they had a nice crispiness to them :) we skipped out on dessert this time though since we ordered so much food; next time though :)"}
{"text":"Everyday I wake up regretting that I was born \"human.\" I traverse through this wasteland my kin have created and wish only I would return back to the ether I had been so cruelly sprung out of. I have tried to meditate on this existence, drink away all feeling(s), and obscure my brain waves with a myriad of drug cocktails both legal and illegal all with little to no affect on the misplacement I feel on this Earth. I even went to an optometrist only to have him inform me that my \"third eye\" was not a physical but rather a mental thing that must be opened. Either way the food here is really quite good."}
{"text":"Back in 2004 when I was a wanna be high school hipster type thing , I got in on the fashionable becoming a vegetarian trend. It ended up sticking until today. I've watched the trend ebb and flow, go to spots like quiet storm close. Then the era of wanna be food network chefs with luxury meats coming into Pittsburgh and bacon memes infiltrating my social media feed coincided with a slowdown in the vegan/vegetarian food culture.

That obnoxious intro is only to note that it's really cool to have a new hip trendy restaurant where I don't have to have an awkward 5 minute conversation with the waiter about how they can \"make any dish vegetarian.\" And it's pierogis. The food was incredible and reasonable. Not to mention it also had a great cocktail menu that was manageable in price.

So, if I can have a moderately cosmopolitan experience and eat vegan food without being at a place that doubles on selling eat more kale shirts and yoga mats on the side. Win win."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite of the new restaurants in Pittsburgh; the food and drinks are excellent, the atmosphere is effortlessly cool without being pretentious, and everything is extremely affordable."}
{"text":"This is one of the most interesting new restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Apteka serves Eastern European cuisine on Penn Ave near the hospital. 

A lifelong carnivore,  I can honestly imagine living on Apteka's vegan dishes happily.  The tastes are unique and the dishes well prepared.   Try the Tartines, three different spreads on thick seeded bread.  The bread is fantastic, one of the owners is a former baker at La Gourmandine Bakery and has brought his craft to Apteka. The Tartine toppings include carrot pate and radish pickle; leek, Apple and mint and celery, pickle, apple and dill.   All are culinary delights.  Other small plates include beet soup with celeriac toast; Kartofle (pictured) which features potatoes, apples, lingonberry jam (mmm) and yogurt; Belgian endive with pickled prune and beech and oyster mushrooms.   All are delicious.

Big plates include pierogis (a Pittsburgh staple, but these are among the best I have sampled), see pictures.  Four is enough for sampling.  Golabki is an interesting cabbage, buckwheat, roasted tomato and bay bolete dish.  I have not tried the sorrel salad but a friend described it as excellent.

Apteka also offers sandwiches,  try the horse and pepper (pictured) which includes a vegetable pate, horseradish slaw, pepper relish, black garlic butter and chilies on a roll.  They have a variety of interesting cocktails and an interesting beer list.  For a non-alcoholic drink try the birch water.

Under no circumstances should you skip the deserts.  If you are like me, and try the apple tart with dried fruit compote, you may never try the others, though the spiced gingerbread with poached pear and prune preserves may eventually catch a wandering eye.

The restaurant has caught quite a following in a few weeks since opening and for good reason.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Apteka is seriously all around the best vegan joint in the burgh. Great food, great drinks, greater staff."}
{"text":"Damn the food is great here. First time eating Polish food, let alone vegan Polish food. I'm vegan-friendly, attending with several vegans, and everything I had was stellar. The salad has an intense bite to the dressing. The vegan pierogies were tasty, and the red crumbled whatever that came with it added a slightly spicy bite; this was the top of an overall excellent meal. The special sandwich was tasty too although a logistical nightmare for sharing.

Staff was helpful, bringing glasses and extra plates when it became clear we were sharing everything.

I didn't try the soup. One member of our party had it and thought it was just okay.

Fast casual - you order and pay at the counter. 

Place is on the loud side.

Restrooms are openly transgender and non-binary friendly. The doors each have a sign saying only what fixtures are in each bathroom.

Definitely worth a trip across the city."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!  I am a meat-eater, and this restaurant teaches you how satisfying a plant diet can be.  The reason that I can't give this restaurant a 5-star rating, however, is because of its service, or lack thereof.  This is a gourmet restaurant with a service model based on McDonald's.  Thus, you must wait in line to order all of your food and beverages before you even sit down.  If you later want another drink, you must get up and go to the bar to get another.  You are forced to learn the menu on your feet and order quickly lest you anger the folks behind you.  My wife and I were really put off by this and almost walked out before getting to the one and only cashier to order.  (At least McDonald's has multiple cashiers.) Given that they do have servers, this all seemed so unnecessary and merely contemptuous of the customers."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in the city. The pierogis are unique and taste incredible; plus, they're 100% vegan without compromising the integrity and traditional flavors of the dish. They also are one of the only good spots that is open late. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant whether you're vegan/vegetarian or not..period. The only ones I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to would be picky eaters who like to stick with familiar flavors and textures. I absolutely loved the two cocktails I tried (tequila+wildflower+citrus and rum+juniper+draai laag)... way better than some fancier and more expensive restaurants I've reviewed. And the food.. oh my.. I had the Boczniaki z kapusta which is oyster mushroom + braised cabbage in beer broth + butternut miso + rye crumb and a small Zimowa salad which had porcini vin + pickled beet + roast turnip + pea shoots + mint toast. I must confess, nothing was familiar about the flavors and the textures and their combination. Even the greens in the salad were unique and not the kind you'd see in the average salad. But the melange was outstanding. I'd strongly recommend the salad. I was full by then but couldn't not try the pierogies. And that ended up being the best decision I took that day. Just look at the list of what goes into the pierogies - Sauerkraut + mushroom . Celeriac + apple + potato + horseradish. Not you're average joe pierogi for sure! Do not miss trying them. The only thing that was slightly annoying was that the ordering is cafe style..and that ends up being a bottleneck. I made the mistake of ordering my first drink.. then had to go back to stand in line to order my appetizer.. and then again for my second drink and entre.. and then AGAIN for the afterthought pierogi! The fact that the menu is full of lovely, exotic and unpronounceable dishes/ingredients and so everyone has several questions before ordering and contributes to the bottleneck in the line. So you might want to consider pulling up the menu on your phone (because the only copy is taped to the bar counter) and ordering all your food and drinks at once when you get to the counter. Slightly inconvenient.. but saves you the awkwardness of waiting in line for 15 minutes to order your next drink while your date is waiting at the table. But line or not, I'm definitely going back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This place makes me think it's possible to eat vegan everyday, deliciously. But then I remember these people have worked for years to perfect their craft. And it shows. 
The drinks were fantastic so of course that was a great start. Everyone who worked there was friendly. We had the specialty sandwiches and the veg pâté was delicious. We made a mess but it tasted great just the same."}
{"text":"I am in complete disbelief that such a great, unusual new restaurant has opened in Bloomfield. When a friend and I checked it out, we were VERY hungry, and had somewhat low expectations (sign looked a bit sketchy out front, we weren't sure if we even liked eastern European food). I could not have been more wrong! The interior has a hip, grungy vibe, that is reminiscent of the old country - a little eastern soviet blockade feel to it. The servers and bartenders are so cool, and if you're lucky, take a moment to chat with them. 

The concept is pretty cool - you order at the bar, cafeteria style, then pick a table. They bring you your drinks and food. The drinks are magnificent and the pricing is excellent for Pittsburgh (average drinks $6-9). I ordered a gin drink with citrus and celery salt which is now my favorite gin drink of all time. My buddy ordered a campari and vodka based concoction that was not too sweet, but tasted of freshly juiced black cherries.

We ordered the large plate of pierogies and the trio of open faced tartines. The bread on the open faced sandwiches was dark and crusty, clearly home-made, and reminded me inescapably of happy childhood days baking dark bread with my family. The toppings were great - one had chopped seasoned root vegetables, one was some sort of tapenade, and the final one was pickled radishes and cucumbers over another tomato tapenade. Each one was unique and delicious. Then came the pierogies. Utter. Perfection. They were fried, which gave the nicest crunch when you bit in. There are two types they make - sauerkraut and mushroom (a little spicy with pepper), and potato. Both were incredible, and had layers of flavor that made me want to order three more plates. Honestly, I would have never even known it was a vegan restaurant if I hadn't looked it up ahead of time. I never missed meat once, and barely noticed there was none present. 

After all of this food, we sadly didn't have any appetite for dessert. However, I am confident I'll be back. And soon! This place is heating up and I can only imagine that the sky will be the limit for them. 

Two pierogie covered thumbs up!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here. I've been here twice and found the food to be solid. It's Pittsburgh, so there are pierogi. The mushroom is my favorite of the two options (other is cabbage and potato). There is use of dill, so keep that in mind. It comes with a bit of cucumber and beets.

My go to is the boczniaki z kapusta because I love mushrooms. I've had it before, but on this occasion the rye was burnt on one side. Bummer. The oyster mushrooms were good and quite filling. Hubs got the special sandwich and ate every last bite.

The line to order is the bottleneck. There is one person taking orders because it's an order and sit spot. Not a problem, but the menu on the wall is difficult to read since it's vertical and you might not be able to read the bottom. Menus are also on the counter, not so helpful to those in the back of the line.

Overall, cute place, with fun vibe. There is a full bar, so that's a bonus. I'm very much a can do without meat kind of person whereas hubs doesn't get that. He suggested we go here. That's how legit it is."}
{"text":"Interesting concept and menu. This was my first time coming here. You order at the counter (which can take a while if they are busy) and then sit at the tables. Everything is Vegan, which isn't really my forte but a group of us from work wanted to try it. Ordering was a little hard because a lot of the items, I've never heard of or don't know how to pronounce. The staff was helpful in giving suggestions as well. There was another group in front of us that was in the same boat as well, so we weren't the only ones! I played it safe and went with the pierogis. I also sampled the Kluski Slaskie (potato dumplings), Placki ziemniaczane z paprika (potato pancakes), and Boczniaki z kapusta (mushroom and cabbage). Everything was tasty. The mushroom pierogis were spicy, which I wasn't expecting but still enjoyed them. Everything else was good and flavorful as well. I feel you have to have a certain palate for this kind of food though. A lot of the ingredients I'm not familiar with or don't really like. But I'm glad I tried it. I wouldn't come here all the time but it's something different."}
{"text":"Apteka is very cool. A casual and hip eatery that is definitely a great addition to the Bloomfield neighborhood.

I came here with a friend who was visiting and was excited to try vegan central/eastern European food. We split the kanapki - which were each very good but I have to say the standout one was definitely the carrot pate. 

For our meals, I had the pierogies. These were really good although I wish the different flavors were more distinct. Either way, each of them came out hot and flavorful. My friend had the Horse and Pepper which she raved about!

The drinks were good here too and all priced below $10!

If I had to pick a must-try, it would have to be the carrot pate kanapki. All in all, this place is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Highly creative vegan food

Loved the roasted carrot tart is and oyster mushrooms

Soups were amazing

Very well prepared eclectic food and drink 

Dining room is simple and unimpressive 

Sandwiches superb ."}
{"text":"We ended up going back here a few times while visiting Pittsburgh. My partner is vegan and loved it. It was pretty packed every time we went, which I think is a good sign.

I thought the pierogi options were great and both times got an order to go to take back to the place we were staying. I thought the Cykoria I Sliwki had way too much pickled prune on the plate. The endive and beech & oyster mushrooms were good but I would have rather gotten a lot less pickled prune, a little more thyme oil and a piece of bread.

Speaking of bread, the slice that came with the Golabki was great and actually would have liked a little more to dip into the roast tomato sauce. I enjoyed the cabbage and buckwheat roll and everything tasted like it went together very well."}
{"text":"I do not understand how ANY review of this place is less than 5 stars!?!??  By far my favorite spot in Pittsburgh... and not just because I'm vegan!   
The food is incredible. 
The atmosphere is addicting. 
The staff is beyond friendly. 
I come here often, and often I am alone.  The staff always makes me feel welcome. 
The guy you order from at the front is maybe one of the best customer service experiences I've ever had. EVERY TIME!  His consistency with every customer is so impressive.  He knows the menu and guides you through the experience so well.  Their head bartender is a wizard.  Because I am often alone here, I get lost watching the operation flow.  It always amazes me how seamless they operate this very tiny restaurant. 

If you are vegan, this is a must. 
If you are not a vegan, still a must! 
This place has stolen my heart and not just because of their food.  I just enjoy being here!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here on a Sunday night, and while it was busy, finding a table was not a problem and the service was still good. The ordering line is located right in front of the entrance, so this might be inconvenient when it's super busy. The cashier explained how seating, ordering extra food, paying the bill, etc. works without us even asking. To reiterate what others have said, you take your number to where you want to sit, if you want to order an extra drink/food you can order at the bar or ask one of the servers when they walk around. The bathroom is locates behind a curtain right after the bar. I really liked the simple, clean aesthetic, and when it gets darker, the tables are backlit with lighting by the floor which created a nice atmosphere.

The food came out quickly, and we had ordered a large plate of pierogies, kanapki, and Piernik dessert (the perfect amount for 2 people to split). The pepper soda was also delicious-slightly sweet with a peppery aftertaste. We both were really pleased with the variety of flavors and portions and completely full at the end of the meal. I wasn't blown away by the food, but I think it's something unique in Pittsburgh. I'm interested in trying their other offerings, but I think you could pass on the piernik. It was good but not great. All in all, a really solid vegan restaurant that I think most people will enjoy."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. A great place to take a date or family and friends visiting from out of town. The food is incredible, and the cocktails are just as good if a bit pricey. Vegans rejoice."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place.  Awesome to see such a unique, tasty, and gourmet vegan spot in town.  Loved the Baba Jaga sandwich, tartines, and of course the perogies. Cocktails are great, too. Super
cool vibe and looking forward the outside space in the warm weather."}
{"text":"Brought a group of visitors here for dinner. They were very skeptical and very pleasantly surprised! 

We managed somehow to get a reservation, which is good because ordinarily the seating process here stresses me out. I was also able to keep a tab open, which saved us from having to get back in line when we ordered more things.

We ordered some of everything except the soups and shared it all family style. Here were our favorites:
Baba Jaga
Boczniaki z kapusta
Pierogi

The Boczniaki z kapusta in particular was well-liked - I couldn't believe I wasn't eating meat. It has a very rich, savory flavor.

We also enjoyed several of the cocktails, which are decently strong and reasonably priced.

Overall the whole meal was a success!"}
{"text":"I know what you are thinking, vegan Polish food? But rest assured this is some of the tastiest food I've ever eaten-vegan or not. The menu rotates a bit seasonally, but the tartines and pierogis are always a stellar option."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of the food being Vegan - would it be filling?  but the food was absolutely delicious - we got several dishes to share.  The flavors were amazing and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Never have I been to a place that changed my perspective on vegan fare quite like Apteka. 

We stumbled across this restaurant with some friends on a Monday night and there was already a line our the door about 9 PM. This place does not look like much from the outside but the interior is very relaxed, dimly lit and an intimate atmosphere for share plates and drinks I've never heard of. Instead of waiting in the line to be sat, we met someone pretty cool to share a table with that led to great conversation and a good night!

There was a live DJ at one of the tables playing some low-key background music but it was a nice touch.

But the real highlight of Apteka was the amazing food! Lots of good options and all delicious. Nothing lacks flavor and the pierogi's were the best vegan plate I've had! You'd be missing out if you didn't try some. YUM, I'll be back but check it out if you find yourself out this way!"}
{"text":"Get there early so you get a seat. You order at the counter which can be slightly intimidating. The cashiers are extremely helpful in describing the foods. The food combinations seem odd at first but taste surprisingly wonderful. My favorites are the special sandwich and the baba jaga. Everything is yummy though! Also a positive is that most of the foods seem pretty healthy. Sizes are substatial/filling. Atmosphere is trendy/hipster. Reminds me of some of the European places visited by Anthony Bourdain. Definitely give this place a shot and be open minded about the dishes. Good to sample a few all at once!"}
{"text":"Neither my husband nor I are vegans, but I enjoy Eastern European food, so I wanted to try this restaurant. Around 6 PM on a Friday, we found a free parking spot on the street, and we entered the busy restaurant and asked for a table. They encourage you to order at the front rather than the table and to pay before the food arrives. I give the kanapki sandwiches 3 stars because I enjoyed the taste of two of the three of them. I give the barszcz 4 stars because of the strong beet-tasting broth, but I prefer some solids in my borscht. I give the pierogi 3 stars because I could not determine which flavor was which until I cut into them, and I liked the sauerkraut and mushroom flavor more than I liked the potato, parsnip, and turnip greens flavor. I give the golabki 3 stars because of the buckwheat filling. The total bill was ~$40 total including tip. The cashier/waitress was nice. No drink refills for the flower-flavored soda or the water were offered, but we were OK. We will not return to this restaurant, but I encourage you to try this restaurant if you are a vegan and enjoy Eastern European food."}
{"text":"I guess when you're a vegan restaurant it's important that people know you're a vegan restaurant.  You know...so the vegans know how to find you.  And...bear with me here...that makes sense.  But Apteka isn't a good vegan restaurant.  Or...perhaps it's more accurate to say instead, Apteka isn't JUST a good VEGAN restaurant.  It's a good restaurant.  Yeah...there's no meat on the menu.  Or...you know...dairy or eggs or fish and stuff. 

So I suppose if you're dining with someone that REQUIRES meat.  Like...like Count Dracula for example.  If you and the Count are dining, this is a bad selection.  But apart from Count Dracula, or other people...like those too hidebound to attempt something with the \"Vegan\" label...this is a good restaurant.  No additional qualifiers required.

Secondly...I sampled four cocktails from their bar.  All from the menu (before you think, ugh, Jesus, Jim, not another drunk review...one of the drinks was just a taste of my date's drink).  And they were each better than the last.  REALLY well balanced nicely thought out drinks.  Can't really go wrong.  

The pierogies were excellent.  The tartines were superb.  The Boczniaki z kapusta was good, not great...the cabbage was a little clunky to eat.  It resisted my efforts to cut it into mouthful sized pieces.  The flavors were nice though.  We capped our evening with the \"special sandwich\".  We just saw it pass our table too many times not to give it a try.  It didn't disappoint.

Our server was a menacing looking fellow all betatted and armful with a perpetual scowl.  Which sounds like a bad thing, but if you asked him a question he would just light up like a kid at christmas and tell you ALL THE THINGS, beaming and gushing and very knowledgable and the contrast was so friggin' delightful that I kept asking him stuff to watch him transform over and over from menacing to kid-at-christmas and back again.

Probably the biggest criticism I have to the place is that it's lit in a way that is not conducive to artful pictures.  You know we MUST have pictures of our food.  And no matter which way we positioned glasses or seats or plates...there was always some weird shadow.  

Work on it, Apteka.  The people must post.

Anyway...I'll be back.  Meat or no meat."}
{"text":"I was recently here for my first visit. I ate Salatka 1(salad with burnt carrots, sunflower seeds, smoked chili, onion) and Pierogis(minus the sauce because I'm weird about sauces but my friends ordered them with the sauce and found it to be delicious), and I also had their gin cocktail. 

I have no complaints about their food. Each item tasted fresh, all the ingredients balanced each other well, and I would order each item again. My gin cocktail was equally delicious. I sipped it slowly not to take away from experiencing each flavor of my meal. This drink was so well crafted I found myself saying it is one of the best cocktails I've ever ordered between places in other US states and countries where I have dined. 

I plan to return and am hoping for the same experience. My friends have eaten here a couple times and commented to me saying each time they have been delightfully pleased. 

Last but not least, service was prompt and professional. Even though you order at the counter, it doesn't take away from having your food and drinks brought to your table in a timely manner and their servers remembering to check on you."}
{"text":"Had a dinner party here with a large group for a Birthday.  Claire helped me set up a family style dinner where we were brought out a mix from the menu so everyone got to try everything.  The food was excellent as well as the service.  They were very helpful in accommodating our large group.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I don't think I am hipster enough for this restaurant.  I have never in my life seen so many beanies and large framed glasses.  That being said, the food is delicious even though I have no idea what I ate because I couldn't read anything on the menu.  It is really cool that they were able to make vegan Polish food taste so good.  I would definitely come back just because the food was delicious.  They also have lots of different Polish beers on tap."}
{"text":"Love the food, the atmosphere, and the cocktails!  Probably the best food I have had in Pittsburgh. The chef is has a genius understanding of how to marry flavors.  The staff is very friendly and they have done such a great job with the space.  Highly highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing food... fun environment. Always worth the wait. After you order your food it doesn't take very long for it to come out to you so waiting for a table has never been a problem for me."}
{"text":"I'm a meat lover, so when one of my vegetarian friends recommended me to check out this \"vegan place in Lawrenceville\", I smiled, but didn't seriously consider it. It wasn't until I heard my foodie friends and fellow meat lovers gush about this restaurant time and time again, that I knew I had to give it a try. And I'm really happy I did.
I've been going to Apteka consistently over the last year, and one of the plates I keep ordering time and time again is the Baba Jaga. Simply put, it's a sandwich with beets, pickles and some other veggie goodness. I personally have always hated beets - I never liked their intense red color and flavor. But for some reason, the beets didn't taste like beets to me at all. I can say the same thing about many of their other dishes - they prepare the vegetables in such a way that their flavor and textures are truly transformed into something that you probably have never tasted before. Suddenly, you're forgetting that you're getting your healthy dose of veggies (and all for a very reasonable price)! Other dishes I recommend are their potato pancakes, pierogis, and panapkis. As for drinks, I love the Becherovka (I get it every time), but their Scotch Fernet cocktail is also really good."}
{"text":"Probably the tastiest vegan food in Pittsburgh. Pierogi were the obvious highlight, the smoked potato and parsnip being especially noteworthy. We also got a giant salad full of herbs and baby kale with tasty homemade bread on the side. The food is seasoned so well you do not miss the butter! 

Only drawback was the difficulty in reading the menu, which is posted pretty close to the door. A few paper copies to pick and read while you wait in line to order would be helpful."}
{"text":"Food: Excellent. From the entree to desert, they did a fabulous job of making some healthy and tasty vegetable dishes.

Service: Good. Everyone were pretty friendly, you have to order at the front desk and the food is brought out to you.

Overall: Based on prices, quality and service, I would highly recommend this spot if you're in the Burgh."}
{"text":"I came here at exactly 5 after hearing how crowded it can get.  I had both of my baby boomer parents who were slightly lost by the menu.  They had the baba jaga sandwiches, I had the borscht and we split the big plate of pierogi.  The cup of borscht was small but truly excellent.  The pierogi was great and my parents enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"So happy that Apteka finally opened their doors. They definitely did not disappoint.  Nice relaxed and minimalistic atmosphere.  Pierogis were definitely the highlight.  Was told that they will be rotating types of pierogis in the future.  The borscht was very good, a seemingly simple broth with a nice complex flavor.  They make an awesome hot pepper oil/sauce too.  Everything I've tried so far has been great.  Hope that they will expand their menu in the future.  Make sure to try a cocktail too!"}
{"text":"I actually feel bad even writing this, because I was really excited initially. We walked in to an extremely confusing layout. We stood in the doorway for a while and nothing happened and then went up to the counter as a line formed behind us. The girl taking orders was just as confused as us and asked us what we wanted but we were trying to get a table and she just took the next person in line instead of giving us a number. She must have been brand new. So we went to the back of the line and waited again. We ordered, paid, and realized that there were no seats! We walked over to the bar and a couple happened to be getting up, so we sat down. They never took away the drinks and checks from the previous couple. We got our food pretty soon after we ordered, both appetizers and main courses at once. The food was very bitter to the point where it was actually spicy and burning my mouth. We packaged it up and left soon after we started eating. It tasted better in the car, but I was really disappointed as a whole with the experience."}
{"text":"Takes vegetarian to a whole new level!  The food is terrific with a good menu option. This is as casual as it gets, with ordering at the counter and then it's brought up you. However, first time I was there, it was a hot humid evening and the fans were of little help"}
{"text":"Fantastic food in a lively and fun minimalist-inspired environment. Thoroughly enjoyed my pierogies and kanapki, and my wife and I split an apple tart that was easily one of the best desserts I have ever had. Amazing and innovative cocktails. When we went I got the Riga balsam cocktail, which was probably the best mixed drink I've ever had, as well. I highly recommend that if it is still on the menu when you visit. My only complaint is that it was a little frustrating ordering at the counter. The place seems busy and fancy enough to justify not having customers order at the counter, at least for dinner service. Overall, though, 4.5/5 stars. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The salad... I rave about the salad and I give them 5 stars for just the salad.
My friend and I shared a total of four dishes. The only ones I recall is perogies and salad, I also remember killing my low carb diet by eating the sliced bread. 
The drinks are very tasty but a little in the upper end in cost. 
I didn't know what to expect, to be honest. But I was attracted by the small and vegan menu. 
I tried so hard getting the recipe for the salad dressing from the friendly staff. No luck, but I have ideas. 
Will definitely go back next time I get a loan for the drinks."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in pittsburgh. Have lived here for 26 years and eaten all over. I went with 6 people, had great service, and ordered essentially everything on the menu. All of the food was so delicious that the price shouldn't even matter, but the price is great too! Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Apteka and will definitely be back! I'm so surprised and happy has a place like this. It's all vegan and very trendy. Priced well too. You order at the bar when you come in like a cafe then they bring the food to you. Staff was friendly and food came quick. The pirogies were delicious."}
{"text":"This place was packed shortly after it opened for the day on a Saturday.  The food was delicious, particularly the pierogi. The drinks were also phenomenal, and the service was very friendly.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite flavorful places in Pittsburgh restaurants. Enjoyed eating lots of flavorful dishes with my close friends. Would definitely recommend for the vibe of the atmosphere and excellent unique dishes."}
{"text":"I love this place. I wouldn't normally assume vegan polish food to be this amazing. The flavors blow me away. It also feels like I'm eating healthy wholesome food but at the same time comfort food. You can't skip the pierogies. I also had the appetizer with yogurt, potato and berry? It was surprisingly incredible."}
{"text":"I visited this place twice while visiting from California.  I loved the drinks!  They were creative and refreshing and there were some great options for those of us who love fruity and sweet drinks.  The atmosphere was fun and relaxed and the bartender was nice.  I didn't try much food but what I did try was delicious.  I'm not a vegan, but I can appreciate a vegan cuisine from time to time.  If I lived in the area, I'd definitely visit this place often!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was not excited when I first heard about a vegan Polish restaurant, but the food and atmosphere at Apteka blew me out of the water. 

First impressions were great: cozy, modern ambience bathed in warm light and a great sunny area in the back. Courteous cashier and attentive wait staff.

We were happily basking in the ambience when the food came: 
* a mushroom, dill and chive soup with mushroom dumplings
* 2 kinds of grilled crisp pierogis: one stuffed with potato/kale, and the other with mushrooms
* potato dumplings in a thick spicy carrot sauce 
* 3 tartines: mushroom, beet, and pickled cabbage
* sandwich with some kind of crispy nut patty, beets, caramelized onion spread
* apple crisp

The food was incredibly flavorful and unique. The mushroom soup and dumplings was the standout dish: it was like the definition of umami. We finished every last drop of that awesome soup and chewy dumplings.

Any kind of dumplings here are spectacular: the crisp pierogis (both kinds) were bursting with flavor and tender textures, and the potato dumplings were super hyyge (wrong region of Europe, I know - i just can't think of another way to put it). 

And that apple crisp?! how the heck did they get it so flaky and crispy and buttery-tasting without adding any butter?

Apteka, can I teleport your restaurant to San Francisco?"}
{"text":"APTEKA is the best. The restaurant was super-accommodating to our large group; taking a reservation of 15 for a Friday night and provided table service (as opposed to ordering at the counter as they're set up to do). Our group had a wide range of tastes, and everyone LOVED APTEKA! The best option is to share a few of the entrees. The pierogies (especially the ones with smoked sweet potatoes), the endive, and the Kanapki were all hits with our side of the table. Thanks for hosting our group, APTEKA!"}
{"text":"My meal tonight was absolutely astounding. My partner and I shared the tartines (bread slathered with various vegan spreads) and the large tray of pierogis. I also tried the vodka cocktail and the tequila cocktail. Every bite and sip was a \"wow\" moment.

The staff working tonight were kind, patient, and totally kept their cool during the dinner rush.

I'm looking forward to the completion of the rear patio, which will open a full back wall of the restaurant. Additional seating will be a great benefit too!

Whether you're a vegan or not, do yourself a favor and check out Apteka!"}
{"text":"Guys I'm so confused. So confused. I like to think I'm a hip person who frequents gallery crawls and drinks red wine and decorates my house with tons of plants, but this was truly the most millennial thing I've ever done. And I thought I was super millennial. 

You walk in, are fronted with a huge wall menu, place your order, and sit. Anyone who has ever been to Gaucho (which def isn't Vegan) it's a very similar set up. That's cool I don't mind that. I've also have vegan food from other vegan restaurants and really enjoyed it (no I'm not vegan). 

We sat in the back room which I didn't realize was like a garage area till after, when I started to freeze. It was so cold in there. I did enjoy the vibe and happiness around and ambience with the lighting. 

The food: I ordered the pierogies and the potato pancakes. The potato pancakes were ok, but they were cold. Maybe they were supposed to be? The pierogies were good but I'm sorry I really don't think they're as amazing as everyone says they are. I liked the sauces and relishes with the dishes more than the actual dish. 

Maybe I'll be back? I kinda want this 5 star restaurant that everyone else is saying it is."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for dinner on a Saturday night around 7:15pm and the wait wasn't bad at all. Once we ordered, a table magically appeared for us. The process of ordering/ saving a table could have been more clear. Several people also waiting commented they didn't know the \"ordering/seating procedure.\"

The menu had a good bit to chose from and the variety was great. I wanted to order the pirogies but couldn't as I'm a person who doesn't like mushrooms and they were not able to separate the varieties -- bummer. I did order a sandwich with beets and it was a-m-a-z-i-n-g. That said, it was just the sandwich and I left still needing to eat more. I didn't realize it wouldn't come with at least a side salad for the $9 price tag. Even up the price to include a salad or side. 

The atmosphere was casual and great other than the smokiness that kept circulating the room. My jacket still smells. :("}
{"text":"Cool place--some of the reviews made it sound like it is pretentious (pretentious Polish food? ha!), but it is totally cool and the workers are happy to answer any questions you may have.  Mixed age/ethnicity diners, but yeah it is not super cheap.  I had not had polish food before, if you don't count some random borsht and cabbage rolls.  I had the pierogies and the kluski.  Very interesting and tasty!  Kluski comes with a mushed up bean puree kinda deal--good flavor.   Several cabbage type veggies on top, some bitter, some not.  Cute little dumplings that are fun to eat.  There were two kinds of pierogies in the 4 pack, but honestly, I wasn't really listening.  One was more peppery and had cabbage.  Other was more potato-y but also maybe had cabbage.  They came with some crema type stuff on top, cucumber pickles, and beet salad.  My favorite things were the pickles, beets, and beans.  I also had a fancy gin drink which was good but kinda just tasted like a tom collins.  Price was $29 for everything plus a tip for bartender.  Dinner plus ap was enough for 2 not so hungry people or one hungry person.    Would def return!"}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely amazing and it was all vegan! I didn't know how to pronounce anything on the menu, but the menu does a good job of explaining what is in every dish. The portions were good and the price wasn't too bad. Drinks are expensive and small, but they pack a punch, so it's definitely worth it. If you have a nut allergy, watch out bc a lot of the dishes have nuts. I let the staff know and they were very accommodating."}
{"text":"Apteka is easily one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. The food, drinks, and service are all amazing. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu, and it's all delicious and unique. Atmosphere is awesome, too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I'm eastern european and not at all vegan, and the food was absolutely delicious!  The menu is interesting, with lots of variety for larger groups, and the cocktails were excellent. The servers are nice, atmosphere is pleasant, cannot find a single thing to complain about :)  I've been back multiple times and will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I like this place. The atmosphere is pleasant, seating is nice. Good lighting, and the menu was interesting and different from most of what I've had before. I'm not vegan and enjoyed it.

Pierogis - great, yum. 

Potato dumplings in carrot broth with mushrooms - DELICIOUS I would recommend. I had never had this sort of texture of potato before, I was amazed. The broth is tasty and the mushrooms are extremely tasty

Salad with bread - didn't care for as much, but I'm not a big salad eater anyway. The spread on the bread tasted very medicinal, not my thing.

Overall, good experience. I would return."}
{"text":"Really unexpected is the best way to describe Apteka in my opinion. I arrived thinking it would be an upscale vegan spot with menus, sit down table service, a swanky bar and some description of the menu items before ordering....and nope Apteka is not really any of that! I felt as though I was dining in either a foreign country or Hawthorne in Portland maybe (it is that level of hip).

The menu is written on a large scroll in charcoal pencil with little to no info/context on what the heck you are ordering when you walk in. I am not picky so I didn't really mind this, but it definitely put the pressure on to make a game time decision with the massive line behind me. We ordered the special sandwich of the day which had caramelized apples and onions I think and was on a baguette, and the Baba Jaga (basically a ton of pickled things with grainy mustard, their veggie pate, and on homemade bread). For a beverage I got the tequila and wildflower. 

You grab a table number and snag a seat if there is one open! Luckily we got the last open table in front of the bar. I enjoyed the atmosphere of Apteka for the most part, although I felt it was a little too brightly lit for dinner time if I am being wildly picky. Otherwise I really liked the all white interior, with minimalistic decor and dried flowers and branches throughout. 

Our food and cocktails arrived, the drinks were strong and delicious and damnnn for $6 per cocktail? Insane bargain for the quality. The sandwiches were delicious and so, so filling. I could only eat about 1/2 my Baba Jaga. The homemade bread to me was the standout of my meal though I made the fatal flaw of not ordering the pierogies. Anyway back to the bread-- it was super dense, packed with all types of seeds and, crumbly yet sturdy, some of the best bread I have had in a while and coming from Philly, ya know that is some good bread!

We got the rest of our sandwiches to go, our bellies packed with enough fermented foods/probiotics to last us for about a week. I will absolutely be back and I will not miss the pierogies next time."}
{"text":"So amazing. Polish vegan food was something I never sought out to try but wow it did not disappoint.

Two entrees, dessert and cocktails split between me and a friend for $40. It as incredibly worth it. The service was friendly and great too. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Vegan Polish food, you say?  I was skeptical at first also, but the food was both interesting and flavorful and the drinks were amazing!  We wanted to try everything... but fell short.  A lot of smokey flavors when I was there, and apparently, something that I thought was sour cream... but wasn't:). One of my new favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"We used to go their pierogi nights- so glad they became an official restaurant! Their food is comforting, delicious and vegan!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and it's been absolutely amazing each time. The quality and flavors of the food and drinks here are outstanding. I would go as far to say that it's the best food I've had in Pittsburgh in the last couple of years. I could eat here everyday, seriously. The kanapki's are perfect little bites of vegan heaven. The carrot pate is out of this world and the homemade bread is killer! The pierogi are perfection. I've also sampled the potatoes and the salatka. The salad has a ton of fresh sorrel and dill with a nice sweet vinaigrette which I liked immensely with the addition of a little sea salt.

The drinks are yummy and reasonably priced. Birch water is the best non-alcoholic beverage ever! The cherry kihafa and lime is a good cocktail, not super strong but sweet and sour goodness. I had another vodka drink with burnt lemon sometimes else the first time I visited and it's lovely as well.

Sitting at the bar is really nice but the tables are fine and staff comes around and checks in even though you don't really have an actually server, it's more of a fast-casual set up but you can keep a tab open for drinks and extras. The place is modern yet a little homey, very comfortable and not overly done. The  only thing I don't care for is the heavy use of mass incense but it came and went. 

This place is must-try. I look forward to going here as often as possible."}
{"text":"Met with a group of friends on a busy (loud, crowded) Saturday night for dinner and drinks. Our table ordered pierogies, lima bean/potato dish (kluski slaske), latkes, salatke 2 (dill!), and baba jaga sandwiches, some to share, and some not. Everybody loved all the food. I thought the sear on the pierogies was a little strong, but the whole dish was such a delightful concatenation of textures and flavors that I didn't much notice. 4 is definitely plenty for one person; next time I might offer to share and get a second dish to share. I will say that the kluski slaske is not visually appealing, but I would definitely order it again, so warm and creamy was it. The Czech in me very much enjoyed my slivovitz cocktail. I would like to come back and treat myself to the rest of the list, starting with the bourbon."}
{"text":"Yup. Loved it.  Went with my meat-loving bf (I'm a vegetarian) and he loved it as well.  We got the Kanapki (favorite) and the Cykoria (also good but not nearly as good as the Kanapki).  The Salatka (the only salad on the menu) was the only item we considered not worth it, because it was just a salad of mixed greens with what appeared to be a few pieces of pickled potatoes.  The menu said it had shallots and apple but the dish we got didn't have those (unless that was like infused into the dressing or something?) also the salad's dressing was so spicy that we couldn't really eat it, I'm huge on spice but that amount of spice just concentrated on mixed greens wasn't great.  We also got the pierogies which were amazing.  My boyfriend got a cocktail with tequila and citrus and he loved it, I tried it as well and thought it was awesome. 

Overall would highly recommend to meat eaters and vegs alike, with the particular standouts of the meal being the Kanapki and the pierogies.  The only disappointment was the Salatka which I would not recommend due to the spice as well as the disappointing lack of ingredients considering it is nearly the same price as other much more complicated and hearty items on the menu.  Will definitely return.  

Ambiance is chill and casual cool.  Wait staff was very nice and attentive.  You order your food and then get a number and sit wherever you want and then the food comes to you that way, you don't have like a waiter to yourself.  This wasn't a problem and actually I liked it."}
{"text":"I was surprised by the high rating of this restaurant and my experience as it certainly was not the same. As a vegan I am always on the lookout for a wonderful vegan experience and this was unfortunately it. Let me break it down for you. 

Unlike a true upscale restaurant you order as you come in the door. The menu is written on table paper and pinned to the wall. After you order you have to walk around and find an available table. We were fortunate that we found one fairly quickly. 

Meals: bland. Because I am unfamiliar with the type of food Apteka serves I  ordered the 2nd dish on the large plates and had my partner order the peorogies. I was surprised that my meal was actually a salad. Why would I go to a vegan restaurant to order a salad when I can get that anywhere...this is what my friends said when my order came. The salad was good but not great.  My partner shared his meal with me but the sauce tasted sour so I didn't like it. 

Cons: I don't like ordering my dinner at a counter, grabbing my silverware and finding my own table in this type of restaurant. While the servers, or food runners, were pleasant they did not come back to check on you. 

Positives: the service and atmosphere. The food came quickly and the atmosphere was great although a little too dark for my liking. 

I am truly upset that I cannot support my community of vegans but this is not an establishment that I nor my friends would visit again. For a true pleasant vegan experience I'll go back to the Doublewide Grill."}
{"text":"I visited this place after it was featured by Eater.
Apteka has Eastern European cuisine, but it is difficult to understand what country is from.
Food was ok, but I expected more authentic taste and better cleanliness overall. Service was a little bit slow. More $$$ than $$"}
{"text":"SO OVERRATED! 

Okay, so I will stop shouting now. But seriously, I am missing out on what the thing is about this place. I am a vegetarian and looked forward to eating here, but the food and ambience both disappointed.

I had Kartofle and a Special Sandwich. The Kartofle was potatoes with lingonberries and some yogurt. It was fine, nothing special, a side dish that became my main course because...

The Special Sandwich was \"special\" in the way that means \"not good\". I think they were going for crusty baguette for the bread, but it was tooth-breaking levels of hard. Look, I bake bread, I know the difference between crusty and hard, and this was just hard, like it was stale or something. And the filling was bland and heavy, no discernible flavor.

I don't understand why they don't just have table service like every other restaurant in their price range. You come in and have to wait in a line that hits the door, so you're immediately not comfortable, you give your order to a person, and then you hope you find a seat, and maybe you don't sometimes? I was there on a Sunday so I didn't have an issue. We sat in the carport, which had appallingly bright lighting. Our table was sticky. We tried to clean it with water, but that didn't help. The benches were uncomfortable. It's like they want you to eat and leave fast (though nobody rushed us out; just the ambience screamed \"GET OUT OF HERE FAST\").

That said, my cocktail was just fine and the staff seemed friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Vibe was a little Uber hip for us, but the incredible, savory, delicious food was worth it. We got the daily toasts, pierogies, and special sandwich. The special sandwich was the most bomb of all, smoky and incredibly filling with mushrooms and cabbage galore. Everything was delicious. The cocktails were well-balanced and beautifully presented. Highly recommend for dinner. (But don't get the laurel tea-it tasted like hot water.)"}
{"text":"I have now been here twice and not eaten twice. The first time they told me the kitchen closed at 10pm, but when pressed for anywhere open after 10, I was told there was a pizza place a few miles away. So fucking helpful. 

This time, I walked in and didn't know the drill. Apparently you crowd in at the bar and order then sit. Except no one would meet my eye and explain that. Or seat me. Or tell me to sit anywhere. Instead the waitstaff actively looked away when I tried to ask them for water. I had to look on Yelp to find out that this place had you order at the bar. No one, NO ONE in this pretentious hipster bar could actually practice customer service.

Fuck that. I get better service in Bushwick."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night and it was booming with people, music, and a warm inviting atmosphere. 

We started with a small plate of Kanapki and moved onto a big plate of Pierogis andKluski Slaskie with an apple tart for dessert!  

You order at the front and find yourself a seat which was difficult with a big group on a Friday night, but the service was excellent and the food was a great experience.  There is also an option to make a reservation online for 6+ groups :).   Big flavors and friendly staff.  I want to go back again and try more on their menu!"}
{"text":"Incredible pierogies! Very chill, hip vegan place. Can't wait to continue to go back until I've tried everything on the menu. Very cool bar area as well for drinks or to sit at and dine."}
{"text":"Apteka is a unique restaurant featuring Eastern European vegan cuisine. As a carnivore, I can assure anyone with taste for good food, that they're culinary desires will  be satisfied. Despite the description of the cuisine, which might seem limiting -- there's actually a decent size menu that offers a variety of tastes and options that range from light to very filling. Remember that vegan doesn't mean gluten-free, so there's plenty of carbs available from dumplings in a delicious carrot broth (Kluski Slaskie) to pierogies with fun fillings to veggie sandwiches on rich bread. As a bonus, this casual and comfortable yet hip eatery is open late nights with a more limited, but still delicious menu. There's a full bar with some clever cocktails, craft beers and a small selection of interesting wines. Service is simple with ordering done at the counter just inside the front door, take your carafe of water and order number, choose a table and it won't be long before your picture perfect food arrives. Customer sitting at the bar can have an open tab, thus replicating full table service. The staff appears to be young and ambitious, taking pride in their craft."}
{"text":"Verdict: Neat vegan establishment with a solid menu and refreshing drinks.

+/-:
+ Casual, simple, hip atmosphere
+ Delicious food at more than reasonable prices

- The service was horribly slow, table service was non-existent; our food was brought out as it was ready which ended up in us receiving one dish at a time with anywhere from ten to forty five minutes between courses. I'm down with order-at-the-counter, but then the table service should be clean and deliberate.
- The staff weren't very welcoming or helpful; I wasn't sure how much or what to order and was met with some sarcasm and felt shamed after asking for some advice on our decision; after sitting down, we were told that a DJ would be coming soon and he would set up where we were sitting...we weren't asked to relocate, just asked to not be sitting there when he showed up?

With such a small place and in such high demand, it didn't really make sense to me why they had a DJ taking up table space to play some low-key weirdo music. The music was cool, though. I'll definitely be back to try again and see what kinds of tastes the rest of the menu works out."}
{"text":"AMAZING.  Vegan Polish food... who'd have thought?  This place is awesome, even for meat eaters.  I've been here 3 times and everything I've tried is delicious.  Everything is colorful and has amazing layers of flavor.  The cocktails are also great and unusual.  Oh, and save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Every single thing is perfect. The menu is much more exciting than a lot of veg places I've gone to before. I had 4 cocktails there and every single one was perfectly balanced. The food is creative and cooked well. You can really taste each ingredient, and can find layers of surprises throughout your meal. Everything was fun to eat. The staff is very casual, funny, and they act like real people instead of trying to dramatically smile and be over the top. I want to come back here and order every single thing they have to offer... and I will."}
{"text":"Restaurant is a inconspicuous brick flat on the outside, but screams hipster chic on the inside. You order at the counter from a paper menu on the wall. The food is brought to your table. The prices are very reasonable given my perceived quality of the food.

Compared to the few other vegan dining opportunities I've had in the past, the food here was a huge step up. From a personal enjoyment perspective, I don't think this was a enjoyable experience (Pierogi, Kluski Slaskie, and salad) at all due to the general blandness of the food. I just cannot get over how little I enjoyed the food here. Perhaps my subconscious carnivore was sabotaging my taste buds throughout the experience.

If you are vegan or a full time vegetarian, I doubt you'll find many places better and cooler than this. But if you are a career omnivore (or carnivore), I wouldn't consider this a destination restaurant for you."}
{"text":"Not too busy on a Thursday at 9 PM. I had the half salad with smoked chili vinaigrette and pierogies again (too good). I highly recommend this savory yet light salad. The sunflower seeds added a nice crunch and the burnt carrot lining the bowl complemented the dish well. I was scraping the sides to get it all! I also tried the gin, prosecco, pear, and hops cocktail. Delicious - not too strong nor too sweet."}
{"text":"An amazing experience- delicious food, portions are just right, staff are friendly and patient, seating was lovely. On top of all that, my children said it's their favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"On a cross country road trip and ended up here for the pierogis! Delicious. Good drinks and cool vibes too"}
{"text":"I am the literal definition of a carnivore, the kind that orders an extra steak or lambchop for dessert. Vegan or not, the meal I had last Friday was nothing short of amazing. The tartines were varied and savoury, the pierogi prepared two ways also distinct and worth going back for another plate of soon. Give it a shot, have a couple excellent cocktails and enjoy a well prepared meal in a fun space with some friends"}
{"text":"One of the most original vegan restaurants in the country, Apteka is about as Eastern European as a plant-based restaurant can get. Its menu features potatoes in just about every form a potato can enter your meal, from pierogis to soup, from pancakes to, yes, even the salad had boiled potatoes in it. But it was all worthwhile, well-cooked, and worth the wait--and that's the only bummer here, there can indeed be quite a wait. No reservations for parties under six. You order from the counter, and then, when you get your food, you just have to hope there's space to sit. So go early, or late. It's crowded because it's so good."}
{"text":"Full disclaimer: I'm not vegan.

However, I think good food is good food and I am willing to try anything once. I've heard a lot of great things about Apteka and see it recommended on many Pittsburgh \"late-night eats\" and \"best perogies\" lists. I just so happened to be craving perogies at 10pm on a Thursday night and decided to give it a try. I dragged my (also not a vegan) brother with me. The interior was warm and inviting on a cold November night. They definitely embraced the earthy elements with lots of floral and plants as decor. 

You order at the counter when you walk-in, we were working with the late night menu, which is a little more limited, so we both ordered the highly recommended perogies. My brother had a beer from a local brewery and I ordered a vodka cocktail. It was made with sunflower oil and some sort of flower (possibly a dandelion) floating in it. It was honestly one of the best vodka cocktails I've had in my life (my brother tasted and agreed). To be completely honest, I didn't eat the floating flower. 

Unpopular opinion... I just didn't get the hype. The perogies, had lots of flavor like people previously mentioned, I just can't say that I enjoyed the flavor. There appeared to be two different types of perogies one that was better (in my opinion) than the other. Menu says... Sauerkraut + mushroom . Celeriac + apple + potato + horseradish. The Mushroom perogies were definitely the ones I didn't like, they just had this overpowering shroom flavor that left an unpleasant almost \"dirt\" aftertaste.

Apparently if you're a vegan this food is amazing, I'm clearly not cut out for that life. Neither of us even finished our meals and it was about $40 for the two drinks and the perogies. I'd come back for another vodka cocktail, but I don't foresee any food orders in my future."}
{"text":"I love basically everything about this place.

Let's start with the food.  It is seriously, seriously delicious.  I know this has been said before, but even though Apteka is all vegan, you will NOT miss meat -- or even dairy.  I am a pretty big meat-lover and I thought every bite of the food was not only delicious but surprisingly packed with umami. I might even be so bold as to say that this is the best vegan restaurant I have ever been to in my life.

As the original flagship dish, the pierogis are not to be missed. The owners used to run the well-known pop-up pierogi nights!  The sauerkraut and mushroom one, in particular, is to die for, and the yogurt-mustard sauce is so tasty you won't want to waste a single drop.

I also love the kanapki (toppings change seasonally, I think) and the endive/mushroom dish. As I mentioned, none of these dishes are lacking in umami in the slightest, despite being vegan.

The cocktails are inventive and VERY fairly priced at $6-8, aka nearly half the prices you'd find at a craft cocktail bar. I love their incorporation of pickled flavors in both their cocktails and food alike. The bourbon, pickled prune, and sage cocktail is a good choice if you love a sour drink.

To top it all off, the atmosphere is tops -- hip yet casual -- and the service is friendly. You order at the counter, get a number, find first-come/first-serve seating, and they bring you your food. Personally, my favorite spot is at the bar where you can watch the cocktail mixing magic happen!"}
{"text":"Food is quite good, particularly for what it is. What I do not quite understand, however, is their service. They've a large and I imagine knowledgeable staff, but their counter-side ordering approach of all courses and drinks at once seems to take advantage of neither. The result is mostly a long queue and then food / drink being delivered without much explanation or a reference point (and all at once). 

I'd like to go back and see it all again, and see how often the menu changes. It was good but I'd very much like to see a change in their service approach. 

Just my preference, though, for non-byob establishments."}
{"text":"Very neat spot. Light and airy; small and quiet. Nice music. Good vegan food and unique cocktails. The staff is nice and friendly. Very relaxing"}
{"text":"Sooo good! Vegetarian, Polish food? Wow! I am hungry just think about it. Got Baba Jaga canapés and pierogi dish - mouthwatering. Great job!"}
{"text":"The food is decent- a slightly bizarre vegan take on Eastern European/Polish food. Had the Baba Gaga which was down the middle. The pickled beets and dill were top notch. The veggie patty and bread were both a little too thick/dense and I ended up deconstructing it and skipping the second half bread. 

My friends got the perogis and they looked tight but I was too full focusing on my sandwich to try them.

The real winners are the cocktails! Innovative and cheap- at least by the East Coast high priced standards I am used to- my friend told me this joint actually is considered pricey by Yinz standards. Such a sweet Hobbiton place Pittsburgh is- love you!

I had the bourbon poppyseed \"milk\"- fantastic! In fact I had three.

Cool innovative vegan food and drinks for the masses."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the Unblurred or First Fridays on Penn. After watching the weather all day we decided, \"Hooray, no rain\", and made our way out into the neighborhood. After walking up and down Penn Ave and seeing some great art and listening to some music we needed some food. There are not a ton of places to eat up on Penn Ave, but the ones that are there are always so good that it makes it hard to pick one. I for one have never been to Apteka and have been eyeing it up for some time. Since we were close and it was an easy walk I was able to get us to go there. Right when we walked in it was busy, but the server told us the food comes out really fast and the turnover for tables is very fast too. By the time we ordered we already had a table, she was not kidding. We asked her opinions on some of the dishes, just because it was a bit overwhelming to look at the wall menu and then the littler menu by the counter. We finally settled on a small plate, two large ones, and a dessert. Very exciting stuff. The decor is simple and very nice. The tables were close together but the diners are friendly and we even chatted a bit with our neighbors to the right. They were long time Apteka customers and had lots of suggestions for the next time we visited. I like places where you feel that the customer base is so nice that it is easier to sit so close because it is friendly. 

Small Plates: 
Boczniaki z kapusta: oyster mushroom + braised cabbage in beer broth + butternut miso + rye crumb. OK. This was our favorite dish out of all the ones that we tried. My goodness. The butternut miso was fantastic. It was so good that we dipped some pierogies in in, some of our other bread in it, and just scrapped the plate. It was a really nice mix of flavors and blended so well. I would get this again for sure. 

Big Plates:
Pierogi: Z kapusta i grzybami / seler z jablkiem i ziemniakami i chrzanem: Sauerkraut + mushroom . Celeriac + apple + potato + horseradish. Honestly, I did not like all of the flavors of the pierogies as much as I expected too. I think that the sauerkraut and mushroom was the only one that I really truly liked. It came with a side of greens, some turnips, and I believe some crushed nuts. The greens were fantastic, the turnips were good, and the pierogies, they were ok. I liked the dough, I liked the presentation, I would have just preferred the one flavor over any of the others. 

Special Sandwich: Veg pate + smoked apple and chilis + red cabbage slaw + salt pickled turnip + savory sauce. This was my dish and I really enjoyed it. I would have liked a bit more of the savory sauce because it was so good! I think that it was the smoked apple, but wowza, what an amazing flavor. Next time I would ask for the sandwich to be cut in half. I had a hard time cutting it and it was a bit bigger so it was easier to handle in two pieces. But because of the fresh bread and only having a butter knife it was a little messy to cut into two. I thought that the veg pate, something that I have never tried or thought about was really great. I was surprised how much I really enjoyed this meal. 

Dessert:
Tarta jablkowa: Tarta jablkowa z sosem z suszonych owocow. Apple tart + dried fruit compote. Again. YUM. This was a nice end to the meal for sure. The tart was crisp and the fruit on the top was delicious. I enjoyed the little drizzle of fruit something on it too. I would suggest ending the meal with this treat. 

The place was beautiful, the service was fast and friendly, and the food was great. I cannot wait to come back. I am so happy to be able to come here on such a fun Friday night. It really made the start of the weekend so much better."}
{"text":"Great food.  Nice drinks.  Sweet staff.  Great, minimal decor.  Awesome music.   Love it."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time and it was really good so many different options I'm not vegan but the food is really tasted good !!"}
{"text":"I've had almost everything on this menu and it's all amazing! I love both sandwiches and the braised oyster mushroom dish is out of this world. Ask for suggestions but you can't go wrong. Good place to order a few items and split them."}
{"text":"Oh Apteka. The little wonderful vegan heaven that is tucked away in Bloomfield. Apteka is Central & Eastern European themed. Anyone who knows me, knows that I am obsessed with most European food so this is a great spot for me when I just happen to pass through Bloomfield.  It honestly surprises me just how great this place is (I am a carnivore for life). But honestly, I could eat here all the time and not even think twice about it. 

Lets start with the fact that I can't pronounce 99% of the menu (but I always have a waiter that is patient with me and we usually end up having a few laughs over why crazy pronunciations). And while we are on the topic of waiters, my service has always been excellent. My food always comes out in an ample amount of time and they always seem glad to help if i have any questions. 

We usually tend to get the big plates to share. My favorite is the Pierogi ( one has mushroom and sauerkraut, the other has apple, potato and horseradish).  Oh My Gosh. These have a flavor that you have never experienced before. And definitely not like any other piergoi you would find around here!

We also never leave without grabbing dessert. We almost always go for the Apple tart with a dried fruit compote. It is such a great combo. Was defiantly a wonderful surprise to my palate. 
If you are anywhere near Bloomfied, I absolutely recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"Once again I'm venturing off into the world of vegan dining! Apteka definitely met all of my expectations and then some with their Eastern European flare and food that was filled with flavor!  My friend and I decided to order two small plates and then an order of pierogis to share.  As a first timer I wanted to try everything on the menu, which admittedly took some time to decipher.  The pierogies were outrageously delicious...and Pittsburghers beware...these are NOT Mrs. T's...consider your pierogi game upgraded when you leave Apteka!  Filled with sauerkraut and mushroom, or the celeriac, apple, potato, and horseradish, and plated with some mustard greens and black radishes, I found myself consciously eating slowly just so I could savor each bite and not finish too quickly!   The serving of seven was the perfect amount to share between the two of us.  We both got the same small plate, which was a combination of beer braised cabbage with just enough char to really get that \"grilled\" flavor, and oyster mushrooms in a decadent butternut miso...I almost asked for bread to be sure and soak up every drop!  

The food here definitely deserves 5 stars.  My only regret is that because you order at the counter, and it's clearly a popular spot, if you don't get everything you want right off the bat, you could be spending some time in line if you try to go back.  We considered dessert but ended up passing just because we didn't want to wait.  The menu is unique and I can't wait to return and try other things...oh and arrive early because by 6:30 it was packed and there are no reservations for parties smaller than 6.  This place is definitely worth the hype!"}
{"text":"I have been eager to try this place after seeing all the rave reviews. My friends and I went on a Friday and surprisingly the line was not too bad. We ordered the pierogies, kluski slaski, and salatka. They have a decent amount of seating, so don't be alarmed by the lime. The restaurant interior has a really nice hip vibe with lots of fresh flowers. 

The kluski slaski, which were the potato dumplings, were very good. The sauce they were in was very flavorful and made the dish. The potato dumplings alone were bland, but all the elements of the meaty mushrooms, cool dill sauce, and warm broth made an excellent bite. The pierogies were also delicious. Their dough was the perfect consistency. The salad was also an interesting mix as it had potatoes and fennel in it. 

Overall, each dish was satisfying and you could never once tell they were vegan. Beware though, if you do not like dill steer clear of Apteka. Every dish had dill in it. Their prices are also very reasonable. A good option for vegans and vegetarians! We need to see more restaurants like this in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!

First off, the decorations inside are very relaxing - all white and light everywhere. There is a carport in the back that was converted to a dining room and a pretty sizable garden in the back with seats. You can order at the front counter or at the bar (once you've made your initial order at the front counter). My friend and I split a number of dishes and they were all SO GOOD.

We started with the Kanapki which is esentially a few different spreads on toast. My favorite of these was the roast carrot pure which was so delicious!!

Then we moved onto the Boczniaki z kapusta which was beer braised cabbage with butternut miso and rye crumb. OMG that butternut miso was SO GOOD, we were practically licking the plate. That whole dish was probably my favorite.

Next was the Salatka with smoked chilli, burnt carrot, sunflower shoots, and burnt sunflower seeds. I had no idea that so many burnt things could add up to such a delicious dish. I guess I need to burn my food more often. 

For dessert we split both the apple tart and the yogurt bilberry. The yogurt was made of cashews! I've never tried nut yogurt before so this was really exciting! I liked both dishes a lot though the apple tart I liked more. We also each got a fancy soda (I had the wildflower soda and my friend had the poppy seed soda).

After all that each of us only paid $22! Such a deal for such an amazing meal! I will definitely be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Though this is a vegan place (and I'm not vegan), I am a big fan! I've had the pierogies (SO GOOD) and the kanapki, along with a handful of their cocktails and wine. The menu might seem intimidating but fear not - the employees here are happy to explain and answer questions. Always a hoppin' place in the evenings so you may have to wait a few minutes to snag a table, but that just gives you extra time to enjoy one of their cool drinks! Street parking is relatively easy on penn Ave in this area. Definitely will return to Apteka."}
{"text":"I love settling in at a restaurant for a nice meal, but sometimes I want awesome food (and Apteka's dishes with brilliant flavors are certainly that) but I'm short on time. Many people have kids, after-work commitments, a dog in the car, whatever, but still want delicious vegan food, in a city that doesn't have a ton of vegan options.

At most restaurants, there's a thing called \"take out\" - novel concept, I know - where you can call ahead and pick up your order. Apteka disallows this. You can place a takeout order, but only if you're physically present at Apteka. Which means you're waiting around the restaurant while they prepare your meal. Worse, they're absolute jerks about it.

Sure, some upscale restaurants don't do takeout orders. But Apteka isn't that. It's a bunch of hipsters (I say that lovingly because I probably am one) standing around in torn-up hoodies.

I liked the food, for sure, but the snippy staff and unwelcoming policies have to go. This is exactly why non-vegans hate trying vegan places."}
{"text":"Best vegan food in Pittsburgh! Not even 100% sure what was in some of the more complex dishes but I do know that it tasted out of this world."}
{"text":"Very nice late night vegan joint with great vibes! Good prices and Flavors ! It's cafe style so you order at the bar and grab a seat.
After 10pm they serve a late night menu so make sure you see why they offer, they seem like they change up the menu weekly to keep it fresh.
The hostess and bartender are super nice and made sure to recommend the best options as well make sure we had everything we needed.

Would love to come back!!"}
{"text":"My partner and I went to Apteka on a Saturday night. It was about 8:00pm and there was a line out the door, which moved relatively quickly. The menu is posted on the wall as you enter and you order everything (drinks and food) at the counter when you walk in. You can choose to leave your check open or close it right then. From there, you take a number and find an open table. Being 8:00pm on a Saturday, it was pretty packed and we came pretty close to having our food arrive before a table opened up, but it worked out after all. 

For drinks:
- vodka 
- whiskey/fernet 
- gin/celery
- whiskey/prune

Verdict -- All of the drinks were REALLY good except the whiskey/prune drink. It tasted like a flat jack and coke and the prune juice was more like syrup at the bottom. No bueno.

For food, we shared:
- kanapki
- pierogi
- horse & pepper sandwich

Verdict -- Kanapki were very good and each were unique. Both of the pierogi were really good. The horse & pepper sandwich was good, but probably wouldn't order it again. I'd rather try the other good looking dishes they had!

Overall, I would highly recommend giving this place a shot. I think the creative dishes would leave even the most devout carnivores satisfied. My one real gripe is how the restaurant is set up. I get that they want to have a relaxed vibe by having you order and pay for everything at the front, but if you want to order more drinks or to close your tab, you have to get back in line (which can be long depending on when you go) to do so. I would think having the servers handle additional drink orders and the check at your table would have been a better set up, but maybe I'm wrong."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh and I'm not a vegan. I have had Pierogi, Kluski Slaskie, and the Baba Jaga and I would recommend all. Definitely get an order of Piergois. You won't be disappointed. 

Cocktails are also good. Prices are more than reasonable. Good service."}
{"text":"This is the best meal that I've had in recent memory. I came here with two friends, and everything on the menu looked so good that we were compelled to order one of everything.

And we didn't regret it. Every dish was brilliant. I especially enjoyed a cold potato, yoghurt, and lingonberry bowl and the fennel terrine. These were utterly exceptional. That said, all of the other dishes were phenomenal as well..

The food is surprisingly cheap given the quality of ingredients and preparation. I'd be pleased to get these dishes as part of a fancy schmancy tasting menu, yet I was able to get them instead in the comfortable, inviting environs of Apteka at a fraction of the price. This place is truly remarkable. I'm hope to come back soon."}
{"text":"Apteka lives up to the hype! I dig the laid back but classy atmosphere. There were fresh bouquets of flowers around the restaurant, felt big, great lighting and because of how hot it was they opened the back garage door to let a nice breeze flow through. The menu is up on the wall when you enter Apetka and you order at the counter right next to it. I wish the \"Order Here\" sign was bigger for people like me - I missed it totally and thought we would be served at our table but luckily my husband saw it when we first came in. I would have been sitting at our table awaiting menus for much longer... We had 4 pierogis, baba jaga and kanapki, all of which were delicious. The baba jaga is a substantial sandwich. I had a beer and my husband had the bourbon cocktail. I don't normally like bourbon but I liked this cocktail however my husband thought it wasn't bourbon-y enough for him. Parking is on the street and tables essentially are first come first serve. We will be back to Apetka such a fresh spin on a traditional cuisine."}
{"text":"The food here is incredible! Met a vegetarian friend here for dinner and drinks, and I was not disappointed. I had Pierogies and Borscht, both were fantastic and I would not have known they were vegan if nobody told me. It was difficult to get a table, but once we found one it was a great night."}
{"text":"I heard such great things about this place that when I had an invitation to dinner I suggested this location.  I really was dying to try their Perogies.  They are served as two different types of Perogies, two different fillings in one platter; unfortunately the one that had the dark filling was not to my liking, the other was delicious and since I'm a vegan there was practically nothing else on the menu that I could order other than the mushroom soup, which was delicious.

I would say this is a really great place to go if you're Polish. It's seems to really focus on that cuisine; you can tell by the menu and I'm amazed at how crowded it was so I guess having the location close to Polish Hill was instrumental to their success."}
{"text":"First off I am NOT a vegetarian nor a vegan, but was eating with a friend who was a vegetarian and so I thought i'd give this place a shot. The food is off the hook!!!! Fantastic and if vegan food all over tasted like this, I wouldn't sneer at it quite so much.

The food was really amazing. So much variety, creative and most importantly tasty! We tried more than half the menu and just about everything did not disappoint. Highlights were the peirogis and the faux fried cheese made with bubble mushroom which i had to ask twice if it was cheese! Potato dumplings were great as were the cabbage and oyster mushrooms. Only dish not so great was the potato pancakes...a little too soggy and not as much flavor.

I would gladly come back here any day of the week and proudly eat vegan!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, wonderful meal! I used to wait in line one Saturday every month for a taste of these delicious pierogis and I was delighted to visit their new restaurant. The flavors in the dishes were very thoughtful. Just delicious! The abundant bouquets of dried flowers were a lovely touch!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. The food is amazing (I'm not even a vegetarian), the space is beautiful, and the staff make you feel like you are at home."}
{"text":"What a cool place, simple but clean and inviting decor, and amazing food.
I love how casual it is, and yet the food is prepared with a gourmet care that was unexpected and exciting. Cocktails were also quite good.

I'm so excited to see Pittsburgh exploring some of its Eastern European roots through its foodie lens!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites in town. Fun, contemporary, the food is interesting and super tasty. It's simple, not pretentious. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"They have a few kinks to work out (like accepting too many people in the door and not having enough tables) but overall OMG.

I'm not a vegetarian, so I wasn't over-the-moon about trying this place out, but it will probably quickly become one of my favorites.  

For food I've had (so far):  Pierogis (yum!), the baba jaga (fantastic sandwich and heavy); my favorite - kartofle (potato apple lingonberry yogurt), and the vegetarian special sandwich (not my favorite).  Everythign is really well made, and you don't go home hungry!

Know before you go:  Craft cocktails are different and you have to go with an open mind, also, you will line up at the door, place your order, be handed a number and then go sit (Panera style)- this can be a bit awkward as you can have a number and possibly not a table?!"}
{"text":"Apteka had me eating vegetables I don't usually love and loving them. My family came here together and I was able to sample a few different things from the menu. I got one of the sandwich's and my dad got the other. The sandwich's were my favorite part of what we ate but everything was of note. I am a vegetarian but this is the kind of place omnivores can really enjoy."}
{"text":"I came here for drinks before and had a decent experience, but came here for a birthday dinner last night and finally got to try the food.

Service: It was average. I walked in and looked around, not knowing if I was supposed to seat myself or how ordering worked and had to ask one of the 4 people behind the bar if I should sit anywhere or wait to be seated. Would have appreciated being acknowledged and told how their process worked. No one walked over to my table in the first 10 minutes after I sat down... not even to offer water. Not great. 

Food: Overall a 4/5. The pierogies and beet sandwich were incredible. I don't think I liked beets until trying the sandwich! The Salatka with sunflower shoots was... fine. The gin and prosecco cocktail was delicious. Super refreshing and I could have had 3 more! The apple crumble with sour cherry compote was UH-mazing. The only other thing I wasn't a fan of is that... dill. comes. on. everything. They are quite the fans of dill. You would hardly realize this menu is vegan...great options here.

Apteka fits in with the revamping third Renaissance that Pittsburgh is going through where hipsters abound and service is hands-off. I enjoy the food and drinks, but the service could definitely use some fine-tuning."}
{"text":"A local friend took us here for my introduction to Pittsburgh.  The food totally rocked.  We had non-veggie east european food another day, but Apteka was better.  The cocktail with the poppy seeds is pretty awesome too.  Yes, the line to place an order can be long, but they're giving loving attention to each customer when you get to the front so it's all worth it."}
{"text":"Apteka is a wonderful addition to the Pittsburgh food scene. The menu is fantastic and everything I tried was just bursting with flavors! It was a pleasant surprise for me, because I tend to find Polish food to be rather boring - it's not on my usual rotation. However, Apteka has the best pierogi I've had and I'm not usually a fan of stuffed cabbage, but the one here was very good. To top it all off, there is a pretty good cocktail menu. The only downside is that it can take a while to order and the space gets very loud - it's hard to maintain a conversation here."}
{"text":"Apetka is a great little space with charming decor. However, when I say small it truly is. To the point that a line goes out the door for folks waiting to get in. I understand the European concept of ordering at the bar and having the food brought to the table. But again, there's just not room. Ok with that small little negative comes the big, big positive. I am over the moon with this menu. Love that they offer small and big plates as well as fantastic cocktails. And the black pepper soda, you guys, OMG. I need that bottled for home: it's so good. Went with friends and had tartine and pierogis. I'm a meat eater but can throw down on some good vegan. The food is absolutely divine. The vodka black currant and rum plum wine juniper cocktails are so refreshing and appealing. Just a quick walk from home, I'll definitely be a regular. This is one of those spots we'd walk by anxiously awaiting their opening. Wow it was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely unique!

Came here on an April Sunday Evening. It was a little busy when we got there but it quickly got quieter. 

We decided to order the potato pancakes, the Baba Jaga sandwich and the pierogis. 

The potato pancakes were super delicious and we loved the creamy sauce served with it. The Baba jaga and the pierogis were both a little odd. The flavor was very vinegar-y and acidic. We weren't too fond of the pierogi fillings either. The flavors just were too strong and overwhelming.

For dessert, we had their cream cake with roasted pears. The cake was like a sugary plain donut. Very good but plain. We enjoyed the sweet pears too. 

This place has especially unique flavors, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Let me just say this up front, because everyone needs to know, this place is delicious and packs some mean flavors into every dish. Oh... and it's vegan. But that should be an after-thought, because you will NOT miss meat here. You won't even THINK of meat here. You'll just think about how every bite is ridiculously good. 

Everything about this place is just stellar. The ambiance is warm and inviting, but also casual. You actually order at the front counter and then find yourself a seat. It's pretty tiny, but has a beautiful outdoor area that's covered. I'm wondering what they'll do with the space in the winter, because it's great to have that extra space. There's beautiful floral arrangements on every table, shelf and counter. They really create a comfortable environment. 

We ordered the Kartofle z jogurtem migdalowym. Don't worry, you'll probably have no clue how to pronounce anything on the menu other than Pierogi. The dish is potato, apples, lingonberry and yogurt. It's different, but delicious. The potato's were crisply cooked and the combo of the berry and yogurt was great. We also got the Kanapki, which is freshly baked bread (I believe baked in house) with different spreads on top. I wish I could remember what they were, but they rotate daily. Finally we had the pierogies, which are seriously a must get here. One was sauerkraut and mushroom and the other one is smoked potato, parsnip, and turnip greens with smothered yogurt and mustard on top. Both were incredible, but I liked the smoked ones the best. 

On the weekends, I don't doubt it's packed. So my advice would be to go early. We went right when it opened at 5pm and we sat right down. By the time we left at 6:30pm the place was packed! I'm not surprised, it should be packed because it's awesome!"}
{"text":"My vegan son brought us to this laid back restaurant. best meal ever! The meals ' flavors exploded with multiple layers of discovery. Even our meat & potato 65 yr old relative gives it a 2 thumbs up. Now that's amazing"}
{"text":"So good. So so so good! I had the pierogies, the tart, and some kind of black pepper soda. I have not eaten meat in 30 years and this is hands down some of the best vegetarian/vegan food I have had. And it was very filling, and totally worth it."}
{"text":"Yes!!! I love this place!  Reasonable prices, unique and flavorful food, tasty cocktails, and modern design.  I hope they get an outdoor patio in time for summer! Don't let the fact that it's vegan scare you away--it's really worth trying for meat-eaters and veggie folks alike, assuming you're not too afraid of spice.

The kanapi of 3 different toasts were all tasty, but the one with the pickles was stellar.  Kind of wish I could order it a la carte.  

The pierogies are amazing (so glad they serve them in two different size portions), and the cabbage rolls were great with a killer, memorable tomato sauce.  The entree salad (can't remember the name) was unique because of the bitter, spicy greens.  

I'm really looking forward to trying the sandwiches soon.  

A wine option or two wouldn't go amiss.

Such a wonderful addition to this end of town, and like no other restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Truly amazing food and drinks. Everything I've consumed here has been astoundingly flavorful! And the vibe is extremely comfortable. Go here, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally got around to breaking our B52 habit and tried Apteka. After all of the amazing things that we kept hearing, we figured it was finally time.

To start - we tried the potato dumplings and the pierogis. (This will be the extent of me knowing what I was eating.) Both were super delicious; and we followed the food runner's suggestion of eating the dumplings first, while they were still hot. The pierogis had a crunchy texture on the outside, and full of flavor on the inside.

We ordered two more small plates, but what we ordered - I cannot remember what they were called, nor do I really know what I was eating. But they were also pretty delicious. 

My only disappointment is that I never experienced that roll-my-eyes-in-the-back-of-my-head kind of flavor or texture (my husband also agrees). Don't get me wrong - it was good; but not at the level that I felt that I was being hyped up for. Compared to some of our other favorites: B52, Onion Maiden, and Gluten Free Goat - where every thing on the menu is orgasmic - we didn't feel that way at Apteka. I also felt that the music selection was a little too avant garde to create a comfortable atmosphere. 

That being said, we will still return when we're craving some salty and earthy potatoes; especially if it's late at night. The space is wonderfully simple and feels open with a community feel. It's a great addition to the Penn Ave food scene."}
{"text":"Drinks here are consistently good. They have creative cocktails and reasonable prices. My favorite drink is the gin, prosecco, and pear, but I've liked everything I had tried!

If you come later in the evening, after the dinner rush, it's not hard to get a table, even with a large group. On Sunday nights they are open late - hard to find in Pittsburgh! The ambience in the evening is nice, low lighting and not too loud. I think it would be a great date spot 

I have not had food here, but on my last visit my friends ordered dinner, and particularly liked the pirogues."}
{"text":"I don't spend a lot of time at vegetarian restaurants. The ones that have garnered repeat visits basically only include two now defunct places in Brooklyn, and the kosher/vegetarian/Chinese joint where my centenarian grandmother hosts her birthday banquets. 

This place is none of those. I know that because it's in Pittsburgh, and because my grandmother wasn't here when I walked in. So that's a lengthy and useless description of what Apteka is not. Sorry. 

What Apteka actually is:

A Polish vegan place that doesn't cater to your inability to pronounce Polish vegan food. 

For instance, you should probably order the seler z jablkiem i ziemniakami i chrzanem.

A Polish vegan place that serves interesting and tasty food. 

Pierogies (what I said above), salatkas (salads), and anything else you might get will be high quality. I did personally think the potato pancakes were underseasoned and too dense, but no one is perfect.

A Polish vegan place with excellent and interesting cocktails. 

There was grass in my drink, and I liked it. Not the kind of grass that your parents were into in the 60s but subsequently and hypocritically got mad about when they found it in your car. The grass that you find everywhere. And I liked it. And the other cocktails I had. And my meal, and the service, and the vibe. 

So I'm adding this to the short list of vegetarian places that garner repeat visits.

Good work, Apteka."}
{"text":"This place absolutely blew me away! I'm not vegan or vegetarian but sometimes a girl just needs to take a break from the meat in this town! Am I right?! Well anyway the atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired. With all the food joints piping up in Pittsburgh it's not hard to notice that killer food, drinks, and service are preferred to those places that focus singularly on the mood lighting. So happy this place decided to turn all of their focus on putting together amazing dishes. The potatoes were my favorite and the drinks were interestingly light which both filled me up and started a good buzz. If you need a break from the exorbitant amount of steak, burgers, and salads with French fries then check this out."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since its inception and finally made my way. We ordered the soup, the special sandwich, and the pyrogies (spelling?) - all to split. The only downfall of this place is that I saw two menus - one on the wall and one on the counter. I can't tell you what  the soup I had, nor the pyrogies we had. We tried to determine what was in each item as we bit into it, but it was nearly impossible hence the reason I would've loved to reference the menu as we dined. Anyways, it's a vegetarians paradise, nothing was off limits. The sandwich was a little earthy, but the aioli or vinegarette helped to balance the flavor. Pyrogies were absolutely, positively amazing. Slightly browned on the outside, beautifully flavored in every aspect. 
Price wise it was on point.  $37 for soup, big pyrogie plate, nice size sandwich, Dales Pale Ale, bottle of sparkling water. No complaints there."}
{"text":"Geez louise. I'm blown away. These pierogi are without a doubt the best I've ever had. Hand-made, browned perfectly, filled with fresh (vegan!) ingredients, and served with a tangy yogurt mustard sauce. And the portions! Well worth every penny.

I also enjoy the fresh craft cocktails and craft beers available. My fave cocktail so far is the vodka with black currant and burnt lemon - full of flavor and refreshing.

The vibe at Apteka is laid-back, with mismatched chairs and minimal decor. You order at the bar and food/drinks are brought out to you (seat yourself), which adds to the relaxed feel. Street parking is available on Penn Avenue. I see they now have a brightly-lit moniker out front so it's even easier to find.

Apteka will please your veg and carnivore friends alike, and I look forward to many more delicious meals there."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night and it BLEW MY MIND. Every single thing I tried was delightful and innovative and just straight up delicious -- though it was visions of pierogi that danced in my head last night. They are amazing!! The dough is so perfect and the filling so scrumptious. 

The space is inviting and pleasant and the staff are all so friendly and enthusiastic. You can feel how invested everyone is in this awesome venture. 

Run don't walk! I live in Brooklyn or I would be here every damn day."}
{"text":"Great food and great cocktails. Even if you're not vegan, you'll love the food they serve here. Give it a try. They put tons of care into their food and drinks."}
{"text":"Very surprised by how much I enjoyed my meal there.  Not that I heard poor things about Apteka-- in fact, the opposite as my son has been saying great things about the food-- but, rather, I've never eaten at a vegan restaurant before.

A couple of us had the kluski, my wife had the pierogies, someone had a sandwich.  The menu is pretty limited but changes all the time-- yet we all left there very pleased with what we ate!  Plus I had an interesting tequila-based cocktail that was great.  Very surprised how tasty and satisfying vegan food could be (no offense meant to any vegans or vegetarians reading this).

The restaurant is Eastern European, so it was nice to hear the gentleman behind the bar pronounce my Polish last name correctly-- then let me know that they do serve stinging nettle (what my name means) tea!

We sat in the rear half of the restaurant which had a  patio feel.  A nice space to eat and talk.

Had a lovely meal and look forward to my next visit there."}
{"text":"I went here last week with a group of friends and had an awesome experience. You order at the front when you arrive and they bring your food out to your table when it's ready. The food was awesome (I especially loved the home made bread) and the atmosphere of the restaurant was great. So glad this place has opened up."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, and I'm not vegan. My husband hates mushrooms with a passion but loved the mushroom and sauerkraut pierogies - - they make everything taste that good. We did think the set up is pretty strange - - it's a bit uncomfortable to walk in and stand waiting to make your order, and then have to come back up if you want something else. Not sure why it's done that way. But again, the food and cocktails are highly recommended."}
