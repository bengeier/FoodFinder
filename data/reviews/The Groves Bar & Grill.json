{"text":"Worst place for breakfast in Gilbert, horrible food. This place really needs to invest in a real cook.
Will never come back, period.
We estimated that half of the patrons sent thier food back (at least one time, some folks had to send back more than once) and the smug servers were totally unphased, they must be used to it.
Save yourself the headache and go somewhere, anywhere, else. This dump only survives on the overflow from the Farmhouse next door."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to The Groves.  Went on Saturday night date and as an added bonus a band was playing (which were really good).  It was packed when we arrived around 7:30 pm, and we were quickly seated at one of the last booths available.  Upon arriving at our booth I noticed that almost the entire seat cushion on both sides of our table was covered in duct tape.  That kinda turned me off.  This in turn made the seat uncomfortable.  The waitress immediately came to our table and took our drink order, that followed by asking if we were ready to order, we were not, and so she came back a few minutes later. We ordered The Caribou Special (Bacon, turkey, cheddar cheese and tomato served on grilled sourdough) with Sweet Potato Fries and a Cheeseburger with regular fries.  The food came out in a timely manner, hot and the taste was good.  I would go back to the Groves, but I do think the booth seats need a little TLC, please......"}
{"text":"The groves bar and grill this place sucks all I could hear from my table is a very depressed elderly man screaming at his kitchen crew and his servers. I felt really bad for the staff listening to this old man scream and gripe about every little detail, although my food was made fast and tasted really good... simply because the disrespect I heard from a owner to employees this is not the type of establishment I want to spend my money at....not to mention the roaches we caught out our table"}
{"text":"Had breakfast there with friends for the first time on Saturday and was impressed. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. We never had to ask for refills for coffee or water. Sure it's a bar, but it smelled like cinnamon and was way clean. We shared a cinnamon roll and it was amazing. Huge fresh roll of fluffy with a wonderful not too overly sweet cream cheese frosting. My country breakfast was very good except the gravy for the biscuit. That was pretty bland...ok very bland. But they didn't give us a problem when we asked for separate checks which is always a plus in my book. It was also very reasonable for the amount of food served. My friends and I will be back."}
{"text":"Service at the bar and grille was not god and we would appreciate the better service at that location. Customer service needs to be better if you want us to be back."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and enjoy great food!  Alaska Amber with fresh made food!  Must go....  Been there for all 3 meals and have not had a bad meal..."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks my wife and I met with two very good friends. We dicided to have Lunch at the Groves Bar & Grill in Gilbert AZ. My wife and I have eaten there a few times. On this trip I Orderd the Prime Rib melt. it came with a side. Belive me you get plenty of food for your money. Dennis comes out and meets his custermers,and makes them feel very welcome. His staff are very helpfull and very knowledgeable.The Restaurant was very clean well maintained.Ifill that the Groves is good a value for money. I Have many items from the breakfast and lunch menu and I have enjoyed everything. On our last visit Dennis had made a Pumkin Cheese Cake,it was out of this world. Ronald Knowlden."}
{"text":"We have been there a few times in the past few years on Friday for the fish fry and it was good each time until the last outing . . . we won't be back. We always enjoyed the hushpuppies ( had whole corn in the batter) and the texture of the batter they used to have on the fish was want we enjoyed.  Upon arrival we ordered extra hushpuppies and had the fish.  When dinner arrived we both grabbed a hushpuppy only to find the inside was uncooked and doughy, so  we grabbed another only to find the same condition.  We asked the server and she pleasantly requested some new ones, they were the same uncooked condition.  I again mentioned it to the server and she again pleasantly said Dennis . . (who was as the previous reviewer said was acting like he owned the place) would make some fresh one . .well they were the same, uncooked or undercooked in the center and still pasty and doughy.  I informed the server and she said they were made the same as they have been for years and nothing changed. .And for Dennis, he never did ask how they were or seemed to care. Maybe I am incorrect but hushpuppies are or should be the same texture as cornbread, not this place.  Anyhow the fish wasn't up to the standard as was in the past and we will not return . . too bad 'cause it was a great place. The serves was great and pleasant, but the standard of the food was subpar."}
{"text":"Best deal in Gilbert. The hours are funky for catching early drinks but we'll worth it considering up the street the hip places are charging 5X for the same. Support this very local watering hole. And the food is good too."}
{"text":"First time here and had breakfast on the patio!! It was amazing!! I had the Country Benedict and it was perfect. Good drinks, with a great pour for a screw driver!!"}
{"text":"I like a bar that also has good bar food.  I do agree with other reviews that the service is a little slow, but I am normally not in a hurry when I go out to eat.  The Jalapeno Mac and Cheese is very good and Love there french fries.  Everyone is nice and welcoming. I will for sure be back"}
{"text":"Had the Guacamole burger . Messiest burger ever but also the best. Meat was juicy and the guac just spicy enough. Fries are outstanding. Services is laid back, our waitress was a kick. Funny and knowledgeable about the food. Just love this place."}
{"text":"Driving around trying to find a good place for brunch on a holiday... Saw some cars here and thought we would try it. The place is cute and cozy, great atmosphere. We were sat right away and greeted just as fast by our server. She was very friendly and attentive. They have a full bar which is awesome... The bloody Mary's were good and only $3. I had their country Benedict and my friend had an omelet. The food was fast and yummy, only complaint here was that the potatoes were to salty for my taste. Definitely will be back to try some of their awesome happy hour deals and other food choices."}
{"text":"We had seen this restaurant featured on MysteryDiners on the Food Network last year and had been intrigued. We looked for it a couple of times halfheartedly when passing the area, but it is tucked back in this quaint litte shop area and hard to see from the street. They have a sign out towards the street but we had missed it. We noticed a lot of really bad reviews, but after reading them realized that most of these people had NEVER BEEN INSIDE to eat here - not reliable reviews! Anyway, we finally got in there this last weekend. The owner was in there, he was absolutely personable, professional and checked in with us during our meal. The wait staff provided superior service. We had thought that they must pool their tips because of the way all of the waitresses covered down for each other and even when it was busy you never had to wait for anything, but apparently the don't! They are just excellent servers. There was live music when we went there and the guy is excellent - it really added to the experience. The food was wonderful. We had a pizza and then for dessert we had this amazing sundae with a foundation of a lemonbar and covered with really good vanilla ice cream and all the other sundae goodies. It was so good that my husband and I decided we'd come back next time just for wine and sundaes so we wouldn't have to share! This place is a definite must try."}
{"text":"Great service!!   very nice owner Dennis   I would recommend the French toast!!!!!!!!  It Rocks"}
{"text":"James and his staff pulled off a Bridal Shower in their beautiful back patio area on a very short timeline.  It was very quiet venue and the area at night was perfect for an outdoor event.  James had less than a week's notice to make this whole event happen, but from the beginning was very agreeable and flexible in the menu and the food that we served and had many good ideas and suggestions on what menu items would work.  He coordinated all the rental items like the tables, chairs, dishes and linens and also worked extremely well with the Event Coordinator that I had hired.  The two of them made sure that this event was not lacking in any way and the food he served was outstanding.  From the Cocktail hor' dourves to the main course...all the food was nicely displayed and very hot and tasty.  Thanks for a great event! 

PS  Anyone considering an outdoor event should visit The Groves and take a look at their private patio in the back."}
{"text":"We have been to the Groves 3 or 4 times and will go back.  We love their Fish Fry, all you can eat AND their biscuits and gravy are the best.  The wait staff is very pleasant and knowledgeable.  Dennis, the owner, will come and talk to you if he isn't too busy in the kitchen.  They have a well stocked bar, too.  I have had their patty melt and it was very good, too.  A good place to go and try their cheesecake."}
{"text":"Wow...Still love this place. Friendly and clean...the food is so not bar food. Wood fired pizzas are to die for. All the ingredients are fresh..crust soft and tasty. Has the best clam chowder..lots of clams in creamy soup n just right amount of potatoes. You can tell they use angus beef..great burgers and loved the sweet potato fries. Service was good..my glass was never empty n I did not have to wait to be seated.. Great music Friday nights with Streamline...I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Terrible Father's Day  sat quickly and then waited. 3 tables that were sat after my wife and I were served food before us  after 45 minutes asked what was going on and was told busy. Food should come out in order. When food arrived only mine showed up. My wife's came 10 minutes later and was wrong. Cancelled hers she didn't get to eat because I was done. Worst breakfast ever."}
{"text":"I am surprised to see all the negative reviews. We have gone there for breakfast numerous times and love The Groves. The wait staff is always very friendly and attentive the food is wonderful. The Eggs Benedict is one of the best I have ever had and the reindeer sausage is great. We will be trying lunch or dinner soon. We drive or ride from the far east valley to go here."}
{"text":"Just saw this place on Mystery Diners and the food looked good so we decided to give it a try. Cute place, mediocre food and terrible service. If your gonna have a Guacamole Burger on your menu, you better have good guac. It was days old, brownish in color and tasted terrible. Thank goodness the delicious pretzel bun and fries made up for it. Obviously the owner's son, the cook, didn't care as he was one of the 2 in the kitchen at the time our food came out. We knew it was his son by the obnoxious conversations he was having with the rest of the front of house staff, bad mouthing his father. Oops! 
The bartender was unattentive and took our order wrong. Didn't know what the food was when it came out and had to ask the cook which burger was what.  She missed where we said we wanted sweet potato fries and had regular ones for us and didn't use gloves while making our salad right in front of us.
It's sad that Dennis takes pride in his restaurant and even after making an appearance on the show that the staff and food is still satisfactory."}
{"text":"Love having a neighborhood place to drop in and have a cold brew and some wings! 
Beer was cold, BBQ Honey wings were great! Will be coming back. We had very good service!"}
{"text":"The decor is confused.  Is a sports bar?  A wine bar?  A Mediterranean theme?  Mexican?  Just amateurish and weird.  Seating made me uncomfortable, felt temporary and out of place.  Felt like at any moment the tables would be pulled out and be replaced with a pool table and bar stools.

Food was adequate but unspectacular.  One step better than bar food.

The waitstaff was friendly but unorganized.  I had 4 different people bothering my table every time one of them walked by.  Give me one damn waitress that visits on occasion and other than that, leave me alone to converse with my party."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if I could. Absolutely worst meal I have ever had. The meatloaf was cold. The meat was full of hard pieces. I wondered how many days ago it was made. The shepherds pie was mushy and all you could taste was the beer in it. Service was slow . . . but we expected that going in.  All around bad experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most enjoyable place to rest, relax, meet friends and have great food.   We've tried many different items on the menu and loved them all.  My son's girlfriend is a vegetarian and she loves it.  Best fries and chicken skewers.  The staff always makes sure we are taken care of quickly."}
{"text":"Good , but they are no longer open in the evenings..seems as though they are involved with JC's steak house"}
{"text":"Very good food and service! High recommend the prime rib sandwich, the best I have ever tasted!"}
{"text":"Just went to the Groves with my mother last weekend. We split their Green Grove pizza and it was fabulous. My mother had a glass of chardonnay (likely the cheapest on their menu) and it was tasty. I had the Alaskan Amber they had on tap which was a perfect compliment to the pizza. Service was great as well...just enough checking in to make sure we were okay without being overly interrupting.  You can't beat the location right in downtown Gilbert. And, they even kept my credit card there for 4 days after I left it on the table after paying the bill! Apparently the Alaskan Amber is too much for this girl to handle!  We'll be back for sure..."}
{"text":"The food was terrible and the service was even worse!
I saw another review that said they had new owners well if that is so that explains why the place has changed for the worse! 
It was so bad I will never walk in this place again."}
{"text":"Guess what? The Groves Bar and Grill opened a bakery next door! My husband just brought me breakfast in bed. The cinnamon sticky bun was soft  sweet and perfectly spiced and the ham and cheese turnover was a flaky, buttery masterpiece! 

Let's help this bakery get its place on the map! Yum!"}
{"text":"Not the Farmhouse replacement...I haven't even been, but I am going to say \"it doesn't compare\".  We had to wait a long time, we couldn't sit outside because there weren't enough sun shades/umbrellas, food was average for breakfast, the spicy bloody mary was good.  People were nice enough but its a bar atmosphere at the end of the day."}
{"text":"Every year around this time my family goes  on a quest for a Friday night fish fry.  Having grown up in Wisconsin, where Friday night fish fry's are as much a part of the culture as ice fishing, brandy old fashioned's and  watching the Packers on Sunday during football season, I fancy myself as having a tad bit of knowledge of what a good fish fry should be. 

So far in my annual fish fry quest, I have had moderate success at best--until last week.   As part of my quest, we went to The Groves last Friday to try out their Friday night fish fry.  They offer an individual plate or all you can eat for $2.00 more (we current and former Wisconsinites don't get these great looking physiques by only eating one plate of fried fish).  So I opted for the all you can eat.  This covers only fish, I'm guessing if you want additional fries, hush puppies or cole slaw, that is extra, but I'm here for the fish. 

I was very pleased with the meal.  The fish is a lightly battered cod with a very good flavor.  It is not the overwhelming pile of breading with a little fish stuffed somewhere in the mess that I have come across on occasion.  The pieces are not huge, so they are evenly cooked throughout, however the staff was very attentive and ensured we always had fish at the table.  The meal came with hush puppies, fries and some coleslaw, all of which tasted good, but I wasn't there for the sides.  

While there were other things that looked appealing on the menu, I had to stick to the fish, but we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to the Groves because it's heavily advertised on a food radio show and the owners are the moderators.  I am not a pill when it comes to food at all.  I ordered a hamburger with fries and pickles and that's all.  The hamburger bun was apprarently filled with garlic which I don't want in my bread.  At first I couldn't tell if it was the meat or the bread.  Wound up eating most, but not all of the meat.  Fries are ok but so are McDonalds.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"One star for the bartender for apologizing to us for the fact we watched our food sit on a serving bar for approximately 20 minutes without anyone picking it up.  One waitress even brought it to us after we stared at it for 20 minutes and told us the plate was hot.

We didn't even bother with the food and won't be back.  This place needs some serious help."}
{"text":"This was our 3rd wine tasting and food pairing, again we were not disappointed Dennis out does himself. The food is outstanding and the wine just adds to the pleasure of the whole night."}
{"text":"I visited The Groves Bar and Grill in Gilbert, AZ with my husband and friend on a Friday night. We were greeted by a hostess who seated us promptly. There was some enjoyable live music playing when we arrived but unfortunately it ended shortly after our arrival (just after 9pm). 

Our server was friendly, but shared that it was only his 4th day, so he wasn't as knowledgeable about the menu as we would have hoped. We started with the chips and salsa; pretty basic, but not bad. My friend and I ordered the \"Backpacker\" pizza. The menu indicated that one of the toppings was kalamata olives. We asked the server to only put the olives on one half, when it came out there were just plain green olives on half (and we later realized that we had been charged $1 to \"add olives\"). We asked our server if the 12\" pizza was a \"two-person\" pizza and he recommended that we go with the 16\" saying we might even have some leftovers. The pizza came LOADED with tons of fresh veggies, but after 2 pieces each, we were stuffed and ended up taking half of it home. The 12\" would have been plenty. The pizza crust was light and fluffy. The fresh veggies could have been cut up smaller; they were quite large and made eating the pizza a bit more work, but overall the pizza was delicious!
 
My husband wasn't hungry when we went, so he got the Chicken Fried Steak to go. He ordered it with a baked potato; it also came with broccoli and a nice sized side salad. The balsamic vinaigrette dressing was good. Good size portions. He said it was alright, probably would have been better if he would have eaten it in the restaurant, rather than to-go. Overall, our server was extremely friendly and attentive, often checking in with us to see how our food was and if we needed drink refills.  The owner stopped by our table and encouraged us to check out the outside patio area. The patio area outside looked really nice; we may have to sit out there next time we visit. Overall experience was very good; we'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went there today for breakfast. Nice little place , makes you feel like you're not in Gilbert.  Food was good, we didn't have to wait long. Friendly wait staff and quick service which I love."}
{"text":"I gotta be honest, prior to heading to The Groves, I was a bit apprehensive about visiting this establishment due to the reviews about the timeliness of their staff. BUT, I've come to learn that the quality of service is in the eye of the beholder.

So- Here goes...

I walk in the front door and immediately notice two patrons up at the bar, two tables occupied & two booths occupied with customers. The place was clean and quite whimsical for a bar & grill. The ambiance draws you in and makes you want to sit and stay a while.  There were two young ladies tending bar & floor. This was approximately 1:00PM. I thought to myself, \"Oh jeeze... If those reviews are right, I'm going to be waiting for my food\".

Well, I really feel sorry for those other reviewers due to the fact that my service was FANTASTIC!

As soon as we sat down a server approached us and took our drink orders. She kept us engaged the entire time until we were ready to order and before I knew it, I had myself the best chipotle burger I'd ever had! 100% Angus beef with (SPICY!) chipotle peppers on a soft & chewy pretzel bread bun! Top that with fries and (another) beer that she had ready for me as soon as I was a swallow away from empty, and I was a happy customer!

Trust me, don't shy away from this amazing bar & grill! It's well worth the visit.

Cheers!
Shawn"}
{"text":"Been here three times now.  The first time was awesome, the waitress was attentive and the food was good.  But it was an off time and it was fairly empty.
The second two times it was pretty busy. Ending with our visit today.  We were seated quickly on the patio, which is nice.  Got Coffee fairly quickly from the girl who seated us.  Needed a few minutes to look over the menu, so our waitress said she'd be back in a few.  Well, that was probably 10 minutes or so.....The food took quite a while to come, and then the potatoes were luke warm on my plate, my husbands were well grilled, unlike mine..... I had eggs benedict, and the eggs were poached almost hard (unexpectedly).  My husband had the some like it hot omelet, which he was very happy with.  We were finally able to get one of the other servers to get us some more coffee.  Our server would scoot by and ask if everything was still perfect...... but you could tell she really did not care.  The food has been good here, but the service, not so great.
We might come back, because the chorizo is really good, but not when they are busy."}
{"text":"I love the groves! Great service, great food, and a great location!!!

If you want to miss the rush come any time after 8 pm! 

Love getting the burger, steak, and they have an amazing breakfast menu!

Super personable servers and good quality food. 

It's like a home cooked meal away from home!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim because we saw it on the Food Network...
Glad I didn't read the reviews first!

We had a great experience!! People were friendly, they had a great selection of beers, and all the food came out in respectable timing! We had appetizers and dinner, and both were brought out promptly. 

Even better - they had live music going on. And pretty decent live music at that. Will be back for a pre-game kind of night."}
{"text":"New owners. We gave them two tries. I doubt that we will return. I had always enjoyed the bar food of the previous owners. So we tried lunch the first week with the new owners. 1130, no other customers. And breakfast stopped at 11. About 1/2 the menu was marked \"coming soon\" which was not a good sign.  I tried  to get an omelette because they had very few if any nonmeat offerings at  lunch time and it was a Friday in Lent. No fish sandwich? Nope. Just a full dinner. Kitchen decided they would make me an omelette.  given that we were the only customers in the restaurant I thought their attitude was a little ridiculous but I decided to just go with soup.  So the hubs ordered a grilled cheese with french fries and a side salad and I ordered the clam chowder. The clam chowder was the saltiest chowder I have ever had. It was very full of potatoes and other items but I didn't have much clam in it, just a lot of salt. The grilled cheese was not worth it.  And the fries were horrible. Not sure if the oil was dirty, old, or not hot enough. But the potatoes had a very odd flavor to them and I think they had moved from the fresh-cut fries of the old owners to frozen fries. Strike one.

We returned this evening to try the fish fry and see whether they had as nice of a fish fry as the previous owners. More items were now available on the menu.  Again still a Friday in Lent so I was in search of a meatless meal. I asked if they had their macaroni and cheese available and they informed me that it was available for children only, that they could not yet serve it to the adults because they weren't ready to release to adults. Hmmm.  Okay. Wanting to avoid that clam chowder again,  I asked what kind of tomato soup they had and the waiter looked at me with all seriousness and said it's tomato soup, what else do you need to know. I really should have stopped at that point and left, but I went down that path and ordered a bowl of tomato soup for my dinner. Hubs ordered the fish dinner. The dinner was fine.  the grease on the fish wasn't too bad.  the potatoes were still nothing to write home about and there's a small coleslaw garnish on the side.  they still don't have any baked potatoes and there's nothing you can really substitute for anything yet. The tomato soup made the clam chowder look like a foodies dream. It wasn't awful, it was worse than awful. It wasn't creamy and although was full of dark herbs I'm thinking it was oregano not basil because it had a very off taste. And I swear it had an undertone of cayenne or some pepper because long after that spoonful was swallowed, you could taste something on your tongue that indicated was a little bit of spice. Tomato soup should never have a very heavy feel or taste to it, even homemade soup shouldn't. quite sure where they missed the boat. I ate three spoons of the soup and that was it. Not that the server even noticed or cared. 

Now here comes the best part of it. Halfway through our meal I flagged the server down and requested he put in an order for a club sandwich to go for my son we were meeting. He came back with a message from the kitchen that they had a large party out on the patio and they were too busy to take any more food orders right now, so if we wanted to wait an additional 20 minutes to half hour they would then accommodate us and put the order in ; otherwise we could not get our sandwich to go. Really? you can't take any more food orders? They were seating new tables all around us. So we asked how could they allow three new tables to be seated but refuse  to make us a sandwich. The server consulted the owner and returned to say that  allegedly they were telling them that  it would be a 30 minute wait before they could order food. I really can't imagine anyone going to a restaurant knowing that they couldn't order for 30 minutes.  

I feel badly that The Groves new owners haven't figured it out yet. We can walk there but won't.  There are too many other places in Gilbert in the same price bracket where we can get better service and better food."}
{"text":"Great and fun atmosphere. I want to go back and get the awesome fish and chips. The cheeseburger is also a must try. Very nice dinner."}
{"text":"Been here the times and each time we have felt welcomed into the group of regular customers! I have a feeling once people come here, they keep coming back. A REALLY great neighborhood vibe. Oh, and the food is delicious too!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to the Groves for a couple years and have enjoyed the experience. This morning we got the usual but this time they had outdone themselves with the \"chicken not so little\" chicken fried steak. The gravy was changed and it is now perfection! Our waiter, Warren, was awesome! We had to wait longer than usual but it was well worth the wait! Great food and service, well done!"}
{"text":"Back for breakfast today and unfortunately The Groves did not exceed my expectations enough to get four stars again. The $3.95 breakfast sign in front is definitely a bait and switch tactic because there is only one item I saw on the menu for that price and the rest was pretty expensive for what you got, or at least as high as anywhere else (no deal here). French toast came with a ball of butter as big as a golf ball and a lot of powdered sugar with a sticky syrup container along side. Nothing special but it tasted ok. 
Susan's omelet was pretty flavorless and the potatoes tasted like they had been fried in something strange or they were just starting to go bad. She told me \"you wouldn't like this.\"

Our previous lunch was very good and we were looking forward to going back for breakfast. The waitress even said everyone comes in here for breakfast??? We must be missing something here. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things. Not sure about another visit. Too many other places that have proven to be consistently good."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night. NOT crowded. We sat at the bar and the bartender was clearly bored...

This is a tiny place. I can see why some people complained about it being packed... So listen to us and go on a Monday!!!

My lovely girlfriend (she doesn't read my reviews as far as I know, but...) got the stuffed chicken. AMAZING!!! I got a small sausage pizza which was pretty good."}
{"text":"My husband and I had date night and chose this new to us restaurant. We pulled up and the building is quaint. It is in a strip mall style building. We were greeted with a huge smile by a sweet hostess. We chose to sit on the back patio because my husband is a cigar smoker. ( By the way the tables are set far enough away from each other so his smoke didn't offend anyone and we didn't even have to move them) Alex was our server and also was very full of great smiles. We ordered our drinks and asked him what he suggested for dinner. He promptly replied that they fly their Cod in from Alaska and were doing a fish fry Friday and it was a really good choice. We always try to get different things so we asked what his next choice was and again Alex was quick with another one of his favorites, the meatloaf. So I had the fish and Nic had the meatloaf. We were so happy to have taken Alex's suggestions, the food was amazing. The fish was battered so this and crunchy, unlike most places where you get the fish and you are eating all batter. You get roughly 5-6 oz of fried fish and you can taste the fish!! The sweet coleslaw was good, if you like sweet coleslaw. Nic's meatloaf was plentiful. It was moist, and came with mash and broccoli. It needed a little salt to us, but we are also heavy handed salt eaters so it was probably fine for everyone :-). I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone both as a date night or even a friend gathering. By the way prices were great too!!!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast at The Groves last Saturday.  The Eggs Benedict were super tasty and very reasonably priced. The $3 bloody marys were a great deal, too.  The funniest thing was walking in and thinking \"this place looks really familiar\" only to realize later that it looked familiar because I'd seen the episode of Mystery Diners that featured The Groves!  We can't wait to go back and try the pizza (wood-burning oven) and burger - the pretzel hamburger buns look amazing!"}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I went in for breakfast on Monday morning. We showed up early and waited until they opened. We were greeted by Bob the cook and he took our order. The server was late. Bob took our order then went in the back and knocked out our ticket. Then he brought it to our table. I'm a classically trained Chef and in this industry I appreciate the drive and determination that it takes to pick up all the pieces and make every piece work. I can't wait to go back. Awesome experience. And Bob is on point. Excellent job Chef."}
{"text":"I have passed this place a few times and decided to finally stop in today. I'm glad I did!  The food was delivered super quick (about 7 minutes or so) after I ordered and Jasmine, behind the bar, was extremely outgoing and friendly.  The food was good and I feel worth several more return trips in the future. The place was moderately busy, being a late Sunday morning, yet the wait staff never seemed to be behind. They all seemed to be ahead of the game. I loved the vibe, the employees attitudes and atmosphere of the place and look forward to my next return."}
{"text":"Last weekend we left the Gilbert Farmers Market hungry for breakfast, but saw lines out the door at the places nearby, so we wandered on down Gilbert Road and saw the sign for The Groves.  After glancing at the yelp reviews it looked like no one had discussed breakfast yet, so we thought we'd give it a try.

We had regular eggs/bacon/hash brown/toast breakfasts, with the addition of some B & G and everything was cooked perfectly.  The coffee was not memorable, but not bad.  The service was also ok.   They have several really young gals working, which is fine, but sometimes the lack of focus is there.   After they drop the food, they should come back within 1-2 minutes to see how everything is.  We were fine, but don't disappear until it's time for the check and my water glass is bone dry because I've chewed up all the ice cubes.  

The dining room is one big room with the bar on the north side, and I think if we go back we'd sit at the bar.  That seemed to be pretty lively which I always enjoy.  The only thing I didn't like about one big open room was the toddler across the way bellowing his needs for all to hear.  His complaints echoed through the entire room.  I see from the pictures there's some outdoor seating so maybe next time we'll give that a try.  Overall a pretty good first visit and I wouldn't shy away from going back."}
{"text":"Wow! We live in the neighborhood and have been to The Groves once before but never again! We ordered chips and salsa from the happy hour menu and didn't get them until after I received my dinner salad.  My blue cheese dressing taste like cucumber, watered down ranch weirdness.  Our server and a number of others continually asked how everything was and I could barely hold back from telling them that it was horrible.  What do you say when everything taste horrible?  Dinner arrived and my first bite was an eye opener.  It was like dipping my fork in salt.  Everything taste the same.  Salt with a little meat and potato. My wife ordered a quesadilla and all you could taste was salt.  This is a sure sign of a very bad cook.  The only good thing was the seasonal beer I had and the live music.  Service and food poor.  Never will we return!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of The Groves.  You can bring your dog and relax outside.  A main reason I go is to see the server, Levi.  He is so friendly and funny.  He makes you feel like you are visiting his home and you have been friends forever.  I recommend the buffalo chicken salad."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, my wife and I have been coming here for years. Today service was Very Slow. Toast was cold and eggs undercooked.  Wait staff was polite and apologetic. When the manager came over, he said their \"Kitchen is really small so there trying to keep up\". REALLY?  That's what you tell customers? They were not packed, I would say 75% full.  In summary, just plain disappointing, this use to be a good place. Doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Crocs with Socks and a Side o' Tots

I've lived in Gilbert for almost a year now.  We've been to The Groves about a half dozen times, and no doubt I'll keep coming back.  It's definitely one of our local favorites because it's close to home, reasonably priced, locally owned, and super laid back.  

They have a decent beer selection, and ....the garlic tots are no joke.  There are 3 or 4 different selections of tots on the dinner menu.   These guys serve various tots!  I knew on my first visit that my relationship with this establishment had potential.  A pile of garlic tots, a few rounds of beer, and some live music playing covers of old favorites on a Friday night after a long week - what's not to love?  

For those that are giving The Groves a poor review, it is what it is, which is why I personally like it.  I like it a lot.  I mean, on Sunday mornings there is a man dressed as bacon spinning a sign to advertise breakfast.   I think you can't walk into an establishment where the owner is rockin' neon Crocs and have French Laundry expectations."}
{"text":"Parents told me about this place went I went to AZ for a visit. Had the Reuben sandwich and seasoned fries. The Reuben was one of the better ones I've ever had and at a good price. The server, Jasmine, was fast and attentive."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, fabulous patio set-up, excellent server and the food reminded me of Home.  Not the home where I live and make things in the microwave!  I mean that OTHER HOME where Mom lives and whips up real food from real ingredients.

Go.  Try.  Enjoy.  Repeat.

Mac n Cheese is a Spoon Experience not to be missed - sliced jalapenos were a nice touch too!"}
{"text":"The all you can eat fish was mediocre.  The good....the cole slaw....excellent, not to much mayonnaise and a great vinegar and sweet tastes.  The O.K....the fish, very greasy and the grease over-powered the fish.  Not awful, just not good.  The bad...the \"hush puppies\", were not good at all!  They were chewy dough and not crispy on the outside and soft on the inside...just balls of chewy dough, and no taste of corn meal!  The service was O.K., but it took 35 minutes to get my meal, at the bar, with no drink!  I opted not to get the \"all u can eat\" because it took to long, and the fish wasn't worth it.

The music was good, and  I'll come back to give them another chance, but for something other that fried fish!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. I went in there with 5 friends. I cannot comment on the food or drinks because they were out of every drink we ordered and I am talking about obvious liquor labels. No Makers Mark, no Ketel One, no Hornito's Tequila... The waitress acted like we were putting her out by asking for specific brands of liquor. We left after 5 or 6 minutes and will never go back."}
{"text":"Low-key cafe style restaurant with a traditional menu.  Service was a delight; everyone was on top of it.

Comfort food - breakfast was DELICIOUS.  I had an omelet with potatoes on the side with a cup of coffee.  

Next time I'm in town I would absolutely go again."}
{"text":"My husband took my 2.5 year old and me to breakfast for Mother's Day. The service was extremely nice, but yes, a little slow.  Once we received our food, it was fabulous!  They give you so much food for your money and it is just like mom used to make.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great! We found this little gem after church on Sunday while trying to get into The Gilbert House. I'm glad we didn't wait! The food here is homemade and is absolutely delicious! Corned beef hash isn't your mushy \"cat food\" but hand sliced corned beef with big cubes of potatoes. The stuffed french toast is really good too. Taco salad was great with no skimping on the tomatoes, olives and guac. My husbands favorite is the Philly. You MUST try the Jalapeno poppers. Not your typical poppers...stuffed with cream cheese, wrapped in bacon and grilled. Unbelievable! 
Try this place out, but not when in a hurry. This is a laid back staff with (mostly) laid back customers that are there to enjoy some time. It's our new favorite local spot!"}
{"text":"Having returned 6-8 months later, and a wonderful breakfast with premium service.  Dennis, family and staff made this a very relaxing and enjoyable choice in Gilbert.  The secret is out, give them a try.....you won't be disappointed.  Walt and Kyle"}
{"text":"Felt like having some pizza so went in on a Friday afternoon.  Arrived at 3:40pm.  Was told I could not have pizza until after 4pm so ordered the fish.  It was ok.  They advertise pizza on the menu all day.  Very misleading.  Also, cocktail was watered down and very expensive."}
{"text":"Just spent Mother's Day breakfast here and the staff was very friendly!! Food was good and very fairly priced!! We will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"This place is basic.  The food is not fresh and it tastes like it.  The bar scene is cool and the patio is awesome.  It's not HORRIBLE but it's not the first place I'll think of when I want a good meal.  However, I'd probably return but just eat before hand ;-)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is actually a bar. Not a bar and grill, it is a bar, that decided to serve food during the daylight hours.  The food was completely unmemorable.  We will not go back."}
{"text":"I've only been here for breakfast (on two different occasions).  
Once on a busy Saturday morning.  Short wait.  Service was friendly.  Food was good. 
The next visit was early on a Tuesday Morning, just as they opened.  Food was hot and tasty.  
Very clean establishment.
Will be back."}
{"text":"Been waiting almost an hour for a meal as simple as breakfast. Even our waitress was frustrated with the kitchen wait time."}
{"text":"Disappointed. This place has massive potential. Super cute location. However for beginning to end not great service. Woman who greeted us wasn't very pleasant. Took 20 min to seat us with no visual wait. Sat us on the patio, bird poop on our table. Took 50 min to get our food. Husband ordered French toast, they did not bring out syrup. 15 min later and after asking 3 people he finally got syrup. Seen our \"original\" waiter once. Someone else came to ask how we were. Then someone else brought our food, then someone else brought our syrup and the. Someone else brought our check.
And the food was just average, nothing to boast about.
:("}
{"text":"My parents told me about this place and I really wanted to love it because they do, they met the owners and had a fabulous time there.  I wish I could say the same.

I ordered a Bloody Mary and asked the bartender not to put Tabasco sauce in it but she didn't really acknowledge me.  So when my drink came and it was too hot to drink, I reminded her that I had asked for it without the Tabasco.  She informed me that its not made with Tabasco, it a special blend of habenaros and other spices.  Okay, it's my fault for not specifying that I don't like my Bloodys spicy.  Whatever.  I ask her to take it back and another woman, presumably the manager, tells her to tone it down with orange juice.  So she gives me the bloody back, with OJ and asks me if I like it, I said yes because I'm a push over and I didn't want to send the drink back again.  Seriously though, it tasted like something my friends and I concocted in 5th grade from everything in my parents liquor cabinet - the worst beverage, something you'd drink as a dare.  

The food wasn't much better.  The potatoes were cold, not just room temperature but literally cold.

I really want this place to make it, it has a lot of potential and I love supporting local businesses.  I hope they get their act together."}
{"text":"As soon as I discovered this place, I was excited for what I expected to be one of my new local favorites...

I was slightly torn on how to describe my impression and experience but the only word that suites is underwhelmed.  It was not the worst I have had and not nearly the best but I absolutely expected more.  The outside of The Groves is adorable and inviting while the inside is eclectic and comfortable.  The bar, where we sat, was lined with what seemed like local regulars enjoying coffee and newspapers (I thought this was a great sign!).  

If I based my rating on the service, it would have earned one star and I feel that is generous.  I have a great deal of patience with service  and understand  a bad day, chaos behind the scenes, being short staffed, new employees, etc.  I wish I could say any of those were the case.  We were seated for a good amount of time before we were greeted by the male \"bartender\"...then asked which drinks we'd like...then much longer to order...and even longer to actually get the food (you get the picture)  Our burger took almost 30 minutes.  Aside from our personal service, the bartender seemed scattered and was unsure of how to make a number of drinks. Rather than asking someone for help, he sent them out and was later corrected by a server who delivered the clearly incorrect drinks to the table anyway.  

I will be the first to admit that the more hungry I get, the less patient I become.  However, my biggest irritation came from the bartender complaining, loudly, to the serving staff about a meeting they had to attend after their shifts.  We had to hear the staff 'gossip' while we were sitting without any update on our meal, eventually calling him over to request that he check on it.  Unfortunately, it didn't stop there as we dined over the ambiance of their complaints through the duration of our visit, it was completely uncomfortable. 

Two more stars???  The management can thank the back of the house for these ones.  Despite the long wait, the burger was OUTSTANDING.  It looked amazing and tasted even better.  The meat was cooked perfectly and was incredibly juicy.  The bun was soft and the veggies were crisp and fresh.  It was the kind of burger that drips down your hands as it is being eaten, perfect.  The burger came with a side of fries which I could have done without.  They were soggy and WAY too greasy; Yes, I know fries are supposed to be greasy but they literally looked wet and tasted like oil.  I don't know that I have every passed up a fry but I did that day.  That didn't even matter though because the burger was incredibly filling, even split into two.

I hope that the management passes this  feedback along to their staff, good and bad.  I have never been one to write a negative review but this dining experience really stood out to me."}
{"text":"Apparently this place is under new ownership. Who knew. Doesn't say anywhere on the website and sure is no indication that the menu has changed also but alas, it has. No more reindeer sausage, the only reason I made the 20 minute drive. Sat down at the bar and waited over 10 minutes for a menu and only got it after I asked for it to then be told that it is still under construction and 1/2 the stuff isn't available yet. And yes, no more reindeer sausage. So we got up and left after asking for the check and not getting a pen to sign the receipt. What a disappointment. One star was generous."}
{"text":"I am increasing my rating to three stars because the staff did their best, but hopefully the owners find a way to make needed changes."}
{"text":"My favorite part of the meal was the cinnamon roll!  It was the perfect appetizer and dessert."}
{"text":"As usual they were out of something in the menu! Which is one of the reasons  why I have not been here in a while. Somehow decided to give it a go and my wife said \"you know they are going to be missing something\" and to my dismay as history goes it repeats itself. Very disappointing! The food is great!! Our server was great, the owner is a really good guy, I WILL BE BACK (that guy has us hooked). 

THE THING THAT REALLY ANGERS ME IS THE FACT THAT I CAN'T STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.

BEST PRIME RIB SANDWICH...."}
{"text":"Called at 1:53 and was told lunch special s end at 2 so no go. Very disappointing they would turn down business with 7 minutes to spare."}
{"text":"We had some family in town and we decided to come here because there was a bar and Tv's to enjoy March madness. We waited 30 minutes for a table which is pretty standard for a Sunday morning anywhere. Once we were sat it took 15 mins for someone to come and take our drink orders and food orders. The food took so long to come out that we waited 50 mins and then decided to leave because we had no clue when our food was coming out and our guest needed to get on the road. We asked to pay for our drinks that we had ordered and the owner came to our table to apologize. It just would have been nice if our server made frequent rounds to let us know that our food was delayed but once we got our drinks that was the last time we saw our server. It's really nice to see family owned restaurants that cook from scratch but it would have been nice if they knew how to expedite their orders because I would say that 2 other tables complained about their food taking so long as we sat waiting for ours. Needless to say, it was really embarrassing taking our guest here and having that experience. I hope the next time I visit they step up their game."}
{"text":"I went for breakfast to see what their sign on the street boasting a $3.75 \"Homemade Breakfast\" was all about. 2 eggs and toast.  The eggs and toast were fine. I ordered a side of gravy as a previous post was sort of negative about it, now I understand why. Salty doesn't even begin to describe it.

I told the waiter, he went back and took a taste test and said, \"yep, he needs to make a new batch\" 

Overall, I have to cross this place off the list of places to try. No silver spoon here."}
{"text":"I don't do many yelp reviews but I had to take a minute to this one. We went to The Groves earlier this week and we were the first customers of the day (a bit early) anyway when we arrived it turned out that the server was not in yet for the day, instead of being turned away we were taken care of by one of the cooks named Bob, I've got to tell you that this guy was a one man show and I've got to give a SHOUT OUT! Other tables had also shown up and Bob was so helpful, polite, funny and informative he took our orders then went and cooked them, cleaned our table and checked us and many other tables out. HE WAS RUNNING THE PLACE LIKE A BOSS, always smiling and seemed like he enjoyed himself as we enjoyed a wonderful breakfast. I will for sure be a regular here and should encourage anyone to try The Groves Bar and Grille, the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Had an open faced turkey sandwich that was terrible. Sliced deli turkey - and not even good deli turkey at that - covered with a salty, canned brown gravy.  Even the smashed potatoes were tasteless and watery, and couldn't save this meal.

The wait staff was friendly and attentive,  but describing the soup of the day as \" kind of a broth, and it has vegetables\" is not how one should be selling the soup.

If I come back again, I'll stick to burgers or sandwiches, and stay away from the dinner entrees."}
{"text":"Great service, frendly staff. Food was average for breakfast. Still need to check out dinner service."}
{"text":"The groves is very good food.  They have American food.  Burgers, salads, sandwiches, breakfast, etc.  I have always been pleased with their food.  Breakfast is amazing, the club sandwich is as big as a 10 year old's head!  I highly recommend this place.  The cook and staff are great; plus it is priced very well."}
{"text":"NOW I KNOW WHERE TO GO WHILE THE SHEEPLE STAND IN LINE IN 110 DEGREE HEAT IN OLD TOWN GILBERT !
My girl and i left the bbq joint with a 20ft line and Oregeno's wirh people sweating outside and tried out the Groves grill. Right down the block.

I had the patty melt and my fiance had the prime rib sandwich.
The fries are rough cut home made and are delicious.
The only way i can describe both sandwiches is love.....because both of those had love in them.
The patty melt was delicious with sauteed red onions and the prime rib was served with au ju and horse radish sauce.
They also serve breakfast and do 2.25 domestic beers and food for happy hour.
But hey.....if you like being a hipster and standing on line...go for it!!

Update: 8/16/14
Just had my first breakfast at the groves on a sunday morning in August.
The place was packed and the staff did a great job at handling the masses.
Good coffee, home fries and pancakes.
They are huge and a short stack is only 2.....huge portion!
Their cinny buns are the size of a bowling ball!! Look out!!
Sadly, i will not be able to get near this place in snowbird season if it is packed in august.  :("}
{"text":"Lots of potential but extremely slow service, food not ready at same time, and one guy in our party had very raw sausage in his gravy. Quite disappointed and will not be returning"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time today for breakfast . We sat on the back patio which was beautiful . I had the country breakfast which was 3 eggs , bacon (you can choose sausage) , a biscuit and a cup of gravy. The eggs and bacon were average , but the biscuit and gravy were  to die for!! I have never had a biscuit so fluffy and soft before .. My bf had a short stack of pancakes (warning !!! These pancakes were made by uncle buck  i swear they had to have flipped them with a snow shovel. they were so BIG) and so Delish . He also got a side of bacon and a side of breakfast potatoes . I think I will give this place another try ,and see if I get anything  a little more memorable ..."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical after reading some of the reviews but to be perfectly honest, the food and drinks were great. We got quite a few different items between all of us: wings, salad, pizza, hamburger, kids grilled cheese, chicken fried steak, chili, and spinach artichoke dip. Everything tasted great and was presented very well. I am very picky about what I eat and is food was excellent. The drinks were good too. I ordered a margarita and the rest of the party ordered beer & cocktails. They came fast and were not lacking. The service was good too despite the place being packed. Our waitress was attentive and our plates were always being cleared. The dining room is a bit small so if you get there during peak hours, sit at the bar or expect a wait. It has really nice ambiance and is great for families. I recommend going here. Try it out!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! We went on a Friday night and they had live music playing oldies (but goodies). The music was quiet enough that you could still enjoy close conversation without shouting. We had the all you can eat fish fry which was Alaskan cod fried to perfection, a bunch of fries, and the most delicious hush puppies I've ever had. The slaw was good too; it tasted somewhat sweet with a hint of pineapple and dried cranberries. The service was out of this world! It's family owned and operated. One of the owners even grabbed us a loaf of fresh bread from their bakery next door to take home with us; only $3 and some change for fresh delicious bread! My sister and her boyfriend joined us later on and they ordered the scookie which was a large skillet baked cookie covered in ice cream. Yum!!! I will be back for sure!!!! Great for date night or even the whole family."}
{"text":"Second time with new owners...only two tables...soup took 23min and cold...burgers fell apart  and served with  soup...over last 3 years have enjoyed food and service...but no more...fri lunch two weeks ago was soup and fish and chips for 7.99 now It is 9.99 without soup???"}
{"text":"Staff was really nice. Selection of bakery items all looked.. sort of blech. Nothing that made me think \"ooh that looks good\". We ended up getting a thing called a \"s'more\" (graham crust with marshmallow and chocolate on the inside) and 3 brownie bites that had frosting on the them. They looked cute and I hoped they'd be tasty. The s'more thing was \"ok\" but tasted artificially flavored. I won't say it wasn't good. But it tasted 'previously frozen'.  It was .99 though, and so I guess for the price that's about right. I would say though, that for something home-made, I'd pay three times that. 

The brownie bites were HORRIBLE though. Bought three for a couple bucks (2-something). They tasted like they were frozen without being covered appropriately. Freezer-burn. But they had a distinct flavor of garlic or something. Plus, texture-wise they were no better than a box of those brownie bites you might get from Costco or something. While I'm not saying it's wrong to buy pre made items and turn around and sell them, I do think it's a bit mis-leading to call yourself a bakery. Plus, if you're going to do that, you should at least store them in a way that keeps them tasting like whatever they're supposed to be and not whatever they were stored next to. 

To be fair though: obviously there were quite a few items we did NOT try. They had a few lovely pictures of wedding cakes as well, that I couldn't comment on regarding quality. So take this review for what it is, based on what few items we tried. 

However, based on those few items (however low priced), I really don't think we'd be back to try anything else."}
{"text":"Go somewhere else! This was the worst chix fried steak I've ever eaten. the meat tasted ground processed then re assembled. ..the gravy was separated and u could see the grease oozing out of it. not to mention my over medium eggs that were over hard on bottom side and sunny on top...snotty eggs ruin it for me. potatoes were good but no options to add onion or peppers.one half star only because service was nice young girl but not thorough with coming back around or knowledgeable about how food should be presented. ...I would never have brought what they served me out to a customer and claim that it was normal. stick to the toast."}
{"text":"Alright, I think I've figured this place out now...

We stopped by here for a couple of burgers, and I'll tell you what... those were some SATISFYING hamburgers. We ordered the bacon-wrapped jalape?o poppers, and they were easily the best we've ever had (I'm a bit of a jalapeño popper snob, and I've had a LOT in my time). They slice them very carefully when they seed them, fill the peppers with cream cheese, then wrap a strip of bacon around them and bake to perfection. They were great, and I'm pretty sure that we'll be ordering them on every visit henceforth.

So we enjoyed our poppers, and our burgers came out in a very timely fashion. As soon as they sat them down in front of us, I looked at my girlfriend and solemnly pronounced that they were some seriously good looking burgers. She agreed, and we proceeded to stuff our faces in burgery bliss. The fries were also delicious, and walked the perfect line balancing between crispiness and softness. All in all, they were some damned tasty burgers and we'll definitely be back for them. We've had some mixed experiences at this place (the service has always been exemplary, but sometimes the food was a little on the 'meh' side) but after tonight, this will be our go-to burger place."}
{"text":"We usually come for bfast and the service is fast, coffee is great, people are friendly and down to earth. I have dietary issues and they are always willing to help me out."}
{"text":"Came in for some live music and dinner.  I had their Green Chile burger and my companion had the Guacamole burger. Both were served on a pretzel bun with spicy Jack cheese.   We agree it's one of the better burgers we've had in a long time. And our server, Cathy, was great!  Coming back for breakfast soon."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough how much we love this spot! Gorgeous location and a breakfast/brunch favorite! It's just far enough away from the \"strip\" that is downtown Gilbert that it isn't swamped with people all the time. We love enjoying mimosas and bloody Mary's there on the weekend!"}
{"text":"After eating 50+ breakfasts at The Groves, I finally went there for Dinner. This ISN'T your usual bar food restaurant. I had the stuffed chicken (Chicken stuffed with a walnut sauce) ... it was excellent. Had a seasonal beer Santan Brewery ... a perfect meal. One of the better restaurants in Gilbert"}
{"text":"Great food, great bar, and they have the best wine tasting once a month. They also have \"party nights\" with different themes.  It's a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"I want to like this place so badly, but both times we've tried, we've left disappointed. They have a lovely backyard area for breakfast when its nice out. Breakfast is nothing special but an egg is an egg and the scenery is nice.
Tried it again yesterday and when we arrived, the place was totally dead. We ordered sandwiches and a chicken tender kids meal. They put down our sandwiches and we see that they are not at all as we ordered them, so the server asks the kitchen to make another.
 We were there around 3 pm when the afternoon crew arrives to perform a very loud,  very public shift change, in which the afternoon servers, ( they come in at 3, the place closes at 7. Don't try to make sense of it, its ridiculous).  arrive, and in the middle of the dining room, start putting on their aprons and pulling their hair back, and then our server comes over and announces that she is leaving. 
New server comes with our \"corrected\" order, and they are still wrong. My husband says, there's still no cheese on my Reuben, and she looks at it, does an awkward giggle, and says oh no! Then leaves. Never saw her again until she brought the check.
It is then that I notice my child's chicken tenders. Oh. My. God. The amount of black pepper in the breading would have killed a linebacker. My husband asked if they were burned, and I said no, its all pepper.
These are great for adults, or perhaps an endurance challenge, but my lord make a separate breading for kids meals before you kill someone. 
And that really sums up the food- nobody there cares about the what they put out. There's no love in it, no thought. You can literally taste the indifference."}
{"text":"the fish needed to be fried a little crisper but the club was good and the beer was nice and cold."}
{"text":"All around Average. Average burger,  wine, atmosphere, and service. We were there on a Monday and it turns out that they had stayed open late for us. It was 8 and they closed at 7."}
{"text":"Love my neighborhood restaurant. Looking forward to a more extensive dinner menu and later hours. Food has been very tasty. Some items a little salty. Staff has been very nice. We will continue to support local business owners."}
{"text":"I have been a few times for lunch and a few times for dinner - great food and service!  Yes, they did run out of one of the specials once, but I think that is to be expected.  Very attentive service and I loved the live music on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Went for a pre-Mother's Day breakfast with my daughter and friend this morning.  This was the first visit for all of us.  We were originally seated inside, but discovered the wonderful patio out back, and were reseated with no issues.  Our server, Warren, was superb!!  The food was OMG Wonderful.  Two of us had the Country Benedict - AWESOME!!!  The third breakfast was Corned Beef Hash with real corned beef!!  All three of us were very pleased with the food and the service.  We will return and bring friends along!!"}
{"text":"Ate there on a Sunday morning. Went with son and grandson (8). Waited about 10 minutes to be seated. Which is not too bad for a Sunday in Gilbert. The service was great food came very fast. Everything was good. The only food item that was not very good was the gravy on the biscuits and gravy. Nobody liked it. Everything else was very very good. I will be back again. But no biscuits and gravy for me. Hopefully next time though have a good white sausage based gravy. Not brown."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast on Sunday morning and was seated immediately when other nearby restaurants had lines out the door.  Guess that should have been my first clue.  All the staff was very nice and efficient, the food was just not worth the price.

The breakfast menu won't load on their web page so I'll have to do this from memory.  I had a California style omelet with spinach, onions, white cheese (maybe swiss) and avocado slices on top.  It came with homestyle potatoes and toast.  Pretty standard stuff.  It was o.k.  My 10 year old ordered french toast with blueberries and bacon.  The french toast was buried under a huge ladle of what must have been frozen blueberries.  My son didn't eat any of it.  I scrapped the blueberry sauce off and tried the french toast myself.  Not much flavor just soggy bread.  The bacon came out on a plate all stuck together in the form that you buy in the store.  Like the cook counted off like 6/8 strips pulled them off  in a chunk and stuck them in the deep fryer.  It was a thin cheap bacon and my son didn't eat more than a couple bites.  With my coffee and his iced tea the bill was like $25 and some change.

I watched as others were served massive plates of breakfast.  NEWS FLASH....we don't need these huge portions just GOOD food.  I have to say it is embarrassing to be served a plate that could feed a small village in Africa.  My son (or anyone else) did not need to be served 6/8 pieces of bacon.  How about 2 of a great quality bacon cooked well?  We have local vendors that sell wonderful bacon.  

There seemed to be two ladies that were checking on everyone (maybe the owners) and one did ask me if everything was o.k. as we were getting ready to leave.  At that point I really just wanted to get out of there.  There wasn't anything they could say at that point to make me want to come back.  It was not like I had an over cooked steak they could remake....this is their menu and they are watching the plates go out so there is not anything I could say except...meh, good luck staying in business."}
{"text":"This place I terrible. Terrible customer service, terrible drinks, terrible food. The best thing I ordered was a beer and that probably because they can't mess it up."}
{"text":"We live nearby and have given the Groves ample chances to up the star rating before writing the review, but it's just not in the cards. It's obvious they use a microwave to reheat things because a lot times a platter will arrive and the food is various temperatures. 

The final straw was a couple of weeks ago we went with our inlaws and ordered standard food (wings, burgers, and a salad). If you're a \"Bar & Grill\" you should have wing making mastered. Well, my husband's wings arrived and the center of them was ice cold. We were told by the server that there was a party of 20 on the patio so the cook was just trying to get the food out. That's not our problem, and undercooked chicken can make a person really sick. So that will be the last time we go to the Groves. 

Also, they only serve breakfast until 1pm on Saturday and Sunday, so if you walk in at 1:15, you're not getting it."}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed with this place. I found out, after I got there, that they no longer serve pizza. We all ordered fish and chips and all three of us were dissatisfied with the choice. Cannot exactly put my finger on it, but I got the feeling that no one in the place was really happy to see customers come thru the door. To be fair, the food was acceptable - not exceptional."}
{"text":"The bar and grill had a fun environment. This is an english pub style establishment with great food, efficient service and live music on the weekends. The menu was refreshing because of the dishes you were able to get, the options are different from most places. I recommend this place if your in the mood for something  a little different."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place very much. Had a great burger. We sat outside, and the only downside was the place next door started mowing their lawn at 7:30 pm, and it kicked up alot of dust. This was not the fault of the restaurant of course, and they took care of it very quickly for us too. I would like to go back and try some of their other food!"}
{"text":"Pleck.. I should have known driving by with the midteen sign spinner dressed in a bacon costume that this was going to an event I would regret. 

The atmosphere is tolerable, nothing glamours. The servers are nice but not overly lustrous and the food is boring at best.. Yes, I did indeed regret some of my choices today. 

I ordered the omelette at the servers recommendations, hint #1 should have been his vague, eye rolling selection over the eggs Benedict. Next time I'll follow my gut. I was informed that all their items are \"large\", what our definitions are might be a bit different from each other. \"Large\" would be gross oversell, average would be a more accurate representation. Bacon, tomato and avocado omelette it is, the crossfit games were on, I felt powerful and motivated; hold the cheese please. What arrived was a sad disappointment and left me pondering my own pantry and my last minute Rachel Ray talents. A thin eggy shell of a bacon tomato mash was presented to me covered with an avocado slice, luckily no cheese.. Good news is that I cut my calories significantly by not consuming ALL of the bacon in my omelette, sad news is that I would have been better off to order scrambled eggs, a side of soggy bacon and a tomato garnish accompanied by carelessly cut warmed unseasoned potatoes instead. 

Where is the effort and attention to details my friends? My half hearted last minute attempt at imagining my breakfast was better than what I just ate. 

I'm so underwhelmed. 

Sadly I saw quite a few other menu items walk by (with my server who when time to leave was in no hurry to turn his table and accommodate the newly arriving patrons standing at the door) that did appear to be quite intriguing,  I was jus not fortunate enough to order then myself. 

I can't say I'll be back, the bacon costume tricked me once but I won't be had a second time now knowing better."}
{"text":"Love this place. A neighborhood pizza and bar joint with great pizzas and wonderful jalapeno poppers. Not like you have had before.  The cajun wings were very good and the price for all was right. Good music on Fridays at around 6:30p."}
