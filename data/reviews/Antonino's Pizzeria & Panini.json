Pizza is yummy and fresh"}
{"text":"I've been a regular for a long while. I work in Markham and would make the trek for lunch and have their fabulous veal or panzzarotta.  Live in Richmond Hill and would order a party size pizza for take out. Food is home made, delicious, not expensive and staff always have a smile.  Definitely worth a try then you too will be a regular."}
{"text":"Great food, been here many times with family including my toddler son. Sometimes a long wait but that's a good sign of great food!"}
{"text":"Pizza is overrated with the cheese being way too salty! Their rice balls how we are fantastic and we only go there for the rice balls now."}
{"text":"I love pizza !! If I could change my name it would be associated with pizza some how !!! Tired of our local pizza joints and in pursuit of finding one that touches my soul, I asked the Yelp gurus for help and they did not disappoint !! Antonino's Pizzeria is amazing !!! Perfect crust, good amount of toppings, homemade pizza sauce to die for and a great cheese combination to top it all off !! Ordered a party size pizza with tomatoes, green peppers, mushrooms and black olives. The pizza kisses my soul and waved back at it !!! Met the owner Mr. Antonio himself who was very pleasant to chat with. Nothing beats service with a smile and genuine concern for their customer. My parents are vegetarian so I asked about the possibility of a veg lasagna to which Antonio advised they do make veg lasagna and if I gave a days notice he would prepare an amazing lasagna !!! Love it when they actually care for you !!! If you're in the Vaughan/Maple area, drop in and say hi to Antonio and have your soul taken away by their amazing pizza !!!"}
{"text":"Top notch  Italian pizza. Value and taste are two criteria I use for pizza and Antonio's fits the bill. Found them on yelp,thanks for that...pleasant counter staff_you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We usually order pizza from Antonino's once a month and it is always great. 
Love the sauce and the crust. 
Ordered 2 pizzas tonight for my daughter's b-day party and it was Stellar!
I would highly recommend Antonino's on any given day. 
I need to get in and try some other menu items as I am sure they are excellent as welll"}
{"text":"Have ordered from here before and it was great. Tonight was disappointing....not only the pizza but most of all, the way it was handled. Our pizza was so wet and doughy, it broke the centre of the box. Called and after being told that out toppings were wet and this is why it happened, we were offered a new pizza....didn't want that as it's 830pm and we are starving....didn't want to wait.....they did offer to deliver it which was nice but not what we wanted.....at the end of it we were offered a $10 credit for next time. The pizza was $25. Not sure how a $25 pizza that they screwed up is worth $10? Too bad Anthony doesn't know how to right a wrong.....would have understood that stuff happens and sometimes the food takes a hit but the response back to the customer should always be good.....if only they took the right steps....."}
{"text":"Excellent family run bizz. Wife and I frequent often with great service and food.Hands down one of the best Italian home cooked restaurants in Vaughan."}
{"text":"The pizza and panzos are the best if they get our order right.  I can't tell you how many times we order for pick up and our orders are completely wrong.  I would eat there more often if I knew the order would be correct because their food is terrific!"}
{"text":"I don't know what all the rave is. This place is not consistent. First time was nice medium crust made well, but second time the crust was completely different, it was very thin and crispy. Did not enjoy it."}
{"text":"Just went here for lunch today after reading all the great reviews! It is a good restaurant. Small family restaurant but great staff that welcome you when you arrive. Not much of a wait. Fresh healthy hot food! Italian restaurant with sandwiches salads and pizza pasta etc."}
{"text":"Awesome panini and pasta! Great family business atmosphere. The Caesar salad is especially good."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. I only came here because a friend highly recommended it, and drove me there.

Why have I not known about this place?

Upon coming in, they know you weren't a regular.  They know all their customers. They watch their kids grow up. Family goes there regularly for a meal. It's like a inviting extended family.

So my friend recommended a Rose Sauce ravioli, and we order another soupy tortellini. Both were delicious - I wanted more. lots more... if only my stomach would allow.

The pasta here was mind blowing - basic, simple, but reminds you of this nonna warmth. Forget about other expensive places - come here for the great price and no frill atmosphere. 

If you are on the way to Vaughan Mills to shop from the east side - even better. You got to load up in carbs before your wallet empties.

I'd shall be back until my next shopping trip."}
{"text":"Went back and dined in. Pizza was amazing as was the pasta that came with the kid's meals. The pizza that we took out was bad but they have redeemed themselves with the meal we had last night."}
{"text":"Finished 24 slices between my girlfriend and I. Not a big fan of most pizza. Will be coming back here. Great price and quality."}
{"text":"First off here's how I like my pizza:
1) most important: tomato sauce. Is it to herby?  Too garlicy? 
2) when you take a bite, do the entire toppings come with it on first bite?
3) crust

Now onto my review:

First time today at this place as I was making a pitstop with my fianc√© here before shopping at Vaughan mills.

I cannot begin to express how good their customer service was. Deserves at least 10 stars!

We ordered the partysize special with one topping (prosciutto for us!) for a GREAT price!! (available 7 days a week too!)

Let me tell you, this pizza was extremely well made. 

The sauce was not overloaded nor was it too scarce. Just the perfect amount of roastness from the oven.

We were eating this while driving as well, so it was amazing that you can fold the little squares they cut it into, and take bites WITHOUT all the toppings falling off! 

Crust was juuusttt crispy on the outside with a very nice chewyness in the middle.

Extremely well balanced ratio between topping:cheese:sauce:crust, and they are Very generous with their prosciutto!  

Only gripe is that the parking was small because I'm going to recommend EVERYONE to this place.

Looking forward to trying the veal next!"}
{"text":"Place is kind of small to eat in but very cosy.  Food is hands down the best italian I've had in Toronto! Their tomato sauce is to die for! Customer service is second to none! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst pizzas I've eaten.It was marginally better than a frozen one.Very dry and tasteless .I can't believe people like the pizza here
They claim it's the best pizza in Canada.
Seriously????"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?

This is the spot! Best panzo I ever had it is even better then bitundos! the pizza is very top notch its up there with the best of them, The veal is really good as well! Pretty good spot with quality in all areas on the menu. Prices are fair also. Very friendly staff you can tell they are greatful. 

This is the real deal."}
{"text":"Location: 1801 Rutherford Road, Concord, ON L4K 5R7
Price: $$ 
Service: GOOD

This is one of my favourite fast food pizzeria! I really enjoy this place because they make really good thin crust pizzas. Another great thing they have are chicken wings which are flavourful- so yummy! On top of that, their French fries are awesome; just the right amount of crispy. Love fries! 

I haven't had their lasagna in a long time. But from what I remember it was 8 or 9 bucks and you definitely get a fair amount for that price. This place is cheap, friendly, and delicious- you can't really go wrong with this place. It is a hidden gem in the area of Vaughan for sure! 

Verdict: amazeballs"}
{"text":"When my children were at preschool they used to have their pizza lunch on Fridays from antoninos. The pizza is delicious.  We haven't tried pasta and we've never eaten-in but the pizza is very good and reasonably priced when you pick up. Yum,"}
{"text":"Best pickup lasagna in Woodbridge / Vaughan area.  Man I wish they would start up delivery again, but I guess they don't need to, there's always a line up for pickup orders.  

Everything is good on the menu, but I would avoid party sizes, stick to large at most.  As always I order thin crust well done, which goes without saying at most American style pizza joints."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Got take out, ended up ordering large one topping pepperoni and ordered 10 wings (mild). Pizza is amazing, marinara sauce is delicious as well as the dough. Quality of the wings were really good, only concern is lack of flavours to choose from."}
{"text":"Ok I've been a little out to lunch with how bomb the pizza is here. I went many years ago but don't remember it being that good. Anyways these guys are pretty much the best pie in the area which says quite a bit. Delicious, fresh tomato sauce and the crust is chewy and just perfect. Need to make up for lost time now."}
{"text":"The pizza was just okay I was not that thrilled for my first time I probably would not eat here again I did not care for the hard crust"}
{"text":"Probably the most tender veal on a bun I've ever had. Service was quick and friendly. And yet something keeps me from rating it 5 stars... The taste just didn't blow me away I guess. 

It was still very good though! I would like to try the pizza which looked good and all the good reviews seem to talk about."}
{"text":"Blessed from day one !! Love this family owned business. Been going here since public school and now I'm a uni student. Amazing pasta, veal, sandwiches, pizza, everything !!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a Vaughan gem. It's small, clean, good atmosphere and very conducive to a good, quick, casual Italian meal. We've had the pasta, veal sandwich, salads, and they're all delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"So glad I found this hidden gem! Everything here is so fresh. I always get their pizzas, pasta with meat sauce, and ravioli with rose sauce. Simply delicious!"}
{"text":"Best pizza!  Super impressed the first time we had takeout.  Usual order is party size with wings or pasta."}
{"text":"This place NEVER EVER disappoints.  My Panzerotti was made by the owner to perfection.  He has got to be the nicest guy in this world.  SO generous and made us feel so good.  I will return all the time when i crave delicious italian food.  BTW....the tomato sauce is the best that I have ever tasted.  Im a great cook but I still can't match HIS sauce.  Thank for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Excellent tomato sauce on the gnocchi. Fairly priced, friendly service. The pizza was good, but my child said the garlic bread was even better. She only had a pizza slice and to be honest the whole pizzas coming out of the oven looked a lot better than the individual slices, so maybe next time we get a whole pie."}
{"text":"This place has great service and food! Their pizza is just out of this world, one of the best places for pizza in vaughan.

Never had an issue with food every time I've ordered and their prices are the average price for food in vaughan. I always order their rice balls, and their tortellini. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The pizza place to come to in the Thornhill Dufferin and Rutherford area.  Servicing the neighbourhood for over 10 years.  They are best pizzas not only in Thornhill but was ranked as the pizza for Canada two years ago Sapputo's best Neighbourhood Canadian Pizza. 

A monstrous party size pizza for $17.99 with home sauce great cheese and any topping.

I come here anytime I need to feed my family and/or large groups in a pinch.  The food is always reliable fresh and tasty.

The owners are working in the back making sure that every customer is happy and satisfied with every meal that is served out of the kitchen.

Other great options are the pasta, salads and sandwiches all great.

The place is not fancy and most people take out and not dine in. But it will seat 20 to 40 people depending on the night and it is very cozy.

This place is no way a fancy place but it is a local great Pizzeria and is recommended by anyone in the area as one of the better choices."}
{"text":"Parking: Medium size lot with plenty of free parking.

Washrooms: They were clean.

Experience/Venue: Small place, as it's located in a small plaza that is easy to miss. 

Food: Not much options if you're vegan/vegetarian, you can order the sandwiches which are a near identical to California sandwiches. If you've tried Italian sandwiches before, you'll know what to expect. 

From what I can tell you about my friends experience (as meat eaters), they ordered a large pizza and really seemed to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Big fan of their takeout
Typically get the party size pizza and chicken parm dinner but have also eaten in
I like their pizza sauce a lot and I find the crust thin and crispy and it's almost better the second day. 
I also find their sauce doesn't give me heartburn or anything (like some other places) and their prices very fair. 
Just waiting on them to add delivery!"}
{"text":"First time here...bought bruschetta and a thin crust pizza..delicious!! you can taste the freshness. Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out for a while!! Really want to try their pizza, but every time I'm in the area it's late, and these guys close early..

Finally got a chance to try, but didn't get the pizza.. O well, that just means I have to come back again, which is fine with me.. 

Ordered a Veal Sandwich, spicy style.. Ordered  it pretty much plain, only with hot banana peppers..  

I must say that the sandwich was pretty good! The tomato sauce was not too dry and too wet, just perfect! Tasted heavenly!

The veal was just delicious, nice and tender, full of veal flavour!!

The bun was great too, the veal patty fitted perfectly, meaning the meat was just slightly oozing out of the bun.

Next time I'm in the area early enough, I will definitely try their pizza and other items on the menu!

Legit!"}
{"text":"Antonino's Pizzeria is a hidden gem  on Rutherford and Confederation Parkway. The restaurant is small, service is fast and the Pizza delicious.  Always busy at lunch time.  I had a grilled chicken salad which was simple and delicious. They also serve up pasta, veal sandwiches and a friendly smile."}
{"text":"Love, love, love!  Dropped by here one day with my wife when we were in a rush to eat.  Fell in love with the food and have been back numerous times since.

Not much on the outside but great food.  Breaded chicken panini is my favorite!

Also, the service is amazing.  Extremely friendly people!!"}
{"text":"Just had the breaded chicken sandwich with onions and it was pretty good and a huge portion.

Unfortunately they forgot the hot peppers which is my favorite part."}
{"text":"Those who know, know Antonino's. 
It's sort of one of those Italian rights of passages. When you talk about Italian fast food, Antonino's is a gauge on whether or not you know and are willing to drive for good food. Embarrassed that i had never heard of this place, i made my way down one fine afternoon. 

Simple, delicious, cheap, friendly service, you really can't go wrong here - be it a pasta, a fresh Neapolitan pizza or a delicious sandwich. They make it all at a competitive price.

Warning though - group napping is a popular occurrence after an Antonino's meal."}
{"text":"My reviews are either 1 star or 5.  This place gets my 5 star rating!  Small place, good food, decent prices.  Packed pretty much every time I've gone there for lunch, but the owner will make room, some way shape or form.  He's even chased us down in the parking lot telling us there is room.  Now that's service!  The food is made well.  Sandwiches and pizza is on point.  When you order a whole pizza, its worth the wait.  A little secret, order the wings and ask for HOT and HONEY GARLIC mixed.  Its a killer sauce and you'll be there licking your fingers.  Service there is great.  food comes out pretty quickly and their espressos are on point.  Now, if have to wait for a table because my review brings in more people to this location, I won't be happy that I'll have to wait to eat my wings.  Salute!"}
{"text":"Great panzerotti and Bruschetta! Not sure if the waitresses name, but she made the experience great and helped me pick the best toppings for my panzerotti!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Antoniono's since it was a place called Tonino's at Yonge and Elgin Mills that exclusively did take out. And other than location and decor, not much has changed.

The service and quality and undeniable, the atmosphere is friendly and welcoming, and the food always hits the spot. You can't go wrong with a pizza, but I'm an advocate of thin crust and getting it well done."}
{"text":"We heard about this place in a local newspaper in which they wrote about Antonino's winning a nation wide pizza tasting competition, and with reading that I just had to bookmark this place.  Unfortunately for my stomach, we were booked right up and would have to wait to try this local legend of a pizzeria. 

Today was the day of reckoning, we decided to order pizza, and almost forgot about Antonino's, it had been so long since reading the article. 

We called in our order, but found out they don't do delivery. They also told us that they have a special on their party size pizza, we went with that and some pasta. The pasta was $8.95 plus $2.00 for sauce, I don't know if this extra cost was because it was an Alfredo sauce, or if that's the norm. The pizza was $14.99 plus toppings one topping free was the special. 

I walked in to pick up the order, the ambiance was quite nice to sit and eat, and the decor was classic and didn't feel outdated. The service, in person and over the phone was very friendly. I was second in line and three other separate guests just left, and others were seated waiting for their orders for in house or to go. It was a good idea to have called ahead. Just as I received my order, two more parties arrived, one was a big group. To say the least, this place seems to do ok and it made me anticipate my first bite even more so. 

The pizza was great, not too greasy, and the right amount of each topping so no flavour was overpowering. The crust was nice and thin, but didn't get soggy. The pasta was also pretty good, although I'm not a big fan of Alfredo sauce. So I won't hold that against them. The pasta also came with a nice piece of garlic bread, which is always a nice touch. 

Overall a party size pizza with two toppings and an order of pasta came in at $32 and change, which is pretty reasonable. I highly recommend anyone to make the trip, it's worth the reward of award winning pizza. I give it a 4.5 really, No delivery isn't a deal breaker."}
{"text":"I was brought here for lunch by a client and dang, it was good! I had the veal sandwich with cheese. Served on a fresh, soft kaiser bun..yum yum! The veal was cooked perfectly, no chewy strands that you tend to find at lesser joints. The veal wasn't breaded perse, but there was a light crispy dusting of something (likely flour) and it just added to the overall delight of the sandwich. I got it 'sweet' meaning no hot peppers whatsover, and it was perfecto that way. :)
My colleague had a small pizza, and while it may say it serves 1-2, those people better be mighty hungry because you get a massive serving! You can always bring it with you..pizza for lunch, pizza for dinner. Can't complain!

Service was friendly and I like the coziness of this little place. 
I need to come back and try the gnocchis!"}
{"text":"Second visit today and this place does not disappoint! 

First visit had their baked panzo - AH-MAZING! Perfect balance of dough, toppings,  sauce and cheese.

Today, veal panini - I'm so full I can't even think of finishing this review!

It's must try place if you are in the area"}
{"text":"Been a long time fan of their pizza.  Now, I'm a new fan...

Tried the gnocchi rose and chicken parm.  Wow! Awesome!

Definitely remind them about the garlic bread that comes with the dishes.  Dip it in the sauce and enjoy!

This is one of the best gnocchis I've had in a long time!

Chicken parm portion was incredibly generous.  And tasty too.  

Don't hesitate.  Dine in or take out.  

Fully recommend."}
{"text":"Today I finally tried this place for dinner. We ordered a party size pepperoni pizza for takeout. It was done very well, perfect combination of cheese, sauce and pepperoni. I added fresh grated garlic which heightened the whole experience!!! We will definitely be back to try other items!!!"}
{"text":"My family ordered from here before and liked the food so we ordered it tonight and it was my first time trying it. We got a pizza with olives, pineapple, and green peppers as well as a pepperoni. We got home with it and opened the box and tried to pull out a piece and it stuck to the box so we pryed it out with a spatula to then find the drenched bottom of the box. The whole pizza was wet, not with grease, but water or juice of some kind. The pizza cost $17 plus tax so we called and all they would do is give us a $10 credit and did not offer to fix the pizza in any way. I had a piece of the pepperoni? to try it and it tasted greasy and the crust was like paper. 
If you want quality pizza, never go here. I will be warning as many people as I can about this absolute disgrace to pizza."}
{"text":"WOW!  Best Panzerotto.  Their extra sauce to pour on the Panzerotto... was so good.... I just drank it like a shooter from the plastic container.  You can tell this sauce is homemade and delicious!  As I waited, I ordered a beer.  The atmosphere is simple, but the people are friendly.  I will be coming here a lot"}
{"text":"I have never been to the actual restaurant, but my office get pizza from here on Saturdays at work. It's delicious and good price. The toppings also have a wide variety. I really enjoyed it."}
