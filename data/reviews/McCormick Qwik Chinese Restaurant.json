{"text":"My personal favorite is the General Tso's chicken extra spicy but everything I have had from Quik chinese is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Had a couple entrees delivered and I was disappointed. After reading the mix of reviews here I knew what to expect - good chinese food. I wasn't let down. The spicy entrees were spicy, the breading was what east coast chinese offers and the rice was just sticky enough.
Overall we had a good meal and it wasn't pricey. 
We will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"I have dinner from qwik chinese last night. The best chinese food I have in the area. Will be back."}
{"text":"I think I found my new Chinese delivery restaurant! The food isn't 5-stars, but it's still pretty tasty. The prices are good, and they've always been pretty quick with deliveries."}
{"text":"Very good chinese food. Easy to order online. I get the sweet and sour chicken lunch special."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss! You roll the dice each time but I do believe it is better when Gary is at the helm!!! 

Gary once threw in a few potstickers I believe his mom made that were top notch!

I wish they could produce that quality on a consistent basis. I would definitely be there more often."}
{"text":"There is very little meat in anything.  The Kung Pao Chicken hardly had any chicken and the egg roll, which is supposed to have pork had 1 tiny (very tiny) piece of pork in each of two egg rolls.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I knew something was wrong when we went in to eat. Gary has sold Qwik Chinese, the quality of the food we ordered was small, and skimpy, soup was cold, service, there was none. I'll NEVER go back to Qwik Chinese. I used to love that place, never again..."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since the early 90s. The food is consistently delicious and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"We ordered three entrees last night for delivery. All three entrees were extremely dry and my wife could not finish her Pork Lo Mein. The Sesame Chicken was crisp and the flavor was good, but again, was very dry. The Curry Chicken was the best of the three entrees. The white rice was low quality and also dried out. We will not try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Maybe I've had better Chinese in the past than I realized, or perhaps I ordered the wrong things, but I can't see giving this place five stars. The egg rolls were too salty, the hot and sour soup was lacking in sour, the vegetable pork was bland.

It's quick, not over priced and not over cooked. I'm willing to try it again."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for 8 or 10 years and it has always been great. I eat in, take out and get delivery. I just had the cashew chicken lunch special, its a great value. Big portion of great food.
Good service and friendly people too. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best orange chicken ever! You get a huge portion for only ten bucks. I eat a lot and get three meals out of it easily. Such great food at an awesome price, I don't get Chinese anywhere else."}
{"text":"We ordered a large Cashew Chicken and a large Pork Egg Foo Young for lunch.  The Egg Foo Yung had 3 incredibly small patties and had a burnt flavor with the pork served on the side, no bean sprouts or water chestnut but cabbage instead.  Worst Egg Foo Young ever.  The Cashew Chicken was edible ($1 more for white meat) but certainly nothing to get excited about.  Although there was only one other table of customers we never had our drinks refilled and when we mentioned the Egg Foo Young was a tad overcooked our waitress kind of shrugged.  

Maybe we did not order their best specialties or maybe they just had an off day but we will not be back to find out."}
{"text":"BEST Chinese food ever!  Love the people, the homemade food, the qwik special lo mein especially -this place has been in business for many years and is so amazing!"}
{"text":"This used to be a wonderful restaurant. Excellent food, delightful service. Every meal I've had here gets worse and worse. Tonight, the service was spectacular for how horrible it was.  The egg roll had more oil than egg role"}
{"text":"The food is OK, not great. The Mongolian beef is maybe the only great thing they have, everything else is mediocre. I order it because there aren't many other options in my area and I keep hoping they'll do better.

I am especially disappointed in their delivery times. When I order, they quote me 30-45 minutes, AN HOUR LATER (sometimes MORE)  it finally arrives... COLD. This has happened the last two times I ordered from this place. The food is already bland, then to deliver it cold? AND they don't even apologize. 

QWIK Chinese? Ya right. Not even close to \"qwick\"."}
{"text":"Qwik Chinese is awesome! Their food is delicious, the staff is friendly and they prepare take-out orders quickly. The curry vegetable dish is the best!"}
{"text":"I have been on a Chinese food kick lately, and with not a lot of Chinese food in the area, Qwik Chinese is really my only option.  My coworker is in love with this place and has been raving about it for months so I decided to give it a try.  I have been three times now, and while I like some of the dishes, I have been very disappointed with the rest, especially since I think Gary who runs the place is just such a nice guy and I want to keep coming back.

The best thing that I have had here by far is the Shrimp Lo Mein, they don't skimp on the shrimp and the noodles have lots of flavor.  I also have enjoyed the Crab Rangoon a couple of times, they are generous with the filling, but I wish they were folded over like a turnover rather than the fancy flower shape, they would be much easier to eat that way!

My disappointments have come when I venture away from the lo mein.  The sesame chicken was just weird, I had to just throw it away, I was too scared to eat it.  The Mongolian pork was actually pretty tasty, but the ratio of green onions to pork was like 3:1, so I felt like I had been ripped off.  Last time I decided to try the orange beef; the beef was surprisingly tender but it had no flavor, it just tasted like beef, the orange sauce was completely lacking and I was sorely disappointed.

I will probably get food from here again because it is close by and really the only option I have, but I am probably just going to stick to the shrimp lo mein and crab puffs and call it a day."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been looking for a good quality, no MSG using, old fashioned Chinese food restaurant in the Scottsdale area for quite some time. Finally it seems we have found it.  We have eaten here quite a few times and while it is not the fanciest restaurant they do simple Chinese food really well. The owner is almost always there and extremely friendly and the food is tasty.

I have found the Lo Mien and the Mongolian Beef to be outstanding. The garlic chicken and Moo Shu shrimp are favorites as well.

They do deliver but I have almost always found it faster to go in and pick it up.  So, If you are looking for some simple yet very tasty Chinese food, I highly recommend this place. It is nice to have them in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ive been enjoying their food for over one year now. nice staff, fast service, and good food. What more could you want."}
{"text":"Had an upset stomach. Delivery was 30 minutes late. Chicken was over fried. Delivery person was not friendly."}
{"text":"Really wishing I hadn't ordered from here. 
This was my first time trying the food, and it is my last time. I decided to order from Qwik Chinese based off the Google reviews.. 

Ordered Beef LoMein and Potstickers for delivery. 

After 55 minutes, my order was brought to me. Opened up the LoMein and put a scoop on my plate. Tried it, bland but ok I have the potstickers so I'm not complaining. 

The potstickers were wet.. Actually wet. As if they pulled them out of the water, and straight into the container. Extremely soggy and falling apart. I was left with little pieces of pork, not a potsticker. 

Now back to the LoMein,, since I still had the bland noodles, I thought ok I'll eat this, learned my lesson, never order from here again. Nope! 
I went into the container to scoop out more, and there was a piece of metal in the box. 

Taking a closer look, this was definitely not part of the meal, I called the restaurant. 

Their response?, \"There is no metal in the food\" I pleaded saying I just had this delivered, and there is metal. Again \" no metal in food\" then the guy on the phone tried to tell me if there is metal it's from the wok, and that's okay. 

Metal + Food is never OKAY!! 

He didn't apologize or anything, instead he told me it's okay. 

Never order from here. 

Extremely bland, soggy, and disappointing."}
{"text":"Coconut chicken, chicken lo mein, soring rolls, fried rice and won ton soup... All were on point! First time eating here, and will definitely be ordering again! Very good food and great service!"}
{"text":"I had the dumplings, mu shu pork, and orange chicken.  The dumplings and mu shu were tasty and traditional, like I would get back home in NY, but the orange chicken was different.  It was delicious, but the breading was less greasy than usual and gave an aura of home made-ness.  Rather than having been simply plopped in a deep fryer and caked with orange glaze, this seemed to be breaded by hand and almost over fried (but lets not be delusional here).  Partly because of the lack of viable alternatives for good quick chinese restaurants around the area, I'm a fan of Qwik Chinese."}
{"text":"Terrible experience - ordered online, received an email saying our food would be ready in 45 minutes; called after 50 minutes and they said there was a 'technical problem' with the app and no one saw our order, but that they would make if in another 30 minutes.  Will NOT be back or try again. The guy on the phone kept insisting that it wasn't their fault - that is was a problem with the app.    Not impressed and will not be back."}
{"text":"Awesome House Lo Mein Love it. Super fast delivery. From order to front door less than 20 minutes My wife loves the extra spicy Curry Chicken."}
{"text":"Really love the soup and bbq pork slices. We got plenty of food and enjoyed it lots. Lits of fresh veggies!"}
{"text":"I ordered general tso chicken, sesame chicken, white rice, fried rice and 2 eggrolls for delivery. It came within 45 minutes as stated on the the phone and cost $30. I am not sure if sesame chicken is what a recieved (there were no sesame seeds) but it is 90% hard fried breading with some dry, tough stringy \"chicken\" inside. The egg rolls were okay, but again don't taste like what I'm used to. The best thing about my meal was the white rice."}
{"text":"I love this place, it is my favorite Chinese take out delivery restaurant, portions are great, and delivery my hot food."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the area. Great tasting food, good quality, delivery was earlier than estimated time. Tried a number of Chinese delivery in the area and none are nearly as good as Quik. Rarely write reviews, but I'm very pleased!"}
{"text":"I feel like they've improved the quality of the food.  I'm happy with the online ordering feature through, Yelp; however, I think there should be an option to order drinks, say if you want a fountain drink or something."}
{"text":"We just swung by a friends house after they finished moving to this area and they were craving Chinese. 

Me (in my head, not out loud): \"This sounds like the perfect opportunity to use the Yelp app!\" 

Sound effect: Trumpets 

Me (out loud this time): \"Hey guys, I found this Chinese place within walking distance, and Dave N. said it's good, I know that guy!\" 

So off we go with our group of 6. First we get treated with those tasty Chinese crunchy chips. They must have been the Chinese equivalent of the chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant since we got them with our water. 

After looking over the menu, we all wanted to eat everything, which is not possible since this is not a buffet so we go for the family style dinner. Excellent choice. 

First up we get a very tasty soup and egg roll. After mixing and matching some Sriracha sauce with some other sauces on the table, we are ready to go with some main dishes. One thing we made the mistake of is choosing too many dishes with broccoli in it, but other than that, every dish coming out tasted amazing! 

By about dish 3 (mind you, we are sharing with 6 people), we are all really full and can't believe another 2 dishes are coming out. 

Service was amazing, my glass was never empty. At one point, the person I can only assume was the owner (the way his voice seemed to command everyone's attention and how we walked around checking on tables) was trying to full my glass with water while I was drinking it. Pretty funny. 

We all left with takeout boxes, extremely full stomachs and comments about how we will be returning again."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite restaurants in this area! The service is very friendly and fast! How's the quality? Phenomenal! I eat here at least once a week minimum. Lunch and dinner specials are a must have, the perfect place to eat a lot and have leftovers for later"}
{"text":"I ordered for pickup and thought the food was very tasty..

had eggplant and also a beef dish, egg foo young was excellent as well.
haven't tried some of the other dishes but will do so next time!

dumplings were great - high recommend!!"}
{"text":"When the chinese restaurant I was headed for was suddenly closed tonight, I tried this place again after a bad review several years ago.
Hubby had the egg drop soup which had corn in it.  Passable but nothing to write home about.  Had the Walnut shrimp which came with a PILE of mayonnaise \"sauce\" on it.  I wish they hadn't poured it on so heavy.  The shrimp were large enough, lightly floured, and delicious. I wiped the sauce off with napkins and I quickly devoured them.   The walnuts were nicely glazed with honey.    Hubby had orange chicken dish but asked that the chicken not be breaded.  They did that very nicely.  

Here's the rub:  

If you are studying to be a telephone receptionist, this is the place to practice. 
 
Constant ringing of the telephone both the landline and the cell phone.  The problem is that they allow the phones to ring and ring and ring and ring and ring.  There was a symphony of ring tones while we tried to eat.  Not a good thing.  Annoying.  

This place is better than the last time I was here, but not by much."}
{"text":"Over the last three months, I've ordered: Kung Pao Chicken, Mu Shoo Pork, Shrimp in Lobster Sauce, Won Ton Soup, General Tsao's Chicken, Spare Ribs, Egg Foo Yung, Pork Lo Mein, House Fried Rice, Pot Stickers Crab Puffs, Pu Pu Platter and EggRolls. I have yet to hit a clunker.

If you like REALLY hot mustard (Pot Stickers & Egg Rolls demand hot mustard), ask for the \"House Mustard\" not the mustard packets. Yum!!

Being a native New Yorker and learning to like chinese cuisine in NYC's Chinatown and spending my college years eating in Boston's Chinatown, I'd say the food here wouldn't be out of place in either of those settings. My order has always been freshly prepared and hot.

The owner takes pride in his work and takes credit cards. The food is excellent and reasonably priced. They deliver. What more can a bachelor ask for?"}
{"text":"It had been a few years since I last gave this place a try. It hadn't blown me away as I had remembered, but I was still up to giving it another shot.  I must say that this place is much better than I had remembered. I stopped in for lunch and there were several people eating in there at the time. I ordered the Luncheon Special #3 (Cashew Chicken served with an egg roll, fried wonton, fried rice, and a fortune cookie) for myself and a #1 special (Qwik special chicken which also came with all the additional stuff mentioned above) for a friend to go.  Each dish was only $6.25 a piece and were both ready in about 7 minutes. I guess the Qwik part wasn't just a clever name, they actually do cook stuff up pretty fast there.  I brought the food back to the office and tried my lunch. Yes, I also made sure to give my friend his lunch as well.  It was a dark meat chicken, white meat can be substituted, in your typical brown sauce with veggies and cashews. However it was done well. No one ingredient dominated the dish and there wasn't a ton of sauce. The egg roll was crispy and flaky and filled with veggie goodness as well. I like the fact that they will deliver as far south as Camelback, north to Cactus, east to 60th street, and west to 96th. They are open until 9:30 pm seven days a week which is nice as well. I went back to try some of the soups and the dumplings and I have to say that while the soup was good, the dumplings may just be in the top 3 that I have had in Arizona. They don't have that \"just unfrozen\" taste that many restaurants have. I think I would have given them that fifth star had they had both scallion pancakes and noodles w/ sesame sauce on their menu, but alas they do not.  I look forward to going back and trying many of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Cheap and very poorly prepared rice, absolutely disgusting egg drop soup and questionable strips of fried chicken with some type of sauce on it. Never again. I feel like I just threw 13 dollars on the ground and stepped on it. This food is not even suitable for dogs. Whoever is the chef here, please take note of this. I am so sick and tired these SAME chinese restaurants all over town with terrible quality and taste. Uber eats has once again let me down."}
{"text":"Five stars, for a little hole in the wall Chinese joint? Yes, I'm serious. Now, before you Elite's rip me a new one, and call for my Elite badge to be removed...I should say that I was really in the mood for Chinese food. I mean REALLY in the mood for Chinese food. Typically nights like last night, I would've settled for chex mix, beef jerky, fried chicken, doritos or even Taco Bell....catch my drift here?

Ok, so I'm ready for Chinese food. I'm starving. The kind of hunger that could put even third world nations to shame (too insensitive?).

I ordered the almond chicken, egg rolls and brown rice. When I picked it up, the guy that was at the counter was pretty cool. He had one of those voices that made him seem like a character from a 1980's Nintendo game...(Think Piston Honda from Mike Tyson's Punchout). He was pretty cool.

Well, he was cool until, he asked, \"All this food for you?\" Yes. It was all for me. Clearly he couldn't take a hint by my condition. Oh well. He was still really cool. I lied to him BTW. I told him, it was for me and my friend. So he gave me two sets of chopsticks.

The food was amazing. Actually no. It was more like a religious experience. Yes, that freaking amazing. And no, this isn't like five star, white cloth dining. This is the kind of amazing food you eat out of a box, on your favorite couch, watching Archer, South Park, Tosh.0, or Family Guy.

Epic food. I am coming back. I don't care if it's unhealthy. I work out six days a week just for this."}
{"text":"I loved it! It is a great place to stop by for lunch or dinner that's in the area. The food was delicious and was at a low cost for a good amount of servings. I recommend it for lunch if your in a tight schedule. Also the staff was really nice and fast. All in all Qwick Chinese is a great spot to eat at for spectacular, low cost, quick, and a variety to chose from meal in the McCormick area for Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place is so good! They deliver and they take every precision so your food is fresh and hot ..not soggy or cold ever ! Very nice owners and staff"}
{"text":"Do not order from them!!! Took over 2 hours for them to deliver my food!!!! They said it would be an hour at the most!!! The driver called me two different times for my address and cross streets! They gave me a 30% discount and that was it!!! Ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service with attentive and friendly staff. I ended up getting the small order of Sizzling Rice Chicken and an egg roll. Food came out quick and was delicious. Portion size was on point and price was reasonable. Great little Chinese restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Homey place with bad lighting. It adds a little twist to normal American Chinese fare. Different, yet tasty flavors than the average Lo Mein parlor. Well prepared. Not deep fried goop like most strip mall Chinese joints.I would go back again if I'm in the area.

Very friendly staff. Watch out for Karaoke night on Fridays....Very, very loud. However, the pregnant lady DJ sang the most  hauntingly beautiful version of Fleetwood Mac \"Dreams\" which made it alright. Brought me to the brink of tears it was so good."}
{"text":"Great value, and definitely conveniently located. The crab wontons are mostly cream sans flavor as was most my boyfriends food. We'll try them again and see if it was just an off night."}
{"text":"Love me some Qwik Chinese. Gary and his wife are beyond warming. We want to Gary's new location on via Linda because my father in law was in intensive care on 90th street. Gary and his staff were so nice, asking how he was every time we went in there. Coming from the east coast, this is bar none the best Chinese food in AZ."}
{"text":"Our go-to Chinese restaurant close to home in McCormick Ranch. Always pleasantly surprised how yummy the food is. Service is nice and qwik, so glad we found it!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were very hungry while staying at the Scottsdale Resort one night so we decided to use one of my mobile ordering apps and order from Qwik Chinese.  I do have to say they were quick but they did not give us an utensils not even chopsticks.  They also did not provide any rice.  The food was ok but I have definitely had much better."}
{"text":"My first time dining here and the food is exceptionally good. I'm very happy with the quality here plus you get good sized portions for a reasonable price.  I paid 8.95 for chicken curry and it was the bomb and I do mean good. ..I'll be back for sure. .."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. These people forgot to give us rice and utensils. Wtf? We asked for fried rice when we ordered too. Guess I'll eat my beef broccoli with my hands and pretend I have rice."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix from Houston durring Spring Training so we were looking for somewhere that wasn't totally packed. Ran across Quik Chinese. We were a bit skeptical because it's a little hole in the wall in a shopping center and appeared a bit shady. It turned out to be an excellent decision! The wonton soup broth was some of the best I'd had. The General Tsos had great flavor, although it wasn't a \"typical\" General Tsos sauce. The egg rolls tasted like they had a hint of horseradish or wasabi, although the waiter couldn't confirm, that gave it a unique but tasty flavor. Overall, very very good."}
{"text":"Went here based on all the great Yelp reviews.  I almost walked out of this place because it took forever to get my order in.  People kept calling this place, and instead of prioritizing who would get serve first, I guess take out took priority over people who were eating in.  When I finally did get my order in, the food came out fast, but the food was so bland and mediocre, I should have just left then and there, but why would I waste $13?  Anyways, should have tried someplace else.  Also, it was kinda of gross that the owner's daughter was hanging out on the table I was at, and left all here hairs on the plate, the napkins, etc."}
{"text":"We were craving Chinese take-out and randomly found Qwik Chinese because it was close. We were very pleased with the discovery! The food was incredible and tasted much better than the name would imply :) This food is leaps and bounds beyond your typical take out. We got a few small entrees as well as fried rice, it was a ton of delicious food for the price."}
{"text":"I just moved here from NJ, and was looking for something comparable to our old neighborhood chinese place. I believe I found it! The General Tso's is the best! Delivery was prompt and kind. I was also able to pay with a debit card at my door. I think I find my\"go-to\" place."}
{"text":"I'm continually impressed with the quality of the food and I'm a frequent customer for it. Recommend for some solid Chinese food."}
{"text":"This is the only Chinese delivery restaurant we order from. They are EXTREMELY quick (hence the name). I have ordered most of the items from their menu and haven't disliked any of them. I personally love the lo mein."}
{"text":"Met a friend here off of the 4 star yelp rating, thought we'd give it a try.  Sweet and sour chicken was pretty rough, many \"bouncies\" in the chicken as I call it.  Sauce was meager and as hungry as I was I couldn't bring myself to  finish the dish.  Friend ordered shrimp w/lobster sauce, said it was o.k.

Service was great and the people were quite nice.  

Perhaps they have better dishes, and the place is worthy of its 4 star ranking, but I just don't see it."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this establishment since the mid 90's when I worked just around the corner on Via De Ventura.

I have brought co-workers, employees, business partners, friends and family from all over the valley to this place, and nearly every one of them has returned to enjoy what me and my family have enjoyed for several decades.

The fried pot stickers are a delightful change from what all the other restaurants are doing, and they are wonderfully delicious.

The Qwik Special Chinese and the Chicken Chow Mein are scrumptious. And the Mongolian Beef is spiced just right.

Gary, the owner, is a wonderful host. 

This is a long drive for me, but it is definitely worth it.

You will not be disappointed. Even the people who don't normally like Chinese food have since returned to enjoy this establishment."}
{"text":"The delivery was quick and the deliver very polite. I was impressed with the quality you get for the price they offer. I will definitely be ordering from here."}
{"text":"Its nice to support the locals vs the big chains, however some times its a trade off. 

It was nice to get free won ton chips at the table.  The upgrade to brown rice is a bit steep however at $1.

The dishes them self were decent but nothing too impressible and when you ask for hot sauce you get a small dish of chilli oil, hardly enough for a true fire head. 

If you are in the area give it a try, but don't drive too far you will be just as happy or happier at a peiwei for about the same price."}
{"text":"I live with the pickiest eater on the face of the Earth. This place is on the list of 4 pre-approved restaurant suggestions that she gets excited about. Gary, the owner, is great. Not only does he make a mean Crab Puff, but when the World's Pickiest Eater ('cause that's what I call her in real life) left the lights on in her car and drained the battery, Gary saved the day with a rescue mission involving jumper cables. 

As for the food, we always get the Crab Puffs, Broccoli Chicken, and Orange Chicken. It's all consistently great. Sometimes, when we're feeling crazy, we order different stuff and it's always good too. Qwik Chinese is a solid choice anyway you go."}
{"text":"My wife always says, \"I don't trust Yelp.\" So when we decided to eat Chinese on Christmas, she was skeptical when I chose this place because it had the highest rating in our vicinity. Unfortunately, my wife was right.  The fact that Yelpers gave this place 4 and 5 stars kind of calls the whole medium into question. 

The place is in an out of the way strip mall, which is fine. I like getting off the beaten path.  It was also relatively full, which I took as a good sign. Upon entering, the decor is pretty mediocre, not too much Chinese character. But there are televisions EVERYWHERE. And they're all on different channels! Just looking up from your food could give you schizophrenia. 

But at that point, we didn't have any food. And we wouldn't for a long time, because no one came to take our order for 20 minutes. Employees/family members stood around, argued with one another and wandered about aimlessly, but no one helped us. Finally, my wife got up and walked to the hostess desk. The guy there apologized, said he didn't really work there, but took our order anyway. 

As we sat and wondered why someone that didn't work at the restaurant took our order, a waitress that actually worked there lectured the table next to us about how they didn't order properly, thus the delay in the arrival of their meal.

I turned to my wife and said, \"Wow, they're having issues,\" at which point the father of the family in the booth next to us turned around and said, \"You have no idea. You're going to be here awhile.\"

My wife used to work in restaurants and has a degree in hotel and restaurant management, so we spent the rest of our time trying to figure out exactly what the hell was going on. We concluded that nobody in the restaurant had actually ever worked in a restaurant before. Maybe they had eaten at one a few times. I also watched Chinese tv with my left eye and an NBA game with my right eye.

Eventually, our egg drop soup, hot and sour soup, crispy duck and cashew chicken came. It was mediocre.

So, Yelpers, please be honest with your reviews. And can we please get a decent Chinese restaurant in Phoenix?"}
{"text":"I go here every time I can't figure out where I want to eat because let's be real, you can't go wrong with Chinese food! My favourite thing to get here is the Chef's Special Singapore Rice Noodles. This is such a flavorful dish and can also serve as great drunk food on Sundays post bottomless mimosas. 

Their egg rolls are always a good addition to any meal! The service is \"qwik\" and the staff is very friendly. I usually try their vegetarian options ( you can also add fried tofu to most dishes) but my friend tried their kung pao chicken and loved it."}
{"text":"I used Eat24 to order pickup here. Food was decent. Not the best Chinese I've had, but I would go again and try something different. I got the chicken fried rice."}
{"text":"Decent food. Fast delivery. Nothing out of the ordinary. The chicken seemed dry and kind of fatty."}
{"text":"I mean I try not to know my Chinese delivery place too intimately but I can definitely say this place rocks. I order like once a week and it's always great. The delivery takes a little long but I love like 15 mins away. The online ordering helps my sloth level to stay low when I'm getting work, it's fantastic."}
{"text":"So happy with orange chicken, and the Free check in off egg roll?I will try some different next time."}
{"text":"If I could come here for fried rice every day... I would. I've been in a few times to eat and to take out (phone orders and in person) and the staff is always courteous and helpful. Food comes out hot and fast (hence the name quick chinese). 
I haven't had a whole lot on their menu yet but the priced are great and the portions are big. Aside from the good food, it's nice to be greeted with a warm welcome and even recognized after only being in a few times."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not good either. I requested a lunch portion of the Orange Chicken, it is not on the menu so it is a dollar more. I did not get anything like I would consider orange chicken. It was okay tasting and a little on the cold side. I will not be back. Guess I should have known when it was empty at lunch time."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this Chinese restaurant, The staff is very friendly & kind, The restaurant is always providing  daily specials, also the fried rice was a real treat,,  the egg foo young was made to perfection,


Eric & Jay is awesome ,"}
{"text":"You know when you get a craving for that old school American style Chinese food.. the kind thats a little greasy but tasty and comforting.. well this is the place! Incidentally next door to LA Fitness the place generally crawls with muscleicious guys for their post work out meal.. tonight of course was no exception.. I digress..

They make all the usual suspects, sweet and sours, moo shu's, fried crispy bits and such. I really dig the thick muscle.. I mean, Chippie's Family Style Tofu.. lightly fried tofu with loads of veggies in a brown sauce, yummy! Be sure to ask him to make it spicy!! The Hot and Spicy Cabbage Salad is also yummy and refreshing. 

We all have these neighborhood Chinese places, usually family owned.. not great, not sucky but just what the craving called for."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this little \"Ma & Pa\" place. The place is dirty. If the wall paper is dirty and the windows are dirty, then not so confident about the kitchen. My order was brought out to me with fried rice instead of steamed. However the waiter noticed it on his own and corrected it promptly. The won tons were a little stale. I liked the egg drop soup. I had Kung Pao Chicken. The sauce was good and the vegetables were cooked well. But the chicken was low-quality. Spring roll was average. The Rangoon was too much batter, a little stale, & only cream cheese, with no detectable seasoning. Prices were very reasonable and with the Restaurant.com certificate, the cost for three lunch specials and tip was just over $20. Service was fast."}
{"text":"I love this place! The owner is always there and you can tell he takes great pride in what he does. Great food and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Meh, is right. My Friday night Netflix & chill was ruined. 

Doorbell rings about 45-50 minutes after I placed my order. I open the door and get a nice gust of cigarette smoke in my face. Lovely. The guy handed me my bag and told me to have a nice night. 

Open bag and my Szechwan beef is really chicken, of course I was charged for the beef. Skimpy on the fried rice serving. 

The second entrée was missing the rice. What good is Chinese food without rice? It's not.  

I did email grubhub and get a $2 refund for the missing items. Whoop."}
{"text":"My neighborhood Chinese restaurant.  Ordered my old standby egg foo young.  Not sure where they put the egg. These were definitely premade patties.  Not sure what the main ingredient was. Lots of OK gravy and good white rice.  No need to go back regardless of how close."}
{"text":"We used to come here frequently for years. But since Gary is not there anymore, the quality of the food is getting worse and worse. I called the same dish any time I went there. Sometimes it was good, sometimes it was bad, and sometimes it was pretty disappointinng. The quality of the plate depends on what they have in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! We ordered delivery, which i prepaid with my credit card. However, the driver told my daughters that the order wasn't paid for so they gave him $18. I called the restaurant and asked why the driver took all that money when the order was prepaid. Well apparently the driver thought it was his \"tip\". Then why did he tell my daughter the order WASN'T paid for? The driver went back to our house and gave back the $18 after my insistence.  Plus, the chicken with the chicken teriyaki was not chicken! It was brown and disgusting looking. My daughter couldn't eat it. I will NEVER order from here again."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my work. I dont normally go out for Chinese because of bad experiences. This last time though I was just craving some Sweet and Sour Chicken!

I yelped for a location nearby, found this. Headed over and to my surprise they have smoking lunch deals! They range from $6.99 to $8.99 I believe and have your typical go to dishes. 

Like I said, I opted for the Sweet and Sour Chicken. The portion was pretty dang big! I didnt get to finish nearly everything. It came with fried rice and a Crab Rangoon. The sauce was a little salty, or maybe it was the breading. Overall I was very happy with my $7.99 lunch decision. It definitely fulfilled my craving!

Id come back for sure and next time Ill try the Sesame Chicken!"}
{"text":"And we're BACK! 

Spicy eggplant, add chicken, steamed rice...OMFG. I may put this on my short list for foods to be brought to me in my padded cell on 'you can have WHATEVER you want' day at the sanitarium. 

Again with the eggroll...5 stars baby. Crispy, fresh, delicious...nom nom nom.

The eggplant was well cooked, flavorful and the accompanying spicy sauce, although not THAT spicy, had a nice little kick to it and you know you can always add more sriracha sauce if you want a little more heat. Plus, they delivered it to my job (which is almost enough to push them up to 4 1/2!) especially on a crazy day like today. (Oh hell, who am I kidding, every day is crazy)."}
{"text":"Too hung over to venture out for food. Found this place that delivered to my hotel room. I ordered the chicken/broccoli, sweet n sour pork, chicken fried rice and a chicken egg roll. The service was super fast, friendly. The food is very good and it's a lot for one person. It all tasted freshly made. Very happy and mmm the perfect hang over food Hahahahah. Check this place out! Excellent food!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is probably the worst Chinese food I've had. We ordered: 
-chicken chow mein(no flavor whatsoever, we drenched it in soy sauce)
-fried dumplings (breading was extremely chewy and stuck to our teeth)
-orange chicken (I enjoyed the sauce but the meat inside was extremely tough)
-and shrimp fried rice (shrimp over cooked with no flavor- looked like they just threes shrimp into a batch of friend rice that was already cooked). 

To top it all off, I found a nice big black hair in my food. 

Overall Pros: enjoyable orange chicken sauce 
Cons: food was over cooked and not flavored, hair in food"}
{"text":"The main guy/GM that is there at night is awesome.  Very friendly and he remembers everyone's name.  I tried this place 3 times hoping to have a better experience with the food, but my review is poor b/c the quality of the food is poor.  The grease they use must be gnarly b/c it was no bueno for my stomach almost immediately.  I tried to like it, but I can't eat chinese here again, which stinks b/c it's right across the street from my house. I eat chinese regularly, so it's not like I'm not used to grease."}
{"text":"Very friendly owners (family owned), very small place, great food! Try the beef Mongolian and creamcheese rangoons. They are amazing. Place is hidden, location could be better. But if you have a problem with that then Gary opened another location off 90th St. and Via Linda in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Kung pao chicken had no spice whatsoever. And had way too much zucchini in it and no peanuts. The crab puffs were a joke. As an update to this....the food tore my stomach apart and I got sick from it."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 3 years ... why? It's the best Chinese Food around! 
Really friendly owners and employees and their food is always delish. I'm from the PNW and Chinese food is always good.. down here I have had issues with other places and always come back to this one! Only problem is I wished they delivered to my area. Great food, great price ! :) YUM"}
{"text":"When Gary owned this restaurant, the food was delicious. But unfortunately, it just isn't good at all anymore, and I'm not picky about food! I've tried several dishes and they were bland, with hardly any meat and/or too salty. The lemon chicken was prepared like sweet and sour chicken, with very small pieces inside the fried batter. They didn't even know what Chow Mein was, and gave us Lo Mein instead, which had short noodles and not much seasoning. The hot and spicy cabbage salad had pieces of chicken in it (which it didn't before) and it was salty and covered with soy sauce. You'd be better off driving a few miles to the Qwik Chinese Bistro and get excellent food with Gary."}
{"text":"The food is great here!!! And as if that weren't enough the owner is the nicest guy in the world!!!! Pork lo mein is very good. The crab puffs and the pot stickers!! Plus they deliver!!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but don't order delivery.  Our order arrived in 30 minutes.  We tipped $9 on a $45 order.  The driver forgot part of our order.  It took an additional 55 minutes to get the remainder of our order.

I've never had less than 5-star service when dining in, but I'll order somewhere else next time I want delivery."}
{"text":"My wife and I had some banking to do nearby, saw this place, crossed our fingers and gave it a shot for lunch. My favorite type of discovery. An independent, local place that offers nice value and good honest food. Clean, tiny and not fancy, its a throwback that feels like a coffee shop crossed with a Chinese joint from 1975. $6.50 lunch specials that included great soup, and egg roll and tasty, traditional entrees on my grandmother's plates. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The food here is great.  Best Chinese I've found in AZ and not super pricey.  Gary, the owner, is always here and always cheerful, friendly, and always remembers us and our orders, even when we haven't  been in for a year!  Needless to say, this place is awesome and you need to come here!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place a lot, and was a very frequent customer.  I have become increasingly irritated with their mistakes, however, and now will not return.  They don't pack the food up properly so every time there is a huge mess to clean up with sauce everywhere.  It gets all over everything because it is not packaged in a way that prevents leakage. They frequently forget to include sauces or make mistakes by sending the incorrect item(s).  My most recent order was very different from the menu descriptions and when I called thinking they would want to bring me different dishes to make it right, they were very unaccomodating (even the owner).  They have lost a regular customer due to their poor customer service and lack of accurate menu descriptions.  Also, I am always shorted on rice. If I order two dishes, I expect to get two rice containers, not just one.  This is always frustrating, and even when I have asked for extra rice, they don't seem to include it. Isn't rice cheap?  I don't know why they are so stingy with it."}
{"text":"This is my second trip here. Came for lunch because I came a month or so ago for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. I'm even more surprised with the lunch. For $8 I got a lunch special that was chicken chow mein that comes with soup, egg roll, and fried rice. To top it all off, the food (with exception of the fried rice which is hit or miss) was all amazing!"}
{"text":"I had Qwik Chinese delivered, and it was excellent.  I enjoyed everything I got, especially the huge eggrolls!"}
{"text":"I just placed my first order with this restaurant through Grubhub. I ordered the cashew chicken, chicken fried rice, and a can of Pepsi. With a $3 tip, the total came to $24.70. Pretty ridiculous, but I guess you pay for convenience. The food came in a timely manner. However, the food was not good. The worst was the chicken fried rice. The odor was unbearable and the chicken looked inedible. I didn't even want to feed it to my dog. I'm pissed that $25 went down the drain and I would advise anyone to stay clear of this place. Yuck!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow~Awesome! Their service is pretty nice! And the main point is that I love the food in here! I will be there again:)"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome owner. Had the Kun Pao and Orange Chicken,  both were a huge upgrade from the usual Panda Express. Expect me to be back at Qwik Chinese sometime soon!"}
{"text":"O my worst Chinese I have ever had-chicken was like rubber all dark meat with no sauce....I was stupid enough to try the UrberEats app with the $5 bowls......my Beagle even turned his nose up at eating it!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Qwik Chinese for over 12 years, before Gary was the owner. We have never had a problem with the food or service until recently. Ever since Gary went to the new location, this place has gone way down hill and I will no longer recommend this place to anyone, not even my worst enemy. The people answering the phones don't know the menu and options not listed on the menu. No one there has any customer service skills, and every time I've gone in since Gary left, I have been highly unsatisfied and have experienced a problem with my food EVERY single time. 

If you are thinking of eating here, think twice! Go to the new location at Via Linda and 90th street. I haven't been there yet, but it HAS to be better than this original location!"}
{"text":"I had a certificate to this place so we tried it out yesterday. It was pretty standard Chinese food, but nothing to rave about. We ordered two lunch specials: sweet and sour shrimp and shrimp with vegetables. It was nice to learn that their egg rolls and soups during lunch contain no meat. Our server was nice and answered our questions well. My sweet and sour shrimp had breading on it and it was a bit thick, the spring rolls were pretty good and the egg soup was okay. My friends dish had some interesting sauce on it, which I didn't particularly like. I had to order almond cookies to make my total $20 and I tried one when I got home, and I didn't like it. Intimate, good service but the food wasn't so great that I'd come back."}
{"text":"We ordered lunch delivery through Yelp for our office.  I'd say the portions are small for the money.  They forgot items in the order and they were late because the driver got lost.   Address, suite number and office name were all provided.  They didn't call for help so when we called looking for the order they told us the driver was lost.  Maybe they were simply late??  We aren't sure.  The food was mediocre.    Probably won't order again."}
{"text":"I ordered the house special fried rice, fried shrimp, and chicken fried rice. Wow, I'm very impressed. All of the food especially the house fried rice was soooooo yummy!! Our food arrived 10 minutes earlier than we expected it and it was super fresh and hot. The delivery guy was very polite and kind. I'm looking forward to the next movie and Chinese food at home night. Yum!"}
{"text":"Man. This food was absolutely delicious. We got delivery and when food is delivered, I feel like it's never as great as it is when you dine in and that was not the case. Food was amazing. Got a couple entrees, egg rolls and got and sour soup. 110% satisfied and will be a returning customer."}
{"text":"I grew up in the Bay Area in California, so I know good Chinese food when I taste it. This is the best Chinese food that I found in the seven years I lived in Phoenix.
The flavor is fantastic, the prices are reasonable and the service is something of years gone bye.
If you are looking for an upscale dining experience, this place is not for you. The atmosphere is casual and laid back. So throw on your shorts and flip-flops and head to a great restaurant for a great dinner.
(I also hear they deliver but I always lived outside of their delivery area. My wife and I would drive over twenty minutes each way just to eat dinner here.)"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Chinese food places in Scottsdale.  Highly recommended. The staff here is AWESOME and I love coming here"}
{"text":"Well here goes.. I REALLY wanted to like this place. I honestly HATE leaving one- star reviews. I think it is just plain mean. But I have to for this restaurant, their food is plain disgusting and an embarrassment to the whole state of Arizona. 

I ordered take out this second time (had to give it one more chance) and ordered kung pao chicken with shrimp(there were only 3 shrimp). The chicken was DISGUSTING! It is slimy and stringy and just NASTY. I can't believe they serve this. The shrimp was the only decent thing in the box even though there were just three. I honestly can't tell you with words how disappointed I am that people would serve this food. Please do yourself a favor and don't go to this place. EVER.  Go to New China Gate down the road and you'll save yourself time patience and hunger. No they did not pay me to say that I am just a huge fan of good Chinese food and McCormick needs to redo their restaurant or throw in the towel. 

Gross gross gross!"}
{"text":"We really love this place!  It is our go-to for Chinese delivery and we always get consistently good food, with plenty of leftovers to go around.  The potstickers and combo friend rice are our staples, and you can't go wrong with the Kung pao chicken.  We've never been disappointed and always look forward to receiving a meal from here!"}
{"text":"I was happy with the ginger chicken!  They were very friendly and quick.  My diet coke was flat though so I got tea instead."}
{"text":"It's ok. The take-out breaded chicken was crammed in a tight box so the breading got steamed to be chewy instead of being crispy. I think the food tastes better dine-in than takeout. They have good lunch specials. Friendly people."}
{"text":"I had been eyeing this place for a while since I moved to this side and would come to the Vig. I ended up ordering through postmates last week I got orange chicken and a vegetable and chicken entree both were decent but nothing amazing. I probably would order again but it wouldn't go on my favorites list."}
{"text":"So impressed!!! Super quick delivery - was quoted 30-45 and it was there in 10 mins!! Unbelievable! They also had a mobile payment device so we could swipe our card right at our door! The food is incredible! My husband got pork fried rice which he loved!! I ordered sweet and sour chicken - so yummy and I had enough for left overs! Trust me, whatever the issues in the past were they are long gone... The best Chinese I've had here!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Chinese place around here. My boyfriend is Gluten free, and they have no problem switching some of the recipes to accommodate (shoutout to the garlic chicken and the ginger chicken!). 

My personal favorite dish is the steamed dumplings. The sauce that comes with it is incredible. Straight up save the left over and throw it on the rice."}
{"text":"First & last time here. I ordered the garlic chicken... Never in my life have I said something has had \"too much\" garlic before. Until now. The name should be garlic with some vegetables and 4 bites of chicken. The general sao on the other hand is ok. Has a nice little spice to it. 
Ordered online and they quoted us an hour. I drove 5 minutes to pick it up...."}
{"text":"Oh man! this food is so scrumptious mmm the first time we had it we got it to go and oh man i believe it was the Chow lo mein that had just the right texture with the noodles, not too soft and not dry ....mmm great flavor too  ...by far you can not beat their lunch special mmm you get egg drop soup, a heaping meal, and a desert too i believe for a great price    
   Great service too! you can tell they are really pleased to have you as a customer :D ...i will be back"}
{"text":"Good qwik Chinese the best I have found for delivery in the Scottsdale area the lo mein is great!"}
{"text":"Consistently quality, delicious Chinese!  A customer for 20 years and never a bad meal.  Love Qwik Chinese!"}
{"text":"The most incredible customer service! I accidentally ordered from the McCormick location and went to pick up at the Via Linda location. They immediately called the other location, and they delivered it to the Via Linda at no additional cost. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite neighborhood spot.  We love the potstickers. We love the vía linda location for dine in and use the McCormick location for takeout."}
{"text":"qwik chinese is my favorite chinses food in scottsdale, love the orange chicken. qwik chinese never dispointed  me. highly recommend guys."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite restaurant after I moved to paradise. Prices are fair, foods are pretty sizable, and the driver was very friendly and nice. Highly recommended Mongolian Beef, and Beef chow fen. The only thing to complain about This place is their Mongolian Beef not SPICY enough even though I told them to ADD MORE SPICY ob the phone."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good Chinese place in Scottsdale since I moved here and this place is really good! The restaurant is very nice inside and my order was hot and ready for pickup when I arrived.  I got the steamed dumplings and the sweet and sour chicken - it was so good! The batter on the chicken was perfectly crispy and the dumplings were absolutely perfect; they melted inside my mouth - it was amazing. I got some fried rice which was very tasty as well.

Only reason I knocked a star off was because we ordered egg rolls and they were kind of a disappointment. They tasted like the frozen ones you get at the grocery store. But the rest of the food was amazing so I definitely suggest checking this place out! I will be back again for sure to try new things on the menu."}
{"text":"We were out of town visitors and had a craving for Chinese! We had some hotel neighbors who had food from this place and it smelled so GOOD!! So we went and unintentionally ordered enough food for an army. No regrets! Also, the service here is remarkable!! Totally wish we had this place in SD!"}
{"text":"When looking for Chinese delivery, this was one of two restaurants that popped up in my app.  I had tried the other restaurant in the past and wasn't overly impressed so decided to try Qwik Chinese.  And I am so glad I did.  The food was amazing, it was super hot when it was delivered, and delivery was quick!  They even arrived 15 minutes earlier than the app estimated.  Our favorites were the egg fried rice, orange chicken, and chicken lo mein.  I will definitely order from Qwik the next time we want Chinese delivery.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Dine in order: chicken lo mein was favorite, Mongolian beef a really good also. Sesame chicken had good flavor but breading a bit thick. Shrimp with lobster sauce was barely ok. All a lunch special with egg drop soup, cream puff and egg roll. Those 3 items made the meal better than average.  Didn't have any boba milk tea..."}
{"text":"Yelp brought me here, as always!  I didn't exactly know what to expect of a place that calls itself Qwik (Chinese) - doesn't really lend itself to delicious, quality, or any other adjective that is the opposite of fast food.  

That having been said, the food was good!  I had some wonton soup and the almond chicken delivered.  The soup was flavorful enough, though there was probably more soup than ingredients.  The wontons themselves don't have the super thin kind of consistency, more of a thicker, chewy, doughy kind of texture.  I prefer the former which is why I brought this up.  Still good though.  The chicken dish itself was pretty good as well, using quality chicken (not that questionable, \"is this rubber thing I'm chewing actually chicken?\" taste).  Flavorful as well, and doesn't leave you with that greasy, grimy, stuck in the bottom of your stomach kind of feeling like most other chinese does.  

To sum it up I'd say this place has the intent of a more traditional/home cooked kind of chinese meal, but it's been tailored a bit for stateside consumption.  Won't stop me from going back though!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery tonight. We were pleasantly surprised. Our food arrived within 35 mins and everything was great. So happy to have finally found a good Chinese restaurant that delivers. 

We ordered sizzling rice soup, crab wontons, egg rolls, chicken and vegetables, mu shu pork, Kung pao chicken, crispy beef and vegetable fried rice. Everything was fresh and warm. You know it's good when even the baby is shoveling it in! 

They sent a ton of extra sauces like soy, spicy mustard etc. Everything was spot on. We will be ordering from them again soon."}
{"text":"This is our go to chinese place. I have never dined in, but always carry out. They may deliver but I am not sure as I've never asked. The food is like chinese back east. They have great wonton soup, the best eggrolls I've found in Arizona and very friendly service. Call ahead and your food is ready for pickup within 15 minutes, and always steaming hot. My only complaint is that the only spicy mustard they have comes in packets and isn't that good. If they could get real spicy mustard the egg rolls would be even better. Also, get the pot stickers or crab rangoons. Amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually big on chinese, but this place is doing it right! Nice clean feel upon entering, and I was promptly greeted by a friendly man whom I would guess is the owner.  The menu was easy to read, and the prices are fair. I ordered won ton soup and moo goo gai pan.  Both were great!  Would definitely recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese Food that I had in Arizona......highly recommend ?Very good service?I love this place?will come back......"}
{"text":"The chicken Lo mein was great. The owner, Gary, noticed my name when I paid and greeted me by my name when I left. This place has a very wholesome vibe and great Chinese food."}
{"text":"Friday around 11-12, not too crowded, clean tables and really nice staff. The space isn't huge but that's what I liked about it. They were attentive and provided refills and checked on our table. 

Awesome lunch deals! Each of their lunch specials come with fried rice, an egg roll, crab puff and egg drop soup. I went for the sesame chicken and we also had beef and broccoli at my table. The soup was good and definitely better than most egg drop soups I've had at other places. The egg roll and crab puff were hot and crispy, and the fried rice was good as well. Sesame chicken came out hot and with lots of sauce, it was tasty. The beef and broccoli were also on point. 

Overall I think it's a great deal for the price. I left full and content and enjoyed the meal. I'll definitely be back when I get a craving and try other options on the lunch menu! Compared to other similar places I've been in the area, I'd come here first."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I tried this place for lunch and were all very happy and satisfied. The service was very good, food arrived quickly, and it was delicious. I ordered the Mongolian beef at the suggestion of the owner taking our order, and it was very good. Egg role was very light and flakey, fresh. Everything with veggies was incredibly fresh. We are planning on going back to this place often."}
{"text":"Not good. Just not good. I ordered sesame chicken was was mostly breading with tiny bits of chicken hidden somewhere inside the thick crust of breading. The sesame sauce was a thin liquid syrup the pooled all to the bottom instead of coating the chicken. The sauce was also so sweet it made the already subpar dish inedible. I also ordered walnut shrimp which were undercooked and the sauce was placed in blobs sporadically around the dish instead of being tossed and evenly coated. The ice tea had no ice cubes and was room temperature. There was so much wrong with this \"meal\", it leaves me feeling like they don't even care about what they're serving to customers. I ended up throwing the majority of my dinner in the trash. I can't speak about their customer service because I ordered delivery. Waste of money, I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"So we are staying at a local resort and called for a delivery. Of course they knew they were delivering to a resort maybe some plates or napkins at the very least some plastic forks ect. would have been nice. Now let's move on to the food TERRIBLE!!! No sweet and sour sauce for dipping for the egg rolls or sweet and sour chicken that was ordered. Seen on here biggest egg rolls around, panda has bigger then this crap. Pork fried rice bland. Even my 9 year old says why is there hardly any filling in the egg roll and she never complains about anything. Portions from Chinese food places are for the most part generous well not at this place. And the prices for the quality and portions is a joke. Could continue with more but think you get the picture. Don't waste your money on this place!"}
{"text":"This little hide away resturant is delicious, been there twice and wasnt disapointed. Service is great, food is awesome, our new found chinese secret."}
{"text":"Food was so heavily salted from the bbq ribs that were huge and looked great, but were smoked and super salty. Even the egg rolls were salty...How do you over salt egg rolls? Everything had a strange taste to it from rice to vegetables. We both decided this was not Chinese food at all, both from east coast and grew up eating great Chinese food, this was not it. Very disappointed...at least it was warm and looked good?"}
{"text":"I have been a customer for years.  it has the BEST house special fried rice i ever had.  Moo Shu Pork to die for.  I was sad to see negative views.  Owner is a very nice person and they really treat their customers well.  Love both restaurants."}
{"text":"The place is small family owned the servers are friendly. The service is quick and at lunch that is one of my priorities. Each item is made fresh and is always steaming when arriving to our table. Working my way down then lunch menu so far no complaints only satisfaction."}
{"text":"This place is the new Chop & Wok.  Good old fashioned, down and dirty chinese take out.  The owner is right out of a Seinfeld episode and it's worth eating there just to watch him run the show."}
{"text":"Don't get me started on how much I love this place and its owner, Gary. Best Chinese in Scottsdale (Hsubaloo and Segrio can corroborate these claims).

I order 1 thing, and one thing only: General Tao's Chicken. Extra extra extra extra spicy, extra chicken (only $1 more). It is to die for. Great big chunks of chicken, tossed in a deliciously sweet sauce that is littered with chili peppers. Top notch quality. (under $10 and change with tax)

I have also had the pot stickers here. Apparently steamed and then grilled to put some heavenly char-flavoring on them.  (a little expensive at $7.95 plus tax, but oh so good.)

Gary, the owner, is the best.. always friendly."}
