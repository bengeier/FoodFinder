{"text":"We held a Mom's Night Out with about 120 women in the ballroom and it could not have been more perfect! The food and beverage staff were very helpful and the set up and sound system were all in perfect order!
The most impressive element of the Venue is the decor. The attention to detail added the perfect touch to our evening!

We will definitely have another event here again!"}
{"text":"I had my wedding event at The Venue last month and couldn't ask for a more perfect place or staff!  It was truly a pleasure to work with everyone there!  Through the whole process they were pleasant, professional and quick to respond in all e-mail/phone communications and meetings.  

They can help you with almost every aspect of your wedding or event, from catering to coordinating, marketing, and even sound and lighting.  

The Venue itself has so much charm and beauty on its own that I didn't need to bring in a lot of extra decor to dress it up.  Plus, when they opened the retractable roof, it gave the  feeling of being outdoors and provided awesome natural lighting for my photos and videos.  

The location is great too! Plenty of parking nearby and it is within walking distance of many fabulous boutiques and restaurants in Old Town.  There is even an array of accommodations for your guests nearby and some within walking distance."}
{"text":"Beautiful space; terrible to work with, all based around poor communication. Ended up over-charged and felt like it was a big headache. For example, while our event was always contracted for a certain number of guests, found out 5 days before our event that they wanted to charge us $700 for chairs that they didn't have. Ended up NOT charging us for chairs after arguing with them. Also, building was not ADA accessible (for people in wheelchairs) but did not inform us of this - found out at our event that their elevator could not be used."}
{"text":"As a wedding and event planner in the industry, who has worked at every major venue and resort in the Valley, I couldn't be more pleased with The Venue Scottsdale. Not only is it gorgeous with all the new renovations and changes, but they truly have created a dream staffing team to work with and they make our client's job as well as our job as planners complete breeze. 

As a wedding planner, we pay very close attention to all the details, it is in our hands to make our client's day the most seamless day possible so our Bride's don't stress or think that something isn't getting executed the way they hoped. Not only is The Venue Scottsdale hands on making sure everything is executed for the Venue itself, but they extend a hand to help with our clients throughout their event as well. 

We had the privilege of organizing Scottsdale's biggest bridal event together and there truly wasn't a better location to choose, but The Venue Scottsdale. The new retractable roof made the event extra special for all it's patrons, the sound and lighting provided by the venue was on point, and we heard absolutely nothing but positive comments about the venue itself as the patrons were leaving at the end of the event. 

We look forward to hosting more events here, as well as bringing out clients!! I can't say enough about our experiences at The Venue Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We went here for an Oktoberfest today after having purchased a coupon deal for admission and beverages (4 beers per person).  The place was easy to locate in Old Town Scottsdale, and on-street parking was readily available nearby.

Pros:

Surprisingly, this was an indoor venue instead of outdoor, and it seemed more like a large beer hall with lots of old world decor, which took some of the disappointment out of being confined indoors on such a beautiful day.

Staff were generally pretty friendly and helpful, seating was plentiful, the oompa band (3 local musicians) was entertaining and fun, and the craft beer (especially the Oktoberfest Lager) was very nice.

Cons:

In spite of having a printed (and web published) schedule of activities, the stage crew & management seemed genuinely confused as to the order of things.  When the band went on break, the sound team played loud rock music from some radio station over the PA system, rather then anything remotely themed to the event.

Food offerings were meager (brats $7, soft pretzels $4, small bags of potato chips, etc).  The brats were served in a sliced, hard baguette with choice of grilled onions and/or sauerkraut, but were dry and somewhat flavorless.  In addition, there was only regular, yellow mustard available at the counter.  No spicy or German style mustard was available, but one of the staff did manage to scrounge up a small bowl of Dijon after I asked.  No other accompaniments were available, such as potato salad or fries, nor were there any desserts on offer.

Overall, I'd rate this event at about a \"2\", mainly because of the disorganization and poor quality of food offerings."}
{"text":"I think this is a decent venue, unfortunately the times I was there, there was no food and the concerts were very long. It would have been nice if they offered a little something extra besides drinks, but a lot of places don't."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best for concerts. Long, rectangular space that is absolutely flat. If you are not fairly close to the stage you can't see the stage. Weird layout..."}
{"text":"For those people giving it 4-5 stars - have you been to another concert?...like a professionally coordinated, big boy event?  What are you comparing it against?

This place is a train wreck.  I saw Foster the People, a sold out show.  The doors opened at 7PM so I showed up around 9PM.  Despite arriving a whole 2 hours after the doors opened, I still waited 15 min in line to get into the place.

The acoustics are awful and if you're not within 50 feet of the stage, you're not going to see the act.

I wouldn't come back here if Foster the People were giving out free hand jobs."}
{"text":"The Venue of Scottsdale would be the product  if Sharon Osbourne had sex with The Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I attended an event a few weeks ago and never got around to review this venue. Well first off, it was hot. For the 25 dollars I spent, you think they could buy some fans or better yet, turn on the A/C. The bartenders I had service from weren't very friendly, and didn't deserve the tip I gave them. I liked the general feel of the venue interesting layout. 

Since it was so hot in the venue, my friend actually got sick from it. She was the DD, so she had nothing to drink that night and security wanted to throw her and my friend (who was trying to help her) out of the event for being sick. 

Well shit. Maybe if they had more fans things like this wouldn't happen.

There is an show coming up in September that I want to go to, but at this venue. That just may be the thing that keeps me from going."}
{"text":"It's been how many months, and the A/C still isn't fixed?! Major fail! Nice looking place...just need to get their act together!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy going to shows here. The inside is cute like a mardi gras kind of theme.  There is lots of room at the bars and you never wait too long for a drink. There is plenty of space to sit too.  $4 for a PBR is a little much I think but it was a show. The staff was all friendly enough. The bartenders were cute.  It is one of the better place to see a show at. I just wish the drinks were a bit cheaper.  I just wish it wasn't in the heart of stupid Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We had a private company party here last night. Great top notch experience. Definitely worth checking it out."}
{"text":"Horrible. Lied and fabricated statement in order to prevent an event. Unprofessional and ridiculous."}
{"text":"Interesting place. The event I attended there was no hassle or lines getting inside with my free e-ticket. Dos Equis had sponsored a soiree and the place was all jazzed up with strange food and a live band and attractive women handing out scorpion lollypops. I liked the little dark corners on one side of the front bar which was filled with Scottsdale type girls and some Dos Equis random people. The hall was quite large and the place was never crowded. Back-to-Back urinals was a new twist, but never experienced it on my two trips. Upstairs was VIP for some reason, but it just looked like a long balcony. Beer battered shrimp were good and free beer at the event was a plus. It was a nice venue."}
{"text":"This place is ok, we have been there for a concert and then another event, place is laid out well and is reasonably clean..The main issue is the security, when we were there for the concert there was no pat downs at the door, the other event did have extensive pat downs.  What is funny is there was a group of complete douchers drunk as hell trying to get in around the same time we were, initially the Venue would not let them in, but after a while they went ahead and allowed them to enter.  So after all the patdowns and doucher patrol we get in and then it is like security is non-existent and those guys go on to be complete idiots...then we found out the reason for the patdowns:  drink prices are outrageous...$8 for a well vodka in what amounts to a dixie cup worth of watered down drink, can only imagine the price for a non-swill spirit...so it seems the shift in focus for security has gone from actually making sure the patrons are safe to just searching for people bringing in alcohol...who can blame us, $8 for a well is Vegas bar prices...anyways this place is greedy and doesn't have enough events to merit going back, the event we went to wasn't even listed on their website as it wasn't some trust fund baby's graduation party or sweet sixteen...stay snobby Old Town....lol"}
{"text":"We held our company awards event at The Venue this week.  The space is perfect for a celebration.  The food was good, the staff went above and beyond and the AV went smooth.  We had music, light show on stage and a screen for a video.

I planned the event from Dallas, TX and Marissa and Awelle made it happen!  These ladies are professionals!  

The only thing from getting 5 stars was the a/c and cooling of room which is important when everyone is dressed up.  Construction is going on so I understand it was hard to cool down.  

Easy location for everyone to find.  Signage for parking is ample.  Great day!"}
{"text":"It's a neat venue once you get inside but the whole process is incredibly disorganized. I waited 90 minutes to go see a show I already had tickets to. When I went inside, I thought the place would be packed, thus explaining the long wait. Nope. Tons of empty space. The line was so long and so poorly managed that many customers who had already purchased tickets went home. And no refunds for the tickets they bought!
The drinks were also incredibly overpriced. $8.00 for a mixed drink in a plastic cup."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would.  I actually joined yelp expressly to write this bad review.  My friends and I were there for a concert on a Tuesday night.  Concert was supposed to start at 8.  At 10.15, the headlining band still hadn't started playing, but the roof *had* started leaking.  We decided to leave, but before we left we tried to talk to the management to express our disappointment and frustration.  They were entirely unsympathetic, however.  The whole experience was awful.  I will never come back here, no matter how much I might want to see the band, and I will actively recommend that friends don't come here either."}
{"text":"I love the Venue!  I had a great time seeing Authority Zero and several reggae-punk bands here.  The drinks were pretty normal as far as Scottsdale pricing goes, but my friends and I stupidly decided to rock the special - which happened to be $3 Sparks black cans.  Cracked out on energy drinks and plenty of pre-party booze, we proceeded to wander around the massive interior which is modeled after a mardi-gras street (I am a sucker for that stuff!) and eventually head into the mosh pit.  I felt like I wanted to die the next day, but there is no other way I would've rather felt!"}
{"text":"I currently have a contract in place for an event in January 2018. I've reached out to our sales manager for three weeks via email and voicemail multiple times and have not heard a single response back.

Hoping to change this review since our event hasn't even happened yet. As a corporate event planner, this level of service is appalling."}
{"text":"We had a big gathering here for those attending my conference.  The drinks were wonderful, full bar, and the food was also good... fajitas, ceviche, salad, brownies... yummy.

Plus they brought in an Indian Hoop Dancer and 3UG, a local favorite band.  They had pool, the laker game was on, and lots of space for people to mingle.

I don't know what this place is like on a normal night, but for a private party, I enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"We went here last night for the Emmure, We Came as Romans, Woe is Me, and blessthefall show. I really like the venue. It has a really interesting layout, one you wouldn't expect for a show. They have tight security, but I didn't mind. I'd rather wait in line a little longer to prevent getting shanked. They have several bars selling semi-overpriced drinks, which was expected. They have clean, accessible bathrooms and a lot of space to mingle or join in on the pit. The acoustics could have been better, but it was also a hardcore show so I wasn't expecting them to be amazing. They have free parking in a garage right across from the venue as well, which is always nice. I'd definitely see another show here. It also doesn't hurt that Dos Gringos is right across the street!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I love how the inside is decorated. It's also not very big which is what I like when I see a live band. I just wish they had more events here that interested me."}
{"text":"My experience here was last night. I went to a show. It was fucking Shwayze. For some reason I'm slightly embarrassed to admit this. It's because I'm a bit of a music snob. Allow me to correct that..... I'm just a snob.. period. 
I'm a music snob, I'm a wine snob, I'm a food snob.... fuck it, I'm an *experience* snob.

 My snobbery doesn't stem from needing to have (or be around) the \"best of the best\", whatever the hell that means.  It comes from knowing what I like and not giving a shit what you like. Sorry love, it's true. 

It's hard for me to rate my experience here for of a ton of reasons. My company was outstanding.... it would be impossible for me to have a bad time with these peeps. Everyone else around me can rot. Filled with an odd combination of douchebaggery, hipster kids and hookers, it was confusing to the senses. 

The venue itself (as mentioned prior) used to be the Cajun House. It still has the same kind of look to it. It's cute.... kinda.... and pretty small. oddly shaped, \"hall like\". An interesting place to see a show. Interesting can be good and bad. So can The Venue of Scottsdale. Sound quality was weird. I can't really describe it any other way. I go to shows all the time, in much smaller clubs and sound quality has been better elsewhere. 

Disgusting, turd filled, overflowing toilets is also a problem. I've noticed this trend in many a Scottsdale club and I attribute it to all the druggies getting the \"coke shits\" and cramming all that extra paper down the toilets. Dirty whores... 
I'd go back.... but I won't stand in line and I'll make sure to have a catheter in place before I go."}
{"text":"We attended an event which was promoted as \"Beat the Heat -- Arizona Winterfest\" at The Venue Scottsdale today. First off, let me suggest to other promoters that before they commit to a venue for their affair, they should check Yelp reviews. I hope my review turns some future promotors off this location . . . It was, in one word, a disaster.

The idea for the event was a good one. Have a bunch of microbreweries organized to offer their wares in a nice, cool \"Wnterfest\" environment. Instead, because of inept management at The Venue and nothing else, it turned out to be \"A Day in Hell\" for anyone who attended. It was --quite literally -- between 95 and 100 degrees inside the hall. Everyone was mopping their head and wondering, \"How did I get into this mess?\" Really, where would you go in Phoenix in the summer to be in outside temperatures while inside a hall event? Who would put people through such an agonizing episode? 

Because of the heat, people were affected more than normally by the alcohol. The Scottsdale police showed up, wondering why there were so many people getting physically sick. While people were inside trying to get a few beers to pay for their $25 investment, each of them anxious to get out and find some aircon, a fresh batch of suckers would be lined up outside, standing in the sun and waiting to get inside. I guess the promotor could be laughing all the way to the bank? If management had simply cranked the AC down all night long to prepare for this, it could have been salvaged. If you are considering The Venue for any kind of event in our hot months, literally six months of the  year, you ought to reconsider. The place is looking a bit shabby on the inside, there is no air conditioning to speak of, and there's a great shortage of restrooms. Think twice -- this place is a dump."}
{"text":"Lied about police reporting a threat of credible violence to break a contract so they wouldn't be held at fault for cancellation of a sold out speaking event."}
{"text":"Why are you not making a statement regarding tonight's cancellation? Super disappointing."}
{"text":"It takes a special kind of scum to bow to political extremists and cancel an event the day before, then lie and blame it on the police.  Scottsdale PD had to spend much of their time & resources answering questions from the angry ticket holders who had been duped, myself included."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, I had a fashion show and a photo shoot here and both times the whole staff was awesome to work with.  They have done some major renovations since I was there in 2008 for the New Times Best of Party.

I was looking for a unique indoor space to have a fashion show and I found it.  The audience was able to view my runway show from both floors and the open space downstairs.  The staff was on it as far as greeting guests and picking up empty plates from the tables, the fashion went smoothly due to their technical production team, and the managers were nothing short of a dream to work with.

I make wedding gowns and I can see any of my brides getting married here and having their guests leaving impressed with the whole building and the amenities provided by everyone at the Venue Scottsdale.

I mean, they even have a retractable roof.  It was perfect when it was open for my January show.  I completely plan on being here again for many more events."}
{"text":"This is a real nice place to hold an event, just not a beer festival. 
With its four, yes, count them,four urinals in the men's room, this is not exactly the place you want to be during a five hour drinking event. 
I felt like a little kid, standing there, legs crossed with one hand on crotch squeezing, grimacing.
Not really, but I couldn't concentrate on anything that was being spoken since I had to pee so badly. Another good life experience is what I chalked it up to. 
I've always wanted to test the limits of my bladder, similarly to one of those astronauts in that movie 'The Right Stuff'.

The Winter Beer Festival was just ok.
I met a girl who had the most perfect eyebrows I've ever seen. She said they were natural but I don't believe her. They were too perfect. (I'm not gay, but supportive)
I drank some Habanero IPA and burned my throat.
The band was good. 
Venue should offer Frito Lay products instead of Jay's brand potato chips. 
I really could have really used a bag a Cheetos or sour cream and green onion Doritos.
A ride home would have been nice too.
I woke up in a parking lot."}
{"text":"Disappointed that they fabricated a 'fake threat' to get a show cancelled, just because they are afraid of free speech.  Fuck this place.  Hope it gets struck by lightning and burns down"}
{"text":"I am giving this place a one star simply based on the moral compass of its owners. A right-wing political speaker was scheduled to speak here. The establishment decided they didn't want to fulfill the contract with the speaker (this is after tickets were bought). Instead of paying whatever fine they would have had to in order to break the contract, they made false claims of a serious and impending threat of death to the political speaker. This caused the Scottsdale police to have to cancel the event (because it had not been proven to be a bogus claim as of yet). If you think you can run a business like that and no one will care, think again. What a disgrace to the American people and to the American right to freedom of speech and expression. You are the worst form of censorship - censorship by threats and falsification."}
{"text":"I wish more things were booked here, for alot of reasons. If I could change it, I would make them also buy shows instead of just be rented out as a venue. The security staff is pretty awesome as well as the bartenders. Maybe a few less 16 and over shows, to avoid all the kids..."}
{"text":"What about free speech? So sad one of your employees leaked Milo's event! Will never step foot in your 'venue' and this employee needs to be dealt with!"}
{"text":"this is my second time to The Venue, once for a Big Bros/Sisters meeting and yesterday for the scottsdale winterfest (read review). 

the venue itself.....seems ok. i like the new orleans/vegas (meaning you \"think\"  your in new orleans when really you're in the desert). there's plenty of space to move around with several side rooms. 

we never found any bathrooms though. maybe because there were so many people at the winterfest event. and i wonder if there's actually no A/C or if there was a malfunction because it was HOT in there for the winterfest event. 

in any case, The Venue itself was pretty cool....the winterfest was far, far, far from cool."}
{"text":"All I have to say is......
Boycott this place for life.  
The building smells really bad and the restrooms are filthy."}
{"text":"The only thing really redeeming about this location is how unique it looks inside.  My fiance and I attended a work holiday party here last night and there was much left to be desired.  

There were two bars on the main floor with two people working each location; needless to say, the venue was understaffed to cater the drinking needs of 200 people or so.  Not only were there not enough bartenders, the ones working were the worst I've encountered.  I work in the service industry and expect a certain level of professionalism, speed and a quality drink.  It look about ten minutes each time to get a drink; everyone seemed to be diddly-daddling around and didn't seem to understand that a long line should instill some urgency.  On two separate occasions I watched the female bartender pour no more than .25 ounces of liquor into a glass and top it off with soda, and then proceed to charge $8.00 for it.  We found one male bartender that poured a good drink but had the personality of a gnat; he wouldn't even make eye contact with his customers.  

The food was mediocre, and not terribly hot.  The dessert table was pretty good though with cheesecake lollipops and mini cups of chocolate goodness."}
{"text":"Cancellation of events at the last moment, with no valid reasoning other than to impede free speech, should be avoided."}
{"text":"First time at The Venue. I came here to see Comedian Boomer Nichols perform. The comedy area is under a different  name at The Venue. It's called Scottsdale Comedy Spot. The comedy section is  small yet intimate. I was able to sit up front and enjoy the 3 comedians. The staff was very nice. There is a two drink minimum which is totally fine. I never knew this gem existed in Scottsdale. Boomer was awesome by the way!!!"}
{"text":"This venue is HUGE! We recently went to a work event here and couldn't believe the size of this place... multiple rooms inside, lots of space outside and upstairs. Great venue! The food was outstanding... we couldn't get over how delicious it was. They had a fajita station that was very tasty, we had churros and cookies throughout the venue and at the end of the night pizza and sliders. The pizza was super cheesy and delicious. The food makes this place great. The staff... makes this place eh. I don't believe I saw a single smile from any one of the staff members the entire 6 hours we were there. The bartenders were busy, so that's understandable but still... a smile or something would of been nice. Luckily this was an open bar event otherwise I don't think we would of stayed to enjoy the bartenders much longer. A smile or friendliness from at least one employee would of make this the best venue we'd been too."}
{"text":"I was suprised...how good the food was...really a simple buffet Chicken Parm...but great flavor and moist chicken...how hard it that...Anyway the venue itself is funky...long a narrow, so with the event being at the head of the room...hard to feel the buzz of the show...but not too bad...the real issue where the drinks, the bartender trying to pull-off well vodka as grey goose...shame on you!  Overall fun night."}
{"text":"Attended a private event here.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a very large venue in Old Town Scottsdale that felt like a nice concert hall.  I can't believe this isn't used more frequently.  It's located in a part of Old Town that doesn't get much foot traffic at night and the parking is scattered around small lots surrounding the building plus side streets, so it's not a convenient place to visit.  However, the interior is perfect for small to mid size (1000) events.

There's a stage, lighting, and sound already built in as well as large bars and booths, tables, and chairs.  A large dance floor or main room that allows for a variety of design concepts is in the center of the building.

The event I attended used one of the bars and about 3/4 of the room.  It went off without any issues.  I'm seriously considering renting this place for several events I have coming up.

Return Factor - 90%"}

{"text":"Around February I came to watch YANN TIERSEN. Listening to this virtuoso of the music and watching him so close couldn't get better. The place is such a small one for intimate concerts, and yet has space for the ones that want to \"dance\" around. I don't tend to go to concerts and drink, so I have no clue how is that part. I just enjoyed the place for it gave me a chance to enjoy this concert in a very intimate way."}

Good times!!"}
{"text":"I've been here on two separate occassions: for holiday work party and a Childish Gambino concert.

The decor in the venue is unique, New Orleans-style houses are on the top and bottom floors. The layout for the party was nice and it didn't feel congested at all. They had a spread out the food, casino tables and seating equally so people could walk around without feeling trapped. The waiting/ drink staff was friendly as well, though drinks were a little pricy. Parking is adequate: there's a garage nearby and I was able to get in/get out relatively quickly. Also, its walking distance to a bunch of restaurants/shops.

The setup for the concert was simple, just an open rectangle floor for people to gather in front of the stage and parts of the second level were open. The problem is the floor isn't sloped so if you are on the ground floor you can only see the artist perform if you are really up close (and you don't mind getting really close to some people). You can definitely try going on the second level but it fills up quick and for some weird reason they won't move the plants that take space up there. 

Sound quality was subpar. I couldn't understand much of the opening act (Danny Brown) because the bass kept drowning out his raps. The sound was a little better for Gambino but not as clear as other rap concerts i've been to. Overall, I'd highly recommend the place for an office gathering but not a concert."}
{"text":"Tonight we were here for a wedding rehearsal dinner. The place is impressive the moment we walk in. It's decorated like a New York City upscale club. The dj already had great music, the photobooth the bride hired was ready and operating. The roof is retractable which they opened making for a spectacular transition from afternoon to evening.

The buffet was ready on time with a large selection of entrees. I had the short RI s, Romain  alade, potatoes, and grilled vegetables. Tiramisou was the desert. The food was served hot and was delicous.

One very impressive component was the staff to guest ratio. There was an abundance of bartenders,servers, security, and management for our small group.
John Magor was the manager on duty and I got the opportunity to chat with him. Since this is a \"private\" party style place they host some of the hottest celebrities and DJS for exclusive events. He was able to drop some really big names, impressive.

Anyone looking for an exceptional spot for any size party, event, dinner, or special occasion will want to check this place out."}

It may be an okay place to go to see an event, but I wouldn't risk planning an event there.  Big time disaster."}

Shame on The Venue Scottsdale. This fascist act should come with a boycott if the person responsible is not named and does not see repercussion. 
\"According to an e-mail by Sgt. Ben Hoster, Scottsdale Police learned of a proposed speaking event involving Yiannopoulos in Downtown Scottsdale at around noon Thursday, and when they called the business to check on the status of the event, police were told the event was canceled due to security reasons.
'At that point, we concluded our inquiry into the event,' Sgt. Hoster wrote.
Late Thursday night, Yiannopoulos issued another statement on the event's cancellation, claiming the venue where the event was supposed to take place lied about the death threats aimed at him, in an effort to break the contract.\""}
{"text":"We were married at the Venue  Scottsdale on July 6, 2013. Our experience was incredible! The wedding and reception were beautiful and the food was amazing. We received countless compliments on everything from the food to the décor. Guests kept coming up to us all night and raving about the food. We were told by two different guests that if we were on the show \"Four Weddings\" they would have given us all 10's. Deanna and David, our contacts, were extremely helpful through the entire planning process. Deanna was always very quick to respond to our emails and answer any questions we had.  She was very diligent in putting everything together to make sure it what exactly what we had envisioned for our special day.  On the day before and the day of the wedding, she was right there with us setting everything up making sure everything was perfect. She even added little touches that we hadn't even thought of.  Our wedding turned out better than we could have imagined! We highly recommend the Venue Scottsdale for any future brides and grooms, or anyone hosting a special event."}

Well, I'm glad to see I posted a solid rating back then and left room for improvement because let me tell you - they improved it... lots.

This is one of the most beautiful and unique places in the Valley. The current owners have clearly sunk a lot of money into the place to restore it to better than it's former glory. It's absolutely stunning inside. I walked around it during the day and I was awestruck. It's such a gorgeous spot with so much character. 

Perhaps the best part about all of this is that the roof opens up again! It was forbidden for about a decade, but no longer. 

They broke ground recently next door on what will end up being a swanky multi-story ultra lounge, and next to that they opened a new pizza joint - K.I.S.S. I'm anxious to give them a try."}

{"text":"I've only been there once, so maybe it gets better, but not according to the other reviews. We went to The Venue (super generic name, what's up with that?) for the Cults/Foster the People show. First of all, this concert was sold out, so they should know what kind of crowds to expect. But we were stuck in a huge line that took a good 45min to get through. So we missed most of opening act Reptar  (meh, no big loss there).

The layout is a huge rectangular box with a stage at one end. There is a small balcony that runs along one side and at the back, but not many people can fit up there, and those people didn't look all that comfortable. The ones at the very front of the balcony, by the stage, kept getting the lasers from the show in their faces; I saw people standing with their backs to the band and covering their faces.

The stage isn't very high and the floor doesn't slope at all, so if you're not right at the front, all you will see is the backs of other peoples' heads, unless you're very tall. 

I read from other peoples' reviews that they had AC problems at a previous event, but I'm happy to say it was working that night, although it was a pretty cool night anyway due to the huge rain storm. But the roof is canvas and apparently it can open up. They had it closed, but it rained so hard that water came right through the roof and you could see the canvas moving from the force of the wind and rain. But fortunately no one got electrocuted, at least that I heard.

There were multiple issues with distorted sound, feedback and other issues that didn't seem like problems with the band's equipment. I think The Venue's sound guy's method was just to crank it to eleven. The acoustics also don't seem very good there. It still has the old decor from Cajun House, which never seemed conducive to a good concert sound.

It's a pretty cruddy venue to see a show, unless you don't care if you actually see the band. I prefer the Marquee Theater, which is at least laid out so that you have a chance of watching the show, in addition to having a sloped floor. I know a lot of people dislike Marquee, but it is a much better venue for a live show than The Venue."}
{"text":"We were married at The Venue April 2014. It was perfect! We had the ceremony upstairs and then used the bar area for cocktail hour before transitioning into the reception where we felt like everyone had plenty of room to move around, dance and ear. Everyone loved the location in Old Town Scottsdale and they could wake from many hotels and other restaurants since we had many out of town guests. The weather was nice so we were able to have the roof open and we're dancing the night away under the stars. Deanna was amazing during the planning process and the wedding was flawless. The food they made was Perfect!!! The beef tenderloin everyone loved as well as the scalloped potatoes and grilled asparagus. The whole staff was more than helpful throughout the process and we would highly recommend a wedding or other event here. First class location and staff. The bakery the partner with was delicious and many guests said it was the best wedding cake ever- pink champagne. Thank you for the perfect wedding!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to agree fully with Bill (the other reviewer) for his review regarding the event 'Beat the Heat Winterfest'.  I don't understand why this event wasn't canceled when it was so hot with no AC at the facility.  An incredibly disappointment."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with this place.....was looking forward to \"Beat the Heat -- Arizona Winterfest\" at The Venue Scottsdale last Saturday, but as other reviewers have mentioned...it was quite simply a disaster.  No A/C. No A/C. No A/C.  Enough said.

I did at least get my money back."}
{"text":"I've only been once but I'm a big fan. This space is quite nice. My indoctrination to The Venue happened this weekend during the Scottsdale Spice Culinary Event. Tons of people meandered about as we nibbled on food and drink, listening/watching/dancing to a band. Good times were had and we never felt over crowded. 

The old school style of the building, with dark accent wood paneling and incredibly large chandeliers, offered a non-generic experience. The main bar wraps around and is rather large, providing plenty of access to the bartenders. The secondary bar is made for tall people (not the shorties who can't be seen in a crowd, desperately waving a drink ticket). Still great for those over 5'3\". 

The acoustics were phenomenal. I scored parking immediately around the corner so I can't comment on how challenging it might be to find something. (And no, I'm not giving away my new secret.) 

I'd highly recommend this place to attend a music event and to host a private event. Plenty of space to have a large number of people comfortably moving around."}
{"text":"I mean what better place to see go see music AND people on drugs? It's like you're outside in a magical court yard-- yet you are not! whooooaaaa tripey."}
{"text":"The venue decides when and when to not honor contracts. They fabricated a threat to cancel an event and is catering to the political left."}
{"text":"I read another reviewers review of the Oktoberfest event from this past weekend, and I second everything they said. Food was lame.  The brats were a ridiculous $7, and they were served on a terrible baguette bun.  The soft pretzel with cheese was $4 and the cheese was gross, like worse than stadium nacho cheese. What REALLY made me mad is that admission came with 4 drink tickets to get beers.  Since I was the designated driver, I wanted to use some of my beer tickets for soda and they wouldn't let me!  Instead they charged me $4 for a SMALL soda.  UGH, it made me so mad.  Wouldn't come here for Oktoberfest again.

The best thing about the event was the band who played cover songs.  But would it have been so hard to find some polka bands??"}
