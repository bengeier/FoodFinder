{"text":"This place is amazing. I loved the atmosphere and the service. The hookah was delicious and very flavorful. Most of all the GM Stephan was very accommodating and just awesome. He made sure everything was great and really made you feel as if you were welcome and comfortable. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The ambiance in this hookah bar is great, there are a couple private rooms, and there's a great outdoor seating area, which is where we chose to sit. The planes going in and out of LAS can be a bit noisy, but its not too terrible.  The food and drinks were all amazing. Lots of Greek and Israeli fare. Fresh squeezed juice really elevates the cocktails ($12/each, but worth the price).  Unfortunately, I can only give this bar 3 stars because the service. At least to the outside patio, the service was practically non-existent despite the establishment having less than 10 patrons the entire time. We waited 20-30 minutes for someone to check on our drinks (we were ready for a second round), but we had to get up ourselves and go inside to order them. We ordered the hummus(amazing), which after not coming out after 30 minutes, we again went inside to ask about and the order had not made it to the kitchen, again despite the low volume of business.  The exception to this rule was the \"coal fairy\" or whatever you call the guy going around refreshing the coals.  He had excellent timing, showing up consistently when we needed new coals.  Overall, this bar is worth checking out and is only a 30 minute well-lit walk from Bally's. Maybe pick a seat inside, though, so you can call a waitress over when you need one"}
{"text":"We're on our honeymoon from London, me and my wife decided to try some hookah lounges out so we happened to find one called Azuza. We came here ordered food which was real good and tasty, everything was cooked fresh nothing reheated it was obvious. I own a Shisha lounge in London myself but I have never ever ever pulled a hookah so smooth before in my entire life; the smoke was incredibly thick with amazing flavours. Their prices are so reasonable too. The service is real good and they look after you so well here. Be sure to visit, I visited 2 days ago, I'm there again tonight, pure class!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the experience was horrid , I  walked in the walls were painted black with black light bulbs  . I was glowing . The temperature was very warm ,sweating made me  feel uncomfortable. The table was extremely small and confined... plates didn't fit . Service was mediocre at best and the food was not authentic ."}
{"text":"Excellent service !!!  Resonable prices.  Clean, great music, friendly staff kept hookah running smooth and fresh.  I was in Vegas from PA and had a great time here.  Will definately return back whenever in Vegas."}
{"text":"Hookahs  were good  Music was mellow and relaxing  Seating was nice and comfortable   Great if your goin to a small place and want something for the moment"}
{"text":"Best hookah, best food. Moreover awesome service. Will visit this place all the time I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"Hands down the best hookah spot around! From the delicious, authentic Mediterranean food, the friendly and efficient staff, the creative and scenic decor and great music to vibe to... I can definitely say I'll be returning every time I'm in Vegas to recharge for the strip!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great hookah. Great drinks and service. The mint hookahs are the eat. My fave drink that I always get is the horny latte. It's delicious. I seriously could drink those all say. Autum is a great as a sever. Whenever my friends out of town visit we start the night here. It's def a great pregame place."}
{"text":"Azuza is the best hookah spot in Vegas! Great service, staff is like family, and the food is wonderful. You can't beat the atmosphere at Azuza Hookah Lounge."}
{"text":"Great place, great atmosphere, great staff. I have been to a few lounges in the Las Vegas area and this place stands out. Definitively will be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"We love this place! The white gummi bear & watermelon freeze is the best! This is my new Hookah destination in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The place is over priced ... Drinks were bad dint even deserve one star the hookah was try badddd and they charged us twice .....\""}
{"text":"Great place. Excellent service. Was a dog parked in a nearby car for over an hour that was barking and staff was all over it and concerned about health of the dog they called people in. Comped my food for little inconveniences. Can't recommend enough"}
{"text":"Awesome service. Best hookas in the town. Very reasonable price."}
{"text":"just came in, so far so good, slow night, its a wednesday, no shyt.... but overall enviornment is well placed. hookah setup is well done to increase the friendlyness/homefeel of the place. recommend to hookah smokers in las vegas.... price is average, $12 base hookahs, $20 for name brands.... alcohol served.. so far so good...."}
{"text":"I was trying to find a good place to eat late and stumbled across this joint. Really awesome food and tea. I would specially recommend their sliders and sharing is caring entree. Their mint tea is the best I have ever had. Will definitely come here again"}
{"text":"The service here was awesome.  my friends and I came in only a few hours before close...a rowdy group of drunk white people :S  They were so nice and helpful...a few of the ladies even did some shots with us :)  Drinks were pretty expensive but I understand they need to make their money.  I'd rather pay more for drinks and great service than have cheap drinks and crappy service!  I haven't tried the food yet but I'll be sure to get on that ASAP!"}
{"text":"Great hookah, delicious food ( we tried the chicken Kabob and freshly made bread) , very friendly staff. I will definitely go back when I visit Vegas in the future ."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food!!! Had the Jollyrancher drink which I would recommend!!! Everything was delicious and staff are wonderful! Definitely a must!!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Totally a place to relax an chill.  Food...hookah...music...just a great to relax from a long day!!!"}
{"text":"Best hookah ever def will come back here the food was young good customer service everything was on point"}
{"text":"Good place to hang out! Their service was really good...they checked on us a lot and refilled our coals often. Check in for a free hummus plate which was surprisingly delicious. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food as well as an outstanding environment. Amazing drink concoction delicious and a lot house made mixtures. Staff was very welcoming with great service they knew every question I had and catered to any flavors of hookah I needed.  It's defiantly a chill relaxed intimate casual place to hang out with your friends. I loved the variety of music they had. I will defiantly be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went for hookah and a light meal with low expectations. Little did I know the food would be incredible and reasonably priced. They had a large selection of shisha and were well versed in the different brands.  I loved the fact it wasn't a \"dine and dash\" and the staff routinely stopped by to service the coals. The only negative was the drink prices, but hey... this is Vegas."}
{"text":"Quick bullet guide:  - Turkish Iced Latte - Phenomenal service. Very hospitable, prompt, and effective. - Ingenious in-table Hookah design. - Alcohol available - Great, smooth hookah - BUBBLES (dish soap water / bottle on request)"}
{"text":"I like this place because the staff and owner are super nice.  Even their food is pretty good too. I will definatly recommend to my friend."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere.. and the service is perfect. The best hookah in LV. Try the double apple (Alnakhlah), its really amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Highly recommend also a great vibe. The food is fresh and satisfying!  Make sure to schedule time, due to the food being fresh, they need time to prepare, but def worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great food, great hookah, great ambiance, and great service. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hookahs where tasty but I didn't get the smoke I wanted out of it, it was hitting real light and I kept flagging down the staff to fix it , the customer service was awesome but the prices and quality of the items were a bit iffy"}
{"text":"The staff here is fun and down to earth. Takes a little long for the food but overall a great time."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool.  Usually smoke my hookah at the Olive which is another cool place.  Food was top notch.  Music wasn't too loud. Just right to have a conversation.  Place was clean and staff was cool.  Go check it out."}
{"text":"It is nice place close to the strip , nice service and good flavor hookah I been there twice it is my favorite . I like the decoration is awesome and the friendly host. The music is nice with big flat screen and the seats are comfortable. The variety of hookah flavor and they but cold water with ice I'm it that make a lot of difference if you taste and I recommend the cherry flavor. I strong recommend this place for quote Tate  of hookah.  Of you do not have a ride do not worry as the hard rock is just 5 min walking across the street so plenty of taxi there take you back to your hotel."}
{"text":"Azuza hookah lounge is without a doubt THE BEST hookah lounge in Vegas!!! I've been to several spots in Las Vegas as well as LA, none of them can compare. The service and people are amazing! The atmosphere is warm and inviting with an excellent music selection. It's the best place in town to relax and unwind with friends or to begin the turn up process. Libby, Eric, V, Ashley and the Daniels x 2 as well as all the staff here make this the quintessential spot to be!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite hookah spot in Vegas. Whenever I come to town I hang out once or twice here. Vanity and Chris are awesome fun servers. They're so accommodating and friendly!! Today vanity suggested some food options to is and we took her suggestions. No disappointments! Everything was delicious and the portions were generous. Live the Arabic music too! A great spot! (Just a little cold in here right now - burrrr)!"}
{"text":"Please note I am middle eastern and my expectations of hookah and a hookah lounge are probably very different than a non middle eastern hookah lover.  as soon as we walked in we were greeted very nicely. the staff was very polite...no complaints there... my start rating is based on environment and hookah quality.   the place was practically empty since it was a random Thursday night. we had three people in my party. we sat at the big comfortable corner, they asked us to move since there was a minimum of 4 to be able to sit there. that bothered me since the place was empty and we wanted to be comfortable. not to mention It was not a smart business decision since my group of three middle eastern women were going to each order one hookah which is more than what a group of non middle easterners would smoke which Is generally one per two people (which is Another rule of theirs.. minimum one hookah for 2 people) the hookah prices were high but I guess that's just vegas my hookah and my friends hookah had an overwhelming mint flavor. when I told them, they switched the hose out and I ended up with a plastic china hose instead of a traditional hose. not ok for me. they didn't like that I took the foil off the hookah head, but I don't like to smoke like that.  the place is not a place to go if you are hoping for a traditional middle eastern hookah experience. i don't want to wrap the parameter of the heads w foil, i don't want to sit on couches that have no backs, i don't want to smoke hookahs that are sitting on top of tables (hard to reach to rearrange coal) and i don't want to taste mint when i order grape... I also don't want to sit in an uncomfortable table and see 3 open corners just cause I didn't meet the minimum requirement of how many people need to be in my group just to sit there.   note: the staff really tried and was very friendly."}
{"text":"This has been probably the best place I went to that cook the lamb perfect. Also the drinks and hookah was great as well. If I ever return to Vegas I definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"They were amazing. This was my first hookah experience, and we had an amazing time.   I highly recommend after Hoffbrauhouse. We will be coming here every time we come to Vegas from now on.  Fantastic teas, great shisha, friendly and relaxing (not slow or neglectful, just made the whole experience easier) service, lovely people."}
{"text":"The best hookah place in town. Great hookah. Great food. Great service! Best tea in the world"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place!!! Friendly service from everyone. After a long week at work this was an amazing atmosphere to relax and smoke hookah."}
{"text":"This is place is great!!! The food is amazing and most importantly the hookah is one the best I had."}
{"text":"One of my favorite low key spots. I love ordering jasmine tea and the coconut chicken satay has really good flavor."}
{"text":"Nice chill spot.  A little warm inside.  But easy menu and no rush attitude.  Rayna really helped me out . Will be back."}
{"text":"When you first walk in,  it's hard to see inside because the lighting is so dim.  When your eyes adjust you can see that this place is beautiful inside. The service is great and the sheesha is great.  I had the Nakhla  Double Apple. This is a very nice place to relax and have great conversation with friends."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food. We stopped by for some Hukka and food, ordered the guava watermelon flavor.  Chicken satay was on point. The ambience is pretty chill with a friendly staff.  We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Smooth and tasty hookah.  Great hummus and pita bread. Friendly service.  A must try for happy hour."}
{"text":"This is our favorite hookah bar in Vegas. The atmosphere is so chill and laid back. We love getting one of the private rooms and just relaxing. The BF really knows his hookah and he loves it here. They are long lasting and come around frequently to make sure all is ok. The service is always on point. We've never ordered the food, however, we might just do that next time we stop in."}
{"text":"Wow, there are so many hookah lounges in Vegas!  That is one thing you do not get to experience in Hawaii, unless you set one up in your living room.    When I first walked in, I noticed that its pretty dark in here.  It is nothing like Rhumbar, which is well-lit (and obviously outdoors).  There are booths and cushioned sofas against the walls.  I like the lighting of the tables where the hookahs were placed.  Bf said the bathrooms are cool, maybe the mens bathroom has more decorations.  The womens bathroom is nothing special but its very clean at least!  Another thing about the atmosphere is that they play a lot of good music, and there are music videos playing on the mounted TVs... Yet they do not match.  I guess they dont have surround sound yet!   Another cool thing is they put ice in the water so you get better smoke.  We ordered a Starbuzz Pink flavor and it was pretty tasty.  I liked that there was always someone walking around to change coals (kind of dangerous looking basket with hot coals).    We did not order any food, but the kabobs smelt really good.  We did have a drink.  I think somewhere on the menu it says all hookah orders come with one drink order per person (but not included in the hookah price).  They have menu sets that come with entrees, a bowl of hookah, and a drink for two people, three, and so on.    The service was not bad, all the guys that work there were really nice.  I ordered a shot of ouzo straight and the guy who brought it to me kept asking me if I wanted it on the rocks.  Well it was probably the strongest drink I have ever had but I wasnt about to change my mind for him.  Good looking out, man!  We also got 15% off our bill thanks to the Yelp deal! Sweeeet.    Its all good.  We had a relaxing time here and left happy. I may come back again."}
{"text":"Shisha here is reasonably priced and the food is quite good if you are feeling peckish at night."}
{"text":"Not only was the vibe smooth and a breath of fresh air from the corny tackiness that is Vegas,  but they have a solid food menu! From the traditional kabobs, to salads. What I love most is that they had proper tea... and served properly!  Hookah & tea is the rice & beans of the middle east and this place has this marriage available!  Music on point!  Vibe on point!  And service on point!"}
{"text":"Very good Hookah (Shisha) at this place also nice waitress love this cafe absolutely will visit them again"}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time 4 weeks ago and been coming here once a week ever since. Customer service is great as they always check up making sure everything is ok.   Recommendation - pineapple bowl, jungle juice base & a tropical mint flavor."}
{"text":"Love this place everyone is always friendly. I come to chill out and relax by myself before I head out for the rest of my night.  The hookah here is strong and they come by often to check your coals.  It can get crowded if you come after 10p, but I never have a problem finding a seat. If you smoke cigarettes they have a closed off hookah area outside.  Very cool vibe with good music and usually on ESPN."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of hookah bars, and this one was quite easily the worst. The service was ridiculously slow, and the hookah tasted kinda funky. I ordered some Moroccan mint iced tea that was strange tasting as well. Luckily, the diet coke I ordered to replace the mint iced tea was normal. Though I'm not sure what other options there are for hookah in Vegas, I would recommend avoiding this place."}
{"text":"Nice and relaxing place for hookah! Service here is beyond excellent! Eric & his team are awesome, they come check on us and change the coals often to ensure everything is ok."}
{"text":"Azuza never fails to satisfy! Whenever I am near downtown (or- simply want to drive further for great hookah and service) this is the place. They come around frequently for coals, good flavor that doesn't make me sick like most hookah shops, and a perfectly lit atmosphere for the cherry on top! Worth the higher price than some other places. Also 21+ keeps the tweens away! :)"}
{"text":"The staff was incredibly accommodating. The atmosphere was excellent, very laid back and relaxing. The hookah was great and well attended to and the food was good. It was a bit pricey but that is to be expected that close to the strip. I will go again."}
{"text":"I just tried hooka for the first time tonight. The staff was very attentive and gave great recommendations. The decor was dark but didn't feel creepy. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Azuza. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but I just am not impressed. It's a shame because the hookah and tea are excellent. The service....HORRIBLE.  So my boyfriend ordered a whiskey and coke. The man next to us orders a coke, takes a sip of it and tells the waitress that it is not coke! she rudely brushed him off and said \" yes i know for a fact that it is\" and walked away. My boyfriend takes a sip of his drink and it is just coke! so she mixed our drink orders up. I had to get up out of my seat to find her, and tell her what happened. She than got an attitude and told me I was wrong  and they had \"bad coke\" which was to blame. wait what?: than she finally realizes what happened, and apologized. At this point i was pretty annoyed and it takes a lot to get me going. The same girl was hiding in the back and walking around pretty much doing nothing the entire long 2 hours we were there.   We ordered 1 hookah which came with a free refill, hummus, chicken satay and 2 well drinks and 1 tea pot. Our total bill was $80 which i found to be overpriced.   if you are looking for overpriced hookah,too much coal causing the hookah to burn out, expensive drinks, mediocre food and horrible service than this is your place.  I will stick to the Olive. Definitely  better atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Cannot stop raving about this amazing hookah bar... Amazing service, amazing food, and amazing hookah. The manager, libby is so awesome... And remembers you from just one meeting! I will always come back to this super chill joint no matter how far from Vegas I am. This is the best hookah lounge my husband and I have been to..."}
{"text":"Place is simply awesome. Has a cool and relaxing vibe, best hookah lounge I've gone to so far"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep giving this place another try... Service is terribly slow. From ordering drinks to getting the check, wait time was too ridiculous. Workers were not attentive. They see us waiting and looking bored but never cared to stop by. They never came by to refill the coals. It's really not that hard to observe your customers once in a while.   Also, the free appetizer coupon for first check-in was bogus. During my first time here, the waitress said they do not accept the coupons via phone apps anymore, and I would have to print it out and give it to them. C'mon, how is anyone supposed to know to print the coupon if it's their first time checking-in?   Spend your time and money on something else folks."}
{"text":"Best Hookah spot in Vegas. I am from SoCal and an avid hookah smoker. When I am in Vegas this is the only hookah spot I go to. Azuza is the best hookah bar to  chill out and lounge.   Great staff and service from Daniel, David, Reyna, Libby, V, Eric.. Thank You Azuza and staff for amazing hiokah experience!!!"}
{"text":"Fastening vibe and Vegas Strip friendly. Staff takes care considerably and is very current. Love the scenery! Thank you Azuza staff. xoxo ACE ENCORE"}
{"text":"I have heard a lot about this place.when i checked  the hookah menu, didnt understand why so much restrictions for a hookah.i have been to egypt and didn t see such rules."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE! They overcharged me $15 and I did not notice this until I checked my bank statement. I called and talked to them multiple times and they never returned my call and ignored it. Waste of time and money. Would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Daniel is the best. Thank you for a pleasant evening. You will definitely see me back again. Great customer service"}
{"text":"Had such an amazing time here with my boyfriend!! So we were driving around Vegas to different hookah spots however they all seemed to be pretty packed. I called Azuza and they told me the wait was 45 minutes so we ended up going back to the hotel. 20 minutes later a nice waitress called me and told me they had a VIP room available for us and that she would hold it for us till we arrived. I was really impressed that they remembered my number and called me back!! We arrived and the music was great!!! Customer service was good too. They Played all the new jams and old school we were turning up the entire night. Drinks were at a great price and of course the Hookah was great!!. I will for sure return to this spot."}
{"text":"Best hookah lounge in Vegas by far. Daniel is the truth! Very accommodating! Coolest guy ever!"}
{"text":"Libby and the staff here are great! Living here 10yrs now, and I wish I've came much sooner. My 2nd time here and it's a wonderful experience. The staff here always checks on you to make sure you're doing well. It's a great atmosphere for socializing, as well as coming here to strengthen yourself when you're seeking inspiration.  Whether you're a guest from out of town, or a local like myself, you feel like you're part of the family here.  This is how a business is to be managed and maintained. Other companies take note. THIS is quality service."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Vegas this place is a must stop! The Hookahs are the best in the city and Stephen is the GM and if he is here he will stop by chat with you and shows you a great time!  If you don't come by you are losing out!"}
{"text":"Love the service and ambiance of this hookah spot.  Delicious food and you have to try the flavored iced teas."}
{"text":"My first time here and had a great experience. Everyone was friendly and service was prompt. Eric was on top of everything and he made our experience really enjoyable. Definitely would come back here just for him. Him and one of the other workers, Daniel, were great.   The hookahs were great and flavorful, not too harsh. Really great atmosphere and the music was great and fit the mood of the place.   Definitely would come back here for the service these guys gave."}
{"text":"I should start by saying I love hookah!  Now I am going to say that this is the best place I have smoke and drank at.  Maybe it was because we got a private room or maybe it was because the service was excellent or maybe the tea was great or maybe I had too many shots but I was thrilled!"}
{"text":"I've been a supporter of this hookah lounge for years. The service is top notch. Great music and a very attentive staff.  Great flavors. Try the Poms on your Sweet Melon. They also have very nice flowering teas. Just tried the new Thai tea and it is really good!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great with good music, food & service. I want to give it more stars but the drink prices are just too high."}
{"text":"We went here last weekend. When we first walked in the staff was all over us meeting all of our needs for hookah and drinks. I ordered a Horney Latte cocktail and it was delicious. The hookah we got started out nice, but it lost flavor and thickness fast. We wanted more coals, but the staff stopped coming around to ask how we were. We had to keep asking them to adjust our coals for us. When we were ready to leave we kept trying to get their attention, but nobody even looked at us so my husband had to go up to the front to get our check. And the music they were playing just was not very good at all. Not a good experience and we probably will not go back."}
{"text":"This is the worst place ever!!! Hookah was good but if you want to pay for a service & be treated like shit then this is definitely the place to go. Our waitress was a complete A-hole!!!! My friend & I went there thinking we'd have a good GNO but instead we were treated like dirt.  The young guy changing out the coals was nice enough to take our order. When we asked him to get our waitress he signaled to her to come & told her we needed something....she in turn waved for him to handle us after she saw it was our table.  Never going back!! Too bad too cuz we tend to smoke A LOT of hookah with all our friends. This all went down @ the Charleston location"}
{"text":"Super chill spot in Vegas. This is one of the better hookah spots in Vegas.  I wish that I could have eaten some of the food but I didnt so maybe next time? The prices were cool and the host/hostess were really on point and welcoming. I would mos def come back."}
{"text":"The service here was better than any other hookah bar I've ever been too. Good selection and reasonable prices.  I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Very rude and disrespectful staff. Empty chairs and did not want to seat us. Been to plenty of hookah lounges and this one was by far the worst. Vegas's best is olive lounge."}
{"text":"As a Vegas local, this place is great. For being so close to the strip they have excellent prices, amazing service and chill music. I love how they are open until 3 on Saturdays as well as the quality of their drinks and hookah. We got the jasmine/mint mix and they gave us ice in base with great coals for free. We sat in the private room for free, which was awesome. The manager, Steven sat with us and would chat and care about what we thought.   This is by far the best hookah lounge I've been to, and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Best hookah lounge in Las Vegas! Nice mix of locals and tourists. Plus the hookahs, food, music and drinks are on point!"}
{"text":"Words cannot describe this amazing place! Great customer service, mouth watering food and good vibes! What more can we ask for?"}
{"text":"My favorite hookah in Vegas... Mediterranean food is amazing here as well.... lamb chops...kebobs everything was authentic.... Staff are super friendly and know what they do.... Five stars for Azuza!!!"}
{"text":"This hookah Lounge is a nice place to come relaxed and just vibe! It's located right across the street from the Hard  Rock hotel. Came here with my sister around 10:30pm and the main area was packed with folks on a Sunday as well as there patio (which is always a good sign). We were seated in their VIP section (there is no extra charge for this area) in a enclosed section with a walk way. The place itself is dark and from what I saw clean.  We ordered a few things from the menu since we were hungry after a show. The Peach Bellini was $14 and tasted good, the Ka-Baba-Q with beef was $15 and it was good although the beef was quite tough to eat, the CryBaby Curry with chicken was $13 very good and spicy and lastly we had the watermelon freeze hookah for $20 and added a vanilla alcohol flavored base for $10. Total bill came to about $77 with taxes.   Overall I am satisfied with my visit. This place will be a go to every time I visit Vegas and I definitely recommend if you want a relaxing, chill time with friends and good eats."}
{"text":"Great service, awesome outdoor seating and the hookah flavors and selection were great"}
{"text":"awesome place & they play reggae during the day!!! awesome choice of music, good food, and great customer service!"}
{"text":"Great experience, good service, chill atmosphere. Staff was very attentive, made sure our hookah was just right. Have just tried the hookah, but will have to try the food options next time. Very nice evening, not too loud or crowded. Impressed by the professionalism of the staff and the cleanliness of the venue. Have been looking for the best option in Vegas for a while, and this seems to be it."}
{"text":"Libby thanks for the experience! Great service and atmosphere! Off the strip but a must visit venue! Ask for Libby, she will make sure you have everything you need to enjoy a good drink and hookah!"}
{"text":"I love coming here after work. Very relaxing environment inside, or if you prefer, enjoy outside. Flavors are good, and the food is excellent. My only complaint is that sometimes the food comes out very slowly. Other than that, I've never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"I think we got ripped off here as the \"drunk tourists.\" It's off strip (we walked) but there were all these rules about number of hookahs, drink orders, etc. Also, they were not happy that we had pizza from next door but were just passive aggressive about it.  Lots of selection on flavors. Overall, a too expensive & inside was so smoky 2 of our friends got ill just walking in."}
{"text":"Awesome place to be great music and shout out to our service Libby she sweet and great customer service thank you so much!!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place.  We called them 2 hours before closing to see if they could accommodate our group. They were happy to have us and took the absolute best care of us during our entire stay. They even offered to stay open later because they knew we were there for a special occasion.    Hookah prices are great, drinks are a little pricey but this is Vegas. The staff is what made our visit so amazing. Everyone was so attentive and patient with us, it was amazing. Can't wait to go back and give them more business and recommend them to everyone."}
{"text":"Good hookah lounge. Friendly staff, wide selection of hookah flavours. Nice place to chillout."}
{"text":"They treat people based on their ethnicity. I walked in and they told me there is no table while the facts is there are two table available.. then he told me to wait outside until one spot available and he is going to call me.. i wait outside for half an hour without even care about my present, then a couple comes over asked the lady for table and she asked them do you have a table? They said no. She said go inside ask the guy if there is availability.. they walked in front of me asked him about a table, he gave them one of the two empty table without ask.. he never came to me, this place is racist and i wont go there ever.. too bad experience"}
{"text":"During my recent trip to Vegas with my husband, we decided to visit Azuza for a relaxing night of hookah! We found this place a very short distance from the strip! I must say, the customer service was better than any I've ever experienced at any hookah lounge (and I've been to many). Libby was awesome!!! The atmosphere was intimate, they serve food and alcohol, and the hookah was smooth and perfect the entire time! They stay on top of refilling drinks and changing out coals, to maintain your excellent smoking experience! I definitely enjoyed Azuza and will be returning when I visit Las Vegas again!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a hookah bar in a long time, and I never would have even thought about going here, but we finished dinner at Ferraro's and didn't feel like going to the Strip. Somehow, we looked up and stumbled upon this Azuza. It was a really great hidden gem!  The ambiance was typical hookah bar- Middle Eastern decor, lots of comfy couches, dark lighting.  The hookahs were very good and were serviced regularly. They have a guy who walks around doing tricks with the hot coals, so that was pretty cool. The music was fantastic- top 40/hip hop, which was perfect. Enough to feel like you were having a night out, but not so loud that you can't have a conversation. They even have private/VIP rooms. The seating is comfortable and the service is also good.  The only downside is that the drinks are rather pricey, especially since this is not a Strip bar/lounge. I definitely wasn't expecting $15 cocktails here. They were fine, but nothing special. The bathroom also could have been a bit cleaner.   We even saw Flava Flav here, so that was a fun surprise!"}
{"text":"Overpriced meals and drinks ($8 for a beer?) plus service staff was too talkative and too slow in their actions. We also noticed the mixed drinks were watered down (twice,) and the tobacco had burned out within 20 minutes. Our friends that regularly go don't notice the high prices because they said the staff usually gives them hookups. But not tonight. My friends tobacco also burned or quickly we are not returning to this place with these prices and the quality of the tobacco. Another gripe I had was the seating, it's like a fire hazard waiting to happen."}
{"text":"Firstly. The hookahs here are hardcore, this is the most real hookah in Nevada if not the whole states. The tea is second to none, the food is amazing. Staff is really friendly, Mina, Danial, Leah, David and Rina. My salutes and thanks to you guys.   I would advice always calling before coming if you're coming late to make sure you find a good spot to sit.   But believe me, if you wanted to try a hardcore, real deal, true hookah... it doesn't get any better. I've been smoking hookah for the last 15 years and tried everywhere in 3 continents. I would say this place ranks in my top 3, if not 2, No Doubt!!"}
{"text":"This Place is Fantastic.  Super cool service and act that takes place with the coals!  This place is a must visit!"}
{"text":"Coming from hookah know-it-all who tried out several different lounges during her Vegas visit, I can honestly say Azuza does not disappoint. Not only are the bowls on point, the service is nothing short of excellent. During my 4 day trip I was here 3/4 days and each experience I had was superb. 5 stars all the way! You MUST try this place."}
{"text":"works like a strip bar...... we were greeted to sit down on a table of five, after we ordered food we were rudely asked to switch tables, we didnt mind so we asked to be seated in a bigger table since our options were to move to a much smaller table.  The owner came over and was worse than his own staff, and demanded we move now since a big shot is coming...  Again we said we didnt mind we just needed a bigger table lol... The owner then aggressively told me this table was a mistake by our staff for you to sit here, this was one hour later of us sitting. He then snapped hookah from me and asked me and my group to get the f**k out.  So we did politely without an issue, the arrogance of this place left a bad taste in my mouth.  Basically if you dont know the owner, dont go! or else someone who knows the owner will be taken care of instead of you.  Good Luck!"}
{"text":"Azuza one of my favorite hookah lounges to go to in Las Vegas. Super classy. The workers are like family and will always make your experience a pleasant one!!! Go go go go!"}
{"text":"Not the best hookah bar I've been to but not the worst either. Staff is friendly unless someone else is there. A little pricey but chill place. Food is served but I didn't try. Just a little small although they offer private rooms but for more money. Most hookah lounge that is standard. They need to expand to get my business again."}
{"text":"Best lounge ever, super chilled. They make you feel like family, Libby, David & Eric.....thank you for always making our night EXTRA."}
{"text":"Libby is super amazing every time I come in! She always remembers me. The food is great for a awesome price and hookahs always hit superb!"}
{"text":"Our visit to Azuza was excellent! The Lounge was gorgeous, very thoughtfully built for customer convenience. Hookah flavor and drinks are excellent! I would definitely recommend this hookah lounge to everyone. Servers are sweet!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Everything about the place was great from drinks to food to hookah."}
{"text":"I loved it here.   The menu is clear.  Prices are fair.   The ambiance is prefect. I could stay here all day/night.   The staff were exceptional.   This place has already been recommended to friends and I will continue to do so.   I say yes!"}
{"text":"The best hookah lounge in Vegas! You're treated like family with great accommodation, excellent customer service and wonderful food and beverages. Everyone is a rockstar!!! The atmosphere is as chill and top notch as the staff. Thank you Eric aka hookah man, Libby aka boss lady, and Daniel x's 2...the Allstars of Azuza Hookah Lounge!!!  -Trentina"}
{"text":"Bad bad bad , im 23 i forgot my wallet at home they kicked us out because  dont have ID we were 3 and then 2 has their ID except for one never going to that place no more! Service is very bad! So disappointed smh  Its not funny for whoever rated this shit"}
{"text":"I love coming here , service is always amazing with Libby she goes out of her way to really make you feel comfortable. Looking for good hookah & drink + great service come here ."}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees!  Absolute best hookah lounge in the city! Hands down. A-1 service!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing service! Amazing hookah! Good music. Good vibe! Definitely a place to visit when I'm Vegas! Loved it and will definitely return when in Vegas !"}
{"text":"Hookah took a while to get, very easy on the tobacco it burned in a hurt beat also they charge per cut of tea instead of unlimited refill and a cup is $4 each for a tea that is normal tea and not premium tea of any kind. Refill on tea is $2 each and the server do not tell you that refill is $2 is that ok?  nothing out of ordinary just a regular hookah place with a hot girl working/owning the place."}
{"text":"While this is not my thing, my wife was dying to go to a Hookah Bar.  I must say, we found the right place.  The services was excellent and we had a great time."}
{"text":"One of the best hookah place in North America. Get a mix platter \" sharing is caring\" The service was Royal. The Moroccan tea with mint is to die for! Four of got seated without any wait time. Lots of smiling servers."}
{"text":"A good mix of people and good times ! Get there early because this spot fills up quick!!!!!  Great drinks and AWESOME food!!! I'm going tonight!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hands Down The Best Hookah Bar in Las Vegas.  This place is run by true professionals.  From AMAZING customer service to AMAZING hookah to AMAZING food.  My friends and I had a great time.  Myself, being a supplier of hookah shisha to hookah bars in a Pennsylvania and my friend who was with me, the owner of a hookah bar in Pennsylvania,  we actually took notes.  We've seen them all, but this place was on top of my list.  Azuza actually sets an example of how a hookah bar should be run.  The manager was very nice and made us feel very welcome.  She looked like she really enjoyed being there.  The hookah prep guy was very nice and stayed on top of things.  I'll definitely be in next time I'm in Vegas.  Thanks guys and keep up the awesome work."}
{"text":"Great service, good Hookah, and good food for a decent price. I would definitely suggest this place if you are looking for a chill hookah lounge while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great place, awesome ambience, beautiful people and servers, customer service was outstanding. Highly recommend this place very affordable."}
{"text":"Loved the Pineapple bowl, but their servers were never around. It was so hard to ask for Marie water, which they charge you like $3.50 for each bottle of water instead of a glass of ice water. Our bowl was almost gone before we got a second round of coals... just not good service. But the bowls had good flavors."}
{"text":"When the hookah craze came about, I was interested but never got around to trying it. Fast forward a couple of years, and Azuza is the first hookah lounge I went to. It was a very good experience. I can't remember which flavored hookah we had, but we enjoyed it. I also had a tasty Jolly Rancher cocktail. Members of the staff came around often enough to check on us and the coals for the Hookah. We also had a cup of Turkish coffee. I don't drink coffee often, but this was the best cup I've ever had. The atmosphere is so laid back and relaxing here. Azuza is a great choice for hookah in Vegas."}
{"text":"When you enter, it is VERY dark. On the right, there are all the booths and on the left there's one long couch with a bunch of tables and hookahs lined up. There was only one group of people when we came in and no one by the door, so we waited a few seconds and a guy came out from the back to seat us. We were solely there to have some tapas and we explained that to him. He gave us a small booth in the back, which was nice and secluded and he took out two of the hookahs (there was 3 on the tiny table) so we could have room for the food. We couldn't help but bust out our cameras because the place just looked so sexy! The dark red and blue lighting, painted walls, and orange lit hookahs just gave it a very hip look.   We perused through the menu, which included some funky names such as \"Wanna eat a pita?\" and \"Sum Yum Guy Satay\" that we both found pretty amusing. They also had a decent list of teas, including flowering tea ($12 a pot) and even some smoothies. We ended up ordering the following:  White Rose Tea - Very aromatic. I added a little sugar to mine and it was just perfect. Very subtle and relaxing. I can't get over the scent!  Mo'Rockin Beef Bowl (Slow cooked rib-eye on a bed of jasmine white rice) - This came in a pretty big bowl, which was perfect for sharing. However, Don enjoyed it a lot more than I did. I personally found it to be a little bland, but the meat was very tender  Sharing is Caring Sampler ($16), included the following:  Not Your Fava Bean Dip (\"Fool Mudammas\" mixed with onions, cilantro, tomatoes, and olive oil) - I actually liked this more than the hummus. It was smooth and it really did taste like a mild bean dip. Very good with the pita bread  Sweet N Sweeter Chicken (Baked chicken honey on a bed of clementines) - Again, Don enjoyed this more than I did. I think it's more of an acquired taste that I can imagine many people liking, but it really just tasted like chicken that was rolled in honey bunches of oats to me, so I found it a little odd.   Stuff it up your Kofta Kabob  (Marinated Egyptian ground beef stuffed with feta cheese and grilled on a skewer) - We both liked this a lot. The meat was juicy and flavorful, so I ended up pairing it with the caprese on the side.  Mo'Rockin Caprese (Feta cheese with tomatoes, cilantro, and Thai basil) - The feta was a little overpowering for me, so I ended up only eating all of the tomatoes with the Kabob, but they were very fresh and went perfectly with the kabob.  This Isn't About Me, It's About Hummus - This came on a big dish with a basket of pita bread. It was pretty grainy, but the flavor was just right and, when mixed with the bean dip, it made for a very pleasant dip.  Jo' Momma's Baklava (Fillo dough pastry stuffed with candied almonds and walnuts) - I've never had Baklava before this, so I didn't know what to expect. I liked that it came out nice and warm. It was also very flaky, which I am always a fan of and it had a delicate sweetness that was just right. Don, however, thought it had a \"weird\" taste, but I didn't detect that.   The service was top notch, even though they didn't fill up our water glasses every single time they went empty, but that was completely understandable because the place is very dark. You can tell they really work as a team here because we were always checked up on and served by about four different people. The music was actually pretty good. They had a variety of reggae and some pretty upbeat music. I noticed they even accept requests. Some guy in one of the other booths ended up requesting \"Bad Boys\" and started dancing.   My only real complaint is that their tables are WAY too small. At least if you're there to eat, which I'm sure majority of the customers aren't there for. All of our plates were given to us one by one because there wasn't room for a lot at once. This was just a small problem though, since the place is a hookah lounge and not an actual sit down restaurant.  All in all, we really enjoyed coming here. The ambiance was awesome and the service was tiptop. If we come here again I definitely want to get a hookah, maybe Fruit Loop flavor, and try their Cheesecake Lollipops. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place was great!  Our server Mariah was extremely helpful and attentive.  We had three different tapas split between 2 of us, but we probably could have done with just 2 as the portions were pretty generous by tapas standards.  The food itself was delicious.  I highly recommend the kofta sliders!  We ordered a large pot of the Egyption aliwizah(?) tea which our server regularly kept filled to the brim with hot water without any asking.  The hookah itself was the smoothest we've ever had and the staff were great about coming around regularly to knock off the ash.  The flavor itself wasn't spot on (we had 'pumpkin pie'), but it was still pretty good.  Would highly recommend if you're looking to take a nice relaxing break from the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"Place is clean. Drinks are $12-15 not bad. And go to Reyna. She's awesome, knows the menu, quick. Definitely recommend.  Hookahs are $20."}
{"text":"We are from L. A. And we have been here first time. They are cool. Nice service.... good job guys :)"}
{"text":"Came in for a mellow night in Vegas. Their service was outstanding. Everyone of them from the superstar servers to the coal guys were all great. Good vibes."}
{"text":"Best place to smoke hookah in Vegas. Food was amazing! The sharing is caring is the best with the salad. You need to come here if you are in Vegas. $17 hookah happy hour and buy one get one cocktails."}
{"text":"I mostly come here with my lady since I don't smoke hookah...but the atmosphere is chill. Usually good music goin. Cool people. Nobody is rowdy. Staff is real knowledgeable. One drink minimum for everyone. Free WiFi."}
{"text":"Good shisha? Yes, please.  Azuza is a great place to relax and unwind after you've gambled or danced the night away, or maybe both.  The staff is super friendly and the menu is great. Sliders and fries to go along with your hookah is always a great idea. The only downside is that it gets busy early on so get here early :)"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, staff is super nice. Drinks were horrible. I had a Long Island, it tasted like sprite, super watered down. I also had a shot of Fireball and  Patrón, they were ok, not even slightly typsy. I believe the hookah and drinks were overpriced."}
{"text":"First time coming to this place and I really enjoyed it. We sat towards the back in one of the more private rooms and it was really relaxing. The lights were dim and out server was really nice and to top it off she was beautiful. Over all had a great experiment here."}
{"text":"I have to give Azuza Hookah Lounge it's props! They have consistently been one of the best hookah spots in Las Vegas for YEARS! I came here the other night and it was all good vibes and good times! The manager here is awesome! I wish I remembered her name but I had too many drinks! Yikes! Anyways once we arrived, we were seated right away. I love that they always have such friendly staff working and the music is always good! The fact that they are more than reasonable in price makes it that much better! I use to come here a lot before I moved out of Las Vegas and it's still the same! I will have to make more of an effort to get down here whenever I would like to chill and smoke some hookah! They are just located a tad bit far from me though. I will return for sure though!"}
{"text":"Me and a few friends came to Azusa for food drinks and hookah.  We had Great service and food.  Everyone was very accommodating and I will be back more often"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious, the music is amazing and the waitresses have the absolute best attitude, they're sooooo sweet!!! The service was great they were so patient with us, and very attentive throughout the whole visit. I'm in love with the vibe here, I'm definitely coming back everytime I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've never tried the food that everyone seems to rave about, but the hookah and the service was terrible. First of all, it is very expensive. To add to the expense, you are required to buy a drink which is nonsense to me. My group of 8 friends had to split their bill by only two separate checks and there's even a smoking fee of $5 if more than 2 people smoke on one hookah. The hookah wasn't that great in my opinion, we ordered 3 different kinds and none of them were memorable. You can barely taste it and most of the time it was harsh. When we went it wasn't that busy yet they only changed the coal for us two times (we had to ask for the coal for one of the times!) and it was harsh most of the time. I got really nauseated after (but that is probably my own fault for smoking when I was getting hungry) and it was almost so bad that I couldn't eat.  I have no idea why it has more stars that 1. It's definitely not a place to go as a group. I could see that it would be nice as a couple thing, but I would still recommend The View. I do not believe this is the best hookah lounge in town, it is far from it. It may be Vegas but you can definately find cheaper places like The View, Cloud Nine, Rhumbar....  I wish I could have give less than one star"}
{"text":"The location is near the Hard Rock Casino about a mile away from the Strip. The menu and method of ordering is somewhat complicated. For example our group of four people had to have two hookahs because one has to order a hookah for every two people at Azuza.   The place has a vibe that defies its locale in a strip mall. It's lit darkly and has a very relaxed vibe to it. The hookahs were strong and were well prepared. I would consider walking from Nashville to Las Vegas to get some of the  delicious Peach tea.      After a day on the Strip: collecting cards advertising local ladies,getting lapdances from Chloe and Destiny, picking winners and busting up blackjack tables, Azuza is a nice place to conclude a victorious evening in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Cool laid back spot for good hookah. The staff is great and very accommodating. Their Hookahs are fairly priced and they have a good selection to choose from. They also have food and drinks on their menu. We like to come here to unwind after a night of partying, or to pregame before heading out on the night."}
{"text":"We love coming here. Food is awesome. Staff is great. We come here often and they remember us everytime. Even if it's a bit of time in between visits.  Love bringing out friends here too"}
{"text":"I thought their old location was the best in town. Now being over 21 and checking out this spot my mind has been changed. The music, decor, vibes, quality of product, and service are all top notch. I recommend coming into one of their private rooms to relax and appreciate the chill vibes. Again the service and hookah are great! I got a glass of wine and jasmine mint hookah and have enjoyed every minute. Plus the pricing for being so close to the strip is amazing. I highly recommend this spot!!"}
{"text":"My favorite hookah lounge by far.  Great people very attractive staff and reasonable prices"}
{"text":"always a relaxing time when we come here. Thank you so much to Eric for your attentive & fast service!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to smoke hookah and hang out. Very hospitable staff and food was also superb. Would come back again :)"}
{"text":"I don't smoke hookah, heck I don't smoke anything, constantly therefore I'm always very reluctant when I'm invited to a hookah lounge. But I was visiting a friend and they all decided to go, therefore I said WTH! When I arrived we were attended promptly, not bad. Our hookah was brought out to us fairly quick, good. And they were serving this peach tea, which was sooooo good, excellent! Totally made my night to find out that there were actual hookah/cafes that served GOOD teas. I'm sold. I will def visit this place again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I liked this place. Good music, good atmosphere, good choices!    We ordered drinks, they were fairly steep considering the quality of them. Overall it was ok, only because we had already been drinking so it seemed like a good decision.   I would have rated this place a 5 star except their service was pretty slow.   If I am back into town and in the mood, I'd go back!"}
{"text":"This is my first time to go to a hookah bar in las vegas. Very chill place... they don't have a live DJ which im used to but great food and amazing margarita. I love there unique hookah tables... its comfortable. They do close early for las vegas but the girl who is waitong on us is very friendly and staff is attentive. I would come back."}
{"text":"So far, the best hookah experience in Vegas. Great service. Great hookah. Great food. I now experience random pita and hummus cravings regularly. The Moroccan coffee is also an addiction. Both are new habits developed under this roof. That's a good thing."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place they play beautiful rnb music it's dimly lit the food and drinks are great the hookah is great and affordable and they treat me like a queen. They are very attentive to your needs and want to make sure you enjoy every single thing you order. If you go somewhere else over this place you will be sadly disappointment. Their drinks are done perfectly and the food is great and the hookah is amazing and a lot of flavors and I do mean ALOT"}
{"text":"Had friends in town our first time there... It's a great ambience for lovers in VIP room the food was good. I will be back to enjoy the fruit hookah.."}
{"text":"Honestly super chill. Awesome for locals. Came here after dinner to hangout. Everyone there was super helpful and probable. Will return thank you for making vegas a little bit better for the locals!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Very clean. Fast service.  Helpful. Let us bring in our own hookah was very polite about it. really like this place good food too."}
{"text":"Pretty flirty girls and tasty hookah.   A little more than use to spending but it is near the strip so expected.  I am here on a Wednesday at 11pm and it's pretty busy.  The servers all tend to the guest really well and are friendly. I didn't order any food but the menu looks pretty delicious. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Great hookah at a good price.  Chilled environment with good service.  The hostess is on point."}
{"text":"For a hookah lounge, the food was really good. We were a party of 12 people with different taste buds. Ordered hummus, coconut chicken, kababiq chicken, spicy fries with two Hookah. Drinks were pricey though. One shot of tequila was $14. If you are in vegas and what to chill out with some good food and hookah. This is the place for you."}
{"text":"Great Hookah spot. Definitely be back. The staff was extremely nice and the atmosphere had a great vibe. Music was awesome! Loved it"}
{"text":"I like Azuza because it has a great customer service , the menu has a variety of drinks,food and hookah. The atmosphere is relaxing and even romantic. The music is also good. I had a nice time in Azuza tonight ."}
{"text":"Staff is super helpful and friendly and they play great music. I ordered two hookahs in a way that would have cost more than if I had just ordered a refill, so the manager personally came over to explain to me how I could save some money if I ordered differently. Her hospitality made me of course order an additional dish and an additonal refill. Great vibe for a low key night off the strip - must visit. I smoke hookah all the time but their froot loops hookah is among the best I've had anywhere. Try that and banana kush, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best hookah in town! Lovely ladies serving you and great food and nice selection of tea. I never experienced bad service here."}
{"text":"Bad service, they have tables but wants you to sit in a VIP section which looks like a prison."}
{"text":"I loved the quality of hookah here! Very fresh and very flavorful! Their mint tea was amazing and the fries hit the spot, perfect snack food! They have an awesome house sauce - ask for it! Don't even bother with ketchup! The servers were very attentive and replenished the coal frequently. The only thing I didn't like about the place was that it was a bit too dark for me in there. But I tend to not like the dark anyway so maybe that's why. Would definitely go back here whenever I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing hookah! Perfect atmosphere. The hookah attendants were right on everything. We also went to another hookah place but came right back here every night for our Vegas vacation. The guy watching the coals was super nice and instructed us how to make the most out of our hookah at home. It was the first place we tried sarbuzz tobacco and am defiantly hooked. The only downside is I was used to my weaker smoke at home so the thick smoke made me a little sick. If you are a regular smoker it shouldn't be a issue. On more not they never make you feel rushed and never let the tobacco burn.We were their for 2 hours and the smoke never died down."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Best hookah we've been able to find since moving to Las Vegas. They have separate double apple hookahs, the staff is always friendly, and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"The BESTTTTTTT hookah I've found by far in Vegas! Rhumbar hookah sucks in Mirage and this place was the closest to the Strip. 7 mins away from me. It's a cool chill spot. Dim lighting inside. The hookah is the best. Just like the ones I smoke back in LA. Exceptional! We ordered the Grill Plate for two, hummus, and some fermented veggies. The food was beyond delicious. No refills on drinks so you would have to order seconds. They have a full bar I believe because they had a drink menu. Inside seating got full after we came in. You can also sit outside but the outside area isn't that big. They had AMAZING customer service. They were all so nice. They kept asking if everything was good and going well. I wish this place was inside a hotel on the strip. It would've been poppin which it deserves to be. Thank you!!! Hands down I'd give this place 100 stars but I can't."}
{"text":"I find myself coming to this establishment quite often, because the hookah, food, and drinks are really good.  They now serve alcohol, which makes the trip even more worth coming.  I particularly like the Peach Fuzz tea, because of the nectar inside.  My favorite Hookah is Fruit Loopz."}
{"text":"This place doesn't deserve even one star. I am here right now. First of all, we order alfaker double apple with mint and it came with full mint itself. We asked them to remake it and it took them 40 mins to make a new head. The store manager came up and said it is full capacity. WTF, if they can't handle the full capacity, why do they accept the customer until it gets full??? Good interior design doesn't make a good store. What kind of service they provide makes a good one. I don't recommend this place. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food amazing service and fun atmosphere. Great place to just chill with friends or even by yourself!!"}
{"text":"Awesome hookah and a very cool spot I went here over the weekend and was excited to have chosen a cool lounge versus a club I'm so tired of clubs but u still get that nightlife vibe here. The margarita was worth $15 it was done right very top shelf with fresh lime juice no artificial mix over here. I would surely frequent this place when in Vegas for business, I should have brought Some of my partners from China there they would have loved it.  Only thing i wish they had was some sort of seafood item fish shrimp whatever my fiancé is a pescatarian so he had to wait to find food  after we left which was like 2am.  We were hoping to have dinner there. Oh well."}
{"text":"Very friendly. Wonderful atmosphere. Tons of food for the price. Very courtesy   Would defintly go again. Beautiful"}
{"text":"Perfect place to chill and very clean.  Food was good, great music, hookah was delicious, and our waitress was always on point!! This will be our spot to visit in Vegas every time for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I have a habit of hitting up hookah lounges in different major cities. It's difficult to find a hookah lounge that doesn't make you run in the opposite direction. This place has to be the best one I have ever been to. Great service, great hookah, great drinks. The lounge is hip, quaint, and clean. They actually understand nobody wants to sit on disgusting cushions, eat off nasty tables, look at walls or ceilings falling apart, and deal with rude service. I highly recommend this lounge. It's not far from the Strip and it won't break the bank."}
{"text":"This is the best hookah place in Vegas. You even see NBA players in here. Can't beat it for hookah quality or atmosphere. Eric and the rest hook it up"}
{"text":"The hookah was perfect.  Great flavor , great pull  The price was a little ehh but it was worth it. The booths were comfy and the atmosphere was sexy as fuck . I would def recommend trying here while your in town ."}
{"text":"I'm a local and Azuza is one of my favorites. The hookah is consistently amazing and long lasting, the staff is always friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is really chill.   The food and drinks are pricey, but the food comes in rather large portions so it's worth it and if you're with friends you can share.   They have a pretty good selection of flavors and the price for a hookah is average.   I seriously love this this place! It's perfect to just chill by yourself or with friends  Eric, Libby and Daniel are the best!"}
{"text":"My favorite place no matter what I feel like doing be it relaxing or getting ready for a night out. Libby is always an amazing host."}
{"text":"This is the best hookah lounge I have been too! The food is delicious. The service is excellent. The staff is super friendly and on point! Even the drinks are amazing!"}
{"text":"Rayna and Eric were amazing!! Great food, lowkey, great place to gather with friends and smoke some hookah!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite hookah lounge until last night. Busy night with limited seating which is understandable. The host offered to seat us on the patio where we had the option between a table with dirty feet on top or one that was being imposed upon by the neighboring table. The host did not assist with making anyone move or offering to clean the foot table. We requested to be moved. Our request was declined. This was apart of our anniversary activities and I decided to leave and give the host my feedback. Terrible customer service! As I walked away she made snippy remarks so I replied in the same manner. Learn how to be empathetic and address customer concerns instead of being hostile. I will never step foot in this place again."}
{"text":"Awesome place , the staff is super friendly , \"Bink\" was very attentive to our table an makes a mean mojito! We will definitely makes this a must spot whenever in Vegas"}
{"text":"My sisters and I go here quite often with friends when we want to have good drinks with Hookah. The staff is great and they always make you feel welcomed. Their service is fast and the guys come around pretty often to change out your coals of your hookah without you having to ask. If you are looking for a good flavor for your hookah try the lemon mint by Samba, its the best. Also, their white peach sangria, lemon drop martinis, sliders and hummus are awesome. The setting of the lounge is low key and comfortable, they play really good mostly top 40. The music is loud enough for you to enjoy but not so loud where you can't have a conversation. The only problem I have is that they aren't that big so seating is limited but they make sure to let you know as soon as a table opens up."}
{"text":"Talk about heavy hand on my crown!  Great service and I would definitely go again! My only complaint is I couldn't use my Yelp coupon for a free flatbread and hummus because they said I had to print it out and bring it in..... however I got it anyways and was really good."}
{"text":"This is not your typical hookah lounge. Upscale hookah and dinning. Went for dinner and drinks. The atmosphere was chill and entertaining. the food was excellent and Libby was on top of everything. This is a great place to start or end the night."}
{"text":"Great hookah lounge!!! Amazing music, try the white peach flavor hookah quite delightful!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome the hookah is great the atmosphere is relaxing with a buddaest  style environment. Deffenitly coming back with my buddies. I recommend the flower tea it blossoms in a matter of seconds."}
{"text":"I'm not really one to partake in hookah (it just doesn't do it for me) but this place is fantastic! We went here with a small group for my boyfriends birthday and everything was wonderful from start to finish. We had many people helping us, dropping off food and drinks, switching out the coals on the hookah, with all of our service needs being managed by delightful Libby.   We ordered the son of a peach hookah, normal style, non of the fancy add ons and it lasted us a couple hours. It had a nice flavor and very reasonably priced at $20.  For food we ordered chicken skewers, hummus plate, the sliders (AMAZING sliders, must have); for drink everything from hot tea, flavored iced tea, to some jameson and gingerbeers and everything was great! The cocktails are very heavy on their pours and that is always a good thing :)  As I stated before I'm not a fan of hookah, but I definitely can't wait to go back to Azuza just to hang out and have some food and drinks, it's that good!"}
{"text":"Great service! The people here check up often to make sure everything is okay. I have been to several hookah lounges in Arizona, but the vibe and customer service here is awesome!"}
{"text":"This was my first hookah experience!  But since I'm more about food, let me start there!  Chicks on your grill ... grilled chicken and rice.  A little bland, especially after eating the Cry Baby Curry!  OMG this was so delish!! In fact, we came here twice while in Vegas and I ordered it both times.  The hummus and pita ... again, delish!  The first time here we had some sort of mint hookah.  It was good but after a while, gave me a stomach ache.  LOL.  Next time I should eat before I smoke hookah.  The 2nd time we were here, we had double apple ... it was really good but again, got a stomach ache for just a short bit.  LOL.  What a sissy!"}
{"text":"Absolute excellent hookah lounge, Very chill! Great selections of music not to mention speakers do sound pretty good. Also the staff is Excellent love this place. Keep Up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Good vibes, the chicken pita was perfect, hookah flavor was good and the vibes is wonderful definitely a new regular. My bro Eric was the perfect host"}
{"text":"Came in with my girl friend Janice on a Thursday. GREAT SERVICE. Served by Dominic, Daniel, and Libby! Been to many lounges; this one is top notch. From a hookah lounge you want a friendly environment with fast service and efficiency- this place is all about it. Super friendly staff from the moment we walked in (thanks to REYNA). This lounge because of the staff and overall vibe is the one to be at! LOVE IT!!! Recommend 15/10 for locals and out of towners. EXCELLENT experience."}
{"text":"Best hookah in town and the food is great too. Nice relaxing atmosphere with good music selection. Definitely would recommend this spot to friends."}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday evening around 7 after having spent a few hours at the pool followed by a burger at Grind Burger.  Anyway, there were 2 or 3 other parties relaxing and smoking when my group of 4 arrived.  We were promptly greeted by the hostess/waitress and seated in the main lounge area (they also have some private rooms in the back).  I ordered Blue Mist for myself and the hubby and my friends ordered fruit loopz.  We all agreed the Blue Mist was way better--it's one of my favs anyway.  Before 8pm hookahs are $12.  The \"hookah guy\" was very attentive and came by frequently to check the coals.  The four of us sat and talked for about 2 hours, intermittently smoking and sipping our Fiji water ($4).  Mind you, these type of places don't serve water in a glass for free; you ask for water and you get a bottle.  This is my new favorite hookah lounge in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Eric was great. His attitude was always happy. He was excited to be our server . We really appreciate him."}
{"text":"You guys need to Learn How to Pack Bowls and You guys need to learn about hookahs and you guys need to know how to run a hookah lounge. Also Bad customer service. It's a nice Place but you guys don't know how to treat or run it right"}
{"text":"I like the Hookah here it hits good. They have a variety of flavors. The customer service is pretty good. Four stars because, last time I asked for a picture and he said I'll be right with u and didn't come back."}
{"text":"I always stop in here after I eat at Kaizen. This is a cool little hookah place across from the Hardrock Hotel on Paradise & Harmon. The guy the that changes the charcoals puts on a show. He swings the hot coals around and throws them around. I'm waiting for him to catch the place on fire.....just kidding. I haven't seen drop one yet."}
{"text":"Love this place, best Hookah bar I have ever been too hands down. Customer service was wonderful, Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best hookah place in town! Food is great hookah is geat service is great. Cant ask for more"}
{"text":"Best Hookah Ever! Food is good, prices are reasonable, n staff is always friendly. I do hookah often n this place is one of the best I've been to..I always go here when I visit Vegas. I love Azuza!"}
{"text":"First time here and I enjoyed it.  The music was chill and the service was good.  We ordered the humus appetizer and that was more than enough if you're not hungry and just want a snack.  Glad this place has liquor lol! The hookah was good and I like how the tables have built in hookah holders so you're not constantly freakin out if the hookah will fall over. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy place. The lamb chops are amazing! Will definitely comeback when I am in town"}
{"text":"Amazing service, amazing hookah, amazing drinks. The second we walked in, we were treated very well and felt at home. Hookahs hit very well and they were constantly changing the coals. Great place to go."}
{"text":"Was in vegas for the weekend and went to this hookah bar. Nice set up inside, nice vip area and was playing music. All the girls working there were very nice and talkative. Eric, the guy working there was a cool dude, told my friend and I some good clubs to go to. Cool dude. The hookah was good and so was there drinks. A bit pricey but I would come back again when I visit vegas."}
{"text":"Nothing more relaxing than mint tea and a hookah at AzuzA. Since I was introduced by a friend a month ago this has become a daily ritual of quiet relaxation to clear my mind.  No recommendation I can offer could ever do justice.  It is an experience that everyone must try for themselves."}
{"text":"The hookah lounge was actually nice and pretty tasty (pineapple bowl). Went with a big group of friends and the staff was very accommodating.   Here's my biggest concern. If you go here, please pay with cash, as I have experienced being double charged. I've been calling the place for days now during open and closed hours and to no avail, NO ONE answers the phone. I have emailed, left voice messages and no one has bothered to return a phone call. The mere fact that stuff like this happens and there's no concern for customer service in regards to transactions leads me to believe that something fraudulent is going on. So beware if you go and pay with cash only."}
{"text":"We have been to many hookah lounges, and this is by far our absolute favorite!!! The environment is awesome, and the staff is gorgeous and super friendly!!! Vanity, Libby and Reyna are the best!!!! If you want a cool place to relax and have a great meal, come to azuza hookah!! xoxoxo"}
{"text":"Excellent place if you are a hookah enthusiast!! Chris hooks it up with great exotic flavors! The owner is on point and truly appreciates his customers! Must check it out!!"}
{"text":"We got thw eat a pita and the meat was so goood!! Everything was perfect and the staff was awesome!!!!! Will definitely come again :)"}
{"text":"Would not expected the best service, food and hookah from a low key spot! Visiting and wanted something chilled and nice and would recommend this place for everyone who wants a low key chill spot! AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I came here a year ago. I liked it better last year, possibly because they had alcohol. This time that I went, they didn't have alcohol anymore. They said because it got too crazy, drunk ass people throwing up all over the place, broken hookahs. I completly understand why they removed the alcohol...  :(   But it was a good time overall."}
{"text":"Customer service gets negative 10 stars. Came with some girl friends and the girl looked us up and down and told us we had to wait for the guest list. The answer would of been fine without the attitude"}
{"text":"Azuza is one of my favorite hookah lounges. It's clean and in the UNLV/ off the strip area on Paradise. I used to come here all the time when I was in college.  The food here is freaking awesome! They have a small selection but everything is made to order and is fresh. Their hookahs are clean which is a plus because most hookah lounges have nasty hoses. They give you the hookah tips here, and the water is 100% clear inside the bowl. Their hookah flavor menu is freaking awesome as well. Theres about 100's of combinations of flavors so you can be your own mixologist.  The drinks here are really good too. Cheap and strong lol. I ask for my signature jack & coke and they always put like 2-3 shots in my drink! Thanks guys ;)  The service is a hit or miss. Sometimes the hookah girls get too into flirting with the customers that they forget to check on other tables but its fine because I'm a pretty patient person. Clean, upscale hookah lounge with VIP areas, cheap drinks, and good hookah. B+ 4/5 !"}
{"text":"Great chill spot.  Nice eye candy.  Awesome hookah/shisha selection"}
{"text":"We love this hookah lounge! Each time we come to Vegas it's a must visit. The staff is awesome! Libby is very personable and equally greets and communicates with all patrons. Our first time trying Mediterranean food was here a couple years ago. I have to recommend the pita \"sandwich\" which comes with a choice of meat and deliciously seasoned fries. The sisha selection is great. I like that ice is added to the base of the hookah at no additional cost. Over all the service, atmosphere, food, and hookah are 5 star. Did I fail to mention the drinks are just right! (By that I mean strong )"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Vegas for a little getaway and we were craving Middle Eastern food and hookah. We found Azuza on yelp and decided to give it a try. I'm so glad we did! The food was absolutely delicious! I had the chicken kabob, veggies, rice and tabbouleh...so so good!! At the end we shared the baklava ice cream...OMG was it delicious!! It was hard to share with the hubby, let me tell ya! Their peach and orange mint hookah flavor was also great! Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"We just happened to pull the door open a bit after hours and the the owner and some of his friends were there finishing up their night and invited us in, for a few puffs.   the atmosphere was very very chill, a bit dark. but it was after hours.  Tobacco flavor they were smoking was some kind of apple, very good.  the workers and the friends her had there did not make us feel like we were intruding.   i will definitely be paying you guys a visit, next time i'm in vegas.  Even just to say thanks for your hospitality."}
{"text":"Great spot with great atmosphere. The staff was amazing they were soooo helpful and friendly. They kept checking on us and making sure everything was good. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Very nice & Lounge-ish venue.  FANTASTIC service. Libby, Daniel & Joseph treat you like family. Great music.  Very DELICIOUS food!  Recommendations:  1. Lamb Chops are AMAZING! They are as good if not better than any place you've tried in Vegas. 2. Egyptian sliders. 3. Kofta ASADA Fries. 4. Coconut Satay (Chicken) 5. Hummus  Everything we tried was so delicious that I can only imagine everything else on the menu is just as good :)"}
{"text":"Love love love the vibe and the Manager Libby is awesome and great at customer service. I went to a different hookah bar just because Azuza wasn't open yet and the service was terrible we immediately left as soon as Azuza opened up and went there just for the great customer service of Libby and the place is great at maintaining the coals"}
{"text":"When the girls and I need a gossip session over some hookah and good eats you can bet your last dollar we come here! Oh and we always take advantage of our free refill on our hookah with our Yelp check in!!!  The first few visits we usually came here after dinner or late night which prevented us from ordering from their food menu. Well until last night hunger came across us and we nibbled on their sharing is caring entree! Geez we had been missing out!!! So now we get our grub on, our hookah on, the girls get their casual drink on and we're surrounded by the right amount of chill vibes to play catch up with. In reference to the service, well sometimes they get busy aka forgetful and well we have to ask a couple times for refills but hey we're not all perfect. They still get the 5 stars and the alpha female that runs this joint always takes great care of us! The one thing I love most is the consistency!!! It's always good or great here. Although it's near by the tourists this is the perfect spot to get your night started or perhaps end it here. There's nothing but good vibes."}
{"text":"Probablemznt la meilleure chicha de Las vegas. Ambiance tamisée et bien frequenté. Nous n'avons vu aucun drogué .  Les plats sont halal et abordable.   Vous aurez un vaste de choix de gout pour votre chicha. Pensez à prendre un verre de thé fait maison, sinon ca n'est pas une chicha."}
{"text":"Awesome place if you just want to kick back and chill! Staff is cool and laid back and well attentive definitely coming back to hang out :)"}
{"text":"I've going here for 2 years since I turned 21. A lot of hookah places are disappointing, but not this one! The employees are so accommodating and the best always making sure we are having a great time. I don't mind the wait to be honest; they are definitely worth the wait, hookah is awesome! Just everything. I could be in Jammies (which is very often) and their chill about it. Private rooms are so  nice and boxed literally the definition of privacy."}
{"text":"Service was awesome. Very low key environment. Decoration was really cool. The food was AMAZING, though a bit spicier than I anticipated! My husband and I wanted to have a quieter night than what we have experienced in the last week and this was perfect. They replaced the coals 3 times and we never even had to ask. The staff was very friendly and even suggested a different flavor when we ordered because he said since we go to hookah lounges at home, he knew we may not appreciate the flavor we chose. Overall I will definitely come back when I get back to Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"What a great lounge! I always walked past it after tanning but I finally went in last night and it's so cool inside! It's a smaller lounge but very nicely decorated and the music isn't too loud. The servers are super friendly and hospitable, it was one of my friends first time smoking and she was patient enough to teach him. They have happy hour from open to 8pm and they also have private rooms. I'll definitely go back and try the food!"}
{"text":"Really nice chill back lounge. Very private and inexpensive. Good place for locals and tourist."}
{"text":"I've tried this place 4-5 times again because it's the closest one to the strip. The lady at entry (I think owner) is amazing. She has helped us each time we came, and even when we didn't like the hookah, she'd change it. My plate of food fell on the ground, and even though it was after the kitchen closed, they came me another plate and cleaned up the spill.   Second time trying food, pretty good. Got the kebob and the hummus. It's amazing as well. The drinks: Moroccan tea FTW!"}
{"text":"This place has unanimously won the best hookah place in Vegas in my book. I've visited almost ALL local hookah lounges/restaurants in the valley and I've come to the easy conclusion that Azuza Hookah Lounge & Cafe is the best there is.  Here is why:  1) HOOKAH: Everything they do leading up to making a good hookah bowl is pretty standard and similar to most places, however, the ice-filled bases are a HUGE plus in terms of smoothness. The employee knowledge on the different types of hookah smoking is impressive and informative. They are excellent with their ability to match/mix flavors to your liking. They are understanding when you're not satisfied and will not hesitate to please your hookah taste buds (at least in many of my experiences). SEVERAL of the bowls I've had there last long (beyond two hours). Of course that can change with the frequency of your smoking. The hookahs and hoses are all a high quality and clean (fancy too).  2) FOOD/DRINKS: The food is excellent. All organic and fresh. You can't find another hookah lounge with food at these prices that taste like this. The drinks are eclectic (non-alcoholic). None of them disappoint. Anything from hot tea to iced juices are awesome.  3) EMPLOYEES: The employees are respectful, knowledgeable, and friendly. I treat the employees with respect and they return with respect as well. They handle any issue you have with food or hookah willingly, respectfully, and swiftly. It can get busy at times and service can take longer at times, but that's how it gets sometimes. They know the menu and are excellent with recommendations. They have uniforms that allow customers to distinct who is an employee and who isn't (some places don't do that).  4) AMBIANCE: Good clean space. It's a lounge so when I see people complain about \"table space\" I would suggest going to a restaurant. I make due with the space at hand. The music ranges from electric, dub-step, hip hop, and reggae. They mix it up often. I LOVE when they play reggae there. The music isn't played at an ear-piercing volume consistently (like other hookah places).   5) PRICE: Reasonable & fair. The regular price for hookah is the similar to all the hookah places in the Valley but there is a happy hour for hookah from 5-8PM. I go there during that time often. The food is worth the money and so are the drinks.  I have my own hookahs at home (several of them) but when I want to wind down from a hard day work, I choose no other place than Azuza Hookah Lounge & Cafe. It's an awesome hookah place with culture, good food, good drinks, and friendly employees. I follow then on twitter and facebook for any specials they may have.  Thank you Azuza."}
{"text":"This place definitely stands up to the positive reviews. I don't understand why it has less than a 5 star rating with some folks.   As a consultant/road worrier I'm always on the move. In a different city/state/country at any given time. Being in Vegas for the night, I had many MANY mind blowing options. I can't even begin to tell you how grateful I am that I happened to pick this place for my \"one night in Vegas.\"  Eff \"the strip,\" this is where it's at.   The staff is INCREDIBLE! Libby, I'm assuming the owner/manager/leader of the pack, is just as amazing as her looks. She's drop dead gorgeous but her attentiveness and her customer service skills outshine her beauty. IN A GOOD WAY! Actually, maybe they're on the same level. Yeah, Now that I think about it, she's just as hot as her customer service and attentiveness. She's one with the people, yo! TRUST.   She stopped by often to make sure I had all I needed. I came here alone. Wah wah wah. Don't cry for me, Argentina, it's a part of the loan wolf/road worrier life style. But even with as busy as this place was, she was on point with her attentiveness. It makes you feel welcomed! And want to stay as long as possible!  Next, the food! Holy moly, jesus, write home about it NOW!! If the service is anything to rave about, the food matches the same! Good god, the hummus was on point! The flavour, the texture, the right amount of spice! I'm drooling just writing about it! Also, major points for having authentic tea and not the lame teabags most places serve. I drank the whole pot. By. My. Self. Don't judge.   And the sheesha/hookah! Let's not even go there. I tried the \"chix mix\" per Libby's recommendation. Lemme tell you, Willis, not only is the lady gorgeous and warm and welcoming, but she also knows her stuff!! MAJOR MAJOR points. MAJOR. I told her the flavours I'm used to smoking. And she gave me an amazing recommendation. It went strong for over three hours. Yes, I was there for ages, and yes it was amazing. And yes, you should definitely be jealous! But why be jealous when you can come check this gem of a place out for your self!  Now, the music, no matter what your type, you'll love it here. Trust me. As an avid music lover, (along with my foodaddiction and taste for alcohol!) I was swaying to every beat that came on. By my self. Don't hate.   Well Relaxed. Well Fed. Well Entertained. And, WELL TAKEN CARE OF!!!! What more could you POSSIBLY want?! So, stop reading the other unappreciated reviews and just come check this place out for your self! You're not gonna be disappointed. And if you happen to be amongst the few that miraculously don't like it, something's wrong with you. Not them!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to hangout n relax a vegas evening ! Food n hookah are amazingly awesome  Try white -gummy lemon mint- and  -kivi orange n mint- 10 on 10 to these guys for service"}
{"text":"Great hookah amazing customer service my favorite hookah bar in Las Vegas definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Libby was an amazing hostess she was quick and on demand. If you ever come here try and find her, such a sweetheart."}
{"text":"I've been to alot of hookah lounges and this one is great. They have a variety of flavors including some Starbuzz. They have alcohol which is nice haha. The service is awesome and the people are really friendly. They even ice their vases. The seating is a little cramped but it's still comfortable, I recommend it."}
{"text":"I visited this place almost two years ago initially, and then I recently went back about 1 month ago. Great atmosphere, good music and a good selection of flavors to pick from. The drinks there are amazing, they are strong on the liquor, so if you are really looking for a buzz, this is your place to go."}
{"text":"Hookah enthusiast here in town for a couple of days, so of course I had to find somewhere great that had somewhere to smoke. I visited during the early afternoon hours on a Sunday and the place was empty which was fine with me. The vibe and decor of the place is relaxed and chill, perfect for smoking with a couple of friends. The hookah flavors were awesome, a lot to choose from and they tasted great. The service was just as good as the hookah itself, the two gentlemen that helped us were attentive, especially when it came to switching out our coals every 10 minutes which I definitely appreciated - not all hookah spots are this attentive and kind. The restroom was also very clean which I noticed too. Overall this was an excellent spot to visit - I'm sure at night it gets super busy and I can definitely imagine why, Azuza is a great spot."}
{"text":"I've become a regular here since the staff is ultra friendly and attentive.  Hookahs here seem to last a lifetime with unlimited coal replacement on each bowl of tobacco.  Food menu is quite good for a hookah lounge and the drinks are like any bar in town.  Drinks may be a bit pricey for a lounge but the hookah pricing is reasonable and makes up for it.  Great local spot that also attracts the tourists.  Love seeing occasional celebrities hanging back and smoking some hookah here!"}
{"text":"From the time you walk in and are greeted and seated the ambiance and vibe at Azuza is phenomenal. Customer service, quality and environment. Nice spot off of the strip and worth it."}
{"text":"If ur looking for a great place to hookah late night during the week, this is definitely a place I highly recommend. Hookah is great, atmosphere sets a cool ambiance, food is unique n tasty n the service is amazing!"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place in all hookah lounges in San Francisco had to check it out.Best hookah in Vegas great service friendly and organized.love how the hookahs have a dedicated secure spot in every table indoor and outdoor. And drinks are very affordable, not like other lounges in Vegas (high way robbery. Always come here when I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"This place was cool good food and nice environment and the tables are awesome just wait and see!"}
{"text":"I had a hookah loving friend come into town for a visit, so I was tasked with finding a nice hookah spot (that of course served alcohol). Azuza came up on my search list, and the reviews were good, so I bookmarked it.  We got there around 5:45pm on a Thursday night and were the only customers at the time. Our service was great. Only bad part was the kitchen wasn't in operation that night, for reasons unknown. Shisha was nice, with many options of flavors. With Yelp you get a free refill upon check-in.  Drinks were nice and strong, they use a nice variety of quality liquors. My drinks featured Stoli Elite....which is delicious.   Again, our service was excellent. I wish I could remember the girl's name who helped us, but she was friendly, helpful, and the guys were always there to keep the coals hot. As it got busier, more staff was on hand and everything was nice and chill. A few TV's on the walls to keep you up to date on sports.   Decor is dark, with several Buddha's covering the walls. Seating is comfortable. It was nice and chill, great for conversation. Thank you Azuza....you have a new fan!"}
{"text":"Came to Vegas on my weekend with a friend was my First time ever doing hookah this place is the best coals always replaced without having to ask. Libby was our server ask for her !!! Great scenery and even better service. Thanks Libby !!!"}
{"text":"Best hookah lounge in Vegas, HANDS DOWN! The shipshape is tasteful and smooth, never had a harsh hit yet. The staff is super chill and friendly! They make sure you're taken care of and are always walking around to cater to anything you may need. Their menu has very exquisite choices, you'll never make a wrong choice. All-in-all, when you come here you'll make it a weekly spot to come by and chill with your crew or even kick it solo!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!  The hookah, food and service here deserves 10 stars.  Libby the manager and Alejandro the server are SO sweet and make this place so much more enjoyable! I look forward to coming here every chance I get.  If you're looking for GOOD hookah, food, service and ambience, you cant go wrong with Azuza."}
{"text":"Amazing hookah, amazing service, great atmosphere. Highly recommend this place to anybody. Manager is on top of things and makes you feel really welcome. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The Staff Was Amazing!!!! The Food Was Even More Amazing!!! Great Hookah!!! I Love This Placeeeee!!! Will come over and over!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a good place for anybody 21 & over. Staff was nice & checked on us frequently. Music was great. Downfalls was that I didn't like the fact if someone bought a drink, everyone had to buy a drink. Which I thought was kind of lame especially if you didn't want to drink any thing. I didn't get a chance to try the food. Only smoked hookah & the flavor was a watermelon kind, really yummy."}
{"text":"one of the best places for a hookah i've been to. clean establishment, friendly service. hookahs are served with ice water in the base, providing a nicer experience. the coals are routinely changed out -- correctly with the filters blown out between.  some minor items i did not enjoy -- - table space is tight in some areas with tables butting up against your shins - pricing is overly complicated and ridiculous - cost is fairly expensive after the inclusion of a \"one drink minimum per person\""}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere over priced to the max .....many neighboring places with a better vibe and better prices . Not recommended"}
{"text":"Coming from the Bay Area into Vegas we wanted a legit sheesha spot and we found it here. If you want a place with awesome sheesha and a fabulous manager, amazing setup, and great crowd this is it. Libby is off the hook, super sweet, very personable and knowledgeable of the sheesha biz. One of the staff wasn't the friendliest but don't let her ruin it for you, cause seriously the tables are so well constructed holding the sheesha in place and more so the owner, David made the tables custom. Come check this spot out, you won't regret it. Signing off - MNM"}
{"text":"I've been to Azuza on a couple of occasions and have to say I'm a fan. They offer a fun atmosphere at decent prices as well as a full bar and kitchen menu.  We have made visits almost exclusively on Saturday evenings and they can get busy but are never too packed where we don't enjoy our visit. Service is attentive and they change out coals and check on each table regularly."}
{"text":"This is my ALL TIME favorite hookah spot. The food and service is always amazing. Eric always gives amazing service and with a smile. The staff is awesome and very attentive."}
