{"text":"This restaurant was formally Krebs Restaurant, but the location was bought and renovated by new owners.

The interior of this restaurant is beautiful. Huge comfortable booths with big high backs. Contemporary spacious decor. We counted 3 separate seating areas, 2 of which are atriums.

We visited during lunch and for the most part had a great experience. Serving sizes are perfect for lunch and for the price.

I had the Hot Turkey Sandwich, an open faced stack of turkey served on a half kaiser with a baked potato, and vegetable (broccoli, cauliflower and parsnips).

My wife had one of the specials, Prime Rib on a Hoaggie, with fried peppers and onions. Served with a side of french fries (which were tasty).

The reason why it was a great experience for the \"most part\", the prime rib wasn't trimmed, and had plenty of fat still attached. My wife had to open the sandwich and remove it with her hands."}
{"text":"Comfortable ambiance, friendly service, exquisite food, and reasonably priced. 

A true \"gastro pub\", this place hosts a mouth-watering menu with a great selection of delicious dishes. A tough choice, I ended up having the bacon-wrapped scallop (perfectly cooked, on a bed of caramelized onions & bacon), porchetta grilled cheese, lamb shank (melted off the bone), and a couple of their desserts, all well priced and made with a noticeable attention to detail - compliments were most certainly sent to the chefs. A very good selection of drinks is available as well, including a couple of house brews (the seasonal I tried is done very well). 

The space is just as comfortable for after work drinks or watching the game from the bar as it is for celebrating special occasions (I was there for a sister's birthday - group of 15). Most patrons were 'business casual', but it's still a relaxed, casual atmosphere. Having gotten there at 8 PM on a Saturday, I shouldn't have been surprised by how full it was. The service was understandably slow (and could use a cue from the kitchen when it comes to attention to detail), but that should be expected during the rush on an especially warm Saturday in January. I would still say the service was good all the same."}
{"text":"Went to The Brock House for the first time with a group of 18, we sat In the bar area. Love the atmosphere and look of this restaurant, dark and romantic, but not too dark, wood panel ceiling, brick walls. 
Service was great, thank you Brandon...a few mix ups but were quickly taken care of. 
As for the food, most of us ordered the prime rib, which was nice, however most of our dishes came out cold and the Yorkshire puddings were filled with horseradish, cold horseradish. The beef tenderloin was absolutely delicious and all dishes were nicely presented. 
All in all I would return and check out some different items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food with a menu that changes to keep things fresh. One best places in durham. Well decorated and friendly staff. Never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I go to many many different restaurants for our date nights, and The Brock House has been one of our favourites so far! We were greeted at the door by one of the owners (Russ) and sat immediately. Our server Maddie was such a great server we were absolutely blown away! Hayley and I both ordered pizza and even though they were quite large, we didn't leave much to be taken home!

I will absolutely be going back to The Brock House! A++"}
{"text":"After reading the few reviews that had been posted here, my wife and I decided to give The Brock House a try for lunch - best decision we've made all month.

My wife had the Sheppard's Pie and despite having already read that it was huge, we were both still surprised at the size of it.  It was so big my wife could only finish half of it.  Made with angus beef and cheddar mashed potatoes, it was one of the best Sheppard's Pie's we've had.

I had the daily sandwich special, which was an open-faced prime rib sandwich with swiss cheese and chipotle aioli, served with sea-salt chips (which seemed like they were made in-house, but I forgot to ask).  The serving wasn't as huge as the Sheppard's Pie, but more than enough and very tasty.

My only disappointment was that I was looking forward to having an Orange and Maple Creme Brule for desert, but after ordering was informed that it had been changed to Strawberry and Vanilla Creme Brule.  I did appreciate that our waitress was considerate enough to come out advise me of the change in the desert and to see if I still wanted it.

While there are some more expensive items on them menu, our meals (plus two drinks and coffee) only came out to $32 before tip, which I thought was a great price for the meal we'd just had.

My wife and I spent the rest of the afternoon discussing our experience at the Brock House and will definitely be going back again... and again... and again..."}
{"text":"Were do I start, poor service, poor management, lack of ingredients.  We were in on a Tuesday night and there may have been 5 tables occupied. 20 minutes to order drinks 10 more minutes to let us know that they couldnt make a Blueberry Tea because the bar was missing an ingredient. and 10 more minutes to get our drinks. One of us ordered a pasta dish which came with a jerk sauce, sounded great. the spice was ridiculous,  I love spicy food and I would have had an issue with it. When we called our waitress over we got a lecture about Jerk spice and attitude. This was a birthday meal that I wont forget. This is a hospitality industry and they just dont get it. Dont waste your money here there are some great resteraunts in Durham that would love to show you what hospitality really is."}
{"text":"My daughter, 3 year old grand daughter and myself went the last week for Whitbylicious 2017. We went there for lunch. We both had the $25 beef sandwich and salad with fries. The food was mediocre, to say the least my grand daughter had the spaghetti with meat balls. The meat in the sandwich was tough and meh! The pasta I can do better..lol!  Daughter had cider and me a 6oz wine $12. 
For the $100. Waste of $$  

Ambiance is nice not spectacular or anything."}
{"text":"I went there with my family last night for dinner.  I has a little apprehensive at first going here with 3 younger kids but then I realized it was the stigma of the old establishment that was there previously (Krebs) that was still kicking in.  I have to admit I was rather impressed overall with this place, the food for the most part was quite delicious!  We started off with an order of the Mini yorkies which were small yorkshire puddings stuffed with cheese mashed potatoes and covered in shaved prime rib and gravy and served with horseradish on the side.  It was very good on the whole, the prime rib was cooked perfectly.  The only drawback was that the yorkshire puddings were a little on the chewy side.  For dinner I ordered the 12oz Ribeye steak, I was a bit sceptical when I saw the $32 price tag but I will admit, these guys know how to cook a steak.  This might have been the best steak I've had for awhile (I'm looking at you Keg)!  The steak was cooked perfectly and the veg that came with it were great as well.  I do wish however that there was more pizazz with the baked potato, perhaps some chives or bacon on top?  One of my favourite things of the night and my kids agreed too was the Funnel fries for dessert!  Think funnel cake only cooked in fry like sticks with a jam sauce and whipped cream to dip them in!  They were pretty fantastic I must admit.  Overall a nice atmosphere and good dining experience!  I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"this is our fav. place to have a nice family time . great food, good ambience, clean place. i would def. be back with my family."}
{"text":"Where to start.
Probably by advising you to save your money.
This is not a steak house...or anything above a shoeless Joe's type restaurant.
The most amazing head scratching part of my Brock House experience is seeing all of the positive reviews. 

Double date with a combined bill of 250...if we went to McDonalds we would have been more satisfied.

Let's get the good out of the way.
The building and location are above average. 
The patio is nice....would be great if the fly problem could be controlled.  Sure your outside....but the amount of flies tells me the garbage area needs a good cleaning (speculation - not seen).
The building and patio I would give a 4/5.

Now the restaurant business that the building is filled with...ouch...1/5 is hard earned.

Ceasars for the table. 7.50 a drink and it was less appealing then the Motts canned version.  Would have been happier if I did receive a canned Motts over what we did get. 
A gin drink was also ordered...was good.
Drinks 2/5.  That gin drink made all the difference.

2 apps ordered for the table.
Calamari and a cheese and meat spread.
Calamari was good.  They have the tenticle and the tube pieces with a side sauce.  Serving size was adiquate and sauce was different but good.
The meat and cheese spread was a fancier version of a childs lunch able snack pack.
Soggy brittle, kraft spiced cheese / cheddar cheese slices, cream cheese, prepackaged deli meats, a sweet jelly, a powerful grainy mustard, olives and 8 servings of crusty crackers drizzled with a balsamic reduction.... (I believe). I nvr toured the kitchen but I know my food...and that's what we ate.
Serving size was great for 4 people to pick at.
Apps cost to quality is where this is a fail.
2.5/5.

For the mains our tables order was:
lobster linguini
16 Oz prime rib
10 Oz prime rib
Fish and chips

Lobster pasta came in around 23 a plate.  Serving size good.
Was bland.  Very heavy cream sauce and generic. Looked good. Had some lobster.  Made my female bloated and ill as the night progressed.
1/5 hard earned.  No food should make one ill or bloated without over eating.

Fish and chips.
Hard to screw this up...fish and chips can be made and sold from a van on the side of a highway.  
The fish and chips here was on par with that level of quality. 
3/5....I expected more.

Now for the GRAAAAAND attraction.
The BEEF!  
Sadly there was no grand attraction here.
Ordered a 16 and a 10 Oz both med rare.  Mine with all the fixings.
Good cuts.  NOT a massive chunk of fat with little meat.
Both sent back twice because they were well done.  No pink, no blood.  The crust on the outside was...not a crust. More like a sprinkle and lite lite sear. The fixings were under done (grilled for color but not carmalized) The jus was waaaay heavy on the oily side.  As in you could visibly see the depth of oil before the jus.  Jus was tasty.
Mashed potatoes good.  Seasonal veg...small serving...was decent. Yorkshire pudding was stuffed with horseradish...so who's gonna enjoy that. Neat idea...but give your clients one not stuffed to eat.
Presentation was nice but difficult.  All of this is layered. Making your feeding experience a project of deconstruction with a chance of mess.
1/5. I only ended up eating one or two veg...a mouth full of mash and 4 Oz (ish) of prime rib...combined from the 2 attempts at medium rare.
The other person that ordered the 10 Oz ate less then myself.
I, like my female....became bloated and sick as the night progressed. 

Service.
Was decent. Seemed almost inconvenienced by having patrons. Server tried to explain that prime rib well done is prime rib med rare.  I myself have ran 3 restaurant kitchens, farmed, butchered and have a YouTube cooking channel.  The explanation was a bad attempt at recovering some dignity for the kitchen.  However, our server did scratch the 16 Oz from the bill....not the 10oz though.
3/5 for the service....just because I'm looking for a ray of light here.

Over all.
This is not a steak house. 
This is not good bang for your buck.
Aside from the company and building, not an enjoyable dining experience.
Sad to say...take your money to the Keg in Ajax.

Whitby deserves a better Brock House."}
{"text":"I was invited for dinner at The Brock House so never bothered to check the ratings. After the fact, prior reviews are pretty accurate. On arrival, the overall decor is old world elegance but upon seating, the furniture is pretty worn and dented. The service was the high point of the evening with quick and friendly attention. The food can be summed up as average and over priced. We started with the charcuterie board and Buffalo Cauliflower which was a promising opening. I had the Lamb Shank which was solidly average. We also tried the ribs which was awful. The ribs were accompanied by pulled pork on baked beans which were quite good. We returned the ribs and took more pulled pork but this apparently did not rate a visit from management or a recognition on the bill. Others enjoyed the short ribs and a variety of the pasta dishes. The fries in truffle oil were a big hit. Overall, I cannot recommend especially at the price point."}
{"text":"Went to this place hoping for a great meal and thanking god Krebs had been replaced with  Shrimp Cocktail meets Hot Rocks, this was supposed to be a great night out... Not so, sadly
The service was average, It wasn't a busy night. (owner at the bar eating his meal, bartender aparently seeking more shifts) didnt leave the bar to take our drink order, finally after 10mins he yelled over... not a great start but we were hopeful for a better finish... not to be had, long story short, service was extremely poor as was the cold food.
Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I have been here two times and all of those times I have had a great meal at this place.  Admittedly, it is in the burbs but the food and service feels downtown.  I concur with Sara's reviews.  The appetizers were seriously flashy and delicious.  How cunning to put shrimp in cucumber cups.  Tasty and a feast for the eyes.  Everything was delicious.  I had the lamb chops which were excellently cooked, without the gaminess.  For dessert, we had an amazing house special cake, which was filled with chocolate cake and mousse and other not so good for you things.  I just remember it was there then in a few bites gone like Keyser Sose!  

If I ever find my way in these parts this will be my go to place.  I am happy that this place exists and so well-established that it will probably be here for the next decade.  Great food and service.  Please don't be a chain.  Stay as good as you are Brock."}
{"text":"We really like The Brock House.  We always start with the Yorkshire Puddings which come bursting with flavour thanks to the beautiful made mashed potato and roast beef.  The staff are always friendly and attentive and are good at making suggestions and helping to make slight changes to the items to accommodate preferences.  We usually sure a shepherds pie given how big the portion is, usually with either pasta or a salad. All the food here is high quality for a great price.  Definitely try this place if you're in the area and looking for a relaxed gastro-pub like atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the service was very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere made it a well rounded dinner experience.  We are definitely going back."}
{"text":"I generally get prime rib or pizza when I come here. And every time I have an excellent meal. They have a great beer and wine selection. My only complaint is it is very loud. Not sure how that can be fixed just always feel like I have to yell across the table"}
{"text":"Good experience! As a student, my funds are tight and I knew that eating here was gonna break the bank. That being said, everything was a bit overpriced, however the food was still good. The lobster tacos in the appetizer were good, however a little greasy and only 3 small tacos were given. I ordered the fish and chips for the entree, and the size+texture of the fish was great. The quantity of the fries was a little low, but it was sufficient. Overall it was a good experience, but be prepared to empty your wallet."}
{"text":"Been here three times now and have always loved the food and the service. Atmosphere/dining room is relaxed and comfortable with lots of space. A little pricey but worth it in my opinion. Would definitely recommend for a first date destination! Will definitely be returning again in the future. For appetizers I highly recommend the Charcuterie Board if you're feeling adventurous!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Brock House over the past few years a handful of times, usually for dinner talks, but other times for celebrations with coworkers. 

Last week I went back to the restaurant for a work dinner talk. There was some appetizers on the table when I arrived and they were bruschetta - it was kind of cold, but delicious.

afterwards we had 3 courses for order. I chose to have the salad, 10oz prime rib and the dessert was a default for everyone - waffles with chocolate semifreddo.

The salad was good, it wasn't anything special about it - basically just some tossed greens in a vingarette dressing. some of the other people ordered the soup, but I noticed most of them did not finish it, so perhaps it wasn't anything pariticularly special. 

The prime rib, i have to say, was quite good. The meat was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and for 10oz, it is a big piece of meat. It came with some mashed potatoes and vegetables. the mashed potatoes were good, quite flavourful, the veggies were alright. I liked that they were not overcooked. as for the prime rib, I definitely enjoyed it a lot. I coudl only eat half of it though, but they were able to pack it for me along with my mashed potatoes. The only thing is the crust (outside) edge of the prime rib was obviously where the flavouring was heaviest, so I didn't really like that part at all and I ddin't eat it because when i tried mixing with the meat it was still too salty for my liking - overpowered the flavour of the beef.

the dessert was quite good. the waffles were okay, but I found them to be a bit on the hard side (they weren't that soft and fresh). the chocolate semi-freddo was delicious, though for my personal preference it was a bit on the sweet side, but nonetheless, this chocolate semifreddo SW was a nice way to end the evening on :)"}
{"text":"Overall, the experience was okay but not great.  I am not sure I will be back.  And in reflection, I doubt it.  There was nothing about the experience that made me want to go back.  

The crap cakes (from the speciality menu) were the shiny light in the meal.  The nutty flavour from the greens complimented the crab in an unexpected way and the aioli was creamy and packed some serious heat.  

The presentation for the chicken and waffles was creative.  While the chicken had a flavourful batter, it was extremely dry.  Each element on the plate when eaten in isolation of the other elements was lacklustre.  And the chicken gravy, what to say.  While it was warm, it was globby and hard to pour.  It reminded my of cold gravy that sat on the kitchen counter for hours after a Thanksgiving dinner.  

The steak had a wonderful char, but the plate overall wasn't anything to write home about.  The mash potatoes were supposed to be a smokey cheesy mash.  I am challenged to say I tasted any hint of smokey cheese.  Essentially, a standard steak plate.  

Service was direct and to the point and lacked any element of consultation.  When I requested details on two dishes I was pondering on, I received a recap on the ingredients as stated on menu versus any level of perspective that could help me inform my decision.  Overall, I left full but not satisfied."}
{"text":"Rounding up to a four. This is a nice place with plenty of parking out in Whitby. Friendly, helpful service and good with allergies. I wouldn't make the drive just to go to this place, but appreciate it as a nice mid-way place to meet up with my parents for a meal.

The mood lighting was a bit strange at 1130AM, but otherwise I quite like the atmosphere here. It's a big house with lots of rooms and windows. Today we sat by the fireplace.

Today most items were enjoyed. Nice to have a choice of side from fries to salad to soup. We had:
Cheese pizza
Beef dip
Chicken Club
Salad with grilled chicken
Grilled cheese - loaded with grilled vegetables, arugula and goat cheese!"}
{"text":"Had a booking for a birthday. Arrived everything ready and prefect.  Food and staff were amazing and 100 % better than expected.  Thanks for making this party easy and comfortable for all who attended."}
{"text":"We went out for Father's Day brunch this morning and for the price of the buffet we felt the food variety provided was good. 

The waitress we had was also excellent and checked on us frequently and was on top of refilling our drinks and chatting with our daughter and interacting with all of us. 5 stars to her.

The reason why the review isn't 5 stars overall has to do with the manager of the restaurant. Madison. I had made the reservation a month in advance and specifically spoken to someone on the phone about having a table to accommodate a high chair and assumed all will be well. We showed up as a family of 3 and myself being 37 weeks pregnant and was told that the booth doesn't accommodate a high chair and that she didn't have anything else available for us. This was incredibly upsetting as I had finalized these details on the phone with someone and given that it's Father's Day and a very busy day we had nowhere else to go. She tried to tell us to put my very small child in a booster seat without straps meant for a much older child to which we simply responded that we did not feel comfortable with since she could slide out or get hurt. Instead of sympathizing with us and trying to resolve the issue. The told us that we can at least try. And when my husband said he was uncomfortable as our child could get injured and our meal wouldn't be enjoyable. Her response was \"In that case. I want you to leave. \" we are shocked and had to ask her to repeat herself. To which she replied \"Yes. I want you all to get out !\" And walked away. We were so deeply insulted. Hurt and upset and humiliated. Eventually after my husband had to go and approach her she told us she had another table for us available and I don't understand why this wasn't offered to us in the first place. We had to swallow our pride and bite our tongues and eat there because by now we had been there for 30 minutes and had a very hungry screaming toddler on our hands. Because of this horrible experience we will never be dining there again. 

Update. After speaking to the owner of the restaurant. Russ, he couldn't have cared less about our experience and told me that he didn't even feel I deserved a call back because we deserved the way we were treated by Madison and he doesn't want us there again since we provoked his staff to behave that way. And the way she acted was warranted."}
{"text":"Came here for New Years Eve 2016 and it was amazing!

It was a murder mystery along with a 5 course dinner menu. The murder mystery show was entertaining, but the food just blew me away. Everything was delicious.

Also the staff was amazing!! Great service with great attitudes. I felt like the staff really enjoy their jobs. 

The price wasn`t cheap. It came out to be $130 each for the night, but it did include a new years celebration with dancing and all. 

Not something to do every year, but worth it to check it out once."}
{"text":"I have been back twice since my original rave review and have had mixed feelings, hence I am dropping them down a bit for now to 3 stars.

Where they have real highs on the menu they have had some real lows ( Like their Ribs that were were the worst ever and now off the menu). 

Last time we were here I had the the Seafood Paella but found it had no layers of flavour and tasted like one muddled mess of paprika and whatever sausage they had used for as a base on top of rice that was borderline hard.

Now on the high notes the Fresh pickeral filet my wife had was AMAZING and I would go back just to have that.

after this..All of us had  apple crumble for dessert and it had a terrific topping but barely cooked apples under it...WTF?

Consistancy is the issue here and it leaves me really struggling as I really like the place and they just need to stop screwing up the odd thing as much of what they do is brilliant."}
{"text":"I love The Brock House. It is the perfect place to go for a family birthday party. They have options for all ages. My favourite thing to order is the mini Yorkshire puddings. The atmosphere of the restaurant is great. There are tables in many different rooms so it is never too loud. The only thing I didn't like was the chicken and waffles. The waffles were garlic infused and that just tasted wrong. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to go out for a tasty steak dinner, but wanted to avoid the big price tag of The Keg. He had been here a few years ago and the reviews on Yelp were quite good so we made a reservation. Brock House is located just south of Rossland on Brock Street.

We arrived on time for our 5:30 reservation and were shown to a booth near the bar. Being early on a very snowy Saturday, the restaurant was pretty quiet, with many of the servers lingering by one end of the bar waiting for tables.

I ended up going for the Flank Steak with warm potato salad and seasonal veggies and my boyfriend got the other steak on the menu. I also ordered the warm olives to start and we got an order of bruschetta as an appetizer.

The warm olives were intriguing and good, but ultimately far too salty. I enjoy warm seasoned olives but I tired of these quickly. Perhaps if they had been served as part of a dish, like with some bread, good olive oil, something... wouldn't order again. The bruschetta was quite good, good sized portions and tasty. Nothing I haven't had before though, nothing special about it.

I had very high hopes for my steak and I was a bit surprised to find it already cut up on the plate when served and covered in the mushroom jus. While the steak was tender, there was nothing to write home about here. I was disappointed that the steak wasn't the star on the plate - although nothing was. The warm potato salad was just odd. Fingerling potatoes sliced in half and very very sparsely coated with the potato salad style sauce, which wasn't very good either. The beans on my plate were far too undercooked and really didn't do much to add to the dish.

The service here was polite but curt. I felt like our server didn't really want our table (which I can't figure out because we didnt do any special orders or speak rudely to her or anything) and she wasn't attentive at all. My boyfriend didn't like her attitude either.

Overall, super disappointed with what was supposed to be a great restaurant. Perhaps it was an off night, but don't let all the great reviews fool you. There's nothing stand out about this place or its food. I won't be back."}
{"text":"A friend and I came here for their Sunday brunch buffet. One of the best breakfast buffets ever, which comes to around $20 after tax. Good value and high quality items. 

They have an omelette bar where they can make you an omelette, and a customized mini pizza section with interesting toppings like roasted red peppers, asiago, smoked cheddar, smoked chicken, arugula, asparagus and artichoke (among more normal things).

Mini waffles that are fluffy and can be topped with chocolate or raspberry sauce and whip cream. Lots of standard breakfast items (home fries, sausage, scrambled eggs).

Their desserts were yummy too. Raspberry jello (which was actually good even though I don't like jello), rich chocolate brownie, delicious carrot cake, fruit and even a chocolate fountain.

I'm impressed that there is actually a good breakfast place in Whitby. Good value for what you get.

Service was friendly, and the guy making our stuff was very careful, meticulously placing everything just right on the pizza (which is a nice attention to detail you don't find many places).

I've been to a few places for brunch in Whitby and Pickering and so far out of the ones I've tried I like this one most."}
{"text":"I would typically drive by this place quite often and notice the many cars and thought \"wow\" this place must be amazing.

Recently got together with some friends for a dinner event and this is my experience.

Decor(5/5)

Very tasteful, it kinda has a Keg vibe but more laid back. Some really cozy booths and the overall ambiance was great. 

Service (4/5)

The service was good and our server was very pleasant and usually quite attentive. The water at the table wasn't filled up as requested, and towards the end of the evening she seemed kinda rushed to get us to pay. Other than that overall it was great.

Food (2/5)

Not sure if it was an off night for this place, but I ordered the veal chop 12oz. It was horrible. If felt like this chop was frozen, reheated, and put in the grill. The inside was tough! Very disappointing, especially for $36 dollars. My wife had the salmon it was better, but overall this place is pricey!

Overall it's a nice place. Try it out for yourself, I personally will not be going back again. The food is just okay, and at those prices it has to be much much better."}
{"text":"It's a rare occasion to find me in Whitby, as nearing Durham tends to make me break-out in a rash.  Having said that I was pleasantly surprised by a recent visit to the Brock House.

 I came here for a casual birthday celebration dinner and have to say that Brock House's excellent selection of starters had my mouth watering with tapas-tastically delicious anticipation.  Mini Grilled Chicken Tacos, Mini Yorkies and  Blackened Jumbo Shrimp are just a small sampling of the oh-so extensive appy-centric menu that whet our appetites and set our palates reeling in ecstasy. The Mini Yorkies which are yorkshire pudding cups filled with smoked cheddar mash, shaved prime rib, mushrooms, beef gravy were devoured with gusto as I hear a chorus of ooohs and ahhhs from my carnivorous companions of how decadently it tastes. 

 I (gluttonously ) order the Mini Grilled Chicken Tacos and my personal favorite of our selection is the Blackened Jumbo Shrimp.  Served-up in fresh cucumber shot glasses filled with tomato gazpacho, accompanied by house-made mango salsa the shrimps are tender and piquantly seasoned and the novelty of chasing them with a chug of the zesty gazpacho shots makes this possibly the best appetizer I've experienced in a very long time.

For dessert we ordered a flourless chocolate cake that looked almost volcanic and conversely it erupted with much choctacularity, outstanding!!!!
  
In a land of the usual wasteland boring big box eateries and yawn-fests of fast food joints, The Brock House stands out triumphantly, while impressing  with it's gastronomic charms. If you're in the east 905 try to check out The Brock house, 
IT'S TAPAS-TASTIC"}
{"text":"Came in from Chicago. We went there for Valentines dinner.  Made reservations weeks in advance but was seated by the bar at a bar table.  Finally persuaded the hostess to sit us at a table instead.  Our original waitress responded with our original request with a 'Oh well, next time you'll know\".  Food was average. Lamb shank was small.  Steak was good,  Appeared they were rationing the veggies.  I would recommend the Bruschetta though. Deserts were good but portions small."}
{"text":"Went to The Brock House yesterday night for a birthday dinner (mine) and had an awesome time. First off, I love the vibe of the place. Stone work, wooden bars, very classy cocktail-centric sort of feeling. Started off with the charcuterie board, which, if you've seen any of my reviews, you'd know that I love charcuterie. However, while 90% of this board was fantastic I thought the ham was lacklustre and the Genoa salami wasn't the best meat choice. Prosciutto was fantastic, all the cheeses were wonderful and the spicy mustard was intense. It also came with a nut brittle that really ended off the plate nicely. Then, I had my main of chicken and waffles. Chicken and waffles is probably my favourite dish. I think they balance each other extremely well, even though they don't really make sense together. They just work. However, while the waffles were amazing, the chicken gravy was fantastic AND the slaw was on point, the chicken was slightly dry. Not enough to ruin the meal, but enough that I noticed. I also tried a bite of my girlfriends pulled chicken pizza and it wasn't very good. Finally, they brought me a flourless chocolate torte for dessert and it was wonderful. Defendant and delicious. Cannot say anymore than that.

I'd like to come over on a day I'm not nursing a hangover, and try some cocktails, because their drink menu was intriguing. 4/5 stars, for simple, fixable mistakes, that may have just been caused by an off day. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"I've driven by this restaurant so many times and have always wanted to try it out. I finally decided to rally up some friends and give it a try! Our party of 5 arrived at 7:30pm on a Thursday night. We were greeted by the friendly host who led us to a table in the back corner of the restaurant beside a stone fireplace. The restaurant had a very warm and cozy ambiance with maple flooring and cathedral wood ceilings you'd think I was at a ski chalet.

Our waiter that evening whom was also very friendly came over to introduce himself and explain the specials for the night. On Thursdays every order of the Brock House Famous prime rib comes with a complimentary 5oz glass of the feature red or white wine. As if the Famous part wasn't enough to get us to order it, the free glass of wine truly sealed the dish!

I went with the white wine which was a delicious dry and crisp pinot grigio.

For appetizers I decided to try the Warm Pretzel which is house made and comes served with a beer cheese dip.
The pretzel definitely had that homemade feel with it's chewy salty exterior encasing a warm fluffy soft centre. The cheese dip served cool had a mild beer flavour with more of creamy cheese base which surprised me as I would have preferred a cheddar based dip however that's just personal preference.

For my main I went the 8 oz cut of the Famous Prime rib which comes served with your choice of potato, natural jus, seasonal vegetables, and a mini Yorkshire cup stuffed with fresh horseradish.
The meat was cooked to a perfect medium rare and was incredibly juicy and tender with peppery seasoning and a nicely salted crust. The rich and dark au jus was perfect for drenching my meat in especially with a light coating of the homemade hot horseradish. I only wish they didn't fill the yorkshire pudding with horseradish because it soaked up all the pungent and spicy horseradish liquid and turned the buttery crust all soggy. The seasonal veg was a wonderful assortment of sliced yellow and orange carrots, green beans, and perfectly cooked broccolini. For my potato I upgraded to the lobster mash and I definitely recommend it! Creamy red skinned mashed potatoes with hints of garlic and sour cream with ample chunks of buttery lobster meat was the highlight on the plate. 

As if I wasn't stuffed from the huge plate of food who am I to resist indulging in some dessert. As soon as I glanced over the dessert menu I knew I had to have it.

The Brock Bomb - Five layer chocolate cake, hazelnut crunch centre, and chocolate ganache
The mountainous cake was a true chocolate lover's delight! FIVE layers of a deep rich chocolate cake sandwiching a decant chocolate filling spewith crunchy hazelnuts pieces draped in warm chocolate ganache was to die for!! There was also a drizzling of raspberry sauce on the plate which I adored and was the perfect pairing to cut through all that rich chocolate decadence.

Overall I have to say it was a pretty great meal, service was good, and the ambiance was perfect. After paying our bill we continued chatting away for almost an hour and never once felt rushed or the need to leave. Plus that chocolate cake alone would make anyone drive all the way down here any day!"}
