{"text":"This store has changed owners a couple of times, and the new owners are very friendly. The store is clean and the produce is fresh. They have a variety of ethnic products, as well as some deli products. There are halal meats available such as chicken, lamb, and beef. You can also buy fresh made sandwiches and hummus as well as desserts.  As we were checking out the owner gave us a whole bag of pita bread for free because they were closing soon and didn't want the bread to stay overnight. I would highly recommend this store."}
{"text":"I think this place is called Sultan Foods   Nice store with a good selection of spices, produce, fresh meat, sauces, teas, rice, cookies, sweets, frozen foods and other Middle Eastern groceries. They also sell phone cards and hookah.   They also sell shawarma sandwiches that are very tasty! Each wrap is $5 and is very filling. (My husband and I split one)   The workers are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My family loves going to the Middle Eastern Market! We get fresh hummus, amazing pita chips, and whatever else were feeling that day. Walking inside, first you'll encounter a couple of aisles with different types of authentic middle eastern food (grocery store style). Then the back has a small deli where you can order food to go. The prices are fair and the service is great, we go about twice a week and I would recommend trying it to anyone!"}
