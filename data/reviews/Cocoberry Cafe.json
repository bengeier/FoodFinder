{"text":"Very disappointing! I went their twice and food and service are horrible. I ordered egg and steak. The steak was tasteless and overcooked. The service was very slow and waiter was not happy with 15% tip for very bad service!!!"}
{"text":"One of a few early morning breakfast places in the Harbour front district. 

Small place with a nice selection of items. I popped in alittle after 7am and had a few people in the place already. 

There was only one person working as server/cook and he was a bang up job keeping up. 

I ordered 2 eggs, bacon,  toast, potatoes and coffee. Eggs were perfectly done to my taste, bacon was crisp and not pre cooked. The potatoes were warm and spiced a little to spicy for my taste. 

Overall, for a quick, fresh breakfast and inexpensive place I think you'll do well."}
{"text":"I came here last week during a stay at the Westin over Caribana weekend. There are very limited seats and it took about 15 minutes to get seated. Once we were seated, the server took another 15 to 29 minutes before she took our order (including coffee and tea) . My friend had to get up and grab utensils and condiments for the table.
The couple next to up kept asking for coffee and decided to leave after about 15 minutes of asking.
I got the Cocoberry Platter with 3 eggs sausage, bacon and toast. I asked for an omelette and was given one with no cheese.  My friend ordered the Cocoberry Waffle and her waffle was hard and cold. She had to request another one.

Overall the service was horrible and the food was pretty bland. I would recommend going elsewhere if you are extremely hungry and looking for a quick meal"}
{"text":"We enjoyed tasty eggs benebagel and salmon Benedict breakfasts. Priced right, adequate service (took a while for coffee refill and it wasn't busy).  Right next to the hotel we were at so it was also convenient."}
{"text":"Loved it! Great food! Better than being at a touristy crowded hotel for breakfast! The waitress was nice. They even have mimosas!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it, though my dad did not. But he doesn't really pick good things off the menu, so that doesn't count. I got the waffles with ice cream. SO GOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for breakfast on a Sunday at 9. The place was half full already, so I can imagine it being quite busy closer to noon. The ambiance was a cross between your local diner and a cafe. The tables were pretty small, but I don't blame them given their tight space. We all ordered the bagel Benedict (has smoked salmon and comes with fruits and homefries). For $10, the portion was pretty decent and the taste was standard. The only thing that put me off about the place was the unfriendly waitress. She did not acknowledge us when we walked through the door, nor did she rush to get us menus. Overall, for the price paid, it was not a bad breakfast."}
{"text":"Wanted to give my review from a person who has worked for this owner. It has been a few years but if the owner is still a Guyanese Man then this is still relevant to anyone who wants to work for this man.

He will offer to pay you cash on an hourly basis but hold back 4 weeks worth of work and what your job description is to clean the washrooms, busing tables, make the caffeinated drinks (lattes, teas, coffees, etc), handle take out orders, and serving 26+ tables on your own. Might I add, if it gets busy, then you might have to help out with any deserts orders. 

I was extremely over worked and my customers saw this, I would be hustling up and down the restaurant and since I was working for Tips, every single table was at risk for tips since I was spread out too thin. To top it off, I had to share my tips with everyone and the funny thing is, that everyone is just 1 person which is the owner himself. The way the tips are split is a percentage of my entire dollar amount that is swiped through my card. What I found unfair is that if I happen to take care of all the take out orders, it would be a percentage of those orders as well even though there were no tips (I never expected any take out clients to tip me since there was no service being offered)

If you are someone who wants to work for this owner, beware, he will try to cheat you and if you manage to let him hold 4 weeks pay over your head, he will leverage that to get what he wants from you."}
{"text":"This is a greasy spoon near the waterfront. Good food and reasonably priced. 4 ate breakfast for $50. Service was good."}
{"text":"It's a pretty small, cool coffee shop-type place. Ordered an iced cappachino and the cocoberry brunch. Food took about 15 minutes to arrive. Iced cap was pretty good. I had my eggs poached for the first time and they were decent. The sausages/bacon were good and the potatoes/toast were decent. Nothing really special about this place, just has a nice relaxed vibe. 

Few of my friends thought their food wasn't very good. They ranked it 2/5. I gave it a 3"}
{"text":"Just started working in the building across the street so I have been on the hunt for a decent breakfast spot that isn't Tim Horton's.   
I was warned about this place by a coworker who lives nearby but i thought, how can you screw up a simple breakfast. 

Myself and another colleague strode in about 8:30 on a Wednesday.  We both ordered 2 eggs, bacon, toast and hashbrowns, mine scrambled and his over medium. 

The eggs were about the best part of the meal though scrambled eggs were very dry. The over medium eggs were cooked just right so there's that. 

It all went downhill from there. The bacon...What should be the pinnacle of the breakfast experience was a dried out crumbling mess. 
I'm also not sure how many strips come with it because it was all in pieces. It was like he just tossed it in the deep fryer and just left it there till someone ordered it. 

The toast...although it would have to have been toasted in order to call that. 
White toast with butter came out as white bread with butter that was warmed up to the point where it may have been toasted if you had just stuck it through the conveyor belt one more time. 

The potatoes...old.   How do you serve old dried out potatoes at 8:30 in the morning? 
And way over seasoned with pepper. I like pepper as much as the next guy but this was like blackened potatoes with all the pepper, and so dry.  
My throat actually hurts a little from swallowing them.  

Take my advice, skip Cocoberry for breakfast.  
There is a little Chinese owned Deli down the street that does an all day breakfast; it's by the Tim's.  
Tried them the other day.   Bang on! (but skip the hashbrown). 

Thanks Cocoberry for showing the world what not to do. 

I walk away with an empty feeling for the bacon that was so tragically wasted :("}
{"text":"They were out of chicken, they were out of bread, and I found a dead tick in with the lettuce. Worth avoiding."}
{"text":"Late in posting this, but we visited Labor Day weekend. There was a guy working the register who was running around waiting on tables by himself. After maybe 20 minutes of this, a girl walked in almost dream-like (she seemed a bit... airy?) and started waiting on tables so the guy could actually seat people and ring people up. The cook was delivering food to tables and owner was cleaning up tables- during the morning rush, apparently they all do double duty except the girl. The wait was ridiculous, but the Benedict was decent."}
{"text":"This place was all right--an easy walk from our hotel, and way less expensive than the hotel restaurant, so I award at least two convenience tourist points. 

I agree with Angela L. that the eggs benedict were overcooked--mine were just a little more jelly-like than usual, but SK's were almost totally hard!  SK liked the seasoning on the potatoes, but it didn't do much for me.  Latte was OK. 

It was very crowded so service to our table was a bit slow, but we couldn't resent it, because our server was totally running her tail off--clearly doing the best she could.  There were only two servers (who were also hosting), one person bussing tables,  and what seemed to be just one guy cooking--and the place was PACKED. 

 We had a window seat, which was nice, but on the other side of us (a bit too close for comfort) was the cart where all the dirty dishes and other garbage were being piled up.  I get that it's a tiny joint, at that there needs to be a convenient place to dump stuff and wheel it all back to the kitchen at once....but I feel like that spot should not be....next to a customer's table. 

It got us what we needed--hot food in our bellies for a chilly day of wandering the city.  But probably wouldn't go back, or really recommend to others, unless we could guarantee it wouldn't be so mobbed.  With a little more time and attention, or staff spread a little less thin, I think it could be a nice little spot."}
{"text":"Came to this caf√© on a Wednesday morning. Was very quiet yet the server didn't hover. He quickly offered me coffee or tea and promptly came back to take my order. Good was great and well presented at an affordable price. Will come back during my stay at the harbor front."}
{"text":"Decent meal, good prices, especially given the surrounding high end area of hotels and Queens Quay."}
{"text":"My friends and I just felt like exploring the harbour front on a quiet week day and just ended up at this cafe. Since it was past lunch hour during the middle of the week, it was pretty quiet at the restaurant, so we got the complete attention of the waiter, who was very polite and helpful. 

I ordered the Quesadilla in California style (with avocado and bacon), and was surprised to see that it wasn't completely filled with cheese like most quesadillas I order! I wasn't sure whether this was a good thing at first, since I love melted cheese, but then I realized that most restaurants fill it with cheese so they can skimp on other ingredients. Cocoberry however was VERY generous with the chicken, salsa, and the bacon. So in the end I saw the lack of cheese as a positive. However I did wish that they gave me larger chunks of avocado. The avocado were so finely diced (making it turn into mush) that I had a hard time distinguishing it from the salsa (I even thought they may have forgotten it!). 

One of my regrets however was ordering the banana split. The picture in the menu looks gigantic, and since the items that my friends ordered looked like the picture in the menu, I figured the banana split would be true to the picture too! I was wrong =(. There were only 2 sad scoops of ice cream (you do get to choose tho), one halved banana, whipped cream and strawberries. There wasn't even any fudge sauce =(. And for over $6 I felt kind of ripped off to have such a tiny thing arrive at my table. If you want to get desert there, maybe try the crepe, since it's only $4-$5, and the savoury crepes my friends ordered seemed pretty good so I'm guessing the fruit one should be ok too.

Overall this restaurant was average, but the waiter was very nice and accommodating. Since we were paying the bill three ways, it took us some time to pay the bill but the waiter was very patient and even offered us change to help us break our bills!"}
{"text":"How is this place still in business?
I've eaten here a couple of times now and each time I wonder out loud as I leave, \"Why did I go back there?!\" My stomach screams at me and I spend the rest of my day regretting my decision to give this place another chance.

The most recent visit my husband and I decided to get a quick breakfast and  purposefully order dishes that are difficult to screw up. Eggs, toast bacon and coffee.

Eggs had shells in them, bacon was super soggy (despite asking for crisp), toast was burnt on one side and they didn't have butter. Coffee was horrible and even though we didn't want any, we were never offered any top ups.

It's my own fault for continuing to go back and continually being disappointed."}
{"text":"Service: Adequate

Atmosphere: Nice

Food: Bland

Would return? No

Popped into this place when visiting some friends in Toronto as it was right down the street from their building. Seemed like a nice little place by the waterfront with some presentable decor.

The four of us were offered any table we wanted and were given menus, with orders taken soon after. I decided on the spinach, goat cheese, and tomato omelette, which came with some brown toast. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time, but a couple of our drinks needing topping off. The waitress left right away so no one had time to ask. I waited to see if she would come back or if we could grab her attention, but she only came back once the plates needed to be cleared.

Unfortunately the omelet as fairly bland and... watery? Ya not greasy; just watery. When I cut into it water came out. Not a lot it was just strange to see; I've never seen that before. Moving on: the most tasteful thing in the omelet was the spinach, which left much to be desired. The toast was fine; butter on bread.

On the walk back I asked the others and the consensus was the same: just not good food. One had potatoes that were overdone, another the potatoes were under-cooked, the back bacon was shaved, and no seasoning on any eggs.

So ya all in all not a good experience. I would have given it a higher rating since the food was not bad, but for the price point it loses some credit."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning and service was terrible.  The place was fairly full, so very understandable it took a while to get seated for 4.  However we basically had to find out own table as there was only one waitress on staff.  Could not fathom why there are not more people on staff on a Sunday morning in the summer when all the families are planning to head to Center island.   Our table was never cleaned and it wasn't until we went up to the cash register to order did the waitress tell us she would take our order.  Of course this took another 15 minutes as we had to wait for her to come back.

Food is basic breakfast fair so don't expect anything special.  Even for bread, there is only white and brown.

I would not recommend coming here unless you are in a desperate need.  You are probably better off going to Aromas across the street..."}
{"text":"Wow.  Truly an experience. They were out of everything. They advertised a lot of specialty coffies, and had only a plain cup of coffee.  Milkshakes we no.  Malts were no. No beef in the place for any dish, only chicken.  Husband gave up on beers an asked what they DO have. It's like they were working from an entirely different menu than what they handed us."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with the family.  We wanted something quick and inexpensive.  That's what we got.  It's a no frills place.  We all got bagels (no choice on them ) which were ok.  Bacon was good.  Orange juice was bottled and just generic.  The service was fine.

Overall, for a quick bite without breaking the bank, it's fine.  Just don't have high expectations."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 0 stars. Probably should report to health department also. My take-out coffee had a nickel in the bottom of the cup, which I only discovered after I had finished most of the coffee. Totally grossed me out.

Before the nickel incident, I was somewhat of a regular, and grudgingly would accept their horrible and slow service on a morning that I could afford to wait for a cooked breakfast.

They were continually understaffed, often with only one individual serving as cashier, waitress, and sometimes even cook so I heard from her.

I really hope that with the new development in the neighborhood, this place will get replaced with something more reputable in the near future."}
{"text":"Their menu is quite large and the food is pretty good, but the service here is terrible. I think mostly because they are always understaffed. There is always this one waitress that is getting yelled at my customers. I feel really bad for her because she is the only one working at the front. Between taking orders, getting refills, and settling bills, she also has to hear assholes yell at her. I've stopped coming here mostly because the out-of-towners are expect triple A service after their 5-hour drive into the city."}
{"text":"Writing this review pretty late, but my friends and I came here on our last day in Toronto for Caribana weekend and our experience here was pretty okay. There were only two waitresses, a bus boy, and a cook; and during the time we came was prime breakfast time. So clearly it was busy. But we didn't wait long for seating and our waitress was on top of everything. The other waitress seemed like she was new and probably in her late teens/early twenties, so our waitress kind of had to pick up the slack for her. 

My friends and I all ordered the Cocoberry platter which was really good, aside from the greasiness of the sausage which was a slight turn off for me, but I still cleaned off my plate. We all got drinks because why not? I had the tequila sunrise which was very weak and was missing the grenadine. So kind of disappointed there. 

Overall, my friends and I had no real complaints"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. I came here with my two friends to get breakfast. We didn't even try the food and I can say I will never come back. The server basically told us to leave because \"apparently \" there is no space for table for three people. I generally, don't mind giving this place another try since it was busy. But after the attitude we received from the server; I will not come back!"}
{"text":"We happened upon this small cafe while attending a conference at the Westin Harbour Castle. It is in easy walking distance and I wish I'd known about it from the first day. Prices are very affordable and the food was great. The owner was cooking and running the show that day. Very polite.
Worth navigating the construction ridiculousness, especially if you're in a Harbour area hotel."}
{"text":"We were downtown for a conference and staying at the Westin Harbour Castle. I wasn't looking forward to paying the outrageous prices at the hotel restaurants so I hopped onto Yelp.

There isn't much in the area for breakfast but I found Cocoberry and although it had unfavourable reviews, we decided to give it a shot. How wrong can bacon and eggs go?

We both ordered bacon and eggs (mine sunny side up, his over easy) and everything was cooked perfectly. We didn't have any issues at all with either the food or the service and I was happy to save a few quid by coming here. 

It's a small, diner style, restaurant with good food at a fair price. I'm glad we didn't let the previous reviews scare us away and if the conference is in the same hotel next year, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great little place!!

Came here on a recommendation from a nearby hotel in Foursquare (it said: the hotel restaurant is pricy for breakfast, try Cocoberry). I only wish I'd tried it sooner!!

The piping-hot bacon and sausages were delicious and the fried eggs (which I'm not usually a huge fan of) were perfectly done! How often does that happen? Not often.

The tea is bagged but their black tea is quite good.

It's not very impressive and I had my doubts, but it is awesome. Also great value!! Breakfast was $10!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it was an off day or if this place is truly awful, but my entire experience at this establishment was terrible. I came with a group of 4 people and from the time we walked in to the time we walk out our service was horrible. First we waited 15 minutes to be seated. Partially because there weren't any seats, but also because the table was left dirty for about 10 mins. 

Second once we were seated we were not brought water or cutlery for 20 minutes. There were two waitresses on staff two cooks and a bus boy. So I understand things get busy but waiting twenty minutes to get water is crazy. The waitress took our drink and food order and after waiting about 8 minutes for our drinks - coffee and tea  I got up and asked the bus boy.  I also got the table sugar and cream since it was never brought to our table .

Having been a waitress before I am aware that brunch is a busy time but the staff clearly had no sense of urgency of efficiency. Food was brought be fore beverages. Condiments were not placed on table prior to food coming out. Water wasn't given right away. Our waitress didn't even ask how our food was. 

Lastly when we went to pay at the counter, our waitress didn't remember us and asked if we needed a table!!! After being there for about an hour our waitress did not remember that we already ate..SMH!! never AGAIN"}
{"text":"I came in here and the waitress asked if I would sit in the back of the restaurant. I said great and told the waitress I would like a coffee and a menu. The waitress told me she would be right with me... 

It wasn't very full, maybe five people in here. I should have left at that point but I was hungry and thought why not, it was also close to my destination... So I sat in the back and waited two minutes... Then five minutes... No waitress! I checked my emails and waited a couple more minutes. Still no waitress. I got up and looked for her. The cook saw me and rushed over to me with a water and a menu.

The food took only a few minutes and the cook gave it to me. The food was sparse but good, not great, just good, under seasoned, only a few home fries... Just OK for the price. 

The waitress handed me my bill after I got up from eating and told me to have a nice day... She didn't even bring my coffee or remember who I was! Bad service, get better wait staff and this place might get a second star... 

Meh"}
{"text":"Short walk from the Westin, glad to find this all-day breakfast cafe.  The price was quite good considering its location.  I ordered the Bagel Benedict (smoked salmon) but opted for English muffins instead.  The fresh fruits were plenty in varieties, the meal itself was satisfying.  The service was nice and speedy."}
{"text":"We really should've known better than to come back to Cocoberry Cafe. In fact, we did know better; we'd even been sharing stories of bad past experiences en route to the restaurant. \"There was the time when the server greeted us at the door with 'I'm swamped right now. It's gonna be a really really long wait' when it didn't even look that busy\" But we for geographical reasons ended up there anyway.

As per what looks to be usual, it wasn't all that busy on the brunching hour of our visit. The menu is that of a typical greasy spoon. We ordered eggs benedict ($9.95) almost all round, which might have caused a strain on their hollandaise reserves, cuz I've never seen such sadly dressed eggs in all my bennyin' days. The extra sauce which our server obligingly brought a little side of had to be rationed between three of us. The eggs that were supposed to be poached were cooked entirely through and more closely resembled a failed hard boil attempt than anything that should be crowned with the golden sauce. The home fries, although unboringly (and unnecessarily?) fried with tomato sauce and onions, must've also been on a shortage. Not one of us could count more than four miniature cubes on our plates.   

There were little complaints about the bacon and eggs and clubhouse sandwich though. Cocoberry also serves Nantucket Nectars juices, which is great. Although without so much as a smile, the service from the lone server was decent. The chairs and banquets are incredibly squishy, which may or may not be a good thing depending on the condition of your lower back. 

Considering the harbourfront location and general lack of competition, there's a lot of potential for Cocoberry's, but for now, that remains untapped."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why the harbour front doesn't have exceptional breakfast spots. With thousands of residents you would think it would have a killer breakfast spot.

Today I didn't feel like cooking breakfast or walking/driving up to another neighbourhood so I thought I would make an attempt to go saddle over to Coccoberry.

Well. I would say if you enjoy good food, comfortable environment with receptive service then this is not the place for you. There is nothing inspiring and at best the poached eggs were ok. I don't feel I have overly huge standards but this place in underwhelming on all fronts. Too bad though....location is terrific and should be a weekend money machine. Save your money and go queen east or west for breakfast!


If there any aspiring restaurant chefs looking to build a niche business in an underserved but growing neighbourhood let me know. I would be interested in participating in a business venture to bring some passion to the harbour front. 

Signed. Disappointed Saturday morning breakfast patron."}
{"text":"Breakfast was predicable in a good way. 2 egg Spinach omelet and coffee was reasonably priced and what you expect FOR the price. Something between Tim Hortons and a more expensive restaurant. Server was quick and polite. Place is clean. That's it."}
