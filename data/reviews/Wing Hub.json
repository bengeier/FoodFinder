{"text":"Poor service. Long wait times for wings. Even had a small feather and some hair still on a wing, thank goodness I noticed. Don't waste your time going here."}
{"text":"If it was possible to rate lower than a 1 star I would. Went to the restroom to wash hands after being seated... The most unclean facilities I've seen in a long time. Ordered food which then took about 35mins to be served. Note that there was only 3 other people at one table in the entire restaurant. When the food arrived... They didn't bring everything ordered, and my friends wrap was so old and crusty that when she picked it up, it disintegrated in her hands! They took back the wrap and brought her a new one (with the same fries, that are now cold). The new an improved \"chicken\" wrap had no chicken... And also had an additional ingredient, a nice black hair... We got up and left.  Will never eat here again, and encourage you to do the same."}
{"text":"Wings are great (fresh and tasty), so is the burger... but the beer tastes watered down. I had the Canadian on tap.  I think they've moved or closed down, though."}
{"text":"This place took over from a wild wing  franchise. Wing hub is almost an identical logo and they didn't bother to change the restaurant.  I think it's a mistake to have a similar branding as wild wing, because the quality of the food at wing hub is far superior.  I got the special of the day which included the large wings, which basically meant that you were getting the entire wing not separated.  I was questionable upon receiving the dish, but once I began eating I realized these were exceptional wings that were extremely fresh, had a crispy coating and a in house hot sauce."}
{"text":"Placed an order over the phone and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. 2 Hubbers and 2 Lbs of Wings. We get there in 20 minutes and had to wait another 20 minutes for them to get the order ready. It wasn't even packed with customers (which would be my reasoning as to why you would take so long for burgers and wings). Finally when the order comes out of the kitchen, no apology given just an explanation of how painstaking those hubbers were and that it took them so long to pack the sandwiches. Why have a menu item that you're not too fond of making or serving or how about a courtesy call to let us know that it would  take almost an hour, I would've have happily changed my order to suit your cooking needs rather than inconveniencing you like that. Or if you insist on keeping your customer happy, just apologize instead of making excuses and irritating people even further.....@@"}
