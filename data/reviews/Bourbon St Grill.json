{"text":"I visited on March 3, 2017 at approximately 6:45pm and my receipt HST # is 833975121RT0001. I received very poor service from the staff members there. During the ordering process, I inquired about the food options because the labels on the glass did not correspond to a particular metal tray. The staff member responded but she could not be heard because the surroundings were too loud. I then pointed to my ear, turned my face slightly, and leaned in to signal her to please repeat what the food item is.  To my disappointment, she imitated my action and laughed at me with the three other staff members there, mumbling that I'm like a grandma. I felt very humiliated in that public environment and was seriously mistreated as a customer. I spoke to the supervisor afterwards and she profusely apologized for my mistreatment. However, the staff members did not acknowledge their unprofessional behaviour. This was my first time buying from Bourbon St Grill at Eaton Centre, and it will certainly be my last."}
{"text":"The cross iron mills food court has been newly renovated and this place is impressive. Also, my family frequents Borbon St Grill at many different malls such as Southcentre and Chinook. I think this location has greater selection of items. Also, the price seems lower than  locations in the regular malls. Ok, we know this is Crossiron but I didn't expect the food court to also have discounts and greater selection compared to the mainstream locations at other malls. That's always a bonus.This place is sort of a mix between Cajun/ Asian/ Chinese dishes, which my family being Chinese likes very much. It's better  and cheaper than all the other Chinese food selections at the mall. Really, most Chinese food stalls here in Canada generally have extremely westernized versions of Chinese dishes which don't suit the taste of Chinese Canadians . We like the favours of this location's dishes. For kids there is a petite combo with smaller portion of rice or noodle plus one entr√©e.  The one meat and one vegetable combo with rice is good for me.  There's also the two veggie and one meat, and two meats and one veggie combos . Combos don't include drinks, unlike the burger places, but soft drinks are cheap for an add on. For vegetarians they also have a veggie combo at a reduced price and Caesar salad available."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite food court options in any mall I happen to be in. Today I was having a craving for their Louisiana chicken, and so I stopped by Fairview Mall just for lunch. 
As usual, the food didn't disappoint. Tasty chicken, crisp vegetables, and although the rice is pretty plain in and of itself, it adds a nice taste and texture to each mouthful. 
As others have noted, the prices seem to steadily increase here, but I still got what I thought was a good tasting, great amount of food for 10 bucks. 
As usual, the staff are fast and friendly, and had no problem giving me a taste of other meats before I decided on what to order (I stuck with the Louisiana chicken that I was craving in the first place).  
The only problem with this place is a lack of seating. I know this isn't Bourbon Street Grill's fault, as there are a lot of food places packed into this one court, but most times when I come here, if it's anywhere near the lunch hour, it's very hard to find a seat for more than one person together. Despite the seating arrangements though, I will definitely continue to come here"}
{"text":"I normally used to love going here. Until today. I got my usual order of bourbon chicken. Rice and corn. Today I was surprised to find the end of what appeared to be an EAR WIG after I was almost done my food. I wanted to go back and just request my money back without making a scene. I signalled the cashier to come closer and without saying anything I opened my container and showed her the bug.  

I like to give people the benefit of the doubt. Maybe it was a mistake and just a freak accident and this one bug just happened to crawl in the food. 

After I showed her she closed my container quickly and took it from me. She then began to Tell me she would NOT give me my money back because I already ate most of it. I told her I only found it while I was almost done and brought it to her attention as soon as I found it. She then said that since I've had it for a long time that I could've put the bug in there myself. 

THATS when I began to make a scene and let every person in that line know that I found a bug in my food. She then went to get her manager and he gave her the ok to give me my money back. They wouldn't even give me my money back with tax!!

Needless to say I will not be going back here. I'm sure this won't stop people from going but there customer service really needs to improve!"}
{"text":"WORM. 

Stopped at the new Eaton Center location, blasted through my lunch, about 80% done when I found a crushed, dead worm about an inch long. Almost barfed. 

Emailed their head office twice, no response, Called twice, no response. 

Tasty food though, WHEN THERE ISN'T A BLOODY WORM IN IT."}
{"text":"This location is pretty bad....I have had the bourbon chicken with 2 sides and a chicken Caesar salad both no good. Never again! Don't know what they are doing differently, because other locations are sooo good. Only good thing is, that the food is hot....doesn't say much."}
{"text":"Easily the best food court option at Fairview Mall. The portions are VERY generous, even for dudes. Between the jambalaya rice, tons of veggies and plentiful of chicken, it is a very satisfying meal! And all for under $10."}
{"text":"$13.00 for two meats and a vegetable. Comes with rice or noodles. Portions are relatively large, should be enough for two people to share."}
{"text":"Two or three years ago I wouldn't have had any trouble giving this location 4 or 5 stars.  The serving size has gone down yet the price goes up.  Try not to get there too early for lunch as you'll get yestersday's leftovers.  I usually get the bourbon rice, bourbon chicken & mixed veggies.  I gave them another chance last week after not going for a few months & the quality/quantity is still not worth it."}
{"text":"Warm, fresh and heaping portions. Great quality for a mall food court. For only ten dollars we got plates heaping with food. 

Its a good court, what more could you want? Hot, cheap and generous portions."}
{"text":"The food here is always good, but the service usually is the issue. The ladies there are always in a rush even if there is no line. And the worst is when I let them know it's for take out. They tend to give me the bag and put the box inside myself."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I work nearby and come here often for lunch.

Their menu is 7.49 for one veg & one meat & rice or noodles, 7.99 for two veg & one meat & rice or noodles, 8.49 for one veg & two meat & rice or noodles. They also offer salads (7.49 I believe).

The rice is amazing. They have a few different kinds, but I have only tried the Jambalayan kind. It's sort of spicy but SO delicious. It is, in fact, so good, I am not willing to try the other kinds. Instead of rice, you can also get noodles.

Their vegetables include home fries, corn, mixed veggies, zucchini, mashed potatoes, and a few others. I have tried the home fries, mixed veggies, and zucchini and they are all good, but I personally like the home fries the most.

Their meats change on a daily basis, but they normally have bourbon chicken, blackened chicken, honey glazed chicken, spicy beef, rainbow shrimp, a type of fish (I forget), and a few other chicken flavours. The bourbon chicken is amazing. Ask for extra sauce over your rice. 

The women here work fast, and will give you a sample if you are unsure of what you want. The servings are quite large. I find it's not the regular 'greasy Chinese food' you normally get, and instead, is probably decently healthy (you're in a food court, it's relative). 

The drinks are a bit expensive, so that's why they get 4 stars. If you can, buy your food here and then go to KFC or somewhere to get a cheaper drink. I also wish the meals were about 50 cents cheaper. It's still good food for the price, so I won't complain too much. Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"I come here ocassionally for food when I'm nearby and hungry. It's go to place as I like their Burbon chicken and they provide a good value for the price. The the price here have been steadily increasing over the years since I started coming. I guess it's the same everywhere. The quality of food is decent. The quality can vary a bit depending on who who is scooping your food but overall a decent amount."}
{"text":"Came here around 8:30pm which is when they start offering their end of day special.  I the Blackened fish, battered shrimp, mango salad and fried rice combo box $6.29.  The fish was very good.  Nice pepper taste and moist.  Mango salad was good too.  Shrimp was over cooked and fried rice was bland.  If you want cheap Cajun and Chinese meal then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Cajun?  Maybe, but lets add Chinese to that.

$4.79 [permanent] special of the day is [lemon?] chicken, rice or noodles, and veg. It tastes surprisingly like Manchu Wok that is a couple stores down, except for less.

Rice is regular, jambalaya rice, or chow mein style noodles. I stick with the noodles, and i stick with the special.

Combo meal is filling, chicken is saucy and  moist, noodles are  standard, veggies are fresh and lightly cooked.

Serving size seems a little larger than Manchu Wok, with a bit more veggies."}
{"text":"Just a random Fairview Mall eatery!! fast efficient speedy chicken and rice in take out boxes, good flavour comfort food  enough to fill you up for a day of shopping and hair appointments!"}
{"text":"Worst location and staff ever! Was just here and the staff don't know what they are doing or saying? Yelling at a customer is the best way to loose a customer! All 4 of the ladies working are dumb fucks! At $14 min wage a hour you would think they hire people that wanna work!  Lady ask what you would like then says it louder? Then when I give you the order, and you put some random shit in? Wtf is a matter with you?"}
{"text":"Food is great value. A big brick box of food for $8-9. Food is decent. 

Workers there are pretty terrible. They kinda just rush you through it and say things like \"Do you want veggies?\" \"Do you want meat?\" ... I ordered a combo, and all combos come with at least one meat and veggie. If i say no, youre still going to charge me for the full combo. 

Would just be nice if you asked \"what kind of veggie do you like?\" instead of trying to trick me into not taking an item in a very obvious way. Not expecting great service from a food court - the bar is pretty low, but don't be so obviously bad. Also don't scoff when ppl ask for a plastic bag because they're taking it away. Thanks."}
{"text":"Back when I ate meat, I used to love their Bourbon Chicken. For mall food, this place isn't bad. They give generous portions & you can always choose the healthier options. Now that I'm a pescatarian (eats fish but otherwise vegetarian) I was wondering at first what options they would have for me. They had plenty of vegetarian food. I got rice, zucchini mix & shrimp with veggies. With a drink it came up to about $10.00. Note to those sensitive to spicy foods: I had a taste of their blackened fish & it was too spicy for me. So beware!"}
{"text":"I love bourbon chicken. But when you can count the amount of chicken they give you, it's bad. I got the combo 1, which comes with rice or noodle and 1 side of veg. And one meat. They gave me so much rice, 4 pieces of glazed carrots and SEVEN PIECES of chicken. On top of that, the people don't speak English well."}
{"text":"Fast food with great value. Always queue outside this place. Options for meats and fishes, build your own plate type of place!"}
