{"text":"My husband and I had Dough Mama on Friday, September 11 at a weekly Food Truck rally.  I was super excited to try their pesto pizza.  Pesto and wood fired? Oh yeah!  I was severely disappointed.  The pizza crust was burnt in several spots on the bottom and it gave the whole pizza a burnt dough taste.  They have great branding with the old lady and the tile covered oven you can easily see.  But the pizza was not good.  I've had so much better from other wood fired food trucks.  Sorry Dough Mama.  I say no mama."}
{"text":"Dough Mama came by for a birthday party. Josh and his team were great. Set up in the backyard and they were slinging delicious pizza for about 2 hours, accommodating some special requests along the way.

Everyone loved the pizza. If you like the spice, go for the spicy sausage. The winners of the night seemed to be the pesto with pine nuts and the chicken-bacon-ranch, with the buffalo chicken a close third.

Looking forward getting some Dough Mama next time I see that truck."}
{"text":"I came across this food truck while it was parked outside my office building and decided to give it a try.  I appreciated the variety of toppings offered for the \"build your own\" pizza option.  The size of the pizza is approximately 10\" (just a guess) and is cooked on a wood fire which is nice.  The price is a little high, but I think the quality is worth it."}
{"text":"I had Dough Mama cater an event  for me and it was as good as any wood fired pizza in the Valley. The salads were all fresh and the guests loved the 6 varieties of pizza. They will do my next party."}
{"text":"We had them come to our Regus location in Tempe. Working with the owners was so easy. The pizza is so delicious.Our clients loved the pizza as well. We are looking forward to having them come out  again!"}
{"text":"Saw the Dough Mama truck at a local school event. We ordered a Margherita pizza (see photo), and it came out fresh and delicious. 

The people who run the truck were nice. Prices were reasonable. Would order from them again. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"Great food truck experience. I stop by on Food truck Thursday's at ASU. The service was fast and friendly and the pizza was extremely good. I ordered the Spicy Sausage and it was done perfectly complete with the wood fired taste. BTW, they have a full blown wood burning oven within the food truck. They also offer reasonably priced waters and other beverages."}
{"text":"The food truck came to my work today so I decided to give it a try. Besides the price being a little high ($9), the pepperoni pizza was delicious. It's definitely enough for 1 person. The staff were quick and very friendly. You won't be disappointed eating here!"}
{"text":"What's brackin blood!? I am tacking on another star. The last 2 pies I ordered here were brispy, and loaded with toppings. Maybe they saw my last review or something."}
