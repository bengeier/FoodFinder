{"text":"We loved the food!  Stopped by on the drive home from AZ, ordered food to go.  The service was outstanding, friendly, helpful and they offered us something to drink while we waited.  The best BBQ in the Henderson/Boulder City area!  The restaurant and bathrooms were very clean too :)  We will definitely go back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, lost a star because wait staff left us hanging without follow up after meal served. Nobody came around again.

Had to hover over register to get, and pay tab.

Ice tea is instant, not fresh."}
{"text":"This is our first visit here. We were greeted with a friendly smile and an explanation of the menu.  We each ordered a 2 meat 2 side item combo so we could try several things. So glad we did. The meats, both the brisket and pulled pork, were very tender and flavorful. We loved the mac-n- cheese, it is fabulous!  The beans have meat in them and a nice complement to the potato salad and wonderful mayonnaised based cole slaw.  We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The beef brisket was incredible, tender, falls apart and tastes even better with the bbq sauce. The cornbread was delicious and best, cheesiest mac and cheese ever. Great service, friendly staff and clean restrooms. You want good bbq? This is the place to eat, especially after that long drive from the Grand Canyon, and it is conveniently located less than a mile from the freeway."}
{"text":"Amazing food! To bad we are not from here, but definitely visiting again when in town.  Great customer service, and even got a tour of the kitchen from the owner."}
{"text":"Delicious!  The pulled pork is so good!  And the jalapeno mac & cheese is creamy, cheesy and downright YUMMY!  We've had the pulled pork sandwich, smoked brisket, mac & cheese and the cowboy beans and all of it is great! The sandwich is a meal, especially with a side.  All the food is reasonably priced and worth every penny.  

So happy you opened in Boulder City!  Thank you!  Keep up the delicious food!"}
{"text":"The ribs are KILLER. $1 PBRs don't hurt either. This is the best bbq joint I've tried since moving to Nevada 7 years ago. They recently doubled the eat in dining which is cool. Nice peeps and good food!"}
{"text":"If you are ever in the Vegas area and are making a side trip to the Hover Damn, you must stop in to this great little smokehouse. It was great, the owner even took us into the kitchen to the smoker, he was a great guy. Still think of the meal we had back in April.

Thanks and Merry Christmas

{"text":"On way back from Hoover dam and found this gem.  For what is available, and price, easy to give 5 stars.  Small. Friendly. Family feel.  Ribs super tender.  Brisket awesome.  Will never waste a meal in Boulder city again, and will go here every time. 

Dam good!"}
{"text":"There are lots of BBQ houses around the Vegas valley. Few though live up to true BBQ in the meat dept. Fox Smokehouse is one of the very few. Not only is the pick of meat premium, what they do with it after is superb. I had a combo with ribs and brisket slaw and cowboy fries. Thank God I was hungry. The meat on the ribs clung to the bone until my teeth told it to let go with ever so slight a pull. Their dry rub is classic on the meat. Just enough to pull out the sweetness of the pork. Brisket was beautifully  marbled with a great smoke crust to hold it all together.  
Their side slaw is dressed well with a nice cube cut on the cabbage. This allows you to enjoy without getting it on you. Which happens to me all too often. Cowboy fries are hardy with a kidney bean chilli crowning with cheese enough to make it a meal in itself. 
Their dining room is clean and simple. With some cute personal touches. Nice selection of beer with a couple of good IPA'S 
A little off the beaten path but worth the trip."}
{"text":"We live here and have ordered BBQ a few times from this place. Don't understand all the great reviews. Ribs were overdone (the meat shouldn't be falling off the bone), brisket was ok, not much flavor, sides were actually crap! Plus it's way overpriced. Vegas area has plenty of better more affordable choices. Memphis BBQ blows this place away, as well as Lucille's, and Famous Dave's. Seriously, it's amazing all these reviewers are so incredibly wrong, main reason I had to correct things with this review.

Update: The owners responded and thought some profanity was used in my review? It's funny how insecure they are about one REAL Review. I don't see any profanity in the review."}
{"text":"Visiting from San Jose, CA. Stopped by after the Hoover Dam tour after searching Yelp. Did not disappoint, great BBQ and awesome service! Had the ribs and brisket combo, both were so tender. Definitely stop by this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ place with excellent and friendly service. Top choice for Boulder City, and on the way to Hoover Dam. Would definitely go back ;-)"}
{"text":"Everything was excellent! Very generous portions of meat. Try the hot sauce. It's really good and not too spicy. The sweet potato fries were also excellent. The cheesecake was very good too. The staff were all very friendly and took great care of us."}
{"text":"This was some of the best bbq ive ever had!! Its a small hole in the wall place, but the food was great, staff was really friendly, and the restaurant was very clean. Ill definitely be back next time im in the area!!  I had he pulled pork platter with potato salad and mac n cheese. The pulled pork was a generous portion of tender chunks of pork that just fell apart. The potato salad was good, although i wasnt a fan of the chunks of olives in it (but theyre easy enough to pick out). The mac n cheese was SO good. I had to keep my husband from eating all of it because he loved it too. Oh, and they offer $1 PBR all day every day!!! What's not to love about this place!

Also, if you might get there a little before 11am (when they officially open) dont worry, they usually open a little before then and are very accommodating."}
{"text":"As some others reported, we stopped here for dinner on the way back to Vegas from Hoover Dam. Great food, low prices, what more could one want? My wife and I split a barbecue chicken sandwich, all good."}
{"text":"We drive right over from Las Vegas to enjoy our favorite bbq. Ribs fall of the bone and are delicious! Great smoked flavor and perfect sauces to compliment. Awesome beans, mac & cheese and always friendly service! Among the many times we eat here, food & service is consistently the best! Everyone we recommend are always happy. We stick to our favorites but will try great looking desserts & new items next time!"}
{"text":"We stopped here after a disappointing trip to Grand Canyon west (were you have to pay $50 to just look at the Grand Canyon!) and had the most amazing BBQ ever!!!! The ribs, both pork and beef, were amazing! The Mac n' cheese was perfect and the Cowboy fries are revolutionary! We had a chance to meet with the owner, super nice guy! If you are anywhere near Las Vegas you have to come out to this place. It's a hole-in-the-wall spot with amazing food and tons of heart! And don't forget to order the award winning caramel apple parfait!!!"}
{"text":"This has been, for a long time, one of the only 2 places out of all of boulder city that I actually recommend to people coming into town. Staff is ALWAYS super friendly, decent prices for the amound of food you get, and the food is delicious. Cowboy beans may funk up your stomach, but they are good. I reccomend the sliders if you are going for your firat time, that way you get to try two different meats. Every place in boulder wants to act like they have the best burger is boulder, but their smoked brisket burger is out of control good. And if you want some cheap beer, you really cant beat a $3 pitcher of pbr. Dining in will make you smell like you just left a BBQ, but its worth it. If thats not something youre into, they do take out as well. Keep your eye out for that creamy jalapeno or something green sauce if they still have it. They said its expensive to buy, but it is GOOD."}
{"text":"This place is a must go to if you love bbq. The brisket is tender with the perfect amount of smoke. Try the cowboy fries and cornbread. My son had the Mac and cheese and thoroughly enjoyed it. Overall, a great experience and we'll be back."}
{"text":"I had the brisket sandwich on a texas toast with cole slaw (it was so delicious). This place is a mist go to if you love bbq. The brisket is so tender. The staff is super nice...."}
{"text":"Stopped by after visiting the dam, and I am glad we did.  It was great.  The kids loved the wings and ribs.  My wife and I enjoyed the great tasting brisket sandwich.  We would recommend this BBQ to anyone in the area to make the stop."}
{"text":"We are visiting Hoover dam.  This was the perfect place to stop and fill up. Excellent food. Excellent service. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ anywhere near Las Vegas -- hands down. You'd never find this hole in the wall without looking on yelp, or elsewhere on the internet... but if you've gotten this far, follow through-- you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this restaurant is that is not on the tourist trail. It's located in Boulder City NV but only the locals and Yelp reviewers can find it. First thing that hits you is the aroma of the bbq beef in the oven....So wonderful you can almost taste it.
 You must try the melt in your mouth brisket beef. The owner Dan and associates treat you like family (good family)....The prices are reasonable and the sides are home made and seasoned to perfection. It only seats about 25 peopke so let's keep this secret hideaway restaurant to ourselves"}
{"text":"Awesome food... TENDER fall off the bone ribs! The mac n cheese was cheesy and spicy. The sauce is sweet and spicy... the service was pleasant best service thus far!!"}
{"text":"Our first time in here and we feel like we've been coming here on a regular basis. The service is amazing, bar none. And the food? Phenomenal! Smokehouse burger, Mac and cheese and cowboy fries! So good!!!! Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend and the concierge recommended this place- it's a Simple little restaurant with great food. I had the pulled pork tacos and my friend had the brisket ... fabulous!!! The waitress was super nice.. I would go back again."}
{"text":"Never had BBQ this good. Fall off the bone ribs, brisket that melts in your mouth. The sauce, simply amazing. Mac 'n Cheese worthy of sitting in between those two delicious meets. A must stop in when visiting the area."}
{"text":"My husband couldn't stop raving about his tri-tip sandwich and the cowboy beans - best sandwich he has had in a long time!  My daughter and I split the sliders (1 chicken/1 brisket) and they were very good - plus, large portions so perfect for sharing.  Friendly waitress and no wait (we were there right before the lunch rush in a weekday).  I love places like this that look like a hole in the wall yet have awesome food."}
{"text":"The family drives twenty miles one way to fix our craving. It's the best barbecue in the southwest, better than Dave's and Tony's hands down. It's the only place our two year old son will just sit down and eat. We can't get enough and we always end up ordering extra to go. You have to try this barbecue it will be your best new addiction."}
{"text":"In from CA visiting family. They took us to this BBQ place to try. We walked in and the smell was amazing. Super friendly staff and owner. Helped us decide on what to eat. Everything was so good. I had the brisket and loved it. Thank you for your hospitality!  Eat in or to go."}
{"text":"We are from Virginia, and we're on the way to the Hoover Dam. Stopped in Boulder City for lunch, and decided to give this place a try. Everything we tried was delicious! My husband and I split the two meat combo with two sides, then he decided to also get the pork sliders. All was wonderful."}
{"text":"This place had awesome food! Everything we ordered we loved! Great atmosphere and small family feel - we were even sent with free dessert!"}
{"text":"Finally the best BBQ Brisket and Ribs so tender l've ever had. The owner Dan came over to tell us about his place so friendly seems like old friends already. Highly recommend this any day."}
{"text":"Fantastic bbq. The brisket was so tender and the ribs amazing! The ribs had a nice bark on them, and their sauce are really tasty. Also the mac n cheese might have been the best ever and the chili was great. Also had cornbread, excellent too and my friend said the burger was amazing, but I couldn't eat any more. Definitely be talking about this one. And the staff was awesome, so BAM! there you go."}
{"text":"Ditto to everything everyone says. Service was excellent - very personable. Everything we ate was amazing (especially the ranch beans/Mac n cheese combo)! Owner came out and paid us a special visit which was great too. Thanks to all!"}
{"text":"As a former Texan, I am very picky about BBQ. Fox Smokehouse BBQ is the first place in or near Las Vegas that knows how to do Texas style BBQ. They smoke their brisket & pulled pork for 12 hours over hickory wood using a dry rub. The result is tender juicy meat with a deep smoky flavor just the way BBQ should be. They also do ribs & chicken. Their Cowboy beans & mac & cheese are surprisingly good. They have 2 BBQ sauces - regular @ spicy. For Texas style BBQ, nothing in this area comes close!"}
{"text":"This is a nice off the path place.  The brisket sandwich was awesome, nice and tender.  The cowboy beans very good with just a little heat, almost consistence of chilly.  They have two Sauces mild and Spicy, it is \"bring the heat\".
Apparently they do cater. The place is kinda small."}
{"text":"Best brisket ever!!!! Staff was very friendly and the price is great. Definitely recommend for anyone in Boulder city or for those visiting Las Vegas to try this place. It is definitely worth the 30 min drive out here especially if you already plan on seeing the Hoover dam."}
{"text":"Had the brisket sandwich with everything (cole slaw, pickles, hot peppers)!  It was excellent. Side of cowboy beans and cornbread. Top notch BBQ!"}
{"text":"Best barbeque place! Great service and yummy food (especially the Mac and cheese, ribs and peach cobbler) definitely going back"}
{"text":"My family and I went here hoping to finally find great bbq...well it's was AMAZING! The staff was friendly, the food was delicious. We got the brisket and tri-tip sandwiches on Texas toast. The sweet potatoes fries are really good. We will definitely be back to visit. Thank you for the memorable experience on Mother's Day!"}
{"text":"After looking at all the great reviews and recommendations from friends, we finally dropped by! Super friendly staff. They were kind enough to explain to us their best sellers and our server's favorite dish. 
The smokehouse burger was really good. It has brisket mixed in with the meat. A little dry, but the BBQ sauce makes up for it. Also ordered the brisket and pulled pork.... it was delicious !!!
I highly recommend the brisket and ribs with the spicy BBQ sauce!"}
{"text":"After visiting Hoover Damn, we found this place and glad we did. The food was delicious. The meat falling of the bones on the ribs, wow. The service that Dee gave was amazing. She made us feel comfortable and welcome. Highly recommend this place and will be coming back when in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm giving Fox Smokehouse BBQ four stars because after one visit and a taste of their food I can definitely say \"Yay! I'm a fan.\" 

For the following reasons:

1. The service was good. I don't care how great the food is at a place if the service is anything below courteous and easy, you've lost me-- most likely for good. Service matters so much in this day and age. My money is hard earned and I refuse to spend it at any place that has anything below good service. Having good service tells me you value me as a customer and that is of first importance. I walked in and the woman at the counter was courteous, respectful, and the food was served up fast. This makes me happy and means I'll be back.

2. I got the smallest meal pack they have (the one that serves 4) It has, a 1/2 rack of ribs, half pound of pork and half pound of chicken. I wanted some for my own lunch, some for my husband, and some for later. The sides I chose were the cole slaw and cowboy beans. I'm not into ribs -- my husband can give his opinion on those. But the chicken and pork: mouthwatering, tender and delicious. The beans and slaw are excellent. I usually don't like the beans at BBQ places but these are wonderful. Can totally tell they and the slaw are homemade. I chose the spicy sauce and it is also wonderful. Still need to try the mild sauce.

I'll definitely return to this place. My hope is they keep the service consistent. At times that seems harder to pull off than the food for some places. I also get what it means to be a husband and wife run business as I'm part of one of those myself. So glad to see another wonderful food choice here in BC."}
{"text":"Best BBQ EVER! No need for a fork, the meat falls apart on its own, juicy and tender. Excellent service, comfortable down home atmosphere. If you're in the area... stop here!"}
{"text":"Simply the best we have found in the Vegas area! The brisket was fall apart tender you could eat it with a spoon. The sides all fresh and very good as well. The beans especially! They mix their own BBQ sauce in both spicy and sweet varieties, all good. We definitely found little our goto place for well done BBQ. Worth the trip and we'll be back."}
{"text":"It was great there. The food was delicious! I had the pulled pork sandwhich with mac n chesse. My boyfriend had the brisket sandwhich with sweet potatoe fries. Everything was amazing. You gotta try it out."}
{"text":"Really good bbq!! Been all over the south and this is as good or better than some southern bbq! 
Sides were great especially the Mac n cheese!!
We had the smoked wing and pork and brisket everything was good not to dry and crunchy ends.
They had a great soundings dessert but we were too full also they have beer and wine and seem to do a lot of take out., we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome bbq, a surprise on our way to the Hoover Dam. Big portions, my husband and I split the sliders and two sides, and it was more than enough."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, cool family atmosphere... The brisket is top notch, beans good as advertised, and Cole slaw and Mac n cheese both are great sides..."}
{"text":"Excellent ribs!! Make sure you have the cowboy beans... Delicious!! Great family too.  Super lovely people and LOVE the food!"}
{"text":"Just had the most AMAZING BBQ!!! Stopped here on a whim traveling through Boulder City, and My wife and I are SO glad we did! I had the pulled pork tacos with some classic crinkle cut fries(which had a very nice unique seasoning on them). I loved the spicy house made BBQ sauce!! My wife had the combo #1 with pulled pork and a side of house made Mac N Cheese. Again, amazingly delicious! Mac N Cheese had a nice note of jalapeño, but not overpowering and not drenched in butter. Just cheesy and nice! To top it off we had the award winning caramel apple parfait for desert. Thumbs up and hats off to our super nice and OUTSTANDING server Lisa and gracious and delightful owner Dan! We love this place, its food, and its staff!! Can't wait to come back for more, and more, and MORE!!!!! Thank you Fox Smokehouse!!!!"}
{"text":"Skip the tourist traps on Main St, get the real deal here. Great service, great food. Very friendly owner, very interactive and caring. Loved the brisket, mac&cheese is to die for. Thanks y'all! I'd love to have a vinegar based sauce in addition to your other 2 fantastic sauces."}
{"text":"I dare you to get a bad meal here.  Everything is great - and you have to have the apple cheesecake parfait.  Friendly accommodating staff.  You can eat in or get any item to-go.  Just off the main route through Boulder City, but well worth finding."}
{"text":"People you must go here!!! This BBQ is amazing! And my grandpa is from Texas and has built his own smoker with a smokestack of an old truck so I know what BBQ is! And PBR for $1! I wish there was a choice for 10 stars! Shout to our server...I forgot her name dark hair with glasses. She is awesome. Spunky and fun!"}
{"text":"This weekend was a reunion for several of us Marines who served together years ago.  We took a day trip to Hoover dam and afterwards decided to grab some BBQ.  

I am an avid bbq/smoker myself and like to try various \"mom and pop\" shops and if I  am able, to talk to the pit master themselves.  Fox Smokehouse had been highly recommended by a friend and coworker, originally from Oklahoma,  who said Fox' cooking was reminiscent of Oklahoma /Texas style bbq.  Being from Arkansas,  this immediately peaked my interest. 

To cut to the point, the recommendation was a great one. The servers were very happy and helpful in explaining the menu and providing suggestions as to the dishes most commonly purchased. Making our food orders was easy thanks to the combination plates available and the aroma of the pit had our mouths watering as the servers described the various cuts of meat. 

The owner, Dan Fox, came out a couple of times to talk with us,  which is when we learned he too was a Marine and an Okee, which explained the smoking style of the pit master. 

When our plates arrived, they were well portioned amounts of meat, most of us choosing the brisket and ribs.  The hickory flavor was very good and the dry rub a nice blend of seasoning, giving the perfect blend of heat and sweet. 

The mac and cheese was amazing with plenty of real cheese and smoke flavor.  The cowboy beans were different,  but good, they were exactly what one would expect on a cattle drive, a little bit of left overs and extras such as pork, celery, spices, onions, and beans all mixed and smoked together over hickory.  

My only regret is that I live an hour away from this restaurant and can't make it a weekly treat to get my bbq fix when I'm not doing my own smoking!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ and the sides are pretty damn good too!  Mac and cheese is a must as a side."}
{"text":"Best meal I've ever eaten. Get burnt ends if they have them. We'll be back every time we come near Boulder City."}
{"text":"We ate ribs, which were a disappointment.  They seemed very fatty compared to many other rib places I've been to.  Staff was very friendly.  You have to park in the street."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The brisket and ribs were fantastic and the sweet potato fries were the best I've ever had. Hit the spot after a day on the lake!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I've searched Vegas for good BBQ, and always came away with the same thoughts, \"just ok\".  My new go to place is Fox Smokehouse BBQ.  Had the brisket sandwich and fries for lunch, outstanding!  Made to order, hot and fresh.  
The owners, Kelly and Dan take pride in their craft, and it shows.
I'll be back to try more dishes on the menu.  
Worth the drive!  Best BBQ in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ, truly tasty and delicious. The service were nice, making sure that everything was alright.
The ribs were amazing, especially with a little BBQ dressing on top. Combo #4 can be recommended either for sharing, or for one person (but only if that one person can eat a lot).
But yeah, if you're ever in Boulder City, make sure to give it a visit!"}
{"text":"Simply the best BBQ in town including all of LAS Vegas! The BBQ here is just on point. If you are in the area do not pass this up!"}
{"text":"Everything was awesome! It reminded me of back home in Texas. I had pulled pork and bratwurst. Usually pulled pork is too rich for me to finish the whole pile but not this stuff! The bratwurst was smoked very well and I ate all of it too. The sauces are great, cowboy beans and potato salad were awesome. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"So freakin delicious!!! Price is just right and the spicy ketchup is good as well! Meat is tender and juicy."}
{"text":"First off... you pull up to this place and the smell of BBQ is in the air. You start to get stoked. You walk in and it smells even better. The food was delicious. I had the brisket sandwich on toasty bread with some cowboy fries 10/10. I think I heard them say they make their own BBQ sauce. I put some on every bite I took. Service was quick. Server was nice, great hospitality. Very clean setting. Me and my two friends left super satisfied. Best place to eat in Boulder City hands down!"}
{"text":"Place is on a side road off the main thoroughfare in Boulder City. Don't be discouraged by the \"strip mall\" type locale. 

Ordered ribs and brisket combo. The ribs were the best I've ever had. Seriously.  Get the ribs. I've been to Texas, KC, North Carolina, all pale to these ribs. Fantastic tenderness and chew to them. Not too heavily sauced so you can taste the smoke in the meat. 

Mac and cheese was awesome too, had green chile in them to give them a little kick but not what I would call spicy at all. 

Lisa waited on us, she was fantastic. 

Thanks Fox bbq. We will be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Incredible food. Dont go for the ambiance. It's seaside shack, but with mind-blowing smoked fish."}
{"text":"Ribs have taste and texture of Pork Belly. Cowboy cheese fries were delish. Brisket isn't one bit fatty. Worth driving here more often. Mac n cheese has a good bite to it. Pulled pork was so juicy."}
{"text":"Best BBQ we've had maybe ever. The pulled pork was lean and tasty, the ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, and the beans and fried okra sides were delicious. The service was quick and friendly. If you are in Boulder City checking out the Hoover Dam make sure to stop here for lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent bbq!  Everything was delicious.   The ribs were to die for and the pork sandwich was so good.  Don't pass this one up."}
{"text":"That is, by far, the best ribs I've ever had. Falling off the bone, can hardly keep it on my fork. Awesome sauce as well, wonderfully sweet with a little burn at the end. Amazing cowboy beans as well, packed full of flavor & ingredients."}
{"text":"Awesome tri-tip tacos, I'd highly recommend it if you're hungry and want good honest small business food."}
{"text":"We passed through Boulder City on our way to the Hoover Dam. We ordered two meats (chicken and brisket) with mac and cheese and fries. Everything was delicious. My husband the grill master commented that he could not have done it better himself. That is a HUGE compliment. A family of four left full and ready to explore what Hoover Dam has to offer."}
{"text":"The Frickin chicken is the BOSS! The sauce is mindblowing!! I like the pulled pork and the service is FAST... I am happy that they are soo close to my work..."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ. Definitely worth the drive. I am not a huge fan of BBQ but I will be asking to put this on our places to stop at again. The staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"I am a Kansas City BBQ Society master judge. I stopped in with another judge to try the Q and must admit it was great. We shared Brisket, Pulled Pork, Ribs and Chicken and they were all very good. A great place to go for BBQ I would recommend it to everyone. Great job Kelly & Dan.  And if you like mild  green chili you have to try the Mac & Cheese."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for lunch, and it is amazing.  Had the brisket sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, Mac and cheese, and coleslaw.  The best BBQ I have had in a long time.  Very simple cool atmosphere.  Will definitely be a regular there."}
{"text":"Fantastic bbq!!! The sauces (mild and spicy) are homemade and taste amazing! The two ladies running the front of the house are  sweet and inviting and make the experience even better here. This is by far my favorite bbq spot in vegas! I have had the turkey sandwich, brisket, pulled pork, mac n cheese, cowboy beans/fries, coleslaw and blueberry cheesecake; all were so delicious. No complaints about anything here!"}
{"text":"Smokehouse deserves everything star. The service is prompt and friendly. The ribs and brisket are melt in your mouth tender. The cornbread is almost the best I've ever had and I'm from the South!  The cowboy beans are meaty and flavorful. Don't miss it!!"}
{"text":"Finally a great BBQ spot near Las Vegas!! Went on a spontaneous trip to Boulder City for a birthday celebration. Yelped this spot a few weeks back so decided to try it. I mean it is 5 star rated ;)

A great, home feel spot with delicious BBQ! We had the \"combo #4\", selected the ribs, brisket, beans and the amazing Mac and cheese. All were exceptionally cooked. The Mac and cheese was one of our favorites. I had been craving some corn bread and it did not disappoint! Even the butter was already at room temperature!! Although small, the restaurant is reasonably attractive with awesome rusty art on the walls and  cool 80s music!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. We had the brisket, baked beans and coleslaw. My kids had the grilled cheese which was super cheesy and the French fries which were fantastic. I would definitely come here again. I left the restaurant stuffed."}
{"text":"This place is great. Brisket is awesome, pulled pork is awesome, coleslaw is awesome. Most of the time I never order fries anywhere I go, but the seasoning they use makes the fries really good. Extremely friendly and attentive from the moment we walked in till the moment we walked out the door. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"From the BBQ to the sides, everything was delicious!!! And the service was great as well! We'll definitely go back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"This is the best secret in Boulder city. The brisket is my favorite. Our waitress was the greatest. I can't remember her name, but she was so helpful. She made suggestions on the menu. We couldn't wait to come back. We did 2 days later. 
I am craving their food now writing this review."}
{"text":"Found this FANTASTIC BBQ joint after visiting Hoover Dam with the family. The meat just fell off the bone. Great dry rub with or without sauce.
Mandatory stop after Hoover Dam and worth the drive from Las Vegas........"}
{"text":"It's a little tucked away behind a shopping center and not the easiest to find. The food was great and so was the service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The brisket sandwich was awesome. Waitstaff were friendly and service was prompt even though there was a large private party in 3/4 of the dining area. Owner/manager stopped by to check in. Definitely 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Dam! Ha! We stopped here after visiting the Hoover Dam, we haven't gotten all the dam jokes out of our system. If you like BBQ you owe it to yourself to eat here. If you skip this place you're missing out. It's amaaaazing!! Just a little off the road, but it is a gem without a doubt."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a number of times and the food is excellent. I've had just about everything on the menu and it's all delicious. You can't go wrong!! My favorite however are the ribs and Mac n cheese. The best I've ever had!!! And the BBQ sauce is soooo good. 
  My husband raves about the smoked turkey sandwich and the chicken (both of which are fantastic). The customer service is outstanding. Everyone is nice and friendly. It's just a really nice place to eat."}
{"text":"You say, \"Damn J. M.! Another BBQ review? Are you obsessed? The only answer is, \"Hells yeah!\" This lil spot just a few miles from the Hoover Dam, was a great find. The service was friendly and attentive, the beers were cold, and the ribs and brisket were tender, juicy and flavorful. The sauce options included sweet and hot, respectively; so, of course, I mixed them -life is good. Live a little, after you go to Vegas and take your pic in front of the sign, drive over and check out the engineering marvel that is the Hoover Dam. And then, when you have worked up an appetite from all that walking, let the Fox satiate your hunger for delicious barbecue! Recommend highly!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Southern NV! The ribs literally fall off the bones, very meaty and excellent flavor. Chicken is excellent too! Cowboy fries were great, all good! Service was quick and friendly. Highly recommend if in the area."}
{"text":"Fox Smokehouse BBQ has a very friendly staff, everyone is very knowledgeable and will tell you their favorite items if you need help deciding. Brisket is very soft and the BBQ sauces are deliciously paired with them. Mac and cheese has 5 different cheeses and is great as a side. I would definitely recommend this place if you are traveling through Boulder City and or staying here for a trip!"}
{"text":"The best BBQ ever! Love the coleslaw, love the sweet potato fries and here is no better brisket than right here. The ribs are fabulous.
I tried the new tacos with pulled pork and they were amazing. Huge.
Come hungry...the portions are big."}
{"text":"Very, very good barbecue. The beef brisket can be a little lean, sometimes, but that's just a personal preference. The pulled pork is fantastic. It's a small business, and they make the food fresh every morning, so when the food is gone, it's gone. There were times when we ordered take-out and didn't call in in time. But that's not a bad thing; it means that the food is really good. The fries are crisp and hot, the macaroni and cheese is creamy and rich. Beans are good. 
They started out in a small walk-in only space in the building without tables, and they've gone through at least two expansions to keep up with the demand. The seating area is informal and the service is prompt and friendly. They display all the trophies they've won at barbecue contests. These people know how to cook. 
It may be a little hard to find the place because it's behind a large mall, but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped here after the Hoover Dam.  Everything was great including the brisket and pulled pork.  However, the ribs were fantastic.  Strong smoke flavor, tender and moist, perfect!"}
{"text":"Finally went to this spot that I've had bookmarked for quite a while. I can see what it has 5 stars. Everything was awesome! I got a two meat combo with brisket and ribs. The sides were Mac n cheese and their beans. I live in Summerlin and will def be back regardless of the drive. Best BBQ I've had and those sides are something to be proud of."}
{"text":"Stopped here to eat after hiking.  Had our dog with us so the outside seating was perfect.  Waitress even brought cup of water for our pet without us asking.  Food was delicious and reasonably priced.  Very clean restaurant and excellent service."}
{"text":"I have lived in boulder city for awhile now and this place doesn't get enough credit. Many people don't know about this place but it's absolutely amazing. My boyfriend and I both had the pulled pork and we loved it! Great taste and not too saucy. Although for people like me who love sauce they have bottles of it on the tables for your convenience. It's sort of pricey. But overall great food!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and food! Meat was literally falling of the bone!!! Fried okra and Mac n cheese were tasty. Hidden gem of a place. Very good!"}
{"text":"Absolutely best pulled pork BBQ sandwich in Nevada. Everything about Fox BBQ is absolutely awesome!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight for the first time. Ordered half a rack of ribs and 2 sandwiches with sides. Got home and realized we didn't have the half rack of ribs in our bag. We called and Kelly answered her response was \"Well everyone here says they gave it to you, but whatever you say\" in a very unpleasant tone. We said just forget it then and hung up. I could not believe the rudeness, plus we are missing half of our dinner! 
Update: The owner reached out to us and apologized and offered to make up for it. Sometimes these things happen, and second chances should be given. They do have pretty good BBQ and we will be going back in the future."}
{"text":"This place has ok BBQ. As a BBQ guy that both eats and cooks it. I have to say it's just ok. Not all that. The smoke on the meat is almost not noticeable. By the smell out side and as you walk in I would expect a much more pronounced flavor in the meat. Weak on smoke and flavor overall. Lots on pepper on the almost steamed Brisket."}
{"text":"Been meaning to write this review since our AMAZING meal at Fox BBQ back in November.  I was working on a film in Vegas and had a bunch of friends come visit, so we took a day trip to Hoover Dam.  We decided to stop for lunch in Boulder City after our dam tour, and before hiking.  Found Fox Smokehouse on yelp and 8 of us descended on this little strip mall temple of BBQ. Not only was every meat delicious, moist and fresh - and we are picky BBQ eaters - the sides were killer too.  Not expensive, friendly service, Cowboy Beans are terrific, and melt in your mouth brisket + great sauce & sides - you can't go wrong.  We refueled, and actually ended up on a better hiking trail than the one we'd planned on thanks to a tip from the Fox Smokehouse staff (we ended up on the old railway trail not far from the restaurant - super cool as you get to walk through old railway tunnels).  Don't hesitate to eat here, it stands up to great BBQ we've had anywhere in the USA."}
{"text":"Friendly service and great food, has the tri-tip sandwich, half rack and pulled pork sandwich... And great beer selection."}
{"text":"This place was a wonderful surprise after leaving Las Vegas. The barbecue pork and brisket were top notch. The toppings were a great addition.  Service was friendly and knowledgeable.  It was definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"Driving across the country from LA to NYC:) on the way just little bit after Las Vegas our AC in the car stoped working:( while our car was getting fixed at MCDelco we went to \"Fox Smokehouse BBQ\" for lunch! I must say best brisket sandwich  I have had in my life! Service was very good, friendly and fast:) thank you"}
{"text":"Best ribs in Vegas let alone Boulder City. Beans, outstanding. Slaw, awesome. Well worth the short drive. A must to take all visitors to."}
{"text":"I loved the spicy mac and cheese. The pulled chicken was perfect. The atmosphere is great with a very friendly staff. Only reason why I give it 4 stars is parking was a little tricky, of course that was during an early lunch. I can only imagine during a rush! Definitely check this place out after visiting the Hoover Dam."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to some good barbecue. I mean it should be good with all these 5 star ratings. Wrong! Now I'm very suspicious about how they could've gotten all these great ratings. The meat was absolutely dry. I hate dried out meat & that's not what I want to pay for. I got the brisket & tri-tips. The tri-tips were thinly sliced like paper and that's exactly how they tasted no matter how much barbecue sauce I put on them. I just put them aside because I couldn't eat them. The waitress later deducted them off my meal & said they're supposed to go on a sandwich & with all of the stuff on them, they wouldn't be so dry. Well I wouldn't want that kind of dry meat on a sandwich. The mac & cheese was just Ok. The cornbread was a disappointment because they were cold. On the menu it said they were to be served warm. So going to this restaurant was a huge waste of time & money."}
{"text":"This place is bomb!!!!!! Try the teriyaki chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries! Perfection."}
{"text":"I was looking for a great rib place in Las Vegas and happened to see this place listed in Boulder City. When I pulled up out front I wasn't overly impressed. Even when I walked in it looked kind of like a diner. When I looked at the menu I was kind of surprised the prices were cheaper than quoted over the phone. One meat with the side was only $10 and two meats with a side was only 15. I tried the brisket and the ribs with the side of macaroni and cheese. The service was great, the food was superb, the value was incredible. Only downside is they served plastic silverware and paper plates. On Monday night they offer $1 Pabst Blue Ribbon beer and a $4 margarita. All in all, this will definitely be a regular place. Well worth the drive and definitely my top choice for value and quality! Congratulations to the owners for offering fantastic food at very reasonable prices! Although it would be nice to get metal silverware and perhaps even some plates to eat off of. It would definitely complement your food tremendously! Seriously good, seriously affordable!"}
{"text":"Did a tour of the Hoover Dam today and we worked up an appetite.  So I opened the Yelp app and searched for close restaurants. We saw BBQ was only 6 miles away which was great news.  We ordered pulled pork and brisket sandwiches with fries. Both were very tender and flavorful. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. We also had desert. It was the award winning carmel custard apple desert. I can see why it's an award winner. WOW! I could eat that every day. Now that I know where they are located I plan to stop again during my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"PROS: 
Excellent service from the young lady. She even gave my little toddler her own little water cup container with a short straw. Clean highchair, which is a plus.  We ordered the brisket, ribs, sausages, cornbread, mac & cheese, and sweet potatoe fries. Delicious bbq! Smoked perfectly. The meat fell right off the bone on the ribs. Just delicious! I love the flavor of the mild bbq sauce. I had to ask for some to go.  I haven't had a good bbq in a long time. We normally go to Lucille's in Green Valley Ranch area. My husband said, it's much better than Lucille's. I have to agree. A friend from work has been talking about this place. She comes here twice a week, since she lives in Boulder City. Another friend of mine swears by this place. Now I know why. 
CONS:  
I wish it was closer to my house. :)"}
{"text":"This was by far one of best meals I have eaten in a very long time and the owners of this business are incredibly kind. Highly recommend trying the Mac and cheese!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome everything I tried was delicious. I recommend getting the brisket spicy . It not really spicy FYI just super juicy and tender. So as we first walk in you see a lot of people in the  restaurant is it  jam packed. It was a little of a wait time before we got service but was worth the wait . Mac and cheese was a unique delight it has jalapenos but doesn't have a kick just the taste. I do think that this place is very delicious and it's a must try"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Nevada without a doubt, it's only draw back is that it isn't located in my house!!!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I stopped in for a late lunch after visiting Hoover Dam.  Based on the very solid five-star average on Yelp, we had high expectations.  Unfortunately, those expectations were not met. I ordered the two meat combo plate ($15.00) consisting of brisket, ribs, and potato salad.  The BBQ was decent but far from mind blowing and far from five-star good in my book.  For example, the ribs on my plate seemed quite fatty almost to the point of being excessively fatty, and the brisket tasted so so.  I've had better at lots of places.  Perhaps it was late in the day or just an off day, but I don't understand the five star reviews.  Most of the staff we encountered were friendly and attentive, so no complaints in that department."}
{"text":"Best smoked brisket I've ever had... my boyfriend actually introduced me to this place when I was working in the area for a few weeks. I loved it so much I took my coworkers the next day and over the next couple of weeks we went back a total of 5 times! Everyone couldn't get enough... sides are large, staff is great, relaxed atmosphere... HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"Like to try BBQ from different places and Fox Smokehouse was so good I wanted to get a to go order. Had the Brisket which was delicious with the Mac & Cheese. Staff was very friendly and owner stopped by table.  After trip to Hoover Dam this place is must stop."}
{"text":"Food was freaking rock solid.  My brisket and chicken sliders were really good and the mac 'n cheese was delicious.  All of us lover our food.   My daughter raved about her ribs as did my wife.   Son had the chicken fingers which were just that."}
{"text":"Better eating through social media! 5 stars for a reason! Dam good BBQ not far from the Hoover Dam."}
{"text":"Love, love ,love, it here.  When we come to town, this is the first stop.  This time I could barely empty the car before getting in to get here.  The food is amazing. If your in town, come by for sure. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ hands down within 200+ miles!!!! Thanks for the great meal, try the ribs, brisket, Mac and cheese, and beans!!!! We will be back, thanks again!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!  The staff were very friendly and helpful.  I had the combo #1 with ribs and mac and cheese.  The spicy sauce on the ribs was right on point, just enough spice but not too much!  the rest of my party really loved their food also,  including the porky sandwich and the chicken wings.   I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Outstanding experience!  We did the sampler and loved everything. I'm not a big meat eater but the ribs were to die for. Definitely recommend here to friends. The service was great and the proprietors were extremely nice and friendly."}
{"text":"3 dollar pitchers of PBR and amazing BBQ food after our trek to the Arizona Hotsprings! Great place to end the day with very reasonable prices and amazing service! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Okay, if you see my check-in list you will see that I get around. I've been to countless BBQ joints and I have to set this one hit's hard on perfection. If you're within 100 miles of this place just go there!

Based on our experience with the Ribs, Cowboy Beans, Corn Bread, they're spot on. These are the best ribs I've come across to date. Meaty, moist, beyond tender. The best part is the do remove from the bone very easily, but not mushy falling off the bone. The Cowboy Beans were well prepared with specks and chunks of meat. It is a good thick sauce but not mush. Corn Bread was on the sweet side which stands up to the BBQ sauces well. Crumbled into the Cowboy Beans and you've got a meal!

The owner brought out samples of the Brisket and Bratwurst. The Brisket was very tender and very moist with a great touch of flavor. Not over done with spices, you can actually taste the beef. The Bratwurst was moist and well marbled. It's spice, again, isn't over done.

Kudos to this place and can't wait until my travels bring me within range again!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty, good prices, and friendly service.

The advertised \"Hot buttered cornbread\" was refrigerator cold (as was the butter). The deserts tasted like something that Mom would have made back in the 70's. Mom is a terrible cook. 

But I'll be back for the main course - good basic barbeque served in a family-friendly environment."}
{"text":"This place is really good. The BBQ taste amazing and is a very good price for the quality. I usually get the pulled pork sandwich with peppers, col slaw, and onion, or I will get a 2 meat 1 side combo with brisket, ribs, or tri-tip with a side of cowboy fries. They also have very good jerky. It's a little costly, but it's very good. They are very nice and friendly. They will accommodate to you. I live in boulder city and there is not much to eat out here so this is the new best place."}
{"text":"Great BBQ joint in Boulder City. Wish they were open 24/7 or a little later. Been here a couple time and would recommend the ribs and the mac n' cheese (spicy). Got it to go and was still delicious. The brisket was ok. Also I have had their burger with chili fries on the side and they are BBQ delights. The Fox team has done a great job with making this a true top restaurant in BC. Definitely a good excuse to come out here. The place is a little hidden behind a shopping center on the main drag but definitely not a place you want to pass up."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Not sure how I missed this place! They have some of the best smoked chicken I have tasted! Makes sure to get the beans, there incredible. Great staff! Great vibe!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Friendly staff, scrumptious BBQ. A winner all the way around. Will definitely be back. They also cater."}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem on the way to Las Vegas airport when driving from Grand Canyon. Great bbq spot. Mac and cheese was awesome. Ribs and bbq sauce was equally as good. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Ok, the food was AMAZING!  But what really seals the deal with this place, the people working there.  Super friendly!  The minute I walked up to the counter and said \"OK, were tourists, tell me what we should order\" She was so happy to have us there, gave wonderful advice on what to order, and deservingly so, shared with us the award they had just won for Best Ribs in Las Vegas!  We ordered the #4: 2 meats, 2 sides, and added half rack ribs.  Brisket was so tender and flavorful.  Pulled pork... juicy and delicious. The RIBs are WINNERS and fall off the bone!  As for the sides, Mac and Cheese to die for and the beans... amazing!  This is one place you MUST visit in you are ever in the neighborhood!!!"}
{"text":"Brisket was one of the best I've had...despite being busy, friendly and prompt service. Always worth the risk trying the hole in the wall but this one paid off!"}
{"text":"Just moved here from Georgia and finally found an authentic smokehouse that I missed from living in the South.All the staff make you feel right at home and are genuinely friendly.Pulled pork is award winning."}
{"text":"I love finding new places.  Saw a tiny sign \"GREAT BBQ\" and curiosity paid off!  The place was very casual and very clean! The staff were extremely nice.  The food was delicious.  We tried the ribs, brisket & tri-trip combo.  Everything was tender, juicy, & well yummy!! Happy with everything, we ordered pulled pork sandwiches with our huge blueberry cheesecake and caramel custard cup to go!! I'm not from Boulder City but this must be a local secret!!"}
{"text":"Favorite bbq spot ever!!!  Owners are awesome people!  Worth the drive if you don't already live in Boulder City NV."}
{"text":"Found this place after we visited Hoover Dam and thank goodness! It was absolutely delicious!
We had ribs, beef brisket, Mac & cheese , baked potato and fries! All amazing , we were so full and had enough for leftovers, yaay!  
Best of all customer service was excellent!!!
Wish we lived closer so we can come more often!"}
{"text":"Best new food place in Boulder City in over 10 years and the Brisket is Amazing."}
{"text":"Great bbq! The smokehouse burger is my favorite!! If you're in Boulder City make sure you check this place out, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have ever had! Past this place so many times and didn't even know it was here! So happy we found it, the brisket is off the chain and the BBQ is is great! Friendly service!"}
{"text":"BEST BBQ ive ever had!!!! Brisket was delicious, my sister let me try her ribs and that was just wow!!!! Thank god i live 45 min away otherwise id be in a lot of trouble lol The customer service was a 5 star!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ! I've had some of the best in Texas, North Carolina and Kansas City, and it stacks up. Outstanding sides as well!"}
{"text":"Amazing home style sides which complement Dans tender delicious bbq meats. Staff is very accommodating and on it whether your eat in or get take out. Superb value for quality vs money spent. We go back regularly.  Definitely a B.C. highlight"}
{"text":"Although we modified our entrees to have the pickles on the side and they came on our sandwiches, the service could not have been better. Jacqueline confirmed that we weren't driving before serving us two margaritas and a pitcher, and the spicy barbecue is definitely the way to go. The sliders are not sliders. They are full sandwiches, easily split between two of us. We did not split one meal, though. The two of us were the perfect amount of uncomfortably stuffed after our two sandwiches; they were delicious."}
{"text":"We have been here twice since it opened.  First time was great.  Really good ribs, mac and cheese was really good.   

The second trip we got home and found we were missing part of our order.  Went back to get it and they gave it to us with no trouble, which was great.  But when we started eating, the ribs were completely different from the first time.  They were completely covered in black pepper and inedible.  

We will try again, because we really WANT new business here in Boulder, but it was pretty bad."}
{"text":"Holy smokes where has this place been hiding all my life.   Amazing food. Service is great !!  Would drive all way from Vegas just to eat here."}
{"text":"Only been to Boulder City once (today), but I cannot imagine better food anywhere around!  Ribs, brisket, Mac, cowboy fries and Kelly's caramel apple custard.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! I'm a huge bbq fan! & I absolutely loved the smoked chicken. Corn bread was delicious almost like cake!! Brisket was not dry and had good flavor! Glad we came out here to try it from Vegas!
Yum!"}
{"text":"We get dinner here almost once a week now... Yes, it is THAT good!  We have had some order mix-ups, but they have always made up for it the next time. Portions are generous... 2 of us get the #4 combo, (under $20 even with tax) and if I add a small salad, we have enough left for lunch the next day. Our favorite meat is the chicken, but they are all good. The mac and cheese is baked with a little spicyness and amazing."}
{"text":"It was the first time there for the 4 of us. You walk into a small place, and the smell of smoked meats hits ya. I had the brisket and pulled pork with the fried okra. The table split a small Cowboys fries and we had a couple pitchers of PBR. The beer is VERY reasonable so that is a nice way to start the meal. The food was too much good food. We next time wouldn't get the cowboy fries. Or maybe just use that as a meal. The beans on it are very good. The fried okra was delicious! Really good!
The brisket was good, ample amount, but not a real smoke flavor. That would be the only negative I could see. A friend had the bratwurst, I tried a piece. It was smokey, and spicy and good. If you don't like spicy, don't get it.
We all had a good time.
Something that some of you might be concerned with, but we weren't, is that they serve plastic utensils. They are fine, all that is needed. So don't worry and just enjoy. Remember it is small so get there early for a seat. This was a Thursday evening and we got there at 5pm and most seats taken.
The service was wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Was greeted when we walked in the door with \"would you like to order a carry out?\"  No i really wanted to sit down and eat there.   The hostess waited at her stand while we sat to look over the menu. We then were expected to go to her to order-- she couldnt be bothered to walk over to us to take the order.  Would have been great to have something to drink while we waited but that's too much trouble too. Employees need to get out of there on time! So, SERVING isn't much of a priority here"}
{"text":"We came with two of our friends , there were four of us total. We decided to get the family meal for 8 to 10 people which gives you two slabs off ribs (yum), 2 1/2 lbs of any meat you want. We picked a lb of chicken, a lb of beef brisket and 1/2 lb of brat worst.
It is a great deal.
It gives you four family style sides, we chose the  Mac and cheese, cowboy beans, coleslaw and potato salad all of them are homemade. sweet rolls and butter. 

We had  two pitcher of beer one was 4 dollars ( cheap) and the other was 6 dollars.( still cheap)Two desserts and we were full when we left.

The only complaint I have is that the sides are too small.  I felt that we really had just enough sides for 4 people not 8 to 10.  

We have been there twice and will return. Amazing BBQ. 
When you walk in you smell the smoke from the meat.

I will spread the word about his great quality of food. 
Nice road trip for people in the west.  Worth the drive. 

The owner was there and we talked with him , very accommodating and his staff is very friendly. Really nice hidden treasure."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The ribs just melt in your mouth. FOX knows how to cook BBQ!!!! The mac n cheese is amazing and the BEANS! Get the beans! Will be back my next time!"}
{"text":"4 people, at opposite ends of the valley, recommended this place. Obviously I just assumed, people in Vegas don't know BBQ.                                                                     We could could smell the smoke from a block away. It was amazing. Inside, we were greater by every server. ( got to love the Boulder City accent. We could sit anywhere, so obviously, we chose a table for 6! Our server was fantastic! Even the table next to us loved her. She was engaging without being fake. It said Jacqueline on the receipt. She's a younger woman with green tinged hair and a ball cap.  My husband and I shared 2 beers,  BBQ wings with fries, and a 2 meat combo with mac and cheese. We chose brisket and ribs. First off, I'm a fan of the saucy mac and cheese. It had green chilis and didn't taste like it had been sitting for weeks. The brisket was amazing! I'm used to BBQ places serving dry and stringy brisket. This was still juicy. I also appreciate that they don't baste their meat in sauce. Sauce hides bad meat. If I want sauce, I'll add it myself. Their sauce is delicious, by the way. Ribs were good but I'll be getting a pound of brisket next time. Our wings were also good but the brisket! If you want to get toasted at 11 am they had real cheap beer. Draft was a buck. Even my Languanitas was only 3.50$. It San Fran it would be at least 6. We will most definitely be back. Probably tomorrow."}
{"text":"Burnt ends will literally bring tears to your eyes, they're that good. Mac & cheese is fantastic, real homemade flavor. And the fried okra is perfect. Five stars all around!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for a bite after visiting the dam!  $3 pitchers of PBR,  \"sliders\" the size of most places regular portions, and the best French fry seasoning ever, make it worth the stop.  Then add in some of the best smoked meats I've had out west."}
{"text":"Went here after reading reviews on Yelp, best BBQ ever! We tried a couple of different pulled pork sandwiches and the burnt ends, sides of Mac, potato salad, beans. Cherry cobbler for dessert. All perfect. Wait staff extremely friendly, a great find. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"hi, went here for lunch on 6-18-15. went to Boulder city for an appt, 
, i thought there would be no good food in boulder.... Whoa!!      i was wrong, was recommended to Foxs, we ordered:  tri tip sandwich, brisket sandwich, mac and cheese, bakes beans, coleslaw.... everything bite was a ten  !!   the bread he uses is delicious Texas toast, grilled perfectly, the tri tip absolutely delicious, the brisket was tender, flavorful and his barbecue sauce is the best in the west !! !! !!   tangy , fresh, and the hot, just the perfect amount of heat . the mac n cheese , ooey, gooey, cheesy, green chiles, just delicious home cooked texture and flavor.  the baked beans were so yummy i ate 3 bowls, i love beans and i love brisket those two are better that any barbecue place in Las Vegas, by far.  Foxs also won a BARBECUE CHAMPIONSHIP in Vegas a couple of weekends ago!!!! the judges were 100% right !!! DELICIOUS BEYOND WORDS!!  
staff is super friendly and the ownwe came out , Dan, and introduced himself very classy guy !! thank you ,!!! :)  :)"}
{"text":"Food was to die for! Meat was very tender, fry seasoning was salty and sweet, cowboy beans were delicious! We went at just the right time because as we were leaving it started to get busy. The waiters and servers were friendly but we had to ask for waters a few times and they didn't check in on us too much. Just because it wasn't busy I feel like they should have been more tending to us but overall it was great food and we will be back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after visiting the Hoover Dam (I'm from MD).  The pulled pork sandwich was the best I've ever had.  I had the mild version and my husband had spicy.  Very nice staff - the owner even came out to check on us.  We'd be regulars if we lived in Boulder City!"}
{"text":"my boyfriend is a huge fan of the Mac and cheese and the daiquiri was awesome! what a doll we had waiting on us :) great place glad we found it"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Nice big portions. The sauce and the mac were a bit spicy for my taste, but otherwise excellent.  The meats were cooked perfectly and had a great smokey flavor. Service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"The best brisket...If you love it like I do..stop in on your way to the Dam or the Lake. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Food is good service not so much. Ordered by phone for pick up to avoid the slow service. Morgan collected our money and went in back. We assumed to get our order. Started doing prep work and didn't come back. Had to get other girl to go ask for our food."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent! Definitely upgrade to get the cornbread. 

It's nice to getaway from Las Vegas and experience friendly service. I will drive the 30 minutes to get my BBQ fix in."}
{"text":"The #1 indicator of a legitimate barbecue joint is their smoker- Fox's is parked right outside their door, the first thing you see when you roll up. Then you open your car door and get a lungful of that amazing barbecue smell, and you'll be hooked before you even take a bite. 

Meats here are sold in combos or by the pound- brisket and pulled pork are their specialty, and they're both good but I prefer my brisket a little more moist and a little more flavorful. What can I say, I was spoiled by decades in Texas. It's the best I've found outside of the Lone Star State though, accented perfectly by their own spicy and mild barbecue sauces. I was licking my fingers, no shame.
Even better than those two meats are their ribs- so tender they fall off the bone, high ratio of fat to meat but they make up for it with such good flavor. I could eat these every day and not get tired of them.

Their sides aren't to be forgotten, either: 5-cheese green chile mac, cowboy beans, or if you're feeling really indulgent: cowboy cheese fries. The beans though, are where it's at- they have brisket bits mixed in, with bacon, and spices that make the most perfectly-seasoned homemade Ranch Beans I think I've ever found, no joke. Bonus points for having Pyramid on draft, $6/pitcher, nothing goes better with barbecue than beer. Except maybe more barbecue, or a take-home bag of their jerky: $6/3oz bag, regular or spicy varieties.

A word about the pricing. When you go out to eat quality barbecue, it ain't cheap. That being said, many places charge a bit less... but they have crappy food. Go to TC's Rib Crib, if you'd rather have that type of experience.  Come here and plan to spend $12-18/person for the good stuff. It's worth it.
And hey, they have a check-in offer for a free dessert, so that saves you like $5. But IMO, if you're doing barbecue right, you don't have room for dessert afterward. Did not redeem mine, but appreciate that it's offered!"}
{"text":"Delicious brisket and pulled pork combined with jalapeño Mac and cheese with buttery corn bread gives Fox Smokehouse BBQ an easy 5 stars.  Add in their super friendly customer service and you have a perfect experience."}
{"text":"Great food. Had the brisket and also the smoked turkey , both amazing choices. We also had a chance to meet the owner who was very welcoming and friendly.  Favorite thing was the Brisket."}
{"text":"Wow what a drive I live in the north west and drove over 45 minutes to get here for my grand fathers birthday and wow what a place. Ribs are fall off the bone amazing brisket you can cut with a fork cowboy beans oh my God and mac and cheese I can't say it enough amazing amazing amazing. Services is so good very friendly and on point glasses never win empty. you must make the drive and try it."}
{"text":"It is my first time and the food was great!!!   Believe the hype as the reviews have said.   I'm not even a big smokehouse fan but I can eat this again!!   I'm so glad I came!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!!! We live in Henderson and have been going At least once a week since we found the place! The food is the best BBQ I've had - the staff is incredibly nice and the prices are affordable and the portions are big! Everything we have tried has been outstanding! If you are in or around Boulder City this is a must go to!"}
{"text":"It's a good sign when it smells really good when you open the door and step in here! They got a nice little dining area set up too. Staff is really nice and welcoming.  I like the menu options they offer. Ribs,Brisket, Pulled Pork, Tri-tip, Bratwurst. 

All the sandwiches here come with a side. Some of the sides offered, macNcheese, cowboy beans, potato salad.  Combo meals choice of meat ,sides and Hawaiian dinner roll. Prices are affordable. Although the larger combo meals I thought were a tad pricey. Of course I elected to get the pricey combo the 2 meat and 2 sides for $18 which was quite a jump in price from the 1 meat 1 side combo going for $10. But Tita was starving! 

So ribs and pulled pork for me. Beef Brisket for Mr. B.  My order was okay tasting.Texture wise, it's tender and fall off the bone. Better meat quality than some other places Ive visited. But it's a different spice rub and flavor profile used here than my favorite bbq joint..  I did like the ribs better though than the pulled pork. The pulled pork has a different smoky flavor. That could be a good thing though. That's what sets this place apart from other places we've been to. My other minor gripe was that the Beef Brisket looked overcooked and Mr. B confirmed and said yes it was a little dry. 

The sides were a winner with both of us. Love the Mac n Cheese , the cowboy beans is a must. Thanks for the complimentary sample of it!  Pabst beer for $1 it says on the front door. 

It's a close 4 stars for me. I'm just still loyal to my old bbq place I use to go to.  Im trying hard to keep an open mind and not compare my fave place which closed down.  But GUESS WHAT??  Mr. B. LIKES this place BETTER than RS in LV! Said he would rate this place 4 stars...but its not his review. Just thought I should mention it here for those bbq fanboys! 

More than likely we'll return! It's nearby and we're all about supporting owner operated local businesses."}
{"text":"In a few words, everything every other reviewer has stated is true.

This barbecue is probably some of the best I have ever eaten. The ribs literally fall off the bone when you shake them. Tender and tasty and extremely reasonably priced.  Staff could not be any nicer and it is truly an out-of-the-way place to visit to experience really good barbecue."}
{"text":"HAVE MERCY! This is by far the best BBQ around town. I don't typically take my Real Estate clients to places like this BUT the food is just too good not to! Best place to celebrate opening or closing Escrow!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Brisket and Mac and cheese at a good price.  Memorable eating, will put this in my Boulder City top ten restaurant list!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ! Definitely love the brisket and cowboy fries! Great prices, friendly staff and customer service. Will come again!!!"}
{"text":"This place serves the best BBQ food ever...hands down!!! Deserving of 6 STARS!! They catered my niece's wedding and did an amazing job! I would recommend them for any catered event. The tri-tip was super moist, and just fell apart. The homemade beans with celery were out of this world - and not full of sugar like most places. Even the cesar salad with fresh grated cheese was really good. I didn't try it, but everyone liked the mac & cheese also. You can tell the owners pride themselves on quality food from the heart; you can taste it in every bite. If you haven't been on the Food Network yet (like Guy's DDD's), it's time! Thank you, Kelly & Dan, for caring about what you do...and sharing it with us!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place with amazing people working there!! I have so many people who are always recommending people to eat here as I do! The owners as well as their daughter who works there are so nice & make you feel very welcome! The small town, family owned & operated, GREATEST BBQ joint around!"}
{"text":"This was hands down the highlight of our day! Lisa greeted us at the door, the cooks came out and said hello and once I checked in with Yelp the owner called me at his shop and asked for me by my name on the telephone to tell me thank you for coming in. Excellent customer service! the brisket was absolutely absolutely melt in your mouth amazing, they have a apple pie dessert that won awards with a custard that is sinful. We loved everything about it... especially the macaroni and cheese and the cowboy beans, so incredible. You absolutely have to go here and try this wonderful barbecue hidden treasure in Boulder City."}
{"text":"If you're a bbq fan this place is must stop if you're coming through Boulder City. My mouth was drooling from the bbq smell before I got to the door. The ribs and the brisket are the best. Be sure to get the mac and cheese as well. Price is very affordable."}
{"text":"This is the best meat, beans, Mac & Cheese and service with a smile I have ever eaten at.  Dan Fox took time out to chat with Pam & I. Great attitude and great person whom we will be seeing many more times.  Prices were very readable as well.  They're open until they run out of meat or 7:00 pm, whichever comes first"}
{"text":"We happened upon this gem by accident. We are so glad!! My hubby is a BBQ judge and he was enthralled. Tender, flavorful, great smoky flavor and quick service. Probably the best mac and cheese I've ever had with a wonderful jalapeno flavor. They are apparently known for their ribs and brisket, award winning! Definitely the place to come if you're in the area or sightseeing the Hoover dam."}
{"text":"After reading all the positive reviews on Fox Smokehouse in Boulder City, we decided to give it a try. Very, very disappointing. I ordered the sliced brisket and ribs. Fried okra and mac and cheese as sides. Also the warm cornbread. The sweet tea and okra were good but that's all. The brisket was not brisket, It was roast!! I was very disappointed with the ribs as well. They do not have good flavor. The mac and cheese was very sticky, but not in a cheesy kind of way. It was just weird. The warm cornbread was served cold. My wife ordered burnt ends. Very disappointing as well. $50 for a meal for two. Not again. I've eaten bad BBQ before, but this is the first time that I didn't finish the meat. On a positive note, our waitress rocked!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! BBQ Tri-tip sandwich on Texas toast with a little butter, red onion & bbq sauce. Sweet potato fries were really good and cooked perfectly crunchy.
Very nice, friendly & efficient wait staff."}
{"text":"Randomly stopped by after our visit to the Hoover Dam and omg the food is delicious! We're huge on barbecue and the owner definitely knows what he's doing! He even stopped by to greet us which is always definitely a sign that he really cares. Our server Lisa was so friendly and accommodating too! The only thing that's stopping us from coming back here anytime soon is that we live in Riverside, Ca but we would recommend this place to anyone looking for amazing food and great service!"}
{"text":"Who would think that the best ribs in southern Nevada could be found in a small informal barbecue restaurant off the beaten path in Boulder City? We were in town for the film festival and wanted to get a relatively quick informal dinner before heading back to Vegas. We checked out the yelp reviews for all of the restaurants within a couple of miles. Fox BBQ came up with a five star review and we wanted to give it a try. Boy we were rewarded. I had a half rack of the St. Louis ribs and my wife had one of their hamburgers. We shared a side of the sweet potato fries. The ribs were the meatiest ribs that I have ever seen. Fall off the bone tender. I added a little bit of the regular barbecue sauce (A little afraid of the hotter stuff). Delish!!! My wife rated the hamburger as excellent. And they brought the sweet potato fries extra crispy just as we ordered. Perfection. This is definitely my go to place for dinner when I am in Boulder city. In fact, it is worth the 30 minute drive for me to go there the next time I feel like having ribs (rather than one of the chain restaurant rib places closer to my house)."}
{"text":"I waited a day before writing this review because I wanted to make sure this really was the best bbq I've ever had. It is at least the best that I've had in years. I got the Smokehouse burger which has Angus beef and brisket in a patty with all the fixins. Family had ribs, brisket, smoked chicken and cowboy beans. The bbq masters didn't miss a beat. Every bite is full of flavor and nothing was too wet or dry. I wish this place were close to my house so I could go there all the time!"}
{"text":"On our way from Grand Canyon to Las Vegas we found this hidden gem! Everything was delicious! The man n cheese is the best and the staff is very frienfdly."}
{"text":"Real bbq, really great food! The cornbread is the best I've ever had & every meat we tried was smokey & moist. Support your local business & get in here. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Combo #4 with Mac n cheese and cowboy fries, well worth the upgrade.  And a half a rack. I had to try the best ribs in vegas. Oh, and dollar PBR's on draft"}
{"text":"So yummy. Great service! Family friendly. Highly recommend. 1st time here not the last. Hidden treasure."}
{"text":"The food earned four stars.  Not impressed, look at my other reviews.  The service there earns no stars.

I recommend you order their specialities!

A quaint local restaurant patronized by locals & not the mass of Hoover Dam tourists.  Fox Smokehouse BBQ earns its existence by providing quality meals & not gimmicks, a famous name, or locale.  However their service fails.  

It took an unreasonable amount of time for our tables server to appear, the people seated across from us arrived 5-10 minutes after we sat down & received their food 10 minutes before we did. Our hipster millineal server also brought our food out before the drinks & rushed off before I could ask for utensils.  The food earned four stars but the server earned the tip I left. 

It's not a tablecloth fine dining cafe, but what BBQ place is."}
{"text":"Wow, no wonder this place has 5 stars. Stopped for lunch on the way back to Vegas from seeing the Hoover Dam - and the food was amazing. Probably the best mac & cheese and sweet potato fries I've ever had, and the ribs were perfect. Definite winner."}
{"text":"Yummy food, great beer choice, fast service, friendly wait staff! This place was a true find! The cobbler was delicious and HUGE serving!"}
{"text":"While on a family excursion to the Hoover Dam we stumbled upon this AMAZING bbq place, and had the best service from Facio. The only thing better than the food was the service. Would highly recommend the bbq burnt ends, the #2 with macaroni & okra, and the ribs!! Definitely a Boulder City stop sign!!!"}
{"text":"Great bbq!! We've eaten bbq all over the country and this is one of our favorites. The pulled pork is divine! The ribs just fall apart they're so tender. The coleslaw is great. Loved the bbq beans!!!! Great potato salad. Everything we tried was so awesome!!! Your hair and clothes will smell like bbq smoke until you wash them, which makes you want to go again. Lol! Definitely worth your time and money. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Omg I'm from Cali just moved here a year ago I work down the street a VOA OMG THE FOOD AT THE FOX was amazing amazing amazing I have no complaints what so ever the food was so freaking good I would go there all the time and tell everyone about what I had amazing"}
{"text":"Our family had such a great time. The food was fabulous the staff was great and friendly. Felt like home. Will be headed back!!"}
{"text":"Yum!

Just seeing the name made my mouth water. We stopped here on the way back from the Hoover Dam mainly because of the amount of reviews it had and still a 5* place. That is some serious love!

We didn't go wrong here that is certain! I had the pulled pork sandwich and mac and cheese as a side. I wish I ordered two helpings of the mac and cheese!

Honest to God, they have the best mac and cheese I have ever had in my life (including from areas such as all the Southeast, Portland, Seattle, LA....)!

The waitress was spot on and knew what she was doing, They had a free dessert for checking in and holy cow the cheese cake was phenomenal!

I may just book a trip to Vegas just to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious meal here tonight.  I recommend the brisket and cowboy beans. Service was excellent! Free dessert with check in!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ! The best I have had so far! The ribs were awesome. And the home made Mac n cheese was just right... Great service."}
{"text":"This place was really Good. Friendly staff, unique restaurant with a varied menu. I'm always open for new BBQ and getting a chance to check this place out was fun. They use hickory smoke and a really simple rub on their meat. The meat wasn't overly Smokey and the flavor from the smoke wasn't as prominent as some top tier BBQ places. 

I got the 2 meat plate with Pork Ribs, Brisket, corn bread and Mac & cheese. The mac&cheese was good. The corn bread was sweeter than most which was good and the size of the slice of cornbread was good for the price. 

The ribs had a pretty simple rub. They were smoked perfectly. Tender enough to pull the bone clean. They did need an extra drizzle of sauce but the ribs were delicious.

The brisket I wasn't that into. It had a typical salt and pepper rub and it really let the meat shine. The brisket shredded too easily. Like it was over cooked. The bark wasn't anything impressive, I think the bark lacked the sugar needed to really be deep and rich. 

Overall this is right up there with the best BBQ in southern Nevada. I think it would be a great stop for those visiting the Hoover Damn or headed into Las Vegas. I'll definitely go back and was well worth the drive from Henderson. 

I eat a lot of bbq. I don't know if this is one of the top 5 BBQ places I've been, but it is certainly top 15. $20 before tip for a good portion of BBQ, a side and some bread was well worth it. Look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I drive in to Boulder City to make my deliveries every week and then I head back to Las Vegas. I decided to try this place after asking some locals about great food spots in B.C. At one of my stops several ladies mentioned how good this place is and that they sell out of their bbq. I had to try this place to see what everyone was raving about and I'm glad I did. The pulled pork sandwich is now my new favorite thing as the meat is like butter so tender and flavorful. This sandwich is the best pulled pork I have ever eaten. The staff is so friendly and they really go out of their way to make you feel at home. This week I tried the two item combo in which I got the ribs and brisket. OMG fall off the bone delicious and smokin ribs and tender brisket I have had in a long time. I strongly reccommend this place for anyone that loves top end bbq. This place is a gem for those looking to satisfy their craving for good ol fashion bbq and they have my stamp of approval. You will fall in love with their food from the start. I promise you that!!"}
{"text":"Quick trip to Boulder City for dinner and found this place. So glad we did. Amazing BBQ and the staff was super friendly. It was busy but it didn't affect service; our drinks never went empty. Hidden gem for sure!"}
{"text":"Went in here earlier today by chance when I was going to grab a burger at the Jack in the box but saw a sign that said barbeque and thought we should check it out.

We got half a rock of ribs and a cheese steak sandwich. Both were excellent, so were cowboy fries. 

The staff were great too. The two young ladies were friendly, polite and helpful. We stood and chatted for a while, while buying a tshirt. The owner came out and chatted for a minute too."}
{"text":"Hidden little gem! Excellent bbq! Chicken and pulled pork sandwhiches were very tasty. Bbq sauces were excellent. Very friendly and helpful wait staff. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very good food- had a chicken combo with beans and cornbread. Chicken was fantastic, very tender, with a great smoky flavor. Cowboy beans were also good, with chunks of peppers and onions, and the cole slaw was above average with a nice flavor \"kick\". Would only take off 1/2 star for rather skimpy meat potions. The sides were larger than the main course, and could've been traded for a bit more BBQ!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and eat here! Best BBQ I have ever had! Came with friends and the four of us got cowboy French fries, bratwurst, ribs, Philly cheesesteak, brisket, chicken, and corn bread. Each and every one of us was happier than the last and I don't even know how that's possible. We also got $3 pitcher of PBR, and our friend purchased a bottle of their jalapeño hot sauce he enjoyed it so much. Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!  The barbecued meats are full of smokiness.  The food came out quick and the service was nice.  The pulled pork sliders were the groups favorite, with a runner up being the Hawaiian barbecue chicken sandwich coming a close second.  The veggie burger was good and I personally like the brisket philly.  If you like beans, give the cowboy beans a shot, there are spicy and explosive with flavor."}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp when I was looking for restaurants near the Hoover Dam. I didn't expect it to be tucked away on a tiny street. This is definitely a place for locals. I saw many people taking a break from cycling and stopping in with their bike gear.

We got a Caesar Salad and a combo (two meats, one side, one bread roll) to share. It was plenty of food and very good. There wasn't too much dressing on the salad. It was perfectly balanced and not goopy. The ribs were meaty and packed with flavor. Didn't need too much bbq sauce. The brisket could have been a little more tender IMO but they were still good. We upgraded to Cowboy Cheese Fries and they rounded out the meal nicely. 

We were satisfied for lunch and didn't break the bank. Fox Smokehouse Bbq was a nice break from restaurants on the Vegas Strip and definitely made the day trip to Hoover Dam worth it."}
{"text":"We just had visited the Hoover Dam and we're looking for a place to eat in Boulder City. I opened up my Yelp app and found this place. It is off the beaten path in a Industrial area. There's only street parking. But there's plenty of it. It was a storefront building with a barbecue and a smoker out front. We walked inside and felt nice and cozy. I love the decor and there were four TVs on the wall with football on. They served various types of beer on tap. All of the waitresses were very helpful. They also work as a team they would all come to the table and make sure your drink was never empty. My wife had the brisket tacos my daughter had the pulled pork sandwich and I had the brisket sandwich. The brisket sandwich was on Texas toast and I had the macaroni and cheese as a side. I also tried my daughter's pulled pork sandwich it was good but I preferred the brisket. The mac and cheese and cowboy beans are also very good sides. All was very good. The owner was out talking with his customers . He's very attentive as well"}
{"text":"We were visiting the Hoover Dam from Chicago, and stopped at Fox's on the way back to Vegas. Boy, are we glad we chose this place. Great staff and great food. 

I had the teriyaki wings with some of the homemade BBQ sauce. I loved them. They were meaty and sweet. For a side, I chose the beans, which were really unique. Think brisket meets chili meets baked beans. My dad had the brisket, which was tender, flavorful, and had the perfect amount of char. But above all, the staff was the cherry on top. They were all sweet as sweet can be, and the owner was super personable. This is the place to stop."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We came here with our friends and we all loved our food. I had the philly, cowboy fries and cornbread and it was delicious! I used to live in Kansas city and now live in Cali and it's so hard to find good barbecue, so I really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Yum, highly recommended. The waitress, Jacqueline was a treat as well. 
We had the combo plate (brisket & ribs) with the cowboy beans. 
If you are craving bbq in Boulder City don't hesitate to try Fox!"}
{"text":"What's my mantra? Shop LOCAL. Fox's is exactly that. It's a great little BBQ place owned by people who live in the community.

I try to get out to Boulder City whenever possible. I really love it there. BC has a number of good restaurants, but I wanted to try something new. I also wanted to go somewhere that it's relatively Paleo friendly. After a search on Yelp, I found Fox's. The reviews were good, so I had to try it.

Three of us went at about 5pm on a weekday. There was one other group there. We were grated by the nicest lady working the counter. She explained how each of the meats were prepared. It all sounded great. We ended up sharing ribs, pulled pork, and a few sides. Everything was top-notch. The meat was so moist, the sauce was not needed. The sides were great too.

Also... I checked in on Yelp and received a free dessert: a huge piece of cheesecake which my wife loved.

You've gotta check this place out of you're in BC."}
{"text":"This place is THE BOMB! Can't remember the last time I've had ribs this good outside of my home. Best ribs in Vegas! They melt in your mouth and fall right off the bone! The brisket and pork was moist, tender and delicious too. The beans, coleslaw and mac & cheese sides were super yummy! I will definitely be back! Thank You so much Fox Smokehouse!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here.   A must stop for lunch or dinner if you are going to/from Hoover Dam/Las Vegas.   
We stopped for lunch on the way back from Hoover Dam (Going back to Vegas).    Ribs and Brisket with Beans...  WOW!    I can't say enough about them.    Next time I am in Vegas...  I will be driving out to Fox Smokehouse just to get BBQ.    Just amazing.    The staff is also amazingly friendly."}
{"text":"The best place to eat ever! My whole family and I love this place! As a vegetarian I wasnt too thrilled the first time my parents brought me here. Thinking I would just get french fries the waitress at the time told me to not worry they have something for me. It was Mac n cheese tacos! They are amazing and I have been going there for the last 2 years! Mel and the staff there are wonderful. I have spent the last two birthdays there and they really go out of their way to make you feel special. This place is a must !"}
{"text":"WOW!! I found this place in Yelp and after reading the reviews decided to try it out. I ordered the combo with Brisket and Pulled Pork with Mac and Cheese. It was absolutely amazing!! The meat was tender and just fell apart with BBQ sauce that is on point. I then ordered the caramel apple custard parfait which was to die for. If I was a local I would go here all the time. I will definitely come back here if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"I have my doubts when I see a 5 star 400+ review restaurant, but this BBQ joint checks out! We came here on a Sunday afternoon, and there was no wait for a table of 6. We had skipped lunch and we're starving, so we definitely ordered a lot more food than we could eat. They only offer beef ribs Friday-Sunday, so they ran out by the time we got there. They also said you can call ahead of time to reserve it.

Full rack of ribs: hands down best ribs I've had in town. You have to at least try one or two. The meat is fall off the bone, and you can put as little or as much homemade BBQ sauce on your own. 

Burnt ends: so crispy and fatty and melt in your mouth delicious. Would definitely get this again

Beef brisket sandwich: got it with all the toppings and it was delicious. The best part about the sandwich was the Texas toast which was so light and buttery. The brisket was good, but I've had better before. I'd prefer it cut up more against the grain so that it wouldn't be as dry. Nevertheless, still delicious.

Tri tip sandwich: got it with the toppings but was kind of bare. I think it needed more tri tip, especially compared to the brisket which is piled high. Probably wouldn't get this again, but the tri tip was really tender 

Mac and cheese: really delicious, perfect pair with BBQ

Cornbread: you can order as an add on to your dish, really fluffy and perfect

Fried okra: small nuggets of okra fried to perfection. Tastes almost like zucchini to me, and not slimy at all

Cowboy fries: could do without this one. Nacho cheese with beans on top of fries. The beans were cooked nicely and had good flavor. I think we were just too full to eat the rest"}
{"text":"Brisket, bratwurst, ribs, and pulled pork - YUMMY! Great place to stop before or after a tour at Hoover Dam and on the way back to Vegas. Sweet potato fries and cowboy beans are a must!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Ribs and veggie burger were delish! Our sides were fried okra, fries, cole slaw, and mac n cheese, which were nice choices. Corn bread was so-so and brisket was dry. I would come back again if I ever find myself in Boulder City :)"}
{"text":"No question, excellent BBQ.  However, I am always wary  of a restaurant that has their menu on a chalkboard.  Their prices can vary every week and sometimes do just that.   Been there three times and the price of a sandwich has been higher each time.  Now,  $11 for two pieces of bread, several slices of smoked tri-tip, and a side of potato salad is just too high for this customer.  They can probably get those prices from tourists,  but from the locals in BC, I doubt it.  In thirty years, I have seen many good restaurants, like the Smokehouse, come and go in BC because they can't build a local customer base and have to depend  on the tourist trade for survival.
Good Luck, Kelly"}
{"text":"So glad to live up the road from such a yummy place! The people are cool and the menu is great!  The brisket is awesome! Oh! And the macaroni and cheese is perfection!"}
{"text":"The ribs, mac n cheese, and fried okra were bomb! The ribs were fall-off-the-bone and there were two types of bbq sauce available (spicy and regular). The mac n cheese had a subtle spice blend added to it which made it unique. The fried okra was perfect and I only wish it was served with a homemade ranch dip. We also ordered brisket but it was was a little dry for my liking. The cornbread was pretty good but tasted like a cross between cornbread and yellow cake. Tasted good but not like any other cornbread I'd ever had."}
{"text":"Holy crap where have you been all my life? I'm new to the BC area and never would have known about this place if someone hadn't told me about it. Food was amazing, and so was the staff. This will definitely be a weekly stop for me."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this place and since we were on our way to Willow Beach, decided to finally try it! I ordered the brisket and bbq chicken. Now I am a big fan of Lucille's BBQ, especially their BBQ chicken and so when I tried the BBQ chicken at Fox', I was expecting something similar. Totally different! The chicken (thighs I believe) were pretty juicy and has a curry kick in it. It's different but I dig it. It wasnt a traditional bbq sauce type of chicken. If you dont mind some curry flavor then go for if. The brisket was absolutely delicious, very moist, fall out of the bone type of meat. Definitely my favorite place if we ever pass by Boulder City again. Would I drive the 45 mins from Vegas? Probably not. I'd still prefer Lucille's!"}
{"text":"If you are visiting the Hoover Dam, make this your next stop. The Cowboy Beans are indescribably good. The ribs are meaty and flavourful."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! A hidden gem in Boulder city worth the short drive. Enjoy looking at a very nice trophy from a BBQ competition that they have won!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Went here after a day boating in the lake and it hit the spot. Delicious sweet tea and $1 PBR... can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Came here after taking the kids on the train.  Found it on yelp and it sounded good.  It was a little bit off the beaten path,  but there were some road side signs directing you.  As we pulled up, you could already smell that BBQ smell.  They had a nice variety of options of meats that could be done as a sandwich or combo platter.  I noticed a sign above the register advertising a turkey breast sandwich.  Since I'm not super crazy about BBQ (my hubby is a fan) I thought that would be a great choice for me and my son who is super picky.   They were really nice and let us choose corn bread for a side even though it wasn't an actual choice.  My husband and daughter shared a Tri-tip sandwich.  OMG. The turkey was AMAZING! It was very juicy and great flavor.  Served on Texas toast that was perfectly toasted.  This was by far the best turkey I've had.  (Except maybe at my wedding when we had turkey cooked inside if a roasting pig). Hubby tried it and thought it was better than what he ordered.   The BBQ sauces were also fantastic.  I added a little of the mild to my sandwich.  The corn bread was also very good.  It was sweet and moist.  For dessert we cashed in on the free dessert for checking in on yelp. We selected the triple chocolate cake.  So yummy.  Very rich but delicious!  We will be back when we venture out to Boulder City again!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for family dinner while in Boulder City for the Christmas parade. The staff was extremely attentive, friendly and quick! The food was perfect size, fresh and a home cooking taste! They even have patio dinning. Can't beat the pitcher of beer price either! We will definitely return when in the area. Follow the Brisket BBQ signs off the Main Street, it's tucked just a block off the Main Street."}
{"text":"Ribs, brisket, Mac & cheese for combo #3!!  Best BBQ around!!  Triple D needs to get Guy's butt down here for some smoked butt!!"}
{"text":"Our 2nd visit, first being two years ago, at which time we complained about the squirtbottles of BBQ sauce being sticky. 
This time we ordered a pork taco, which was served plumb cold and we didn't eat it.  The chicken taco was ok.  
Also had a hamburger with BBQ beef mixed into the burger.  Kinda meh.  
Really like the people, they seem to be trying very hard."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!!!!! Great food great service!!!  The he brake was wonderful!  The Mac and cheese was the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Had the best brisket sandwich with the best sweet potato fries. My husband had a brisket burger that was good also. From the outside I really didn't expect to be so impressed with the bbq. We are definitely coming back since I haven't had barbecue as good since I was in Texas and that should give you an indication as to how good it was. Go, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I got the brisket and my boyfriend got the pulled pork. Both were absolutely amazing. Best cornbread I've ever had as well. Only complaint is the water was not good."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first time here this week. Decided to go with the sliders, 1 brisket and 1 pulled pork with the works on both and their spicy BBQ sauce. The brisket slider was my favorite! Meat was tender and not dry at all! Sauce was perfect and I enjoyed the addition of the pepperoncinis as well as the red onion which both gave it an extra kick. Ordered the Mac and cheese as my side which was also great. Pork was also very good but after that brisket nothing could top it. Enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff that stopped by to say hi to the regulars we were there with. Considered dessert after seeing the chocolate cake pictures but we were never asked or offered, our server just dropped off our check. So I guess that was out (minus 1 star for that). We will go back though and look forward to trying those brisket tacos that looked delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent service and excellent food!  We had a combo platter with brisket, ribs, cole slaw and macaroni & cheese. They had pyramid Hefeweizen on draft (3.50) which was surprising along with $1 PBRs and other beers to choose from. Servers were hopping and the place was busy. We got our check quickly. Eat here!  It really is worth 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Hands-down one of the best BBQ joints I've ever eaten at! Went by Yelp recommendation & the hubby & I were very pleased. Service was excellent! 

We split combo #4 by recommendation of the server - brisket, BBQ ribs, plus house-made potato salad & cowboy beans. Every mouthful was amazing! Will definitely come back next time we're out West!

Side note - we were also able to sample the mac & cheese, which was exceptional!"}
{"text":"Oh my!  This place is amazing!  Had the brisket and chicken combo.  Cooked to perfection.  Make sure you get the Mac n cheese.  It is to die for!  Has green chillies, not too spicy.    Loved the staff.  So friendly and always smiling.  Next vacation, I am definitely, coming back here."}
{"text":"We had to go to Boulder City so we thought we'd stop in somewhere to get a bite to eat. My boyfriend loves bbq and I saw great reviews for this place so we figured why not? 

We had high hopes for the place because it smelled amazing when you walked in the door. There were only a couple of tables of people, not real busy, but it was only a Thursday night. We were greeted pretty quick, but that's about all the good customer service we got. We ordered our food, got our food in a pretty reasonable time. After that, nothing. Nobody ever came back. We had no drinks half way through our meal. We wanted to order more, but not once did anyone ever come to check on us. We waited 20-30 minutes and then got up and asked for the check and left. 

Food alone, I would've given a 4-5 star review, easy. But with how bad our experience was with customer service, giving it a one star, I had to average out my rating. We were really excited that we found a place where the food was amazing, but I don't know if we'll ever go back now. Very disappointed in the service.

Quick review of the food. It was amazing. I got the chicken Teriyaki sandwich and he got the combo to try the brisket, brat, cowboy beans and Mac n Cheese. All were really good. Prices were $12-20. Not too bad."}
{"text":"Great little place with the feel of home.Food was delicious ribs chicken pulled pork were perfect not over smoked like some places.The side dishes were made with love not your typical mac n cheese and beans just the right touch of special ingredients. Staff was friendly made sure we were happy with everything and gave us tips on what to visit while we're in town.DONT HESITATE trust me you will walk away full and satisfied.Oh yeah we took dessert to go.very happy Michigan costumers!"}
{"text":"Recent new residents of Boulder City. Visiting friends joined us for lunch.  Food was awesome, ordered variety of meats w/sides for 4 people.  Plenty to eat and take home for later.  Will be our go-to place for smoked meats."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal. While this is an off the beaten path place, with plastic silverware and cups, it not a place to pass up! The ribs fell off the bone, the pulled pork was huge chunks and the brisket was mouth watering. Service was quick and nice. Would definitely come back next time through town."}
{"text":"Back here again! Chicken sandwich with macaroni and cheese for lunch. Delicious. Great service and cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was recommended by people I work with at the Wynn Las Vegas how staff from this area boasted about it, yes the meat is tender and tastes great but for the price its not worth it, I got 3 slices of brisket good job I chose that as I would have had one slice of brisket, My Hubby had the Mac and Cheese that looked greasy and old within 30 minutes of leaving he felt really ill and had to use a public bathroom, Fox smoke house is not the best place, I would go to the one in Green Valley Ranch as its 100% better than this one!"}
{"text":"Most tender brisket and pulled pork I can remember having anywhere. 

The sauce was fabulous, if you're near the Hoover Dam stop here and don't skip the caramel apple parfait dessert.

The near perfect reviews got us here, this review agrees."}
{"text":"We stopped here based on Yelpers' reviews, and boy were we glad we did! After missing it on the way back from the Grand Canyon, we stopped by after a trip to Hoover Dam, and our family had the family meal for up to 4. My husband, myself, and my 15 year old and 7 year old daughters were stuffed by the time we left and we didn't finish the brisket, Mac and cheese, or the beans--not because they weren't good...we just had so much great food. 

First off, usually when you have BBQ (or service period), it is good food or good service, but this place had both! The cooks in the back have us their opinion on what meats were the best to order for the day, and they were right on. The order taker was very efficient and friendly as well--with multiple people checking in with us multiple times.

Secondly, the flavors were great! My favorites were the ribs! Holy cow! They were tender and flavorful. The spicy sauce was yummy! The pulled pork was tender, but not gooey, and the brisket pretty much fell apart...though a little dry for my tastes. 

The sides are great...Mac and cheese smokey with a hint of jalapeño! The beans also had a great flavor with chunks of celery and meat! Mmmm!

Great food, great service...if only we lived closer...on second thought...it's probably better that we don't! :0)"}
{"text":"Stellar! I'll be back. Got to meet the owner & it felt like a family right away. I'm bringing my friend on Thursday so I can have a legit excuse to go twice in one week. :)"}
{"text":"Had the smokehouse burger today... Wow. Wife had the tacos... Wow. Thank you again for being consistent in your awesome bbq. It was my second visit. Every shop in the downtown area recommend Fox's Smokehouse for delicious bbq. Keep it up. We will be back."}
{"text":"Heard about Fox Smokehouse during a zip line adventure in Boulder City.  What a way to top off a great morning, GREAT BBQ.  This place is off the beaten path, but worth the effort to find it.  The people are really nice and friendly.  They helped us with what to get.  The food was quick, fresh and hot.  They did a great job of preparing the food.  Everything we had was awesome.
They are worth the drive...I will be back, often."}
{"text":"This is a top notch BBQ joint. Clean, polite/ fast service, and good food make this a must stop. 

For sides, we tackled the Mac and cheese, beans, and fries. All excellent, but special mention for the beans. They were the best I've ever had. 

The meat was also good. Ribs fell off the bone and were sauced appropriately. However, and here is where I just couldn't go five stars, the brisket was a bit dry. 

Make the stop. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I never leave reviews but I had to this time because that's how disappointed I just was with the food. Stopped by on the way back to Vegas after going to the Hoover Dam. Got a meal with a double order of ribs - one regular, one spicy. What kind of bbq meat has NO SAUCE? Not even a little bit. The \"spicy\" wasn't spicy at all. Once I finally got to my last regular rib, i pulled a LONG WHITE HAIR out my mouth after taking a bite!!!!!  They definitely use pepper jack cheese in the Mac n cheese which was disgusting. The potato salad has OLIVES & ONIONS... couldn't get past that to see what else. The \"cornbread\" just tastes like gritty vanilla cake (my bf liked that though so guess that works for some people). Would never recommend or eat there again. Only reason I give it 2 stars is because the service was friendly at least.......even though we would've been without all our sides if we hadn't checked the bag before we left smfh"}
{"text":"We found this restaurant while taking family out to see the Hoover Dam. The barbecue was delicious and the portion sizes were perfect for us. The owner came by to see how we were enjoying our meal. He was very friendly and gave us some advice about tours of the Hoover Dam. We also had a vegetarian in our group and he really enjoyed the veggie burger. We were able to find something on the menu to please everyone. They even let us order a kids burger for one of our pickier adult eaters. I would highly recommend Fox Smokehouse BBQ - great food, great atmosphere, great service."}
{"text":"Delicious variety of tender brisket, ribs and chicken. We added coleslaw, baked beans and mac & cheese and were not disappointed! The generous portions were served by a friendly, attentive staff. I was also impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant and the relaxed atmosphere. Great food & reasonable prices! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Wow.  A hidden gem that should be front & center.  Better than Lucille's (my previous favorite).  I've had a lot of bbq, the brisket is the most tender and moist I've ever had.  My only minor complaint is the iceberg lettuce in the salads instead of something greener."}
{"text":"Wow what a good place for BBQ! Thank goodness for friends who have good taste for food. It was worth the 25 minute drive from Las Vegas to Boulder City. We were greeted with a welcome smile of Dan Fox (Owner) and Lisa. It's a homestyle restaurant with a big personality and bold flavors. We ordered the family plate. It included cowboy beans filled with pieces of their BBQ meat, warm cheesy mac & cheese, a slab of bold smoky ribs with meat that falls off the bone, and tri-tip & brisket that melts in your mouth. Both their mild and spicy sauces were balanced with sweet and spicy flavors. We will make a return to Fox Smokehouse BBQ and, without a doubt, try other items in their menu and plan to bring back a few meals for friends."}
{"text":"Good, but not great. I had ribs and brisket with fries on the side. The ribs were four star material, but the brisket was so fatty I couldn't eat a third of it, it really dragged the meal down. The homemade BBQ sauce was very good, but I don't think anything could have saved my brisket. It wasn't just my order either a friend I was with had the same problem with their brisket. I'd like to give this place another try. It has so many good reviews, maybe I caught it on a bad day. As it stands though I can't give this place more than three stars."}
{"text":"The rib is one of the the best ribs I have ever had!!! So is the brisket!!! The homemade corn cake is outstanding!!! And I do want to know where they bought the caramel cheesecake!!! Wanna buy myself a big one hahaha!!!"}
{"text":"OMG! This place is so delicious! The Mac and cheese is to die for. The corn bread is dangerously delicious and the fried okra is marvelous with the dipping sauce. With all these yummy sides I forgot about the meat! It's yumbo for the tumbo as well. The staff is great as well and keeps the wine flowing. Expect to roll out of this restaurant and hit the gym the next day."}
{"text":"Wonderful hidden stop. Brisket sandwiches were delicious on perfectly toasted Texas toast. Great smoky cowboy beans too."}
{"text":"The Hawaiian chicken was unbelievable. Has to be the best chicken burger I ate in a while. It's a cute local restaurant with friendly waiters. Great service."}
{"text":"This place is a Barbecue oasis in the desert.  Brisket was cooked perfectly.  Sauce not too sweet. Mac and cheese was better than home made.  Service was super attentive and owner was making the rounds to make sure everyone was enjoying their meal.  Great place.  Definitely worth a stop going to or from Hoover Dam from Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food here is top notch. I've tried many different barbecue establishments and Fox smokehouse is by far the best of the best. If you go and don't love it, I will eat my shoes but only if I can dip them in they're famous barbecue sauce."}
{"text":"Was in Las Vegas for work and I came down to see the Hoover Dam and was looking for a quick place to eat before heading back to Las Vegas. The atmosphere was incredible. The owner is very friendly and took us into the kitchen and showed us how the meat was cooked and all the food was homemade. Absolutely outstanding customer service. The food fell off the bone and was outstanding. If you are within an hour of this place, I recommend going."}
{"text":"I am seriously addicted to Fox Smokehouse BBQ! I live in Summerlin and drive all the way to Boulder City (at least 40 minutes) to have it at least once a month-- it's that good! I love the pulled pork sandwich and their mac and cheese is to DIE for. I typically get my sandwich with the mild BBQ sauce and get a side of spicy sauce to drizzle over the top-- delicious!! Other reviewers mentioned that it's pricey, but I think it's 100% worth every penny."}
{"text":"Definite winner here! We had the ribs and beef brisket. Both were so tender and moist! Best ever along with the mild bbq sauce. They have two kinds of sauce, mild and spicy. The mild is wonderful, kinda sweet. The owner recommended for our sides the Mac-n-cheese made with 4 kinds of cheese and jalapeños in the sauce. It was perfect! Also the cowboy baked beans were equally as good, they had chopped brisket in them. I am already looking forward to going back! The owner was extremely friendly lady who made sure everyone was well fed and happy. Definite 5 star bbq."}
{"text":"We were not impressed after all the hype on how awesome the bbq is here.  The ribs were terrible like eating mush way over cooked with no flavor.  The brisket was OK.  The place is not very big so we had to wait which wasn't to bad but the lady that waited on us seemed put out that she actually had to take an order.  Will not be back and have made sure everyone we know knows NOT to go here."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork sandwich, cold slaw, French fries and Macaroni and Cheese. Can't help wondering what I will have tomarrow night. :))  Simply Amazing Food!"}
{"text":"I was here 6 days ago. They had two different bbq sauces. The mild one had no spice at all. The spicy one was mild, if that. The ribs were delicious but didn't really fall off the bone like it should. The mac n cheese was the best part of the dinner! It was so creamy and good. The potato salad was a huge fail. I couldn't even finish it. 

The food would've made this a 4/5 but what made it a 3 was their service towards other guests. We came about 30 before closing so by the time we were finishing up, it was almost time to close. Whenever guests would walk in they'd just say, \"we're closed!\" And just waiting to see if people would leave before them explaining that take out is still an option. 

Now let's think of it like this. If the place is open later than it should be, that could've been $30+ in your pockets and they basically didn't care just because the blond tall girl and the girl with the weird voice wanted to go home (especially the blond chick.) If you don't want to work there, go get another job and let people who need it and would appreciate it have it. 

You work in a restaurant. Get used to the way it works."}
{"text":"This place was doing a slamming take out business. So busy they ran out of ribs before 6pm. Damn! That was the only disappointment. A patron recommended the fantastic brisket. Side of tasty beans and pulled pork finished off the meal. Great food and friendly down home service. A must do if you are a BBQ fan. So glad we found this little joint hidden behind Von's shopping center."}
{"text":"Just the best BBQ west of Paducah, Ky. Recently went back home, had my Starnes fix. Dan & staff really have it together here. Awesome everything, & with new liquor license, have your margarita with the brisket. Did lunch with RSOs from BRPC. Jerry loved the burnt ends. I'm a pork slider guy. Keep it up Foxx peeps."}
{"text":"On the way back from Hoover dam , the fam was a little munchie after all the hiking , so we found this BBQ joint in Boulder City, kids and I had the ribs which tasted very fresh and smoky. The sauces where spot on too with a spicy or sweet variety , a mix was good for me and the homemade mac and cheese was also good. The wife has brisket tacos and that was surprisingly good as well"}
{"text":"Ordered ribs with mac n cheese and cowboy beans. Wife had bbq Philly. Knew I was in for a treat when I took my first bite and meat fell off the bone. Excellent from first to last bite."}
{"text":"Excellent bbq. Very friendly and tasty place. We would like to visit again if we happen to swing by the area."}
{"text":"we were driving thru coming back from Grand Canyon...bumped into.this place...it was delicious!! everything was great!"}
{"text":"Well....this was a pretty damn disappointing experience.  I've eaten here before and it was pretty darn good.  But this time I got a to-go order.  3 pulled pork BBQ sandwiches with potato salad.  Over $30 later....got it home within 5 minutes....and it truly wasn't even edible.  The bun was like it was warmed up hours earlier & then thrown in a microwave.  You couldn't even bite or chew through it.  It was like cardboard.  And the pork....it was dried out...no flavor...and chunks of fat throughout it.  I don't know what the deal was with the \"cooks\" that day.  I did not see the owner there either this time.  Usually when I eat inside....I see him walking around the establishment.  BC is too small to have inconsistency and just not good food....word gets around quickly!  Even the potato salad that came in Styrofoam containers...were only half filled with salad.  I hope the owner reads this & keeps a little bit closer eye on who is preparing the food here.  He does seem like a very cool guy....and I hate to write something bad about his place...but I have to tell the truth about our experience.  I didn't recognize any of the other employees that were working that day either.  Perhaps he hired new gals/guys?  But they certainly weren't cutting it that day.  I think if the owner were there...he'd of been pretty PO'd by what they were serving.  I guess all good things come to an end.  I'll give it another shot...but if it's to-go....I'll be checking my order thoroughly.  Oh!  Another little thing I found odd...When we've eaten inside restaurant...we always get a pickle spear with our sandwich.....Well I asked the girl at the counter where are the pickle spears for our 3 sandwiches...and she said \"You don't get a pickle with to-go orders.\"  I found that to be pretty damn cheap of them....considering a sandwich is $10!  Geesh!  Don't hurt yourself!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the greater Las Vegas area. I heard of this place a while back but never tried it because I smoke my own BBQ and have tried some really good BBQ around the US. I guess you could say I'm a BBQ snob. I finally went today just so I could say that I tried it and it was great. I will definitely be a regular considering we live 10 minutes away and my office is in BC. Good job guys!"}
{"text":"Come eat good bbq now. Don't think. Just come. Brisket. Cowboy fries. Mac n cheese. Nom nom nom"}
{"text":"Just saw Hoover dam.....found this place. The smell is the best. Everyone was lovimg this food!"}
{"text":"$1 PBR, the best brisket you'll ever have, and such friendly service! What a gem of a spot... a must-visit before or after seeing the Hoover Dam. The cowboy beans are also killer!"}
{"text":"The 30 minute drive here is so worth it. The absolute best ribs in the Las Vegas area."}
{"text":"On our way to Hoover dam we saw great reviews for this small BBQ place. So grateful to yelp since it is on a side street off of US 93.
Stepping through the front doors you get a blast of smokey goodness that lets you know you're in for something special. Some of the best BBQ I've had! The ribs are crazy good, Mac-n-cheese goes quick and the staff couldn't be more hospitable. 
Not sure if I'll ever be through Boulder City again, but next time I'm in Vegas I would seriously consider the 20 minute drive to get this BBQ!"}
{"text":"Being from Henderson, we'd heard enough about Fox's to want to make the trek to Boulder City for dinner. All I can say is... I know I should have slowed down to enjoy the food; but I just couldn't put it in my mouth fast enough. When friends come to visit, I'm bringing them to Fox's! Even the cherry cobbler for desert tastes amazing. Go right now!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I can remember. I got the brisket and ribs with a side of beans. All three were off the charts. Brisket was lean, tasty and tender. The ribs pulled clean from the bone. Both meats were obviously cooke by hot smoke to perfection. The beans should be canned and sold in my local grocery store, just totally delicious. The reviews are correct and honest. I would give this place 6 stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of those times where you enjoyed the food so much...that you take to your computer as soon as your done, so you can write a review while the food is still tickling your taste buds.  Decided to take a little drive and check out this spot out in Boulder City.  Parallel parked outside the joint (felt really good to do that btw) and was greeted when I walked in.  Had a few patrons enjoying their meals so I felt like I was in for a treat.  Decided to order a combo so I can get a feel for the ribs and brisket...since it seems like every place has a completely different flavor profile and even texture of the meat served.  The staff was extremely nice and explained specials and combo breakdowns.  Now while I'm sitting down and waiting for my order, the owner strolls in with a huge trophy in his hand, which at the bottom reads \"2015 Las Vegas Ribfest Nevada Barbecue Association 2nd Place\", and also a plaque where he placed first in the restaurant category for best ribs in LV.  After seeing this...I'm like okay taste buds...lets see if the hype is real!!
For the food:
Ribs: Fall off the bone delicious.  Great flavor profile.  Sauce added was sweet yet spicy.  Meat was beyond tender, and I was literally upset when I noticed it was all gone from my box.  Some of the best I've ever tasted.
Brisket: Soft, easy to pull apart.  Melt in your mouth good.  Sauce is served on the side, where you can just dip and not have it overpower the taste of the actual meat.  Simply delicious.
Mac N Cheese: Finally a restaurant that knows what they're doing when it comes to mac n cheese!! It has a great little kick to it that was surprising. Cheesy. Delicious. Love it.
Triple Layer Chocolate Fudge Cake: Best chocolate cake I've ever had in my life.  Thats all.

Lets just say that I'm happy my car gets 30mpg highway...because I will be making a trip out there often."}
{"text":"Outstanding everything. It's worth the drive from Vegas. Trust me, I don't know much, but I do know that."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch at 12:30 on a nice 78 degree day in November. After doing a search on Yelp, this barbeque joint popped up on the Yelp list. I love barbeque so off I went.

At first I thought it was probably gonna be packed since it was lunch time but the place was empty. Weird. 

Im for all things beef so I went with the Two Meat Combo ($15) of Brisket and Tri-Tip with a side of Cowboy Fries (for a $1.50 more). Ordering those two meats were a dollar more each extra. To wash it down, I added a fountain drink ($2). Total with tax was $21.08. Damn. 

I guess they did me a favor by only charging me a dollar extra instead of two for the two meats? So confusing. Still, anything over 20 bucks for lunch better be worth it.

So while I was waiting for my order, I read a couple reviews. One of them they said the brisket was dry. Another said the tri-tip was dry also. What? Those are the two meats I ordered! So before my order came out I was already a bit worried.

If you refer to my pic you get about the same amount of food as you would other barbeque joints. The Brisket was actually quite juicy and you can taste the smokiness to it. The Tri-Tip was a little dry because it was overcooked just a bit. The Cowboy Fries were basically crinkle cut fries topped off with beans, onions, and cheese. Not bad at all.

Service was just ok. You order at the counter and they bring it out to you. Nothing overly special about that.

On your table they have a mild and a spicy barbeque sauce for you to add to you meal. The mild had a sweet tang to it while the spicy had chipotle flavor to it with just right amount of kick. I ended up mixing the two together because I liked both sauces.

Some random info: They take cards. When you check in on Yelp, you get free dessert. They have tables and chairs set up outside if you want to eat out there. Parking is along side the street.

Overall, I thought the food was decent but kind of pricey. In comparison to my favorite bbq joint in Vegas, you can get a THREE meat combo for 15 bucks. Feel free to message me if you want to know what place that is. Since I havnt tried their ribs yet, I think that is just enough to warrant another trip out here in the future. Until then, the hefty price I paid will linger with me for quite sometime.

{"text":"Delicious food, great atmosphere, the people are extremely nice and amazing service definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp. The reviews were great and my experience was even better than I had hoped. The service and food stands out. The owner, who visited our table twice during a short lunch time meal, obviously is passionate about bbq. I ordered a 2 meat combo with brisket, ribs, beans, mac and cheese and rolls. Everything tasted great and the portions are large. The smoke flavor stood out in the taste of the food and smell in the restaurant. It was by far the best bbq I have ever eaten. Well worth the drive from Vegas or anywhere within 100 miles or more. I live far away and I'm trying to think of an excuse to visit Vegas again soon so I can get some more of this bbq. It really is that good."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here today with my family after going on the \"Dam\" tour.
We shared our lunches so we could get a taste of the meats.
We had brisket, pulled pork, sausage, and ribs. A nice sampling of their fine meats. We were all in unison in saying that all the meats we tried were delicious!! They all had a wonderful Smokey flavor while still being moist and tender.
For sides we all shared the Mac&Cheese, baked beans, Cole slaw, French Fries and onion rings. Again these were all very delicious.
Highly recommend this place if you want good food at a fair price with awesome service!
We will come back every time we visit the dam."}
{"text":"The brisket and pulled pork were amazing! Their cowboy fries were great too! We also had the Mac and cheese and cowboy beans, which were my husband's favorite!"}
{"text":"We had the brisket macaroni and cheese and fried okra....I  wish I could say it deserved a five star but it fell short. Brisket was not very flavorful  or tender. It was just okay. Mac and cheese was not very good. The best thing was the fried okra.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"on our way to Hoover Dam, found this awesome BBQ place, great service great food! Awesome experience"}
{"text":"I had the brisket philly sandwich with spicy bbq sauce and it was delicious! The spicy sauce wasn't really spicy for me, but it was very flavorful. I will definitely be back for more. The service was fast and the staff is very friendly. You will really enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"So I'm supposed to come all the way back into the restaurant after getting take out just to tell you what you already should know? I just ate the dissapointing food and dealt with it. It's not that hard to find someone else to come in and order food undercover at various times of day, but that's your problem, not mine. Don't worry, I will not be dissapointed anymore by your subpar food. I'm sure you shine during those BBQ contests though.. good luck with that."}
{"text":"Another yelper suggested I check this place out, clearly knowing my love for MEAT!!! She did not do me wrong!!

Went in during the \"art in the Park\" weekend so it was extra busy!
Which would explain why the service was not perfect, but I understood what was going on.

The food, on the other hand was COMPLETELY PERFECT! The meat was tender and flavorful. For my side, I ordered Mac & Cheese, it was so good! Had a little bit of kick to it, not sure what that was but it was AWESOME!

This is now my Boulder City \"Go-To\" spot!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing !!! Came with our Camaro club.  Fast friendly and prompt service.  Oh, and the BBQ was GREAT!!!! Will be back with family"}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, very welcoming. Excellent food. Brisket tacos were wonderful, as were the beans and Mac and cheese. We would call the tacos more like burritos in CA, but whatever you call them, they were really good. Good prices, waitress very helpful and friendly. Would go there all the time if I lived here!"}
{"text":"Excellent taste, great and fast service! Thank you for great food!! Dan FOX/owner's kind presence and making sure we were satisfied. Great gesture from the proprietor himself. 

P.S. Coming from Summerlin was definitely worth the drive!! Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the drive.  The food was delicious!   The pulled pork was so tender and mac n cheese has a nice kick!"}
{"text":"Great value. Great food. I wish I wasn't trying to lose weight, I'd be there every day."}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ places I have ever been. The ribs were cooked to perfection. The house BBQ sauce had perfect amount of acidity and sweetness."}
{"text":"No wonder this place has 5 stars with 400+ reviews! It is AMAZING! The BBQ here is sooooooo good! After a visit to Hoover Dam, my husband and I didn't think we'd be able to find any great food nearby but we were so wrong. Highly recommend coming here if you are in town to see the Dam.  

We each ordered the platter with two meats and one side. I Got chicken and sausage and he got pulled pork and brisket so that we could try everything. Our favorite was the brisket but it was all AMAZING!! Some of the best BBQ we've ever had!!"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to stop here before we visited the Hoover Dam. Being from Texas, this was some damn good BBQ. The brisket was tender and the ribs were marinated to perfection. The man n' cheese is the best side in my opinion. Great lunch stop!"}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ joint!! Best brisket I've had in Vegas, the rib meat falls of the bone, the mac n cheese is delightful and all at extremely affordable prices.
Spend less than $20 per person and be stuffed full of goodness for 24 hours!!
Best barbecue. Period."}
{"text":"I used to live in Boulder City and I'd eat here pretty often. Really decent pricing, big portions, friendly staff. Even now that I live far away, if I ever want some excellent ribs, I make the trip out. So worth it. And they've expanded since the last time I was there. Way more room for seating. I highly recommend this place for BBQ. It is honestly the best BBQ joint in the greater Vegas area. The sides are a bit unique too. The cowboy beans are almost like a chili. The mac and cheese has some pepper jack cheese in it. Oh and the fries are good too! Super important to me haha
Make the trip out there. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Nice BBQ spot off the beaten path. My wife and I had dinner here last night. We tried the ribs, brisket and pulled pork. All of the meats had good flavor. The beans and French fries are good. They have $1 PBR on tap and very reasonably priced drinks. The service was good, I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Had our taste buds ready for some good BBQ. Went to the Best Dam BBQ at Bicentennial Park and they were closing up. Newspaper said hours were until 6 PM but at 5:10 not much left. So we decided to go here. In our opinion, this was the BEST dam BBQ."}
{"text":"\"A gallon of barbecue sauce? Ten pounds of cocktail meatballs?\" Kramer, Seinfeld

It was mid afternoon, just after their lunch rush on a Tuesday. A big table of folks were just getting up as we walked up to the counter to order:

Grub:  2 meat, 2 side combo w/ Brisket & Chicken, cole slaw & beans.  Plus a 1/2 slab of ribs and some corn bread.  When the baskets came I was taken aback... the chicken came sliced and was nice, cole slaw & corn bread average, the beans were actually off the hook - super good, some of the best I've had.  Ribs were a good portion, tender with good smoke, not bitter at all.

But the brisket was a mess - it was a pile of debris, not a discernible \"slice\" to be seen, looked like the leftover chopping's from previous servings or maybe chopped for a sandwhich?.  Fairly dry, luke warm... had to drown it in sauce to stick between the roll to make an impromptu sandwich.  I've had my fair share of brisket and was expecting a couple of nice slices, seasoned and smoked such that little or no sauce would be needed.  It was the reason we sought this spot out... reviews indicated we were in for a treat, but not so.

Speculation is varied,  but maybe they were running low because of the lunch rush?  If so, I'd suggest just telling your customer, I would've ordered the tri-tip and had a much better meal.

Clean bathrooms, clean dining room, lots of street parking, fountain drinks.

Must be just our experience, will definitely give them another try when passing through Vegas again.  Wasn't the 5 star experience so many have had... hope to update review with another visit this fall.  Just OK, pretty bummed."}

{"text":"Cozy off the beaten path bbq place. I had the burnt ends with a side of okra.  Excellent!! The burnt ends melt in your mouth - the okra was delicious!!Our waitress was very friendly and helpful in explaining any questions we had. 
They have lots of interesting items on the walls and the wind chimes are a nice touch.  Pricing is good too! Would definitely make the trip to Boulder City for another meal of burnt ends or brisket"}
{"text":"The young lady who took care of us could not be any sweeter and very accommodating. This is our second time here and we love the food. We split the brisket sandwich and ordered the wings. Both were delis he's. But the beans and sweet potato fries were just amazing. Stop by..don't drive by."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome!  Had the ribs....fall off the bone FANTASTIC!! My husband had the brisket sandwich. ..he thought it was very good. We will be back."}
{"text":"The food here was fabulous!  It's super cheap for what you get.  Get the mac&cheese!! I'll be coming back here when I visit vegas next time.  Worth the drive"}
{"text":"After having this bookmarked for over a year I finally made it out here to try their BBQ.  We had been riding the zip lines with FlightLinez and were pretty hungry.  Being from the southern U.S. I do love good BBQ and was excited to give Fox a try.  We were able to sit down right away which was unusual as this place can be busy from what I have been told.  
  We each ordered something different so we could try a variety of their items.  The wife got the beef and pork ribs which were very good.  The meat was fall off the bone tender which is a good sign.  It was moist and smokey flavored.  Add in some of the sweet BBQ sauce and it was perfect.  I had the brisket and pulled pork.  The brisket was moist and smokey flavored also.  Dipped into the BBQ sauce it was super tasty.  The pulled pork was the let down.  It had only mild smoke flavor and was bland in taste.  Not as tender as it should have been so I won't order it again.  
  We also had the fried okra which was delicious.  We all loved it and despite ordering a large we devoured it way too quickly.  The Okra is so good we stopped but a few weeks later while heading home from a hike and ordered a couple of large fried Okra's to go.  I also had their baked beans which were very good.  With a few veggies and some brisket added it they were a real treat.  i also had a side of their Mac and Cheese.  it was heavy on the cheese which for me was great.  I have to order mac and cheese and it be light on cheese.  Fox's mac and cheese was creamy and everyone enjoyed it.
   Our waitress was awesome.  Super friendly and always paid attention if we needed anything.  The inside was clean and well decorated.  It had the feel of a southern BBQ restaurant so I felt right at home.  I am already craving the Okra and Brisket and will have to head another visit to Fox's soon!"}
{"text":"Wow!  After visiting the Hover Dam in the morning we were looking for a lunch and we were impressed!  Awesome bbq in the smalll unassuming strip mall! We each had a half rack of ribs with a beer and now can't wait to enjoy summer back home.  Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I eat BBQ in two places. That's it. And the only reason it's two places is because I live 40 minutes from Fox's. That being said, it is worth every second of the drive. There is a reason Fox's has been recognized nationally. I've eaten here many times, and haven't had a bad meal. The pulled pork, stand alone or on a sandwich (The Porky), is to die for. Perfectly BBQ'd every time. I get pickles and slaw on my sandwich and it's my favorite thing here. My wife is an absolute brisket snob, and she will forever judge all brisket against Fox's. Anytime she has brisket someplace else, I'll ask her how it is.  \"Meh, it's not Fox's, that's for sure\" is the response every time. The Hawaiian Chicken sandwich is really good. Often, chicken on sandwiches like this is over cooked because the chef knows that the pineapple or sauces will mask the dryness. Not here, the chicken holds up on its own without the pineapple and sauce. It's that good!!  Next time you're in BC, you gotta stop at Fox's and get the best Dam BBQ in the state, if not the country!!"}
{"text":"I love the staff and service, oh and of course the food especially the cherry cheesecake"}
{"text":"We were visiting Vegas from Indianapolis, and coming back from the Hoover Dam, decided to stop there just based on Yelp's reviews. I can say that it's been one of the best BBQ places I've ever been. Ever better than some places in Nashville. The Mac and cheese was delicious and the ribs were amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic bbq... it's the best here in the entire Vegas Valley and so worth the drive even if you're up on the north side!  Absolutely fabulous food from the ribs to the beef brisket, beans, you name it.  Simply delicious!!  Small space so call ahead an make a reservation if you go as a group but the owners are fantastic too and very accommodating.  A MUST go place for BBQ!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding BBQ. Pulled pork and brisket were both tender and complemented perfectly by the spicy BBQ sauce. My new favorite BBQ joint!"}
{"text":"Avoid!!! Portions here are super small!! I ordered the combo 3 with brisket and bratwurst. 3 little small portions of brisket which tasted great, however the sausage was pretty gross. I smothered it in BBQ so that helped the taste. The mac and cheese side was  good which you get one side and roll. I ordered a sweet tea and this lunch set me back over 21 bucks!!! Wayyyy over priced and the quality of the food was really so so..


Skip this place!!! I know bbq is expensive but compared to other better establishments they are about 30% over priced for smaller portions."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ! You have to try everything but my favorite, by far, is the bratwurst. The ambiance is fun, they are definitely outgrowing the location. Looking forward to them opening many more locations!"}
{"text":"First of all, I don't know where to start. 
This place smells amazing!!! 
I dislike Mac & cheese like most hate liver and onions. 
With that being said, their Mac & cheese is delicious beyond words. The service is incredible and the place is super clean. The staff is awesome. The atmosphere is fun. If your in our small town of Boulder City, you must stop by and satisfy your taste buds. 
 P.S. I'm not a fan of BBQ., this is bbq on a whole other level. You won't be disappointed. Easy to find on Elm street."}
{"text":"I need six stars....five stars is an injustice that fails to convey my esteem for this establishment. The food is simple and straightforward, but their love of food comes through in every bite. We will make a point to come here every time we are within a hundred miles. Do yourself a favor, and stop here; help the owners knock down the walls, because their gonna need a bigger restaurant."}
{"text":"We're SOOO happy that we found Fox Smokehouse on Yelp! FANTASTIC brisket and ribs, and friendly service made this an outstanding meal!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I'm from Texas so my BBQ standards are pretty high. There seemed to be limited options in the area so I took a chance on a BBQ place off the beaten path and hoped for the best. Wow! I had the sliders but was able to taste the beef, pork, sausage, and chicken as long as I snagged my taste before my table mates could stab me with their forks. All the meat was fall apart tender. I tried the cole slaw, potato salad, beans, and loaded fries - all good. Beans filled with pieces of meat, potato salad had nice chunks of potato, and what can you say about fries loaded with beans, meat, and cheese other than \"yum\"!. As if that's not enough they have cheap draft beer and a nice bottle selection.  It's worth leaving Las Vegas for any day of the week!"}
{"text":"I'm from St. Louis where BBQ is big and serious business so I've eaten my fair share of smoked meat. This place did not disappoint. 

I had ribs and brisket. I usually prefer dry ribs but these were very wet, falling off the bone and super tasty. The brisket was melt in your mouth good. I also had the mac and cheese but didn't know it had green chilles added so it was a bit too hot for me. My wife had a chicken salad and sweet potato fries. The chicken had great flavor (I swear I detected cinnamon) and the sweet potato fries were tasty."}
{"text":"The brisket sandwich was amazing but the sides such as the macaroni and cheese and potato salad  was simply horrible. I took a bite and simply could not finish it."}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem. Great food and service is fast and friendly.  Prices are in line and the portions are just right."}
{"text":"Amazing bbq. Great service. The brisket is something to be tried, savored & dreamt about afterwards. Why didn't I see the PBR for a buck earlier!?! And then, check in & get a free dessert! Worth the drive! What are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Dan (owner) is the man with the plan with his crack Mac n Cheese. The BBQ is all super tender. You can cut the meat with a spoon. Delicious party in your mouth. No matter if you get the brisket , ribs or so forth. 
Super friendly staff that makes you feel like home. Quality everything on your plate. A must try spot or returning spot."}
{"text":"I wish this place was closer to where I live. The bbq chicken, pulled pork, brisket and tacos are crazy good. Don't pass up the mac and cheese either. It was so delicious it's all I could think about since having it for the first time ealier this week. Had to get it again!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to check this place out based in all of the great reviews!!!

Main items that I was interested in were the pork ribs, brisket, Mac and cheese, and corn bread. Now the blow by blow...
The ribs: they were not baby backs as I had hoped but rather the St Louis type, which can be very good if prepared correctly... Cooked so that the fat is nicely rendered away. These were cooked very tender but very fatty. They almost had a boiled consistency vs BBQ with a crust. Lightly seasoned. 

The brisket: moist and tender, but under seasoned... First time I have ever added salt to BBQ. Again no real \"bark\" to the pieces... That I really like.

Mac and cheese: very odd flavor... Not sure what seasoning that was included maybe vinegar? Undercooked. Just did not float my boat.

Corn bread: served cold. Nothing impressive. 

Bummer day... Really was looking forward to a phenomenal meal... Not today unfortunately."}
{"text":"Fell into this place while staying in Boulder City for a Hoover Dam tour.  This place is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good.  the staff is friendly.  the servings are RIDICULOUSLY huge.  Plus everything we tried was DELICIOUS.  The only bad thing I can say is that I live too  far away to eat here more often (550 miles)."}
{"text":"Service and food were awesome. Definitely don't wanna miss out on this place if you are in this neck of the woods."}
{"text":"Stopped here after visiting the Hoover dam. Lisa was extremely helpful and friendly at the counter, she took the time to explain the menu and gave me several suggestions. We both ended up with the smokehouse burger and Mac and cheese side. The burger was DELICIOUS.. And the Mac and cheese was also amazing. The place was clean and the food was ready in a matter of minutes"}
{"text":"Went for early dinner in a Friday night but boy oh boy it got packed by the time we finished our delicious dinners. The waitress was cheerful and prompt not like the unhappy waiter we had at The Yardhouse last night. The food was good and we opted for the free dessert thru Yelp with a purchase. It's a huge piece of cherry cheesecake - the real thing. They let you pick off the dessert menu a $4.50 value. The combo plates are best for dinners. I had the ribs and bratwurst with Cole slaw. It was a good choice and I'm full. No draft Heineken so the pyramid wasn't bad. It's not a fancy restaurant and watch for that small step in the center of the dining area. We saw a woman fall hard. I'll go there every time I visit Boulder City."}
{"text":"Amazing brisket. You will not be disappointed. Do not miss going to this gem if you are i the area"}
{"text":"I couldn't understand how this place has 5 out of 5 stars. Now I understand.The food here is delicious. Probably the best in the state of Nevada. I had the ribs combo plate with mac n cheese. The ribs were tender and fall off the bone. The meat was a little fatty but nothing abnormal. The taste of the ribs without any sauce on it was absolutely tasty. The sauce made it even better. The mac n cheese tasted homemade and delicious. The best part of the whole meal is the dessert. You have to try the dessert they are known for - the Apple Custard - It is  absolutely the best and most delicious dessert you will EVER have!"}
{"text":"It's off the beaten path from more popular areas of Boulder City, and the location in a small strip mall may not look like much, but the barbecue was amazing! The beef ribs were a showstopper, not only because of their massive Flintstone-esque appearance, but because the flavor from those huge, tender chunks of meat was better than any other beef ribs I've ever had. The rub was a perfect blend of spices to give it smokiness, hints of heat, with enough salinity to make your mouth water.

The 2 meat combo was great too. The brisket was perfectly meaty and fatty with some good smoke to the flavor. The pork ribs (3 of them) had plenty of fall-off-the bone meat. Fries, covered in a steak seasoning, were a great addition to the combo, too. The mac n cheese was the weak link, as it was too watery. Strangely, other orders at our table were just the opposite."}
{"text":"The hype is real. Fox is putting out some legit BBQ and my hubby and I both now know exactly where we will be eating when passing through Boulder City. The first time I came here was on Halloween, so seeing this place was on Elm St added some spooky fun excitement (I love horror movies). I have been back since and each time has been just as delicious as the previous visit. There is only parking on the street and luckily we have been able to nab a spot right out front, but I've seen the street fill up quick while waiting for my food. Keep in mind there is a wait for good reason. Inside is clean with a good amount of tables and chairs. The girls working have always been really sweet and great about the substitutions I have requested on certain things. 

Brisket Sandwich ($11) - Brisket on grilled Texas toast. The brisket is tender and has amazing flavor! You can have coleslaw on the side or on the sandwich and you can choose either mild or spicy bbq sauce on the side or on the sandwich. The brisket sandwich here is a real winner and they also have brisket tacos that are worth checking out. The brisket sandwich also included one side.

Tri-Tip Philly ($12.00) - On the menu they have the Brisket Philly under Smokehouse Specials and I asked if they could substitute the brisket for tri-tip and they did it with no problem. It comes with tri-tip, grilled peppers with onions and provolone cheese on a toasted hoagie roll. They certainly didn't skimp on the cheese and the whole sandwich just tasted effing delicious plus is comes with a side. Highly recommended.

Combo #1 ($10) - Choice of one meat and side and comes with a dinner roll. I went with pulled pork for the meat and it was so tender and tasty. The mild bbq sauce is a bit too sweet for me and I like sweet sauces. The spicy bbq sauce on the other hand was pretty tasty paired with the pulled pork. I do recommend asking for a couple extra dinner rolls with this meal, I didn't and wished I did to make a few sliders with the meat. 

Mac & Cheese ($2.75 for small and $5.50 for large) - Holy mac and cheese this stuff is good! I did notice that the mac and cheese hasn't looked the same each time. One time it was super creamy and then the other times not so much. Regardless it still has tasted the same and been cheesy and the addition of green chilies is a nice touch. 

Cowboy Cheese Fries ($4.25 for small and $8.50 for large) - I got the large portion to share with hubby and it was huge! They take a generous amount of fries and top it with their cowboy beans (a worthy side if you like ranch style beans with smoked meat in it), cheese and onions. I have seen in pictures where shredded cheese was on the fries and on mine it had a nacho type cheese sauce which I didn't mind at all. The fries held up the toppings well with out getting too soggy. 

They have to-go menus and take phone orders as well offer catering."}
{"text":"I am from Texas and I moved to Las Vegas 3 years ago.  I haven't found a BBQ place I liked until Fox Smokehouse opened up.  The BBQ is AMAZING!!!  The brisket is soooo good and I love the potato salad and mac n cheese is AWESOME!  I work at the hospital and our doctor here is also from Texas and he loved the BBQ also.  I highly, highly recommend the food and the owners and staff are fantastic!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the portions are ridiculously small. I ordered (2) 1 meat combos with an extra side. Came to $35. Got it to go. When I get home and opened, I was EXTREMELY disappointed to see 6 very small pieces of brisket between the 2 combos (3) a piece. I literally had more cornbread than meat. I uploaded a picture also to back up my review. Again food is good, portions make it not even worth it for me.  I don't know how Nevada does bbq, but it seems portions are very small. In California that same $17 would have had been more than enough meat with the sides to fill me up. I was still very hungry after this appetizer basically."}
{"text":"I came here a few months ago on vacation on my way to Hoover Dam. It was amazing. I'm from Texas so BBQ is no joke and I had been craving some good food. The service was great, the food was phenomenal (I had sausage and brisket) and on top of that the chocolate cake was HUGE!!!!!! And it was some of the best chocolate cake I've ever had! Ate it the rest of my 3 day trip. All in all, this place rocks and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was taking a trip up to the dam and checked out Yelp to find a good place for lunch in Boulder. Fox Smokehouse had five stars and great reviews so I decided to give it a try. That was an excellent decision and Yelp did not steer me wrong.

The servers were friendly, even letting me try out a taste of the coleslaw, and kept my drink filled. The tri-tip Philly was delicious and the sweet potato fries were very tasty. The meat on the sandwich was smoky, fall apart tender, and juicy even without the sauce. It was a very filling meal so I did not have a chance to try dessert but I'd bet it was just a s good.

It's not too far of drive from Vegas so I'll have to go out there again another weekend to try the ribs and bring some of that fantastic brisket home."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The food is really good. We actually drive from near Boulder and Russell because we enjoy the food so much, but after tonight we won't be back. I went in tonight with my wife, and I've never felt so uncomfortable in my life. I felt like I was being watched. As usual the food was good. The staff was polite while waiting on us, but we heard the girls that were waiting on tables (there were about three of them) joking with each other about us. We weren't doing anything inappropriate or even outwardly gay but we heard things like \"...yeah definitely not traditional...\" One waitress even made an inappropriate anti gay joke to two other customers sitting at the table next to ours. Even if it wasn't directed at us, stuff like that is inappropriate in any workplace within ear shot of other customers. We didn't even stay to finish our meals. We ate about half, paid, and left. It's a shame you all had a really nice little place.

I do have to add that Foxes has great service recovery I was messaged by one of the managers and one of the owners...I didn't get a chance to discuss this incident further as was offered...because life happens. I do now feel like this was a one-time incident and we will be returning in the future"}
{"text":"It's Mother's Day & we took the little ones to ride the train here in Boulder City. I asked the wife what she would like for her Mother's Day lunch and she wanted BBQ. Well, Vegas hasn't been too kind to us in that particular genre of food, so we turned to Yelp. Lo and behold, a 4.5 star place a half mile from the train depot. 

If you are looking for sawdust on the floor gimmick bar-b-que, drive to Vegas. The focus here is on the food. There's about twelve or so tables with some picnic tables outside. Upon entering, the smell hits you like a ton of bricks. My mouth started watering immediately. I got the nod from the wife, so we ordered. 

Being our first visit, we kept to the beef, so I will review other meats on my next visit (which will probably be in a couple of weeks or so). She ordered the tri tip sandwich with fries. I order the brisket with fries. The boys (18 months & 3 1/2) split a quesadilla with...fries. The sandwiches came on Texas toast. We opted to swap a half so as to try both meats. Let me tell you, this meat was top shelf. Tender & full of flavor. Seriously, one of the best beef brisket sandwiches I've had...ever. Definitely the best brisket sandwich I've had in Nevada! I didn't try their spicy bbq sauce, but the mild sauce was a perfect balance of sweet & tangy. While the tri tip was solid, I kinda wish I hadn't traded the wife my half...that brisket rocked!

I'm also a big fan of friendly folks & the family that runs this joint are some of the nicest people you can be fed by! Greeted with a smile & once seated, brought by crayons and coloring pages for the boys. And while there are no waiter or waitresses (really not needed due to the size of the place), they were always making sure we were taken care of. 

This place is definitely worth checking out if you like great BBQ. I've been to a bunch of places in Las Vegas/Henderson and this is the real deal. I am already looking forward to eating there again soon!"}
{"text":"This is tied for the best BBQ I've ever had (tied with Pappy's Smokehouse in St. Louis, MO). I've never had anything here that I haven't liked in the 8+ times I've been here and everything has been cooked to perfection. This place used to be rather small and you ordered from the counter, but they expanded and doubled the interior size, so now it's a sit-down restaurant. The service is good, the people are super friendly, and it's a local favorite for the police and fire department. I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"WOW I wish they had more than 5 star because this was the BEST BBQ we have had!!!! Ribs falling off the bone, homemade mac and cheese with a little crust on top, coleslaw creamy and the cowboy beans to die for!!!! Staff very friendly and happy!! Great job we will definitely be back!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We stayed in BC for 3 weeks......ate here weekly.....OMG!  Best stuff EVER!

EVERYTHING that is said about this place is REAL.......Tender Brisket, tasty sides......The Brats are on point.   We usually get combos and always have left overs for lunch the next day......My favorite is the Brisket Sandwich.....you can't miss.  Sauces are very good, but honestly, you really don't need them.......the bark on the meat has all the seasoning you need.  A little salt and pepper does the trick. 

Price is comparable to any restaurant on The Strip.....BUT, the service is hands-down and has a friendly, small town feel.  It doesn't get any better"}
{"text":"This guy from LA walks into this bbq joint after 2 days of fun in Vegas a 1/2 hour before they close (which is usually a no no)with blood shot eyes and a slight hangover. Orders a 1/2 rack of ribs and bam the nest ribs I've ever had!! My guaranteed first stop next time I'm back in Boulder City!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here with family after visiting Hoover Dam. What a great place! I had the #3 combo and the brisket was amazing and the ribs were some of the best I have had. The waitress was a sweetheart and the owner stopped to see how we were doing."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Las Vegas last week from MN for our 24 year anniversary. We stopped by for a late lunch on our way back from Hoover Dam. I got a chicken and pork slider. It was the best BBQ we've ever had and the buns were awesome. The prices for food and beer was also a nice welcome when you compare it to the ridiculous cost in Las Vegas.
Only wish we had a Foxy in MN."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS. A hidden gem off the beaten path in Boulder City. Saw an article on MSN about BBQ places and this one is rated #1 in Nevada. I can see why. Brisket moist and tender and packed with smokey goodness. The burnt ends were properly \"burnt\".  The pulled pork shredded and served up with just the right amount of saltiness and sauce. We had apps of mozz sticks and onion rings. The mozz sticks were good but OMG the onion rings!!! Thick slices of rings batter dipped and fried to crunchy crisp perfection. Fox is our new go to place for BBQ. Thankful that we are less than 30 minutes away."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!

We were a group of 21 including a bunch of hungry Boy Scouts from NJ who had spent the prior week rafting the Colorado through the Grand Canyon. Knowing we would not have much time to wait, and knowing we would be out of contact until we arrived in Boulder City, I contacted the restaurant a couple of weeks before we left NJ.

The restaurant suggested we pre-order the food before we left, and then call once we arrived at Boulder City. So we did.

As our group arrived at the restaurant, the staff were expecting us and sufficient tables were reserved with water at the ready. In minutes, boxes of food labelled with names were being handed out and teenage chatter gave way to munching and comments of appreciation. BBQ newbies and those of us who have had real BBQ before all appreciated this great BBQ feast! When we were done the bill was ready (no lengthy wait for staff to add it up as tended to happen elsewhere) and so we were out of there having recovered time lost to a late flight.

My thanks to Dan and the restaurant team for accommodating our needs efficiently and with great service. PLUS - everyone raved about the food!"}
{"text":"Well, I can't really add much to these other reviews except to agree wholeheartedly that the food is amazing!!  Honestly, BBQ has never really been one of my favorite foods, but after a solid recommendation from a gentleman we met from Kansas City (who obviously knows BBQ!) we had to try this place out.  We were not disappointed.  Between my husband and I, we tried the pulled pork, chicken, ribs and the brisket (my favorite!!)  Everything was delicious, and oh, the mac and cheese!!  Don't forget the Caramel Apple Custard Parfait for dessert; I believe this is made from scratch daily and is a must try!!  I must respectfully disagree with the reviewer that said Lucille's is better; it doesn't hold a candle to Fox's in our opinion, and you'll definitely get more for your money here.  Cheap beer and a very friendly staff make this one of our new favorite places!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I can safely say that this is easily the best BBQ I have ever had in my life.  There were three of us in our party and we all thought the same thing.  I had to pulled pork sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese.  The pulled pork was tender and juicy and they gave you two extra bottles of their homemade BBQ sauce to apply as you'd like.  The Mac and cheese was great as well! The second member in my party had the ribs with a side of cornbread and a side of cowboy beans.  The meat literally slid off the bone when he picked up the first rib to take a bite.  I sampled the cornbread which was outstanding! The third member of my group had a chicken sandwich with a side of fries. I was able to sample a fry too.  I really enjoyed the seasoning!  Overall, it'd be hard to find a BBQ joint better than this one!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was driving back from Hoover dam with a friend when we decided to stop for lunch. We picked this place due to the reviews and weren't disappointed. It is in an industrial park, which is a strange place for a restaurant, but it works.

The menu has lots of options. Plenty of entrees and sides to select from. They also had a small, but nice selection of beer. The staff was helpful and friendly. 

My friend had the tacos and really enjoyed them. I had the brisket sandwich with mac and cheese. Wow, great flavor!

I don't make it out to Boulder City much, but next time I do, I know what I'm having for lunch."}
{"text":"Wife and I are grew up in the south so we've had our fair share of BBQ. Whenever we get a craving for some good BBQ that reminds us of home or I'm not smoking up our own BBQ at the house this is our go to place. A little pricey but well worth it for the good food. Wife loves the sliders whereas I stick with the combos."}
{"text":"I'm so sad to have to write this review today. I have been here so many times and had such great food and service; but yesterday was something totally different. Came in with three people for late afternoon lunch, we all ordered sandwiches. Brisket for me, pulled pork for the others. Can we say one sliver of meat on the brisket sandwich, and the whole thing was cold. Sweet potato fries were far from bountiful as usual, and I could literally count them in my basket. I don't care if I'm coming in for a sandwich or for a plate, you guys need to get your portions under control. I'm not going to pay good money to leave hungry and dissatisfied. Just give me a damn big ol' hot sandwich that will leave me wanting to come right back. My two other friends pulled pork was also very skimpy and wimpy and also COLD. One of my friends had to run home to the bathroom for an after meal emergency. WTF!!! To top off all of the cold skimpy tasteless food; the waitress was also COLD and not around even to refill our drinks. I'm so done with establishments that cannot be consistent or fulfilling. Consistency in the restaurant business is being consistent each and every time. One time being this off and you are no longer consistent IMHO. Pay less attention to the meat scales and LOOK at the food you are serving, and determine for yourself if that's what you would want to be served. There's nothing I hate more then a restaurant that makes $50. for $6. dollars worth of food cost. I will check back again sometime and update this review fairly; until then I'm signing off."}
{"text":"Pulled pork, brisket, cowboy beans, potato salad and buns are soooooooo good. Staff is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and it's always great.  But today, I decided to go for the ribs.  When I placed the order the friendly owner stated how they won a local rib contest with 49 contestants.  I can see why!! I've never experienced ribs so tender in my life and the flavor was dead on.  The cowboy beans were extra good too."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Best darn sweet potato fries I've ever had- and I've had a lot. We ordered a variety of things - ribs,  brisket, sandwiches. Everything was good and best of all, priced right. We're out of towners from Miami Fl and we are so happy that we knew the right local to take us here. Highly recommend this joint!"}
{"text":"I went to this place right before going to a high school football game. I have been looking for some good BBQ in the surrounding area for quite some time. Since I compare everything to the best BBQ from Kansas City, I was really optimistic about this restaurant because they are a member of the Kansas City BBQ Association. #1 star just for that. 

As soon as I pull up to the little strip mall and exit my car, all I can smell is the appropriate wood smoke smell of a pit master that understands the trade. #2 star for that. 

Entering the restaurant gives you even more of that fabulous aroma. The service was quick, friendly, and offered great suggestions. Brought our drinks right away and then proceeded to tell us about the items on the menu. I ordered the two meat (brisket and pulled pork) 2 side (Mac and cheese and cowboy beans) combo. I also got 1/2 pound of the brats to share. Everything came out beautifully prepared and presented. #3 star for that. 

The Mac and cheese was out of this world. It was so creamy and had a few nice crunchy pieces of crust that gave it enough chew. Amazing. The cowboy beans were fantastic. They were really like eating a bowl of chili. They had bits of brisket and pulled pork chopped up in them with celery and onions. Sides = spot on. #4 star here. 

The meats. No comment necessary. They had the right flavor, tenderness, juiciness, and were served dry. You add the sauce you want. Perfectly cooked meat just like Kansas City. The brats on the side were a little too much to eat, but they were a nice snack on the way home from the game.  #5 star for the meats. 

I once posted on Facebook, \"In a town of about 2.5 million people, why can't we get good BBQ?  I wish Kansas City Joe would come out here and open a restaurant.\"  This place isn't Kansas City Joe's. However, it is far and away the best BBQ in the Las Vegas area and comes closest to Joe's. You have to check this place out."}
{"text":"Hands down best BBQ. Clean, fast, friendly... And the food is soooo yummy. I had brisket, boyfriend had ribs. Nothing to complain or give constructive criticism about at all! The cole slaw not soupy or dry... Excellent flavor. Will be returning with an appetite!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch after touring Hoover Dam. I had the combo 2: pulled pork with Mac and cheese and coleslaw on the side. It was DELICIOUS! The mac and cheese has really great flavor, with green chili in it. 
Service was super friendly and fast. It's totally worth the drive over from Vegas."}
{"text":"Wow I'm originally from TN visting the Hoover Dam so we decided to stop by Fox BBQ ... First of all they have the nicest kindest staff.... I orders brisket and shredded pork .... It's the best shreded pork I've had... The brisket was amazing and very tender... I wish I had a BBQ like that in my home town....  U can't go wrong with these guys price is fair .... I'm a 230lb guy the meal was more than enough ...."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome! Beef fell off the bones. Brisket was amazing! Macaroni was awesome. Great service! So friendly and attentive! I would recommend this place to anyone who loves BBQ!"}
{"text":"This is some of the Best BBQ around. Had family in from out of state and they loved it. Awesome staff too!"}
{"text":"Fatty brisket was excellent!! I love a heavy stick burning smoke on my ribs. The ribs were mighty tender & juicy. The smoke was on the mild side for me, but it didn't stop me from cleaning the bone. I never reached for the Q sauce either. Mac & cheese w/a tang that rocks the taste buds. Cya next visit!"}
{"text":"Fox has been the only BBQ spot in the valley where I found a tasty smoked chicken sandwich for as long as I can remember. Not eating red meat makes most places like this off limits for the likes of me but Fox is inventive and it's a really excellent sandwich with all the toppings. My red meat eating friends & family say the brisket is real good too and my mate loves their pulled pork sandwich. So, the reason I deducted a star is that I just feel like good BBQ should have a companion in having an excellent potato salad and theirs falls short in my opinion. It's a mayonnaise base and seems like they're not making it fresh everyday, watery and potato texture is not good. I periodically try it hoping it will improve because in the beginning they put black olives in it and gratefully stopped that but it's still not good. On my last visit I decided to try their veggie burger but cannot recommend it because the patty was mushy and fell apart as I was eating it, seems to need some honing to get it more crispy and holding together, a binder of some sort since they make their own. In house service is always attentive, all the staff take care of you, just ask. I've been told the owners are very nice civic minded folks and I'm happy we have them here in town. If you order to go it's good to check your order when you pick up because we've gotten home missing items more that once with call in orders. They always make good on any mistake but who wants to drive back?
Great sauces here, both the regular & the spicy."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!!  The servers and Dan were great!

You get to seat yourself and it felt very homey when you walk in.  We were headed here to check it out b/c of the great reviews and the definitely delivered.  Loved the little signs on the street leading the way to yummy brisket.

My husband and I are from the south and have sampled a lot of the BBQ in the Vegas area... this place is my favorite!!  Great atmosphere, WONDERFUL food, great service, and good prices.  

I got the brisket and my husband had the pulled pork...both delicious!  LOVED the MACARONI, okra, fries, and dinner roll.  Can't wait to have more room in my tummy for all of the desserts you have to choose from.  Ribs are next on the list as well.  See y'all again soon!!"}
{"text":"Would add photos, but dug in way too fast.  Amazing smoked meats, ridiculously good glazed chicken wings... just great.  If you're running to Hoover Dam from Vegas, this is the place to stop for lunch or early dinner!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Las Vegas and They know it. If your going for Dinner call in advance to ensure they dont run out of Ribs or brisket and definitely pre-order your Yummy mac n cheese"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place.  Have not a meal we didn't love but my favorite!! BBQ chicken with the fries and their special fry sauce!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch after a trip to the Hoover Dam. They were super nice! And the brisket, mac & cheese, and potato salad didn't disappoint. The side of beans was less tasty--would say skip that one."}
{"text":"What a great place for BBQ!!  Ribs were fall off the bone good!!!
Our waitress Morgan was super friendly!!"}
{"text":"Really good ribs, and on those alone this place is an easy 4* - however, I'm not as big a fan of the brisket and pulled pork, as I found both very dry and especially the brisket lacked the smoke ring I'd expect from a place like this. But the ribs are for sure worth the drive out here for anyone in the Vegas area.

I've only been here twice, look forward to updating once I get a few more visits in."}
{"text":"Excellent place to stop and eat after a long day at the Hoover Dam. I had the brisket and pulled pork with potato salad and baked beans. For dessert I had the triple chocolate cake, which was to die for. My husband had the same meal but with mac and cheese and an order of corn bread and he recommends them all! Also owned by a fellow Vet which is also a plus in my book and he came out to say hello and made sure our meal was good."}
{"text":"The staff was very nice and always happy. The ribs fall off the bone. Burnt ends just melt in your mouth. Better than most of Kansas City BBQ I have tried. The prices are great. You definitely won't leave hungry or disappointed, we are going back again for sure"}
{"text":"We get BBQ everywhere we travel to! Got 3 meats pulled pork, ribs & brisket did not like any of the meats, however the sides were some of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"BBQ done right!  Great food and service!  The owner Dan is a solid guy & suggested a few other places to checkout in the area!  Give it a try & you won't be disappointed.  They also cater!"}
{"text":"We ordered the brisket, smoked chicken and the ribs. Everything was awesome. They offer a mild or spicy now sauce. The mild was excellent, smoky and not too sweet. If you order the sweet potato fries make sure you take the spicy mayo to dip in! They also have draft and bottle beer. The customer service is excellent!"}
{"text":"We will for sure be back. There was no wait to get seats or service. 
I got the Porky with fries. It really is big enough to share. I could only finish half of it. The fries were seasoned well and were pretty good. 
My boyfriend got the same but with the potato salad and he liked the sandwich but wasn't impressed with the potato salad. 
Definitely going to have to try some more stuff from here."}
{"text":"Chose to eat here on the way back into Vegas based on Yelp ratings.  Thank you Yelp!  Delicious food & fast, friendly service!!  Highly recommend the Mac & cheese & ribs.  The sweet potato fries were delicious too!  So glad we stopped here!!"}
{"text":"Love Fox's!!! Rib are outstanding, my husband loves the beans, and I'm a fan of all the meats available!"}
{"text":"Fox Smokehouse BBQ - Boulder City, NV

Fox Smokehouse BBQ is easily the best BBQ that I've had in Boulder City, Nevada. If you're in the area and craving some great brisket, then look no further. I prefer a moist and tender brisket. Fox got this one right. The brisket is so tender that I can eat it with a spoon. Another highlight is the cheesy mac cheese. As for the Smokehouse Burger, it's small and on the dry side. I'm sure that I will be back if I'm in the area. The brisket and mac cheese are both worth it."}
{"text":"I'd give Fox's an 11 if I could.  Best brisket, awesome pulled pork, and the sides are amazing.  The cowboy beans might as well be a small bowl of chili, very hearty and full of good stuff.  I'm not normally a fan of ribs due to a big bone and small meat but Fox's ribs are the best cut I've seen, very meaty and the flavor of the rub, the smoke and the sauce are Great.  I've been in several times and always had excellent service.  I can't say enough about How good it is.  Some day I'll order something other than the ribs and brisket but it's so hard to pass them up for anything else.  Well worth the drive for a special trip and if you're in the area already you have no excuse.  Whenever I have out of town visitors we go to the dam and stop at Fox on the way home."}
{"text":"Ribs are the thing to order here! Smokey flavor with a dry rub. Tender with just enough 'pull'.
Sides need a little more distinction. If they can add some pizazz to the sides, it would put this gem of a place over the top!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ joint. Nothing fancy, just great food! Burnt Ends are wonderful and corn bread tastes like dessert! We all enjoyed the Mac and cheese and the sauces are delicious also. The hot bbq sauce was perfect, full of flavor and with a kick."}
{"text":"It was very good! The ribs are a big hit. Come here after you have seen the Hoover Dam. The price of the meal wasn't too pricey. And they love veterans here. Staff was very friendly and nice. I would come here again"}
{"text":"Thanks for the suggestion Yelpers! Y'all were right! 

I was getting hangry and once again turned to Yelp to point me in the right direction. My pork sandwich reminded me of my Granddaddy. My Arkansas bred, put coleslaw on it and let it drip down your hands Grandaddy. The smell, the taste, took me back to childhood. So dam (couldn't resist) good! 

I could only eat half my sandwich and sweet potato fries (bonus meal!). The service was fast and the location a bit off the beaten path made this lunch visit the perfect spot. We will be back."}
{"text":"I was recommended to come to this place by Matthew and I am so glad I came. I got the BBQ pork ribs and they were delicious. The mac n cheese and fried okra were fantastic as well. The mac n cheese has five different cheeses plus chili was added and I loved it! The German chocolate brownie bites were so cute and little but good as well. Jaqueline was our waitress and she was so sweet. She was very attentive and down to earth. When we go back hopefully we will have her again."}
{"text":"Passing through from Lake Mead/Hoover Dam to Las Vegas and decided to give it a try. AH-mazing! We had the brisket and smoked turkey sandwiches with cowboy beans and French fries, which came in around $30 with tip. We left full! Their fry dip is delicious! The cowboy beans are hands-down the best baked beans I've ever had, anywhere! They have free WiFi and plenty of street parking (no shade though)."}
{"text":"Wow! I can't say enough good things about our experience here. I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and finally made my way out to Boulder City on my day off to go. Took the husband along to enjoy a meal. We didn't have any issues parking. We went for an early dinner (around 5pm). We were greeted promptly and cheerfully. We were told to choose our seats. Everything looked nice and clean and in order. We got our menus and asked a few questions. Our server was so nice and helpful in answering the questions we had. We ordered the two meat and two side combo with an extra order of Mac and cheese. The food came out very fast! We got the pulled pork and Brisket with a side of beans and fries. The brisket was amazing! Like, melt in your mouth amazing! My husband and I both lived in Tennessee before we were married so we have had lots of BBQ and this was hands down, the best we've ever had! I couldn't believe how tender the meat was! The regular sauce was our favorite but they do have a spicy option as well. The beans were delicious and the fries were crisp, seasoned well and the dipping sauce added the perfect touch of spice. The mac and cheese was incredible! It was creamier than most mac and cheese served at restaurants and had big chunks of gooey, melted cheese. It had a hint of green chilies (or some sort of pepper) which was the perfect addition and made our taste buds happy! The rolls were soft and delicious. I've pretty much dreamed about the food since that night. No joke. The service was fantastic. Our server kept the drinks filled the entire time without us even having to ask.  One thing I REALLY appreciated was the girls in the restaurant wore regular T-shirts. It seems like every eatery in BC has their girls wear the same small little tank top which I don't think is appropriate. I loved that Fox's was different and it could be about the food and experience instead of the girls. Friendly staff, clean restaurant and food that is off the charts! We will be returning without any question. Great job Fox BBQ!"}
{"text":"Their St. Louis pork ribs are delicious! I haven't had pork ribs that are as tender as the ones that they serve so I was very surprised by it. They also accidentally gave us sweet potato fries which we bought anyways but these were probably the BEST sweet potato fries I have had so far. I don't know what they seasoned it with but it was delicious. We were able to be seated immediately, it wasn't too busy and the service was good. They kept checking in on us to see if everything was okay and they came out with the food at a reasonable time. We also ordered a Caesar salad, a brisket sandwich, a tri-tip sandwich, cowboy cheese fries, mimosas and Mac n cheese sides. The mac and cheese was delicious as well and I normally don't like mac and cheese. It was all good and I was full by the end of it. We definitely had leftovers because we ordered all of this for 3 people and we could have fed 3 more people. Parking is street parking and it was easy to find parking, it wasn't that busy. I would recommend coming here to get some ribs and sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"From New Zealand, Went to the Hoover Dam and stopped off in Boulder City looking for BBQ and found this gem. Had brisket and ribs BBQ'd to perfection and the cowboy beans were best I have ever had. Staff friendly, service excellent and got a T-Shirt."}
{"text":"The food and service was AMAZING! This is Nevada's BBQ gem! The restaurant won multiple BBQ awards and it's a great place to eat after visiting the Hoover Dam. Try the Brisket Sandwich or the NEW Oklahoman sandwich. The service includes smiling, laughing and lots of positive energy. This is a great place for family. Try it, you will love it! Oh and leave room for dessert!"}
{"text":"I want to pick this restaurant up and move it to Phoenix, it was that good. Service was excellent, barbecue was amazing, and the restaurant feel was homey and warm. I ordered the Oklahoman sandwich, one of their specialties, and it was wonderful - filling and delicious. I got the Mac and cheese as a side, but I recommend the cowboy beans because those were truly amazing. For desert we got the peach cobbler which was pretty good. Overall, delicious food and all around awesome restaurant!"}
{"text":"A well deserve detour for a 5 star BBQ. Nice kick with their hot BBQ suace. Off the bone ribs, perhaps they used the boiling method prior to BBQing."}
{"text":"Excellent brisket, huge portions and attentive service."}
{"text":"Great \"Q\" 
Very fair prices. VERY attentive wait staff. 
Family loved it. Had the brisket sandwich. The brisket was very succulent. 
The only thing I would ding them on us the slaw. I'm not a fan of chopped slaw and it was a bit soupy. I prefer vinegar based and shredded/hand cut coleslaw.
Can't wait to go back if/when I get my taste back."}
{"text":"Super nice service. We arrived 45 minutes before closing and they were friendly and helpful and never made us feel rushed. Super yummy and incredibly tender BBQ ribs and brisket. They apparently smoke indoors extra long and below 300 degrees. Flavorful sweet potato fries and homestyle baked potato at Fox Smokehouse BBQ. Very set up for you getting to eat your food your way, so lots of menu combo options and you decide what to put on your potato or if you want your ribs pre-sauced spicy, pre-sauced mild, or dry. Decor features smoker and motivational quotes like \"show compassion,\" \"be grateful,\" \"dream big,\" and \"we don't dial 911.\""}
{"text":"The best smoked barbecue meat I have ever tasted. The cowboy beans were super delicious. The attention from the owners and their waitresses was very good as well. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The best pulled pork sandwich I've had. I love that everything is always fresh. The meat is always tender and delicious. The bun is always soft and never dried out. They have great potato salad and awesome mac and cheese."}
{"text":"We came here after reading the racing reviews. Its a nice little stop in a town others would otherwise pass through. I found the food to be just okay. Being from North carolina, perhaps my tastes for bbq is a bit skewed. I really was hoping for something a bit more flashy for my taste buds. The side dishes were on the salty side for me. The owner is super sweet though. He walks around to every table to make sure you are being taken care of. And the servers really do care about you. Too bad this bbq didn't live up to the race reviews :("}
{"text":"Not a 5 star at all. I was so disappointed that the  brisket was dry and too salty. I ordered a combo and had the sausage too. But i expected so much more from a place with hundreds of 5 star reviews. It was unfortunately one of my disappointments during my trip. Hopefully it's better during the busier seasons."}
{"text":"We had ribs and brisket combo and the phili brisket sandwhich! Loved it all. The side of beans and corn bread were delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ/Smokehouses I've even been to. Great variety of meats, delicious side menu options, and warm rolls. You leave smelling like the smoker and it is awesome."}
{"text":"OMG!!! This food is Amazing!!  We were on our way to Hoover Dam Lodge for our Anniversary and were hungry.  My husband spotted a sign that said BBQ with an arrow.  They Need to figure something out to place the sign higher or get a sign put up somehow, as they are off the main strip of 93, tucked on a side street.  I have NEVER tasted anything more delicious.  As soon as we pulled up, we could smell the Smoked aroma.  Was mouth watering, as was the food.  Also, the waitress we had, Amanda, was awesome!!  Such a sweet, pleasant girl with a wonderful smile.  She made the whole experience overall wonderful. You have to look for the small Orange BBQ sign and follow the arrow (right off 93, left on Elm St.) It is WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"Fox Smokehouse has fantastic food, with a lot to choose from!!! The Service was great to!!!!"}
{"text":"OMGeeeee My husband just brought the ribs and brisket home and I have never tasted anything like this in my life. I just met heaven. Omg lol I can't believe how great this food was. We've searched the Strip and all around town for good BBQ and NOTHING even came close. Bravo! 9-21-2016"}
{"text":"Loved - brisket sandwich. Mac n cheese (with chili verde)
Liked- prices
Disliked-kinda small dining area
Hated- nothing."}
{"text":"The *BEST* BBQ I've had! The pulled pork melts in your mouth and the homemade \"spicy\" sauce is outstanding. The Mac and cheese is pure delight. Soft, warm, cheesy and just enough pepper to add a good flavor. The best Mac and cheese. 

This place is amazing! Perfect lunch spot.  Friendly service and hands down the best BBQ I've bad. Being from Detroit where Slow's is touted as the best BBQ around this place puts Slow's to shame. This place is unbelievably good! 

Do yourself a favour and stop here for the most mouth-watering pulled pork with Mac and cheese you'll ever have. 

For $10 a plate you get one meat and a side that is the best BBQ you'll taste. The included roll is soft and delicious as well. 

A meal here made my stay in Boulder perfect!"}
{"text":"I was on a mission to cross state line and grab some powerball tickets in Arizona,  and I thought it would be perfect to stop here on the way to get lunch.   I had been meaning to check it out for a while,  but my plans always fell through.   It's a small unassuming establishment,  on a side road so you wouldn't just come across it unless you were looking for it.   Walking the smell was very inviting,  and I was instantly excited.   

I ordered the brisket, with coleslaw as my side and cornbread in place of a dinner roll.   The brisket was close to the best I ever had,  very tender.  The coleslaw was nicely done,  and what I would consider traditional.  The cornbread was a little sweet for my taste,  but not enough for me to dislike it.   The BBQ sauces came in regular and spicy.  The regular was a nice flavor, but  the spicy just tasted like they added a bunch of black pepper to the regular.   

My boyfriend got the sandwich called the brisket which he enjoyed,  but the fries with it were those fat wavy cut fries that are on the softer side and make me think of the ones in the school cafeteria growing up.  Not very appetizing for me personally.   

While my lottery trip did not prove to be fruitful,  trying this place overall definatly was.  It is so hard to find a place that does a brisket right, so I can't wait to go back for that again,  and try their ribs as well.   Even though it was not on a busy street,  by the time I was leaving it was filling up,  so that is a testament to what they have to offer.  Also,  as a side note some recent reviews mentioned poor service,  I did not experience this issue,  and felt adequately attended to during my lunch."}
{"text":"If you're ever in Henderson/ Boulder City go check out this place! Even if you're somewhat around the area take the time and head over there! Award winning bbq joint. I had the ribs, fall off the bone tender and spicy bbq sauce was tasty. I also had the potato salad which was great but the icing on the cake was their mac and cheese! Oh boy the mac and cheese, I had to get a large side order to go they were so darn delicious!! My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and he devoured it. The staff was also very friendly abd the owner of the place even mingled with customers and came by our table and told us the history of their bbq. Also his secret ingredient to his oh so yummy mac and cheese but I'm not telling!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. We did the family meal and enjoyed everything. Thanks for having this great option during our baseball tournament."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome! We brought our party of 35 with a moments notice and they were fantastic! The family meals were great!! Especially the mac and cheese! The Brisket melted in your mouth!! Chicken and ribs were wonderful! My husband had the burnt ends and cowboy fries, it was all incredible!"}
{"text":"This is what BBQ is all about. Everything is good here. You can't go wrong, just eat here and you'll see what I'm talking about. It only took me eating here once and I'm hooked!!

I always get the same thing because it's so damn delicious: Brisket sandwich with coleslaw on top (the sandwich comes on texas toast). They have perfected this combination of juicy and mouth watering tender meat. Even their BBQ sauce is awesome. Not too thick or watery in consistency.

Sliders are really good here and bonus you can order each one with a different meat. Buns are super soft, yummy, and a little buttery(top bun).
Also, toppings on the sliders: onion, pepperoncini peppers, coleslaw, and pickles. 

Sides are yummy: 
1. Fries: Are cooked to perfection. Crispy on the outside, but moist and flavorful on the inside. And to top it off the amazing seasoning sprinkled on them. : ) You can't have just one.
2. Potato Salad: Perfect amount of flavor, without a lot of mayonnaise.
Bonus, has a hint of black olive that adds a bit of a crunch factor. Never had black olive in potato salad, but man is this a nice touch!
3. Mac N Cheese: Super amazing cheesiness! It has a lot of flavor, almost a southern flavor with an addition of being baked. Very filling in itself!
4. Coleslaw: Has a great flavor and isn't drowned in mayonnaise. I hate when all you taste is mayonnaise. You get a great cabbage flavor and followed by a great crunch.
5. Beans: Have yet to try. Will be ordering next time."}
{"text":"This a small BBQ off the main drag. It building is the only thing that is small. Walked in with my mother and took a table. The waitress came right over for our drink order and then came back to help mom with the menu. I ordered the two meat meal with ribs and brisket. The brisket was good but the ribs were very close to the best I have ever had. This little BBQ is now on my must hit list anytime I go to Vegas"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Had the rib combo, meat is super tender and falls off the bone. Excellent service also. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"You have to try this place! Food is fantastic, staff is amazing. If you are a fan of BBQ and anywhere near Boulder City you need to run, not walk to this establishment. I have tried nearly everything on the menu, not a clunker among them."}
{"text":"Ribs - fall off the bone awesome 
Brisket - slick like a hot knife through butter 
Chicken - seasoned to perfection 
We were driving from Grand Canyon to Vegas .   After stopping at Hoover dam to find this place less than 15 mins from the dam wasn't sure ... But it was damn amazing . Owner cane out explained menu and how ribs are prepared . Great great food"}
{"text":"We found this bbq place using Yelp and it earned it's 5 star rating in spades!    The brisket was moan worthy.  The service was the heat seeking missile of happiness and the sides excellent!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ. They really know what they're doing. The ribs were phenomenal, as were the other meats we got. Cowboy beans were surprisingly good too."}
{"text":"Went again. Loved it again. We brought our two kids and the staff were all so nice and kind to them even though they were a bit rowdy (despite our best efforts). Telling friends, referring people. Keep up the good work and we'll see you again soon."}
{"text":"Wife and I landed in Vagas rented a car and drove staight to Fox smokehouse BBQ. We truly Love this little hole in the wall. It's the best BBQ I've ever found.
Great prices and generous portions.
Best part 1 dollar PBR Beers."}
{"text":"After reading the comments from other people who have been there, I decided to give this place a try.  Once I entered that restaurant, the aroma of the place was mouth  watering.  I ordered a number 2 combo which is one choice of meat with two sides.  I ordered pull pork with mac and cheese and thick slice fries.  The pull pork was cooked to perfection, mac and cheese was awesome.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to try a great barbecue."}
{"text":"The brisket here maybe the best I've tasted ever. Being from Mississippi, I've had the best around. (That's a lie-I'm from NE...)
BUT, if I was from Mississippi, I would probably think my grand pappy cooked these. (Another lie- my grandpa couldn't boil water)
Anywaaaay, seriously, this was just great tasting food after a day riding HD's thru the desert. Real friendly people here too!
Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is very good and the help is great. Super positive energy and very attentive. 

Every time I drive within distance of this place I'll be stopping by."}
{"text":"Omg omg OMG!!!! So glad we stumbled across this place while visiting Boulder City. With the help of Yelp! Of course

This place is spectacular! Upon entering the have all the bbq comps they entered on their window and have won hence the awesome food they serve. Inside is not super big but has a good ambience feel. The menu has a good amount of items to choose from Sandwiches and regular bbq such as ribs, brisket, etc. Yummm!!!
Our server was awesome with recommendations on the menu. I wish I could remember his name! He was also super friendly and looked liked he enjoyed his job,  breathe of fresh air.

They some regular kids items for those picky kids like chicken tenders, grilled cheese. 

Me and my bf opted for the bbq combo #4 (2 meats, 2 sides & 2 rolls) $18. Choices were ribs, brisket, mac&cheese and baked beans, everything we had was super ono!!!! (Delicious) my brother in law had The Porky sandwich $10. 

Everything was so good but made us so stuffed didn't have room for the homemade peach cobbler.  We definitely will be back again and will make that cobbler a must!!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars. Omg, I've been told that this place was the bomb...based on my 1st visit it has become our new favorite bbq joint!  Burnt ends - yum. Macaroni and cheese was very good. $4 pitchers of PBR! We loved it. Worth the drive from Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My friends and I got to try this place yesterday while exploring Bolder City and it was the perfect place to stop for lunch! We ordered two meats by the pound and three sides to share. Here's what we tried....

Ribs - Pretty darn tender and nice flavor!

Brisket - Served sliced. Not quite as tender as the ribs, but still good. 

Sweet Potato Fries - So amazingly crunchy and perfectly seasoned! Not many places do sweet potato fries this well!

Regular Fries - I couldn't tell what exactly was on the Seasoning, but it was nice!

Coleslaw - It was chopped pretty fine and had that sweet, creaminess I like. 

All in all, we had a great time and would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Ribs, brisket, tri tip sandwich, mac and cheese, and coleslaw!!! Some of the best BBQ I've ever had. Meat falls off of the bone on the ribs. Brisket melts away. Sides were delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Came across this place after doing the Hoover dam tour and the bridge walk. There were five of us and I was able to try the brisket, pork and chicken. All were very good! Now, I'm from eastern NC and only they have real BBQ but the puller pork was pretty damn good. Also tried the fried okra and Mac and cheese. Both were very good also. Definitely a 10/10, willing to make a trip back from NC just to eat here."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! For the moment you walk up to the door. The smoke flavor lofting in the air, Great service and the brisket is to die for! Must experience!"}
{"text":"Very small, takeout type of location, with a half dozen tables if you want to dine in.  Meats by the pound,  family dinners, lunch specials are available for a reasonable price.  I had the pulled pork sandwich with the side of cowboy beans.  The beans are amazing, and the pulled pork was tender.  Our sandwiches were served dry as we ate in, and mild and spicy sauce is on the table.  Spicy is spicy!  But good.  Potato salad was great, and we ended up getting brisket to go.  Two lunch specials with a drink ran us $25."}
{"text":"We ordered right before closing one evening and took it to go. We ordered ribs, brisket, and chicken. We loved the meats and sauces. Unfortunately all of my sides were inedible. I think because we were basically closing them out, it seemed like the sides had been sitting in warmers all day and we got the bottom of the barrel. the baked potato was a funky grey color on the inside and burnt and the mac and cheese was soggy and just a weird texture. My friend's sweet potato fries were freshly made and delicious. I liked that the sauces weren't too sweet and I love meat so still gave this a good 4 stars and recommend it if you are in the area."}
{"text":"best barbecue since coming to vegas one year ago.  it beats all the big chains.  we had the pulled pork sandwiches.  it was done just right, crispy but juicy.  the home made sauce was so good.  we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best bbq I've had in a longggg time! Mac and cheese and cowboy fries are an absolute must! Great friendly service! So glad we stopped in on our way to Hoover dam! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"We just arrived in town and were recommended this location just around the corner from our camp spot.  They are located on a side street in a strip mall but have most of the building.  It was rated high on Yelp, so we couldn't lose.  They were very busy, but we were able to get a table easily.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.

I ordered the tacos with brisket and pork.  These came with a side of okra.  It was recommended to try the honey mustard with the okra so I went that way and it was very good.  The tacos were a weird offering.  It was like a BBQ sandwich but on a tortilla with lettuce and tomato.  It came with a side of sour cream also.  I ended up deconstructing the tacos and eating them with a fork.  The sour cream didn't add anything so I added the regular BBQ sauce to the meat which was great.  I tried my husband's mac and cheese which was also very tasty.

I would recommend Fox's but be prepared to smell like BBQ for the rest of the day when you leave."}
{"text":"There is a delicious barbecue smell that is sweeping across Boulder City. The barbecue smell is originating from the smoker of a hot and local barbecue restaurant called Fox's Barbecue. Okay, I'm slightly exaggerating. The reality is that there is a delicious barbecue smell sweeping over Elm Street in Boulder City that leads into a mom and pop barbecue restaurant that serves first-rate barbecue food. 

   Fox Barbecue is is on the off the beaten path along a dead-end side street named Elm Street. Without the Internet and social media, in all honesty, I would not have known this place exists. 

   The Internet through the Fox Barbecue (used interchangeably with BBQ) website commemorates the Fox Barbecue accomplishments in the barbecue community. According to their website, the owners Dan and Kelly Fox are a BBQ competition team from Boulder City. This very BBQ competition team are members of the Kansas City BBQ Society. After reading this, I was confident that Fox Barbecue was the real deal and anti-Sysco. Without regard to the Dan and Kelly Fox name in the barbecue community, it was the Yelp reviews that advertised Fox Barbecue. Through their enthusiastic and informative reviews my Yelp friends convinced me to try Fox Barbecue. 

   In Yelp friends I trust. That trust led to Fox Barbecue after hiking the Historic Railroad Tunnel Trail on May 15. I'd return on May 23. This review captures both experiences. 

   I started this review half-joking that there is a barbecue smell that is sweeping across Boulder City from Fox Barbecue. If that were the case this would be an easy place to find. Parking is a bigger challenge. There is only street parking on Elm Street that requires an extended walk. The first time I parked by the Firehouse and the second in the former Von's-anchored shopping center at the southwest corner of US 93 and Buchanan Drive. 

   Once I got out of my car and close to the entrance I laid eyes on the Fox Barbecue landmark. It is the smoker. What makes the Fox Barbecue experience unparalleled is that some of the barbecuing takes place in front of the house. That is in a smoker on the sidewalk. This gave me a remarkable first and last impression. I knew that the barbecue dinner was real. This is the antithesis of seeing a Sysco truck out front. 

   Inside, the pictures and interior of the two room full-service restaurant remind me of a road trip diner. I felt like I was in a Diner off US 66 more than in a mom &  pop barbecue restaurant off a side street in Boulder City. The porcelain pig holding breath mints exemplifies the environment. Now, the menu and food exemplified good old American barbecue. 

   The centerpiece of the menu are the combo meals. They range from $10 to $20. On May 15, I ordered the $15 meal that included two meat and one side. It was difficult making a decision. My meat choices were ribs, chicken, brisket (50 cents additional), pulled pork, and Bratwurst. I decided on ribs and chicken with French fries. The fact that I overheard a waitress tell a customer that they are known for their pulled pork and brisket did not persuade me to switch. 

  The $15 meal was allright. The ribs were fine and easy on the napkins. They featured just the right amount of barbecue sauce which saved a lot of napkins. Interestingly, the chicken was cut into pieces. The previous times that I chowed down barbecue chicken it was a breast, thigh, or leg. This was different just like the smoker on the sidewalk. The French fries were filler to extend the bites of barbecue food. 

  The barbecue experience was so flavorful, that it left this taste in my mouth that brought me back here after a hike in the Teddy Bear Cholla Forest on May 23. This time I ordered the Smoke House burger. It was $10. I have yet to visit a barbecue place or steak house that failed to serve an outstanding burger. Fox's didn't let me down. The Smoke House burger was a delectable amalgamation of Angus beef and season brisket with Colby cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, and BBQ Mayo. 

  Both times that I visited, the service was satisfactory. Both waitresses were on top of the Coke refills. Additionally, they filled up a cup of Coke for the drive back. 

   In conclusion, my Yelp friends and other Yelpers did me right by leading me here. In the future, I would like to return to Fox Barbecue for visits that will include trying the brisket and pulled pork with Cole slaw then their chicken parmesain sandwich. If this happens it will be in the cooler months of 2016-2017.



Below is the picture tour from May 15 & May 23."}
{"text":"I don't know why there's a lot of 5stars review. Wasn't that great as expected. Don't get me wrong, the place is nice and clean; the staff are great, attentive and friendly. The ribs were dry and not fall off the bone, it was kinda hard to bite. The brisket were great and tender, I like that one. Their fries were good too and Mac and cheese taste homemade good. Chicken was tender too and tasty. Just really disappointed with the ribs and the amount of serving for the price. Ordered cornbread too which came cold and hard, not warm at all not soft either even with generous amount of butter. Butter actually just sat on top and did not melt at all because it was that cold."}
{"text":"I am from Birmingham Alabama and I know good BBQ. This is hands down the best BBQ place in the Vegas area. Not only is the BBQ good, so are the sides. Sometimes you can get good BBQ but crappy sides. Not here! Everything is homemade. Mac n cheese is awesome and so are the beans and slaw. Chocolate cake is awesome also. I high recommend this place. The people that own/work here are amazing. Thank you for bringing awesome BBQ to the Vegas area! My stomach salutes you!"}
{"text":"We are brisket lovers.  We've had brisket all over the south and love tasting the different ways it is smoked.  When we saw the \"brisket\" sign, we just couldn't pass it up.  Naturally we have our favorite places so I didn't really want to give this place 5 stars.  However, that's exactly what I'm doing. 
The brisket portion was generous and it was so tender it just melted in your mouth.  Besides that you could certainly taste that smoked flavor with every little bite.  It was delicious.

We also tried the coleslaw and the cowboy beans.  The coleslaw just happened to be about the best we'd ever tasted.  It was creamy and perfectly mixed.  The beans had a little spice to them but they were also very good.

Service was good but when asked for our bill server went to get it but stopped to wait on others before she finished with us.  I wasn't pleased and I felt I needed to walk to the counter so we could check out.  I would have knocked the stars down one notch except that the brisket was SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ. Get there early for beef ribs because they sell out quickly. All of the dishes are fresh and tasty. The. Wet is cheap and the service is friendly!"}
{"text":"I hate writing one star reviews, especially of places that in the past have been so good. But things have changed at Fox Smokehouse BBQ and not for the better. Service has been not as good as it used to be. On our last visit we didn't get the sides we ordered for my son's kids meal. Next complaint: cold cornbread. Seriously, who wants cold cornbread? I sure don't but that's what was brought to the table. Unacceptable. Portion sizes have also started to shrink from what we're used to and at one point either myself or our friends were ordering from them up to 3x per week so we're very familiar with what to expect on carry out orders. 

But on top of that the meat itself doesn't seem to be prepared with the same care and attention to detail that it used to. For a place that has Kansas City BBQ Society plaques on the wall and since I'm from KC and personally know some of KC's legendary BBQ pit masters the drop in quality caught my attention. Dry brisket. And what happened to the tri-tips? And please serve food that is warm at the very least. Especially the cowboy beans. Our last order which came out of the kitchen at 6:30 pm on a Thursday evening was borderline cold. 

Again I absolutely HATE writing this review. My wife and I loved this place, so much so that we would deal with the legendary Boulder City traffic mess to go out and pick it up or to eat in if time permitted. But now both my wife and I agree it's not worth going back to. I hope they can turn things around, but for my family we're writing them off as a BBQ option for us."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out & it was only so-so.  Friends told me how great this place was.  Guess maybe you need to eat inside the restaurant, right after they cook it"}
{"text":"They have very friendly staff! This was my first time eating here, and I felt comfortable the whole time. Brisket and pulled pork are excellent, and they offer as much extra sauce as you'd like. Their spicy BBQ is much better than mild, and isn't soo hot that you need to be cautious. :p"}
{"text":"Superb bbq spot. Had the combo with pulled pork and brisket. Wow. Sooo tender and flavorful. Sides cowboy beans and mac cheese were yummy too. They have their own smokers. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Good food great staff and fair prices. If your hungry stop here. Indoor outdoors seating."}
{"text":"This was an unexpected find, but it was oh-so-good!!!! We tried the brisket and ribs. The meat literally fell apart at the touch of a fork! We're not big meat eaters but we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"It's pretty good.. bbq smell fills the air... but they use ALOT of salt.. too much. I'm not a hamster and I don't need a salt lick.. we went a few times, and honestly that's why we stopped going. BBQ has potential though"}
{"text":"Good service, good food and good drinks. It's a smaller place and they were pretty much full when our party of 8 got here.but everything went well! It's also reasonably priced! If you like BBQ or not, you need to come here. And to be honest - I don't really like BBQ. I got the Hawaiian chicken sandwich ( so thing like that) so good!!!!!"}
{"text":"My meal was awesome ! Have the number one combo meal. Cowboy cheese fries with brisket. Meet was tender, cowboy fries were perfect. I am by no means a barbecue person but,  I will definitely come back here!! Worth the trip to Boulder city from Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas and their brisket tacos were the best I ever had. The service was excellent! Definitely worth stopping for."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place in boulder city!! I ordered the brisket sliders with slaw, it was the best decision I've made in a long time."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ we've ever had! I'm rarely impressed enough to write a review, however this place deserves 5 stars. We will definitely be making more trips to BC just so we can eat here. Also, Facio (our server) was one of the most friendly and genuine people I have ever met. He really made the experience even more enjoyable than it already was."}
{"text":"Found this off the beaten path, but wow what a great find!  The staff were super friendly and very attentive. I had the ribs spicy-superb. So render the neat fell off the vines and the sauce has nice smooth heat and great flavor. Friend had the brisket and brats. Also super delicious. Try this place. It's a must!!"}
{"text":"Went again today, same results. There are not many choices around so YES this is good.
Pulled pork and brisket the best around Henderson/boulder area. Beans were tasty! Tri-tip and Mac and chz I would NOT recommed. Friendly easy parking. EVERYTHING is in Styrofoam. $1 tab pbr.. several bottle beer. Very small, which was nice. NO greens. The meat was tender, a bit dry, but I'm guessing it's to appeal to the general public, Sauces available on the table to wet to your liking. Almost gave 4 stars, but the tri tip and Mac and chz. Were way off compared to the rest we tried."}
{"text":"5-star.  Mentioned to waitress we were splitting, they cut the sandwich for us. Served in two basket with sides. DELISH!"}
{"text":"Great Mac'n'Cheese!!! Waitress was very good and recommended to Oklahoman, which was amazing! Go hungry, the portions are hearty!"}
{"text":"You will not find better bbq. This is by far the best I've ever had. Everything on their menu is great tasting. If you are anywhere in the area you must stop here and eat. I've been all over the country and was very surprised to find the best bbq to be located in Nevada."}
{"text":"For sure 5 stars.  This place is off the main road but the food is AWESOME. The meat is so moist and the service is wonderful.  So impressed with this place."}
{"text":"3 stars for the pulled pork, kinda dry. Ordered a full slab of ribs expecting baby back ribs (pork), Probably my mistake, but they are actually spare  ribs which were more fat than meat-2 stars. The cowboy beans were ok. But if your expecting BBQ beans that are sweet you will be sadly disappointed. 2 stars. Sweet tea tasted like powdered tea. Now for the only reason I will go back (and I will) the brisket sandwhich is heaven on bread, It is the hardest meat to cook correctly and Fox BBQ cooks it to perfection. Best brisket I have ever tasted just amazing in texture and flavor. I cant say enough how good it was.------- Post edited to reflect spare ribs and not beef ribs. I was wrong in my assumption."}
{"text":"Off the beaten track but excellent. Worth looking for. Because of light eating habits I get a quarter pound of chicken in a cup to go with spicy sauce. Just perfect"}
{"text":"Fox's is phenomenal! Food is never a disappointment and the staff and Dan treat you like family. The ribs fall off the bone and the potato salad is on point. There's no better BBQ in Nevada!"}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite BBQ joint. The service/staff are on point and extraordinarily friendly, the food is just unbelievably good. I work out in Boulder City twice a week and now eat here twice a week. Couldn't recommend this place any harder.

Definitely try the brisket, ribs, burger and those cowboy fries!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ!!!!!!! Makes the best known bbq in Vegas taste amateur. Service is fast and very friendly. The only disappointment is the prices have gone up and portions down. I had the two meat combo, I was disappointed to find I got a basket full of fries for $16.00 ($1 extra for sweet potatoes ) you can and have done better Fox's please don't out price yourselves. Stay humble and delicious"}
{"text":"We found this gem by the grace of Yelp and Mapquest.  I promise you that it is worth the drive! The food was AMAZING!  Brisket melted in your mouth, bratwurst on point, and the Mac n cheese phenomenal.  That review is based just off of what I tasted off my families plates! I had a burger that was a mix of brisket and ground chuck that was amazing. It is a little off the beaten path, but well worth it. I always prefer to support independent businesses to chains anyway, but the owner of this establishment seemed so nice and is really turning out quality food.
I promise you will be hooked."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic we had Mel as our server. She showed us everything on the menu and took our time with my difficult family. Place has a homey feel, great music and not to mention the great BBQ smell. This place deserves nothing less than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Probably the best bbq I have ever had the pleasure of eating. The service was just as good as the food and I don't sugarcoat anything. I know I will be here again."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD. Forgo Hoover Damn Cafe and drive yourself here for lunch instead. Get the Mac n cheese (it's insane). Get the brisket. Get the ribs. Get the Oaklahoman. Get the cornbread. You won't regret any of it. Delicious down home food with a super casual atmosphere - think plastic cups and silverware...aka, exactly what you want for a lunch in the desert!"}
{"text":"This is a bbq lovers dream. Had the two meat combo with ribs and brisket and it was smoked to perfection. Portions are big and prices are great! Friendly staff to boot!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Mac n cheese has a nice little spice and the beans are loaded with meat.  Brisket was my fave. Owners and staff are very friendly.   A little off the path but worth it 100%."}
{"text":"If you like barbecue you most definitely need to try this place!  It has the best pulled pork and brisket in town. I ordered a few different meats when my friends came in town and they said they will definitely have to have it next time they are in town. And if you don't have time to sit down go ahead and order to go."}
{"text":"Delicious barbecue.. ! Soooo good! Highly recommend their coleslaw. Amazing service...Felt welcomed as soon as we walked in the door!"}
{"text":"The BBQ here is phenomenal! Definitely worth the drive from Vegas!!! The tri-tip sandwich is a must and the brisket just melts in your mouth!!!"}
{"text":"Incredible BBQ place, their food is the epitome of \"down home cooking\". The ribs are probably my favorite thing on the menu, they literally fall off the bone and are so incredibly flavorful. I also love the beef jerky and I'm not even a jerky lover, they do something special so it's not tough and overly chewy, just perfectly smoked and delicious to the tastebuds. Their sandwiches are great too, I don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ, great food and staff! My order was slightly wrong, no big deal really, and their staff went out of their way to make it right, more than needed. The owner even came out to make sure everything was right. You don't often find service like that. I highly recommend this family-owned restaurant over the big name barbecue places."}
{"text":"Service here was great. Food was delicious and Betsy was my server and she was very professional and  had a great sense of humor. Really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The five stars is exclusively for the incredible smell radiating outside of the building. Legit HEAVENLY! I didn't want to like this place that much just because they have 5 stars haha! But man is this place worth all of the hype! It's super small inside but the wait staff was absolutely fabulous! They treated the easy to spot regulars and the out of towners the same, it was fabulous! We never had to want for a refill. The pulled pork fell apart as soon as it hit your tongue, so tender and delightful. Their french fries were perfectly crunchy and amazeballs dipped into their amazing fry sauce. Their ranch was also delicious. Hubby got burnt ends and was completely pleased after working in a Smokehouse for years. This has literally been the best BBQ we have ever had. We cannot wait to come back. The only gripe I have is that I didn't really like their mac n cheese, but I'm picky. Definitely stop in if you're in the area, totally worth it!"}
{"text":"...I don't do many write ups on yelp very often but when I do it's usually because of quality and/or service. This bbq place was really awesome. I enjoyed their 2 slider combo with a soda. One of the sliders was bratwurst and the other was bbq brisket. I ordered both with all toppings and trimmings. I told em make it mild but wild. I'm certainly coming back to this place. Service was awesome and didn't wait for very long. I had my order to go and ate it in my hotel room on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Seriously the most legit bbq in southern Nevada. Burnt ends are spectacular, pulled pork melted in my mouth.  The freakin staff was super welcoming and way helpful. Green Chile Mac and cheese , baked beans and slaw all were awesome as well. Looks like I have to drive to boulder to get my que on!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant! I had smoked chicken, macaroni and cheese and coleslaw. Everything was delicious. I was so impressed with the service too. The owner came by the table to ask me if I enjoyed my meal. He was a very nice man. The waitress kept my drink full at all times and she was very helpful when I asked questions about the menu."}
{"text":"Every bite was fantastic!!! The meat falls off the bone. We enjoyed ribs, brisket and pulled pork. 
Awesome Mac n Cheese and beans to compliment the meat."}
{"text":"You've got to get the ribs if you stop here.  They were fantastic, tender, meat falling off the bone and tasty.  If you spend an hour in this place, your clothes will remind you that you were here.  If you are the only one who orders ribs, get the full slab because everyone else will beg you for a rib or 2 because of all of the good food noises you will be making and everyone else will b wishing they had gotten the ribs.

They have won numerous awards for their ribs in many prestigious contests and cmpetition"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Bloody Mary's are on point! Food was very good and not overpriced! Great place to to grab a quick casual meal if you love BBQ."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this hospitable place. The ribs fell off the bones. The brisket was tender and delicious. The beans and mac & cheese were great. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I'd had their food several times in the past but today was the 1st time I was in the restaurant. They were all so friendly! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best ribs I've ever had, hands down. great beans and Mac n cheese, very good brisket and tri tip, good prices. Over all a 9.4 out of 10 for bbq, I will definitely be back when passing that way."}
{"text":"Great food and terrific service.  The ribs and brisket were smoked but not over smoked, which take a true smoke master.  The BBQ sauce was good.  With one spicy and the other sweet.  Good job.  Kinda out of the way but worth looking for it."}
{"text":"Truly a great meal and the owner even took us for a tour of the kitchen great place to eat"}
{"text":"We have been here twice and will keep coming back for more. The staff is friendly and make an effort to get to know their customers. The service is pretty quick and the food comes out hot&delicious. We have had the ribs, brisket and chicken. All delicious. The sides we have tried are the cowboy beans, mac&cheese and potato salad. Again, all delicious. Add some cornbread to the mix&dinner is made. & whatever you do, do NOT leave without trying the chocolate cake... WOW! 

You will spend some money, but nothing that empties your wallet and it is definitely worth it. We always leave with leftovers to enjoy later on in the day or the next day. 

Yum! Yum! Yum!"}
{"text":"It was all kinda delicious.  Off the path small town barbecue.  Really good! & Service is fantastic too. Genuine smiles and attentive."}
{"text":"I got the tri-tip and enjoyed every bite. The waitress was nice and there wasn't a long wait or a big crowd for lunch time. Didn't love the location, in what seemed like wear houses, but worth the drive for the food."}
{"text":"Back for our yearly pass through. Just like back home, east coast, southern bbq. You must come here!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I used Yelp to find this place after spending a half day at Hoover Dam.  We had not eaten all day, so we were pretty hungry. All of the reviews on yelp seemed very favorable, and being barbeque fans and backyard smokers, we decided to give it a go. Best culinary decision of the whole vacation!! When we walked in, Lisa gave us a friendly greeting, and I showed her a picture of my latest batch of ribs. She called to her boss, Dan Fox, the owner and pitmaster. Dan and Lisa were very friendly, and the four of us talked smoke rings for a few minutes before we got down to business.
The special that day was a \"Barbecue Burger\", or maybe it was a \" Smokehouse Burger\", and Dan explained that it was made by adding the scraps from their smoked beef briskets to ground beef and then grilling up the patties like you would with a normal hamburgers. OK! So now we have our first item! I then asked Dan how his ribs are. To answer me he showed me a trophy plaques that read: \"2015 Las Vegas Rib Fest Invitational - Ribs - Best in Show.\" First place ribs? Lol, bring them on!
The burger was fabulous, but the Ribs, people, the RIBS! Best I've ever had, and I make pretty darn good ribs. They present the ribs \"dry\", of course - no sauce, but they have homemade sauce in regular and hot, so you can play around with those if you wish. Great sauce! For sides we had Mac 'n Cheese and his Baked Beans. Also off the hook. Topped it off with $1 PBR!
Folks, I'm 51 and I've eaten a lot of BBQ, and Dan Fox's outfit easily ranks as my favorite. 
Great food, friendly folks, and great value too!
EAT AT FOX SMOKEHOUSE BBQ!!"}
{"text":"Everything was great! The baked beans and apple dessert thing were my faves. The owner came by to check on us. He was super sweet."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of BBQ then Fox Smokehouse BBQ is definitely worth a stop, even if you don't live in Boulder City!!!!
As I walked in I couldn't help but notice all the trophies on display. From what I read, they compete in lots of contests showing their skills all across the western part of the US. It tells me how serious they are about BBQ and their constant drive to improve on their craft.

I ordered the two meat plate consisting of the Brisket, Pulled Pork and as sides Mac&Cheese and Cowboy Beans. 
The Brisket here is the best have ever had and I have scoured all over Vegas! The taste is simple, salty, fatty, meaty and undeniably pure. I didn't have to use much BBQ sauce, the flavor held its own. I could say that for pulled pork too, unbelievably tender and moist.  

The Cowboy Beans are from leftover meats that has the smoky, meaty qualities infused the beans and produced a deeply flavored and hearty dish, this is a popular side.
Mac & Cheese was creamy and nicely balanced, I mixed some pulled pork in it and took it to another level.

The people there are so nice and helpful they made sure I had have a good experience.
It's a bit of drive to get there, but it's worth it. Fox is tucked away in one of the quietest areas of Clark County, its off the beaten path even for Boulder City. Gives you chance to explore Boulder City rich culture.   

Fox Smokehouse BBQ is must for any foodie!!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had! I Love the pulled pork, Mac & Cheese and Texas Beans! I could eat there everyday, but try not to! It's a great place! Staff is very friendly. Oh and the desserts! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food! We had a  family style meal with lots to choose from. I'm big into Bbq & smoked meats... It was perfect!"}
{"text":"Beef Ribs baby! We've sampled the spare ribs, brisket, cowboy beans, and the sweet potato fries and they are all outstanding. The cowboy beans are a guilty pleasure of mine - they are spicy, sweet, smokey, and incredibly addictive. 

But on the occasions they make beef ribs that's what we go for. We've tried to find good beef ribs all over Vegas and been disappointed since Truc U BBQ is no more. Hands down these are the best beef ribs you'll find. They are fall off the bone tender, not too fatty, smokey, with a robust beefy taste that borders on sweet. 

Ambiance is causal, friendly, and comfy. The service is always excellent with a friendly and responsive wait staff.

They are now making the beef ribs on Saturdays so I would suggest getting a full rack, you'll be amazed how much you'll eat. Meat candy baby!"}
{"text":"This place is the best BBQ place we have found out here! My husband and I both had the #4 combo plates so we could try their brisket, chicken and pork.  All of their meat was moist and just fell apart and melted in your mouth.  My husband had the cheese fries and I had the sweat potato fried...excellent! 

The little restaurant was clean and open, not crammed with tables and chairs taking up walking space.  They had a nice set up out side for seating as well. 

The girls working there were smiling, fun and helpful.  They actually seemed to enjoy their job (which I don't seem to run into much out here).

Bottom line we will become regulars for sure and we will be taking our friends and family there often!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food, great service all wrapped up with a rustic ambiance.  You will leave with satisfied taste buds and a slight bar be que scent wafting with you.  Good for families, groups or on your own.  Highly recommend the brisket and cowboy beans."}
{"text":"Best bbq in boulder city. The customer service  is always great and the place smells heavenly of smoke bbg."}
{"text":"I love BBQ & now I love Fox Smokehouse BBQ!!! The ribs melted in my mouth and the sausages was fabulous with mustard! I'm not a big beans fan, but daaaaamnnn they were delish!!!! I'm so happy we decided to drop by during our trip to Hoover Dam!"}
{"text":"Amazing example of BBQ food. Highly recommended. Got the brisket and chicken combo with mac and cheese. The corn bread is to die for."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ! Definitely coming back next time I'm in Vegas. So so good. Reasonable prices and great food"}
{"text":"True BBQ - found via Yelp and due to the general good reviews we decided to stop by on the way back to Vegas after a short drive to Hoover Dam.

We were surprised by the Texas size orders when doing combos. 

Combo#2 one Meat two sides each and 1/2 a rack on the side - boy are we full.

Would recomend this place anytime  

Well a Big Well done from Denmark is at it's place"}
{"text":"Second time here and it's better than ever. The brisket is our fave. Smokehouse burger is amazing as is the brisket philly. Fries dipped in ranch . We will visit every time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Adorable little spot of the main path. The staff are always super friendly. The food is ohhhh sooo goood! I've had a variety of things from various sandwiches to huge tacos to a super savory mac n cheese. They serve alcohol as well,  really cheap pitchers of PBR, along with margaritas and others. The portions are hefty and the prices are good. Definite stop in Boulder"}
{"text":"We recently stopped in at Fox Smokehouse Bbq after visiting the Southern Nevada Railway, and it was fantastic!!  The brisket was moist and tender, the burnt ends were cooked exactly as you would expect, and the ribs were delicious!! The staff was great too.  Our server was very friendly and attentive, and even the owner stopped by to check on us and chat about bbq for a while. We recently moved to Henderson, and will definitely be making a trip back out to Fox Smokehouse Bbq!!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch coming back from Hoover Dam headed to Las Vegas. What a find! Baby Back ribs that did fall off the bone. 5 cheese Mac & Cheese was incredible. The baked beans were divine, and service was capped off with  great wait staff Jacqueline. This is a must stop for BBQ and great local cuisine. You might cap it off with the German Chocolate cake squares warmed, and vanilla ice cream. Incredible."}
{"text":"SOOOOOOO GOOD. This place lives up to it's Yelp reputation. We came here after visiting the Hoover Dam which I assume is the reason why most people pass by Boulder City. We ordered 1/2 lbs of the brisket, pulled pork and pork ribs. In my opinion the pulled pork wasn't as good as the other two but it was still better than average pulled pork. They've also got a bunch of awards from BBQ competitions all over the shop. You have to eat here if you are passing by!"}
{"text":"I saw a promtional story about Fox's Smokehouse Barbecue on channel 8's afternoon program, \"Vegas Now.\"  The owner, Dan Fox explained the intricacies of cooking great barbecue food and the process of dry rub seasoning versus just covering meat in bbq sauce. His quote was something along the lines of, \"If it's covered in sauce you're hiding something!\" During the story, the ch. 8 t.v. personality J.C. Fernandez taste tested all of Fox's tasty selections and his hilarious and over the top reactions convinced me to go and try it out. I drove out to Boulder City with a friend and suggested we have lunch at Fox's. Wow! The food was better than we ever expected. The meat just melts in your mouth and the seasoning is perfect. My friend and I ordered two different sandwiches - the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken and the Brisket Philly. Both were outstanding. We even traded halves so we could both try 2 different meals in one visit. The sides were delicious too. She had mac 'n cheese and I had the potato salad. We were very impressed. The atmosphere is comfortable and casual and impeccably clean. The wait staff is terrific too. They are personable, friendly, kind and helpful. We went back a couple weeks later and tried two new dishes, the Burnt Ends and the Oklahoman with cole slaw and the mac n cheese again. Every bit of it was delicious and we got to meet and chat with the owner, Dan. What a great guy! Can't wait to go back and try something new from their delicious menu. You will love it!"}
{"text":"The meat is very good. The prices are very reasonable. The entire staff is very pleasant. They could use a better variety of sides."}
{"text":"If you love smoked bbq then this is the place to stop if your passing thru.    I had the combo plate of the smoker and I almost took a bite of my fingers :)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! We took take out and even the fries still tasted great. My boyfriend LOVED the baked beans. The brisket was moist and juicy and the bbq sauce was awesome! I would work on a different cornbread since it was different. Still good but tasted like sweet cake. Just my opinion :)"}
{"text":"This spot is well worth driving to Boulder City over and over again! Always great services! You don't need teeth for the ribs or brisket!"}
{"text":"The wife and I ordered the brisket sandwich meals. Both were awesome meals and delicious. We picked the Mac & Cheese and coke slaw as our sides. Again, both completely satisfied! The brisket had a great smoke flavor and was extremely moist. The BBQ sauce was different but was not the primarily used for the flavor. My point is the smoked meat stood on its own which is the most important BBQ factor in my opinion. The service was about reproach! We were thoughtfully looked after by the staff. One of the owners even stopped by to ensure we were happy. They now have table service and are currently expanding to 40 more tables. The price was a little above average for this type of joint but the flavor speaks for itself. Put it this way they use only black Angus beef!!"}
{"text":"We found this place after spending the morning at Hoover Dam. Great hole in the wall place. Absolutely amazing food. I had the brisket sliders and a side of Mac n cheese. Some of the best Mac n cheese I've ever had. Would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is the real deal! We were hiking nearby at Lake Mead but this place is worth the drive from Vegas by itself.

 If I had the rental car for another day I'd have been back again. Food was amazing and the service was really friendly in the laid back, local style that all great BBQ places feature. Brisket was very tender, no knife needed here. The beans were a winner with a chili type of flavor and the okra was spot on. The sweet tea was perfect and the cornbread was about the best I've had anywhere. It almost tasted like cake since it was so smooth and sweet, no grittiness here.

The parking lot is pretty small so I just parked down the street and my car didn't get towed so I guess it's fine, hopefully. It's in an industrial type area so yes you're going the right way if you seem lost. The Vegs area has a few good BBQ places (and many mediocre ones I'm sure) and this is among the very best."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ!  With the food and service, it makes it for an excellent place for good BBQ!  Bets in Las Vegas!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is going on the list of places we will drive to just to eat - from PHOENIX! Loved the place. Love the owner. Loved the food. GO. HERE. Everything was delicious. The servers were delightful. The neighborhood visitors and people watching was great. Why is this place in a crappy little strip mall in Boulder City Nevada? Because it's that good, it can be successful anywhere. Ate the food. Got the tee shirt (literally.) Hubs ate the pulled pork and loved it. I got the brisket sliders. Great. Bought some sauce to take with but shhhhhhhh.....not supposed to sell it.  Help Dan out and bring your own leak-proof container and take some sauce with you. The BEST."}
{"text":"I hesitate to give a good review because I don't want people to know how great this place is so I can keep this Gem to myself but this place is a Gem in boulder city. Great BBQ good price and portions and food was outstanding and I've had allot of BBQ. YELPERS check in and get a free desert with your order. They were fast and friendly as can be. Only four stars because I never give 5 on only one visit but so far so good"}
{"text":"Food was really good I got the two meat combo with chicken, beef brisket and coleslaw. The food was all delicious and the service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Best home cook BBQ in the state!! If you're out of state visiting, or local, and like good home cook style BBQ, don't waste your time going anywhere else. Come to Fox Smokehouse BBQ! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great service and great food.  We all shared and tried brisket, chicken, bratwurst and ribs.  The ribs were a favorite but they were all fantastic."}
{"text":"My other half and I were on the way to Supai from our stop at the Hoover Dam. I actually interested in some good BBQ and found this joint on Yelp. 

Fox certainly lived up to its good reviews! It was pretty quiet when we got it but it was also like 3:30pm in the afternoon (we're not sure if we were eating lunch or dinner either). Parking was easy on this fairly quiet street. 

We ordered a two meat combo - brisket and ribs with double mac and cheese sides - along with a set of wings. OH MY GOSH THOSE RIBS. They fell right off the room and was flavored so well. Get a full racks if you can!!! The brisket is also award winning but I, once again, forgot I'm not the biggest fan of brisket. Still so good but my mouth was watering over the ribs...AND the most delicious mac and cheese I've had in so long!! Something about how they make it is very different. The wings we also delish but I couldn't stop thinking of the ribs. 

So....get the ribs."}
{"text":"The beans are a standout. BBQ sure tastes good after our Bluffs Trail hike. We especially liked the wings with sweet potato fries on the new menu. I also had the brisket with mild sauce. The smoked chicken thighs were okay. Thighs aren't my fav part."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had since Texas. I've only posted restaurants that deserve a 5 out of 5 and this is one of them"}
{"text":"Wow!! This place did not dissapoint at all. Dad and his wife were visiting from out of the country. Took them to Hoover dam, after long walks and an hour tour, and of course many pics, we had all worked up quite an appetite. Found place on yelp and decided to take them there since they had not tried smoked bbq since they arrived to the US. I ordered them the 3 meat combo with one extra side. Ribs, brisket and sausage as well as coleslaw, beans and the mac and cheese. The ribs were perfect, so tender and juicy. The brisket was also cooked to perfection and the sausage was extremely tasty. Them beans!!!! Omg, finally beans with some flavor and spice!! We also ordered a salad and chicken sandwhich oh and a side of the best sweet potatoe fries  ever! This is a little gem kinda hidden away, but its worth the drive to Boulder City if you ask me. We could never go back to the memphis or the famous daves after trying this bbq!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place was awesome! Do yourself a favor and find this place if you love BBQ. I had the brisket and ribs combo which came with a side of mac and cheese and a dinner roll. The brisket was melt in your mouth good, so moist and yummy. Best I've had. The ribs were also delicious. They come with no sauce (which is how I like them) but there is some on the table. They also were melt in your mouth delicious. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ!  Had the sliders and sweet potato fries; Jim had the brisket, Mac and cheese and baked beans.  Food was excellent and service from Monique was fast and friendly.
My fav here was the fries but I love that they toasted the buns and the brisket had great flavor.
Glad they were open on Sunday.  Came here after a morning at the Hoover Dam."}
{"text":"Another kick butt meal. Terrific lunch with delicious ribs and brisket. You cannot beat this spot if your nearby. Get your rear down here."}
{"text":"ALWAYS AMAZING food with AMAZING customer service. Have tried a different meat every time we come and have yet to be disappointed. Husband got the tacos with pork and was so impressed we're going back tonight! Worth the drive every time!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service and awesome BBQ! Would definitely drive back just for the food. We had ribs, brisket, Mac n cheese and cowboy fries. Everything was great. The place smelled like BBQ heaven and everyone was so nice, even the other guests. Reminded me of the show cheers, where everyone knows your name.  That kind of feel. Even my two little critics liked it, and they are both less than two so they do not like much!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from Minnesota and found this place via Yelp. We pulled up and the owner Dan opened the door for us and greeted us. You know it's a good place when all the people in the place are telling you what to order. We had a full rack of ribs, pulled pork, beef brisket, the beans, Mac and cheese and coleslaw. Everything was unbelievable and can't pick a favorite. You can tell everything is homemade and even their sauces. They don't sauce anything so you can do it yourself. Awesome!!  Guy from Triple D needs to come here!!!  Thanks Dan and team for an amazing dinner, we will be back next time we visit."}
{"text":"Yum...Go here...you won't regret it!!!!!  Loved the cornbread, barbecue, Mac n cheese, and ranch dressing."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  Hubby and I drove out last Friday afternoon and am so glad we did.  Great Service-Thumbs up to Lisa (hope I got her name right).  So warm and bubbly - made us feel like regulars.  Advised us to get the Smoke Brats and Brother was she right!  It was the best ever....still craving it right now.  My husband is a butcher and at home BBQ/Smoker King.  After hearing this Lisa invited him to speak with the Kitchen Manager, and observe some of their smoking techniques.  All the food was great (especially loved the brisket, the cowboy beans and Cowboy Cheese Fries are the bomb too!).   Ya'll have to try this place out!  we will definitely be going back. 
Tip: this little place is located in an older strip of stores 1 block behind the Vons Shopping Complex."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on the way back from cycling all afternoon at the Lake.  

Was told that the best taste they offer is the Ribs or Brisket and Macaroni or Beans.

I had the Brisket and Macaroni and Bean and the roll and spicy sauce.  Great filling meal.

Kept me full all the way home on the drive to Los Angeles. 

I don't usually eat such a high saturated fat meal, but I would definitely return here to do it again next time in the area.  It's worth taking the cholesterol for such good quality.

Parking is easy on the street in front.

Very Casual place--don't dress up.

Lots of TVs--I was able to watch the World Series during dinner.

You can feel comfortable dining here alone or with others."}
{"text":"************    UPDATED !  ************

The service was so much better on my latest visit. All it took was a little time for the Fox's to fix this small hiccup as they moved to to table service.  

The food was so damn good and the brisket sandwich is just nirvana.   I cannot speak highly enough of how good the food is here.  These folks have something special here and I am glad I found it!
****************************************

My new favorite bbq place in Vegas.  The tri-tip sandwich was sublime.   It is served on Texas Toast that is so delicious.  Crispy, buttery, golden exterior with a soft center.  The meat was melt in your mouth tender with a great smoky flavor.  The spicy bbq sauce was a perfect accent. 

It came with a huge pile of crispy hot French Fries that I could not stop eating.  If I have any criticism it is the waitstaff.  They were all pleasant and hard working but they still don't have the table service concept down yet.   It seems this was more of a lunch counter place and the restaurant concept is sort of new to them.  Again, the servers were great, they just need some guidance and training.  

That small criticism pales in comparison to how good the food is here.  I will be back even though it is 29 miles from my home.  DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Third time in here and the service is just awesome!!! They treat ya like family!!! Food and service can't be beat!!!"}
{"text":"--- Review from www.JerseyGirlinVegas.com ---

Just a short drive from Henderson is Boulder City, the gateway to the Hoover Dam. There really is not much to Boulder, there's Lake Mead, minimal shopping and a small residential area. 

On the 4th of July I was invited to a party catered by Fox's BBQ. This was unlike any BBQ I have ever had before. But then again, I'm from Jersey so maybe I just don't know what good BBQ is all about. On the menu was a big bowl of caesar salad, homemade macaroni and cheese, pulled chicken, tri tip and corn bread. Everything was made from scratch and the meats we all slow cooked to perfection. 

Since there were not a whole lot of options, I got a little bit of everything and let me tell you, it was all fantastic! I gobbled it all up, the mac and cheese was to die for. My favorite though was the slow cooked tri-tip, oh my god, sooo good! I am looking forward to getting over to their store to have another meal! Certainly two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My family was looking for smokehouse place after spending hrs at Hoover dam.  We came across Fox's in Yelp.  The reviews were dead on everything we ordered was great.  Toward the end of our meal we met Dan (I believe) the owner of the establishment.  Dan asked us how everything was going.  He was friendly and we had nice time talking  with him about the dam, his business.  Nice man and I think anytime an owner is there to greet customers shows their commitment to providing customer satisfaction.  Good meeting you Dan.  Thank you for your hospitality and great food."}
{"text":"Ordered and was very pleased with this Restaurants food. Staff is friendly and attentive. Locals seem to love this place. Will stop again when in the area."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend went in today and service was really great employees were very nice and polite the owner also came out and asked us if we like our food and if we were enjoying it if we needed anything else just ask very friendly and polite atmosphere and would most definitely recommend people going to this restaurant greatest experience of my day"}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ I've ever had, I'm very spice sensitive and some of the side dishes ( potato salad, beans and unexpectedly but still delicious, cole slaw), were too spicy for me but their original BBQ sauce could be served hot with a spoon! The brisket needed nothing and the ribs were perfectly charred outside and melty moist inside. I'm also gluten free, so watching the reaction to the wonderful sweet cake like cornbread on my husbands face made me jealous."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way to Las Vegas to visit friends. Thanks, Yelp, for another great recommendation! Ribs literally falling off the bone. Tender, moist brisket. Legit cowboy means with nice spice and big chunks of pork. Fun service staff who like to joke around with customers and work together to assure you're needs are always met. We liked it so much that we had to come back two days later and bring our friends. And they liked it so much that they're already making plans to bring some of their other friends!"}
{"text":"After a day volunteering at an event at Lake Mead, we wanted to pick up some good food in Boulder City. Yelp lead us to Fox Smokehouse BBQ, which is easy to find, and looked promising as we walked in.

Originally, I was going to go for a shredded something sandwich, then saw the newly added Tri Tip Sandwich. I am a sucker for tri tip and had to give that one a try. It came with fries, which were the huge, crinkle cut, seasoned sticks of potato. 

The fries were delicious and so fresh my patience was tested waiting for them to cool down enough to eat without scalding my mouth.

When tackling the Tri Tip Sandwich, the aroma of delicious BBQ made my mouth water. My first bite was not entirely disappointing. I added a little more sauce to really get that BBQ experience. Growing up in Southern California, I have had a wide range of Tri Tip sandwiches. This one ranked up with some of the better ones. However, the meat may have been a little on the dry side.

Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, the prices were a little higher than I prefer to pay for lunch, for what you get though, worth it.

Also, the staff is very nice and polite. Even when a rather unkempt homeless gentleman came in, asking about the menu, they treated him with respect and kindness. He ended up ordering some food, and went on his way."}
{"text":"After one of my friends kept telling me that Fox Smokehouse was a MUST for good BBQ when in Boulder City, I finally went. I was not disappointed. 

After taking friends to the Hoover Dam, we stopped by here for a late lunch. It was mid-afternoon, so the place was slow though there were 4 or 5 other tables. We sat down and the server came over to take our drink order. After we got our drinks, we placed our orders and a few minutes later our food came out. 

Now, let me preface this by saying I have yet to have good BBQ in Las Vegas. But this stuff was delicious. I got the brisket plate, which came with a side and a dinner roll. I got Mac & cheese. The brisket was so tender and tasty. At first I was worried that with plastic fork & knife, I wouldn't be able to cut my meal if needed... but even with plastic utensils, the meat was easily sliced through. It was flavorful and tender. The Mac & cheese was creamy with really good flavor. My boyfriend got a sandwich, and the Texas toast it was served on was delicious! 

It doesn't look like much, but between the delicious food and great service, I can't recommend Fox Smokehouse enough. They have awards hanging on the wall and those awards are well deserved. This place is so good!! Reasonable prices, huge portions, great service. Yup. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Fox Smokehouse Bbq is tucked away on a side street, but they possibly have the best food in Boulder City. The service and the quality of their products is consistently excellent. Try the brisket and the cowboy beans. The seating area is a tad small, I suggest you get some to go and have a picnic overlooking Lake Mead. They serve a variety of beer in bottles."}
{"text":"We were visiting the Hoover dam and decided to go to lunch in Boulder City. Wr found this cute wonderful place on yelp and decided to go. We came somewhat late, so there were a couple of locals, and the place was empty. If you don't know where it is or that it exists, you won't find it.
The service is home/family like, and the food is soooo good. BBQ like it's supposed to be (and the price is great, of course)
Also - you get a free dessert if you check in on yelp! (we had the pumpkin cheese cake - oh boy!)"}
{"text":"FOXES BBQ Smokehouse in Boulder City, Nv.  A gotta go to place for the most excellent BBQ.  The ribs are so flavorful and tender and are perfectly complimented by the sauce which has the the well balanced flavors of sweet and spicy.  I picked the bones clean.  Well worth the trip.  If you are passing through Boulder City on the way to or from the Boulder Dam or just exploring around the Vegas area, you will be pleased that you stopped at FOXES"}
{"text":"I LOVE their brisket and their BBQ chicken.  I've been there several times and consider them the best BBQ place around."}
{"text":"*Military discount* 

Visited on Sunday 7-3-16...we barged right on in at 10:30 (they open at 11) but they were nice enough to seat us anyways LOL sorry!!!  I just couldn't help it after I got a whiff of that smoker out front.  I had to get me summa that BBQ!!! 

$33 got us a combo #4, a brisket sandwich, and two soft drinks.  The waitress brought out a tiny little cup of water with an itty bitty straw for my boy and a coloring sheet and crayons. I thought that was really nice!  The whole place was realllllly clean as well which I liked. 

My combo #4 was $18 and consisted of two meats and two sides.  I chose pulled pork and chicken with fries and coleslaw.  The meal came with two dinner rolls and butter as well.  The portions were large and the meats were perfect....so juicy and tender!  The fries were hot and crispy.  This was possibly the best barbecue I've ever had.  I'd be happy to eat this every day.  

I was able to snag a bite of my husband's $11 brisket sandwich and it was amazing.  The brisket was fall-apart tender and so moist.  It was topped with coleslaw on Texas toast that was crisped to perfection.  He chose sweet potato fries as his side and they were fresh, hot, and crispy.  

If you ever find yourself in Boulder City  you gotta try this place.  This Tennessee girl knows her barbecue and this sh*t is the real deal."}
{"text":"Really, such a great surprise in a little town. 

It's July 4th weekend and we felt the urge to get out of Vegas (where we live), so we took a short trip to Boulder. That's when we heard about Fox and we thought, what better to eat than BBQ on this American holiday. Perfect. 

And indeed it was. 

Set up like a mom and pop shop, Fox looks like it takes up three units of a sidewalk strip. Once inside, it's got the feel of a fast-food/take-out place (which it also is), but the people and the layout give a humbling environment to make dining-in comfortable as well. 

There's lots to look at while waiting for your grub: sports memorabilia, live TV, and even children's art work (or at least I'd presume they're of children's) - and this was just one room. One of the supposed three units is dedicated to seating, complete with booths and more flair. No matter where you're seated, the servers are very helpful and super friendly. 

We ordered a pitcher of PBR ($3!), half pound of ribs meal with fries and dinner roll, half pound of brisket meal with cowboy beans and a din din roll. Damn, did this stuff hit the spot. It reminded me of eating Franklin's in Austin but with their own spin on it. 

After this visit, I'd say this place is now definitely on my radar and locked in for a visit whenever I'm back in Boulder."}
{"text":"Best BBQ is Southern NV. The Brisket sandwich is ridiculous. I've tried it with peppers and onions, which is better on the philly, but with just pickles and BBq sauce on the perfectly toasted Texas toast which is crispy on the outside while soft on the inside filled with the most delicious tender Brisket that will put you in BBq heaven. I highly recommend this place. Service is warm and friendly and makes you feel welcome from the moment you enter. Be sure to say \"HI\" to Mel who has got to be the nicest person in Boulder City!!!"}
{"text":"This place alone was worth the drive. How many family owned amazing little restaurants are out there? Not too many. This one is fantastic!! Great friendly service, very very clean (including the bathrooms!!), the ribs are huuuuuuge and full of meat. Nicely done. You can tell this is a family owned business that cares about quality and customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped here before Vegas!
This place is right on. Highly recommend it to anyone in the area or near the area. Mac and cheese was yummy, pulled pork excellent, ribs falling off and the corn bread was so good and a little bit sweet which was different but I loved it.
The server was so kind and I think the owner was there and he was kind as well. There was a worker there working for him and before the guy left he made sure to thank him and offer him some food to go. Good business sense and just kindness you don't see anymore."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  5 STARS for customer service!  Lisa is such a sweetheart!  From the moment we arrived till she said goodbye as we left, this woman never stopped working.  Lisa made us feel as if we stopped by to see our friends.  We told her it was our first time coming in, so she explained the menu choices and gave us some recommendations. 

We both ordered Combo #4, the 2 meat 2 side choice.  My picks were 3 Ribs, sliced brisket, mac & cheese and sweet potato fries.  My guy ordered 3 ribs, pulled pork, potato salad and coleslaw.  Everything was very good. Yep! I did it again!  I got to try a BUNCH of stuff.  And LOVED every minute of it!  As other Yelps have posted the mac & cheese was truly a stand out side dish.  What makes their mac & cheese different? They put pureed green peppers (probably something like Anaheim or Hatch) into the cheese sauce.  The aroma hits you right away, yet the flavor is delicate and not at all overwhelming.  I desperately want them to tell me the recipe. But, I'm afraid if they did, I would quickly become as big as a house.             

After ALL of that great food, we were rewarded with a free dessert for a Yelp check-in.  We choose the slice of chocolate cake.  But Lisa told us we could have whatever we wanted from their dessert selection, which included several types of cheese cake as well.   

From what I understand, Fox BBQ is planning an expansion. More tables and hiring servers, this local business is growing.  My best recommendation for success during this type of transition is to make sure Lisa does the training.        

Pictures truly are worth a 1000 words. I LOVE pictures of food and posted some below.  But honesty, in this case the food tasted even better than it looks.  I am in no way a BBQ aficionado, but I am a eater! And someone willing to give credit where credit is due.  We will be returning to Fox in the future and I suggest you make your way out to Boulder City and enjoy their great meats and sides yourself."}
{"text":"By far the best mac-n-cheese I have ever had!!!! The bbq sliders were also great!!! I had a bite of my boyfriends brisket and it was amazing also! Our waitress was also amazing! We will for sure go back there!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and the people are really nice. Our food was out in minutes and fresh and hot. 
Be prepared for the price though. It was about 30 for two of us. However the portion was great compared to other BBQ places I have eaten at. It was well worth it."}
{"text":"Came in on my way to Vegas from the Hoover Dam. When I walked the aroma was wonderful. The service was quick and very friendly. Ordered a combo #4 with ribs and brisket. The ribs are some of the best I've ever had and the brisket was very flavorful. All in all it is very good BBQ and I would recommend it to anyone going through Boulder City."}
{"text":"I had to do some business in Boulder City, and even though I had just eaten, I really wanted to stop in here and check out this place. As I walked in the door, the sweet aroma of smoking meats gave me a bit of a chubby. Oh how I love good BBQ. The staff was very helpful and gave me some great insight on the restaurant and owners. Their ribs have won some competitions.

The restaurant itself is fairly big, with probably 20 or more tables so plenty of room to sit and enjoy. They have several beers available, along with sodas and ice tea, sweet tea, and more.

I got the two meat combo with brisket and ribs. A side of BBQ beans. I took this to go so I could enjoy for dinner that night.

The brisket was tasty, albeit a little dry. Not much smoke ring to it, the flavors didn't jump out and wow me. The ribs were a bit heavy on the rub, fell off the bone, and also lacked any kind of wow factor. The baked beans I sampled and didn't finish because they were more on the peppery side than I like. A small store bought dinner roll finished off the meal. Their BBQ was actually pretty good, had a nice sweet and smoky combo.

I'll try them again, they are the best BBQ in Boulder City. I think the hype outweighed the product though. Worth another try next time I'm in Boulder City."}
{"text":"BBQ is great, but don't overlook the sides. Delicious. Not a lot of good BBQ in Las Vegas, but this is one of them."}
{"text":"What a gem!! Outstanding service and mouthwatering food. As a former owner of a Southern food and BBq truck, this place gets a blue ribbon from me. They have smokers out front, the meat is flavorful and juicy and the sauces are amazing. The mac n cheese has a zestiness to it that I think comes from pepperjack in the blend and is spot on. So glad I come to boulder so much..."}
{"text":"No too bad- drove out here from Henderson to try it because it has such good ratings- not worth the drive. First- there's no vegetables on the menu no green beans/collars greens/turnip greens. That was disappointing. The brisket was the best reviewed item but I didn't like it at all. The pulled Kirk was good and I would order it again- but the tea wasn't great and neither was the potato salad"}
{"text":"We ordered the cowboy fries and shared a #4 combo with brisket, ribs, mac and cheese, and coleslaw. My son ordered a burger with bacon and brisket. Everything was excellent! The brisket was tender. The ribs were fall off the bone. The mac was top tier. And our waitress was super sweet and helpful. My husband is from TX, and is the biggest bbq critic. In all of LV, only Rolling Smoke was worth going to, but now we will probably be making a trip or two to Fox Smokehouse."}
{"text":"Well deserving of 5 stars. My wife and I stopped in for lunch after an outing to Boulder City. We both had the chicken sandwich which had a nice smoky flavor and was wonderful. We were so full from lunch that we skipped dinner. The owner came around to each table to make sure all patrons were satisfied. Nice touch!"}
{"text":"Based on Yelp reviews, I bookmarked this place on our to do list...and so glad I did!  This place is AMAZING.  First let's start off with the menu.  It's easy to navigate and provides a wonderful selection of main and side dishes that will allow you to mix and match for just the right combination. 

We went with their best-selling brisket and ribs combo. Both were absolutely splendid! Wood smoked, flavourful, tender and moist. Staff was exceptionally friendly and made great recommendations. This is a wallet conscious place for BBQ as it is so labour intensive.

Located in an industrial park just off a main road with curbside parking outside of Hoover Dam in Boulder City.  

The reason for the five stars is the outstanding customer service.  We got there around 10:45 am and found out they opened at 11 am.  After driving a few hours mate needed to use the loo so asked one of the employees working outside if we could go in, do the deed, and wait outside until they open.  The employee let us in and when done said we could just order as they decided to open up 15 minutes early.  Now have you EVER hear of that happening in L.A... I think not! 

Excellent find...this is not a place to pass up! Would definitely come back whenever in town.

After a long day at the hoover damn anything sounds good, whats even better BBQ one of my favorite foods and my GF whos from Tennessee. First the atmosphere is nothing special small, places off a side street there was construction going on so it took forever to find the place. Now ive had texas BBQ, ive had memphis BBQ and ive had LA BBQ and let me tell you this place knows how to BBQ. Got the tri tip and the ribs, to me the tri tips were kinda dry they needed alot of sauce but after that they were ok so off to a bad start than i took a bite of that corn bread and BAM back in business. Now the ribs HOLY MOLY! Heaven in my mouth, the ribs were so good fall off the bone before i could even bite into it, so flavorful. The side of mac and cheese oh man i love that all their BBQ is slightly spicy even the mac and cheese so im a happy kid. The service here isnt bad, place was dead so i had a good experience. At the end the check was OK, not too expensive overall whenever im in the area of craving BBQ ill do the 45min drive up to boulder city from vegas just for this place, IM A FAN!

{"text":"Great food and service! Ribs did fall off the bone as other comments say. The brisket was one of the best I ever had. $1 upcharge on ribs and brisket. 
Ribs were somewhat old though, some parts were crusty."}

{"text":"We traveled through Boulder City on our way to the Hoover Dam, and I came to the conclusion that there isn't much to eat in this small town, besides fast food. So, when we came upon Fox Smokehouse, there was no way we were passing it up. 

Our group of three all ordered the same thing: The Tri-Tip sandwich, with a side of potato salad. The meat was crazy tender and tasty, and I'm a very big fan of the generous amounts they give us. The potato salad was OK, but it wasn't something to write home about. There were a few bottles of various hot sauces on the table, because you can't have good BBQ until you have an assortment of sauces to drown it in. 

The day was really hot, so naturally there were a number of flies buzzing around our heads as we ate. Our waitress did apologize repeatedly for the problem. 

This wouldn't be my first pick for dining out at; however, it is many, many miles above fast food."}
{"text":"Worth the 5 stars. Take the drive. 
Burnt ends was the run away winner at the table. They were marinaded, seasoned and so tender, no BBQ sauce needed. Pull pork was more mild in flavor but captured the true smoky flavor which complimented the sauce nicely. 
Ribs no for required! BBQ sauce on the tables. Menu includes something for everyone including BOOZE; mixed frozen drinks, beer, and wine. I was able to make my meal low carb/paleo- with a salad as side and no sauce!!! Corn bread was good and moist, but it was served cold, would have been better warm.

Staff was fast and friendly- plus on the spot with refills.  Decor nice with atmosphere so pleasing we lost track of the time. Staff never once rushed us out the door. Several groups of people were still there enjoying some good conversation long after the meal ended. This is was a restaurant should be!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place out since we were looking for a caterer . You will not be disappointed. Get the cowboy fries and the cobbler . All the meats were amazing . We ended up using them for my husbands birthday party and they delivered to our house . Everyone loved the food especially the brisket ! We've tried a few BBQ places in Henderson and Vegas ,the drive to Boulder City is worth it !"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've ever had! If your on your way to the Hoover Dam or coming back from it you need to stock here and get some food. My sister even loved it and she's one picky eater. Everyone is super friendly!"}
{"text":"Found this little BBQ gem here on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Much to our delight, the food was amazing! The portions were great. Our server, Amanda, was fantastic! Very attentive! A 5 Stars dining experience. Will definitely recommend this place to any one want some amazing BBQ and Great service. Definitely coming back the next time we're in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I had pulled pork and cowboy beans. Pork was tender and perfect with both the spicy and mild sauces. I probably should have tried the ribs which they win prizes for. I will next time. I have never had cowboy beans but I am going to need to learn how to make them. They had celery and onions and bits of meat. Seemed to be two kinds of beans. Savory but not too salty as beans often are."}
{"text":"Another great find.  Very cute off-the-beaten path eatery. Nice selection of sandwiches and meat eaters specials.  My boyfriend and daughter say the potato salad is fantastic.  I love the brisket.  Friendly staff and fast service.  Definitely recommended.  Make sure you get there before they close, which I think is 7 or 7:30pm."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp so we gave it a try. I had the brisket with sweet potatoe fries and coleslaw. (A-MA-ZING!!!!) my husband has the ribs and sausages with Mac & Cheese- Also delicious!!! I wanted to try the Bahama Mama with Rum- and that was a mistake because I was super disappointed. It came out with this anemic colour, separating. Also it tasted sour like when milk turns bad. (Charged me $7 for the drink and it wasn't consumable.) Still I give it 5 stars because the staff is friendly, shop is clean and the BBQ is beyond this world good!"}
