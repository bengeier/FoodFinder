{"text":"Horrible customer service. The staff always have attitude and are not helpful at all especially the manager. I ordered the low fat mango smoothie. Although the store promotes a healthy attitude towards food and appears to use the freshest ingredients this place is far from healthy. The person making my smoothie jus poured in some sugar filled mixture into the blender and added sugar filled frozen yogurt. This drink was full of preservatives and sugar. Definitely not worth the calories or the price. And I could do without the attitude."}
{"text":"Pros: Chocolate Chip Cookie, food delivery station
Cons: Asian Sesame Chicken Salad

Is it a good restaurant for kids? Yes
Is it good choice for big groups? Yes
Is the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? Maybe

On Wednesday around 12pm, I went to the restaurant to get my food to go and have my lunch on another place. The place was crowded, but I noticed some free seats there. The cashier line was not so big and I did not take so much time to place my order.

After paid, I direct myself to the food delivery station and noticed something that I never noticed on the other restaurants on the USA side. They have a monitor that counts how much time each food is taking to be ready to go and the order changes color when it takes so much time. Nice thing. It incentives the staff to have always a better performance.

Overall, the chocolate chip cookie was delicious like always, but I did not like so much the salad. Different than on USA, I found big chunks of lettuces instead of in small pieces like the other restaurants. This is a negative point to me, because I expect always a good preparation for this food due to the complexity of it. But I am willing to give a new chance to the place."}
{"text":"Choose 2 is the perfect portion size for me! And I get to try out different things on the menu. While quite pricey, and can be replicated at home at a fraction of the cost, its a nice place to spend a few hours with friends catching up, or studying. 

You are pretty safe ordering most of the items on the menus, except for the mushroom soup. I was under the impression that it was a cream of mushroom soup, but it was far from what I had expected. It was more sour and strange, so I couldn't finish it. Before I ordered, I did ask to confirm that it was cream of mushroom soup, but upon tasting, I think that it had more of a wine base than cream base. Maybe my taste buds are not refined enough, and the soup is actually good? I'm not sure."}
{"text":"This place is really one of the few I would splurge on for a lunch this summer! The service was very fast and friendly and I felt welcomed when coming here alone for lunch. I ordered the Citrus Asian Salad and paired it with the Italian Sandwich and it cured my coffee shakes! I also ordered a lemonade and a freshly baked cookie, and I honestly never splurge like this on a lonely lunch. Great ambiance whether you want to sit outside or inside :)"}
{"text":"Actually the worst Panera I've ever been to. Went the first time. Told myself to never go back. Was craving a warm sandwich and I always go to the Subway a few doors down, so I thought I'd give Panera one more shot. Bad idea. Paid $10 for a sandwich, waited 15+ minutes for that sandwich (where they make you line up in a hallway - people sneezing right where the food is) The guy behind me was cussing bc he had to wait so long. When I finally got my food, found a cold sandwich that might as well been slapped together, wrapped in paper that looked like someone was crinkling paper to throw in the trash. To top it all off the sandwich STINKS - like smells terrible. Going right in the garbage. I'll never be back."}
{"text":"I don't understand how a human being with 2 ears that work perfectly fine cannot get an order correct. I place an order with \"Alaina or Alana\" it's completely wrong and I was given no receipt! So I call and speak to Jamie the store supervisor/manager who has the absolute worst guest resolution skills EVER!! I call and tell the manager Jamie my order is wrong and would like it refunded, she thinks that I was lying and asked me to drive back up to Panera bread with the entire order as I was given no receipt to PROVE that I was even there!! She never offered to replace my meal not one time!! I eat at Panera breads all over the country and this location and staff are beyond the worst ever in life!! Poor customer service skills like this example given is why people in the food and beverage industry have the stigma of being stupid people!! All she had to do was replace my pick 2, offer a smoothie or dessert on the house and all would have ended well, but no, I drove to Panera twice that day and I will not be driving back to a Panera anytime because of Jamie and Alaina!! These girls need to be working in the dish room, NOT WITH CUSTOMERS!!!"}
{"text":"good for what it is - soup, salad, sandwhich.

i like the breakfast power sandwhich - it's basically an expensive egg mcmuffin with ham. i think i'm gonna just go to mcdonald's next time.

their pastries are nearly always really dry"}
{"text":"Stop by for a quick dinner last night even though I have not heard good things about Panera, we thought we would give it a try. My husband and I got and steak and cheese panini, kids got a ham and cheese and the husband also got a soup. The kids sandwhichs were just ok (how can you go wrong with plain ham) which helped them get the one star, and I will say also that the employees were very friendly. However, my husband and I sandwhichs were inedible. The meat was so tuff you could not bite through it, I ended up just throwing mine away.
I have heard that all Paradise Bakery's will eventually switch over to Panera which makes me very sad because it is definitely not the same!!"}
{"text":"I've used them quite often for breakfast catering at work.  It's always a disappointment.  I've had empty coffee containers delivered, they're always late, they've lost orders (today's order specifically).  I have a meeting starting shortly and I won't have anything ready when our guests arrive.  This is the last order I'll be placing from Panera.  UPDATE:  Order just arrived and was wrong; only got half of what I ordered."}
{"text":"Good food, fast service, sort of noisy environment! Great experience overall"}
{"text":"Decent light classic lunches. Portion is at times smaller than what you'd expect for that price. Overall a good place for a fast and convenient brunch"}
{"text":"This place ultimately my favorite spot to chill in after a 10 mi trail hike @angel park, just in time for my brunch, i love the freshness of the food, cozy and laibback atmosphere, and of course the Free WiFi! ;) i commend the staffs, who not only very accommodating but knowledgeable on the menu as well. A must-go place, should try it out!;)"}
{"text":"Miserable experience.  The cashier who took my order was a unfortunate combination of rudeness and incompetence.  After acting offended after explaining that I intended to eat in rather than take out, she served a STONE COLD souffle and refused to heat it up.  She didn't even suggest using the microwave (which, admittedly, I was familiar with them being avialable for customer use) and opted to lie about how their souffles were always served hot.

Bottom line:  if you've worked a hard week and want to have a relaxing Saturday breakfast, please stay away from this place -- you will at best enjoy sub-par food and likely leave frustrated at their obnoxious level of customer service."}
{"text":"Bad, the staff does not know the difference between a tomato and a cucumber , that is sad because 3 times I received the wrong thing. And they have this big book of mistakes, managers do not apologize just tell you to tell them you are in this book."}
{"text":"Don't ask Carol to help with anything but complain to you in front of your face. Awful customer service."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwiches are always sloppy and poorly made. I stopped going for quite a while hoping they would improve, but sadly they have not. And they have slow service."}
{"text":"Wow, for a $6 half sandwich you don't get much.  Two very thin avocado slices and minimal shredded chicken.  I got the 2 for deal, not much of a deal.  The potato soup was lacking in flavor.  I won't be back to this place."}
{"text":"Omg.  So.  Bad.   It took 20 mins to order and that wasn't standing in line. That was the actual ordering time because the new employee kept messing it up.   I felt bad for her because every time she'd call someone over for help, they would help for 2 seconds then walk away.   Then they brought out maybe half the things we ordered.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service from the manager... the food is standard Panera Bread quality and not worth a trip back to this location. I walked in on 12/28, Sunday morning, Melissa the cashier was friendly and efficient. Then the manager, who was unorganized, running around (it wasn't busy) and creating a chaotic atmosphere appeared. Her name was Jessica, as I asked the cashier before I left. She didn't smile or offer a greeting to customers, instead she was rudely speaking to the team (complaining about a new person not understanding how to make a drink and being overwhelmed herself). The cashier and another team member were making 2 smoothies which had been ordered, 1 of them was mine. All was good then Jessica haphazardly delegated other tasks to the team members. My smoothie was finished mixing but needed to be poured into a cup. I asked if she could pour mine before moving on to the next one so my order could be completed. She said, \"sir I know you want me to be 15 people but I'm only one person!\". I responded, \"focus on finishing 1 task before moving on to another.\" In addition, the team serving the sandwiches is average at best. Engage your team and delight your customers to ensure repeat business and you'll also be able to take down the \"now hiring\" sign. This Panera is lacking in both areas and I will not be returning, it's simply not worth it in terms of value."}
{"text":"Great service clean fast and Zachary even cleaned up my spilled mess and replaced with new drink. Ordered to take home after meal. In and out quickly. Perfection."}
{"text":"The only thing this place has going for it is that it's cheap.  Service is usually show towards me because I'm a metal head in a restaurant that usually caters to business people and \"Becky with the good hair\" types.  It's a good place for a cheap eat so I'd appreciate it if the staff stepped up their game a little bit."}
{"text":"Service is really slow and terrible at this.location.  I ordered the tomatoe and mozzarella flatbread.  When the order finally arrived, the bread was soggy and cheese barely visible.  WHERE'S THE CHEESE???? Worst ever flatbread for $7.99.  Shame on Panera for serving this huge disappointment and rip off.  My rating of 1 star is for the abundance of parking at this location."}
{"text":"Not going to let one person ruin my Panera experience. The service of this place was not up to Panera standards. The person who was bringing food to the table clearly seemed unconvinced when I asked for a missing item --- just changed my mind and I am giving this place 2 stars. The location, not the brand. The restrooms were absolutely filthy! You think they would do a better job keeping the restrooms clean, but no. It was very challenging to take my son to the restroom. I hope this place gets back on track with the brand. Shameful."}
{"text":"I have been here several times over the last couple of weeks and it is has quickly become my new favourite place to eat breakfast/lunch.  Between my husband and I we have tried several different items on the menu and all of them have been fantastic.  The cashier gave me a rewards card on my first visit and when I signed up online later that day I received a free drink (coffee, tea or soda) everyday for a month. I will say they are a tad expensive but no more so than Starbucks and the quality is far better and everything tastes fresh."}
{"text":"I've been going to Panera for their salads pretty much since they opened and I've been to Panera's all over the country, however I had a unique experience last night which was the first time I've ever been to this Panera.  I ordered the Southwest Chile Lime Ranch Salad with Chicken except when I got it home I discovered it had no chicken.  There was romaine lettuce- lots of romaine, no arugula, no corn blend, no quinoa.  There was some tomato.  Not certain the cilantro was in there but there was quite a bit of feta-and no avocado.  It tasted good, but 3 ingredients-really?  At Panera?  Is this some kind of a joke?  I'm going to give them one more chance and eat the salad there rather than take out and if basically the majority of the salad is missing I'd like to know why and will ask for my money to be returned.  I would have given it 1 star but I liked the dressing and I was really hungry.   Buyer beware."}
{"text":"Mediocre taste for most items, but portions are ridiculously small.  If you order the 1/2 sandwich with salad or soup, it is literally a 2\" X 2\" square.  Way overpriced for the amount of food, same with pastry.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"today I came into panera at 5:25 pm and I ordered a bread bowl and they apparently has NO BREAD , first off how does that ever happen.. anyways, then I ordered a cookie as they also told me they had none of those as well and wouldn't have any till dinner time. ITS 5:30 at night, I thought this was dinner. but wait it gets better, I wait 35 minutes for my soup to come out AND IT WAS COLD, half way threw I found a long black hair in my soup and my hair is blonde so I know it wasn't mine... they had the rudest employees & horrible service. I would NOT recommend this restraraunt to anyone."}
{"text":"Not sure if it's just this location or if Panera has gotten stingy with their soup but I ordered a bread bowl and the little bit of soup they gave me barely filled a quarter of the bread bowl. The bread ended up soaking up most of the soup so there turned it to be maybe 5 spoonfuls of soup to actually eat. It used to not be like this, the soup would fill almost to the top of the bread bowl. Not sure if the bread bowls are getting bigger or if they're giving less soup. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Hate it they gave me a samwich with bacon i did not oder then put old cheese on top of it and burned the food it was such simple meal but thats  some bol carp"}
{"text":"An update on the earlier review. After sitting and waiting around for 20 mins or so, someome finally remembered that they needed to do something official about it so a guy came over and asked if I was OK and I would like to file a report. On the report all I was asked to do was put in my contact details and not anything about what was wrong. was told I will be contacted soon for my version of the story. Its been 3 days already and no signs of any contact - have started developing pains on my back spine already."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Pictures look nothing like the products they serve. The staff is rude and the customer service is very poor. Don't waste your time. There are so many other options in the area with better prices and better food."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill! Twice I had to take sandwiches back. The first time after receiving two small fragments of bacon! They corrected it. This time the manager said she would charge me! 3 chunks of turkey and 4 spinach leaves! Management is not friendly at all!"}
{"text":"I typically phone in my order which is quite cumbersome at times. Lately they've only started making my order when I arrive! It took 50 minutes from the time I called until my food was finished recently. To top it off, the order was incomplete and I had to go back inside. I'd suggest checking the bag thoroughly before you leave. Staff seem disinterested, but the food is good"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy the paradise bakery that was at this location. The food was fresh and they made it right in front of you. This place just seems so automated from the get-go that I wonder who or what is making my food. 

Walking in the door: the flow of the restaurant is very congested. You have to struggle past the people \"avoiding the line\" by using kiosks just to get to the line. Then, after you place your order, you have to squeeze past them again to the beverage station. It's just a stupid design. 

The food:  I ordered a sandwich, which I have no complaints about, and when asked what side I wanted, I chose apples instead of chips. When my sandwich came, I was surprised and appalled to see an entire un-sliced apple on my plate next to my sandwich. Not only is this poor plate presentation, it just seems lazy. 

I most likely won't be back. The food is mediocre, the chairs uncomfortable, the awkward traffic at the front door is annoying, and they are too darn busy doing whatever else to core and slice an apple."}
{"text":"One star because the soup isn't horrible. Ordered half a tuna sandwich. What wasn't clear is that item is a small sandwich with tuna on half.  Really more a quarter sand which. Husband's sandwich tasted like paste. As for service. Someone needs to explain the concept of actually clearing and, here's the crazy part, wiping down the tables."}
{"text":"Came in for a little me time and wanted to use my free birthday pastry. I came in pretty late in the day so most of the pastries were gone so I opted for the Carrot Cake cupcake and also got my favourite Chai Tea Latte. 

In terms of the cupcake, I couldn't handle the sweetness of icing on top so I took it off and just ate the 'meaty' part of the cake until I found that the middle was stuffed with more of the icing and I just couldn't. It was pretty mediocre. 

My latte didn't come for a while and one of the employees came around to ask if I ordered a chai tea latte and if I've received it yet and when I said that I hadn't he said said he'll go prepare it and bring it now. Fast forward another 15 minutes, I still didn't have my latte so I asked another employee who had to put in the order to begin with and brought it by. 

It was also extremely cold in there lol. I thought it was just me but I kept overhearing customers complaining about. It was almost a relief to walk outside in the heat. 

So far, I've only had good experiences with Panera in the morning :("}
{"text":"This location is the worst. I keep trying but shame on me 3rd and final mess up is the last. 

Love Panera hate this location"}
{"text":"Panera: it is what it is.  

A perfectly adequate place for coffee, a sandwich, pastries, whatever.  (OK--I take the coffee part back, because I've been to several different locations and have never cared for the coffee.)  The service has been fine the few times I've been here. The food is okey-dokey but completely unremarkable. I'd describe what I ate today, but why bother? I already don't remember what it was.  See what I mean?  An unintended plus to today's outdoor dining experience: being entertained as I watched people react with varying degrees of horror as they clapped their peepers on a couple of mice frolicking under one of the tables. But I digress.  

In sum: if you come here for fine dining you're bound to be disappointed (p.s. you're bonkers, so you deserve what you get).  

Panera: at the pinnacle of mediocrity.  It is what it is."}
{"text":"not a great experience at all since it changed from paradise bakery. the cashier was very rude and seemed miserable to be working. ordered a salad and soup and the salad was 50% wilted and no flavor whatsoever, and the soup was very very bland. definitely not impressed and spent way too much for bad food ):"}
{"text":"Parking was a nightmare and I quickly made the decision that walking from the residential block behind the strip of commercial property would be easier than waiting for a spot to open up. I ordered the Cranberry Turkey sandwich and it was kind of sad and sparse looking. It was dripping (I think maybe from the tomato) and the bread was soggy when it arrived. I debated taking it back, but decided that I would just live with it because I was super hungry. On the upside, the cookie was good. I wouldn't order the sandwich again."}
{"text":"I ordered online for pick up and it was ready before i arrived 13 minutes later.  That's great considering I've waited almost 30 minutes in drive thru at a fast food resturant before having to be to work. I ordered a complete meal for my fiance and i, & it was very good. The only reason i am not giving a 5 star is because the woman i dealt with when i ordered an extra pastry upon my arrival, was very ride,  & seemed irritated with the fact that i wanted more food. . In turn spending more money. But whatever. My steak & cheese panini was amazing, along with my chicken & rice soup. Of course i got a blueberry muffin as well."}
{"text":"Very bad experience in this location. Been a customer for a year now till My last visit in November.  Ordered to go food total of close to $100. Called management and told them what the problem was with my order. Manager that day was not a help at all. Decided to write to Corporate office and hoping they would help me too. Customer support/  corporate office was a JOKE. They lost a loyal customer"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for a sophisticated chain eatery! 
The thing that really struck me was that they were doing a fund raiser with a local charity- something that corporates usually frown upon. But this gave the place such a personal neighbor hood touch. Plus the free wifi is a bonus."}
{"text":"I've ordered to go from this location 3 times and every single time they forget my cookie. It used to be back in the day, you get a cookie as part of a pick 2 meal. Now you have to pay for the cookie and still don't get it. Lame."}
{"text":"Don't order soup in a bread bowl. You'll end up with a half cup of soup in the bread bowl. Had to buy an extra cup of soup to be able to actually use the bread in the bread bowl. They have gone so far down hill since Panera took over Paradise Bakery."}
{"text":"Slow service, unconcerned wait staff, and a changed menu that does not compete well with the old Panera menu.

Waited about 15 minutes to get served. Ordered soup because the salad I used to like was gone and the \"replacement\" salad was not at all appealing. The soup was cold, and the bowl was only half filled. Went back to get it fixed and gave up after another 10 minutes.

And \"clean food\"? Seriously? What were people eating before? Filth?"}
{"text":"We eat at this location (Graham Road) every single week and it broke my heart a little to read some of these reviews. We love the place. They have always been fast and the manager tries to accommodate you when something is not quite right as quickly as possible which is not often. The food is a lot more healthy than fast food and that is why it is our weekly luncheon eatery. LOVE the soups, salads and they are a great place to eat when you are on a healthy eating diet plan or NOT. To be honest I have never been to a bad Panera yet and I hope I never do."}
{"text":"Worst Panera ever!!! Dirty disgusting restrooms, too slow on taking order, dirty sticky tables!!! I have been studying at Panera for months due to being a mom of two. I have been to Robinson, Summit Park, east side and other places in states.This one is the worst location ever no doubt!"}
{"text":"Panera bread used to have French bread loaf (miche, not baguette) then they took that away. Just found out they don't have Country any more.

Taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Mmehh.  I usually love pan era - it's my go-to of the fast food world.  Today at this  location my soup was cold and my sandwich was tasteless and falling apart.  Also the food seemed extra salty.  First time to this location - maybe they were just having an off day?"}
{"text":"This is also the second time in two tries for me. Pleasant people poor service. Both times they said they would bring order to our table and did not. Both times I had go look for it and it was left cold on the counter. Poor communication!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place needs to get it together. This is not my first time here and I felt like it was time to share my frustration. I really like Paradise Bakery. Their food is consistently good and usually so is the staff. But, I'm always irritated when I leave this location. Tonight the panini machine was down, so no hot sandwiches which is understandable, things happen. Then I ordered soup and I asked about the dinner roll that comes with the it because my husband was really wanting one and Shayla told me they were out. While paying I asked the guy ringing me up if he could substitute another bread, they are a bakery after all. He offered a croissant. Perfect! Then, this same Shayla started arguing with him in front of me telling him he couldn't do that and to give me a slice of bread. Super unprofessional and rude. Way to win repeat customers. As I was walking out, I checked my bag and realized they didn't give me the yogurt or the cookie that comes with the kids meal I ordered. I went back to ask for it and another employee snickered to the check out guy like I didn't order a kids meal and said something like \"just give it to her.\" I don't know what the deal is here, but everyone is in a bad mood. Too bad since they're right down the street from our home. We'll probably try and avoid coming here in the future."}
{"text":"It's a Panera, so you'd think they'd all be the same across the board. However, this one isn't nearly as good as other Paneras I've been to in NE Ohio (Mayfield Heights, Willoughby, etc.)

The food tastes great, but as other reviewers have mentioned, the employees slap the food together without any care or attention to detail. 

As I was waiting for my food, I watched one employee place a wrap-type of sandwich on a plate for another customer, only for it to unfold right in front of her. 

Did she fold it back up into its prior shape? Nope. She just left it like that for the customer. 

Also, the tables and chairs in the seating area, while plentiful, do not appear to be cleaned very often. However, the restrooms were in good shape. 

Ample parking is available in their large, free lot. 

Overall, if you're craving Panera, take a trip to the one at Golden Gate in Mayfield Heights. It's far and away the better choice."}
{"text":"Food is standard for Panera, very friendly staff. One of the reasons many come here is to meet or work and use the WiFi. The WiFi is awful. Keeps cutting out. When it works, the speed is decent but that's WHEN it's working. Need to stream music/video, forget it. Was trying to write reports and stream some music to keep me going, was more of a distraction to lose my music every few minutes.
Great outdoor seating even though it's on a busy street.
Great for kids, quick food and friendly staff help."}
{"text":"Bleh.  The soup was cold and the sandwiches were not very good.  $40 for a family of 3 for lunch?  Nah, not doing this again.  YMMV."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I asked an employee if a sandwich sitting on the serving bar was mine and she kept making smart/sarcastic/rude comments about it while rolling her eyes and snickering with other employees. It was unnecessary to make a customer feel uncomfortable for asking a question. 
I talked to the manager. She apologized and said she will talk to the employee, but I will not return to this spot. 
I want to enjoy my food, not feel hostile to ask a simple question. Usually panera has great customer service but I was disappointed with the level of service at this location."}
{"text":"Stay away from the Soba Noodle Bowl.   Good amount of chicken, over cooked soba noodles, 2 leaves of spinch and a small shaving of cabbage.  Poorly flavoured broth...completely Asian Uninspired.  Small portion for 10 bucks.  Will stick to Asian restaurants who will provide a flavourful noodle bowl under $10 bucks that will be fulfilling and flavourful.  Stick to your sandwiches folks......"}
{"text":"I love panera bread. Never disappointed when I come here. Quick and easy. The pick two is awesome!"}
{"text":"Stopped at the Panera Bread in the mall. I was cold from too much air conditioning and wanted a coffee, but since it was 7:00 PM I wanted decaf. The girl behind the counter said well it would take about 5 minutes to brew it, is that okay? I said yes...but then she stood there and tried to convince me that they have 2 flavored options available and wouldn't I rather have those. After being made to feel bad because she'd have to brew a pot of coffee I asked her didn't they usually have decaf at night- she said no. So I just said never mind and left. Wouldn't want to put her out or anything"}
{"text":"Just a quick sum up. Myself and a guest ordered 2 BLTs and 2 waters. The sandwiches were mediocre at best. Total tab $16. Ill stick to subway anyday"}
{"text":"Good food but odd that they lost my lunch order. Thanks to those manning the counter who realized I was waiting and filled the order on the spot."}
{"text":"Before Paradise turned into Panera, we always had terrible service at this location and inaccurate orders. We gave Panera a try hoping they would be different...but it's the same problems! We went in for dinner and there was one couple ahead of us ordering cookies. There was one employee helping them out and I counted 3 others mindlessly walking around behind the counter without a word to us or the now 4 other groups behind us.  Eventually a 4th woman, I'll assume the manager based on how she was dressed compared to the others, rudely came out and said she'd help us. She had no enthusiasm, no apology for the 15 minutes we'd already waited, and had zero friendliness...not even a smile. We placed our order and took a seat in the next-to-empty dining area. When our order came out it was all wrong. We mentioned it to the girl and she giggled like she was embarrassed and did nothing to offer to correct it. So there we sat and ate our inaccurate order not wanting to deal again with the rude manager and risk getting our food spit in or messed with some other way. The food itself was ok...the salad was mostly hard iceberg hearts. Needless to say, we will never be going back here."}
{"text":"Why would Panera buy out Paradise when they can't even compare? So disappointed that they removed our beautiful, large, friendly, always-good salads and sandwiches (at Paradise... Queen Creek & Alma School) for this \"joke\" of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Panera is an incredible place and all the employees are so warm hearted and kind. I love the nutritious food and the speciality drinks! My favorite is the caramel latte and they make it perfectly each time! I love Panera!"}
{"text":"I've never been to Panera bread before today. I was pleasantly surprised! Upon first appearance, the decor was simple, the display was basic, nothing really stood out to be different from any other location. And the main entrance was at a terrible location, I feel the whole layout should be reversed, but hey, I'm no architect.

When my family all arrived, we ordered. I noticed the food prices were on the high end of fast food. Like subway, depending on the ingredients, their items fell into different price categories. My half sandwich was almost $8!! 

Once we ordered, we got a tracker with our bill.  Within a few minutes a gentleman was bringing our food to the table. It was all warm where it should have been.  My first appearance, my portion was fairly small, but gosh dammit were the ingredients REAL and FRESH. The avocado was a ripe green - no brown, the chicken had texture like it came off a bone and not pressed into a patty, the cheese was thick and glorious!!! The sauce was lovely and aromatic with a hint of spice (as I got chipotle). The bread was tasty and grilled to perfection.  I finished and had room for the chips it came with right away. Finishing my meal - for me - means I could have ordered the full sized sandwich.

I got thirsty and went back to get a bottle of water. It was standard Nestle bottle that costs $0.25 or $0.10 if they're on sale.... for $2.10. What a freaking rip-off. I notice I could have water from the soda dispenser afterward.

Anyway, price aside, I was really impressed with the ingredients. I would gladly go back, it would be great if you and a friend could agree on a sandwich and split a regular one with a side."}
{"text":"good food, but the layout for the seating is not very nice... the tables are too close together! 
I like the layout better in Monroeville better! 
The servers are always nice"}
{"text":"I have been a long time fan of Panera, since it's beginning.  I will not go to this Panera again.  They have the good food I expect from Panera, but this location is so stingy with everything, I can't enjoy eating it as I look down at so little food for the money.  I ordered a pick 2 today, Chicken Cobb with Avocado (signature supreme) and a tomato soup.  For $15 I got half a small box of salad with 1 small container of dressing 1/4 full.  Really?  1/4 full?  And a small box is a small portion.  Fill it and it's a small.  Fill it half way.....it's not a small salad, it's robbery.  Panera fan or not...DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION unless you want to feel sick to your stomach for paying $15 for a snack."}
{"text":"This chain has gone from great to good to fair to horrible. I was looking for a good ice coffee and yuck. Watered down and horrible taste. They got rid of there best food and replaced it with bland \"clean\" food. It's dinner time and no one is here. Who ever made the decisions to make these changes needs to go back to school. I miss the old Paradise Bakery."}
{"text":"Passing through Indian Trail, this establishment caught my attention. Greetings as the door create a homely environment instantaneously. The display of all the fine breads, pastries, and muffins was an irresistible temptation. 
I'm not a frequent stopper at Panera Bread; this experience shall change that. 
I enjoyed a caramel latté brewed to perfection, topped with whipped cream, along with a drizzled goodness of caramel. 
In need of a healthy choice, I selected the Smokehouse Turkey Panini, which was an exceptionally gourmet meal. 
Very friendly staff complete the experience, as you unwind to calm music played. Store team is passionate about what they offer, and pride themselves in keeping a clean environment. There is ample room to sit outside in covered and elegantly decorated areas."}
{"text":"I am part of an organization that meets for dinner and a meeting once a month. We had organized with the manager to use the private room.  We had used it a few times in the past and never had any problem.  In fact, for previous meetings, the staff couldn't have been nicer, friendlier or more professional.

Although we called to confirm the room in the afternoon and were told that everything was on track, when we arrived, the so-called manager, Judy, had no idea we were coming and told us that, unless she was told about it by the catering department, there was nothing she could do.  No empathy, no customer service - just \"sorry, you're out of luck.\"

So, we went into the room and attempted to setup for our meeting.  That is when Judy and another manager, who was equally as untrained in working with the public, came in and explained that we were not entitled to the private room.  In fact, they chastised us (THE CUSTOMERS) for trying to use the room.  They claim that the private room is no longer a private room and \"corporate\" has told them they are no longer allowed to reserve it.  We were being lectured for trying to give them our money.  We found that very difficult to believe as we were confirmed in the room THAT AFTERNOON.

If the restaurant was packed and they had more business than they knew what to do with, I can see some justification for this pathetic level of customer service.  However, it wasn't.  The place was quite empty.  It seems to me that, on the traditionally slowest night of the week in the restaurant industry (Monday), a savvy restaurant would try to get as many customers as they could.  We are not a huge group, but we usually have around 20 people that ALWAYS order dinner.    

Before posting here, I wrote to their customer service department and my email was ignored.  I have been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and have never seen such poor customer service.  Needless to say, we will be taking our monthly meetings elsewhere.  Furthermore, our entire membership (forty people) will be refraining from ever eating a Panera again.  It's a shame because the food and service at Paradise Bakery was always top level."}
{"text":"I frequent this Panera and usually am quite satisfied. Today 5/15/17 my husband and I went way after the lunch rush. About 3:00 pm. Upon ordering the cashier was great, no complaints. She informed me that the Fuji apple chicken salad could only be made today with real apples as they had run out of the dried apples. I agreed that would be just fine. When I received my salad, the apple was cut in about 6 wedges, both ends of the stem included. It was thrown in the salad and was NOT done with any care. I had to pick them out. To top it off, I was given no dressing and had to go interrupt the workers that were mostly disinterested if I could get dressing. Additionally the place was a mess and a female employee at the pick up counter (customer side) was playing around with a coworker behind the counter so loud that it was quite annoying. Laughing and acting as though they were at the pool. 
So disappointed in this visit. I hope it was a fluke."}
{"text":"This location is a good size restaurant and the food is really good. Although they're a bit on the pricier side the food is always fresh. The staff is usually always nice and smiling which is enjoyable. I go here for personal lunches and also do business lunches at this location."}
{"text":"I really try to like this place but it's only worth one or two visits a year and half of those are bad. Last time I visited I ordered one of your sandwiches that had the turkey and bacon and got no bacon. Took forever to get the bacon which came out floppy fatty and gross. Then yesterday I got a bagel with cream cheese and when I got home to eat it there were not 1 but 2 disgusting black hairs inside my bagel. You all are terribly over priced and must be making one hell of a killing on your \"perfectly measured\" out portions. Please get better Paradise! We all want to love you!"}
{"text":"You order and they fill out something that looks like a tax form, hand you a metal rod with a number on it, take the tax form to another person behind the counter that makes your sandwich, they hand you the sandwich and you hand them the metal rod and go to the register.  Anyone else seeing too many steps in this transaction?  I'm pretty sure they are running some kind of practical joke show and airing it on some channel I'm unaware of.  How else do you explain that insanity?  Does Paradise Bakery own stock in carbon paper or something?"}
{"text":"Horrible food horrible customer service and the GM is worthless (Mark)! Food came out wrong with cold cheese and told them order was wrong and didn't offer to correct will not be back!"}
{"text":"Worst panera bread ever!!! Coming from a Florida resident fresh off the plane and very hungry. Was very excited to see that this location had a drive thru. But anyways..... My salad was so ugly, wish I took a picture but what really topped it off was the quarter of an avocado they put on it!!! I'm okay with being charged a .99 for avocado but at least give me at least half! Can you say refund? Sheeesh get it together"}
{"text":"Ordered a You Pick Two special,and got a half-serving of both their Caesar salad and steak and cheese panini. In addition, I had a watermelon lenkbade, all of which totalled $18.91.

The Caesar salad was alrigjt, just the right amount of dressing. The sandwich was inedible for me because of the horseradish which really burned. They kindly offered me another sans horseradish, and a lot less steak. The watermelon lemonade was good and refreshing.

The food is average at best, certainly not worth the price tag."}
{"text":"I ordered a Pick 2 to go, which was a soup & salad. The salad I ordered was the Chicken Southwestern Caesar Salad. I got home, ate my soup first because I always leave the best part for last which is my salad. Come to my surprise it was def not my Chicken Southwestern Salad. Since I live around the corner, I went back to get it fixed. They apologized & said they'd make me one right away. They gave me my salad & didn't hesitate to look & check to make everything was all good since I was sure it wouldn't happen again. So I get home & guess what, they didn't add chicken on my salad. I'm writing this review because it's not the first time it's happened. I stop going for a while but I was really craving their salad but yet again, they've failed me. I'd rather drive 10 miles for Paradise Bakery. Eff you Panera."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I found out a Panera was opening closer to our house. I was going to stop in but my son fell asleep in the car so I decided to do the drive thru instead. Do they not have to-go containers here? My sandwich was wrapped in paper only and not even covered all the way. My baguette was just sitting in the paper bag. The lady taking my order and the one who gave me my food were both extremely friendly, but I'm a little disappointed with how the food was \"served\". I've order take out before from other Panera's and it hasn't been like this. If I had waited until I got home, my sandwich might have been dried out. But because I ate in my car, it was a little messy not having anything containing my food. Wonder how they would have served me soup if I had ordered that!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is spacious and decorated nicely.  I like to go there for bagels, salads and soups.  Their salads are especially good ,  as are their soups.  I do like the variety of bagels they have as well.  I'm not that fond of their sandwiches, though,  which are mainly bread with some kind of  filling."}
{"text":"Food is always good. I wish the portions were bigger. It is a little pricey for what you get. A family of 4 with drinks usually is $45+"}
{"text":"One star due to management and accuracy.
I love Panera and was so thrilled it came to a location near me!! And then this happened... :(
The food was great, but this is the 3rd time I've been to this Panera since it opened and each time order is inaccurate. This time I was double charged for food which I kindly brought to an employee's attention she then got the mgr where he began to question ME the customer! In short, I felt insulted and he was reluctant to give me back my refund. It was very disappointing and I left with a sour taste in my mouth. It was a big OUCH. I mean I really love Panera and I was trying to figure out how to bring my coworkers there because they said it was a little pricey but I always thought that they would eventually come around. But now,  I'm sad and I won't do that. 
Hello Jason's Deli..."}
{"text":"probably the worst panera ive been to. i dont even know why Ive given them so many chances. can they for once have the items you order in stock? and if not why. not offer a discount on something else? the service here is horrendous. truly lacking in comparison to other paneras. this is the last time i will be stepping into this shop."}
{"text":"If I could give this Panera 0 stars I would but that's not an option. Cold soup & forgot my mac n cheese!"}
{"text":"Pumpkin muffins at Paradise Bakery have a crunchy crumble top and big chunks of black walnuts inside .They are sumptuous and make my mouth water, thinking about them . 
Be early or else they will be sold out ! i have been disappointed a few times when that happened.
Their soups are excellent and taste homemade. 
A great concept restaurant and this is one of their best locations."}
{"text":"If you want great service and quality food this is the place ! I'm giving this location five stars . As I walked in a gentleman open the door handed me a menu as there was a line ahead of me. As I got to register I told the cashier it was my first time here and she recommended a chipotle sandwich which I did end up ordering , as I walked to the table my server Marco was so attentive to detail he delivered my food as I ordered it and just made me feel at home. I can honestly say I will be coming back here . Fast, quality , and best service this is the place to come !"}
{"text":"Great place for business breakfast meetings! Food is really good, always fresh, and the flavored coffee is good."}
{"text":"I think it's some sort of law that if you live in Lebo and have young kids, you must visit this place at least twice a month or the authorities will, like, confiscate your GymBucks. At lunchtime it's absolutely overrun w/ small kids. But the food is reliable, the bread is genuinely good, and-- pregnant women take note-- there's caffeine-free Diet Pepsi in the fountain. I appreciate the free wifi."}
{"text":"Had the worst salad of my life at this place. Would never go back even change the lettuce but it still sucked. Manager brought back a new salad and said it was new lettuce but didn't taste much different. She was nice but food was not good."}
{"text":"The customer service there was great. But that's about it. Went for a quick lunch with my bf. Both got a half sandwich, I got a salad he got soup. Both had a small drink and a cookie. All together  $30 just for that! The half sandwich was tiny, salad was good and soup was good. But definitely not worth the price at all. We could've gone to a decent sit down restaurant for that price. Never going back again."}
{"text":"The soup here was great and really liked the chicken sandwich I had.  Not sure why people are complaining about the kiosks, you can go right to the counter and order like we did.  We went around six in the evening and we were checked out quickly and the food was also delivered quickly.  Good experience all around.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I like Panera and I live close by this one, so it took a lot to put me off from this location. But the South Euclid location earned my ire. Fully 25% of the time the coffee is full of grounds. (Once when I tried switching flavors because the first one I picked had grinds in it, I had to go through four different urns before I found one that had no grinds in it.) Ordering online, my order was wrong at least two thirds of the time. With rare exceptions the staff is slow, morose, and clueless. On top of that, my favorite menu items were discontinued. And they're often out of items that are on the menu. It's a shame that the Panera location closest to me is so bad. I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm from SoCal, and come to Phx often for biz. I'm a fan of Paradise Bakery in general, but was really disappointed with this one.  I ordered a cuban, and gotta say it was pretty much the worst. Mostly bread - crappy bread and not chibatta-- one puny slice of ham, it wasn't grilled, and it took almost 20 minutes - super disappointing, and for $8 not a good value at all. Also got a cup of soup - it was good -- but for a total order of $12, I'm over the free cookie.  

I got this to go for my road trip, and (frankly) gave a good part of it to the dog.  I probably should've gotten something from the Whole Foods next door, or even a $5 foot long....Where's a subway when you need one?

Lots of people waiting for food at 11 am, long line.  Others seemed to know the service was terrible and stuck to salads and pre-prepared things. 

I've had good experiences with other locations -- probably not going here again."}
{"text":"I went to this location for the first time today. There are three ways to order: Stand in line like normal, use a touchscreen to avoid standing in the line, or use the drive through.

There was no line, so I ordered at the register. The staff member I dealt with was very nice. My order was handed to me personally when it was done. The staff member then asked if I wanted a menu because I was interested in other food options.

The food was excellent and well prepared. It's very similar to other experiences at different Panera locations. I'm glad we have this dining option in SW Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this location! I tried to order food for 12 people in the Hospital today. Tried to place the order at 9:30 and was told they couldn't accommodate. Only 90 minute notice! Wow"}
{"text":"If there was an option for zero stars I would have selected that instead. This location is horrible. I went in and ordered soup and half a sandwich to go. I was given my soup and waited in line for about 10-15 minutes for my sandwich. They appeared to be completely unorganized and understaffed.  On top of the long wait and poor service my food was horrible. The \"bacon\" on my sandwich was not edible. I have ordered the same meal (french onion soup and the turkey avocado sandwich numerous times at the San Tan location and the food was amazing. The food at the Ray Rd location tasted nothing like the San Tan location. I was very disappointed and will not be returning to the ray rd location."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere.  Love the bread soup bowels too."}
{"text":"Just ate Panera today on Howe Avenue  had pesto veggie soup and Mediterranean Quinoa salad. It was delicious service is always good. They could really use a good cleaning in dining area. I will go again soon."}
{"text":"I love Panera 's food but the service at this location is seriously poor. I have a mobility challenge and so I ordered from the outside table using their app--which is a great idea! The manager delivered my food to me with no silverware and no drink. He said I could go inside to get my drink. Does that make sense when I ordered from the table to avoid going inside? He did bring my silverware finally but no drink. Again not my favorite place and its Due to the poor service and lack of common sense"}
{"text":"One of the chains that I look forward to seeing every time I'm back visiting my family. Probably the best bread you will find (from a chain) but it definitely comes at a price (sometimes $5 a loaf!) the bakery is good and the sandwiches, soups and salads are great but not always as healthy you you might think. Anyways, I highly recommend the broccoli and cheese soup bread bowl or the tuna sandwich. Surprisingly, I don't believe they have any vegetarian salads, which is a bit ridiculous (or they might only have 1 but that's the cesar salad with croutons and cheese, nothing else)! I'm not such a big fan of all their new items (pastas, some soups and salads) and wish they would expand their vegetarian options a bit.

This particular location is nice, staff are friendly but usually super busy. Downside is the long wait times during especially the lunch time hours."}
{"text":"I have never had a lunch at Panera that I liked.  The sandwiches are all weirdly greasy or bland or both.  However, the Asiago cheese bagel makes for a pretty sweet breakfast."}
{"text":"Ordered through rapid pick up, which was supposed to be ready at 2:09. When we get there, (at about 2:15) our order isn't in the shelf, and the man working informed us it would be ready soon. Then, after a few minutes, they call us back up and tell us the bread choices for the sandwiches we chose were not available and what we wanted instead. Instead of calling us with the phone number provided, they waited until we were there to let us know and prepare our food. We ended up having to wait until 2:34 for our food, where our side bread was sloppily thrown into our bag. I'm not sure what the point of rapid pick up is when it isn't ready 5-10 minutes, but instead almost 30. I could have just ordered the food there, or went through the drive thru, and it would have been faster. I will not be returning to this Panera location."}
{"text":"Best panera in the valley. They are quick, accurate, extremely friendly and happy to help. The manager Mike took care of all of our needs and went above and beyond to provide amazing service. Thank you panera we love you."}
{"text":"Ordered a bagel with cream cheese to go and was pretty amazed at how they served it.

Had to put the cream cheese on myself rather than them do it. By the time I got to a place where I could do it, my bagel was cold. Too bad....."}
{"text":"By far the worst experience ever. Un friendly staff needs to be trained again. I ended up having to get dinner somewhere else! We ordered 2 pick 2 meals and a cookie. We used the order kiosk. While waiting for our food we noticed the food was getting backed up because the person delivering food seemed confused and was moving very slow. I saw our order so I got up from our table and retrieved it. The cookie was missing so I asked for it. I was then told by a not so friendly worker they were out of the type of cookie we ordered and that I should pick a new kind. Then when I got to the table I noticed my sandwich was wrong. I ordered the vegetarian sandwich with no tomatoes, no lettuce and add spinach. I noticed it had lettuce so I brought it back and they informed me they were out of spinach and that's why it had lettuce. So I go back to my table and that's when I realized it was KALE not lettuce. I was so frustrated at this point that I brought it back and spoke to who I thought was a manager and shared my frustrations. She said she needed my card to give me a refund so I said I was going to eat my soup and then I would bring it to her. I went and sat down with my mom and as I put my spoon in my mouth Angel ran over saying \"I need your card\". I literally can't find the words to express how rude and inappropriate it was for her to do that. I told her I was going to finish my soup and then I would come get her. When I was done I went to get her and she couldn't be found so the actual manager helped me. I didn't feel like she really even cared or truly felt bad about my horrible experience. I will never return to this location. I honestly wish it was still paradise bakery. I will be letting everyone I know that this location has horrible customer service and untrained associates that make choices about your order without consulting you. The management really needs to be more approachable and actually show genuine care for their patrons."}
{"text":"Since when did pick 2 become pick a quarter and a half?
I ordered a tomato soup and a half Mediterranean sandwich. The bread they used for sandwich was so small that everything was literally falling out...looked more like a quarter sandwich.
Also dont expect the employees to read any special instructions...they just follow the normal routine no matter what the order says."}
{"text":"Normally I have a OK expereince when I DINE IN at this Panera Bread location. I usually get the Greek Salad with Chicken. When I dine in, the salad is huge..served in a nice big bowl. BUT, not once, but 2 times now when I ordered this salad, the portion was TINY!!  I could not believe how there was less of everything, chicken, lettuce, feta! I was so disappointed. I will probably not order this as take-out again during lunch time. Are the cooks over serving the portions in the restaurant or under serving the portions for take-out orders??"}
{"text":"First of all, I am a Panera Bread LOVER!  However, this location was different.  Our breakfast sandwiches (egg / turkey sausage) were unedibile.  After the first bite there was a strong after taste. The only food up to par was the fresh fruit cup.  Ususally the staff are very nice and friendly at other locations, not the case here."}
{"text":"Panera is a cozy and friendly place to eat a meal on the run or to relax and enjoy coffee with your friends.  I frequently study here because the coffee refills are free and the booths have outlets for my computer.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Food is subpar, they are very cheap with portions, and quality and customer service have gone way down over the years, they wanted to charge me for a tablespoon worth of extra almonds on an Asian salad, when comparing to Fired Pie where any and as many  toppings for your salad is included, it's hard to even try this place anymore, but I thought I would try once more to give them another chance, since I am quite sure they have lost salad business to FP. It used to be a good place , good food, nice owners. I  don't  see how they can continue to stay open much longer with all the new places that give more for the money and tastes better..."}
{"text":"Will not return. I've been to this particular Panera twice now, several months apart. The first time I ordered, sat down and waited 20 minutes for the wrong order to be delivered to my table. They took it back and I waited another 15 minutes for the correct order to be brought to my table. Second time I went in to order only a bowl of soup to eat there but my order came out in a to-go bag. I understand that Panera is not considered \"fast food\", but there is absolutely no sense of urgency by any employees at this location. I would suggest only going to this location if you have plenty of extra time and patience to spare."}
{"text":"I don't usually like chains, but I'm so happy that this Panera exists.  It's a great location, and it's nice to have somewhere to escape from the rain or cold (hey, it's Pittsburgh, the weather sucks).  I like Dozen Cupcakes better for the cuteness, but Panera is more convenient for using wifi and escaping from people.  I've come here with friends too, though.

As far as I know, the food is the same at every Panera, which can be a good thing.  It sure beats McDonald's when I'm somewhere unfamiliar."}
{"text":"Panera's is a great place to go for a quick lunch or dinner in a casual and comfortable atmosphere!  I was there today with my family and enjoyed the new Shrimp Salad Roll with the French Onion soup and lemonade - yum!  Their bakery items are yummy, as well, and you don't tip because you pick up your ordered food at the counter."}
{"text":"Well, after all that shopping I did today. I was starving. decide to try the Panera Bread Company because I never have tried it delicious paninis there the price is mediocre average and the food is very good quality I will definitely be going there again however I don't know if I would make a trip specially just to go there."}
{"text":"Just went in here to purchase two dozen bagels for the office I work at. More than half of the variety of the bagels were gone and I was told that is all they had available. It is not even 7:30am yet. Very disappointing that Panera would not keep a full stock of their variety available at this time if day."}
{"text":"Always good service, my order has been wrong a few times but they Alway correct it without question..."}
{"text":"Ebony and Alessandra made my day! They couldn't find a manager to help with my payment so rather than make me wait, they told me my meal was on them and to have a great day. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"So, I've read reviews and heard nice things about Panera Bread. I happened to be at Boca so popped in to read whilst sipping cappuccino. A blueberry scone called my name as I waited in line. 
Guy at the counter: is that for here or to go? 
Me: here. 
Him: do you have a Panera Bread card?
Me: No. 
Him: Want one?
Me: Suuuure! (Because of what I'd heard I thought I'd be back...why not?)
Him: Oh, we don't have any. 
Me: (still standing there smiling gormlessly in a pregnant pause having paid and been given my scone on a cheap plastic plate) Umm...a cappuccino?
Him: Oh, that's around the corner. (Why not tell me so as you hand me my scone?)

Around the corner. Woman makes two cappuccinos and takes them out to a table. I stand there smiling awaiting my capp. Guy asks if he can help me. Yup. I ordered a cappuccino. Oh, she will bring it out to your table (really? How would she even know it was mine?). Ok. Cool. 
A few minutes later the girl shouts \"cappuccino!\" I walk back to the counter to find that she had made it in a paper cup to go. Her dour expression made me think that if she smiled, her face would crack. I said it was for here. No apology, only a half-hearted offer to make another. Her tone conveyed apathy. I decided not to trouble her any further by asking her to correct the order. 

The decor is cheap and ugly. The piped music is hell-invokingly awful on a cheap sound system. The scone was kinda dry ('Bucks do a much yummier scone). Some of the service was mediocre, verging on unpleasant. Me no gusta. I can't think what the fuss about Panera Bread is, and this branch seems terribly out of place in amongst the nicer places this end of Boca. 

Maybe they just had an off day, and we can't know what people are going through, but simple smiles in the service industry can go a long way...they might even have made me consider returning despite the general unpleasantness of the monstrously decorated space, terrible sound system, baaaad music, and mediocre scone. Nah, maybe not..."}
{"text":"The order staff is as dumb as mud. Took over 10 min to order 2 sandwich plates. Plus very pricey"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh, the turkey and avocado sandwich and broth bowls are really good. Orange juice and lemonade are good, but the coffee isn't."}
{"text":"My husband & I both ordered the Frontega Chicken sandwich. I noticed mine was flatter than his so I opened the sandwich and a little more than 1/2 the bread had chicken on it. And what chicken was on the bread was a  small amount.  The restaurant was unusually busy (parking an issue & few tables available.)  We were on a tight schedule so I took a photo of the sandwich and ate it. As we left, the crowd had subsided and there was no line at the counter, so I decided to speak to the manager.  I told him my sandwich was subpar (showed him the photo) and that my husband's sandwich was fine. He replied that the chicken is weighed so sandwiches are all the same. I left in a huff because, basically, he told me I was wrong. Other Panera Bread locations are MUCH better than this one. I enjoy Panera Bread but will steer clear of this one. The general  manager needs to learn better customer service."}
{"text":"After shopping at Kid to Kid last week, I saw that this Panera just opened up. I was like WOW, and then I got excited because I saw a drive thru. So of course I used the drive thru window. 
I ordered a chicken frontega panini and berry smoothie. Both were delicious and the smoothie really took my thirst away because it was so hot outside. It was around noon time. 
The lady taking my order was very nice, but unfortunately they were very slow getting my order out to me. I could see through the rear view mirror the other lady in the car behind me was getting impatient.  The drive thru might be a good idea to get a a coffee but not a meal. It takes too long. They also forgot to ask  me if I wanted chips, bread or an apple for my side. Oh well, I ended up with chips. Good food but be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I keep wanting to give them a chance again and again, but each time I am sadly disappointed. Wrong orders, blah food."}
{"text":"Worst service! Totally unorganized, and inexperienced managers. I placed a to go order at 6:09 over the phone, the server read the order back to confirm and everything's was correct, She said my order would be ready at 6:25. I arrived at 6:30 and went to the pick up counter to pay and pick up my order, then the manager who was at the register there asked me if I placed the order over the phone or online, which I told her over the phone, and she asked me to please get in the really long regular line for my pick up order, which seemed strange, but I did. When I finally got to the register the sales associate read my order to me and it was incorrect, I explained the errors and said it no problem she would have it corrected right away and it would be up in a few minutes. 25 minuets later it still wasn't ready so I found the manager and asked her how much longer it would be? She checked and came back to tell me that they were just getting my soup ready and it would be right up....5 minutes later she walked passed me and saw that I was still there with no food and offered me a free pastry for the trouble which I declined. Then when I get home my order was made and still incorrect!"}
{"text":"Paneras are generally the same. This one falls in line with others. Good service, clean eating area. This is also a great location. Though, of course, I couldn't give it five stars because of the atrocious prices, especially for a drink ($2+ for a tea!). If you like the food and don't mind the cost, you'll love this Panera."}
{"text":"Love the panera food but this location's service is awful. Went for breakfast and there was barely anyone there. There was only one person at the cash and about 4 to  5 people elsewhere in the restaurant. The person at cash was extremely slow and at one point walked away for a good 5 minutes in the middle of taking order. Of the 4 breakfast items we ordered we had to ask for them to give it to us on 4 different occasions. They brought one slice of bread for our order of toast which was untoasted, no butter or jam or cutlery with it. We had to take it back and ask for them to rectify.  The bagel with cream cheese had to be reminded twice before they decided they we had actually ordered and paid for it. I have visited many panera locations in GTA and in the US but never experienced such bad service anywhere. The only reason this has two star is because their food is standard Panera food."}
{"text":"Soups are amazing, love the place, keep coming here twice a week. Highly recommend chicken cream soup- that stuff is delicious!"}
{"text":"Now am not big on customer service but this place socks, a line of 2 which includes me and a lady ahead of me that was taken for ever. They did not greet me or said I'll be right with, nothing... I have gotten treated better at McDonald's and taco bell better than this place... When finally the lady ahead of me was done, the cashier clocked out and for break because her Co workers were waiting on her.. Wow.. Still did not say anything to me... A manager walks up to the register and is ready to take my order still without saying a word.  I worked at panera in Metro center area Phoenix. We never have treated anyone with such poor customer service. The food over priced but if it's made right, it's actually good and by right I mean correct portion, fresh and presentable."}
{"text":"Average - this place has gone down in estimation in my opinion.  It's been at least 5 yrs since Ive been to obe of these joints and I was pretty disappointed with the food. Pick two: pasta & soup. Everything was too salty and portions have gotten much smaller since I can remember :-(  Girls at the counter were very nice though."}
{"text":"I ordered my food I was second in line. I saw my name saying my food is being prepared and then I see other people getting there food after me. I kindly asked the server if she can check on my order and she rudely said I'm am preparing it as it comes in. I said but I was second in line so I'm not understanding this and all she is is that they were short staffed no apologies. It was better when it was paradise. What a bummer because I liked coming here."}
{"text":"Try broccoli cheddar soup! It's amazing!!! Its actually my first time being here but i cannot wait till I come back here again!  Great for light dinner :)"}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick dinner at Panera in rocky river by center ridge on 2/2/17. Very slow service to think that we only ordered a bowl of soup and a grilled cheese sandwich for my son. The grilled cheese sandwich looked like it stayed in the grill for 1 sec. Ridiculous. Not coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow. I felt sorry for the lady running the food as there were so many errors from the kitchen. And since when does Panera deliver the food to the table?  This isn't the only Panera that I've witnessed the standards of servicing slipping at"}
{"text":"First, the food is amazing!  Everything is great, fresh, well made.  Absolutely no complaints with anything they offer, whether it's pastries, coffee, sandwiches, breakfast sandwiches, salads, or soup.  Wish they served Coke products instead of Pepsi, but their ice tea offerings are fantastic so I'm not terribly bothered by this.  My faves: Mac & cheese & Fuji Apple chicken salad.  

Second, my review is based upon their lunch service only and nothing more.  I've been to this particular location several times during the week, during lunch hours 11am - 1pm.  Because my office is a good 20-25 minute drive from The Orleans, I always call my order in for pick up as I'm walking to my car to head their way.

The good news is my order has always been ready & waiting for me upon arrival.  The bad news is by the time I pick it up...my mac & cheese (or whatever hot soup I've ordered) is cold. They have 4 registers but only 2-3 running during lunch service. The line is literally out the door upon arrival. By the time I've waited 10-15 minutes (sometimes longer) in line...well, you see where I'm going with this. What should be a quick in/out to pay & leave...is not.  I do not understand why they can't have a dedicated line for persons like myself.  It's very frustrating.  I'm at the point the next time I phone in my order & arrive only to receive cold _______, to give it back & ask for a new, hot, __________.

They are promoting their \"RAPID PICK UP.\"  See my photo...it promotes avoiding the line by ordering online.  The only way this works is if they have a dedicated register to handle these orders.  Otherwise, what's the point?  At minimum it's false advertising; at best it allows customers, whose office is not near, the option of takeaway...rapid it most certainly will not be."}
{"text":"I love Panera and come to this location quite a bit, not because the service is stellar but out of convenience. I'm at The District on a fairly regular basis. The Eastern/Silverado Ranch location is closest to my home but not necessarily convenient due to the parking lot. 

I have a few favorites I alternate between but I always order the Mac & Cheese. It's my fave!!  The \"free Wi-Fi\" actually works.  Sadly that's about it as far as pluses go. 

Salad portions vary depending on whether your order is take away or not. My experience has been you're shorted on take away.  

The tables ALWAYS need to be cleared and/or wiped down. I was here at 2:30pm today (Saturday) and while the dining area was empty the booths hadn't been cleared and the tables all needed to be wiped down. I walked around looking for a cleaner table before finding one.  I would have been better off sitting outside. 

There never seems to be enough people working the counter during peak times and the rare chance there is they are all extremely slow. How hard is it to take an order and move onto the next person in line?  My visit today had me waiting for over 10 minutes for the employee to take the order from the 2 women ahead of me. Why?  The 3 of them were engaged in their own private convo!!  

Food wise I've never had an issue. Everything I've ever had has always been good & beyond my expectations. Which is why I continue to return. It's a bit pricey at $4.99 for a cup of mac but it's well worth it to me. And the Fuji Apple Chicken salad never disappoints."}
{"text":"I love Paradise Bakery/Panera! this location is my local Panera so I go here when I'm craving something tasty and healthy. I always leave content about the quality of my food ALTHOUGH every time I go, no matter how busy or slow it is, food always arrives 20+ minutes later. This only happens at this location- I get it, food is fresh and is made to order but my 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad should not take 20+ minutes. Last time I went I ordered a green tea and realized there was none AFTER I payed for it- I asked an employee if they were out and she said no, it'll be out soon. Well I waited and waited and received my food and still no tea. I tried to ask the employees walking around but they avoided making eye contact and scurried away when I would come close to them. I went up front to ask for a refund and they stated \"it should be out soon.\" YEAH!? That's what you said 30+ minutes ago and I'm still thirsty! It's a love-hate relationship because I do love the food, but always regret going to this location once I'm there."}
{"text":"There are many varieties of herbal teas & assorted muffins.  My favorite is zucchini nut muffin which is closely followed by carrot.  The cookies are great, too. 

 Walking  to this location saves gas and it's a good workout.  My ideal lunch is soup and salad, or a quiche, or a sandwich or an omelet. Everything I have eaten here is quite tasty and, since I'm a regular here, I can't agree with some of the other reviewers. Generally the wait staff is efficient, friendly and helpful.

 Rating could be a 3.5 stars if they practice a smoother customer line formation and faster service on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Everyone knows that you don't go to Panera Bread for the food. I came here for the restroom, and that's what my stars count toward. 

There is one urinal and one toilet stall wide enough for those who are handicapped. Safety first, and even Panera does a good job of making sure their customers are aware of any wet floors with their stand-up caution cones. The stall door swings in and the lock works fine. My only beef is with the toilet seat covers. They ripped too easily when I tried to peel one out. As a result, I sat down bare-cheeked. 

My only other complaint is that the Wifi connection took too long on my phone. I can only imagine if I were a hungry customer who was too shy to order at the register, and wished to order from my table using Panera's slower-than-casual pace Wifi. 

Props to Panera for having an eco-friendly dual-flush handle.

Only 4 stars because I've been to finer bathrooms in Tijuana."}
{"text":"People do not understand my love for soup. During a heat wave or a snowstorm, you would probably see me devouring some sort of a bowl full of goodness. Panera Bread has lived up to my expectations. Been to this particular locations numerous times and have found the food to be delicious every single time. I love the Sonoma Chicken Stew in a bread bowl. 

I've encountered both good and bad customer service. Sometimes I would ask about the ingredients in a particular soup and would get a snotty reply. Other times I would get my questions answered no problem. It's a hit or a miss!"}
{"text":"I was here for hours. Each time I filled my coffee cup, there was no dark roast.  :-(  But good food. Quick friendly service."}
{"text":"Wonderful addition to boca park guys. I thought the staff was very friendly and the aptmosphere was great. All of my food was fresh, and as for all the slow comments...... ITS NOT FAST FOOD. go to relax"}
{"text":"I love Panera but disappointed they were out of a few thing today. Including what I came for, the broccoli cheddar soup

On the plus side. I discovered a peanut butter cookie that is the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"This location is the worst Panera I've been ever visited. They repeatedly get orders wrong, the service is slow, and their customer service is apathetic. They used to be much better, but started going down hill about a year ago. Not sure what happened but I go to Atlanta Bread now."}
{"text":"Not sure what the others are complaining about, this place is awesome.  Food is just as delicious as I remember it.  They do seem to run out of breadbowls and flatbread, I'm guessing that wouldn't happen if people really didn't like it.  The bread is pricey, it is gourmet bread, but the lunch/dinner menus are no higher than your average restaurant.  They need to open one closer to my house :)."}
{"text":"I ordered  a salad for Take Home several times and the the first time salad it has no dressing , the second time has no dressing again , and third time it has no chicken on it , I guess I gave them three chances right? I swear I will never go back to this restaurant again for incompetent and poor service , they're not even busy and they still mess up my I order. If there's a zero rating here that's my rate to this restaurant ."}
{"text":"I usually the pick two meal deal. You can pick two choices between the cafe salads, soups and cafe sandwiches. The signature salads and signature sandwiches are about $.80 more than the cafe. 

I got the broccoli cheddar soup and the caesar salad. Their broccoli cheddar soup is sooo delicious! Not the thick goopy gunk I get from Einstein Bagels. It has carrots in it and is more of a soupy consistency. The caesar salad was okay. It was topped with Assiago cheese and their own homemade croutons. The boyfriend got the greek salad, topped with red onions, kalamata olives, peppercini pepper with greek dressing. I should have gotten that one too! He also got the turkey mesquite sandwich which I had gotten the last time we went there. 

This time around we got the mango smoothie and the frozen strawberry lemonade! I didn't care much for the mango smoothie. It tasted more like bananas to me than mango, but my boyfriend didn't think so. The frozen strawberry lemonade was nice and tangy and extremely refreshing on this hot and surprisingly humid day! 

They also have freshly baked bread and other treats like bear claws, muffins, cookies, etc. I have not tried any of their baked goods yet."}
{"text":"The service here is generally pretty poor. Probably a 50/50 chance they get something in you order wrong, especially if you make any adjustments or additions to the standard menu item. 
Sometimes they don't have coffee ready despite using the very large, self-serve coffee dispensers.
All in all it's piss poor. The only thing they have going for them is convenience."}
{"text":"This is the worst Panera... I think a bunch of young kids work there that don't really care to pay attention to what goes on each sandwich. I ordered a sandwich and two key toppings were completely missing. I keep seeing low reviews for this location but apparently nothing is being done to improve things there. So sad because I like Panera!"}
{"text":"Came in for coffee and egg soufflé  and had to wait 15 minutes to order even though I was second in line.  One server no back ups.  I ordered an egg soufflé  which I had just seen but when I finally got to place my order it was gone and what that was the only, apperently they don't cook food here.  So I ordered a bear claw and a 4 cheese egg soufflé  of which were indivually placed on plates, what no tray.  I should be in the circus balancing two plates of food, coffee and my bag and work journal.  

There use to be a Paradise Baker that was here in this location which must of recently closed as some signs on windows still said Paradise Bakery.  I can see why it closed, the new Panerai Bread has kept the same inefficient manager and staff that was in the non performing Paradise Bakery.

Go somewhere else for your coffee and roll, Starbucks is just south of this location it you will be happy you stayed away from this horrible Panerai bread place.  

If you are a tourist do not come to this restaurant there are much service friendly places than this horrible place.  But if you like terrible service and waiting for 15 to 30 minutes for a coffee or roll then I suggest eating here.  You might just be able to waste away your entire morning waiting here."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times. The friendly and adorable front counter man (zach?) is always welcoming and friendly.  Cutie Cole, so happily cleared my dishes. Everyone is always pleasant and helpful. The soufflés are so worth the calories. I don't know who would pay $9 for raumen noodles... But who knows they might be amazing?... 
Thanks Panera."}
{"text":"I generally love Panera, just not this location.  Bagel was stale and burned in the bottom.  I guess I know why it not busy on a Saturday morning..."}
{"text":"I didnt enjoy the service. I go to a Panera by my house that ustu be Paradise Bakery they still have some of the same items. But when I asked the girl at the register she gave me an attitude and said they dont have that item. I was frustrated, but I continued to eat. While the brocoli cheddar soup is really good the bread is not good at all."}
{"text":"Not the best location. Parking is rough. Service is not up to panera par. Not as clean as most. Love the place but other locations more. Plus they cancelled the French onion soup which was one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I love coming here to panera for lunch or dinner. The only reason I gave a 4star, is because once in all my visits has my order been wrong. And it was just my extra bag of their famous chips..."}
{"text":"The place was packed when my husband and I stopped in for a to go order, but we were really impressed with the staff who were pumping orders out quickly with a smile. Customer service sets establishments like this one apart, and it's what earns return customers."}
{"text":"Unprofessional staff. The last few times I been in there about 3 or 4 females joke around and are very disinterested in taking your order.  Last time my experience was waiting for one of them to get off there phone to take may order then line cook replied \"you want a what? How the $&!@ you make dat\". I could write a lot more that was wrong about my experience but it was most all staff related. I don't write reviews normally but my experience was so bad that I felt I should share."}
{"text":"disgusting food, horrible service. 

We asked for our breakfast pastry to be warmed up and were told that there were microwaves in the lobby that we could use ourselves. 

I felt like we were at a dumpy gas station."}
{"text":"I really liked the selection of sweets, coffee and sandwiches.  The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful.  There's plenty of seating and parking available.  I was really disappointed in the limited wifi available.  I noticed plenty of people using their laptops here and thought I'd drop and get some work done.  

The wifi connection said there are 30 min limitations during 11:30 to about 2pm, but the limitations actually occur outside of those hours too, and continue to block your IP after that time is up, so if you need to get a bit of work done while you have a coffee or eat, don't go to Panera.

Coffee isn't exactly freshly brewed, as it sits in the giant coffee thermos' away from the cash counter, and costs over $2.  You pay the price of Starbucks, but in a more casual atmosphere and get limited WiFi.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"I normally love Panera and have actually been here a couple of times since it opened. The other times it was decent, but this time I was very disappointed. I ordered an iced coffee which is self-serve next to the ice tea. I actually had to ask a make sure the coffee wasn't tea because it was so light looking. Tasted extremely watered down. When I mentioned it the staff was extremely unapologetic and did not offer to fix the coffee. So I went back to the counter to order a Chai, explained the situation to the same girl who I had originally ordered from, and had to actually asked to be refunded for the coffee. Very poor customer service!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite location. Every time I come in the service is friendly and so helpful. My cashier kyndra was amazing. She literally made my day. She was so helpful. Thanks for a great experience !!"}
{"text":"This large company has it' shit together.  They infused self-serve high tech computers, to rush your wait time along. I find their ingredients to be fresh They seem to always be re-inventing their menu to cater to what the current eating trend it.  Right now it's healthy. New broth bowls are incredibly flavorful. .  My only suggestions would be more affordable prices. Maybe Mondays could be 2.99 bread bowl special or something.I would be nice to see some vegan bakery items. Lets get into the times!"}
{"text":"I go here right before work for convenience purposes. I would definitely prefer a different location, due to the long wait time, oppressed sour employees and not clean in kitchen area. I will say the one dude who works morning in kitchen area is the only one holding things together. I see the Manager but she doesn't seem to do much, at-least not when I am present. The Manager needs to get a hold of her team, get them in high spirits and really pitch in when they need help. No tolerance for lazy management in any business. There is a certain expectation with this particular food establishment and they are way below the mark. Make sure you look for your order cause they will not call out names."}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't give any sandwhich shop more than 3 stars just because I'm not a big sandwhich eater. However, I frequent this location for catering orders when I have business luncheons. They are always willing to help me with only a few hours notice and the packaging makes it easy to pick up and take the food with me. People always seem to enjoy their food when I bring it. I would definitely recommend them for any catering needs."}
{"text":"Love Panera but this location is very disappointing. Bagel was hard and Cafe Mocha coffee tasted like hot water. Slow service. No wonder this place was not popular even on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery is a great restaurant that serves delicious food! 

What they don't have is an idea of what service means. Today I walked in to buy a box of assorted cookies. I walk up to the dessert counter and Dee (supervisor) was busy talking to her manager, they were at a register clearly very interested in their task. I patiently waited eventually Dee broke away to tell me I order food down the counter, as soon as I asked for an assorted box of of cookies she points out a line at the far end of the counter and says \"she has more cookies over there\". I quickly recognized she did not want to assist me. I said thank you and went and stood in the 6 person line. I was asked by the employee at the salad station If I would like a salad and I declined and thanked her for offering assistance. I then asked who the manager is and she pointed out Dee the original person who did not want to assist me, I replied \"of course she is\" and went about waiting in the line. I get down to being the third person in line and the Dee comes over and asks what type of cookies I would like. I don't know if the salad employee said something to her and that spurred her to offer assistance but it was an insincere attempt to correct a missed opportunity. I said thank you but I will wait for my turn in line for assistance from the employee you directed me to. 

I'm very disappointed that Dee felt that the task interaction with her manager was more important than a paying customer. I'm equally disappointed that upon witnessing the interaction the Manger retreated to the back before her name could be noted or she had to work with a customer. 

Overall today's experience was not Paradise Bakery's best example of their ingredients for success:

\"Our goal at Paradise Bakery & Cafe is that your experience from the presentation to the product quality to the exceptional service is so special, that you tell a friend, \"You have to go to Paradise.\" 

I hope you you receive better service than I did.

{"text":"We have had good and bad customer service experience at this Panera location, but the food is always tasty!"}
{"text":"I haven't had Panera in a while, but the moment I learned about their new broth bowls, I wanted to give one a try.

We stepped into the restaurant last Friday night, took a quick glance at the menu, and decided what we were going to order in less than a minute. We noticed a few kitchen staff walk by, but we waited a good five minutes before someone greeted us at the cash to take our orders. Understaffed, perhaps?

Then we proceeded to look for a table. There were a lot of empty tables, but quite a few of them were dirty and left uncleaned, and the whole dining area looked like it hadn't been vacuumed in a week. Again, we thought maybe they were really understaffed on that particular day...

I decided to try the Lentil Quinoa Bowl with Chicken. Chicken, quinoa, brown rice, lentils, tomato, kale, and spinach, all mixed in a miso soup. It sounded healthy and it looked healthy, but...it did not taste healthy at all. Not until I poured an entire cup of hot water into the extremely salty broth! The saltiness was so overpowering that I did not realize there was a bit of a spicy kick to the soup, which was nice. Considering it cost me about $10, the portion was also smaller than expected (it's just mostly soup). Overall though, I think it is a great recipe, but it was poorly executed.

If and when I visit Panera again, whether at this location or another, I'll definitely stick to their panini, sandwiches, and soup that I know taste good..."}
{"text":"I, for the life of me, cannot understand my friends from the East Coast praising this place!!  The prices are HIGH for very little food.  If I order a turkey sandwich, I'd like more than a single slice of turkey.  I'd also like my order correct...as in, if I order the sandwich without tomato, I'd like it without the tomato.  And when I bring it to your attention, I'd prefer you not take my sandwich in the back, half ass scrape off the tomato and hand it to me.  And would it kill y'all to actually clean the dining room every once and awhile?!"}
{"text":"Great food. The staff is nice and helpful. The wait is a little bit long but the food is great. The menu has something that everyone will like and will accommodate the whole family. It is healthier than general fast food and tastes great."}
{"text":"I normally don't leave reviews, however today is an exception! Just because of how disappointed we were with the level of service at this location on 28th drive and Peoria Ave in Phoenix Az! First & foremost today was the 1st time every trying Panera Bread, we thought we would try something different from our norms, 1st impression with the order taker, I was a little taken back with her attitude despite explaining to her we were first time guests, she didn't seem to care, none the less she rushed us on the order taking! So we felt pressured into ordering something we really didn't know what all was in the food or included. 2nd, it was busy therefore hardly any seating that was clean! So we were forced to eat with half our table full of the previous people's dirty dishes and left overs there, despite 2 employees saw them nobody bothered to remove nor offer to clean our table! 3rd the food took longer than the usual time it takes to receive your food. Fine! We waited. 4th they forgot to bring out my cup of soup so I went and asked if I could get my cup of soup that I wanted to enjoy with my salad, the person who got it for me appeared to be a \"manager/Supervisor\" but had the worst attitude you could ever expect from a restaurant. Now it makes sense why the employees follow the example from! It's a true shame the food was really good, but unfortunately we won't return to this location because of the service. Not to mention it was pricey! Sucks, because it wouldn't have mattered what price we pay for food when the service is amazing along with it, but in this case, it hurt to have paid over $32 for 2 salads and two cups of soups. Hope my review helps others looking to try this place out. Thx!"}
{"text":"How is this place still open? Dont get me wrong, I love Panera, but THIS particular Panera has, without a doubt, the worst customer service and organization EVER. Ive been living nearby for medschool for 2.5years now - in total, I have been in there like 5 times or so of which they have, EACH AND EVERY TIME, either gotten my order wrong or ran out of something spectacularly basic. I had stopped going due to the horrible service for more than a year. Today I decided Id give this location another try - True to form, cashier doesnt even say hello, looks at you like shes bothered to be there and is doing you a favor and then when I order a soup bread-bowl, yup, you guessed it - they are out of breadbowls, at 5:00pm on a Saturday LOL. I give up - I just left. I dont know who the manager for this location is but he/she is the most incompetent boss Ive ever seen - I mean, just look at the sea of horrible reviews here, and still nothing changes - the employees are chit chatting w each other in the side kitchen half the time while maybe 1 or 2 (IF youre lucky) take orders barking at clients w faces like they are about to bite you, sticky tables, they are always out of one thing or another, ugh - Soooo rude, unprofessional and unpleasant - No surprise you just have to look across window to Chipotle - packed! ha ha. Oh well - Love Panera but avoid this location like the plague, their poor service and attitudes can ruin your afternoon. Cheers"}
{"text":"Good food but outdated POS. They can't scan so don't try to use a smart phone to access MyPanera at the cash register!"}
{"text":"This location is always clean and the staff members are great. I have been coming here for years now and despite several staffing changes they are always friendly and consistent. You really can't go wrong with most of the menu items and pastries. The Bacon Turkey Bravo is among my favorites; served on tomato basil bread with a mildly sweet crust. Delicious! They also have great options that are well portioned for kids. My son loves the white macaroni and cheese. If you are crazy about iced tea, the black tea that they brew is probably the best among similar food outlets... it really is just right."}
{"text":"Avoid. I drove 20 miles out of my way several times with the most recent in a Saturday morning. At 9:30 am they were out of almost every type of bagel and 2 of their 3 muffin choices. I love Panera but this location must not have dough to make product or something. After 3 straight disappointing visits in a row I won't be back"}
{"text":"Went in to Panera for a take out dinner. People working were nice. NO COMPLAINTS about service. But the food? Never go here, ever. The Chicken Sorentina was such a horrible combination of tastes and the portion size, well, we should have photographed it. First, the flavor; nicely cooked mini cheese filled pasta. Then, whomever decided to toss three fingernail scrapings of BBQ chicken into an Italian seasoned dish must either hate their customers or must want the customers to hate Panera. Well, it worked. Now to the God-awful BBQ chicken. First of all there were 4 fingernail sized scrapings of chicken in the dish. I HATE BBQ, so that was good, but what a rip-off. And for anyone who eats, BBQ and Italian do NOT MIX. The baguette was nice and crusty, but if you don't want to feel like a chump, eat ANYWHERE ELSE. You even get a fairer deal at McD"}
{"text":"Why do I feel like the staff here is annoyed when we arrive, order and expect food we pay a pretty penny for?  My last visit was much better than it had been previously so I thought this location turned a new leaf. Nope the old leaves were just hiding. The girl who took our order barely spoke and acted like it was painful to interact with humans to get their order. By 6:30 there consistently are no bakery items to be had. Looks like there was a massive highjacking leaving only pans behind. Waited a good 10 minutes for a bowl of soup and Mac and cheese (which cost $16.29 nonetheless). When we arrived home the $8.69 bowl of soup was less than half full. I dumped it into a measuring cup and it said 9oz. Seriously?  $8.69 for 9 oz of broth? Ridiculous!  Doubtful we'll be back. We'll see what the corporate office says."}
{"text":"Ok so Panera is pretty generic and a chain so who needs a review, right?  Well this location does. I love Panera for fast, on the go, convenient eating. This one is convenient to work. They stay super busy at lunch but quality doesn't seem to be a top priority. I always do rapid takeout since I order on the app. 2 out of 3 times, I've been disappointed. A simple grilled cheese burned to half of one side of the bread was black. The sad part is that could not have been missed by the preparer. I could smell the burn when I took it out the bag. Plus they intentionally turned burned side down so I wouldn't see it. On a separate visit, they just decided to replace my romaine lettuce with kale on the Fuji Apple salad. So spring mix and kale. Would have been nice to call and let me know you are out of romaine, I'm not a kale fan. Portions are always a bit short as well. Sadly, no more Panera while I'm in the office. I'm done giving this place a chance."}
{"text":"Positives:
 - Good location, in the lower part of an office and medical building.  Really convenient if you are downtown working, doing errands or visiting a doctor in the building.
 - There is some free parking in the back (but see also Negatives)
 - Lots of comfortable seating inside, but also enough people ordering for takeout that you can get a table pretty easily.
 - Variety (usually) of sandwiches, soup, pasta and salads, also a nice big bakery assortment and good coffee.  The soup is good.  Many of the choices are also pretty healthy, and even the un-healthy food at Panera is better than stuffing yourself with, say, giant greasy grilled cheese at the place across the street. 
 - It stays open fairly late for a chain restaurant in this area of town (9-ish). 

Negatives:
 - It's a chain, in an area that has a lot of non-chain options.
 - This is a Panera issue generally and not with the specific location, but it's really annoying how the menu changes radically every season.  You get to like something and it totally disappears from the menu and is replaced by something you're not too keen on.  Recently I swore off going there for several months after they ditched the pork sandwich I liked in favor of offering three flatbread sandwiches that were all chicken.  I don't love chicken that much that I want to have an all-chicken menu, thanks.
 - As other have mentioned, the wait staff and the food prep are really spotty and it seems like the manager needs to step in a lot to tell people how to make basic stuff that shouldn't require special instructions.  On several occasions I've ordered a particular side (potato chips or bread) and gotten the wrong one, or else they were out of bread and decided to just throw the chips in.  They also are not good at calling or beeping you when your order is ready, you need to hover around the counter or your food will sit up there long enough to get cold.
 - The \"free parking\" lot is often all parked up, which isn't surprising as it's not totally dedicated to Panera, so several times I had to use street parking and feed the meter.  (Walking or biking was not an option since my lunch companion was disabled so we had to drive. )

I'm still giving it three stars because I've eaten in worse places, and worse Panera bread locations, but it doesn't get me that excited."}
{"text":"After the sandwich I ordered had just a single slice of turkey on it, I showed it to the line manager who indicated that she was willing to put alittle \"extra turkey\". The extra turkey came with a little extra attitude that I could have done without. 

I know that this restuarant thrives on portion control so it can keep prices down, but ... come on now!"}
{"text":"Lifeless looking unfriendly staff! You have to get down on your knees to use the microwave! Poorly thought out plan for a restaurant. Lousy food. My egg and turkey breakfast came with two measly pieces of turkey the size of a large marble. Want to go to Panera's go to the Arrowhead one, it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place has good iced tea and that's about it.  The service is just rude and nasty.  The place is dirty (when is the last time they wiped down the tables?!).  Expensive for what you get here.  Good news is you can have an iced tea and a pastry along with free wi-fi.  Fine for a quick lunch break but really there are better places to go.  Perhaps if their employees ever smiled or said Please or Thank You it would have gotten another star."}
{"text":"Came to the mall with my bf today and he decided to get the alfredo tortellini  and obviously when is a pasta with alfredo it means it HAS sauce right ?  well his tortellinis were DRY as they could be he went to the counter to ask for more sauce and he was told that it was already prepared . 
Well I can't even say the name of the person who told me this because she was not wearing a uniform of a name tag.. would give this place a 0 star rating but sadly I can't do that, Ain't coming to this Panera Bread anymore ."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Panera but I stop by a few times a year for their orange scones (their bakery is better than the rest of the menu imo.) On this occasion I hadn't had breakfast so I also ordered the Breakfast Power Sandwich with egg white, avocado and spinach.  Every time I give this place another try I'm reminded why I rarely frequent it.  The sandwich arrived looking pretty good, then I opened it up to find about a tablespoon of avocado in 3 small clumps on one side of the sandwich.  The tomato was completely mush.  I gave them 3 stars instead of 2 since I asked for more avocado and they gave it to me (somewhat begrudgingly.) But again it was in tiny pieces that fell out as soon a I bit into it.  Why not a few slices of avocado like in their photos??"}
{"text":"Tired of this now ! They never get my order right. Missed cream cheese once. Asked for my bagel to be toasted and they don't do it ! 
Is this how you guys manage your stores ?"}
{"text":"Very fast service in the drive thru.  You can also call in. And their portions are just right. I go for the Asian chicken salad. With extra dressing of course. Workers are nice and get the order right and done quickly. A must go to place ."}
{"text":"Food tasted good but was cold. Complained to management and was told where to find the microwave. First time going and last. Can zap food at home."}
{"text":"Not good. Weird layout inside and grumpy service. My \"Cobb salad\" (which was a chicken walnut sandwich when it came out somehow) would have been unfortunate if I bought it at a gas station. Tomatoes in the Greek salad were gross and the unsweetened tea was very, very sweet. Total downgrade from Paradise Bakery, which wasn't great. And it wasn't that cheap. Even the potato chips were bland. And they don't have blue cheese dressing."}
{"text":"Absolutely great place to eat a great a clean meal! I usually order the Greek salad with oven roasted turkey.  I don't know of any order place I could get this meal. If I forget to prep my food I know I can get a lean  meal here!"}
{"text":"I got the reward card when I first came to the store. I told her that I am not from here but I still register the card anyway. When I visit the store second time they said I have free coffee and gave me free Americano. What a treat!"}
{"text":"I give these guys at this location 5 stars! I had called the catering side of Panera but they needed a minimum of 90 minutes (I didn't have 90 minute's). So I drove to this location and they did it better than I expected! I had to order 10 lunches and pass them out during a business meeting. The manager Aaron Taal had his staff bag them individually and write the names of each order on the bags for me! This made life so easy once I got back to the office! The staff are always friendly and the exceeded my expectations! I was pleasantly surprised and will order again and again at this location!  Thanks again for your help!"}
{"text":"So good and tasty. Fast service and the food is always prepared fresh. Good place for the family and kids or if you want to hangout with friends."}
{"text":"My overall findings on the city of Brecksville: Quaint and cute. To be fair, it was just one exit, and that hardly defines a city...but it was nice. Most everything off this exit was newer construction.

Like most newer developments, the signage sucks. This Panera is wrapped around a plaza that houses Heinen's (a Cleveland area grocery chain), a Japanese Steakhouse, a huge Verizon store, and several other retail outlets. We drove right past the entrance. As luck would have it, I was happy that we missed the entrance because we had to continue driving and eventually turn around at this Brecksville Nature Trail area. It looked like a pretty cool place to take your dog for a walk or to go for a run. Will I ever actually return to do either of these things? Unlikely...but let's be honest, I have done a lot weirder things before. It would be a nice little combination of events: A dog walk at a new trail + Panera Bread afterwards.

Date visited: Sunday, February 26
TIme of day: 5ish
Items ordered: Me: Unsweet tea Bob: coffee, black Deb: coffee, hazelnut

This Panera is sandwich in the middle of a strip mall. As we pulled up, I thought it was going to be a small store. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was much larger inside than it appeared to be on the outside.

Random Notes:
- My mom loves the cinnamon cruch bagels. She wanted me to get her one for the morning...sadly, they were sold out. I have noticed this phenomenom several times. If you have a particular bagel fav at Panera, better get their early.
- Brecksville Nature Center...stop by for a stroll next time you are in town.
- Neat patio area. It wasn't warm enough to sit outside, obviously, but this Panera has a cool patio area. It overlooks the woods."}
{"text":"I normally LOVE Panera. I always stick with my usual - half Italian combo sandwich and half Caesar salad. This time, the bottom of my roll was half covered in caked on flour. Like it wasn't cooked all the way or something. How can I trust this place when they can't get their core product (bread) down."}
{"text":"We spent about 10 minutes ordering at the self-register, ordering food for all the extended family we have visiting while at the hospital. 
To our surprise, the register was not accepting the credit card at check out. We asked the cashier about it, and was told that 'sometimes they don't work', and that we can try another card to see if it goes through. 
We tried 3 different cards multiple times, and the machine would not recognize them. Then we tried to buy a gift card at the cashier, so we could just input that number. 
At this point, Jennifer the manager comes out to see what is happening. She tells us that the gift card would not work either, and that she would need to take the entire order all over again if we wanted our food. 
I asked her what the problem was with the kiosk and she said it occasionally doesn't work. So I told her that we'd just spent ten minutes messing with it, and that she should consider turning it off, or putting up a sign that it isn't working. She scoffed at me, and said that it does work sometimes, so why would she do that??
So we go through putting in all the various custom orders with Jennifer, and our credit card is declined. We try another card, and it gets declined.  Third card goes through and we call the bank to ask why card declined. They shut them off due to 'suspicious activity' at Panera Bread...
So I explained all this to the manager after the fact, and her only response is - \"what do you expect me to do about it?\"  
I've come to expect more from these restaurants, and can't believe how careless and unconcerned the management is at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great location! the fresh baked pastries are always delicious and warm. the portions are  great too - but don't be fooled, you definitely pay for it. 

the ingredients are always fresh and i've never had a problem with quality. it can get realllly expensive for a \"quick lunch\"  though"}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday evening. There were lots of staff and not very many customers. Despite the fact that there was no line up and several employees were behind the counter, it did not seem like I was a priority. I just walked right out and do not plan on returning."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. If I was able give zero stars I would! Customer service is terrible three times I came here. Last time I came in I arrived 10 minutes before they closed and they refused to take my serviced and questioned what I wanted!! This place sucks along with their workers. Won't come here again until they hire new employees who can really represent this amazing place the right way."}
{"text":"It's sad that since Panera has become so popular that it has gotten more expensive and less reliable.  We went recently for an early dinner (4:30-5ish) at this particular Panera location.  As we were early, there wasn't anyone in line when we ordered.  Which is why our hastily thrown together order was completely unnecessary!  Especially my son's PB&J.  A MONKEY WITH A MACHETE could have thrown it together better than this place!"}
{"text":"Panera is a great place for a lunch or breakfast. I love their soups when they pour  them into a bun bowl."}
{"text":"So good. I always love Panera anywhere I go. Everything seems fresh and perfect portions for me. I always stop here to get either a baked goods or a delightful coffee drink"}
{"text":"I usually avoid going to Panera at the peak of lunch rush because it's a nightmarish experience (similar to all other popular fast food restaurants) but off hours it's pleasant enough and staff seem courteous and thoughtful, even though they're probably making barely above minimum wage.  The Brecksville Panera is nicely done and has nice sitting area around a gas fireplace which is especially nice during the winter. Customers also are more upscale and less rude."}
{"text":"Panera bread is such a cute place to have a cute little date or a nice place the study, although since this location is the closet location to where I am, it was upsetting to hear that the soup and the breads for the bread bowls were gone. I believe if you have successful business you should have enough supplies for all your customers. My friend and I travelled from Durham to try it. The food was good but the fact that the bread bowls weren't available and the soup that was requested was not available but yet on the menu was disappointing. 

Although the food is delicious, the chipotle chicken panini was amazing. I definitely recommend this if you don't mind the spice. 

Now the staff, the cashier that was helping us spoke really quiet which made it very difficult to understand anything she said. Other then that it was good from my experience there, I'd definitely recommend coming here to anyone looking for good soup and freshly baked bread."}
{"text":"Ordered catering for a wedding and they forgot my order! Went a couple of days before, printed out a list of the food we would need the day of and paid in full. We got a written confirmation of the date, time, and location for delivery plus reviewed the contact information. Come the day of, we waited for a call for delivery but as that time passed, we called Panera and spoke to the manager. They found our order but forgot to make it! They promised delivery 2 hours from that time, but as the wedding ceremony was after lunch, we declined. Took a bit of hemming and hawing before they agreed to refund us. They ended up offering us one free sandwich for messing up our wedding lunch (we ordered 17 sandwiches) when we came back to Panera for the refund. Seriously, 1 sandwich as compensation and we have to go back in person?"}
{"text":"This place sucks when they r busy... they gave me the wrong sandwich and replaced it with another wrong sandwich. .wtf.  too much confusion behind counter"}
{"text":"The worst experience ever stake meet was so chewy that I could not even bite in. The other sandwich was probably pulled out of the freezer with the raw meet still inside it. The only one positive, that the manager refunded the money."}
{"text":"Wanted some pastries and to see that they were covered in flies/nats  I brought it to the attention of the manager Stacy and she said there was nothing she could do about it.  Notice the pics with the flies!"}
{"text":"It is really dirty at this location. Bathrooms are never clean. The floor always has some trash on it and employees walk right by trash and can't be bothered to pick it up.  The location is convenient but I am gonna drive a little farther to a different Panera. I am giving up on this location."}
{"text":"Pretty poor service compared to other Panera's I have been to. Staff is friendly enough but not enough workers at peak times and they don't spread out their registers so people bunch up. Also struggle to keep up with popular items. Just so so. I'll go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"I come in about twice a week because of the convenient location. They seem to always be tight on supply on bagels and soufflés even though there's hardly anyone ever in here. I order an iced chai almost every time and half of the time they come out with it hot. Bagels are as good as always but it seems like every employees first day."}
{"text":"I love this Panera! I work in the mall and I order off my phone when I go on break, and as soon as I get there my bag is waiting."}
{"text":"Both times I went they were out of bread. One time the panini, the other the baguette for soup, and they only told me after I sat down and was waiting for my food. They should tell us before ordering."}
{"text":"I sat here for a good four hours to get some writing done and I observed a consistently friendly and attentive wait staff.  This is why I enjoy working at Panera in whatever city I'm at!"}
{"text":"While it is a chain, the combination of bakery and cafe really works. This location is comfortable, with plenty of nooks and crannies to settle down in. Nice covered porch outside, too. The location is a bit awkward and can be somewhat frustrating to get out of during busy times, but there is always plenty of parking and the traffic isn't too bad most of the time."}
{"text":"Nice decor

New therefore not too busy

Staff are untrained 

Not all sandwiches available.. don't make asiago turkey sandwich which is my favorite Panera sandwich 

Overall their half soup and half sandwich lunch combo is excellent"}
{"text":"Great staff, terrible sandwich... I did make the whole sandwich into a decent half of a sandwich... Not enough turkey.... It's a sandwich it's not that hard"}
{"text":"Panera??
Always love food that are simple and made it into something quite delightful to the taste..that's just me of course, my not be the same for you...haha
But hey the service is great as always!
Will always come back here whenever I'm in the area!!"}
{"text":"Waited over 10 minutes for a toasted bagel. Finally had to ask for it. It was cold and nobody cared or apologized. The excuse was someone was in break.  Won't return for awhile"}
{"text":"I love Panera and there food, but this Panera ranks lowest of the low! Poor service, menu options not available, dirty utensils. I could go on..."}
{"text":"This is hands down the worst Panera! If I could give it 0 stars I would! It's dirty, the service is the WORST!!! the food seems like it was warmed up in a microwave! They never have the soup you want and if you want an ice tea... GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!! Also the wifi is garbage!!!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!! I would give no stars if I could. \"You pick two\" portions are small. They ran out of kale for my kale salad and messed up my order. My friend paid extra for avocado on his salad and got one tiny piece. My husband added chicken to his pasta and it looked and tasted like bland canned chicken. He said the roll was cold and had a weird taste. The cookies that Paradise Bakery gave for free are now $1.50 each. No more deals on cookies. :(  We were extremely disappointed. I thought Panera was going to do a good job but what a waste of money. We are still hungry after all that. We will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Nice Panera.  Clean.  Timely service and kind enough staff.

Food was good as always.  

I didn't come in during a rush hour.  So I'm not sure what this place during hectic hours."}
{"text":"Not a frequent visitor to Paneras. Ordered  the Steak sandwich and ice tea which came up $9.89. The sandwich was about 3\" long and flat.  Very disappointed in the quantity. Leg hungry. It did taste good, but a rip off. At least at Arby's, you leave full.  I'll stay away for now."}
{"text":"I was dragged here because my fiancé loves this place and it was her birthday. Classy right? Well, our first mistake was going during the peak of lunch hour. The line was out the door. But to our surprise, the line moved quickly. Also we had no trouble finding a table. 

After about fifteen minutes we noticed that people that came after us were well into their meals, so we notified the manager. She was very apologetic and we received our food hot and fresh in minutes. She also refunded the full price of our meals and offered free pastries. The food was great and because of wonderful customer service, I'll be dragged back."}
{"text":"Meh.  Cobb salad was a joke - small handful of lettuce, a couple tiny bits of bacon, and a thin slice of egg.  I asked for bleu cheese dressing.  I got Caesar dressing.  We asked for no sauce on sandwich.   It was drowning in sauce.  Super thick bread, thin ingredients.   We got food to go and didn't discover this til we got home.  Of course.

I was disappointed that they don't have any salads without meat.  Helpful cashier told me I could get salad without chicken but since price is the same, I should just get it. Very few sandwich choices - there are several turkey sandwiches that seem identical to each other plus or minus one ingredient.   

Food was ok, but nothing special.  We were not impressed and won't be back."}
{"text":"We used to go to this Paradise Bakery a lot, but haven't been back since they stopped serving blue cheese salad dressing. There's a wonderful blue cheese crumbles salad that came with a weird ranch dressing. I always added red onions, cancelled the ranch, and ordered a side of blue cheese dressing. I don't know why everybody has such a love affair with ranch dressing, or why you would put it on a salad that comes with blue cheese. Anyway, I tried the salad the way it comes with the ranch dressing and won't be ordering it again; such a weird flavor combination.

There also was a wonderful Cuban sandwich that they no longer carry. I find that as soon as I find a sandwich that I like, it's gone from the menu. My review is 3 stars because the food is pretty good, but it's overpriced for what it is, and they stop carrying things frequently. I also find that the kids who work there often have a  \"deer in headlights look\" and are confused by any simple request.

The chicken and rice soup is good, broccoli cheese soup is good, and of course the cookies that come with the meal are very good."}
{"text":"The fall of Panera. . .Day old bread. Incredibly slow wifi. Oh, how Panera has changed.  Nice folks and clean place, but my sandwich was sub-par and the wifi was non-existent."}
{"text":"This is a perfect spot for a quick lunch! They are super fast! And I've always had a great experience. Staff is friendly and attentive. And food always taste fresh. 

I love their French Onion Soup and Turkey Bacon Bravo. Lots of selections of Hot and Cold sandwiches and soups.

Clam Chowder Bread Bowl and Summer Corn Chowder are delicious!! Though I will say, you get more soup if you order the regular bowl, but the bread is also filling. 

They have a bakery also, so if you are into pastries, they have a great selection, even after the morning has come and gone. 

Prices are reasonable, location is good.  I think my one complaint is there isn't a location close enough to my house! 

I'm a big sandwich cafe person, and I will say Panera is in my top 3 places!"}
{"text":"Not at all vegan friendly.  Vegan soup (black bean) is only available THREE days/week. Only vegan bread is the french baguette.  That's about it.  Everything else is pre-made, so I can't order something without cheese or meat."}
{"text":"Consistently good food with seasonal choices available. There is a variety fresh bakery items as well as healthier options. Lunch is busy, but they do a great job keeping the line moving.
The service at lunch is top notch...!"}
{"text":"Worst order online pickup service ever! I came into the restaurant and went over the the order pickup area. When I got there the employees didn't acknowledge me at all and continued to talk amongst themselves. After five minutes of watching the employees chit chat I got tired of it and interrupted their convo. I asked where my order was and they proceeded to point to an order pickup shelf where my order was sitting the whole time! It was so annoying because they weren't even busy. I could've just walked out with my order in 1 minute if someone acknowledged their customers and just told me where my food was. Stop socializing and do your job."}
{"text":"Panera is Panera is Panera which it comes to the food. Not that I'm complaining, I love it and is why I go there so much!

But as far as this Panera goes, the location is great and the staff is friendly. Very large, lots of light, and comfortable.

Parking is a little tricky, but there is a small garage available for Parking behind the Panera on St. Charles."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Average Food and atmosphere, lacking in customer service

I work nearby and occasionally patronize this Panera, most often for breakfast. 
Today I stopped in for lunch.

Food: The food is good. It is on par with Panera's usual output. There was nothing subpar or exceptional about it. I'm not going to go on at length about the taste/quality. If you've had Panera, you know what their food tastes like regardless of location. I chose the 'pick two' option and had a sierra turkey sandwich and french onion soup. 

Atmosphere: Again, average Panera. The dining area was picked up and clean, and even the floors were pretty clean given this is Wisconsin in the winter. Panera in general has a comfy atmosphere, and this location is no exception. 

Service: Here's where I deduct a star. The worker who took my order was very lacking in customer service. When I placed my order, she said to me 'French Baguette?'. Since I'm not a regular, I assumed she meant what type of bread I wanted for my sandwich (the menu states focaccia). When I said I'd like my sandwich on the focaccia, she seemed impatient and replied with 'yeah yeah, french baguette for a side?'. After providing my card for payment, there was no further interaction. no 'here's your receipt' or 'thank you'. In fact, before she even handed me my receipt she was asking the next customer if she could help them. (There was only 1 more customer in line, so not like there was a large line to attend to). What was really concerning is that her nametag said 'Associate Trainer'. Yikes! 
The next issue with service occurred at the pick up counter. I had been handed a buzzer that would be enacted when my order was ready. I stood waiting near the pick up line for my order. While standing there, I was audience to a very interesting conversation by the food preppers behind the counter about how dirty the towels they were using are. Yikes!!!  (It's a good think I know what goes on in most kitchens, or this would have turned my stomach. Still, this conversation shouldn't happen in earshot of customers!)
A paper bag was placed in the window and my buzzer went off. There was no indication of what was in the bag or whose order it was. Yes, I could have assumed it was mine, but how should I know if there isn't another person waiting for a to go order? I had to ask what the order was. Now, when I've stopped in a time or two for breakfast, the order contents are 'called out' so you know what the order is. But that didn't happen here. 

Overall, the food is what I expected from previous experience. The service was, however, lacking from my previous experiences."}
{"text":"I love Panera bread, but not this location.  I have been to this location twice and had bad service both times.  The first time they gave me moldy bread with my meal.  The second time, I ordered a geek sald with chicken and they didn't put chicken on the salad.  The wait time was way to long, and the employees are to busy playing to pay attention to customers.  Panera charges way to much money for the food to not be great.  I've been to other locations in NC and other states with no problems.  This location is the only one that I will not return to.  Management should definitely take a look at what's going on at this store."}
{"text":"Great coffee and cozy atmosphere but the prices are pretty high for soup/salad/sandwiches. The bread and pastries are delicious though!"}
{"text":"Love Panera bread. The quality of service and food is consistent and their flavors of iced teas are delicious. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I like the Mediterrean chicken flatbread. The only thing is, and this is twice in a row, I told them to not put HUMMUS on it.. Since i get diarrhea from it... AND twice they end up putting hummus... I DONT understand how hard it is to get the order done correctly...  (MANAGERS please read this)"}
{"text":"Ordered a half Chicken Caesar Salad....
VERY DISAPPOINTED...My salad had.Lots of lettuce and croutons..But Only had 3 tiny bites of chicken..
Doubt I'll ever go back to Panerai Bread.."}
{"text":"i have been to a few panera bread places and this one seemed par for the course. the employees were all helpful but fairly detached. panera's food is one step up from fast food and it prices its food accordingly. 
they were out of everything bagels. 
place was clean. parking was ok. busy restaurant but not too crowded.
i would probably only go back if i had a gift card (like i did this past time)."}
{"text":"I believe in giving places more than one chance. But I have been to this location at least a half dozen times now...and if anything, it's gotten worse. The food is fine, but the service takes a ridiculously long time, every time. 
 
This particular Panera appears to be chronically (and dangerously) understaffed. Tonight, I went in and ordered a simple salad. I ended up waiting about 20 minutes, even though it was a very slow Monday night. Most of the time, there was only one person working on the line assembling food. My cashier also left abruptly while I was waiting for my receipt, and then informed me that I didn't need one when she finally came back. Um, okay? 

My visit tonight ended, once again, with an apology for the \"long wait.\" I appreciate it, but every visit seems to result in a long wait. This location needs to sort out some serious efficiency issues before I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I went twice at lunchtime.  Only ordered bagels to go but they keep the lines moving and even with 5 or 6 ahead of me the wait is short."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches as with all Paneras/Paradise Bakeries. The only problem that I had with this location is that the app does not support it so ordering was more cumbersome than at other locations."}
{"text":"So disappointed that Paradise Bakery sold out to Panera.  First let's start with the decor. Huh?  Urban chic meets Marshal's big ugly art. And cheap plastic chairs and very few booths.  Not comfortable at all. You won't have many people camping out with their laptops... But that's probably the point.  The ordering computer kiosks are goofy. Really ?   Now the food.  The pick two salad size is REALLY small.  Oh and you don't get a free cookie anymore with a sandwich.  But you are eligible to buy one (stale by the way) cookie for 99 cents.  The loyalty card no longer counts points but will earn you RANDOM discounts.  You can say Bye Bye to my loyalty.  I won't be back.  And I was a regular.  For years.   Oh and The help seemed confused and unsure of their menu."}
{"text":"Excellent food! However, the line/service is so slow... The line at the DMV moves faster. They should look into hiring some child laborers to help speed up the service."}
{"text":"One word, FANTASTIC!  So they took my favorite away, the Cuban.  I thought I'd need therapy, YES, it was that serious!  Then, I discovered the...WAIT FOR IT; this sandwich needs its own theme music, THE CHICKEN CHIPOTLE SANDWICH!  Excuse me; I need a moment - CLAUDE HAVE MERCY!  Don't get me started on the soups! 

You can order online and avoid the lunch lines by picking up your order straight from the alphabetically labeled \"cubby\", brilliant! 

Great food (always tastes fresh), great service, - Panera dot YEAH!"}
{"text":"This location has friendly staff and are in a nice location...close to uptown but far enough away to have a parking lot (albeit a crazy busy one!). 
I like that the calorie count is right on the big reader boards. 

Stop in for your morning cup of tea or a lunch meeting. Great for both!"}
{"text":"Panera Bread is a great spot to grab a quick lunch and this was a great addition to Uptown. It's only a few blocks from my office and my office frequents this place on a regular basis. 

I love the Sierra Turkey but the calorie count makes me opt for the smoked turkey/salads and soups. I always to the U Pick Two--which is a great invention. 

This location is usually busy with people but the staff moves you in/out with ease and even offered me a soup sample--with a line of people and didn't skip a beat on taking the next person's order. 

The place is clean, inexpensive and nice place to pop in for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Stopped for takeout - 2 salads- \"strawberry , chicken , poppy seed\" and caesar. They we so horrible we threw them away. Panera is off my list for now !"}
{"text":"The staff here was very friendly and the sandwich was alright.  Portion sizes were pretty small though for the price and the apple they gave me seemed like it was chewed up by a dog (no joke.  There were brown teeth/gnawing marks on one side of the apple).  If it wasn't for the apple, I probably would've given three stars."}
{"text":"Fast service, great location, good food! 

I love their Italian Cut Combo sandwich. Its absoultely the best! I always get that with a cup of their chicken noodle soup and a cookie. Their chocolate chip cookies are super yummy also.

Its a little bit pricey when you're talking about sandwiches, but its fresh and well worth the price you pay!"}
{"text":"I love Panera Bread, but I have not been satisfy with my experience at the Southpark location. The sandwiches seems  a lot smaller then other Panera's location. There also has been times where they put the wrong stuff on my sandwich. My favorite sandwich is the Italian Cut Combo so I'm very familiar with how its suppose to look and taste like.

Parking is also a pain for this location. Overall... I rather drive a little further down and go to the one on Matthews-Township Rd."}
{"text":"Everything here tastes great and is overall very healthy. Their new menu boards even have their calories for their items posted - extremely helpful if you're on a diet/counting calories!

I love their seasonal Strawberry Poppyseed and Chicken salad [All-natural, antibiotic-free chicken, romaine, fresh strawberries, fresh blueberries, fresh pineapple, Mandarin oranges, pecans & fat-free poppyseed dressing] - the dressing is sweet but not overpowering.

For lunch their You Pick 2 is always great because you get your choice of 1/2 a salad, cup of soup, or 1/2 sandwich - which is great portion sizing for lunch.

The only down side is that their \"breakfast menu\" is only available until 1030a during the week and until 11am on weekends. But their bakery items (bagels and pastries) are available around the clock if you're in desperate need of a breakfast fix."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times over the last year. I have always enjoyed there lunch and the convient rapid pick up option. Sadly, my recent experience there didn't go so well. As I was biting in to my chicken salad sandwich, I noticed a LARGE METAL OBJECT. IT WAS DOWNRIGHT DISGUSTING AND DANGEROUS!!!  NOT SURE WHERE IT CAME FROM OR HOW IT WAS MISSED IN PREPERATION !!!. I was able to get my food refunded of course and the manager was polite about the situation. I will not be dining here anymore!!! . 

See the pics that I posted."}
{"text":"Very dissapointed. I purchased a tiny sandwich and soup for $15. It was bland and the soup was clearly not homemade. The bread is not bakery quality as they would lead you to beleive. The internet does not work and the coffee is not fresh but in steel thermos containers. I emailed the customer service center to express my concerns and they said that it is a family restaurant and that they basically do not want people in there for long time like Starbucks and Second Cup.

It is too bad - if there food was really good and their Internet worked I would go there all the time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have eaten here often, but it seems like it is getting worse and worse every time. The drive thru service is EXTREMELY slow, and 9 times out of 10 they mess up the order. It's always something, whether they make it incorrectly or forget something altogether. The food isn't consistent. Sometimes the salads are a decent size, but other times are about half the size they should be. Sometimes they forget ingredients. More than once, they forgot the chicken - on the chicken salad. Initially excited about having a Panera close by, especially with a drive thru, but quickly losing faith in this place."}
{"text":"The staff is soo friendly. They actually bring the food to your table and take the plates away for you.. something I havent seen at any other branch... I like panera food as a chain.. and this one is no different..."}
{"text":"I love this location, the wifi is fast and easy, all the employees are super friendly and I dont get any problems when I make off the menu requests :)"}
{"text":"The food is bland, like cafeteria food. I couldn't believe how expensive it was. This place needs major improvement. No where to sit, the place is full of laptop Starbucks types taking up all the seats."}
{"text":"foreign object in bread slice! yuck!!! you'd think the person making my sandwich would have seen it.  it was over a half inch long piece of plastic."}
{"text":"Good food, good pastries, good coffee, clean, free Wifi ... what more could you want?"}
{"text":"Panera is usually where my wife and I go when we don't really know what we want, but this one was terrible. To start things off the staff was just kind of rude. Then, my wife wanted tea..there was no sweet tea so she decided to have unsweet. Unfortunately BOTH of the unsweet teas were just about empty. She got half a cup and wasn't able to get more till we were leaving. 

The place was also filthy! There were a ton of open tables, but not one clean table and no one was cleaning tables. We picked the cleanest one and wiped it off ourselves. Also, the floor was littered with trash. On our way out my wife was refilling her tea, since she never got a full cup to start with, and a worker was straightening out the condiments, nodded to herself about a job well done and left. She also left another complete mess as there was sugar spilled all over the place. 

We will not be back."}
{"text":"I ordered a steak and egg breakfast sandwich
It left such a bad taste in my mouth i got only one bite.
The manager was very nice and refunded my money and offered me a pastry .
An hour later and i cant get the taste out of my mouth i wouldnt recomend the food"}
{"text":"I just visited this location today as Panera is one of my favorite places and was really disappointed. The lettuce in my salad was wilted, my bag of chips was actually opened, and I asked for no tomatoes on my sandwich and after suffering an allergic reaction after the first few bites I realized they had put tomato on it then took it off before serving it to me. The bread had tomato remnants on it :/ one unhappy pregnant woman right now. Having to leave work because of this. I definitely expected more from this location."}
{"text":"Placed a catering order online and paid for it the day before I needed to pick it up. Arrived at the time I had indicated I would be there and the line stretched all through the lobby. I asked the manager if I needed to wait in the line for a prepaid order. In a very frustrated manner, she said to me, \"Yes, today you do. We are out of bagels!\" Obviously not happy, I went back to the line. 15 minutes later when I reach the front and told the cashier I had a prepaid order she told me I should not have waited in the line but I could've just walked over to the other counter. I did so at that point, and a very nice but very flustered young woman told me my order was not ready. 10 minutes later she finally had put together the order that I had placed and paid for the day before. The whole experience took 25 minutes, not the five that I had intended it to. I was therefore late not only to deliver breakfast to my office but to meet the group that I had scheduled to meet that morning. I will never order from this Panera again."}
{"text":"This morning, around 5 after 7am, I go up to the drivethru waiting to order. I wait about 5 minutes, no one in line. I talk into the speaker multiple times, with no answer. 

Pissed, but still wanting food, I walk in. There's one girl there putting pastries into the case who refused to acknowledge my presence even though I'm the only person in line, no one else waiting on food. 

The manager on duty finally sees me and says he'll be a minute. 5 minutes later, no one helps me, and the girl is still putting away pastries, refusing to acknowledge my presence. 

I'm never coming back. Come on people, where's the customer service? Or is it just laziness?"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what has happened to Paradise Bakery in recent months but it is disgusting. Last time I went a couple months ago I noticed the portion sizes had shrunk and the quality seemed a little off. I probably would have still given it 2 or 3 stars but I haven't gone back despite the fact I live around the corner since there is so much amazing food in CenPho. I went today since I was starving and thought I would grab some soup real quick. The Chicken Sonomo Stew I got was flavorless and had the consistency of snot.  The peas in the stew were an odd color more gray or brown than green. The potatoes were diced oddly small. There was also an item in my stew that I'm not even sure what it was. It was the color and texture of a carrot but the size and shape of a whole cherry tomato. The dry jack cheddar biscuits were oddly sweet and had odd textures throughout. To top it off they've changed their cups and my tea lid didn't want to fit and I almost left my cup on the counter. I couldn't finish any of my food it was so offputting and I paid $10 for this god forsaken meal. Not eating here ever again."}
{"text":"I don't leave many reviews, unless things are absolutely terrific or terrible 
This place is Terrible! 
All of the tables are disgusting, including mine (see attached photo), and there's trash and used silverware that the employee whom brought my food out didn't offer to clean up (he knew I hadn't eaten yet and this mess wasn't mine!) Way to go Guy!
The seats have big dips or holes, that you completely fall in (definitely worn out!)

I should be enjoying my lunch but instead
 I'm here writing this review.."}
{"text":"The only reason to give this joint 2 stars, is because they serve Pelligino, and the people were friendly. Notice I didn't say efficient. The called in order was all wrong. But, worse was the stale bread, and the baby-sized portions. No wonder it's a healthy alternative. After this place, your appetite leaves. The pickle that came with my sandwich was, no kidding, the size or a 4 year olds index finger. What nerve serving this junk. Save your money and go to Capriotti's ."}
{"text":"Love PB however they're pricey. I eat small portions so it's perfect for me. I love their B-Green Smoothie. Best on the planet. Food is wonderful as well as pastries and breads however as I said very pricey. If you're looking for a healthy snack or even a light meal that's delicious then stop in here because this is the place. Great staff and very clean."}
{"text":"Not for the meat and potatoes kind of guy.   Make sure you have plenty of room left on your credit card and your mortgage is already paid.  And don't expect the portion to be comparable to the price.  You will likely be hungry AND broke when you leave.  Now if you are the skinny nerdy health nut type and dont mind paying $15 for a bowl of bean sprouts, you're gonna LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"No matter where I go, when I get a hankering for a sandwich, I always order the Italian Sub.  as a test run, before I eat anything else there.  Well, this location raised the bar on any Italian Sub ever after.  It looked so good I actually took a picture of it, and it tasted excellent.  It was a bit pricey for my budget, but you get what you pay for.  The bread was freshly baked and rustic, the meats and cheeses of the highest quality, and the toppings crisp and fresh.  I couldn't wish for a better Italian Submarine sandwich.

Panera bread also donates their leftover breads to food pantries, so definitely a good citizen in our community!"}
{"text":"Another disappointing visit. Manager strolls the dining room but doesn't get anyone to clean it..dirty tables, booths and floors at 6:45 pm ..dirty"}
{"text":"I stopped at Panera about 6:20 am to grab a power sandwich.   One glance and I could see the stocking that should have taken place BEFORE opening did not.  There were five people behind the pastry/bagel counter, lots of scrambling and not happy faces.   At one point I heard one of the more senior staff quietly asked the manager, 'can I ask why nothing is stocked?'  Clearly I was not the only one with this impression.

I have noticed this in the past, and I have adjusted my schedule to accommodate.  I try and stop a bit later than the 6 am opening to avoid waiting the extra time it takes for staff to get the food out of bins etc. before they can prepare it.  

What I do not expect is to be treated rudely.  After 4-5 minutes of standing at the register unacknowledged I finally asked if I was at the wrong register.  There were no less than five people behind the counter at this time, and not a single one acknowledged my presence.  The person closest to me, the manager, replied abruptly, while he continued to stock, 'the two girls are filling an order for multiple bagel packs'.  No 'sorry to keep you waiting', or 'someone will be with you a moment'.  Or maybe he could have taken an order himself?  When someone did finally take my order, there was no apology for the wait.

I later called Panera and spoke with the manager Dennis.  He took the opportunity to tell me how many years he has been a manager at Panera, twelve I believe he said.  Apparently if you are employed a long time, that entitles you to be rude and indifferent to customers.  He did offer words of apology; however his voice tone and attitude were not at all apologetic, and clearly it was not genuine.

The food here is decent, but I'm not sure the disorganization, wait time, and poor customer service is worth the bagel."}
{"text":"I went to this location on Sat Oct 18, 2014 for breakfast.   I ordered a  french croissant (Which was oka)y, and a non fat latte. The annoying part is that I had to wait 12 minutes for my latte .  The atmosphere is mediocre at most, they are catering to the tourist crowd."}
{"text":"Unless u want shitty service and flies in ur food I wouldn't suggest going to this place. I went through the drive through around 835 pm about a half hour until closing and I ordered a tomato mozzarella flatbed and tomato soup pick 2 and specifically asked for extra mozzarella (and paid for it!) bc the past few times there's been hardly any. Get home and settled down to eat, and there is a 4th of a piece of mozzarella on the samdwich,  already bitching to myself and saying never again will I waste my time going there I start eating the tomato soup. (Which I've been craving all day mind u) only to find a huge fly in my soup. Are u kidding me???? Is it a coincidence that I make a comment about the sandwich not being up to par in the past and I went through close to closing, or were they Pissed I ordered so close to closing and they had make one more order. Don't waste ur time or money go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Stopped in between 5 and 5:30 PM, and it wasn't crowded, so we went right through.The service was prompt and friendly.We got the lemon chicken orzo soup and a loaf of sourdough bread for takeout, and it was delicious! Especially the soup. So were the chocolate chip cookies."}
{"text":"Incredibly slow drive thru service. I ordered a coffee and a bagel and I was in line for over 10 minutes. I don't understand why it takes so long. They obviously need more employees."}
{"text":"Like the food, a little overpriced. Long lines during lunch hours but go quickly, enough to be the reason for me to choose another place over it."}
{"text":"I love Panera Bread, but this location is way too busy for my tastes. The parking lot is AWFUL. There's rarely any parking and the spaces are too close together. The compact car indicators do nothing to keep huge SUVs from taking up valuable space. If you don't want your car to get dinged, I recommend the Target parking lot and taking the short walk over to Panera. 

It is very rare to walk in this restaurant and see any empty booths. This seems to be a prime location for studying or working on a computer, which is great, but that means there's never enough room for people who actually want to sit down for a bite. I'll tell you my prime secret: the Panera in Indian Trail is MUCH more spacious if you hope to get a table without having to reserve your seat since breakfast. The tables at the Matthews location are also way too close together for comfort. The staff are so busy that it's hard for them to acknowledge problems that go on in the dining area. For example, the last time I visited, there was a girl in the corner with her shoes off and her feet propped all over the booth chair in front of her. We tried to hint to her that this was pretty gross and not something we wanted to see when eating our (admittedly yummy) salads, but she wasn't having it. When having a business meeting or a casual sit-down meal in the future, I will travel down the road to a different location or find another restaurant entirely."}
{"text":"First time I went since it changed to Panera. Maybe it's just me (probably not, after reading other reviews) but I remember it being much better when it was Paradise. I always get the Fuji apple chicken salad and it was ok, but not great like I remember it being. It also seemed more expensive. I can't be sure but I bet they raised their prices when they changed over. I likely won't go back. Bummer. I really liked Paradise."}
{"text":"I just started yelping so I hate to start on such a negative note.  That being said I am however a long time Panera fan.  This Panera is the worse, from the horrendous service to the subpar food.  In general ordering takes forever and they try to push you to use the iPads.  I'm comfortable using technology but their system makes it challenging when you are trying to make modifications.  The iPads will also charge you for some add ons or substitutions that you wouldn't be charged for at the register.  I could be wrong (or maybe it has changed) but there is no way to put in your rewards number or redeem rewards on the iPads.  

We go in on Sunday and it's slow.  They are busiest M-F with local businesses in the area.  My order is quick today but never efficient.  I will admit my order was a PITA...I wanted tuna and cheese on white - that's it.  Not TU-day!  My sandwich came on wheat with lettuce, tomato and onion.  I also got a watermelon feta salad.  I requested no arugula/sub fields greens and it came full of arugula.  Now - I only ordered the salad this way because last time I ordered it they were out of arugula and asked if they could sub the field greens and I actually really liked it this way.  

I can honestly say I can't remember a time I went to this location and our entire order was correct.  They advertise that if you experience an issue they will correct it and offer a complimentary pastry.  Well that never happens.  I never ask either because I just want my order to be correct.  I'm not looking for something free.  

We only continue going to this location because it's close to home and it's one of my daughter's favorite places.  I have been repeatedly annoyed by simply ordering a grilled cheese for my daughter.  I literally tell them to charge me twice $$ for extra cheese because they only put one slice on their kids grilled cheese sandwich.  Really?  That doesn't even count as a sandwich.  Although I think their pricing is fair (in general) they can splurge for 2 slices of cheese!  

My biggest pet peeve at this place is the design.  They have the tiniest drink station and it's right next to the expediting line.  So all the food is coming out and people are trying to collect their food and get drinks all in one small contested area.  They hide the napkins and drink lids under the counter of the drink station.  Every single time I am there someone is asking the expediter for the lids.  My toddler could have come up with a better design.  It was clearly an afterthought.  

Customer service is dreadful.  I have had rude experiences with two of the female managers that expedite the kitchen when simply asking them to correct their mistakes.  There is a very nice young man named Chris that has worked there since the transition from Paradise (I believe).  He is always hustling and asking people if he can help or how things are.  The people at the register are pretty friendly as well.  This place needs new management!  It's a far cry from what Paradise used to be."}
{"text":"My wife ordered for delivery. My account was charged 6 times for a single delivery. They reimbursed 4 of them.  When we called in about it we where told we must prove that it happened. No receipt was delivered with the meal and that is what they want for proof. So we spent $56 for a salad and small sandwich to be delivered. They \"manager\" just said the general manager would be in tomorrow and she can't refund our order. I will NEVER order from this poorly run establishment again."}
{"text":"Service here is verrrryyyy slllloooowww.  Yesterday there were 10 people in line waiting to place their orders and an extremely slow and bored looking cashier taking orders.  I also noticed rotting lemons in the bottom of the soft drink machine.  Today there were 11 people in line, still just one cashier and the lemons from yesterday were still there today. Gross."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a Panera was opening next to my house having gone to them a lot in Colorado when I lived there and also in Oregon.  Unfortunately this one is not even close to as good as other ones I have been too.  I haven't been to one in 2 years, so I don't know if this one is just bad or if Panera in general went downhill.  In all other experiences, they give you a nice size piece of sour dough bread with every order, this one they give you some cheap dinner roll.  Very limited on the types of bread with the sandwiches, wish you could mix and match the sandwich type with the kind of bread you want on it.  Overall the food quality is not anywhere near what I had in the past at Panera Bread.  I keep going back trying to find something I like and finally realized this place just isn't very good."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Stood at the counter as the only one in line to order while 3 staffers just walked around behind the counter taking their sweet time doing nothing to acknowledge me as a customer for 5 minutes. Ordered a Mac and cheese and soup. Waited 20 minutes even though the store was basically empty. Had to stand at the counter to ask someone where my order is because a woman who ordered 15 min after me had her order name called within 5 min. Instead of anyone coming up to the counter where I was standing, they stood around chatting for another 5 minutes. I finally asked what's going on with my order and she grabbed a nearby bag. I had been sitting there the whole time and no one called my order name. She didn't apologize or anything just pushed it towards me without a word and went about her business. I'd recommend going to a different panera bread."}
{"text":"I love to eat sandwich and soups for lunch!  We stopped by here for lunch on a busy Friday.  

I ordered the Mediterranean pita and tomato soup.  It came with a side total was about $8.  Not bad considering I drank water.  

The food was really good but the portion is small.  If you like salads, sandwiches, and soups try this spot.  It's not bad with a variety to choose from.  Just be aware of the pick 2 menu options.. They're small.  

The only complaint was the seating.  It's hard to get a seat during busy lunch hours.  The customer service was great and the people who work here really help you!  One guy helped us find a seat.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Staff was just awful. No greeting and very surly.  Thought just having a bad day but as I look at other reviews seems to be the norm here."}
{"text":"Don't eat at this Panera. Horrible. I just bought what was supposed to be Southwest Chile lime ranch salad. It is not. I would call it randomness with mustard and a 1/2 of a rock hard avocado. The other half of the inedible avocado was in my son's sandwich. This is not my first poor experience at the outlet. Go to Stow or Twinsburg for better service and food. Panera - this store is not up to your usual standards."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! It was apparently an act of God to get a different bread and after the manager was consulted I still didn't get the bread changed. Suck ass sandwich too."}
{"text":"Ordered a bacon turkey bravo with no tomato, did not get bacon or cheese and got a tomato, bravo!  Ordered a bowl of French onion soup, did not get cheese. Grilled cheese sandwich was barely grilled. The tai peanut salad wasn't bad, but the peanut sauce was killed by the other dressing that was on it."}
{"text":"It's open!  I went on opening day and the restaurant did a superb job of handling a big crowd.  Staff was friendly and helpful, the bread was delicious, and the broccoli cheddar soup is still the undisputed champ.  Although the inside is pretty spacious, and the outside lunch tables are great, parking in the complex is limited, so if you're planning a lunch run, you should consider other modes of transportation unless you're prepared to make a long wait for a parking spot."}
{"text":"Believe the reviews! Wow. The customer service is laughable. When I asked an employee about what was in the chicken salad, she replied \"chicken and stuff\". Food was left in the window, name was never called nor was a pager ever given. The chicken salad sandwich (full size mind you) had white bread, piece of lettuce, tomato and about a half scoop of chicken. Wish I would of taken a photo. Do yourself a favor and avoid this restaurant."}
{"text":"Do not use them for catering.  I have spent over $1k in catering with them in the last 6 months and each time it keeps getting worse.  I was ordering the food for my company and Panera was their choice.  This will be my last order from this location.  It took me 45 minutes to place the order (for 15 people) with a giggling girl named Vanessa that kept putting me on hold for some unknown reason.  It was truly painful; about half way through the order I was just going to hang up but with the time I had already invested in the call I just kept going.  Of course when they delivered the order they had forgotten something and offered to refund it.  I told them I had people coming in and I needed it, 50 minutes later it finally arrived.  Overall just awful service."}
{"text":"This location never gets our to go order correct.  And they blame the customer or just shrug it of as a simple mistake.  It maybe a mistake but it is also horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Happy customer here. I'm originally from Florida and have grown up going to paneras all my life it seems. It was awesome finding this one downtown and loved the atmosphere of it. The staff was friendly and greeted with a smile, and I loved that they brought your order to you. I ordered a chai latte and a blueberry scone , and it was delicious . I will definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"I don't really care for the food here.. It just doesn't make sense how anyone can validate that much for a avg at best sandwich.. The soup is pretty decent and I really like the fresh cookies. I just don't understand the mass appeal."}
{"text":"I order the pick two with the BBQ chicken salad and the chicken tortellini Alfredo EVERY TIME. It's so good and they make it perfectly every time. The employees are friendly and prompt. I enjoy coming to this Panera and using their free wifi while I eat my yummy meal."}
{"text":"So I have never been a big fan of Panera, but their new late hours made it super convenient to get a late healthy dinner on the go. I tried hard to give it a chance, testing out different menu items to find something I liked. So one day I tried the chicken fontina panini, and I liked it. It was no Corner Bakery, but it was pretty good. So I decided to come back a couple days later and try it out again. When I opened the to go box for my chicken fontina panini all looked good, until I noticed the meat looked like it had been pre-chewed and thrown into a sandwich. Unfortunately, I had nothing else to eat in my dorm so I tried to eat half. I don't know what was wrong with the meat, and fingers crossed it wasn't actually pre-chewed. But it gave me food poisoning. I tried, Panera. But you've got to do better than that."}
{"text":"This paradise bakery had the worst service I've ever had. I'm a regular at other locations and I've never been so disappointed. There was a complication with my food and the managers were completely rude and even though they gave me a new plate, they never apologized for the problem and they lady had an attitude with me the whole time. I will never return to this location."}
{"text":"I don't know where panera gets off thinking they're worth $15 for one person to eat there. I was so very much disappointed when I saw the new size of the Italian sandwich. It has seriously been down sized by at least 30%...and on top of that? They raised the price. Rofl, panera is good food but most certainly isn't worth the average $23-30 trip for my wife and I to eat. I'd much rather go to a restaurant and have a nice dinner for that kind of money and actually be full by the end of the meal. It's super easy to say I will not be returning there ever again to eat."}
{"text":"We go to this Panera all the time.  We love the food! A little pricey but you get what you pay for. They almost always get your order correct and when they don't, they make it right. I recently had a delivery order where they forgot a sandwich.  I drove to the restaurant and they apologized and gave me an extra sandwich and a bag of chips for having to drive all the way there. The delivery driver also called and apologized. I started out a little annoyed that I had to drive all the way back to the restaurant when I was trying to stay in for the night but they made it worth it and the customer service is top notch!"}
{"text":"I don't know how many time I have to eat here until they get my order correct. I work upstairs and I eat here at least twice a day and I don't think they've ever gotten my order correct. I used to work at a Panera so I'm well aware of the standards and they are far below them. I get the same thing nearly every time, a Greek salad with no olives and a cherry limeade. I've never gotten a Greek salad without olives and today the girl put yogurt in my drink?! I asked her if that was my drink and she hesitated then said yes. I'm bringing my lunch from now on, this location gives Panera a VERY bad name! :("}
{"text":"SLOOOOOOOOOOW

One of the slowest Panera Breads that I have ever been to.  One time I had to wait a over a half hour just to get a sandwich & coffee.  This Panera is also always messing up the orders, make sure you double check your order before leaving this place.  One time I ordered a pick two, & was given two orders of mac & cheese?  They mess up so many orders, that the manager has a large binder with all the mess ups in it!  

Do not recommend the Brunswick location at all!!"}
{"text":"In general Panara bread is a major disappointment.... Their food is flavorless.... Which would be ok if their bread was good, but it is mediocre..... I tried to get a sauce to add flavor to my boring sandwich and the employee offered me the pesto.... It was watered down and had zero taste.... I spent almost 10 dollars on a breakfast sandwich and a caramel latte that was also so bad I threw away!!! I never throw my lattes away.... This was my second time ever being there.... I gave you another chance, but no more.."}
{"text":"Waited 17 minutes for a cup of iced coffee.  Should have asked for my money back when they handed me a beeper.  I've never been in a Panera that handed you a pager and made you wait for a drink.  First and last time at this one."}
{"text":"The slowest panera bread ever. If they would stop talking maybe they would start paying attention"}
{"text":"I put in a phone order for 4 salads to go around 11:35 AM and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes.  I arrived on time but it was not ready.  The store was not busy at my arrival but after about 20 minutes of waiting they were busy.  I  reminded them I was still waiting and was told they were working on it now.  I should have not called in because I saw many people just come and go in line with to go orders.  After waiting almost 30 minutes I was told to pay up front near cookies area.  I noticed \"flies\" all over the cookies.  The salads were good but never going to call in again and don't buy the pastries that are sitting out.  YUCK!"}
{"text":"First time here. Came in with my partner. Staff was friendly enough, but not entirely helpful when it came to the menu. Partner approached counter to order for us and was confused about the pick 2 option (he thought the three options denoted the sizes of small, medium, and large, and was thrown off by the fact that pick 2 was cheaper than a half sandwich and misread the sign), but no one wanted to answer his question. To echo someone else's review on this page, they just sort of stared at him. 

Still confused, and wanting to be able to share with me and eat now because we were starving, he ended up getting a full sized steak and cheese panini. That was a mistake. It was basically bread. $9 for bread with almost nothing inside it. The meat inside was reduced to a teeny, thin slice in each half of the sandwich. It was so tiny it barely covered half of a half sandwich. My stomach cried; why not cover the whole bread? Is there a meat shortage? If I could describe its thickness, I would say it was maybe the thickness of a house key or two? I was just flabbergasted that for a $9ish sandwich, they were so stingy on the meat. It was a nearly empty, lonely set of bread slices. The skinny slab of meat did taste fine, but we left hungry and unsatisfied. 

I forgot to mention-- they pushed a buy one, get one free cookie deal on him, but failed to mention that the meal already comes with a cookie. I know that is a given to people who've already gone to Paradise, but we didn't know? Well, for all those who love cookies, you might still be able to take advantage of the deal if it's still going on.

I do want to add-- there was a man there who I had separately ordered a smoothie from, and he was very nice and helpful. He took my order and brought the smoothie directly to me. The smoothie was tasty and helped me refocus on my work.

Anyway, I wonder if my feelings would be different if a different sandwich was chosen. If I ever return again, we will see."}
{"text":"Been here before and seems to struggle when busy! Not sure if it was just me but I work in customer service and not one worker was friendly or nice to even say hi! I ordered to go and picked up and the girl in the window was shouting random stuff not related to work and talking about fixing her hair. Ordered the chipotle chicken avocado sandwhich, when I got home to eat it I found the chx mix (the middle of the sandwhich) was on one half of the panini bread and there was 1-2 small avocado slices, now call me crazy but only half of that (already small) panini is good with food in between the bread! Don't get me wrong, what was inside was delicious, just not enough inside to make it a propped sandwhich, my guess due to it being a busy lunch time rush, about 11:0-11:30 am today."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. We went to just grab a quick yummy lunch and it was neither quick or yummy. We got our soup first and it was cold. We waited... And waited.... And waited.... And waited for our sandwiches and after 20 minutes the table clearer (Mark) asked us if we needed anything, we explained our wait and he was on top of it. Not even 5 minutes later he came back with our food, and even a whole sandwich instead of a half ( which is what we ordered) he offered free cookies as well. 

We were overall disappointed in our experience and won't be back. We do however want to give credit to Mark. For just being a table clearer, he deserves more credit than what he is given. We even left him a tip."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken and avacado sandwich a few weeks ago, and got a smear of avacado and a small pc. of chicken or maybe it was ..turkey, nevertheless it certainly did not warrant 
even being called a sandwich!  For the pric  
that you charge for your sandwiches, be a little more generous with your fillings!

My son usually gives me a gift card for Paneras up to $100.00.  I think I am going to
discourage him from getting anymore, and take the business else ware.

Having given constructive criticism, I will say that the Panera in our area is clean and young
women courteous in taking your order. 
Cordially,

{"text":"I have been to this Panera a few times now and they seem to be inconsistent. First time rapid pick up was perfect and ready promptly. Second time, the order was correct but it took at least 5 minutes past my pick up time for me to get my food. Yesterday, I went for my rapid pickup and waited 10 minutes past my pick up time. I was really looking forward to my Southwest Chile Lime Ranch Salad but it was missing the chips. That's like one of the best parts! My dressing seemed bland. I've had the salad before but yesterday it was just lacking flavor. Maybe they were just swamped but I was disappointed. Maybe I need to try a different location again."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Staff is rude, does not even acknowledge that you are there. Seems like they all hate everything. I work in the food industry and I know that you can have bad days but this is every time I go to this one. Unfortunately it's the closest one to me but I'm thinking maybe I'll make the longer trek next time because it's just getting very annoying. I used to work at a panera and I can tell you that the way this place is run is not up to par. The managers need to step up. Don't waste your time or energy,  pick a different panera."}
{"text":"I am sad to say 1 star is as low as Yelp will let me give. I don't even understand how this place and Panera in general are even open. Their customer service is a rag-tag bunch of high school kids who can hardly talk to themselves in the mirror, let alone actual people. Panera Bread's food items are just slightly healthier than McDonald's. Everything but the bread is pre-packed, processed  and literally consists of sloppily slapping a sandwich together or microwaving something. BUT THEY STILL FUCK IT UP!!! Make sure you check your order twice before you leave the establishment. This is the ideal place for those that enjoy junk food that is dressed up nicely (if not fucked up), and overcharged more than you can comprehend. If I could get away with destroying one building in this whole world and not be charged, it would be this one without any doubt. Do yourself a favor and just go to subway and use free wifi anywhere else in the world."}
{"text":"I had the roast beef with horseradish and California chicken salad in a combo. The sandwich was beyond good and the salad was okay. They have some great looking baked goods too!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Panera, and have been a faithful customer for yearssssssssssssss, but today I am so upset by the service I received and never have I ever experienced bad service from any Panera Restaurant. to my fault I ordered the wrong soup at the kiosk which took the server/delivery girl over the edge she snatched the plate from me rolled her eyes and walked a way at this point I got up to go and retrieve my own food, which she then grabbed it from the counter before I could get it myself pushing it at me. I will NEVER patronize this Panera ever again. You guys might want to get some tips from the Chic-fil-a folks, this person would not be apart of their team!"}
{"text":"I had the single worst meal of my life tonight. I ordered the Thai chicken dumpling broth bowl and it was 100% inedible!!!!! Made entirely of what seemed to be salted (and by salted I mean a whole shaker of salt) beef broth and soy sauce, I had to add three * the liquid with water. the chicken was HARD (what little there was), the vegetables were soggy and brown and the dumplings were dinky and tasteless! my daughters Mac and cheese was also the saltiest Mac n cheese Ever. Let ppl add salt if they want. 

The staff was also rude and slow. 

I know, I know, what did I expect from a sandwich place? You're right. But for 8.50, it better have SOME flavor or redeeming quality. Just awful. Panera, if you can't do it right, don't sell it!"}
{"text":"Had great, friendly service here. Meal was delicious. It's a bright airy space with nice outside seating."}
{"text":"My fiance and I just moved to Vegas and this place was awesome for a quick lunch. The broccoli cheddar soup was amazing and we both got frozen lemonades which we to die for. I highly recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a quick sit down lunch or for a quick pick up!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Needs to go back to being paradise bakery. Kids don't get a drink or cookie with their meals, they give you one slice of meat on your bread, all around pretty bad."}
{"text":"I love Panera, but this location is RUDE!!!!! The assistant manager is the one who waited on us and he was very unpanera like. Not friendly at all and didnt crack a smile once."}
{"text":"This Panera Bread is convenient because its connected to the Bakery Square campus, and a Marriot Springhill Suites next door. Very big and spacious. And yes they have outdoor seating."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this Panera lacks the same as other Panera's, also the line really lacks the creativeness of other Panera's. In particular, 1 worker, Jake B, was very rude and made the entire experience very bad."}
{"text":"I would prefer not to eat here again.  'Too bad it's right next door to my office building, so out of convenience and variety, I probably WILL eat here again.  :-(  I find the food over-priced for being so bland.  The sandwiches are stuffed with massive quantities of over-processed, sliced meat product, and so you can't really taste the rest of the sandwich ingredients.  The cookies are pretty decent, and the service is attentive.  Since I hate the burned taste of coffee, I can't speak to those products, nor to their soups."}
{"text":"I had to give this place 5 stars because I've eaten here or have had coffee here sooooo many times.  I must really like it!   Looking around, it is a favorite for a \"women meeting their friends for lunch\" place.  You do see men in there but not all that many.  It does have a nice meeting room that is closed off for a small group.  They have good coffee that you serve to yourself, so you can have what ever flavors and as many cups as you want.  You go up to a counter to order and the menu includes sandwiches and soups.  The sandwiches are served on Panera's great selections of all kinds of their tasty breads and paninis.  They offer a pastry counter that has a good selection.  This Panera will need to replace their booth seats soon though because from much use, they are losing their bulk and at a couple of the booths, you can sit in a \"hole\" and you will be way to low to eat!!  Still plenty of regular table and chairs though.  Free WiFi too."}
{"text":"One star because you can't review any lower. Attitudes of each and every worker is so horrible. They act like it's inconvenient for them to do anything for you like take your order or cook. Which is part of their job. They ignore almost everyone and refuse to believe they could have misheard you or didn't add something. I would check your order every time and make sure it's even edible."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Food is mediocre compared to other Panera's. Complained multiple times to management and went to higher management and it's still horrible. Employees do not care about their jobs at all. We drive to the one in another plaza even though it's out of the way because this one isn't worth our time or money."}
{"text":"Every time I order the Iced Caramel Latte I get a different variation. Today's was the worst. No caramel drizzle and it was still warm. When I asked if this was correct the lady told me that the \"ice had melted and to go around and get more ice\"...terrible customer service. She was super rude and just walked away."}
{"text":"This place is very large, has lots of seating.  deserves many more employees and customers.  However it seems the lack of both employees and customers has caused a slight drift in food quality.  Granted it's still good, just not as good as one might want it to be.  And I can't say enough about the two or three employees there, they were kind, fast and did well with what they have.  But bad lettuce is bad lettuce and that doesn't get good ratings."}
{"text":"I stopped by today and had a Chicken Avocado BLT. The sandwich was not put together very well and the chicken was ice cold! The pickle and chips that came with it were good. I was just expecting a bit more."}
{"text":"Review for lunch:
For what it is, panera (and particularly this panera) gets 5 stars from me. The wait times are almost nonexistent. The food was worth the price. To me, a lot of what makes a great sandwich great is the bread; and the freshly baked bread I got on my chicken salad sandwich was superb. The chicken salad itself was excellent as well. Ill be coming back for lunch."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why people complain so much about the price? If it's that big of a deal go to McDonald's or make it at home. I don't mind paying the price cause I know I'm getting good quality food. 
Some of the things you must try:
Broccoli cheddar soup
Lemonade- not too sweet, with some tartness to it. Which I love 
Chicken Caesar salad- chicken is organic(huge plus), their dressing is amazing(not heavy & creamy compared to others) 
Fuji apple chicken salad is amazing as well. 
Bagels are also really good, especially the cinnamon crunch 
& 
If you're craving something sweet, my favourite is any of the Danishes"}
{"text":"Elizabeth was the cashier tonight I highly recommend she find an ounce of customer service within herself or find another job. Because her attitude stinks, first time in this location and definitely my last."}
{"text":"They messed up my food again. I am a very simple person but they can't seem to get it. Maybe they need hospitality training too."}
{"text":"No one here I'm waiting waiting. Asked 2times  about order and got deer in head lights look and rudeness for even asking 3:30 no lunch rush 3 people in store yikes .  I'll stick with Boca Panera"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because I do like the food at Panera in general.  This location and the customer service are terrible here, to the point where I won't even bother going anymore.  I work in the area and have given way more chances than I should have for them to try to redeem themselves.  The staff seems as though they have no training in customer service, I even called one day to complain to a manager because I was apparently interrupting a conversation between a cashier and a customer who already paid.  The customer even said, \"Oh, I'm sorry.  You can take care of her\".  The cashier proceeded to say \"It's ok, she can wait\".  Are you kidding me?!  That was a first at any restaurant I'd ever been to.  Another time I went in during the evening, the place was basically empty.  The cashier asked if she could take my order, I told one minute I was deciding.  She walked into the back and didn't come back, I waited for someone to come help me which they didn't so I left.  I don't have too much to say about the parking lot because I would walk there but I know it's hard to get in and get out."}
{"text":"Okay I fell in love with the cinnamon crunch bagel and my family enjoys this treat. Unfortunately a week ago I went in the store around 3 and received pitiful service. The cashier's couldn't decide who would actually work so the debate of who would help me was kinda awkward. Once I placed my order the cashier put on a used plastic glove (gross) I asked her to change and she did and I could say more about the visit but I will skip to the crap I got home with. The hardest bagels, must have been sitting there all day. So unfortunate because needles to say I won't be back. I work to hard for my money only to be served trash. Oh yeah way to ruin my kids favorite snack."}
{"text":"Every time I've been here this place smells like a sewer.

The chicken they put in the salads is quite gross looking. I didn't even bother tasting it. They are always out of the correct bread for sandwiches."}
{"text":"The employees look rushed and unhappy. They never have the fireplace on which supposedly is one of their attractions here. Just about every customer that walks in is looking for a seat close to it...."}
{"text":"Everyone knows Panera, yet they still come. $9.19 for an Italian sandwich that is mostly bread. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Didn't have French onion soup or baguettes. What bread store doesn't have bread? Cashier declared \"WE DONT DO FRENCH ONION\". When I asked what they had instead she stared at me and said nothing."}
{"text":"I miss Paradise Bakery but, that being said, the staff is very friendly. 
The thing that bothers me most... I am there several times a week and the glass doors have not been cleaned for weeks. I wonder how the kitchen is cleaned or how often?"}
{"text":"Not a great value for $12 for a small cup of soup that was lukewarm and a small flatbread with a few pieces of turkey in it! Not much of a taste of either item, there are much better locations in Vaughan with better value and flavor - Fortino's soup bar or Subway sandwich. Very disappointed in the quality of food and price, not planning to return."}
{"text":"Truly the worst Panera Bread you will ever visit. The only thing that is good here are the bagels and baked goods (which I'm pretty sure are the same at every Panera). I have had salads here that every single leaf of lettuce inside was dead/wilted/rotten, One time I was actually given a sandwich that had a hole in the bread....an actual hole as if someone took the middle of the bread out. Bizarre! The only reason this place is still in business is because they have a nice seating area and it is one of the only restaurants available on Pitt's campus. This location also has mice....."}
{"text":"Stopped in to place a to-go order for a soup and sandwich for lunch this past week. 35 minutes later I still didn't have my food. Needless to say I won't return."}
{"text":"I'm sorry I have to write this, because I love Panera's food and I've eaten at their restaurants all across this great country, but I have been to this Panera 5 times, and all 5 times they have screwed up my order, even after I ask them to repeat it back to me. I don't think that this is fluke; for some reason, they just can't get their act together. This location needs new management and new employees. Steer clear."}
{"text":"fav is the Cuban sandwich and French onion soup.. husband fav is well everything.... always gets the broccoli soup with whatever sandwich he orders though!!!"}
{"text":"I used to think this was a great place go. But the last two times I visited here the place was filthy. The counters were dirty, every table I looked at had crumbs on it and the drink  station was dirty too. As I sat in  the booth, it even had dried food on it. The lady taking my order the last time I tried to visit wasn't very friendly as well. I tried to fill my coffee and all 3 carafes were empty  I am feeling Panera has lost their touch over the past few years ."}
{"text":"The alleged \"help\" I received the other day just reinforces my loathing of this bastion of soccer mom heaven.  Now, I'm all for places with over priced salads and tasteless coffee if that's your thing.  The one thing they do well (and should stick to) is bread and most bakery items. The chocolate pastry (which is really  a croissant)  and the asiago cheese breads and bagels  are the only things I keep going back for.

Well God help you if you get Ashley.  If you get her, RUN!  The little air-headed bint had to get her supervisor to cut a demi loaf of asiago bread!  I went 'cause the mother thought it would be a good idea to have asiago bread with spaghetti for a change.  I asked for it to be sliced and good old Ashley looked right at me and said, \"Like in the bread slicer?'

I wanted to reply \"No, with your ass.\" but I refrained.  Her supervisor cut with a knife, something I could have done at home!  

So NOT happy!  Will think twice before going here again!"}
{"text":"Get some ranch dressing in this place as an option instead of that green junk.  The \"clean ingredients\" farce is getting old.  YOU SELL COOKIES AND PASTRIES!  All I want is some ranch on the side..."}
{"text":"We walked into an empty restaurant a little after 6pm. Ordered at the kiosk, went to find a table and were surprised to see so many filthy tables. We cleaned our table, sat down and waited. And waited. We ordered three salads. It looked like out of Goldilocks and The Three Bears. I got the papa bear size, my son got the mama bear size and my poor husband got the baby bear size. All of them were just okay. Not great. I also paid extra for a portion of a non-edible rock-hard avocado on mine. Not happy. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever since they changed to electronic ordering!! I was 5 minutes away and wanted to place an order to go over the phone so I called in, much to my surprise they have a new phone ordering system where I was directed to some call-center who knows where. I was then told I would need a credit card to place an order, understandable if I was ordering lunch from my office or at home but in this case I was in the car driving so I do not have access to my credit card. I was told I would have to place the order in the store, as I arrived there were 20 people in line some trying to figure out how to use the electronic ordering system. I figured it would be easy so I tried, swiped my credit card, and I was told I placed the order incorrectly and was told I would have to place it again. not only was I in a rush at that point I would have to speak to a manager to get the credit from the first order that I placed incorrectly. Then someone tried to explain it to me, i didn't want a lesson, i wanted her to correctly take my order. So they're \"efficient \"electronic ordering system has delayed me getting to work By 30 minutes, I left with the incorrect order so that I did not have to place another order and wait to be refunded. What a headache and what poor customer service. They offered me a complimentary drink for my hassle, I just laughed and left. What I really wanted was my correct order, and the computer/iPad isn't going to do it. Save yourself some time in the morning and stick with good old fashion Starbucks or local places like Rocky River Coffee, where they know that customer service is done face to face and will make a true effort in making your order right."}
{"text":"My favourit coffeshop ever. Warm environment with good food and I love bread bowl soups and cakes and pastries. I also tried pumpkin pie bagle with vanilla cream cheese which was awesome."}
{"text":"Very welcoming atmosphere to bring someone too! The food is a bit pricey and not always worth it but there are good things in the menu. Can't go wrong with all the pastries as well"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service.  Wide variety of foods including soup in breadbowls, various sandwiches, muffins, many varieties of bagels that you can't find elsewhere.  Bakery products are baked fresh every day - never any left-overs.  Prices are reasonable.  There's free wi-fi (although its not as fast as other places) and power outlets located near most tables.  Outdoor seating is available during the summer."}
{"text":"Not a place for people with disabilities!  Staff are not friendly at all ... Over $30 for 2 and the food was just okay.  You have to walk to the back of the restaurant to get water, soft drinks and butter.  Asked staff for help and got what I asked for with a grunt.  I won't return and advise others with physical impairments NOT to go there!"}
{"text":"This review is for service only. Which by the way after bad, really bad service makes the food a little blah!
We order some stuffs totalling $31. Two half salads, half sandwich. Two sodas and kids meal plus a cookie for my daughter. 
The cashier kristen, as her name appears in my receipt has been the worst person i have ever have to deal with, in years. 
Out of it and most important, very rude!! like giving her my order annoyed her to death.  Short in answers as well. I order two drinks but she charged for one only so when i asked her to add a second one. She rolled her eyes at me and slammed the cup in the counter like i was a toddler bothering her.   And I wont even bother to comment about her attitude when i gave her my Panera card to be swipped. The only reason i give it 2 stars is because the runner/busser was amazing and deserves to be recongnized. I dont remember her name, someone called her 'G' or 'B' or something like that. 
Anyway, the food was good but didnt enjoyed it at all.  
I wont be going there anymore. I will have to go to the one on green valley next time"}
{"text":"Food quality was consistent with other Panera locations I have visited around the country.  But what bothered me was this store's lack of attention to cleanliness.  The tables, booths and floors were a mess.  Nobody on the staff was cleaning them.  Perhaps they were short-staffed that evening, but it was awful."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to a new restaurant in my neighborhood. I have been to Panera 2 times now and both times the experience has not been very good. The first thing you see when you walk in the door is a little waist level window on the partition wall looking into the dining room. There is a table in front of the window that a manager has setup as their desk with all the normal things you would see on someone's desk like a coffee cup, papers, pens, a napkin, a printer and a laptop. Its like welcome to my office.

Once you get in line, and there has always been a line, you get a confused person manning the register. Both times the person was friendly but slow and poorly trained. The most frustrating thing is there are like 5 registers, and only 1 is usually being manned but there are people at most of the other registers doing something, but it not waiting on customers - they look confused like they are reading something.

I will say the food was pretty good, so a glimmer of hope exists.

It can only get better. My recommendation is start with the manager that setup his office in the dining room - I suspect that is where the problem originates."}
{"text":"Panera is great. The salads, sandwiches, and soups are wonderful. I really like that you can customize your order by replacing an ingredient or going without it. Makes your order a little healthier. I have cravings for their Mediterranean egg white sandwich. The salad varieties are always creative. The asiago cheese bagel is delicious! I also like their granola parfaits. You really can't go wrong with any of the options there. The service is fast and friendly too. Great place for a U of I student to grab a bite and study at the same time. I had an oatmeal raisin cookie there once and it was perfectly chewy (got it for free). I also like that the MyPanera rewards card gets you rewards like free drinks, pastries, soups, etc. The only thing I don't like about Panera is the calorie count of their foods, but it's nice to splurge every once in a while. I'm so grateful they post their nutrition information online, and in the store."}
{"text":"My experience with both the food and the employees was deplorable. I ordered take out and when I arrived home the lettuce that was placed on my sandwich was rotten (photo posted separately). It was absolutely disgusting. I also specifically asked for no onions and yet there were still onions on the sandwich. The manager, Sean, refused to refund my money without me driving 20 minutes there and 20 minutes back to return the sandwich. The fact that an employee of Panera knowingly placed rotten lettuce on a sandwich is disgusting. Their refusal to fix the problem makes this far worse. I will never go back to this Panera again. I would strongly recommend going to a different Panera."}
{"text":"Staff were really nice and helpful.  It's always packed and a great place to meet.  I always see many laptops and business people, just one of those coffee shops were you can spend your whole day and get a lot done."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is not a bad review about the staff. The staff was very friendly and helpful and joyful.

Here's the problem with this location. They have it set up \"Cafeteria Style\" which is VERY confusing and uncomfortable. At normal St. Louis Bread Company's (I'm from St. Louis which is where Panera started, so I know my Bread Co. lol) you go to the register, order your food and then they call your name. At this location, you go to one side of the counter, a person takes your order on a piece of paper, then you grab your number and your tray and make your way down the cafeteria line and the staff start putting food on your tray if it's ready. Then you make your way to the end and pay for your food.

All-in-all, the service is friendly and fine, but the process needs major improvement. It needs to be simple and easy to order and receive the food."}
{"text":"Place is clean and staff is nice... food is ok I got the steak and baby arugula.. not impressive for the 5.09  1/2 sandwich.. meat had no flavor and it was hard to chew like it was over cooked.. 
My partner had a turkey bacon bravo and she liked everything but the sauce that comes on it. I'd suggest putting it on the side and trying before you allow then to drowned you sandwich in it.. the broccoli and cheese soap is good.. 
This place is in a upper to middle class area so you have a lot of snow birds and tech table hogs who of course take all of the booths and are there for hours with there one cup of coffee.. I wish there was a designated area for people to use there computers.. I'm all for free WiFi but there got to be a limit"}
{"text":"This review is actually for the Panera Bread located on Indian School rd. in Scottsdale.  I cannot find this address listed. I have never written a review before but I am abolutely compelled to write this one.  After about six or seven people warned me that Panera Bread is not the caliber of Paradise Bakery, I decided to try it myself.  Well, they were right. First off, one person is at the register and there are many people in line. I guess not everyone want to order off a kiosk. I ordered two chicken walnut sandwiches to go (thinking it would be like Paradise Bakery)  NOT SO AT ALL.  First off, when you order a full sandwich you really don't want a side of  dinner roll or baguette.  That is what they offered me.  I declined - I asked if I could order one chocolate chip cookie and one oatmeal cookie. They added it to the bill (no more cookies added to the order free of charge).  She then came back and said \"we are out of chocolate chip cookies\" - How does a restaurant run out of cookies?  I took another oatmeal cookie.  I waited approx 15 minutes to get my sandwiches. I finally was able to leave and take them home. There is no way this sandwich comes close to the chicken walnut sandwich from Paradise Bakery.  I actually is about 1/2 to 3/4 in size, bland in taste both the chicken salad and the bread.  I feel very badly that this company took over Paradise Bakery and the service and the quality had gone down so dramatically.  I guess you should listen to your friends. It would have saved me some time and money.  I will tell anyone who wants to go there about my experience.  Please pass this on to the right store.  Thank you."}
{"text":"This location is bigger than the one at Square One, but I cannot review much of my experience at the Square One location since I only got myself a coffee there and left.  However, today I went to dine in at the Heartland one and didn't leave me with a good experience. 

First the line up was just long, it actually took almost 15 minutes until it was my turn to order.  Once I ordered, the lady asked me if it's to-go or for here and I said it was for here.  However, she never gave me one of those number tags, while seeing many people who have found seats had one. I just waited and waited until another 20 minutes have gone and I knew something was wrong since I have not even received my order. So I asked one of staff and they were like \"Oh I am sorry we forgot to give you a number tag.  Please take a seat and your order will be ready asap\" .. 

Another 15 minutes have gone by and I still haven't got my order yet.  I wasn't pleased that  I had to wait over 30 minutes just for 2 sandwiches.  I was ready to leave and go to another place to eat.  While for the food, I don't find anything special about it, as it just a  another sandwich after all, nothing special, nothing fantastic about it and paying for approximately over 20 bucks for lunch here, I could have probably just went to Tim Hortons or Subway. Save your money and time!! 

This will be the final time where I will ever come back to Panera Bread."}
{"text":"Decided to treat myself to breakfast. Stood in line as I watched the cashier look like a deer in headlights trying to finish the transaction in front of me. When she finally got to me, I ordered a steak and egg breakfast sandwich, a bagel, pastry and coffee to go. I had a simple question about what was on the sandwich, which she had to log into the POS to look up because of course, no one seems to actually know their products anymore. I felt uncomfortable watching the line grow behind me, since they didn't have any other registers open, even though there must have been eight people milling about in the back. AFTER I pay, she tells me they are no longer serving breakfast! She could see the look of disbelief on my face and asked if I wanted to speak to the manager, Sean. He walks over and tells me they don't have the grill set up to make the eggs because breakfast ended at 10:30. I look at my phone and it's 10:40 at this point. I had started my order before 10:30. As they rang up my refund, they flipped the breakfast menu over to lunch. Probably would have been a good idea to do that BEFORE you let people order. What an incredibly crappy customer service experience. I will never return to this location again. Wow."}
{"text":"I wish there was one close to my house. I go when I can. The place is clean, friendly staff and good food. But I don't like that they don't have a detailed menu. I ordered a salad and didn't know it had bacon so I had to return it. Desserts are really good."}
{"text":"Mehh... came in at 9pm, one hour before close. Figured it was still early enough to order, guess not. Got plenty of stares and no greeting. 
- Carrot pineapple smoothie tasted like a cinnamon smoothie. 
- Saddest grilled cheese I've ever seen lol and hard as a rock! 
- Tomato soup was ok. 
- Croutons were from the bottom of the bag. Stale and a lot of crumbs. I wanted to feed the birds outside with this lmao. 
The only reason I'll maybe try it again is because it's in my area."}
{"text":"If you want healthy food that tastes good in a place which does not hassle you about taking to long too eat while visiting with friends then this is the place for you.  I love the black bean soup!"}
{"text":"I found a new favorite place to eat, they have a lot of healthy choices and delicious pastries.  I come here for the Power Almond Quinoa Oatmeal, which is awesome.  If you're in the area then check them out."}
{"text":"Managers need to help the staff at lunch time. Horrible service."}
{"text":"I've had bad experiences here a few times now.  I wrote panera bread and haven't heard back.  Bad service all around!!!  Basically, we ordered our food, they ran out of what we wanted, so just decided to make us something else with out telling us.  When we got our food, we asked why they made us that instead of what we ordered---'oh it was the closest to what you wanted'.....hmmmm how about you tell us that before we pay, and how about you give us our money back.  Really, you don't get much for what you pay for at panera.  Its not very good at all."}
{"text":"I love panera.  The food is always fantastic!  I always find something new on the menu that is always delicious and full of flavor.  Their macaroni and cheese is to die for and there is nothing better than the bread bowl with tomato bisque.  The staff is always very friendly.  They always make sure to remind me to use my Panera card and I get a free pastry or soda more often than not.  A manager usually walks around making sure the guests are satisfied and are happy with their food- I love that... going the extra mile is never lost on me."}
{"text":"I went to Panera today around 5pm and it was practically empty but it still took over 30 minutes to order and receive my food. I ordered two sandwiches and one cup of soup. The girl who took my order forgot to add the soup and I left without it. There were three managers working. 2 women and a man. The man was very loud, constantly breathing heavy as if he was overworked, and he kept interrupting his co-workers who were helping customers. One of the female managers walked by me twice and coughed on me....she did not cover her mouth. I was repulsed! The dirty broom and dust pan were next to the food pick-up counter. The cream at the coffee station was empty. I could continue because I left so unhappy! The food is descent but the service is terrible and I don't appreciate people coughing on me. My son is 2 and he covers his mouth. What does that say about a grown woman?"}
{"text":"Franchises have a sorta commercial feel to them, but when it comes to Panera Bread they never disappoint.  Had a business meeting there today. There were alot of people there but we were able to feel comfortable without too much music or other peoples conversations.  Alot if restraunts in this area."}
{"text":"Yo, they deadass have the best mac and cheese you can buy. That white american gets me every time. The staff is always nice and they have really good drinks and juice. love this place"}
{"text":"We used to eat at this location regularly. Had to stop going as recently it has gone downhill. Every table had crumbs, dirt build up on debit card machines, filthy windows, etc. Just makes you not want to back."}
{"text":"Good, solid panera.  Nothing extraordinary, but you know what you're getting."}
{"text":"Coffee is more than Starbucks which is shocking. Multi berry scone was over baked so it was exchanged for cinnamon  scone. There's a bait and switch tactic happening. What baked good is on display is NOT what is pulled and served. So if you see what you want go back and request it specifically from the display. Otherwise it will most likely be smaller or baked much differently!  Coffee was 3 hours old!  I go weekly for an event but wouldn't otherwise patronize. Better choices elsewhere for same money."}
{"text":"We probably order from this location once every 2 weeks. WITHOUT FAIL everytime we order they are out of one item we want to order. Baked potato soup is not available after 7pm ever, it's unreal. And if they realize an ingredient isn't available for your order, they don't call or cancel the order. No, they just don't make it. That happened and it took 20 minutes and a few employees to realize they were out of the bread for the grilled cheese. They apologized & said \"oh, if you want a complimentary dessert - but there isn't much left\". Lol, shocking. I'm so over this location, every single time we order there is an issue or they don't have what we want. They need someone to properly manage their inventory and demand."}
{"text":"Amazing soup&bread plus cute waiters ;) atmosphere is homey and welcoming, along with great service"}
{"text":"I love the variety that comes with Panera. Their bagels are delicious, and their array of cream cheeses is also impressive. The sandwiches and pasta are also pretty good, though I've heard from people who've worked here that most of the soups and other foods are just thrown in the microwave. 
I always get the mac and cheese bread bowl, which I've introduced to other people and they've been forever grateful! 
Also, their selection of salads is wonderful as well. They are delicious, and I love that you can get half sizes of most dishes."}
{"text":"This location is kind of a bummer. I went 30 minutes before closing last week and they already shut down the food line (placed sign/ready-to-purchase desserts in front of the order line). Tonight I went back and they were out of soba noodle bowls. There is something wrong with the management."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. Standard for panera locations. The staff is all young adults and teens who spend more time socializing and hiding to play on their phones than paying attention to customers. The bathrooms are always disgusting and a mess. I have to give 3 stars though because the food has always been good for me."}
{"text":"For the price-point, this is a good option.  They are conveniently located with plenty of parking in the back. The food is always consistent and fast and the place is clean.   They have an array of yummy pastries (try the cinnamon rolls) and their salads are good.  I like how the menu includes the calories for the few days I am watching what I eat.  I typically order the broccoli Cheddar soup with a half of Frontega Chicken Panini - yum!   For a quick and easy meal, this is a good choice.  My main complaints are all the free-loading Wi-Fi people who occupy all the nice booths and the fact I have to bus my own table (and scrape the food off my plate), and for these reasons, I'm giving it 3-stars."}
{"text":"Went to the square one location and the food was horrible!!!! Had the turkey avocado Blt and fongena chicken panini. Both were bad. The chicken was bland and cold, the bread was like dempsters toast bread , The bacon was so small and processed (think ready crisp). Not worth even close to paying $30 with two soups. Save your money and go to Tim Hortons (and I don't even like Tim Hortons)."}
{"text":"Coffee and food is a tad more expensive than other places but you get a lot of bang for your buck. Leather chairs and booths, carpet floors, very friendly servers, free refills on coffee and soda, tasty food, and a mature customer base."}
{"text":"We are currently on an 18 hour drive thanks to our flight being cancelled from Newark to Des Moines, due to weather. We stopped here for lunch today and I asked the man up front for a sandwich with chicken, bacon and cheese.  He told me they had a chipotle chicken and I asked him to please hold the chipotle. He then informed me that this meal came with chips, I asked for a baguette instead and he said yes I could do that.  I opened the bag and noticed there were chips so I asked for a baguette and at this point, he and one of the other girls get in a slight altercation about who messed up.  The man held up the receipt, stating \"See, you were wrong!\" This seemed unprofessional, but the girls working we're quite young, I'm not sure what the issue was with the man. About 5 minutes down the road I took a bite and low and behold, chipotle!! Now I'm not turning around, since we still have 9 hours to drive, but I'm upset, to say the least, with the service I was given today! I won't be going back to that Panora EVER AGAIN. And now I spent $10 and am still hungry."}
{"text":"Twice a week my coworkers and I order lunch from this particular panera bread and this has been the second time we've had an issue. Today I chose to order on my own as my coworkers voted for pizza.  I ordered a chicken noodle soup and a 1/2 steak &a white cheddar panini which I modified adding lettuce, tomato, mayo and red onion along with a chocolate chip cookie. Once I received the order I immediately took a bite of the sandwich and noticed it was dry and very plain. Opened it up and I have a steak and cheese sandwich with a soggy piece of lettuce and a bowl of a creamy white substance. I politely called Panera and explained the situation and was transferred to a manager who claimed he made my sandwich personally and said he put the items in question on there. He insinuated that I was being false, and then placed me on hold for another manager to pick up and say if I want a refund they have to come pick up the food for verification which I explained I was ok with. Very poor customer service, I get that it's a busy location, I did have multiple modifications and I ordered during a lunch rush, but I paid 19$ for my order and I want it how I ordered it. Then to be accused of lying about some onions and a tomato was just the ultimate slap in the face. Meanwhile my coworkers are enjoying Donatos pizza and I'm eating a chocolate chip cookie and a dry baguette!!"}
{"text":"Always been a big fan of Panera - when this one opened up close to my house I was ecstatic.  High quality flavors and always consistent.  The drive through option (I've never seen this at a Panera before this particular location) is pure money.  I was expecting slower than typical morning fast food drive through service, but received just the opposite.  Order was accurate.  Coffee was hot.  Breakfast sandwich was good.

If I could change something, I'd work on the value for the price paid.  $8 for a breakfast sandwich and some caffeine means I won't be returning very often, unfortunately.  The other ~negative comment I'd like to bring up is a lack of dedicated convenient parking.  They sandwiched (pun intended) this restaurant between a McDonalds and a gas station.  Combine this with their drive through lane and the parking options are quite limited.  There are a decent number of spaces across the main drive towards Walmart/Barnes&Noble, etc., but beware walking across traffic.  I went there ~2pm last week and couldn't find a spot."}
{"text":"A Friend & I stopped at this Panera's on Friday at 9:00 for coffee and bagels. We were told they were totally out of bagels, they just had been so busy they ran out completely. We ended up getting a couple of breakfast sandwiches instead. Although about 10 minutes later there were bagels again, we were never offered to wait a few minutes instead of ordering something else. When we talked to the person in charge upon leaving she gave us an excuse that they had to call around other stores to see if they could get some, I think they only make so many so that customers will order the other items at double to triple the price of a bagel."}
{"text":"OMG had a doctor appointment and was mad starving! Went in for a breakfast sandwich & left filled & happy! Fresh meal, friendly staff& clean areas! TOTALLY worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This Paradise Bakery is closest to my home, and therefore I frequent it the most. I would have to say I really enjoy visiting it regularly. You get a chocolate cookie with your sandwich meal, or Pick 2 choice, but you can swap it out for Lemon Zest or Peanut butter in advance. Love the chicken walnut. Love the salads, and new soups. Overall a lot to choose from. Enjoy being able to refill sodas at the fountain. I've never really had a bad experience here, so I have to give it 4 stars - consistently good food, reasonable charges. Good environment."}
{"text":"A bbq chicken flatbread comes with spinach mine had none... We didn't get a buzzer causing us to retrieve cold food :/"}
{"text":"I go to Panera from time to time when I visit a city for work.  Until this trip, Panera has always been good to me at a fair price and a step above the fast food places.  This time, Panera let me down. 

I got the chicken salad sandwich, and there may have been 1.5 ounces. of chicken salad on the bread.  There was so little, I put it all on one half and it still failed to cover that half. 

Next time I am in Madison, I will be sure to pass this place by."}
{"text":"This location has gotten worse and worse. 

Your customer service, especially for the drive through, is awful. On multiple visits I've made, the speaker over the intercom is rude and unwelcoming - one visit all I was greeted with was, \"Go ahead, what do you want?\"

And quality of food is ridiculously sucky! We just ordered take out, two sandwiches with soups. Both my sandwich and my husband's were made horribly - bread not even pressed to actually meet on top of eachother, teeny tiny miniscule portions of the meat and fillings, except for a giant hunk of avocado falling out of my chipotle chicken melt sandwich. Are the workers too lazy, or too poorly trained and managed to make orders right?

Why the heck do we pay for this crap that is haphazardly put together, unsatisfying, all with disgustingly rude customer service.

You've lost our patronage."}
{"text":"I actually only downloaded this app for this purpose. I am so disgusted and amazed. I went in to order my food, the employee taking my order is sticking her fingers IN HER MOUTH - i am still praying she didnt touch my food. So i order even though her fingers are still in contact with her tongue. And i order a blueberry bagel, cookie and drink, what i order every time, she asks me if want it toasted whatever, and says ok thats 1.29.. now im taken aback, i asked for all 3? SHE DIDNT EVEN PAY ATTENTION TO MY WHOLE ORDER, then basically throws my cup at my doesnt look when she grabs my money and misses it, then goes off and basically is dancing by the bagels and asks if i want cream cheese (no) gives it to me anyways, forgets my cookies, gives me a bagel in a bag even though i said it was for here and then hands my my cookie, smiles and walks away, without ever giving me my change and then questions me if i got it, like i was lying. 
Worst employee ever. I would fire her, because i know i would never get away with that behavior. Complete imbecile. 
Im not coming back. This is ridiculous. Especially after reading this mortifying review, disgusting. 
 Was at this location yesterday and had a horrible experience. We were waited on by Fatima or fahtima however that girl spelled her name, she started off just ok not friendly. Then she got a nasty attitude because she didn't understand my simple order.  After we finished ordering she walked over to the other employee Melissa and they stared at me and snickered. Fatima walked away and the other girl Melissa continued to stare at me rolling her eyes coming near me to give me nasty looks like she wanted to do something. I asked her if she has an attitude, she got nasty with me saying \"girl bye\" etc. I told her to get her manager Sheyenne. The manager and her came out laughing like this was all a joke. The manager just looked at me snickering what is the problem,  I told her the problem she defended her employees and did not listen to what I said just finally said I will talk to them and laughed and said \"Have a good day.\" These ppl were so nasty immature disrespectful. The employees and the manager. First time I have had a problem at this place they all need to be fired!"}
{"text":"First time ever at a Panera Bread and I will never be coming back, at least not to this location. Not typically overly critical, but it was almost impossible not to be in this situation. There were at least 6 dirty tables in the restaurant and even after we realized that this place was a \"buss your own table\" establishment, every bussing station was so full that nothing could be set there! There were stacks, 50 plates high with trash overflowing at every station. Every employee appeared they were under 18, one of the youngins even went outside with a large Pepsi, a dinner roll, and his mini iPod speaker for a break in the middle of the busy lunch hour! The 3 iced teas were not brewed the entire hour we were there, and the diet Pepsi was \"out of order\" aka the staff didn't feel like changing out the old box and putting in a new one. If all of this wasn't bad enough, there was a giant wet floor sign right in front of the drink station with a pool of water surrounding it the entire time we were in the restaurant. As more people started to filter in and become rightfully pissed off that the beverage station was sub par, napkins weren't available, and there were no clean tables to sit at, the manager appeared from god knows where and we got to listen to her boss around all of the employees for the next several minutes. If the food here was amazing, at least some of these inconveniences may have been excusable but the food was average at best. If you can tolerate all this, then by all means go for Panera! Otherwise, I'd certainly stay away from this what seemed like a chuck-e-cheese type establishment!"}
{"text":"The service was great although maybe a little distracted.
The Americano I had wasn't very tasty either, and they didn't have many sugar/milk options readily available.
The wifi had a pretty strict limit for a lunch place, and wasn't terribly fast to boot.
That being said the food was made very quickly and the seating was plentiful and varied! The menu is huge and had some very good combo deals, with many soup/salad/sandwich options that greatly appealed to me.
I will probably go back and try another food option to see if I can raise the rating a little."}
{"text":"I always go to this Panera and have a wonderful experience but today I went for lunch and waited almost 15 minutes for my soup....I watched it sit, waiting to be brought to my table for over 10 minutes. Usually satisfied but today was the first time I've had anything to complain about."}
{"text":"I love Panera and I go to college nearby, so I find myself coming here occasionally. Unfortunately, the service is terrible. My order is either wrong or they forget it completely. Moreover, the Mediterranean veggie sandwich I usually get at other Paneras is way smaller in size at this location - totally not worth the $7. If you're hungry, you'd probably be better off going to the chipotle next door."}
{"text":"This is the worst experience I've ever had at this Panera! Carli embarrassed me in front of 7 people in line when my gift card wouldn't go through! It was truly humiliating. I am so sick of bad service when I spend 31$ for two at a place like this."}
{"text":"Ordered two grilled cheese sandwiches. I think they've just quit trying. Dry, cold, colorless, tasteless. I felt sad for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty bad experience, service was good but food was terrible. Usually when I go to Panera bread the food is amazing... however, this time I ordered a steak and egg sandwich.. it was RAW."}
{"text":"Half a sandwich and a cup of soup for $10 and then they still want to charge $2 for a bottle of water???  Little pricey for my tastes. The ham and cheese sandwich was pretty good. At least until I discovered a nice long hair in it. The broccoli and cheese soup was also quite tasty. The place was packed though so in order to sit three at a table we had to beg for chairs. Service was quick and friendly. Might have been a 3 star without the added surprise in the sandwich but at least they didnt charge me extra for it!"}
{"text":"This is a relatively small Panera and has been very busy the times I have visited.  Otherwise like all the other Paneras - it is a good place to get a healthy lunch quickly, if you are willing to spend a bit more than for fastfood."}
{"text":"This is a stanard Panera and the times I have visited it has been significantly less busy than the one down the road in Monroeville.  

Otherwise like all the other Paneras - it is a good place to get a healthy lunch quickly, if you are willing to spend a bit more than for fastfood."}
{"text":"A good Panera that can get crowded at lunchtime.  Has free Wifi.  Has inside and outside seating.  They generally serve you quickly and get the orders right.

Typical Panera fare with a bakery."}
{"text":"Chicken Caesar salad was great. Served in a giant bowl, generous amount of chicken, toppedwith fresh parmesan cheese shavings and a french baguette wedge on the side."}
{"text":"Yesterday had a terrible experience:(  While I appreciate that management apoligized and offered me other food only after I came to counter to say something even tho they saw me throw away sandwhich and sit down dejected, I was on a time crunch so had to leave hungry and unhappy!
       So...to start...they recently changed their menu! The Turkey artichoke sandwgich does not even have artichokes in it. Totally different than it was a year ago. Its a cream cheese artichoke spread, which ended up making me sick. The turkey tasted like chicken and was cold and hard and tough. Nothing like the warm gooey sandwich it used to be. 
      Also...be aware.... the 6.99 any 2 price is only for like 5 sandwiches and a few salads. You have to add an additional dollar for anything else, and then 55 MORE cents to get half the menu. So- before drink, you have already spent almost 10 bucks...when the board says 6.99. Now, back to sandwich....once again, either the cream cheese or the turkey made me sick. About an hour later, still starving, I was out for the count for about 3 hours. Since the only thing I ate was 1/2 of a 1/2 of sandwich from here... the only thing that could have made me sick was the food. Just an FYI!"}
{"text":"I go to this location often because of its convenience, but I honestly dread going to this establishment because of several things. First of all, they are always out of at least one item that I order. Second, their prices are ridiculously expensive for their tiny portion sizes. Lastly, more often than not, my order is wrong or missing something.  Admittedly, they've gotten better at this in the past few months but it still happens way more often than it should. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the quality of their food is actually pretty decent and semi healthy, especially for fast food service."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery is usually just ok, and this is the location we go to the most often because its right down the street from our house. As far as sandwiches go they are pretty average, and nothing too creative. But its a good place to stop by if you have no other choices or are on a limited time schedule to pick up some lunch or something.

They have recently updated all of the menus and only have a few vegetarian options. We usually get the Mediterranean veggie sandwich which is a bunch of veggies with hummus and cheese on a tomato bread. The bread is better than the sandwich itself. We also get the tomato mozzarella panini pretty often too. They usually have one or two vegetarian soups available but we never get them. The cookies are just ok as well. I do happen to like the lemon zester cookie when they have it out. It isn't always available. But as far as cookies go, I've had better.

I do like that Paradise Bakery has a rewards program where if you buy ten sandwiches, drinks, or muffins, you get a free one. It usually takes us awhile to get to ten but its always a nice surprise when we don't have to pay for one of our sandwiches. The sandwiches are moderately priced I guess. I've had cheaper sandwiches and I've had more expensive sandwiches. I also wouldn't come out of my way to get a sandwich here. It usually ends up being a convenience thing."}
{"text":"Panera Bread Tempe Market Place.
 Yesterday I went to Panera Bread in Tempe Market Place I ordered one salad and to my surprised it was a hair in the salad I did told the lady that had brought the food right away and she told the man serving the food. The first thing he asked was what color was the hair? she answered him \"blond\". that was the color of this guy hair. They told me they will change the salad bowl, the woman brought back \"another salad\" to the table, I noticed it has less than the first one,It look  like they just threw the salad on top of the bowl and brought back the rest. So disgusting to say the least.
Will not recommend this place to a friend definitely."}
{"text":"This store opens later than most Panera Breads. The staff was rude. I was the second customer of the day and they were already out of products. They made no apology for their lack of planning and made no offer to remedy their error. I would avoid this location if you can."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the other negative reviews. I've only had good experiences at this Panera location. Their creamy tomato soup is just fabulous, would definitely recommend it. Their bakery offerings are quite sparse compared to other locations, but from what I've tried it has been relatively good. Will definitely be back for brunch in the future."}
{"text":"I have to say, after looking forward to Panera opening in Caste, the place is very disappointing. I have eaten at the place on 3 different occasions and it is the dirtiest Panera that I have ever visited. Last week when I was there, I noticed the broken and leaking ice machine, no straws, the whole drink station not being taken care of and kept clean and neat. Management seems to be absent most of the time. 
There are several other Panera's that are looked after and kept clean and neat in the South Hills that I'd rather go to.
Hopefully, this location will improve with time."}
{"text":"I have been here two times and the service was great as well as the food. Love the fresh salads.  My sons and I will def. go back."}
{"text":"5 stars if drive tru wasn't so slow sitting 5-10 mins defeats the purpose of utilizing it"}
{"text":"hungry for a lite dinner last night so opted for the asagio roast beef sandwich. it's medium rare roast beef (no gristle or those yucky \"stringy\" pieces) topped with your choice of toppings, but what made it so good was the horseradish sauce and the cheesy bread that had a hint of sourdough in it. got it with a pickle and kettle chips and fresh lemonade. they have a new almond chicken salad sandwich on their menu where you can get creamy tomato soup to accompany it. that's my next conquest. all in all, clean place, fresh bread that didn't bust my wallet. while it's certainly not gourmet, i had to give it 5 stars for the simple food put out. try it when you're in the area. lake mead between tenaya and the I-95. ps saw they also are open for b-fast, including roasted coffee and bagel schmears.  ps they also offer wi-fi."}
{"text":"Panera is a students paradise. Cafe style food and comfy booths accumulate to the perfect study zone. The \"you pick two\" combo is great and allows you to choose 2 items (soup, salad or sandwich). The Panera member card is actually worth carrying around in your wallet - sometimes you get a surprise free pastry or coffee.

Recently I did have an unfortunate experience at the Yonge street location. I went with 3 other students and upon completion of our lunches our plates were removed. Shortly after an employee came over and requested we leave immediately due to a \"lunch rush\" - however it wasn't busy. 

Lastly the wifi login only lasts for 30 mins which is basically useless to any university student - but hey - the broccoli cheddar soup is pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"The Panera Bread at store #0774..... IS RACISM,  RACISM,  RACISM. ....Don't  let the  diverse  employees  that works  there  Fool you. .... JERKS. ......"}
{"text":"I think this may be my first 1 star I ever dished out but man Panera Bread is so over hyped I can't believe it. 

I can't for the life of me understand the the price of a soup/sandwich combo - on special might I add - that cost $27. The two meals were a cold half turkey with avocado sandwich and a squash soup, with potato chips with only one water.

I like fresh food and all but this chain is WAY overpriced and their POS system required two entries on multiple occasions. A cookie was charged at 2.79 (basic .50 cent cookie) and then we said it should have been .99 cents and had to go through two separate transactions to get it done.

Go next door to Chipotle instead if you have no other alternatives."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Bring back the old Paradise staff. Very disappointed in this store. Will not be back"}
{"text":"I love the food at Panera. Only thing about this place is the slow service. Staff behind the counter chit-chats with guests and doesn't seem to notice all the people waiting in line. I seem to always wait in line during my hour break and I'm always rushing to eat to make it back to the office. I also ordered a salad with no cheese but for some reason, they always add cheese and I always have to return the food to get the order corrected and wait even longer."}
{"text":"Delivery girl needs to learn some basic etiquette."}
{"text":"Agreed w previous 2 star review! I'm a traveller & eat at many different Panera's ... could this one possibly put less chicken in the Thai chicken salad...pitiful! Flavors are good, but, that ingredient is universal at all Panera's. Guess it's all about the bread products & not protein, no wonder there so many obese people!  If I wasn't in such a hurry, I'd complain to manager."}
{"text":"The first time here I ordered the grill cheese sandwich and it had cheese. Lately it's seems like a thin layer of cheese spread? Lots of bread. Very little cheese, no flavor. How can you screw up a grilled cheese? If they fix this it would be heaven!"}
{"text":"OK, this is a chain, but it's a good choice for food that is predictable and good quality. I go here often and I'm never disappointed. The menu changes a bit daily, I'm always happy to see their Black Bean Soup or the Tomato Soup. Both are yummy choices. Can't go wrong with any of the salads, although you might want to ask for the dressing on the side. I assumed they served the dressing in pre-measured amounts but sometimes there is too much... other times too little; it's better to add it to your own taste. My pet peeve about Panara is the 'table hogs' that seem to be ubiquitous at places with internet. They address this by limiting internet to an hour, but some folks must find their way around this as they hijack a booth and sit there all day with an empty coffee cup on the table and their laptop ablaze. Sometimes others are looking for a place to sit. Ah, well, it's still a nice place for breakfast or lunch

{"text":"Panera in Solon, Ohio:

Paid $8.50 for a Chopped Chicken Cobb with Avocado.  Obviously not inexpensive.  There was plenty of lettuce but no bacon at all and barely any egg or tomato. And while there was more avocado than expected -- based on the skimpiness of other ingredients -- it was mushy and bland.

This is the second time I've gotten a skimpy salad from this Panera.  The last time, I ordered the half-salad/half-sandwich combo; the half-salad was virtually all lettuce, and took three bites to finish.  It looked so ridiculously inadequate in its box that I took photographs of it.  But I never bothered calling or complaining.

This isn't the first time this Panera has disappointed me, but it is the last."}
{"text":"Since a new management company has taken over, the wifi is awful the music is awful and the music is way too loud.  Music in restaurants is supposed to allow for conversation.  Turn the music down.  Panera is not a nightclub"}
{"text":"We just went here yesterday and something seemed a little bit off about the food. My father woke up at 300AM and was throwing up and he still doesn't feel good right now! He believes he had gotten food poisoning and can't get out of bed!! PLEASE BE CAREFUL EATING HERE! They might not have the best sanitation practices!!! Not coming here ever again!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't get it... The last two times I was in this location, the two folks behind the counter ignored me. This wasn't because they were particularly busy, quite the contrary I was the only one at the counter. Also, its not like I snuck up on them, they briefly looked up when I came in. They literally did not say a word to me until I came up and spoke up first. The first time this happened, there was also a manager a few feet away in the kitchen, and she was tapping away on her phone. So one might surmise that this place is badly managed. 

I also freely admit that I think Panera is overrated in general.  Their food is ok, but it is seems overpriced for a place that is basically set up like a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Panera location in Charlotte. I stop here a few times a week on my way home from work. I rarely have issues here with wilted lettuce etc . like I have had at other Panera locations. I had an issue with an order one time, in their defense it was very very busy, and the manager remade the salad free of charge. Good quality and good management here."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, because it is in walking distance from my office. Every time I have gone the salad has been wilted. How you charge someone almost 9 bucks for a salad, and then give them a bunch of brown wilted lettuce is beyond me."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible management. They're really disrespectful and honestly they need to learn manners. The higher management you talk to the worse they get....this place sucks"}
{"text":"Love their half salads without the chicken, substitute extra cheese, pecans and apple chips but was told this past visit I would be charged. Asked to speak with a manager and no questions asked she gave me a whole salad free of charge! That's service! We discussed what I can substitute and what would be an additional charge for my future visits.
Thank you!"}
{"text":"I have given this restaurant several tries and it continues to disappoint. On multiple occasions they have been out of bread. They are a bakery, how do they run out of bread??? Their soups are too salty and the ditched all of the menu items I liked when they were Paradise Bakery."}
{"text":"This pertains to all the Paneras in the Pgh area. When you go to buy a sandwich, they never tell you they have missing ingredients. It's only when you get the sandwich that they tell you they're out of the foccacia, or out of the basil (they never have basil in their frontage chicken panini, but they pretend they're temporarily out of it). In other words, they've changed the ingredients, but they pretend they haven't and are just out of some things. I bought the new chipotle chicken with avocado sandwich. Don't fall for it. The so-called avocado is a few spots of green on your sandwich. You're better off paying more and getting the real deal somewhere else."}
{"text":"They had a computer ordering screen that showed EXACTLY what I wanted on my salad and they STILL messed it up! I had ordered to go so by the time I found out it was too late."}
{"text":"Tuna has a nice taste and I guess that is what Panera is into these days. I recall a time when tuna actually abounded from  my sandwich: spilling on to the plate. 
Now however, my sandwich had at most a teaspoon of tuna on each half of sandwich. I actually had to use a spoon to scrape it off one side in to the other I was in disbelief.
Oh no the price did not go down in fact it's way up about 40%. Yet I get 90% less tuna"}
{"text":"Love Panera.  Always a my go to for half sandwich soup combo and a baked good. 

Not sure why the bad reviews. I want a broccoli cheddar soup now."}
{"text":"Normally I enjoy this place a lot.. this time I was disappointed. To start the bread bowls were about half the size they were supposed to be and tasted a little wierd. The baguettes were not cooked all of the way either. Then the only employees there were younger kids (probably high school age), although they did get our food to us quickly but the whole time we were there they were being obnoxiously loud and goofing around. We could hear inappropriate conversations very clearly in the dining room from the kitchen.. I probably won't return to this location."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Came In after a day of soccer and was pleasantly surprised with our meals. Tried the Cuban Panini. It was great. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I Walked in to order a bagel bag (13 bagel and 2 tubs of cream cheese).  Plain bagels were very pale looking and I asked if they had any other better looking ones.  They told me that was all they had.  I asked if I could pick up the order in 2 hours so they had a chance to make a new batch of plain bagels. (my intent was walking in to get my order and leaving, not returning for a second time).  When I returned in two hours I looked into the bag to find THE SAME PLAIN PALE LOOKING BAGELS!  I ordered from a manager and picked up my order from a manager.  I told the manager that I would not accept these and explained that I returned purposely to receive a new batch.  The manager simply stated \"it must be the dough\".  I picked out other bagels, but was disappointed that they were not interested in quality control for a simple plain bagel!  I went out of my way to return for Panera to get my order and I was still disappointed, with no compensation or discount!  GO SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR BAGELS!!!"}
{"text":"I would give it four or five stars if it weren't for the terrible customer service. Some of the employees are okay, but many of the employees on the registers are unfriendly and cold. Paneras are known for their friendly and welcoming workers, but this location shows otherwise."}
{"text":"Alex needs to learn about customer service ... been ordering from here for years and she has no communication skills or customer service skills. Will not be ordering any more!"}
{"text":"The employees at this location are terrible. I did rapid pickup, an employee brought my bag over to me and I noticed it was light -- missing the grilled cheese. Another employee grabbed it and put it in the bag; when I got back to work and opened it, it was burnt/hard & chewy and made with what looks like American cheese, not gouda that I ordered. Also basically cemented together and was stuck to the container...not sure who checked the bag to make sure everything was in it, but it was also missing the utensils so generally an overall fail...I tweeted about it and their CS team responded and said the manager at this location would be in touch in \"2-3 business days\" but of course I never heard anything."}
{"text":"I have had take out, dined in, and catering from a number of Panera bread locations. Panera food is very consistent across different locations, and this place does not disappoint. What makes this a 5 star Panera is the customer service. While I have not been here during peak lunch hour, I've been to this location multiple times, and the staff has always been helpful and friendly. Who goes out of their way to put salt and pepper packages into a cup to distract a baby so parents can enjoy a quick meal? Staff at this Panera does!"}
{"text":"Something about this Panera bread upsets my stomach.
I've eaten at other Panera breads and felt fine.

I talked with the manager and he rudely brushed me off.

This place makes you sick and then mocks you for it. 
Avoid it at all costs. 

Eat out of the trash cans near by for better food. 
My stomach is churning just thinking about it."}
{"text":"I always walk around the Yonge-Dundas area. After it was first opened, a friend wanted to come here for their soup so I thought, \"Sure why not.\"

I have to say...I was missing out. We tried the Pick 2 option of either a soup, salad, pasta or sandwich. I chose the Roast Turkey, Avocado and BLT Sandwich on Sourdough Bread with a Broccoli Cheddar Soup. It was very delicious! I ate the whole meal in under 5 minutes. 

It did cost about $11 but it was worth every penny. I would definitely go back (with my new Panera membership card)."}
{"text":"Ugh, gross. 

I was excited at first to see this American chain pop up here, since I know it's popular over there and I once had a yummy bear claw pastry from a Panera Bread in Philadelphia. 

But I came to this location for lunch not long ago, and was so incredibly disappointed. I had the 1/2 salad + 1/2 sandwich combo for lunch (I love when they let you do the halfsies thing) but both were so terrible. 

The salad was full of iceberg lettuce and so boring, with a weird-tasting balsamic dressing on top (wasn't asked what dressing I wanted). The sandwich was \"sun-dried tomato bread with grilled vegetables\".. but the bread was untoasted, got soggy from the spread, and the grilled veggies were near-raw, unsalted, and so bad. 

What a disappointment. Don't go here - plenty of other great lunch options on Yonge St."}
{"text":"Used to come here 2-3 times a week and get the buy 2 combo all the time. Please bring the china bowl back, the new bowl is way smaller and the portion is ridiculous smaller as well. Food still good but dont want to spend $11 for half sandwich and \"kid\" size salad. U can see the difference with pics I post."}
{"text":"MeH!!! The good is ok nothing exotic or interesting... their pastries are BOMB!!!! and their hibiscus and mango tea are amaZING! I usually mix them and I love their cookies or cakes or rolls better than their flattbreads, sandwiches or salads. The service can be Great or Awful depending on who's working I go once a wk on my lunch or on my break to grab some cookies and tea. Sometimes, I get better service than at a seat down restaurant and others they make you feel like your invisible, so it all depends that's why I put 3 stars. But if you go try their TEA!"}
{"text":"I asked what a broth bowl was and was told it was a bowl with broth  - not very informative nor descriptive. I ordered Ricotta Sacchettini with Chicken Broth Bowl for takeout and when I got home it was Thai Garden Chicken Wonton Broth bowl. I cannot believe HOW SALTY it was. Inedible.

Add insult to injury I ordered the a triple chocolate cookie. When I went to pick it up they had given the last one away.

Panera - you are slipping. Pay attention!!!"}
{"text":"THIS PANERA IS AWFUL.  They can never get an order right!  EVER!  YOU ARE TERRIBLE!  Three times in a row and when I ask for a refund or at least to take out the chicken, you refuse?  What is wrong with you?!"}
{"text":"Counter service was quick, but the sandwich delivery was a bit slow. Coffee and bagels were excellent and that why I go here. Those cinnamon crunch bagels with honey walnut cream cheese are crack! Yum!"}
{"text":"Over the years I'm kind of starting to not like Panera bread anymore. It would be worth going once in a while but portions are tiny for the price. I feel like the quality of Panera in general keeps going down over the last decade. My last few visits I just kind of didn't care at all for the food and as I said it's not a cheap eat by any means."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery for me, is comfort food. This specific location is across the street from where I work, and because I prefer not to dine where I work, I always venture here while on a break. The food tastes fresh and healthy. I've tried almost every single one of their sandwiches, and although I have small tweaks for each one of them (hold the mayo, I despise tomatoes, the chicken can be slightly chewy) I really appreciate their overall comfort and deliciousness. 
My personal favorite is the California club, the bacon is always crispy and who isn't obsessed with avocado?? Since becoming a vegetarian, I still love this place. One of my absolute favorite comfort foods is their Asian Salad (I now order it without chicken). Actually, they still charge me the full price even though I don't get the chicken which kind of bugs me. When I worked at a sandwich place, protein-less entrees were deducted a dollar. ANYWAY...I think overall, Paradise Bakery is a delicious place to find fresh food, maybe overpriced, but the atmosphere is nice.
Their parking lot kind of sucks though. The rows are narrow and difficult to navigate in an SUV. Small complaint.
Service is usually not bad, but the workers can be unfriendly at times. There is a bald man that works at this location who is particularly kind and I always appreciate his input when I am indecisive with my sandwich choice!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the staff seems to be on autopilot.  Not listening to the requests I made and then charging me even for things I didn't want or ask for.

When I spoke with the manager he didn't seem to care what the actual issue was, only that he cared if I  was going speak badly about his employees.  He even stated \" what you want your dollar back\". With a condescending tone once he sort of heard what my issue was.

On a side note, Betty at soups was very nice and helpful, maybe she should be in charge.  Because of her this is a two star review instead of a one star review..."}
{"text":"My office has ordered several times from this location to have deliveries and I don't believe that there has been a time where they have gotten an order correct yet. 
A simple order of two half sandwiches, a soup and a smoothie is too much for them to get right. They forget one of the sandwiches. The checker has written on the bag that everything is there so unless the driver is having a snack on the way over they aren't checking the order. 
We were thinking about using them for some catering of events, but if they can't get a simple two person order right, what makes me think that they are going to get a 50 person catering job correct?"}
{"text":"Stopped in 3 different mornings this week....Service was much slower than I've come to expect from other Panera locations and most of the coffee was out. 

It's a nice, new location, but won't be able to compete with Starbuck's (across the parking lot) if they don't fix the little things. Too bad there's not a Dunkin Donuts in this new plaza."}
{"text":"Great place overall. Outstanding customer service, never too long of a wait and the food is always fresh. I always get the steak panini with a side of the broccoli cheddar soup and I have never been disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"The last time I went to Panera, was when I was a vegetarian, not a vegan. I'm pretty sure finding a decent sandwich which is vegan would be nearly impossible, seeing as the bread probably uses egg, and the toppings are cheeses, meats, certain spreads which use milk and so on. 

Although; if you eat animal products, I'm sure this would be great for you. I remember I had sandwiches and soups there before, and they were beyond delicious. The sandwiches, depending on what bread you choose, are fluffy, warm, fresh, wow. 

The prices are a bit expensive, I won't lie. They aren't cheap at all, which is annoying, because it's a couple of slices of bread and some deli meat, but the bread is made in house, and wonderful, so you be the judge.

I suggest you try Panera, whether you try the soups, or sandwiches, its up to you, (I know there is a vegetarian soup option though!) but it wont disappoint you!"}
{"text":"I miss Panera. They had the best chocolate hazelnut bagels and good cheap coffee. And  free wifi. A grad student's wet dream."}
{"text":"Often stop by to grab breakfast. Morning staff are friendly but extremely inefficient....15 minutes to make me 2 sandwich wraps and smoothie?"}
{"text":"friendly staff, good food, EXCELLENT soups, especially the onion."}
{"text":"I like Panera, and I like the type of food they serve. But this place is D-I-R-T-Y. From the tables (which do not seem to get cleaned in between customers) to the floors to the coffee station. I noticed a gross-looking spill next to the garbage can and an employee just walked by. I looked at her face to see what she would do. I saw her notice it, then she looked at me and walked on as if everything was normal (and, frankly, I suspect it was, for her)."}
{"text":"After being a fan of Artisano's Bakery-Cafe I decided to try its competitor in Mississauga.  Let me tell you there is no comparison. 

The coffee and latte were okay...nothing I would go out of my way for.  But the bread and pastries were terrible.  I ordered a pecan roll and was so disappointed that it was stale.  Luckily they have a small microwave that I was able to nuke it for a few seconds to liven it up.  I also ordered a grilled cheese sandwich for my daugther...what I got back was grilled toast with the processed cheese still cold. The server even attempted to rationalize that she thought the sandwich was done because the bread was already a little brown.  But she could not argue when I lifted the bread and showed her the cold piece of cheese.  
People come to Panera for the ability to sit and relax a bit, and particularly because it has Wi-fi.  But I have to tell you that I won't be coming here anymore.  This American food chain is not for me."}
{"text":"My friend was waiting for about 10 minutes for his order with no communication as to why.  I went to the counter to order with no other cutomers in line and stood for several minutes without bring helped and watched several employees standing and talking in the area further down and decided to not wait any longer so i left without."}
{"text":"Confusing ordering system, small portion sizes and pricing that is way too high for what you get.   I am so disappointed Panera has gone down the road of being cheap and stingy when it comes to quality and portion sizes. I hope a Kneaders opens up nearby---they have a much better menu selection and way better customer service."}
{"text":"Had great customer service the other night at Panera went there late they were out of most breads and the cashier Jordyn was very knowledgeable of the menu to help me find something else to order."}
{"text":"Best grilled cheese!! Their soups are very delish and hearty too. It can get very packed, so go early!"}
{"text":"What a great experience this morning was. I just wanted a simple cup of coffee. There wasn't anymore iced coffee so I got some hot brewed coffee over ice instead. I mentioned that they were out for future as I went to walk out the door. He stopped me and adjusted my drink to perfection! What a great morning!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a blt sandwich. Service was OK but prompt. Bill was wicked high, especially for the quality of food given. A $6 half sandwich is much too expensive to be dry and bland. I asked for honey mustard, was walked to the yellow mustard and asked how many packets I needed as if there were a limit. Same employee made me reach around her to get a drink lid as she leaned on the counter, only to find out they didnt carry lids for the cup i was given. I also witnessed staff sweeping floors in kitchen around unserved food dishes. Restaurant floor and many tables in eating area were very dirty. There were also a LOT of staff, they seemed in each others way and at a loss for things to do. There were some higher managenent persons with only name tags sitting in the eating area, speaking loudly about business, inappropriate. Will likely not be returning to panera."}
{"text":"I called to order my lunch, the lady put me on 'hold' or mute for 5 minutes... she was kinda sassy but besides that the people there are really nice and the food is excellent. Not too loud or busy after 1 ish"}
{"text":"Not sure what the other people are talking about, this location is amazing and always delicious. That goes for all locations in Ontario. Just delicious. Panera bread is my absolute favourite place to eat, my hubby is from New York and I would always get it there and when I found out Ontario had a couple locations it was the  best day of my life! There are none even close to me and I always take the drive just to get it. I usually get grilled cheese but everything is fantastic here. Someone posted that the Mac and cheese is soupy, that is a straight up LIE. The Mac and cheese is creamy and delicious and I LOVE it! If you like soup and sammies you will love this place. Also they bake their bread and pastries and you can by whole loaves and bagel. Lastly, they make the absolute BEST brownie I have ever had (and I've had a lot). I buy like 10 at a time to last a couple days :):)"}
{"text":"I ordered a catering order for lunch for around 20 people. The delivery person was on time and we received everything that we ordered.

I'm not the right person to actually be reviewing the food since working for Panera Bakery was my first job waaaay back when I was 16. However, everyone was happy with their boxed lunch sandwiches and catering sized Caesar salad. I would not hesitate to order another large catering order from them again."}
{"text":"This location is amazing!!! The food is fresh and delicious, the atmosphere is relaxing (even though it's almost always busy), and the staff are so considerate. They are the epitome of customer service! I was so impressed with my visit yesterday that I came back to speak to the GM, Juan. He was awesome. He took the time to come over to speak to me even though it could have potentially been a complaint. I would also like to thank Thomas and Roxy for making the most delicious frozen lemonade ever!!! ( I went in 2 days straight.) Amy is the best! She answered all my questions about the salads and even suggested that I try the sweetened green tea-yummy :) I highly recommend this Panera location. I live in walking distance to the one in Boca Park. However, the food quality, atmosphere, and friendly staff are well worth the trip. I will definately be back. Thank you again , Juan.

PS: The Greek salad is incredibly delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The only thing that i go to Panera for is their iced chai tea. This is their best item on the menu. If you are looking for a quick trip and think that going through the drive through will help, forget it!Wait time is an estimated 10 minutes, regardless of whether there's 1 car or more in front of you."}
{"text":"There was a beggar in the restaurant which made me have a horrid experience and made me sick. He came up to me and starting asking me for money. Horrible security. How could the cashier not notice a guy with a dirty face and dirty and ripped clothes. Food was good though."}
{"text":"For a place that has a hipster & healthy vibe this place is about as unhealthy as fast food gets.  Food is still good but the sodium level in a half turkey sandwich and chicken noodle soup will blow out a day by itself.

The order kiosks are nice but they are missing some odd options, I could add cucumber to a sandwich but not a salad?  I've also learned to leave off salt & pepper after I had half a shaker of each dumped on my food.  

Other than that parking isn't that bad for the area, the people are nice and tables are clean.  If they made more food fresh instead of trucking it in and upped the quality to something more than heating up a can of progresso I'd go more but as it is you're paying a premium for literally the same thing you could make at home with little effort."}
{"text":"Is it possible to give a -5 star rating? If it were, I would give it to this location! 
This is the worst, worst, worst Panera Bread I have ever been to. 

Why do I continue to go there you may ask... because it is so close to my house, I have limited options as a vegetarian on the go, and apparently I am a glutton for punishment. 

I have spoken with three different managers regarding the issues I've had with my meals, and nothing ever seems to change.

I can finally say that I will not be going back, au revoir!"}
{"text":"We dined in today for lunch and experienced a nice atmosphere and good customer service. I like the variety of salads, soups, sandwiches and deserts offered as well as the vegetarian options. Easy to get in and out and clean."}
{"text":"Pricey but the meal and drink options are quite good.

The chai latte is really awesome and some of their smoothies are wonderful as well.

Both the butternut squash soup and creamy tomato soup taste great. 

Downsides are that it is quite expensive and the wi fi is horrendous. Might be the slowest WiFi in Toronto. Might as well not even have wi fi honestly.

Sometimes can get really crowded. It is much more comfy inside than Starbucks or aroma in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've waited so long for a Panera Bread to come to Arizona- and this location did not disappoint! I don't know why it is getting such bad reviews. I think most Arizonans are just so used to Paradise and they compare these two restaurants, when really there's no comparison! The food at Panera is amazing! I try to judge a restaurant off of how the food tastes- not the people working there. You'll run into bad customer service at many restaurants these days (including Paradise) but as long as the food is good- who cares!  The paninis, mac n cheese, soups, sandwiches- everything on the menu is so tasty! I've never had a bad food (or customer service) experience here. I only wish they would put another one in the East Valley!"}
{"text":"Finally tried Paradise Bakery- and glad! I ordered a turkey avocado sandwich (1/2) with the Mac and cheese and it was delicious and healthy. You get a warm chocolate chip cookie with each meal, and they have bread and cookies available for purchase too. The dining area is clean and seats A LOT of people which is nice. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Non existent internet service.   I came here to do some work on my laptop and the internet speed wasn't strong enough.  :("}
{"text":"They block off the line all the time so  it's impossible to read the menu. But feel free to read the to go menu instead because the huge menu blocked off by red rope is useless. There's never enough staff to make the orders and the cashiers don't know the ingredients to the salads so it takes forever to omit or add anything to your salad or sandwich. I've also witnessed the employees arguing in front of me and other customers which causes the wait to be even longer. They have officially changed a some what personal experience into a sub par fast food experience but you still pay the prices of a restaurant. The employees are semi friendly but the experience is sub par."}
{"text":"0 stars if I could. They messed up our order when ordering online. We went to pick it up and just had to randomly find our order waiting for us because no one was helping us. We got the food home and realized they forgot some of our food and messed up other parts of our order. The food they did include was subpar. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Slowest panera ever. With rude and impatient staff, an attitude that appears to just be a reflection of the managers working."}
{"text":"I went to Panera Bread across from Sheetz on Rte. 19 Perry Hwy. in Wexford on Sunday 11/13/11, and decided to order something different than usual.  I had been getting disenchanted with this place, because when my little daughter ordered the roast beef (kid's meal) the last 2 times, the beef was so gristly that she couldn't even eat it and I had to ask them to exchange it for something else.   I saw a sign stating that there was a new panini \"Pick 2\" combo, which was Turkey Artichoke panini with Mac & Cheese as the side. No price was listed on the sign (CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!).  I should have known better. 

 I ordered this and received it, thinking it would be in the moderate price range as their other \"Pick 2\" specials, which are I believe $6.49 give or take 50 cents.   I looked at the receipt, and I was shocked to find out that I had paid the better part of $9 for this wimpy, thin little panini sandwich and a small little cup of mac & cheese.  It was I believe $8.89.   The amount of turkey on it had to be about 1/2 of a slice (maybe 3 oz. tops), and there were a couple of artichoke halves on it and a little bit of sauce.  It was about 4\" long and 3\" wide, and it came with a small section of a baguette.

I left very disappointed and felt hungry (and I am not a heavy eater at all).  I will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Just found multiple hairs in my salad. I really hate this place and now this just does it. Never going back to any Panera."}
{"text":"Hi! 5 stars for customer service! There was a young girl who worked this morning and offered us a slice of the tom basil bread before we decided to buy a loaf! Thanks for the great customer service! Appreciate you!"}
{"text":"I've been to other Panera Bread locations that are better.

A friend and I visited this location after going to Erin Mills Town Centre for some post-chrismas shopping.  We arrived after 2pm, and while it was busy, tables were freeing up quickly.  We nabbed a table, and then went to place our order.

There was only ONE person taking orders, creating a backlog.  And when he took our order, it was just perfunctory, not friendly in any way, but at least repeating everything we said to confirm the order.  It wasn't until we sat down that we realize he never asked for our My Panera Rewards number.  We were going to head back up, but saw the line-up and said forget it.

When the order was picked-up, the chicken salad sandwich was totally collapsed.  It was impossible to eat it like a sandwich, and instead we had to use a soup spoon to pick up the \"fillings\".  What a mess!

But worse of all was the ladies' washroom.  I recall the last time I was at this location, it was the same problem.  Paper towels all over, and one of the stalls had TP all over the floor.  Ugh - Disgusting.

It was already after the lunch rush, so we expected better.  As I said, other Panera locations have been better."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to a gluten free breakfast, but missed the 11am cutoff and was informed that the menu online hasn't been updated. They no longer offer the power breakfasts that are gluten free. Needless to say I was bummed. The gentleman that helped me was fantastic. He not only felt bad, but comped my tomato soup and chips. Then, he came by my table a while later to offer me a drink. Hard to find customer service like that!! Very impressive."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for lunch and has been since St Louis Bread Co opened in St Louis Mo -- however--this is not the first time, but, will be the last time I will go to Panera Bread after 2 PM. The reason--decaf coffee is NOT available in the majority of the stores I have gone to for a cup of coffee after 2 PM. And I ask why Not--I am a senior over 70 years of age. If I drink caffeinated coffee after 2 PM bindi not sleep at night. Caffeinated coffee is also bad for my heart and for my eye pressure. I feel Panera is discriminating against the elderly. Oh yes in am usually told that it can be made, but will take a while!! Fortunately I can go to Starbucks for decaf coffee after 2 PM-----"}
{"text":"By far the worse Panera ever! Pasta was extra slaty and the broccoli was extra cooked. Felt like I was eating smashed up baby food. So many choices in the area...pick one over this place."}
{"text":"The food is good. Service is decent. The staff is super nice. Their wifi is slow. You can only be on their slow wifi for 30 minutes."}
{"text":"I tried their new broth bowl.  There is a lentil quinoa option with a choice of hard boiled egg or chicken. There is also soba/buckwheat noodle option with a choice of edamame mix or chicken that I had.  It seemed like beef broth made from a bouillon cube with gobs of black pepper and some soy sauce, so that was disappointing.  The soba noodles were cooked properly, but they tend to crumble in your mouth compared to traditional wheat noodles.  There was some shredded carrots, sesame seeds, and a few fresh spinach and cilantro leaves.  The chicken breast slices were overcooked, which probably happened because the broth cooked them further.  They piled slices on top of the mound of noodles to help prevent some of this.  If I ate the chicken first instead of mixing it into the broth, it probably would have been better. 

You can add a salad or half sandwich for a few dollars more.  The meal comes with bread, apple or potato chips.  Now they have a wonderful soft white dinner roll which used to be a hunk of a baguette until maybe mid 2014.  You can still get the baguette, but we also noticed another dinner with a whole wheat dinner roll that had oat flakes sprinkled on the outside.

 I doubt I will order the bowl again.  The salads and paninis seems to be their forte.

I still find it really lengthy to decide my order at Panera.  The menu board is massive and there are basically no menu descriptors since there is no room.  Still, one of things I love is that they have a wide variety of offerings."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat for good sandwiches, soup and pastries.  The one by Sherway is my go to location.  The people working there are friendly and the service is good.  The locations have a nice warm feel to them as if you're at a cottage minus the urban jungle when you look out the window.  As soon as I walk in I get excited about the sandwiches and I'm not a big bread eater.  In the US I'd say their menu is a little different and a little better but it's still good here. 
The ingredients in their sandwiches taste fresh and compliment each other well.  The soups taste homemade and not like they're out of a can.  The pastries are a little more of a hit and miss for me.  I enjoy their chocolate croissants but their cookies are average.  Whenever I'm on a road trip going through the states Panera Bread is my favourite place to stop off and grab some food.  The coffee is average as well but that's because I like Starbucks coffee. 
If you're ever passing one and you're wondering about how it is, stop and give it a try because there are lots of options and it's delicious."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I go there 3 - 4 times a week for my breakfast&lunch. I love their soufflé so much but they serve it only at breakfast time. They have the best hazelnut coffee in town"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat is Panera Bread. I was just in Pennsylvania where I went to three different locations. This one is just a little different. 

I got there at 11:30 expecting it to get busy from all of the businesses nearby. The worst part of the process is finding a place to park. I am not sure if you have to pay to park in the lot to the rear. I saw a sign that said $3. 

My ordering process went quickly as usual. At THIS location they give you a pager. You put the pager on the circle on the end of the table. I assumed that your meal was then delivered to you. I am used to picking it up in the narrow area which seems to be in all locations. This narrow area even has seating which the others I have visited I do not recall having. Someone brought me my meal very promptly. In fact, I was there with a friend and the meal came before my friend got done ordering and getting her water. 

Right now my favorite salad is the strawberry chicken poppyseed salad. It did not disappoint. Its a huge salad with pineapple, strawberry, blueberries, pecans, chicken and mandarin oranges. 

They seem to have very good help who give excellent customer service. This location was very busy from 11:30 till 2pm when I left. There is a larger dining area in the back. The configuration in each location seems to be very different."}
{"text":"What has Happened Here???  
I'll make this brief as it isn't worth too much of my time.  i've been at this location a number of times since moving into the area almost a year ago.  I have also been to other Panera locations in the city.  This was Paradise Bakery when I first moved here...now it's Panera.
It's always been \"okay\" and I could count on a certain level of consistency - this time - not so much.
I ordered a chicken salad sandwich for take -out recently and frankly had a difficult time locating the chicken salad between the bread.  In the past you could hardly contain the amount of chicken salad on the sandwich, there was so much.....
There have been changes at Paradise Bakery/Panera - and their parent company.  If this is a sample of other changes to come,I'll have to cross Panera off my list of places to visit
They need to keep in mind that Cafe Zupa is right around the corner and serves \"killer\" soups, salads and sandwiches."}
{"text":"tip:  don't order the Thai wonton broth bowl. disgusting! rest of the food is pretty good. love the push to use clean ingredients!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and always had an enjoyable experience! Recently I came here with a couple of friends to have a meal before a soccer game. I decided to go for the whole Chicken Cobb Salad with avocado and a side of baguette. I love their salads here. There were a lot of avocados in my salad and being an avocado lover...I have to say that I was in heaven! There were chunks of bacon, hard-boiled eggs cut in halves and loads of chicken slices in my salad. The creamy dressing and chunks of blue-cheese in there made it even better! 

The staff there is always friendly  (they never rush you to order when you are stuck at what you want to order cause everything seems sooo yummy!) and I love the fact that you can order and just to chill in a booth and have someone bring your food to you. They have free wifi and a rewards point system. Speaking of rewards point system! I was able to get a free Chai Latte! It was a bit too foamy for my liking but it came in a huge mug and tasted just right!
Came here with a couple of friends to have a meal before a soccer game. I decided to go for the whole Chicken Cobb Salad with avocado and a side of baguette. Loved it"}
{"text":"How can anyone say they like this better than Paradise Bakery when it has the EXACT SAME menu?! FALSE ADVERTISEMENT  - Lame!!"}
{"text":"JUST NOW, 3/27/17  Trying to pre-order lunch.\" must be thru website\" per call to store. OK, started. too early to place order so call, \"sure the website login will hold your order\" , OK so no it didn't. Call them, \"hey can I just order this by phone?\" , umm, no, catering, call catering. OK so call them. Um, no you don't call catering OMG...so call the store now, \" listen Sir, I'm having a hard time, I tell my story, can I please just call it in?\" , nice story, \" I'm  busy, call me back in an hour or two....OMG...we'll do Mexican instead...
service is horrible."}
{"text":"Just got off the phone after attempting to call them five times in a row. Each time the call just ends after the the 8th ring. But that's not the only problem:

I've ordered for my office several times, and it's rare for them to get an entire list of orders correct without mistakes. On top of that, I ask if they can put names on the orders, so it's easier to tell who got what without having to open the packages or peek inside the sandwiches themselves. They tell me that it's something they'll have to do when I pick it up, and sure enough, they make me wait while they try to figure out what each item is so they can name it. Why they don't just do this as they make them is beyond me

For how long we wait for the food, and for how much we pay for it, they quality is average at best. The quality ranges from sub-par to so-so.

The store is also very tight like other reviewers say. You have to squeeze through the line as you enter the main doors, and if you wait for pick-up as I do, you'll have to continually move out of the way of people trying to get down the tiny corridor in the middle. Combined with the very limited parking, this place crowds very easily, and is not recommended for the claustrophobic."}
{"text":"Panera is a great bakery and cafe chain. You can never lose when ordering. There are a variety of menu items, from bagels and pastries to soup and sandwiches, and many more options. Bread is the basis of this chain. Every week, we get breakfast from Panera. The pastries, souffls, and bagels are excellent. For lunch and dinner, the soups, sandwiches, and salads are superb. For dinner, the Crispani pizza is absolutely wonderful. Panera is a great chain where you can always count on getting a great meal."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery is a really good sandwich/bakery chain. It's comparable to Panera (side note: Panera needs to open up in the Valley; you Phoenicians are missing out on another really good sandwich chain). The only major drawback is the lack of details given to you about the order process. This was the first time I ever went to a Paradise Bakery, so I was slightly confused by the process to put together your meal. You order a sandwich first, then go down the line to order a salad or soup if you so desire, then order extras at the end. It sounds simple, but in person it wasn't that intuitive. I kept getting blank stares from the people behind the counter when I was going down the line and not doing anything. There is plenty of seating inside and a few tables outside, although when your outside your sitting in a parking lot along Glendale, so it's not worth it. I had the Ham & Brie sandwich with a side of the Paradise Pasta salad. Take note, you are given a cookie with your sandwich, so you don't need to order a cookie at the end like I did, only to be surprised by the cookie with the sandwich. The sandwich was really good. It was ham with melted brie cheese, honey mustard, and slices of green apples. It was really good. The flavors all worked really well together to create a great sandwich. The pasta salad also tasted great. The cookies are what Paradise is known for and they didn't disappoint. The oatmeal raisin is excellent, as is the white chocolate macadamia nut. Overall, if you're looking for a good place for sandwiches and sweets, head to Paradise, even though it's a large chain. They're all over the Valley."}
{"text":"The Brecksville Panera is one of the best locations I've been to.  When I stopped in here, I had the Asiago Roast Beef sandwich with chips as a side. That is one of my favorite sandwiches there. The bread matches perfectly with what's inside. They put a little bit of horseradish in the sandwich which adds a kick to the sandwich, but doesn't ruin the sandwich.Their chips are among the best I've ever had. They are really crisp and salty, just the way potato chips should be. For more info about the food at Panera, refer to my review of the Hudson location. This location is on the small side, but it's nice. They actually have a back patio which overlooks Chippewa Creek. The place is very clean and there is plenty of seating. Overall, if you are in the Brecksville area, or anywhere near a Panera, stop in for a great lunch, or breakfast, or even a quick dinner."}
{"text":"We had an all around terrible experience. This is not like most Paneras. The bread was stale, the food wasn't fresh and the atmosphere was depressing. On top of all that it was somehow $16 for a sand which and salad."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is a disaster! I think they messed up every single part of our visit from the ordering process to getting our food. It seemed like everyone else had issues too, I don't think I saw one table that didn't have to pull the manager over for an issue. The layout of the restaurant is so convoluted it just manages to make a bad situation worse."}
{"text":"What are they giving away for free at this Panera?   Whatever it is, I didn't get my share.

Seriously, I've been to this Panera multiple times and, each time, it has been mobbed.  Finding a place to sit can be a challenge, but the service is usually on-point.   

The food is standard Panera fare - satisfying, but not a knock-out.

Whatever corporate real estate buyer chose this place to open a Panera deserves kudos.   This is obviously a good location for the business based on the crowds present."}
{"text":"I love this Panera bread location primarily because employees are friendly to everyone. You can tell the strong dynamic of this place, and I'm always welcomed at the door. I have to give a special shout out to Amanda whose service is friendly, informative, and charming. I wasn't sure about items I hadn't tried yet, and she was so patient and suggested some options and told me the ingredients in them. I appreciate her customer service because other restaurants make you feel rushed, but she was genuinely kind. Thank you, Amanda!"}
{"text":"Before when this was Paradise Bakery, I thought this was one of the worst locations by far. Even though I lived right next to it, I would go to other locations. Now that it is Panera, I find their service to be AMAZING! There has been times where they have messed up on my food with special requests, but they immediately fix what was wrong without any issues. Now I go here at least 2-3 times a week. Shoutout to Thomas for being an outstanding employee with a great attitude every time I come in!!"}
{"text":"Given that Panera is a chain restaurant, you expect a certain amount of predictability in the quality of your food, no matter what time of day you order.  I came in later in the evening, and ordered the turkey and cranberry flatbread.  Whatever lettuce they put on it was completely wilted and had no flavor, the turkey was painfully dry, and I think there may have been one cranberry on each sandwich.  Honestly, the best part of the meal was the bag of chips that came with my meal.  

The way they have the registers set up is completely confusing and I stood by the front registers for a good amount of time before a girl over in the bakery told me she could ring me up.  I also feel like the pricing has gotten a little ridiculous for the amount of food you actually get.  I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"My kids and I enjoy eating Panera Bread food, you can pretty much rely that it will taste the same at all locations. With that being said, not every location has the best customer service. This one has the worst customer service. Every time I come in here either something is wrong with the order, the people are unkind, and nobody cares to help anyone. I come with my kids and I don't expect help,but the fact that nobody even offers kind of erks me. Also, the highchairs are located in a very poor spot far away from where you need to pick up your food (by the bathroom)."}
{"text":"They never get anything right when you place an online order.  It's like they don't read it or double check it before it goes on the shelf"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying the food and unfortunately was not impressed...quality wasn't great and it's way over priced ...dishes were filthy...onion  was pretty good !! We got three soups for $25 ...lol"}
{"text":"I want to start off this post by saying that I love Panera bread, like love Panera bread. However after my experience at this Panera bread, I will never.... NEVER come back again. First, they lady in front of my order 2 dozen bagels, they girl behind the counter proceeded to put them in to bags. Filled them to the brim. The lady asked for a bag with handles to obviously carry both the bags, and she responded \"let me see\" as if it was so much trouble for here to pull out a bag to make it easier for the lady to carry her purchase. 

Next I order my meal... the same meal I order all the time at every Panera bread I have been to across the country. Thai chicken salad, french onion soup and sliced apples. The ONLY request I make is to filter out the onions. It's NEVER been an issue. I sit down, and this young, but very rude lady puts the plate on the table, and said, \"we can't filter out the onions\", the literally turns around. Doesn't wait for a response, doesn't apologize... nothing. Oh, and my apples were not sliced. 

I walk back up to the counter. Explain that this has never been and issues before, and the soup itself is actually cold. One girl explains that they do not have a strainer, while another girl at the same time says it's the best we can do with a very sarcastic grin. I simply ask them to at the very least heat it up. 

The same girl with long brown hair comes back with the tray, literally slams is down... walks away. I even said thank you, and she didn't even respond. 

I was so furious/upset, I decided to write this note right away as I eat my awful meal. Oh, and in the midst or writing this, another table next to me got their order wrong as well... but I guess there's nothing else they can do."}
{"text":"I would normally give 5 stars to Paradise because I really love it, but today I did not get the bacon bits, shredded cheese, or green onion topped on my cup of baked potato soup.  :(. It's the little things Paradise/Panera."}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan of Panera Bread.  Maybe I just expected to much - but for a company that tauts having freshly baked bread and the freshest ingredients, I would expect that they would make all of their sandwiches fresh as well.  I do not eat meat and upon reviewing the menu, I saw something that sounded appealing.  It had chicken in it, so I asked if they could simply not put chicken on my panini.  The cashier told me they couldn't do that, because the sandwich came to them preassembled.  

I try not to be so picky, because I know that I choose to limit what I eat of my own violition.  

I can't remember what I ended up ordering, but I wasn't satisfied with it or the service."}
{"text":"The Cheddar Broccoli Soup was fine, but nothing special for nearly $6.  The French Baguette that came with the soup was hard as a rock, small and cut my gums.  The Roasted Turkey & Avocado BLT Sandwich was way overpriced, smaller than expected and didn't have much of the ingredients in it.  Hardly any avocado, tiny amount of roasted turkey, little to no mayo, wimpy lettuce piece and one micro-sized pre-made piece of bacon.  Overall...pretty tasteless and inadequate for around $9.  The flavor was not very dynamic.  I make much better sandwiches at home and they don't run me $9.  The 1 oz. bag of their own brand Kettle-Cooked Potato Chips was not too bad, but for the large sandwich price, you would think it would include some sort of potato salad or pasta side.  And the Pecan Roll was pretty good to finish things off, although overpriced at $3.  Almost $20 for one person to eat and that didn't even include a drink.  Just not worth the trip for me or my daughter, who also was not impressed in the least.

On the flip side, the employees there were very nice and friendly.  They were the best part of my experience.  But since I didn't come there mainly to interact with them, the food will not bring  be back again and I would NOT recommend Panera Bread to anyone."}
{"text":"Mediterranean salad was freshly made and a good enough size (I'm a fairly big eater).  Service was ok quick. Half of the patrons there were UNLV students.
It's trendy, with tasty, healthy fare.  Self serve lemonade and iced tea is a big plus, especially on a hot Vegas summer day.
Will be back."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese is amazing here! It's like every other panera, bright and bubbly and the staff is very prompt and kind."}
{"text":"Love panera bread!!!! It's my favorite!! Their pick 2 is the best, I love the chicken rice soup and half sandwich. And their service is very good at this location! They always make sure you have everything you need!"}
{"text":"Service was not pleasant.  They mislabeled the coffee (hazelnut is not optimal).  The egg and cheese bagel was missing cheese."}
{"text":"One extra star for the spacious two-storey layout and relatively quiet atmosphere! The background music is soft. A really great place for conversations and reading. The drink, food, and soup selection is great too."}
{"text":"Not recommended at all! 
This location is the worst experience with Panera Bread. Upon entry, we noticed faint smell of sour milk mixed with the smell of chemicals probably they use to clean the floor! The worst part was when we received our order which was hot chocolate. It was cold, tasted weird and sour! I asked for the spoon and after 10 minutes and a reminder she gave me a dirty dull spoon which I preferred not to use. The customer service was very unpleasant though. 
I never get back to this location and I'm not sure if I can make myself going to Panera Bread ever again!"}
{"text":"I'm here debating on writing a review till I start reading the other reviews and decided I should include my awful experience. I don't know if this location is franchised or part of the corporation but I know that it needs some TLC. How do u as managers not walk into your location and take pride in your job. I work at the best breakfast place and the first thing I do when I get to work is look around and determine how would the guest feel if they came in and what might make it better. Your location has gone down hill mighty fast. Very dirty this evening. My family came in at 6:30 and all the booths were dirty( first thing a guest might notice) went to order the most popular salad (Fiji apple) no salad dressing they ran out. Amy came and asked me what soup I wanted and decided to roll her eyes as I asked to try the autumn soup and kept a mad look on her face the entire time she helped me. There was no manager on the floor and the kids were running the place with a lack of guest focus or having polite customer service. If you are part of the corporate chain I would highly suggest u take a little more focus on providing a clean atmosphere as well as having more friendly approachable staff. If you would like to talk more about my visit please feel free to respond. This is all to make u better and grow for more people to enjoy your concept. Remember it's all about the guest and your losing that focus as u transfer into a new but same concept!!!"}
{"text":"I'm complaining here but I have never been to this location when the wait hasn't been terrible.  I'm on the run today and stopped for a sandwich to go and 30 minutes later....still waiting.  This used to be a paradise bakery so thinking they are probably different as a Panera and it was just the same...really long wait when it's just not very busy.  

And I've got plenty of time on my hands to write a review."}
{"text":"Two words: Come early. If you want to get any variety of baked goods, you've got to be there before 3pm. The quality of food is about what you would expect from a McDonaldized bakery. Most people don't know that they don't literally bake there; things come either half-baked and/or frozen and are finished in the store. Not terrible, just know what you're getting. The service for me is hit or miss."}
{"text":"I'm going here regularly for lunch. Love the paninis and the soup. it's laid back atmosphere good for meetings or browsing the internet"}
{"text":"The staff is unfriendly and drone around like they don't want to be there. The place is not clean. Coffee is old. 

I like Paradise but this café in particular is not up to par."}
{"text":"Holy cow...worst experience at Paradise Bakery. Ever.  I went there before work to get a baker's dozen of bagels (comes with 2 tubs of spread).  It took forever for Shawn to get my flavors of bagels put together in the box (I was the only one there!).  Then I asked for plain and honey walnut spreads.  She said they only carry plain and lowfat spread in the big tub.  All other flavors come in individual size only.  They all insisted there never was honey walnut flavor in the big size tub yet I've purchased it for work before. At the end of my purchase, Kimberly came to me and told me that I could pre-order my bagels the next time.  That was a nice offer, but going in for a dozen bagels should not take that much time and should not warrant a pre-order.  I'm definitely going to Einstein's for their bagels and honey walnut spread from now on."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Panera! The location is awesome, the service is great and the food is AMAZING! I can't go without getting the Mac n Cheese!"}
{"text":"I'm liking this place a lot. First, the in house music. New, Hip. More than just background camo. Tables always available (Mornings) Their Asiago cheese bagels way better than Einsteins. Coffee refills till your wiring is all fried! My one complaint is the WiFi. Maybe it's just my Mac. Difficult to get on. I sometime piggy back off Total Wine next door.  (Panera Wi-Fi just kicked in.) Still a five star."}
{"text":"This is a Panera, so the food is exactly what you would expect. Overstaffed for the service quality and speed...as I stand here at 3:00 PM there are 8 staff on, with two working. That'd be fine if everything was clean or if the service was good. Horrific bathrooms. One of the stalls in the men's room has been out of order for at least six months."}
{"text":"Just average food. Love the iced tea, bagels and soufflé. Everything else is overpriced in my opinion. Id rather eat local."}
{"text":"The service was extremely unprofessional and our order was missing several items. The food quality was still good, but no one seemed to know what they were doing."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, and each time, the food does not taste good.  Today was the worst, as the customer service was poor as well.  I ordered a coffee only to find out they had run out.  They didnt even bother to say they were making more, so I asked for a refund and ordered a cappucino instead.  The manager acted like she didnt care. The bagel I ordered was greasy and tasted disgusting.  The cream cheese was not creamy at all, and had a liquidy texture.  Even my friend who had liked her cookie and tea the last time, commented that her grill cheese sandwich tasted weird and the bag of chips that she got was barely one quarter full. As we walked past Aroma Espresso on the way out, we both decided that next time we would go there instead."}
{"text":"This Panera does a steady business. They are right in the heart of a heavy medical area- hospital, LTAC, several rehab centers, doctor's offices, etc. It is our \"go to\" place. I have been there more times than i can count and don't believe they have ever messed up my order. One of their employees ran me down in the parking lot once because he forgot to put my extra salad dressing in the bag. One of their managers, Jaimee, has been there a long time. She knows her \"regulars\" and will greet you by name when you come in. I have never had a bad meal or bad service at this Panera."}
{"text":"I don't eat at Panera very often. If I didn't have one closer to where I live I would never go again.  At least 4 people walked out of line do to how slow they are. I had to go back three times for them to get my order right. What a same."}
{"text":"The service here is poor. We had a line waiting for orders to be taken and one of the staff took someone out of line to wait upon. When she was done she looked at the line and left her position not to be seen again. The person who did finally wait on me was clearly unhappy,likely because of the fact she was left up front alone. This is not the first time I've had problems with service here. I will avoid this store in the future."}
{"text":"Their broccoli cheddar soup is awesome.  The only thing is you can't let it sit...it loses it's consistency and becomes very thin instead of thick.  I love eating it with the side of bread.  I usually get the you pick two, and get the frontega chicken sandwhich which is warm and tasty!  My picky son even likes the broccoli cheddar soup, and he's picky!"}
{"text":"Panera Bread is always a good bet for fast, fresh casual dining.  We tend to end up here instead of McAllisters because the ambiance is nicer.  The staff at this location is friendly and the food is served quickly.  I do find it frustrating that this particular location always seems to be out of bread bowls when I'm craving soup on a cold or rainy Friday (the only time I really think about soup in a bread bowl).  It would seem that the manager would be able to tailor their baking schedule to take advantage of that."}
{"text":"I love their drive thru service. I order ahead and pick up at the window -- it's as fast as a fast-food burger drive thru but much more healthy. Also do their rapid pickup and they perform well there as well."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying that the restaurant is well put. The sandwhiches and smoothies are good, but apart from the pastry, there isn't really anything too special about it."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong here!  They have take out so you can eat at home. The broccoli and cheddar soup is the most amazing thing in the planet.  You also can order it at anytime you don't have to wait until 11 like other places. Same goes with breakfast items as long as they still have the bagels."}
{"text":"A week ago we order out form this location. When I got home I realized that they forgot part of the order. We called and talked to the manager and she said she would replace it and to come in whenever.  Today me and my mom went in, we let the cashier know the situation and she went got the manager.  She remember me and waited for the cashier to take our order. I was expecting just my meal to be free but she gave us everything for free! 
It was really awesome to see the whole staff super caring for their customers and taking care of them.  I work in retail and understand the importance but they went above and beyond my expectations!!! And not to mention their food is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I loved the freshness of Paradise Bakery food. My favorite soup was their tomato soup. I was eager to try Panera, as I had eaten there when I lived in the East Coast. 
I ordered the tomato soup at Panera. It was clearly not freshly made. Honestly, it had more in common with Campbell's soup than Paradise Bakery, including the weird mouth coating you get from eating canned soup. It was bland and tasteless. The roll that came with it was also just so-so. Nothing appears to be freshly made now.
The setup of the place is confusing, but the staff was polite and friendly.
Sadly, not going back. I miss my favorite soup."}
{"text":"I rally like this panera.
Always great food, but a bit much $ for what you get I think.   However, the quality is great, and also consistent, so you get what you pay for.    
The tea is the best.  Great bread bowls! !!"}
{"text":"I ordered the tomato mozzarella flat bread & broccoli cheddar soup. The flat bread was delicious but the portion was laughable. For $5 or $6 this thing was a joke. Idk who could get filled up on this thing? Anyways, I heard good things about the broccoli cheddar soup so I ordered it & i was surprised that it tasted liked they used canned cheese. It was gross, I've had a lot better broccoli cheddar soup in my life. And again the portion was sad. For paying over $10, I expect to get a good amount of food. I was still hungry afterwards & they gave me bread instead of chips too. I would have gotten this corrected but I already drove back to work before I noticed."}
{"text":"The food is always great here, however the service at this location is horrible! Everyone of the staff members with the exception of the young man making our salads were very rude! While trying to place an order for a sandwich the staff members were standing around talking and completely ignored our existence for several minutes before someone finally turned around and realized there was a line forming! I will never come to this location again and I will make sure none of my friends or family do either!"}
{"text":"I went to this place with a gift card and it was no good. I paid 13 dollars for a half ass sandwhich and a small mac and cheese and wasnt that good at all. All in all I got maybe a 500 calorie meal for the massive price tag I have wife I have kids I have BMW I cannot spend 13 dollars for such a small meal. Disappointed, but the quality was good but no good for the price"}
{"text":"I'm at this Panera Bread everyday! Matter of fact, I'm waiting for it to open right now at 6:30am.  Most of the employees & managers know my favorite Fuji Apple Salad, no chx, sub avocado.  As a non-Pitt & non-CMU Student, this is my favorite location to do school work because the majority of the students are hogging the Oakland Panera Bread wifi.  If you are an online student as well, this is a less crowded Panera and you sure will find an open outlet without any hassle.  I highly recommend the Fuji Apple Chx Salad, No chx, substitute Avocado along with Panera's fresh brewed hazelnut coffee.  -Amberlee"}
{"text":"Worst panera ever. Really dirty. Staff very unfriendly. Not the panera you see on TV advertisements"}
{"text":"If only there was an option for no star rating. I dont even know where to begin with this place. Like what everyone has already said...the staff seem unprofessional and slow. All of the time. The bathrooms are a wreck. I went to the stall only to find a dirty toilet seat and crap in the toilet. The food was okay but my broccoli cheddar soup was watered down and cold. Never again. The kids working there seem more interested in talking and socializing than doing their job. Its really sad. I've even heard one kid talk about spitting in the food. Disgusting!!!! If you are hungry...go somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"Perfect pastry and cookies. Breakfast sandwiches I've tried have been excellent, though they seem pricy. I understand that they're new, and there are always growing pains... But the horrible layout is never going to change. I typically order iced coffee, and the self-service coffee station is right near the registers. However, though I'm issued my cup at the register; I have to push through the narrow, congested hallway/waiting area past the kitchen to get to the cold drink area at the back to get ice for my iced coffee--it's not even visible from the front, so I had to ask the first time; then push back up front to dispense and doctor my coffee with cream and sugar; then... Where are the lids?? Only one size up front: small as it seems to fit their hot coffee lid slots ... Oh, back with the ice and soda. It's so non-intuitive that on my second trip I also forgot to grab a lid, and on my third trip I remembered the lid but forgot my straw.  You just don't expect to have to manage a lid and a straw in one hand while dispensing ice and your drink using the other, while hiking the hallway, using your third hand for the paper bags of breakfast--all that for very mediocre iced coffee. 

Staff was... New. I'll wait for a while before commenting as it's hard when everyone is new and you can't learn by example. 

Overall, frustrating. I leave feeling rushed and irritated, which adds to the sense that the meal wasn't worth the price I paid. I'm waiting for a few months before trying again."}
{"text":"check your bank account after eating here if you pay with a debt card... they are thieves - will charge your account twice. if you call and complain - the manager will tell you that it happens all the time, it's a system error and that the charge is just pending and it will fall off in a few days, and then hang up on you when you tell them they need to fix it now. well guess what - the pending charge did not fall off. i was charged twice. i would highly suggest after eating here that you check your bank account because if it does happen all the time, then i'm sure i an not the only one that they are stealing from. will not be back panera. thanks for the horrible customer service. a fraud investigation has been filed against you since it \"happens all the time\""}
{"text":"So bummed this morning -- I was greeted with a long line, no coffee left in the pots, no cream in the carafe, and my bagel was stale. I won't be rushing back!"}
{"text":"This Panera drive is terrible. The 1st time I was here I was told I get a free pasty for my bday but would have to come inside to pick it out. The 2nd time after I was told that Panera takes Apple Pay, the cashier said they do it accept Apple Pay in the drive thru. Both times I had come from the gym and did not want to subject others to my sweaty self. I came home to grab my debit card and went to the Panera on Frye Rd who DOES accept Apple Pay in the drive thru."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast, as the location had recently opened up. Enjoyed the mediterranean egg white sandwich with sun dried tomatoes, spinach and pesto.  Sandwich was good and bread was very fresh. Also ordered the black cherry smoothie - pretty tasty for cherries, yogurt and ice!!!

What impressed me most was the service - very knowledgable staff that know their products well and make recommendations.  

I also bought bread to take home -looks and smells heavenly.  Will be back to try out the lunch sandwiches."}
{"text":"I love coming to Panera! Ashley Love and Luke always brighten my day. The staff here is so amazing and friendly! We have been coming for years. Great food and wonderful service!"}
{"text":"So after getting horrible service the first time around I told myself I wouldn'tcome back here until they can figure out how to get their stuff together. 

 So I lied and decided to come back here because it was on my way to work and I was hungry for a bagel and cream cheese.  I ended up getting my bagel to-go so I can chow it down at work.  After spreading the cream cheese on took a bite into it I tasted something awkward in my mouth.  I pulled it out and found about 2 inches of a piece of plastic in the bagel!!!!!  I ended up throwing it away and was starving the whole morning.  So I will definitely NOT come back here EVER again!!!  This place needs to close down and figure this 'restaurant' business before it opens to the public!"}
{"text":"Standard Panera, from what I've experienced. In general, I feel that Panera doesn't give much food for what they charge.

On Thursdays from 4:00 to 8:00, students can get any soup in a bread bowl for $3 with the purchase of a drink. Pretty good deal. The bread bowl also comes with chips, apple, or bread. I'm not sure if it was because of the deal (I've only been on weekends before), but there was quite a line when I went around 7 pm. The wait time to order and for the food to be ready wasn't bad, though.

I'll probably be back only for this deal--there are plenty of other places that will give more food for less money."}
{"text":"Panera is a public company and as such is required to file a 10-K.  It's not great reading but in it is a management discussion section that lists external forces that Panera management feels is are a threat to its business.  One item to note is the line that \"We may not be able to convince our customers of the benefits of paying our prices for higher quality food\" I myself am not convinced.  In my humble opinion, two slices of wonder bread, one (at most two) slices of turkey and a leaf of lettuce with a 2 oz. side of potato chips will be worth $10-12 in the year 2032.  I think turkey that is grass fed, free range, and is sung Beethoven is great and all but I see a monetary limit to its value.  Something below $10-12.  

The kids seem to like it and it tastes good enough.  I just don't see the cost justifying a sandwich under-delivery.  I don't mind paying for quality but in this case, I often leave still hungry."}
{"text":"I like the new Panera Bread bakery at Boca Park . Service is good, bread consistent with freshness and taste , very clean , reasonable price, excellent ambiance and location! You should try all the bagels ,bread and pastries. Sooo good!!!"}
{"text":"I am a Panera fanatic! I went to this location pretty late in the evening, but the service was impeccable, the food delish and the seating area very clean. Ready to make this a regular location for me!"}
{"text":"Went to buy cookies today. They have signs on the front door touting have they still have all the great cookies from Paradise Bakery days. Upon ordering, I am told if I buy six, you get six free. Sounds great. Went in mainly for Peanut Butter cookies, but now can get some others. Oh wait, there are less than 15 cookies in the case and none in back. LAME. This is what most people feared when a big corporation buys out the local place.
They also \"remodeled\". You used to be able to observe the food preparation and maybe even get inspired on what to order by things you saw as they came up. Now it is all hidden away behind huge walls.

I will find a new place and support local bakeries."}
{"text":"Walked out without dinner. We've tried to order berry smoothie and cashier said they don't have it. Second my wife tried to order her pasta and same reply we don't have it... WTH.... Big food chain and they didn't have two items listed in menu, sucks... We canceled our order and went somewhere else for dinner.... They need to improve customer service, specially attitude to customer...."}
{"text":"I want to give credit to the hard working staff at this place and note that the young girls working at the front were helpful and great. However the reason for this negative review is in regard to the manager on duty who was preparing the food when I ordered breakfast sandwiches. First off he was rude and distracted and when I asked a simple question about the rest of my order he barked at me that sandwiches and pastries  are picked up at two different locations. Without being informed by either a written sign or verbalization how the heck are customers to know? Also I got my food to go and left. Upon arriving at my location I discovered that one of the sandwiches was burnt to a crisp and it had paper in it melted into the cheese. On what planet is it ok to wrap this up and give it to a customer to eat?!?!? 
Unfortunately I did not take it back based on being on the road. This is in my neighborhood and a place I frequent in order to work and study. But there are other coffee shops with better service and professional staff. I highly recommend passing this one by."}
{"text":"I like the half fast-food system of this place. It has fast service, but it is still sit-down and feels like a normal restaurant. I had the avocado BLT and the Thai salad and I have no complaints. They have a variety of salads, all of which are look very good. They have lots of lunch options and their pastries look delicious too. My only complaint is that it is way overpriced. Half a sandwich (about 3\") is $5.89, for example. At least you get unlimited drinks!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time, I used to enjoy eating Panera Bread.  They have an amazing tomato bread that they use for the Mediterranean Veggie sandwich.  And then we moved and had to start coming to this location.

Let's begin with the fact that the layout of the cash registers at this location just doesn't work at all.  When you walk up, you're not always certain where to go, especially with the menus being split up.  The food has been increasing in price to the point of no longer being competitive.  If I want a reasonable soup or salad, I will certainly go elsewhere.  And then there's the staff, comprised almost entirely of teenagers who spend more time discussing gossip while standing next to each other than they do actually servicing customers.  I've listened to some great debates about what \"he said, she said\" or why so and so \"won't cover my shift!\" while standing right in front of them waiting to be helped.  With such apathetic employees, it's no wonder that the worst case of food poisoning I've ever had was from this place.

One morning, I ordered a sausage, egg and cheese sandwich on a french toast bagel.  I ate most of it, which tasted fine, prior to noticing that what was left of the egg on my plate was GREEN.  I tried to play it cool and convince myself that it was just discolored for some other reason.  I mean, how could someone cook up a green egg?  This isn't Dr. Seuss we're talking about here - this is salmonella.

As the afternoon proceeded, I got beyond sick.  I spent the next 36 hours without sleeping, vomiting a personal record best of 9 times.  The consequence to my nether regions was unspeakable.  And that was the last time I'm ever going to eat at Panera Bread.

Combine that with my other experience, where I watched an employee tear into a handicapped parking spot right in front of the store, without a placard or a plate and run inside.  She proceeded to skip the long line of patrons, waited around for 10 minutes (all the while parked in a handicapped spot), got pulled into the back discreetly, was given a large bag of free food and then happily went on her way.  I alerted management and expected a response but, shocker, there never was a response.

This place is as shady as they come.  Avoid at all costs, unless you like losing 10 lbs in 36 hours due to crippling food poisoning.  But for me, that's not really my idea of a great weight loss plan."}
{"text":"I just ate at Panera here in the District at Green Valley Ranch. The staff here is quite incompetent and they lack knowledge of basic manners. They argue your opinion and bud into personal conversation. They are extremely unorganized and I often find food within my food that does not belong i.e. I find croutons in my Fuji Apple salad every time. I would not recommend eating here for I have also got sick two or three shortly after I have came here!"}
{"text":"This Panera is the worst.  Not only is the wait to order ridiculous even if there is only one person in front of you (take a clue from Starbucks, Panera - assembly line) but the bagels are all hole and no bagel.  The last two I got from there were ridiculous.  They looked like a thin bracelet rather than a bagel.  What the...?"}
{"text":"This Panera is always running out of bread for sandwiches or baguettes at least an hour before they close. Just make extra bread to last till close. How much can it actually cost. It's rediculous. Take the bread out of the name if you can't even serve it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We used to go to the Panera farther away from us, but this new place is great because there's a convenient drive-thru. The soup and sandwiches are great, and healthy. We also love the customer service here. There's always a friendly welcoming staff here just like st Starbucks. I highly recommend this Panera bread because if the drive thru, but all the paneras are fabulous. Great food and customer service. It's a bit pricey like Starbucks but worth it. Enjoy and great job Panerabread."}
{"text":"Food is good...if you can get it. Slowest Panera I've ever been to. Just waited 30 minutes for \"rapid\" pickup. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great food that's quickly made. Clean and nice eating area. Only gets 4 stars because they don't have online rapid ordering like their American counterpart."}
{"text":"I love Panera. Plain and simple. They always get my order wrong, but it's always so good once it's made correctly. Seating and parking are always an issue though. Service is never less than mediocre, generally more on the good side."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwiches are pretty good. This visit I had the steak and egg on a whole wheat bagel. Surprisingly, the steak was not overcooked and it was tender but slightly fatty. 

The ambiance is great at this location due to their seating options; outside, inside or inside the galleria."}
{"text":"There's something about this Panara that grates on my nerves.  Maybe it's the surly service.  Maybe it's the couldn't care less about the customer attitude.  The food is ok but there are other restaurant options close by."}
{"text":"It will serve when you need to kill 1.5 hours while your kid is in their weekly evening event, but just barely. The microwave in the self-serve coffee/tea area sums up the quality of the drinks, food and service of this place. I might even add a bonus 0.5 if they had decaf tea ... but I'm afraid that would be too much of a frill."}
{"text":"Never have I ever been greeted in a restaurant by a cashier scratching her armpit underneath her polo... that is, until I visited this Panera location. I went to grab a coffee and was immediately distracted by Monique- a cashier with (clearly) itchy pits. After the under-the-shirt pit scratch, she proceeded to touch plates, silverware, even a bagel! Gross!! I asked to speak with the manager, and as we discussed the situation, we caught Monique in the act once again! Seems like common sense that itching sweaty body areas wouldn't be acceptable in food service, but maybe I expected too much of Monique. The manager was very nice and understanding and spoke with the employee about the issue (and said she's incurred similar problems with her before!). Also, all 4 coffee dispensers were empty when we went to fill up our cups. Overall, not the best experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been regulars for years and have gotten to know the staff. Great young people many of whom are college students earning money for school. Often this is their first job and the management does a nice job of introducing them to the real world.

The food is good and there is a nice selection including pasteries, check out the hidden menu online or by scanning the symbols at the store. 

The service is good, occassionaly you have to be patient with a new trainee.

The place is popular and sometimes during rush hour there can be a wait.

Nice outside eating area.

The staff has always been friendly to us."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!  I had ordered lunch with son and the manager noticed I had been waiting (really only about ten minutes) and went to check on the order and quickly hand delivered.  All was fine in my opinion but was great to see someone paying attention and being proactive in the event something were to go wrong.  Food was excellent as normal."}
{"text":"WHAT? NO RANCH? I was truly flabbergasted when I was told I couldn't have ranch dressing on my salad since they didn't serve it there any more. She said we weren't ever supposed to serve it but we did when we first opened. So I guess no more Panera for me. No big loss sine I've been unhappy with them ever since they replaced the paradise bakery on alma school and queen creek and opened here on az ave. at first I was optimistic even though PB closed a few weeks before they opened Panera which left a three week gap for a quick healthy place to eat. Then the menu at Panera was so limited and the food just so so. But now with no RANCH? Everyone has ranch. So why not Panera? Are they too snobby for ranch?  Oh well. I'll just go a few more miles to Paradise on Gilbert or even better, Kneaders at San Tan Mktplc. They get 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"I thought I was the only one having to cross off choices whenever I'd come into this location. Depending on where I am when I feel like Broccoli Cheddar soup, a sandwich, or pastries, I'd stop into the Library Road Panera Bread. Service is not a strong point here, and I've sent correspondence to the companys website, about my experiences at this location. It's not that the food is terrible, but a paying customer will take so many misses, before moving on to something better."}
{"text":"I stopped into this Panera Bread at Caste Village for the first time this Sunday since I had a craving for some Cheddar Broccoli soup with French baguette. Being someone who prefers to not sit around in a Panera, the location is nice, but not enough to make me want to sit. 
There wasn't much of a crowd so placing my order was quick, and Lindsey at the register was okay. She couldn't wait to get back to chatting with her co-worker. 

While waiting for my order, I heard the girls behind the counter telling another customer there were no to go spoons available for her order. Really not a good thing when your business advertises catering, and has a sizable amount of to go customers, and you sell soup!

My to go order of a quart of the Cheddar Broccoli soup with baguette was up next, and was not placed in the brown bag Panera usually puts to go orders in. At this point I was regretting my decision to leave a tip at the register.

On my receipt was a message to ask to speak to a manager if there was anything missing from my order. At this point, I've figured this won't be my go to Panera location."}
{"text":"The food is a given if you like sandwiches and you like salads and you wouldn't mind a great cookie...this is the place for you. It's consistent and all store fronts but, I have to point out that the character of a place starts and ends with the customer service and the Eastern location did that for me! Michael the Catering Manager asked me (3) times how my day was going...it's hard to get people I see on a daily basis to do that so (3) made me feel important. Then he offered me some water as I was waiting...I could have been fooled I thought I was in a fine dining establishment. I used their catering option and ordered (6) boxed lunches over the phone. They were no hassle... silverware was in their napkins were in there. Can't say enough...they made my afternoon a little easier with their extra attention. Thank you Panera"}
{"text":"Internet is extremely slow , I tested the speed it was  80kbps just a bit faster than a modem"}
{"text":"Far and away this is my office's favorite lunch place. The salad selection is so large that you can have something different every day and still eat healthy. Their healthy choice of Apple for a side really helps too."}
{"text":"Food is OK but the services is bad!! Get my order wrong both time when I went there."}
{"text":"I had a VERY sad roast beef sandwich. It was almost impossible to find the roast beef and overall very forgettable.  So NOT worth the $"}
{"text":"Yum city. the mac n cheese is delicious, the price however is not."}
{"text":"Worst Panera ever!!!! There is no line when you walk in. People cut in front of me several times. I'm pretty certain there is no manager at this location!!!   Don't get me started on the attitude of workers! They would rather be anywhere but here.  Question: How can the food be so much worse at one Panera over another? Close it up and try again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our lunch was off to a good start, the cashier was sweet, the place was clean....everything went well,except..... the drinks tasted like straight up water ! And after a long drive that's even worse! I was so looking forward to a nice beverage m.I am ticked off about that!"}
{"text":"Horrrrrrrrrendous service early in the morning, especially when they have to go orders"}
{"text":"I love the food but they need to make sure they don't keep running out of things!! Saturday morning at 915am, they were already out of everything bagels! And Sunday during lunch hour they were already out of broccoli cheddar soup. My heart was set on broccoli cheddar soup so we had to go to a different panera!"}
{"text":"My Chai latte from here was essentially sweet milk... maybe they forgot to add the chai? It happens frequently at Paneras. Not sure why"}
{"text":"Panera Bread has finally expanded across the borders!!!

The food served is generally the same as all Panera Breads I've been to. The environment is absolutely comforting and during the warmer months, the outside seating is the best! The workers here are well trained and one of the best I've encountered so far. Also, this location is very different compared to the other Paneras I've been to south of the border - there's waiters/waitresses that cleans up your plates after you are done eating instead of dropping the plates off yourself at the cleaning station. 

This location is located right next to Sherway Gardens and is part of the outdoor shopping area. This restaurant is one of the healthier options compared to the fast food chains all around it."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. French onion soup is great!. The bread was really good, very fresh.  The panni sandwich was melted just right."}
{"text":"I think it's more than likely that people on this site get the gist of what Panera is.  There are several branches in Madison alone, each of them providing fresh tasty food and very acceptable coffee drinks (and seriously tasty smoothies!), along with comfortable, well-lit seating areas that, as in any place with coffee and power outlets, are shamelessly used as study zones/campsites by roving packs of undergrads.  

I'd just like to mention this particular location as one where I've never had a meal or pastry I didn't like and the service is always good. Sometimes people are a little inexperienced, but when this is the case, a senior employee/manager always seems to be there and ready to help (but not hovering... that is the worst).  On one occasion, a newish employee got distracted and forgot to finish my latte.  After waiting a few minutes (and actually seeing it sitting there partially complete), I flagged down the first unoccupied employee I saw to mention that it might have gotten left.  It turned out that it was a mustachioed man in his... fifties? (sorry sir if you read this and I got it wrong) who I believe to be a manager there, and he immediately apologized, finished it for me himself, and encouraged me to pick out a cookie or pastry free of charge.  I thought I would be magnanimous, but then I thought about their tasty chocolate pastries and I caved.  In any case, I appreciate the mentality of making it right when a mistake occurs.  

Other things that are nice: fresh bagels with fancy cream cheeses, the smoothies (I know, I said it already, but I'm kind of obsessed), and the soup in a bread bowl."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating here.  I thought it would be similar to Wildflower, which I love, but I was disappointed.  I ordered the Chicken Cobb Salad and two kids mac n cheese, all to go.  The kids meals were $4.99.  The serving of mac n cheese was quite small, probably good for a 4 year old.  ( my kids are 9 and 12) Wildflower portions of pasta and sauce are at least double in size to what we got here, and I think the meal is cheaper as well.  My salad came in a box that I couldn't quite figure out how to open.  Not saying that was bad or good, just different.  The flavor of the salad was ok.  Not something I would order again.  The cheese was supposedly gorgonzola.  There was very little of it, and it was not very strong.  I could barely tell that it was in the salad.  The dressing was odd, not a typical cobb salad dressing.  Also, I believe Cobb Salad typically has chopped egg in it and there was no egg.  Maybe they don't use it.  The turkey Cobb at Wildflower is waaaayyyyyy better.  Sorry, Panera, you left me unimpressed.  Oh yeah, we tried a brownie too.  Meh."}
{"text":"Clean dining area. Friendly efficient staff good food served fresh. I look forward to trying more menu items in the future. Decent prices. Food is cooked to order."}
{"text":"I came here last month and didn't have the chance to write my review until now. I honestly have to say that this place has TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. It seems as if the workers, (especially the girls) likes to insult customers a lot. Loud enough for me to hear at least. It was a few of them that were near this one guy who had earrings I think? These girls have no right to be stuck up. I don't know what makes them think there superior to others. Who ever is in charge of hiring workers there needs to learn how to find better people. It's quite sad that these workers think they can insult customers who are actually helping them make sales. Very immature."}
{"text":"Panera is one of our family's favorite restaurants. Everything is great. Kids love bagels and chicken noodle soup. Adults usually order \"you pick two\". Sandwiches, salad are all very good."}
{"text":"Food is always good.  The problem is their drinking water.   It tastes absolutely disgusting!!!  I talked to the manager and he acknowledged the problem and said there is nothing they can do about it. Seriously??  I know it's more profitable to sell expensive Fuji bottled water then to fix the water filters but that is unacceptable."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! Get home to find my baguettes were not included! Open my salads to find they are half full with one having the core of a lettuce included. Lazy. Disappointing. Sloppy. Unwarranted for how slow you were..maybe that's the reason, people aren't happy with the location! Come on Panera you need to step up your game!"}
{"text":"Slow and rude service. Frequently get orders wrong. Employees are just hanging out and don't work to keep things going. It's been empty the two times I have been here. Can't see this place staying open for very long. Coffee dispensers are dirty and empty. Everything I ordered was made incorrectly. The chicken noodle soup, which is good at other locations, was three pieces of chicken, three noodles, and water."}
{"text":"This Panera does NOT EXIST! We followed Panera's address to the location it listed at the SanTan mall and it does not exist! We were very hungry and upset we couldn't get our coffee and bagels! We even called the phone number listed for this Panera since it's still listed as operating, and of course, no one answered!! DO NOT GO!"}
{"text":"This Panera does NOT EXIST!! We went in on our second attempt to find a Panera after we couldn't find one at the SanTan outdoor mall so we came here- only to find this one doesn't exist either!! Do not waste your time at either location. No paneras!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Panera I have ever visited. Whomever was is charge around 3: 30pm was extremely rude. He was condescending to the other employees, and seemed to be on a power trip. I saw employees rolling their eyes behind his back. I had ordered one full salad and a half salad. They both were the same size. When I brought it to their attention that both were half salads, they insisted that one with the bigger bowl was the full salad."}
{"text":"The food was what I expected from Panera. The apple Fuji salad was delicious. My wife enjoyed her salad too. Although, they forgot to put dressing on her salad. When I brought it to their attention that they forgot the dressing they insisted that they did, but gave me salad dressing still. The most irritating part was that after we started to eat, they decided to clean around our table. They were cleaning the AC vent and the hanging light fixtures that were hanging above and around the table. A little consideration would be nice! Having dirt fall on you from above, and around you, is not a pleasant way to eat your food."}
{"text":"Never mind TIm hortons.this place is the best cafe .hands down.the food is fresh the coffee and Cafe selections amazing. The ambiance ,bright and  cheerful. Perfect for dates ,family get togethers business and students . relaxing and inviting.love this place."}
{"text":"Exited the interstate for the wifi, which it turns out was down. So settled for a sad, wilted and tasteless salad.  Pandora usually a more reliable pit stop. This one not worth the two minute detour."}
{"text":"Really disappointed this was no longer a Paradise Bakery.  Especially since it still says Paradise Bakery on the storefront, but everything I asked for I was told they no longer carry that.  (I was looking for the Turkey Cranberry Sandwich specifically - but couldn't find anything else I would normally order either) 
I was offered a turkey cranberry hot flatbread - well it's still over 100 degrees outside, so a hot sandwich wasn't really ideal, but I thought I'd give it a try.  I'm sorry, it was terrible.  I didn't even finish it. Whatever herb spread that was was just not something I enjoyed.  
I also wanted a lemonade, and was informed that was a summer item, and also no longer on the menu.  

I understand that Panera is apparently the parent company for Paradise Bakery - not sure if this is a new thing or not, or if all the Paradise Bakeries are losing their menu items, but if so, I'll go elsewhere. The menu items they dropped are apparently the reasons I went in there.  Also no more free cookie with my sandwich.  Kind of a bummer on top of everything else."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great to sit and chat without feeling like you have over stayed your visit. The soups are great and any of them go along well with my favorite turkey bravo sandwich.  Service was right on as they prep each sandwich to your liking. Great place to catch up with a good friend or sit by yourself and have coffee and a danish with your laptop, and or your kindle."}
{"text":"The customer service is excellent at this location, however I regret to report that I find they are usually out of their top selling products whenever I go to purchase them-my advice: bake more! 
The food however is nothing short of extravagant! It fills your body with a warmth that only home cooked food can do. The broccoli and cheddar soup is my absolute favorite soup I've tasted in my entire life. 
On an ending note, they are typically busy, so good luck finding parking, and finding seats inside can also be difficult if you go at certain times, but despite that: it is absolutely worth it! Delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is fine, but they are constantly out of things: bagels, pastries, sandwich ingredients. Be sure to have a few alternate choices in mind when ordering. And never count on cinnamon crunch bagels."}
{"text":"Everything was exactly as expected when I arrived.  The place was pretty dead when I visited however (I assume because of the incoming blizzard).  I did not experience any of the issues the previous yelpers experienced.  The music was at a perfect volume, the cashier was extremely polite, and my food came out perfect!  I would not hesitate to stop here if I'm ever in Pittsburgh again and I wouldn't be afraid to recommend it to someone else.  Keep at it Panera!"}
{"text":"This place made me so cranky! 

I came in hungover, hankering for their potato and egg quiche. Alas, I came in too late for breakfast. That sucks, but the insult to injury came in the form of the cashier's over perky suggestion of a Cobb salad because \"it has an egg in it\". Ug. Minor infraction, but as I mentioned I was hungover, so she must die!

Cheese danish was good (nice breads all together), but my  annoyance was renewed when the same perky cashier attempted to correct me \"you mean cheese pastry?\" DIE IN A FIRE!! 

Shit poor latte, served in a cappuccino cup."}
{"text":"I love going for their cinnamon crunch bagels but they always seem to be out of them. I've tried to like Panera but each time I go I'm disappointed in their food."}
{"text":"Most of the service staff are very nice. One of the cashiers even remembers my name and greets me whenever I come in. Overall, the quality of food is on par with the cost. Their chocolate pastries are absolutely delicious though, along with their orange scones. I like their soups too."}
{"text":"This location and all paneras in general is overpriced hipster bullcrap.  Unless you got a beanie on your head, skinny jeans, and a bull ring piercing in your nose, stay away."}
{"text":"We ordered breakfast on a Sunday morning and sat at our table for 20 minutes without good being delivered. We went up to check on it and they told us they were done serving breakfast and had thrown everything away. They offered lunch instead but we were in the mood for breakfast so we asked for a refund and left."}
{"text":"I have left a review for this place in the past.  Wasn't too favorable then and I must say.... things haven't changed.  If they have, it may even be worse.  
Again, no white bread for my daughter's grilled cheese sandwich.  I believe this was my complaint last time too.  How does a restaurant with \"bread\" in the name frequently run out of it?
The line to order, which had just three of us in it was extremely slow!  Getting our food was too!
The ice machine for drinks didn't work, the water cups are now just glorified dixie cups and there aren't extra napkins available without tracking down an employee to request more!"}
{"text":"I miss Paradise Bakery!  Price increase, no cookie in the kids meal.  Waited a long time for our food, the design of the restaurant doesn't flow and the servers seem confused.  We will keep going to Paradise Bakery until they've all transitioned over to Panera Bread.  The restaurant was crowded, not sure why??"}
{"text":"No cream cheese at shop !! Really ?? Can't you borrow from another till your truck comes ? Also customer service near take out window the girl there blocking the takeout containers was more worried about talking to kitchen staff than moving or helping me find right container for my needs. About 1100a 1/28/18 
Will still Going back to Panera but not this one"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. I was the only person in line and there were 4 employees behind the counter talking to each other. I stood there for awhile and nobody moved to come take my order. Finally I asked if someone could help me, they just kind of looked at me. I asked for the manager and he was one of the four behind the counter. I said, there are 4 of you, why can't someone help me. He started to tell me how one guy was supposed to be in this one area.....I Was The Only One in Line....it was 7:00 pm, they were open for two more hours. Customer service are foreign words to wthis manager and team."}
{"text":"After falling in love with the Panera Bread in Mountain View, California, I was excited to see that there is a location in Phoenix after moving here. It isn't anything like I was previously used to...not as good at all. Soup is good, but still seemed watery..I had broccoli cheddar and they do not serve French bread with soup here unlike the other ones I have visited. It was a disappointment. I love panera bread, but sadly, will not return to this one. The quality and service was also lacking."}
{"text":"We had breakfast & coffee at this location this morning (3 little kids & 2 adults)-amazing customer service and wonderful experience! Thanks Castia (sp?) for the Easter egg cookies!"}
{"text":"I honestly feel like the employees at this location are not held accountable whatsoever. I've had multiple experiences here where employees lack basic customer service skills....including witnessing a full out tantrum a couple months ago when an employee quit. But being a chain restaurant, the food was normally held to a somewhat regulated standard, but I guess not anymore. Today I was shown that's no longer the case when I waited 15 minutes and finally got a panini about the size of my pinky finger that had completely fallen apart. I guess I'll be driving across town to the other location from now on or just skipping Panera as a whole."}
{"text":"This location clearly needs a manager. The tables are always nasty and this morning it's only 8:21 and half the restaurant is empty.  They clearly don't understand supply and demand.  The soufflés are out yet again and they won't have anymore for an hour.  This is only served during breakfast people. At least the coffee wasn't out.  I love Panera coffee or I wouldn't stop here and even that loyalty is starting to wear thin."}
{"text":"Panera's generally very good, but this location is... well, not. Today, I ordered a sandwich to go (the Asiago Steak, which is normally good) but asked for no horseradish or tomato. Lo and behold, when I get home... there's horseradish and tomato. This is after they gave me chips instead of the baguette I wanted, which I managed to catch.

When you're paying $10 for a sandwich and a side, especially one made right there, I don't think that it's an unreasonable request to take off the condiments. If Subway will do it... Anyway, I've learned my lesson."}
{"text":"Over $11 for HALF a mediocre sandwich and literally a cup (16 maybe 20 oz) mac and cheese?,  do some googling on this chain.  Most expensive and despite claims food is sub par...frozen and soup is routinely mixed with old.  Drive across the street to Harris teeter.  Can probably get a full cooked chicken,soup and salad to feed the whole family for that amount!"}
{"text":"Hate to say it, but this place is now off my \"I'll always eat there\" list here in Phoenix.

Like others have said, the food is what you expect from Paradise, decent food at a decent price. Parking kind of sucks, but I drive an easy to park car, so no major complaints.

What dropped four stars off of this review was the staff. Adjectives and descriptors such as: Lazy, rude, incompetent, poorly trained, totally unmotivated, unable to take basic orders, unable to listen, possibly deft, and less organized than a poo fight in the monkey cage at the PHX zoo, all come to mind when I think of this place.

We walk in the door, and we actually had to go back and do a double take of the hours of operation because after 10 minutes of standing at the counter, no one had even looked up to see if we wanted to order something. Instead, they made it their maximum effort to avoid any and all eye contact or attempt to take an order by busying themselves cleaning up.

Mind you, it was an hour before closing time...

The lady and I went in, and we were hungry after a day of scouring Phoenix for various household needs for her new place. She ordered a Crumbly Blue Cheese salad and a cup of the tomato bisque soup. The lady tries handing her a Fuji apple chicken salad, and tries to do so in quite a rush. We explain, politely, that she didn't order that salad. The counter girl then goes into a tizzy, telling her that is what she ordered. Mind you, this would have been possible if my special lady friend WASN'T A VEGETARIAN!!!

Prior to this dropping of the proverbial ball by the obvious MENSA member behind the counter I ordered a greek salad to go with my roast beef sammich. 

Evidently being called on being less than on the ball with your menial McJob was more than this girl could handle. I got no salad, and she abruptly and rudely stomped off before I could get my order placed for the second time.

And at this point, I was over it. 

We paid for our food, sat down and ate. Neither of us were happy with our food. It tasted like yesterday's leftovers, and it was obviously hastily prepared so that the staff could get back to their cleaning duties an hour before closing time.

I hope the manager reads this and contacts me. I am not holding my breath for this though, if your employees are any indication of your level of management, its clear that the entire place needs to shut down and restaff. I suspect waiting for anyone from Paradise to contact me about this is going to be a long wait for a bus that never gonna come.

Guess the Paradise machine was broke that day?"}
{"text":"Horrible never again I ordered pick 2 a turkey avocado sandwich and a turkey apple cheddar on walnut bread with 2 drinks.  My total was 30$ . Slightly puzzled I arrived at my destination to find out the apple sandwich was soggy and I received a turkey sandwich with processed meat and Dijon mustard FOR 30 DOLLARS.

I am so frustrated I can go to several other drive thrus without the mess up.

{"text":"I love this way more than paradise bakery. Ordering is easier and the cashiers are really nice. I have seen other really rude customers come in before me, so it sets the mood for their own transaction. The ladies that have helped me have all been very nice. The food comes out fast, and is more efficient than Paradise Bakery. (:"}

And their bakery and café areas are separate, so if there's a long line at the café, and you know what you want, you can skip the line and eat at the bakery."}
{"text":"Last Sunday, at around 9 AM, I got 6 ribbon bagels at the Fox Chapel location, they were puffy and sliced evenly. They had additional trays ready to go in the racks.  Today I was at the Shadyside location.  I could only get 5 ribbon bagels and the gentleman who waited on me said he would have to make more.  (This is your special bagel this month and obviously popular, why wouldn't you have enough ready at this early in the day).  When I got home I found that these were smaller than the ones I got at Fox Chapel and they were very unevenly sliced, actually a piece of one of them was missing.  There was no one behind me in line so why couldn't a little more care been taken in slicing the bagels. Also, I had a free item coming to me and he forgot to take it off my bill, luckily I caught it.  Obviously this site isn't up  to standards.  I will go to Fox Chapel even though it is out of my way"}

Went to pick up the order the next morning and they were out of the pastry ring I ordered. I asked the manger why they were out of the pastry ring since I placed my order the day before, she stated someone bought all the pastry rings ten minutes before I got there. I said I placed my order the day before, she then stated that online orders are not received until ten minutes before the order is supposed to be ready. I said but I spoke to you about my order, she then said would you like a refund....... really, what else would I want. I wanted the damn pastry ring. Tried to speak with the district manager and he refused to call me back. DO NOT ORDER ONLINE FROM THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"It's Panera! What is not to love about it? The real reason I felt the need to review this particular location is because they bring your order to your table!!!!! I can not possibly explain how great this is being a mother of a small child. I LOVE that I do not have to leave my child at the table by herself to get our food!!! I go out of my way to go to this location."}
{"text":"Stood in line waiting for a quart of mac and cheese ($20!) and two dozen cookies for 20+ minutes. Bums in my personal space reaching over my shoulder demanding water from the cashier during checkout. I frequented Panera a lot when I lived in the midwest. It's not the same at this location. Will not return."}
{"text":"This place is going down hill. Everytime i come here they always get my order wrong. The person bringing out orders doesn't do much to help. So i just go up line where food comes out if I get my order wrong. I love their food but i guess the service is terrible."}

{"text":"What a disappointment.  We assumed Panera would be the same as Paradise Bakery. Boy were we wrong.  There were no free cookies with the sandwiches,  hardly any variety of muffins,  no boxed sets of cookies, the quality of the food was less, and even the staff wasn't as friendly.  Sadly we won't be back."}

So now I am picking items out of a salad and my other kid has no soup to eat for supper.  Can someone not look at the order taped to the bag and double check?? Very frustrating."}
{"text":"I love how close this place is! I went in there for a quick lunch and left within five minutes with a to go order. They made it quick and efficient! 
However, the lady who took my order, Jacq, definitely was having a rough day. Not once did she smile, she spoke so quickly that it was hard to hear what she was saying and did not give me any time to decide what I wanted. While I was looking at the cookies, she yelled at me saying she can take my order. No duh, but can I look real quick? I just hope someone has a better experience with her!"}
{"text":"Breakfast spot before work, loved their avocado egg white spinach sandwich! 

But it's always different when I get it, lot of time missing out on the avocado. 

Love their strawberry parfait - definitely the best I've had with its price point. But the consistency is not there, some days you get a full cup, sometimes it's only filled to the half way mark."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Panera location for four years and they have a friendly staff who put out a consistent product and really take care of their customers. My husband and I visit the location, independently or together, for breakfast, lunch, or dinner a few times a week. Recently, our online order got mistakenly placed to the Matthews location they corrected the error then gave us a discount, even though it was probably our mistake. 

The food is always fresh, ready promptly (whether eating in-store or to-go), and if they are out of an ingredient they are always up front about it. I know some of the other reviewers are upset about Panera being out of ingredients, but I'd rather know about it and they take something off their menu than serve subpar food. Try the Roasted Turkey Avacado Sandwich or the Broth Bowls, yum! Overall, great experiences and you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I want to LOVE this place, but just can't!
Sad since it's right by the house, but this location just isn't as great as the rest.
My wife went in for a bread bowl of broccoli and cheddar soup after we left Firehouse
due to the poor food quality there, and, ..wait for it ! Here comes another disappointment..
It wasn't good, she eats this constantly at every other location and LOVES it!  
Not Here!
I wanted to pick up a couple of pastries for breakfast the following morning, but I had to turn away and walk out, Flies kept landing on each and every one of them, several times!
I couldn't even order my food, I was disgusted! Still am..
This needs to be addressed, they need to keep them covered at least!
The food is far too expensive to be of such poor quality and when you get a salad-
 they only give you one, teeny tiny container of dressing, it's not near enough!"}
{"text":"Wow! I forgot why I don't go to Panera anymore. First, the girl that took care of me had zero personality, either that or hates her job. If your going to ask me questions at least  speak loud enough so i can hear you, and when you hand me my receipt don't hand it to me with a look of complete boredom on your face. I ordered a turkey bacon bravo and can't believe how the sandwich was literally thrown together. the bread was so small, as if the used a smashed loaf of bread, the dressing was oozing out the side, and they didn't even take a second to match up the way the bead lay, you know, top and bottom, Ya, minor detail...  but just adds to the apparent lack of care.  I wonder if when they make themselves a sandwich they put it together so half hazardly. I ended up taking the lettuce off because it didn't look very fresh. I won't be going back again any time soon. Spent over $8.00 on a sandwich. Too over priced for that kind of service!"}
{"text":"I Wish they had more organic options. I'm glad they are removing some unnecessary ingredients though"}
{"text":"Awesome food and really simple setting. Super clean place (though I've never been in the bathroom to let you guys know what that's like). The food is relatively healthy and always so full of flavor. Really affordable pricing as well."}
{"text":"Filthy line. You would think they would be more concerned with the appearance of the kitchen(line) sense it is visible. Its makes you question the sanitation. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The staff are poorly trained they throw the food when delivering rather than putting it nicely on the counter. Reflects poor training and that they are not equipped with dealing customer service."}
{"text":"Will come here regularly to pick food. I had continuously two positive experiences including today  with an african American employee-unfortunately  I forgot his name. Employees like him are and example of good  professionalism."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff. Came in without a voice and GABBY provided everything I needed without saying much. She didn't make me feel uncomfortable and even asked if I wanted a tea do to the fact that she picked up on the fact that I was sick almost immediately! Felt like she actually cared. What a service!"}
{"text":"My husband and I shared a sandwich the other day..it was awful! Bread was wet, wilted lettuce need I go on. There were crumbs and other things all over the floor. We won't be going back. Just thought you should know."}
{"text":"I used to come to this location on a daily basis when it was a Paradise Bakery. Since the change over the staff is rude, they never get my order right and then argue when they give me the wrong order. The food has gone down hill and gotten more expensive. Today was my last visit."}
{"text":"Great salads, nice location. Love the patio on a nice day. I can't believe they have a drive-thru, it's awesome!"}
{"text":"I love their breads and bagels. Their mini-souflees are just the right size.  They do tend to be busy in the evenings so this is my preferred place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Dirty tables, dirty bathrooms, smells like dog inside.  Overpriced fast food in questionable setting."}
{"text":"2 stars because i like the food. Service was OK, but none of the employees were happy at all. Also, coming from a chefs view, that place needs a better kept storage system, just saying. Seeing ceaser dressing caked on the pans are NOT appealing."}
{"text":"We needed a place to eat in a pinch (movie started in 30 minutes).  We hadn't been there before but the staff was very helpful at explaining the menu and prices.  Food was very fast (at our request) and pretty tasty.  Our salads were under 12.00 each but they were loaded with good stuff.  I would call it \"higher end fast food\"."}
{"text":"It's a great alternative to Starbucks.  I love their coffee and they serve good pastries as well."}
{"text":"I ordered a pick 2 lunch from this location because it's close to work and I typically enjoy Panera's food. On this occasion, however, I was really disappointed. I ordered a cup of chicken noodle soup and a BBQ chicken flatbread. 

I ordered through the Yelp app for rapid pick up with a ready time of 11:30. They must have made my order when I placed it because my soup was cold. Not just lukewarm....dead cold. In addition, it was only about 2/3 full and mostly broth. I asked for light sauce on the flatbread and they must not read instructions. My first bite a huge gob of BBQ sauce came out of the bottom and kept coming as I ate. If that was \"light\" I'd hate to see how much is \"regular\". 

Now, here's the thing. The food really did taste good. The soup was flavorful (after a stint in the microwave) and the flatbread had good flavor and tasted fresh. That's the 2 stars. Good food, horribly executed. With all of the options in a 2 block radius, I'm not likely to return."}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience I've ever had at a Panera bread. This place has truly gone down hill since the change from paradise bakery. Besides the dirty silverware and serving dishes, most of the tables were sticky, dirty and had no one sitting at them. Just seemed rather filthy and not much selection of a clean table. Don't even ask the staff for anything unless you want a snide stare and no help."}
{"text":"I usually LOVE Panera.  We were on our way up to Mooresville and stopped to get take out from this Panera.  I was disappointed because they royally screwed up our order.   I didn't realize it until we were back on the highway heading to our appointment.  Not cool!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent & fast, finding a place to sit was not a problem and I love the crusty bread with the French onion soup!"}
{"text":"I am a regular at this Panera Bread, I have been for years. The new manager is rude, to her employees and to the customers."}
{"text":"So far, I'm pleased!
Panera Bread is a great place for the most important meal of the day~(breakfast!) and lunch!
Friendly service, and a fair amount of items on the menu to choose from. You can do combos or just pick one thing to your fancy. Bread, soups, pasta, sandwiches, and panini's, all cozy wholesome foods. 
I ordered the cuban chicken panini with baked chips on the side, my friend ordered soup in a bread bowl with a side of apples. Both were decently sized and tasty!
This place gets very busy on the weekend, lots of families come here after their games for lunch. Lot's of seating available, booths and tables, and some couches too. So its a good place to hang out with friends and even study.
It would be nice if the seating area could be maintained better though. Having to sit on  breadcrumbs and on the table wasn't that great, but its a small fault.
Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Constantly amazed by how fast they get the food out to tables - and I've never yet had an order be wrong or even substandard!

Tasty, fresh, good value, free wi-fi ... it's on my favorites list!

Especially fond of the Steak & Bleu Cheese salad - I'm amazed they can get the steak that tender in a salad!"}
{"text":"My blood started to boil.  I felt that all-too-familiar feeling of rage set in. \"Calm yourself woman!  You can NOT give that person the finger. You are on TV, and it would be terrible for your career.\" I chanted this to myself, over and over again as I gripped the steering wheel until my knuckles turned white. 
 
A blue Nissan Versa cut me off, and pulled between those two precious white parking lines with ease.  I couldn't believe it.  I had spent a good 8 minutes driving around, trying to find a parking space! Everybody else is right.  Parking here in nearly impossible at lunchtime. 

The rest of the review is necessary. This Panera is like most other Paneras I've been to.  Efficient service, busy at lunch, tasty lunch options. I like how the calorie counts are on the menu board. 

Even so: you better be punching those menu items into your MyFitnessPal app first, before buying.  A pumpkin muffin can set you back almost 600 calories, and a half turkey sonoma panini will eat up over 21 grams of fat! Hmm, I like to think the apple as a side helps counteract some of those scary numbers. 

Anyway, I enjoy Panera when I have a little more time at midday. The folks who work here are friendly, and I always leave satisfied and ready to get back to work."}
{"text":"Of course, Panera Bread is awesome, as usual. This Panera has the rapid order line with kiosks to order your food and skip the line! Plus they have a table navigator they give you when you do order at the counter. The navigator tells the staff where you are sitting and they deliver the food to you. This was very different from most other Panera's I have visited in past. I love this feature because I was dining with my young child. This eliminates me having to go get the food during a busy lunch hour and leave her alone at the table. Of course the food was so yummy, as it always is. The staff was also very friendly. I love Panera to begin with, but I will definitely be back to this Panera location solely based on all the convenience and technology in this store."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice. Not happy with your service. I have worked in the food industry before. Your team needs to know the items on the menu in order to assist customers with orders and that was not the case for me.  You also need to improve on directing your customers on where to pick up their food. you cannot assume that your customers are regulars and know what to do. I ordered a latte and it took me over five minutes to figure out I had to go get it myself. It was never called out. You also need to greet customers as they come in even if you are busy. As a manager, courtesy requires you to STOP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND ASSIST CUSTOMERS FIRST...especially when there is a cue of people waiting to place orders. The food is great but I don't care to eat there if your service is not. I'm going to give it one last shot. And believe me I will comment on it, if there is no change. If you are bringing your business to my city you need to bring great service along with it."}
{"text":"They are always out of what I order. The last three times they've been out of avacados, soup, and this time was Caesar dressing. Rediculous!"}
{"text":"I love Panera! The people are friendly and although they are a high volume, I've always found a seat and enjoyed my lunch. Don't like their coffee though."}
{"text":"The cookies are pretty here. I like to come here and make pretend I was in the mood for something else so I can act surprised because the sandwiches are so yummy!"}
{"text":"Ava and Corbin really took great care of me tonight. They have wonderful customer service!
I had a Strawberry, Poppy , Chicken Salad and it was delicious! Thank you."}
{"text":"This place was good. Fast service. Half sandwich half soup is the way to go. Reasonbly priced."}
{"text":"This is the second time in less than a month that I have ordered my usual tomato and mozzarella flat Bread and the mozzarella cheese was so little i couldn't find it on the sandwich!  At these prices I expect to get a great sandwich EVERY time."}
{"text":"Have been there twice since the colossus location open. Customer service is really poor, the guy wear glasses looks like the manager, and he was throwing keys to the ceiling  in front of me cuz he was boring, this kind of people can be a manager? Give me a break! And I order a bread to go, he give me a clear plastic bag for it, is that suppose to be a Paper bag? I feel like I am buying left over stuff."}
{"text":"I only like and can order a handful of dishes from their menu as I'm vegetarian however I do enjoy their food. I dislike this location as it can get super crowded and loud. Definitely can't study here because there's usually a dozen other ppl doing the same and the wifi is unbearably slow. 

I enjoy their black bean soup in a bread bowl as well as their French onion soup. Their Mediterranean veggie sand which always tastes fresh and is one of my favourites. I LOVED their mozzarella and tomato panini until they recently turned it into a flatbread which wasn't a very successful change as the pesto just leaks out and makes the bread a soggy mess. I'm hoping they bring it back.

Some of their food can be overpriced as well. I order two things and I'm paying $15 for lunch automatically, so order wisely."}
{"text":"I'd give them a five for food, but a 3 for customer service. Our cashier was Kellie jo and she was so polite and warm and friendly. She gets a 5! However, as we were standing in line, Robin was open at the cashier next to her and had no customers as she stood there and did not ask to help us while Kellie was busy with another customer. When it was our turn to be waited on by kellie, Robin then turned around and talked with another employee. Other than that, kellie needs a raise and i will come back, if she's working. The food, however is always wonderful and makes my taste buds want more."}
{"text":"Grateful for a healthy option that I can take the kids to. This is a definite step up from Paradise Bakery that was previously here. The food is better quality and you can tell the giant cookies have much better ingredients than the old ones. reason for 4 star is that it can be messy here during busy times. Overall, a good option."}
{"text":"I always come here and the food is good, but this afternoon I found hair at the bottom of the bowl in my turkey chili. Let management know asked if I wanted seconds, no thank you."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  I first started going to this in the States before it came to Canada and always looked forward to it.  I nearly fell off my bike when I first saw it had come to Toronto on Yonge St.  
The brocoli and cheese soup is my favourite and their chai tea latte is best I've ever had.  They also make awesome sandwiches,  Greek salad and smoothies.  I pretty much haven't tried something I haven't enjoyed.  If you haven't gone here yet then you're seriously missing out.  
Oh and forgot to mention their bakery section....  The brownies are a chocoholics dream.  So delicious.  I'm a fan of the cinnamon buns too.  :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the service was great but today the gal at the drive thru had a huge smile on her face almost laughing and we were kind of wondering why..well I had a live fly in the middle of my salad. Very very disgusting especially knowing I ate alot of the salad before I discovered the fly crawling around."}
{"text":"We came in for Saturday brunch and it was not really a pleasant experience even placing our order, they were not helpful at all (not friendly customer service)"}
{"text":"Would you eat this nasty a** lettuce on your sandwich?? Sick and tired of getting this quality of food from the Panera Bread in Gastonia. I have received this in my salad also :("}
{"text":"Usually a good experience here but today I felt compelled to post a particularly bad experience.  

This is now the second time we've been here when they have run out of yogurt for the kids menu.  First time okay, second time I'm like.....just take yogurt off the menu!  It's 11 am .... Did you have a rush of kids at 9 am?! 

Then we get the peanut and butter sandwich and it looks like my toddler made it.  Now it's my fault for ordering the sandwich (part of me thinks what did you expect) but when you see it all you can think is how sad it looks.  I mean cut it into shapes or something....use a smaller plate...Do something!!!!  And for $4.59 + tax?  Shoulda gone to McDonald's for a $3.99 happy meal.   AND it doesn't include a drink either.  WOW.  To top it off they gave me a whole apple with it but was reluctant to cut it up for my 18 month old.   REALLY?!  

So I did this so you wouldn't have to!  Don't order the kids pb&j sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place only gets one $, it's $10 for a basic sandwich. You could go to the grocery store, buy artisan bread and fresh cut lunch meat and cheese for a group of people at the same price. The food was good, the service was nice, I have nothing negative to say about any of that. Just the pricing for premade food is bothersome. I'll go to the deli down the street and get a hearty sub or sandwich made from a local place for $6."}
{"text":"This place is totally over rated, over priced, and just horrible.  I had lunch there this past Saturday with my Son,  Michael and his two girls. They chose the place to eat, if it was my decision it would have been a locate family business  not some yuppie think we're cool place. Yes I called it a yuppie hang out. You first walk in and order from a tablet, really in personal.  We all ordered a soup and grill cheese sandwich.  It's self serve on the drinks. We walked up to the different beverages and one of the tea dispensers was leaking all over counter on to the floor. Michael  tried to bring it to their attention but they seemed indifferent to the problem.  We found a table that didn't have dirty plates from previous customers and wiped down. The place was not very clean and upon walking to the men's bathroom there was this room with cleaning items including dirty smelling mop wide open next to where people were eating. A few feet away from that is the men's bathroom.  I could smell it before I even entered. If I was at a dive bar the bathroom wouldn't be such a surprise.  It reeked so bad I turned around walked out. Again I tried to bring the bathroom situation but again I was pretty much got the same indifference as the tea dispenser. 

Now the service, the food at least was serviced on a timely matter,  but the soup and sandwiches were luke warm. They're okay but I would expect more for the price. Yes again another problem,  one of the girls didn't get their order. We asked our server and you looked at us with a puzzled look on his face  and replied, oh I'm sorry what was it? We told him it was a child's grill cheese plate. She did get her plate, but it was missing the chips and yogurt squeeze packet. Plus one side of the sandwich wasn't toasted.  This place was a total disappointment,  from lack of cleanliness,  poor service,  and disappointing overpriced food. I would expect more for the price of $45. 

I would never recommend this place at all. Stop by Frys and get your cheese, bread , and a can of soup. It will be better and cheaper,  seriously!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I used to eat at Panera at least once a week for a long time.  However,  over the last couple of years we noticed a severe decline in customer service and especially the quality of the food.  We pulled back on frequency of our visits due to these factors and other dining options.  We've probably been there twice in the last 6 months with so-so experiences.  At the urging of our sons,  my husband and I ventured in again for lunch.  BIG MISTAKE!!!!  First of all,  it wasn't very busy.  Secondly,  our cashier was nice but as we found out Very Incompetent.  Every one of our orders was prepared wrong.  That's 100% for the bad.  Unbelievable.  If that wasn't enough we waited 15 minutes to get the wrong  order and had to wait an additional 10 minutes for the re-make.  The quality and consistency wasn't there.  Also,  there was no management roaming around at all to greet us or listen to our displeasure.  We spent $48.00 for HORRIBLE food.  On top of that,  all 4 of us were stricken with severe stomach issues (I'll leave it at that) as a remainder of our horrible lunch.  I am utterly disappointed.  Panera has seen the last of us I'm sooty to say.  R.I.P.  Panera."}
{"text":"Do not use their Rapid order application...
Not only do they ignore the order, they are rude and show absolutely no customer service once they are made aware of their oversight"}
{"text":"The food is so delicious! And I can't believe what great service they have! The young lady who took my order was fast and didn't miss anything. I'm sad that paradise is gone but panera is the same company so they have the same food and I'm not disappointed at all. I love the Paradise cookies so I'm glad they still have them but I'm a little upset that they no longer have the pasta salad anymore. I did try the Chinese citrus salad and it was so delicious I would definitely get it again. Also they have a better rewards program than paradise so I will for sure be going back soon!!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food. I absolutely love the quinoa lentil soup. It has the best flavor! I'm a little disappointed about serving sizes. I ordered the soup to go and when I got home it was about 1/2 a cup. I've also ordered half of sandwich and when I got home to eat it there was approximately 1 Tbs of tuna on the bread. 
I hope those situations were out of the ordinary and not the standard practice for orders that are \"to go\"."}
{"text":"Don't go In this place after the dinner crowd. They don't clean up. Messy tables, trash everywhere."}
{"text":"I've seen the largely negative reviews regarding this place and yet I'm a fan. For a bakery and sandwich shop, however, that is their weakness. They have some tasty and filling egg white breakfast sandwiches and a good salad selection. The medium salad also comes with a nice piece of crusty bread. The loyalty program is generous as well. Best thing is the Rapid Order they offer via website or phone app. Ten minutes after I order I can walk in and my order is waiting for me in a special section. Always ready and have never had a mistake on the order. For some reason I've also earned a free bagel for every day in the month of July."}
{"text":"The rapid pickup service is not on par. Two days in a row, our orders were not ready in the 10 minute timeframe causing me to wait. The point of this service is quickness and it's failed twice in a row."}
{"text":"I've never done a review on yelp before but I just had to for this. The food was up to par with any other Panera I've ever been to but it is the staff that makes me give this review. I took my little brother in there and he ordered a mac n cheese bread bowl. We seated ourselves close to the area where the food is put out. When they received my brothers order 3 of the staff members started making fun of it, saying \"obesity in a bowl\" and \"they're going to need to hit the gym after that\" and \"they couldn't wait to see who ordered this\". My brother heard them say this and was visibly upset. He was too embarrassed to go get his food so I got it for him. I will not be returning to this location and find it rather insulting that the staff would ridicule a 11 year old kids order."}
{"text":"This is my favorite morning spot to relax, drink coffee and/or get work done.  It's quiet, clean and has big tables to spread out.  Also, the staff is always pleasant, even at the ungodly hour of 6:00 a.m.

Foodwise, their soup, bagels and salads are pretty good -- even for a chain. I particularly like the tomato soup, it tastes nothing like Campbells!  I'm fairly certain, however, that a regular Panera diet will give you diabetes-- those pastries are calorific!"}
{"text":"This is my first updated review not knowing how to use the feature before.

We had another book club event here. I did not know what to get so went with bagel and cream cheese and coffee. It was $5.44. The former is hard to screw up or excel at unless the bagel was amazing but in this case it was not. However, it was perfectly adequate.

Now coffee is $2.15 (if I recall) which is a little expensive but it is fresh and you get free refills. I like the hazelnut. There is also a beverage dispenser (a better term escapes me) where you can get an assorted mix of juice combo drinks. I believe it is unsweetened which is a nice bonus for those watching sugar levels.

They let you lounge around and play boards game there as well.

Everyone else seem to enjoy their meals.

3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times due to its convenient location and have gotten the chipotle chicken and the smokehouse turkey panini. The latter with chips (not fries, chips) and an iced lemonade. The option of fries over chips would have been nice. I've also gotten the iced lemonade by itself another time and it wasn't as good as the first time. 

The food was decent but I found everything here a tad overpriced relative to the quality/portion.

Tim Horton's now offers iced lemonade which I've yet to try but at a dollar a cup it's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"If you want your food quickly, this is not the place to go. Time and time again the wait has been excessive. I am currently waiting for my food now...it has been over 15 min. There are not that many people here so I am truly confused as to why it takes so long. I ordered a Fontagia Chicken Sandwich. 

The food here is expensive and is sometimes sloppily put together. - the other Panera in Mentor is MUCH better."}
{"text":"Agree with above review.  Terrible customer service.  Was not acknowledged by anyone at the take-out area because all employees were carrying on a personal conversation.  Order included chicken noodle soup as in 3 noodles with broth. Was there late afternoon so I'm sure the soup was fine at lunchtime but not when I got there.  Will not return and will take my business across the street to Wildflower."}
{"text":"I find myself back at a Panera every couple of years-- and continue to be underwhelmed with the restaurant side. The menu remains complex. The food lacking in quantity and flavor. My vegetable soup with pesto today had overcooked barely identifiable vegetables. The broth was water flavored. The pesto may have been the green specks but was otherwise undetectable.  I leave feeling cheated and dissatisfied. 
Positives: Managed well enough.
The bakery items are nice even if overpriced."}
{"text":"Panera Bread itself, being a chain is nothing too special. It`s one of the better chains, yes and they do have a lot of choice, but nothing tastes spectacular. It's great for what it is. I'm only giving this particular location 4 stars because of their EXCELLENT service despite it being reallyyy busy. Service is very fast and efficient, yet the staff still remains friendly, patient and even funny! Also lots of seating options (additional seating upstairs). Oh yeah, and I also like that they bring the food to you.

The last time I went, it was particularly busy and I was trying to find a seat with a plug for my laptop, but my food had already come out and 2 of the servers walked around the whole place looking for me lol"}
{"text":"I'm gonna give my rating based on the customer service and food for this one but will get to why I lost a star.

Let me say, I pretty much have my standard Panera order. Sometimes I get a bit crazy and mix it up with a new soup flavor or add the extra pastry for 99 cents if I am feelin real saucy...but I always get a turkey sandwich and caesar salad because it's just always good!  Also, side note: if you ask for an extra piece of crusty bread, they will always oblige. 

Now for the minus star.

The wifi is pretty terrible. Very spotty and hard to connect. 

This place will remain a great place to eat and socialize while I stuff turkey sandwich and salad down my pie hole."}
{"text":"First off I'm glad Oakmont has a PANERA...it's a great addition to the community..but 2 days ago I had to leave without ordering after observing one of their staff who was at the register and serving food who was obviously very sick..cold,flu whatever..constantly wiping the nose which was visibly dripping!..this employees hands had an exposed bandage and the whole scene just turned me off so much I said to the person behind me \"good luck\" and left..minutes ago I tried to call the manager and after being on hold for nearly 4 minutes just gave up!...I hope PANERA reads these YELP reviews and takes note...Oakmont you ain't doing too good..get better!..The location AND that employee who should have been sent home...PS Hope your registers counters etc are disinfected on a regular basis..but what do you do if this sick employee services the coffee bar...disinfect each pack of sugar?.."}
{"text":"Some of the worst food I've had in a really long time. I ordered a half cashew chicken salad and yet it didn't have even one cashew. The chicken was flavorless and the dressing cup was less than a quarter full of dressing. I also ordered the half turkey bacon avocado sandwich and part of the outside of the avocado stem was in the sandwich. Gross feeling to bite down on that. Plus, for a half sandwich, half salad, and drink it cost almost $17!!! Don't waste your time or money here!"}
{"text":"Just ate at Panera in Allison Park, have not been there in over a year, and was hoping it improved. It did not improve. We both ordered the steak and white cheddar panini. The steak on both was ice cold and cheese not melted. We had to take them back, after they reheated them, Still not much better. Waste of money."}
{"text":"This panera bread is by far the worst one I've ever been to. The reason I say this is because the service is awful and slow. I live right by this panera and was super excited it opened, but it has been a huge disappointment. There have been times where I have waited 15-20 minutes because they simply forgot to make my order.

The employees always seem to be oblivious to customers waiting for their food and take their sweet time while chatting it up with one another.  Not to mention the quality of food isn't as good as other panera's. I usually get the mac and cheese and its completely hit or miss. Its either overcooked or undercooked every time. Not to mention that I found a piece of a plastic bag in the mac and cheese from the bag that they heat it up in. 

Bottom line is that if you love panera skip going to this one. It will honestly only make your opinion of the brand much worse."}
{"text":"This Panera is the closest to where I live and I will start actively avoiding it. The service is slow, terrible, and on average it takes 15-20 minutes for a to-go order to be completed. Also, if you go there on a Saturday might as well forget about it. They do not know how to manage orders, and its even more disorganized than usual (if that's even possible). 

And with regard to the food, every time I order a sandwich its poorly made and falls apart immediately. Indicating that the employees care little about quality."}
{"text":"Love the French toast bagel and the soups. Had a great lunch today!"}
{"text":"I Usually love Panera but this location just doesn't listen. Went there this morning and my eggwhite, avocado, and Swiss on sesame bagel came out as eggwhite, tomato, spinach on sesame toast. I repeated it to her 3 times..."}
{"text":"OMG!! I read some of the reviews on here but that didn't stop me from experiencing this place for myself.  I'm from Portland,  Or and we have Panera there but I have never went in but have always wanted to. I tried it for the first time today and trust me they did not disappoint!!! I had a broccoli cheddar bread bowl and a Fiji apple chicken salad half sized with a frozen lemonade!!! Can we say yumsters?! I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Expensive + regrettable experiences on 9am Sunday mornings when it's not busy.

Visit #1, not all of order arrived. Had to ask where is the muffin we ordered, told it's on it's way. Had to ask a 2nd time, then they needed to confirm which muffin was ordered because they forgot.

Visit #2, our food part of the order came but not the hot drinks. Waited for 10 minutes before asking, said the drinks will be coming soon. 5 minutes later I had to ask again, turns out the drinks were made a while ago so instead of hot drinks, they were warm."}
{"text":"The employee by the name of Scotty was very rude and did not get our order right.   Thumbs down for this location....way down!"}
{"text":"This Panera is awe-some.When I first found out that there was a Panera bread near my girlfriend's house I thought \"great , a place to get some of my favorite coffee without cutting into my retirement savings portfolio.\" Then it dawned on me that I was going to be able to get some of my favorite coffee without having to let someone else pour it for me. A lightbulb went off when I then after my previous realizations , figured out that I would be able to mix half dark roast and half hazelnut for a coffee that I have named \"the kev\" only negative feedback is that Pbread is overcharging for cream cheese .it is insane. Love Pbread."}
{"text":"nothing special to write about. service just so so, food just OK and WiFi horrible. but maybe that's the way they want it. would NOT return to this one. too bad no corner bakery nearby"}
{"text":"No marshmallows in their SIGNATURE hot chocolate ...at least not for three more days according to the hostess ...how is that possible ...what bothers me is they were going to pass it off on me without telling me ...very sneaky ...more important the marshmallows make the confection sweet ...so it was a little bitter ...that's what happens when you leave out an ingredient ...poor form Panera!"}
{"text":"Been here before, brought my kids; felt overpriced and underwhelmed. Son got Mac & Cheese as a highlight for birthday and the portion was a joke. We also got the Citrus salad, but it felt as though they poured the syrup from canned peaches all over the salad, way too sweet to enjoy, My sandwich, the hot special of the day, wasn't that special. $50 for the family was over the top.

Not going back"}
{"text":"Wish I could do zero starts.

I am not surprised to see so many 1-2 starts here. Employees at this place have not learned basics of good customer service. My order was incorrect and when asked to fix, the person who was supposed to make the sandwich totally ignored it. Waited 15 minutes, went back to the counter and he acted surprised that I was waiting. I told them to forget about it and left the place. 

Not going back ever !"}
{"text":"Constantly forget an ingredient and when a person lets you know you missed an ingredient in your salad you filled my entire salad with just one ingredient as a joke. Way to ruin someones meal that they paid for. Worst experience."}
{"text":"Food is fine; your typical Paradise/Panera offerings with fresh made sandwiches and salads.  This rating reflects the customer service.  The thing is, teally terrible customer service by only one employee can ruin your entire experience.    Melinda was dismissive and downright rude during my checkout experience after I made an inquiry about how the rewards would be credited since the system was down.  She then proceeded to stare me down as I dined with my five year old the entire time we were there.  It was pretty incredulous.  The manager was pleasant and empathetic when I let her know about how her employee was acting but I'll stick with Lucy's when in this neighborhood again."}
{"text":"They herded me to a computer to place my own order and pay the second I walked in.  That was such a turn-off!    The whole time I was there I felt like I was eating in a snack bar at a crowded airport.  

The Greek salad was decent, the chicken Caesar had much less chicken than it did when it was Paradise Bakery last time we were at same location. My daughter was disappointed. The cookies we self-ordered at the computer were not available (one out of stock, the other looked nothing like what I had ordered on the picture menu) so we had to get up and choose others.  You would think their computer would \"know\" if they have the cookies in stock or not before it allows the order to be placed!

Employees running everywhere, looking confused, talking loudly, trying to figure out which table had which order by using GPS on the tables.  NOT a relaxing lunch AT ALL, so we won't be back."}
{"text":"I ordered a catered lunch for a company meeting and they gave me a salad with brown wilted spoiled lettuce.  The pickles looked like they were recycled.  I will never order from them again!"}
{"text":"Love this place .me and my wife visit everyweek this place, there breads are always fresh, bagels are my favourite,,"}
{"text":"Because I typically love panera bread, I've given this particular location many chances. All to end in the slowest possible service, and the staff always forgetting items or messing an order up. I like to come to panera for faster than restaurant service, but obviously not fast food. For how busy this place is during lunch on the work week, they need better staff to make things more efficient. Not great management here as far as I have seen in my many visits. Will choose other places in the area for lunch in the future"}
{"text":"I really like Panera for their convenience. I find most of their food to be just okay but I continue to return as I really like their mac and cheese and their lemonade."}
{"text":"While quality has declined over the many years I've eaten here lately the attitude has deteriorated as well.  We did fast pickup on 3 orders today.  The order didn't look right to the one who picked it up and he asked for it to be verified.  The person did so begrudgingly and said everything was correct.  In fact we were missing one side, one sandwich was totally incorrect and the other sandwich was almost inedible.  Then when I wanted to just email the location and explain how disappointed I was there is no readily apparent email address available.  It seems a shame when they had such good product and service a few years ago."}
{"text":"Cookies - YES. Other food - Forget it. The meat and toppings are the same quality as Subway. Save your money and do not buy the overpriced poor quality sandwiches that can be purchased elsewhere for much less."}
{"text":"Called to make sure they have enough bread bowls. Spend $70. The cashier confirmed they do. Then guess what. They are short one. On a rainy day they should expect to sell a few extra."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch the other day and was fairly underwhelmed.  The food wasn't terrible, but the price to quality ratio was quite high and the food overall was uninspiring.  Also, I wasn't asked what side I wanted with my sandwich and was just given a bag of chips...oh well.  The baked goods and breakfasts looked pretty good, and I've enjoyed this in the past, but as far as the lunch goes I don't plan on going back anytime soon as much more innovative options can be had in the area for the same price or less."}
{"text":"When you order actual food from this panera bread, please, watch their hands.  I ordered two breakfast sandwiches, and the man making my sandwich; while keeping his gloves on, picked something up off the floor, put his hands in cleaning water, pulled out a towel, cleaned a counter, and then took my sandwich from the warmer, and put them in the paper sleeve.  He never took his gloves off, washed his hand , and put a new set of gloves on to ensure my food properly arrived to me.  My money was returned,  but how many other people received dirty sandwiches.  I just can not give them anymore than one star.  All the fake smiles in the world does not equate to my health."}
{"text":"First time at Pamela Bread and was quite disappointed. The staff was not attentive talking about school while we were trying to order. The Chipotle Chicken Avocado Pannini was good but not hot. Very pricey and probably not worth the price. 
Will pass on it next time. Much better value & service at other restaurants."}
{"text":"I ordered the strawberry poppy seed and chicken salad. When my husband brought it to our table, I was surprised to see blueberries and pineapple chunks mixed in with a few strawberries. I looked at the menu board to make sure I wasn't going crazy. Nope, no mention of other said fruit. So my guess is they were trying to be stingy with the strawberries and filled the void with other fruit. I was starving and didn't go up to complain. I picked out the pineapple and ate it with just the strawberries and blueberries. I will order the salad again and if it is a repeat of what I had, I will definitely complain.  Make sure you know what you are getting."}
{"text":"Always slow service.  Staff never in a hurry. 

I like Panera in general, wish this wasn't the one close to me."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick breakfast. Lots of healthy choices at a reasonable price and service was quick. I would make it my regular breakfast stop."}
{"text":"I peeked into my take-out bag and realized they forgot all of the sides for my sandwiches so I had to run back in to get those... Sure wish I would have taken a closer look at my food... All 4 sandwiches burnt, rock hard and barely edible...such a bummer"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot; never had a problem; good food.  The bagels are really good."}
{"text":"way too over priced! small mac n cheese is $5. HALF a salad is $6 a SMALL drink is $2.50 RIDICULOUS! i don't recall Paradise being this expensive. overall a lunch for 2 was $30. although the salad was good, i could've bought a bigger size somewhere else for the same price!"}
{"text":"I dunno, man. I just dunno. 

Frankly, I hate reviewing a chain because, in theory, they're all supposed to be the same. But every once in a while, there are specific aspects that differentiate one from other and they're worth noting.

I echo the previous review that commented on the layout of the store. I get that they're trying keep some of the elements centralized because customers could be entering from a few different sides of the store, but the whole ordering area is very dense, especially considering the amount of space they have.

My main issue, though, is the wifi. I don't know whether or not it's fair to review a restaurant based on something like wifi, but when you're a sandwich shop on a college campus and provide gobs and gobs of seating, I think it's pretty safe to say they've rolled out the welcome mat for people with computers. The first time I was at this location, I needed to change seats 4 times to try to find a stronger signal. I get that restaurants are for eating in, not for computing from, but this is ridiculous.

As for the food... I mean, it's fine. I think all Paneras benefit from being \"not McDonalds\" or \"not Chipotle,\" but at the end of the day, the food is just fine. Nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Panera. I love the pick any 2. I always by the Bacon Turkey Bravo & the French onion soup when available. This experience at this particular location was different then my other times at Panera because there was this guy I didn't catch his name but I came in at around 6:30pm on February 3rd & he was running food & bussing tables, but his work ethic was phenomenal. I am a waitress & I observed how he was attentive to every customer & even to me when I asked for my soup to be heated up a little hotter. When he was bussing tables he even went above & beyond to clean up the floor with a towel after a family with three kids had left. I always appreciate good employees with a good help review so that their management knows when their employees are doing a amazing job. 

Update: (06.04.16) at around 7:30
Came here again and once again the staff is excellent! From the lady behind the register to the nice young man running food and bussing plates from tables. He was very good at his job and deserves praise from management! He was very attentive and walked around ensuring everyone was okay and plates were cleared off from people who were sitting! I wish I caught his name."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their food and bread obviously, very clean and friendly atmosphere. Employees really pay attention to customers a huge detail for me is when I asked for my food give me my stencils! Napkins and everything is needed without asking for it. Common sense. Thank you Panera for the great customer service."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this location. The service is terribly slow. I've gone in there twice now and ordered soup and waited 30 minutes both times for it to come out."}
{"text":"I have been going to Panera for years and have always had a pleasant experience. At This place, however, I found a HAIR in my soup. Disgusting. Didn't seemed overly alarmed either..."}
{"text":"Really, Panera? You can only redeem one rewards offer at a time? If I wasn't in such a hurry I would have cancelled part of my order, got back in line and redeemed my second offer.  I'm at Panera a lot - sometimes multiple times a day for business meetings - so don't make it difficult for your best customers.  I'll be looking for other locations for my meetings."}
{"text":"Order entered under wrong number. Gave a pathetic sorry and did nothing else to accommodate."}
{"text":"Like the food, but for the 4th time in a row, they are out of bread. Isn't bread in their name?  No bread bowls or baguettes by 8:00 PM. Don't stay open this late if you are going to consistently run out  of food. 

\"UPDATE\"
Been about a month, since I gave up on the bakery that is always out of bread. Daughter really wanted it, so here we are. Guess what?  THEY ARE OUT OF BREAD!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for a nice simple, yet tasty lunch. The you-pick-two special is a favorite of mine. I usually pair the broccoli cheddar soup with the fuji apple chicken salad. But any combination of their soups, salads and sandwiches are sure to satisfy. The french baguettes are my choice of side and are very nice for sopping up left over soup at the bottom of the bowl. The atmosphere is nice. There is also free wifi, so you can hang around and get some work done.

And I dare you to resist adding a delicious cookie/pastry to your meal. For only $0.99 more, you can give that baked good a new home. In your tummy."}
{"text":"Check your order! It's a rare time here when there isn't something amiss. 

This is why I never use the online ordering. We got burned too many times at the Harvard and Richmond location for me to even try it again. 

And I have to echo the wifi complaints--not reliable at all."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery is one of our favorite places to eat, and whenever we are in Phoenix we try and stop since Tucson only has one, and it is way across town.  This is the most convenient location for us to stop at, but it seems like half the time we try and stop they aren't open. We went up for a friends birthday in April and were craving Paradise Bakery; we stopped but were not able to get out due to a massive swarm of bees outside the restaurant ( I realize this is not their fault, just a disappointment.) Another time we had just flown in from vacation and wanted a quick dinner before the drive home. We got there to find out they had just closed at 8pm...and it wasn't even a Sunday. It seems like they need to change their hours, we were not the only customers they turned away that night because they closed so early."}
{"text":"I had ordered a turkey sandwich a coffee and a small tomato soup. The sandwich was super tiny.. it was in fact a whole sandwich and not a half..  for all of this it was 19 dollars.. wtf?  For this price I could have eaten at carrabas across the street... the food I ordered was not bad though except for the fact that the sizes of the food are really small here. For a slim to average male in my 20s... it did not fill me up. Aside from some what liking the food, I thought the coffee here was not very good. Tasted very watered down. Also I watched them make the coffee... they use the crappy milk, the cheapest kind you can buy..... so yeah not very impressed overall. Aaand I'm out an entire 20 dollars for just 1 person... no thanks...."}
{"text":"Panera bread ain't got shit on Paradise Bakery!!  I know there's a bunch of bums in the area but the bathrooms were on lockdown.   The cookies aren't buy one get one free. They don't have the best salad ever which is the southwest chicken Caesar!    I hope paradise bakery doesn't turn into this craphole!  Never going back"}
{"text":"Order at the  kiosk they screw up your order, have your taken by the cashier they screw it up. How difficult is it to read a ticket???? The person that  pre-checks orders before delivery to your table can't read either.  3 strikes and won't be returning"}
{"text":"I'm really over this place. Walked in at 12:30, the prime of lunch hour. Wanted a bagel. That's it. There is a small line at the pastry/bagel register and a long line at the main registers. I get in the pastry line... where a woman is ringing people out. She tells me I have to get into the other line. WHY does this place have ONE register going at lunch. And WHY is this women having a line form at her register if she's not actually using it? I keep giving them chances but I'm always disappointed. I'm officially done."}
{"text":"I ordered a soup and grilled cheese with tomato and bacon. By far the absolute WORST sandwich I have ever seen. I did not eat it. There was maybe 1 slice of cheese, the tomato was rotten and the bacon was raw.   I'm just about over panera, it's overpriced anyways."}
{"text":"I have been numerous times since they've opened this location.  I've been to American locations and while this one is a little more cramped than I'm used to, I've found the service to be just as good.

The girls behind the counter were very helpful in making suggestions and patient while I thought about what I was going to order.  One even reminded me that I had a free baked good if I wanted to use that as I was contemplating a dessert.

The prices are a little high, but with the Urban Eatery opening at the Eaton's Centre, it's all a matter of time when we start paying more for everything.  Sandwiches are absolutely delicious and the salads are to die for.  And what is great is that you can get a half salad and half sandwich which are actually big enough to fill you up for a whole meal, plus you get a bag of chips or an apple as a side.

I also love how spacious the upstairs is and how if you want private seats you can be nestled in a corner but if you have a large group there are large tables for people to sit at.  Perfect for studying or doing work, as there is free wifi and a very relaxing and comfortable atmosphere around you.

I couldn't be happier that they've opened up on Yonge St. and plan on making repeat visits."}
{"text":"I used to like it here. But the store is dirty. No clean tables. The bathroom is out of toilet paper and desperately in need of a cleaning. My soup has soggy tortilla chips. Now I know why I don't come here anymore."}
{"text":"Not very good service. This morning after ordering coffee we find that there is no fresh coffee in there brewing beakers. When we did get our coffee it was cold. At least they had a smile on there face.

Poor attitude."}
{"text":"I had an awful experience here.  It took the cashier 5 minute to punch my order into the cash register, then wasted another couple of minutes explaining to me that they changed their menu and its all \"screwed up\".  After waiting another 10 minutes for my latte, I finally asked the lady behind the counter if the coffee was going to take much longer because I was in a hurry.  She looked at me with a snare , didn't say a word, then instructed the cashier to refund my money...which I didn't ask for.  As the cashier handed me my refund I said \"I didn't ask for a refund, I just wanted to know how long it was going to take\".  They both just stared at me without a word, so I said, \"fine.  I find coffee elsewhere\".  As I was walking out she declared to the customers in line with a giggle \"she DID ask for her money back!'  I will not be going back here."}
{"text":"45 min wait for a to-go order. I walked in to place a to-go order at 11:30.  I left at 12:15. 25 + parties were waiting for their \"paid\" orders.  They must have had missing personnel today. I like Panera, but this was not a good effort."}
{"text":"Honestly I rarely right reviews but I just can't take it anymore. The WORST panera ever. The last 5 times I've been in they are out of everything... From bagels (by 930am!!!!) to coffee carriers... To BUTTER! The employees are slow, confused and not logical- ever. This morning I tried again and asked for two everything bagels, with turkey sausage and two coffees... They were out of everything bagels(shocker), couldn't figure out how to just get me turkey sausage without cheese and egg anyway/ I went to brueggers where we were greeted by knowledgable and polite customer service and hot exactly what we wanted."}
{"text":"It's a good cafe with free wifi and cozy place to meetup and hangout. 

The food is okay, but don't be expecting Michel's Baguette Bakery quality. 

There is one item in the menu that isn't found in many places, the sourdough bread bowls. Mmmm good!  Brocolli and Cheddar. :)"}
{"text":"Employees are both slow and lazy. Portions are smaller than other locations; if you give correctly sized portions, you have to refill and make more, so why bother? Will not return."}
{"text":"My bowl of soup came with a side of bread.. and this is how it was tossed into my Togo bag. Not sure if it was torn in half or I was given half eaten bread.

{"text":"Nothing feels better for a sore throat than warm chicken noodle soup (which is exactly what I had here last night for dinner)!

I can't even begin to explain how excited I was when I learned a Panera was opening right on Green St. this summer.  It's one of my staples back home, and while it is a chain, they still have a great selection of food and baked goodies.

Typically, I'll get their you-pick-2 (frontega chicken + broccoli cheddar soup = YUM!).  I love dipping their sourdough baguette into the warm soup.

It's definitely a good place to stop by for lunch as they're quick, and you can always grab it to go.  Always a safe bet.  Plus!  Free wi-fi!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed Paradise Bakery became a Panera Bread at Dana Park, but gave it a try. The food was the same and good, as always ... but ... the way you order or self order is majorly screwed up. Busy Sunday, everyone was confused. Very unorganzied set up. I'm not sure it's worth it."}
{"text":"I normally love love love Panera. Today they ruined It for me. First off, they failed to prepare our office's phone in order. When our runner got there....no food. Couldn't even find that we had placed, and paid for! Our order...then they left out two items when they did fill the order. 

All that was really just an inconvenience. It was the getting violently ill after eating my lunch that ruined it for me. Dunno what they did to my broccoli cheddar soup but I thought I was going to die!  Obviously I didn't and now I'm probably never going to be able to enjoy Panera again....bummer!"}
{"text":"Good location close to strip. Usually busy, because of location. 

Good food, friendly staff. Last visit I tried the corn chowder and southwest chicken salad, both excellent, will get again. And for breakfast: Always love the soufflés in the morning and get cravings for them they are so good.

One negative, it always seems to be kind of dirty in this location, maybe it's the high volume of customers but floors always look filled with crumbs and tables are not kept clean."}
{"text":"I always love eating at Panera because of their array of choices and great prices. I sometimes just grab coffee and a bagel but I really like going for lunch. The pick two option is great because you don't have to choose between your favorite sandwich or bowl of soup. The soups are flavorful and always fresh. I would recommend the tomato soup, it's basically the best tomato soup I have ever eaten. The fresh salads are great too and so are the sandwiches and paninis. All the sandwiches are served on their fresh bread. The tuna salad is very good, even for those who are not particularly fond of tuna. Their coffee and pastries are also really good. I would suggest not going between 12 and 1 because it is incredibly busy around this time."}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss. There are times where the cashiers are fantastic, today was not one of those times. Panera, please don't hire people who don't want to be here. Our lives are stressful enough. When we come to Panera to relax or do work, we expect pleasant customer service. I asked for my bagel lightly toasted, which apparently was the most inconvenient, unrealistic request to my cashier. After visibly acting annoyed, I watched him put it in there just like any other bagel and it came out brown and crunchy and exactly the opposite of what I asked for. Disgusting. Additionally, the Internet is slow and spotty and we could use more outlets for devices. Today, I really wish I had chosen a different venue for my Sunday hangout spot :/"}
{"text":"The coffee at all Coveli owned Paneras is terrible.  It is so weak that you can hardly taste it.  Add a bit of creamer to give it body and it will taste like warm milk instead of coffee.  I used to by their country meiche white bread but they stopped selling it.  Another hot selling  bread at the holidays was the Italian Panettone bread.  Best ever. Oh yeah, they stopped selling that too.  Bagels, they add soy to all thier breads including Bagels.  Not sure why.  Nothing on the menu is organic.  Everything is GMO.  ...and they don't care.  While everyone else does customer surveys, they don't want know what you think.  The managers are terrified to tell thier superiors What customers complain about because they know they will be fired.  I wrote customer service and they blew me off.  I then managed to get the phone number and they just said I need to speak to the local manager.  Messed up !   They rarely get my order right and they wonder why I rarely stop in anymore. Go figure!"}
{"text":"Every time I go there they are always out of the four cheese soufflé which is my favorite thing there! And I always come in like 30 minutes after they start serving breakfast so they should not be out!"}
{"text":"They are starting to bring the place up to speed with the customer wishes, which is great. I found that they are trying to keep the place cleaner, which is great. I noticed very little variety in the pastries in this location, but at least I like that now brand wide they have added the flat bread as a sandwich option. The staff is very friendly. Overall great improvement. I hope I can give it 4 stars soon too."}
{"text":"This place sucks so bad!!! Who wants to pay 15.00$ for half a sandwich and half a soup??! Not only was it 15.00 for no food, but the sandwich had no taste, it was so plain--meat, cheese and lettuce. If you want a sandwich Go to Cafe Zupas, Subway or even home!! I have been here once and I will never eat here again.."}
{"text":"Awful. The employees are slow then complain about how busy they are. 10 minute to wait for a sandwich with no one in front of me. So I got to listen to them complain about their job, ask If a jimmy Johns is hiring, and tell their manager that she's being obsessive.  My sandwich looked terrible so I didn't eat it. Don't waste your time here. Try to avoid and go to the other places around the area that have higher quality food and better customer service. This place needs a major overhaul in work ethic and attitude."}
{"text":"It's a good alternative to Starbucks and Tim Hortons. You don't need to hurry to take away. Seating is comfortable and has welcoming , warm atmosphere.
Panini ( tomato & mozzarella ), soup in bread and earl grey tea are my favourites..
Several times their visa machine is out of order. Don't forget to have always cash with you..."}
{"text":"This location, like many others was recently converted from Paradise Bakery to Panera. To be honest, aside from the seating and interior decor, not much has changed. Menu is still pretty much the same. Greek salad is still my go to on the menu."}
{"text":"They're consistently out of the soufflé. Why even have it on the menu? Next thing you know, they'll be out of bread....."}
{"text":"I suggest going in to get your food, because it's definitely faster than going through the drive-thru....I should've learned after the first time I waited 20 minutes to get my food, but I did it again and have been waiting for over 12 minutes."}
{"text":"French onion soup in a bread bowl is amazing. It's the closest thing to an $8 suit from the strip that you can get without spending a fortune."}
{"text":"I love panera! The quality is always good, especially since it is so fast. I like that the nutrition facts are easy to find. There is a pretty good variety of choices as well. Great place to pop into on a time crunch."}
{"text":"Unlike the locations back in Texas, the Iced Green Tea at this location is served to you and you cannot get any refills, unless you want to pay full price for another glass of it. The food is typical Panera, but the lack of free refills on the Green Tea somewhat frustrated me. 

I have a love/hate relationship with Panera because some of their samdwiches are unique, but their overall prices are much higher than other delis and you end up leaving there with a bill similar to eating at a sit down casual restaurant."}
{"text":"Mom & I walked into Panera last night to get salads for dinner.  Two nice young people greeted us and then we were directed to a kiosk to order our meal.  The kiosk was very confusing, and it took 10 minutes or longer just to order! Mom didn't get the right greens, she got romaine instead of spinach.  It's disappointing that this is just another way our society is turning so people don't have to interact with each other.

I hope those workers at Panera are out job hunting because the kiosks are replacing them!  We won't be going back, the food isn't as good as Paradise was anyway!"}
{"text":"It is only fitting on National Grilled Cheese Day that I review the nearly inedible Grilled Cheese Sandwich I was served on Sunday, 4/9/17 at this Panera location.  The cheese was not melted all the way, and one side of the bread had faint grill lines from a panini press, while the other side showed no trace of any exposure to a heat source, other than perhaps a lightbulb.  The sandwich was not hot.  In fact, it was not even warm.  I love a good grilled cheese sandwich, so this was a terrible disappointment.  If I had wanted to just warm up some cheese and slightly warm the bread, I could have used a microwave with better results.  And I would NEVER make a Grilled Cheese Sandwich in a microwave.  The very name is GRILLED Cheese Sandwich. I could have bought an entire loaf of bread & a package of cheese for the money and gone home to enjoy a properly made sandwich.  Say...that's what I'll do from now on."}
{"text":"This location has some great features, and some not-so-great features. But doesn't every restaurant have some good and bad? 
The food is just like any other Panera-Great! 
The parking isn't ideal at all. Especially for those with minivans, SUV, or larger vehicles. This issue can be fixed however by simply parking in the parking lot behind it (Target). 
The space isn't really ideal for working on school/work/etc. It's extremely busy (which is good for business) and ideal for like to-go orders or sit down (at slower times like 3-5). 
Customer service has always been superior. Never had an issue.
Highly recommend for to-go, or delivery. Food is amazing if you can work with smaller spaces."}
{"text":"The major drawback to this location is it's painfully slow wifi, I'd give it a 4 star - but can't with the 0.8mbps I am currently getting. The sign still says 802.11b. Seriously upgrade your internet! The food is decent, service is prompt and my order was correct."}
{"text":"We went for dinner here ..Ordered salad and found hair in it .. returned the salad but no one bothered to apologize.. not a good experience"}
{"text":"When I went to the recently opened Panera on Friday evening, I knew we were in trouble when my young friend ordered the chicken noodle soup in a bread bowl. \"We're out of bread bowls,\" snapped the staff member taking orders. My friend, who had been yearning for soup in a bread bowl ever since she heard about it, finally settled on a classic salad with chicken and I ordered a Thai chicken flat bread sandwich. We made our way down a narrow passage way into the table area. The decor is blah with bad lighting and none of the empty tables had been wiped off. While waiting for our food, I went to the restroom, which clearly had not been recently cleaned and a huge cylinder of toilet paper was set on top of the empty dispenser. Our food arrived and the person in charge of the kitchen must have been friends with the decorator -- blah. Granted the prices are cheaper than Paradise and the excellent Wildflower but for a lot less money we stopped at Frys on the way home and bought a La Brea Olive Oil and Rosemary round loaf and a can of Progresso chicken noodle soup. Now that was a tasty mean!"}
{"text":"This is a great rest stop and a busy panera. They seem to attract hired help with waist long hair. I found a hair wrapped around my pickle. I gave it back to the manager who also had long hair but a different color than the pickle hair . I think I won't go back to panera until they buy the staff hairnets."}
{"text":"Service is always bad...usually unfriendly and slow...food quality is lower than most other Paneras I have visited."}
{"text":"Nice place but management decided to sell me the bread with the soup that usually comes with free.. will not visit this location again!"}
{"text":"Maybe the worst Panera ever. The employees have no idea what is going on . Their nuts for salads are always cross contaminated-  a SERIOUS problem for people with nut allergies . the employees are constantly yelling back and forth and ignoring customers. The worst Panera around. Never returning."}
{"text":"I went to this location twice in the past week and everyone looked miserable who worked there. Panera has always been pretty consistent to me with what  I order but I'm a little blown away at the lack of customer service at this location. I didn't see anyone smile! They didn't have the options of what i wanted available but didn't tell me until after i paid. When i was trying to talk to them the girls looked at me like i was speaking a different language. They need some work here."}
{"text":"Great staff, good food. And there is always a place to sit. Way better than going to the Starbucks that's right across because there's never anywhere to sit over there. The reason I give them 4 stars and not 5 is because their wifi situation is comparable or perhaps worst than dial up.  Starbucks always has reliable wifi. Panera if your wifi was better this place would be the best ever to come for homework, group planning's, work etc."}
{"text":"I visited this location as it is near my work, and I will never go back. I ordered a Greek salad on the app for rapid pick up, and they did not put feta on my salad (this is not an addition, but it comes on the salad automatically). It's not that they didn't put feta on my salad that makes me say I won't come back, although it's a good reason, but rather when I went back up to resolve the issues the lady said they would only allow me to have a few pieces of feta for which she gave me a little cup for...excuse me? I have ordered this salad multiple times before and there was always a fair amount of feta. If feta is automatically in an order, I'm \"allowed\" what I paid for. Just go to one of the many other establishments around here."}
{"text":"I don't think they're ready to do breakfast here. The sausage was cold. The bacon was too (not to mention bathing in its own grease). $.50 for a To Go upgrade cup for a soft drink seems silly. They need to figure out how to keep their food hot - or at least warmer. Not likely to return for this price."}
{"text":"If you see this Panera, KEEP DRIVING!  The service is slower than slow, and the staff is rude.  The employees are too busy socializing in clusters to work.  Complaining to managers does nothing.  I'm surprised this horrible location isn't closed yet."}
{"text":"Always good service and consistent food quality. I also like the calorie postings as well as seasonal change up of menu items. 

Check out the hidden menu online. The power chicken hummus bowl is a great low cal, low carb option."}
{"text":"Like any other Panera out there... except that if you go here to eat after 7 p.m. they are almost guaranteed to be out of everything.
Seriously.
4 out of 5 times I've gone here for dinner I have been given a coupon for a free \"pick 2\" meal because they were out of....well, everything I had tried to order.
Its not like I had gone right at closing or anything....
I try not to go to this location."}
{"text":"This place has been packed almost every time I have gone, but I love it, so it is worth it. Broccoli cheddar soup is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Well I see now why everyone is suggesting rapid pick up. They seemed a bit confused today as to what orders were which. Also, only had one cashier working with a long line while plenty of employees were available to open up. Three of them were in a huddle looking confused and dazed leaving her there alone to handle the front. After a while of standing there then they decide to open another line. Needs a better system that speeds the process along."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this sweet lil place! The food was yummy, the store was beautiful, and I loved how they offered any baked good for 99 cents when you purchase a meal. I will definitely be taking my husband here! very fresh food! ps. the broccoli cheddar soup was amazing! ;)"}
{"text":"Always great service. The environment is warm and welcoming. This company donates so much to it's community and charities. I don't mind paying a little more for a place that donates their bread, pastries, etc to local soup kitchens and shelters. They also have events to support local charities as well. Not to mention...the French toast bagel is always a hit!! Thank you Panera for coming to Bridgeville!"}
{"text":"Consistently gets the order wrong on take out orders.  The customer service is sub par and the prices are outrageous for the quality received."}
{"text":"Great place, well maintained, as all Panera's
A girl named Evelina helped me, she is the best!"}
{"text":"Just placing an order is like pulling teeth, then after waiting over 15 minutes (no other customers in front of me) the order was wrong! Is it me or is the food industry just continuing to get worse and worse with customer service but yet continue to demand more and more pay!"}
{"text":"General manager zack is rude so I wouldn't expect much from the staff . The slowest , unprofessional  panera ever!"}
{"text":"I always use their rapid pickup order ahead app since I work close by and only have a limited time to eat on break! The food I order is always delicious and the employees are always nice to me. I order the frontega panini sandwich (with no red onion) every time and it's got to be one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I literally crave eating this sandwich weekly. My order is always ready 10 minutes after I've placed it making it incredibly convenient! I highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I like Paneras and eat there fairly often at home so when we were traveling and saw this one near our hotel, we decided to have dinner there.  We've never been in such a dirty Paneras.  We had to clean off a table and the restaurant wasn't busy at all.  The employees looked sloppy.  The restrooms were dirty.  The food was good, at least.  We travel here several times a year and will not to back to that Paneras."}
{"text":"I visit almost every week early in the morning for coffee.  Heather and Ellen always have a friendly greeting.  I love Panera's pleasant atmosphere, healthy options, and I've enjoyed their variety of Light Roast, Dark Roast and Hazelnut coffee."}
{"text":"I love Panera! Great food and friendly employees. I always do Rapid pick up, and they know who I am the second I walk through the door."}
{"text":"Ordered a half chicken cobb salad TO GO! Big mistake. Opened bag and had one fork. Salad required FORK and KNIFE so I could look civilized while eating. Lettuce was as old as Moses. At least 1/3 inedible.  Tomatoes also old and obviously stored cut up for at least 2-3 days. Done! There are too many other places to eat in this area to make this an option. Go if you absolutely need FUUD!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Panera in a while and I remembered this morning why that is. I ordered a couple things online for purchase the next morning with the expectation it would be ready when I arrived. I arrived at the location a little early, and the employee told me that they ran out of the spinach and bacon soufflé. I told them I ordered the previous day and they informed me that they do not see the order until 10 minutes before it is supposed to be ready. No apologies, they just gave me the option to either wait 10 minutes for it to be ready or I could choose another soufflé. I opted to wait and 20 minutes later I received the soufflé. 

The food was ok, about what was expected, however based on the customer service and the overall frustration of my visit, I doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"The worst Panera Bread I have ever tried. I have been to this location two times and each time was getting worse. It's a Panera Bread but the service you get is worse than I usually get at places like McDonalds. Sorry McDonalds sometime you do better service. In my first visit the service was slow and I did not get all my food plus no utensils!!! In my second visit i got salad with spoiled cucumber I swear it was spoiled talked to the manager and she addressed my concern. After my lunch i ordered a coffee latte and i did not get it right plus i had to wait forever to have it ready. I swear Panera Bread does not hire qualified and well trained employees for this location"}
{"text":"I think this was my first time at Panera and it was not bad! Coffee is nothing to write home about. Cherry danish was pretty nice because it had a hidden layer of cream cheese. Brownie was nice because it wasn't too sweet but it was a little dry because it was a corner piece. Crowd was a mix of university students and seniors. More comfortable than Starbucks because you don't get the feeling that you have to leave."}
{"text":"If I could give this place -5 stars I would. The service was terrible! Took them almost 3 minutes to even realize I was at the register. The cashier, didn't get her name but our receipt says \"Alex\" was her name. Anyways, I asked her about what type of chicken they put in the tortellini and it seemed to inconvenience her that she had to turn around and ask her manager. My boyfriend ordered a simple turkey, egg and cheese sandwich plain. They gave us a sandwich with turkey, lettuce, tomato, and no egg. When we tried to get them to re make it, they were very rude about it and it took them another 15, almost 20 minutes to get us our new sandwich. Then the second sandwich they gave us was wrong again! They put egg and sausage on a bagel? Nothing near what we ordered in the first place! At that point we had been waiting almost 40 minutes for a breakfast sandwich and gotten 2 wrong sandwiches and terrible service. When we spoke to the manager on duty about it he just shrugged his shoulders and said \"well that's how it's made\". We were furious and ended up leaving without even getting a third sandwich. Ridiculously ran business and we will NEVER be back. I advise you to go ANYWHERE ELSE. The cashiers and management need to be put through a customer service training or else this place will run itself into the ground within the next year."}
{"text":"Accuracy does not matter.  They forget a sandwich and when it took me 30 minutes from original pick up to return to the store and they give me the 30 minutes old sandwich instead of remaking it means I'll never spend money at Panera again."}
{"text":"Not sure what the other crab-apples are complaining about, but I really enjoy Paradise Bakery, and this location in particular. This location is conveniently located, has always had very courteous staff, and has been very clean and tidy every time I have ever come here. Here are a couple of the highlights:

- Very clean and organized line for ordering
- Easy to find what you want from the menu
- Clean and tidy drink area
- Dining room is separated somewhat from the ordering line, which keeps it quiet and relaxed. The 'vibe' here is great, and there is a nice area to eat and hang out on the patio if you want to enjoy the weather
- Extremely clean and nice bathrooms
- Free, functioning, fast WiFi!!"}
{"text":"PROS:  Some of the Panera menu.  Nice atmosphere in the seating area.  Free refills on sodas

CONS:   A lot of the staff and a lot of the pastries.

  The staff...I am not exaggerating when I say I have rarely been in here and not encountered at least one employee who seems uninterested and/or miserable.   I often will stand at the front ordering counter for long periods even after people, who I see working the front counter later,  clearly see me, making eye contact but do not even address me.  The only thing that,  in my opinion,  could lend to such widespread unhappiness and sometimes poor service and attitude is bad management, since it seems almost every employee does not seem happy to be there at all.

The pastries. ... often very old and hard.

Yes, I've been to other Paneras that had much better pastries and happier employees."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are very tasty here or should I call it paninis. Either way the light crunchiness of the bread complements any and all of the meat and cheese combinations. The soups are not bad. The different types of bread can make one go crazy in choosing. Either way this place is great."}
{"text":"The employee preparing food this Friday night was amazing.  Helped me bring out my three plates of food to my table.  I have been to Panera many times and this was the first time an employee went above and beyond.  Great customer service!!!!!!  I hope the employers at this Panera location appreciate having this hardworking and thoughtful employee like that!!!"}
{"text":"Very good spot to grab a quick bite. The food is delicious and the bread they use is amazing. Overall it is a good value for your money. It tends to be a little more expensive than other sandwich places, but the quality is much higher.
Nice friendly staff and very efficient as well.
You choose your food at the counter but they bring it to your table."}
{"text":"Although the food is delicious, I have never received a correct order from their drive through. I have eaten there at least 15 times and they never fail to leave out my croutons, they also often forget my chips, and I've learned not to bother adding a dessert. They won't remember it. At best they forget a side, at worst they will give you a completely different order. I love the Panera business model of serving quality food in a fast food setting, but this location has some serious mismanagement in the drive through."}
{"text":"It is the best Panera I have ever been to. I always order a turkey sandwich and it has always been perfectly made. The service is quick, and there is never a long line to order food. The seating outside is always nice if it it a good temperature outside, and I can't really say anything bad about it."}
{"text":"Brand new store, very clean.  The waiting time is too long as a panera."}
{"text":"The most expensive food I've ever had. $10 for half a sandwich and a cup of soup and it's not very filling. The portion sizes are very small. The chicken has no flavor, and it's just not worth it for that price"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Panera Bread but this has to be one of the most disappointing locations. And that is taken into consideration the fact that it is a rest stop Panera Bread, and one's expectations should already be a little low.

They pretty much have all the things you would expect from a regular Panera Bread. Although their pastry and bread selection is slightly reduced.

The problem is the service is horrible. The staff is slow and obviously indifferent to their job. It's such a contrast to what you normally expect from Panera Bread, that you can't help but take notice and be frustrated by the whole situation.

Free wifi here is a joke. So slow that you literally cannot even check email.

Add to everything the fact that youpay about 30% more for your food than you would at other locations, and there really is no reason that you should eat here"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat a quick salad at a reasonable price. I enjoy the casual atmosphere and outdoor seating at the Dana Park location. What I absolutely can't deal with is getting \"turned\" or \"pink salad stalks\" in my salad. Okay, I can see if 1 were to sneak in there but it was very clear that there were multiple pieces of lettuce that had turned. Argh, where is the quality control? 

My salad was quickly replaced and I was offered an apology which was appreciated. Let's hope this was a one time experience."}
{"text":"I keep coming back because I love the food, no complaints there.  But in the drive thru, they forget things ALL OF THE TIME.  So now I have to sit there after they hand me my bag and take every item out like a crazy person, but I don't want to drive 15 minutes home to find something is missing.  First it was my daughters soup when she ordered grilled cheese & tomato soup.  The next time it was her grilled cheese when we ordered the same thing!  Luckily I checked it there and pulled in to the parking lot (huge pain when you are with little kids) and they gave her a free cookie and I got the sandwich. 3rd time I took everything out and it was all there (YAY!) to only find out my dressings weren't in the salad box when I opened my salad!!  I called and spoke to the manager at that point, just to tell them this is ridiculous and they need to train the drive thru workers to check everything!  The manager apologized and took my address and said they'd send me a coupon in the mail for $10 or something like that.. I forget and it never came.  LOL.  Anyway, management needs to train the staff better.  And just triple check your food before you pull away, including your salads for dressing!  :)"}
{"text":"Solid choice for fast casual.   Love their choice of healthy non-GMO food.   

I really love the new Panera mobile app! It is so easy to order, track your Panera Rewards.  They really got this right.  Just click and 10 minutes later your order is waiting for you.  No lines, no hassle!"}
{"text":"I got hooked on Panera's bagels years ago in Maryland. The Timonium location provided me with a baker's dozen of bagels no matter what hour the hour.  Now I frequent three Albuquerque locations despite the difficulty I have getting them to complete a bagel order successfully. My first visit to their new location resulted in a botched bagel slicing job. The bagel tops were paper thin so they burn in the toaster. I guess they did not test the the slicing machine settings before opening day. Next, I asked for my order to be bagged and got a box instead. Oh did I mention they did not have stock of multigrain? They never do! Hint hint, stock more multigrain? They must have a huge employee turnover. Seems every visit the help does not know how to slice, ring up and bag bagels. Oy vey! They are delicious bagels so I will persevere."}
{"text":"Freshest bread and pastries, I come here all the time for breakfast and lunch. They have anything I'm craving for and great because they have items that's low fat :)"}
{"text":"They gave me the wrong soup. My wife's order was wrong quinoa bowl. They also had 2:30 minute old coffee. Had to wait for a new brew."}
{"text":"Ate here today for the last time. GROSS. Everything was gross. My grilled cheese was inedible, how do you mess up grilled cheese??? They got rid of all of the actually good things on the menu because they were \"paradise items\" I want paradise bakery back ): highly recommended you go to kneaders bakery instead."}
{"text":"We visit Panera regularly.  Its fast casual, good food for relatively cheap.  I normally get the Asiago Bacon Egg & Cheese sandwich, Thai or Asian Sesame Chicken Salad or the Broccoli Cheddar soup in a bread bowl, depending on the time of day.  My son loves their white cheddar mac-n-cheese.  Their iced green tea is really good, but kinda pricey since you don't get refills on em.  I normally visit the Tropicana/Ft.Apache location.  Lately its been sweltering hot in there, they might want to turn down their heater...its a restaurant not a sauna.  Oh and don't forget  to ask about your Panera Rewards, I never check mine online & often times the cashiers don't tell you if you have any which is super annoying.  This location has pretty good service, its a hit-or-miss at their Eastern location."}
{"text":"This Panera location is super chauncey with their coffee.  We stopped in for a quick breakfast yesterday and all coffee carafes w/ the exception of the decaf were empty.  I notified one of the employees and waited about 20 mins or so and they finally brought out two carafes.  I think the employees were out in the Amazon hand picking & roasting the coffee beans themselves cause it took so damn long.  They brought out the light & dark roast BUT the carafes were only partially filled so w/in a matter of minutes they were empty again!!!  Perhaps this location intentionally limits their coffee to drive customers out faster...I dunno why else a restaurant would be so tight w/ their coffee.  Oh and this location doesn't participate in the $.99 pastry add on w/ breakfast sandwiches and their Wi-Fi is ULTRA SLOW, just another reason to skip this location all together!"}
{"text":"What happened at panera?! I used to eat here all the time and after taking a break, I went today and thoroughly disappointed... I got a smoked turkey sandwich and it was the worst deli crap Turkey I've ever had.  Panera advertises how fresh and organic everything, but I think it's a scam.  Done overpaying for sub par food that is clearly cheap.  Gross."}
{"text":"I went to this Panera last night to place a to go order. It was a little more than ten minutes before closing. When I walked in two young women who worked there stood behind the registers kind of to the side and continued talking while looking directly at me. One of the girls turned her back to me and they continued talking. At first I thought they were just finishing up a short conversation and would help me soon but after standing there for a minute or two while they giggle and give side glances to me I just went ahead and left. This entire time, no one said as much as hello to me or acknowledged me in any way. Seems like the food isn't worth dealing with such unprofessional service."}
{"text":"Mediocre food.  And they kick you off the internet after 1/2 an hour at lunch making me waste time.  I even bought their tortilla soup - so I was not a freeloader. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I'm writing this as I sit at the Don mills location cafe 0009. What the website  promised vs actuality was night and day. 
My wife got oatmeal and crossiont
What she got could be described at best was,looked like dry thick undercooked rice porridge ...which she returned immediately...crossiont was cold.and she had to heat that up as well. 
I got the pick two. Mac n cheese and french onion soup. 
Soup was a tad bit salty. I can overlook that however bread was COLD AND TOUGH.   Being a bread place expectation is that the bread is always fresh, warm and soft.   Mac and cheese I will describe as bland noodle soup. 
We didnt finish our food and are going to the nearest  tim hortons for some lunch."}
{"text":"Awesome food. I luv the restaurant because you can have good food with lots of room and wi fi to do work, school or just hang out.  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Panera, especially the one on Fairview near Southpark mall.  I think this one is managed a lot better than the one on Providence, at least from my experiences the past couple months.

The breakfast sandwiches are pretty tasty, I like the sausage, egg and cheese on ciabatta bread.  They also have bacon or you can get it meatless.  I haven't tried many of the bagels besides the free samples, but they seem to be good as well.

All locations have WiFi and don't block anything you should regularly need to get to.

They unfortunately serve Pepsi products.

Only complaint is they could have some more variety for their breakfast sandwiches, maybe offer some on bagels or different types of combinations."}
{"text":"I love it here! The food is always delicious!  Friendly peaceful environment :D perfect place for family,  dates,  study time,  etc."}
{"text":"I frequent a lot of Panera's around town... I asked my daughter to pick me up a Sticky Pecan Roll from the one she is a regular at near her school by UH Hospital on Euclid Avenue.  I was terribly disappointed when she arrived home with it just thrown in a paper bag with napkins stuffed into it!  I had to TEAR the bag off and PICK pieces of it and the napkin out of the roll for about 5 minutes... by that time I lost my taste for it.  I called tho speak with the manager of the Euclid / E. 114th location and she proceeded to tell me she was sorry, they were out of boxes, but this is how they usually serve them to go!!!  I told her it wasn't exceptable and she proceeded to argue with me that if I wanted it packaged different, it was MY JOB to tell them!!!  I told her it was HER JOB to represent Panera in the best way so that a customer would WANT to come back... Not just half as@&\"d!!!  We went back and forth for a while and I finally ended up having to HANG UP on her smartness!!!  Not a good way to help a customer..."}
{"text":"Their customer service/employee training certainly needs some help. As a friend and I entered, one employee had their backs to us and never turned around and another employee, a young lady just looked at us as we entered. We didn't as much receive a hello or I'll be with you in a minute. Just a silent stare from her. We stood there at the counter wanting to place an order a bit confused by the reaction of the employees. As this was happening another employee, I assume a manager by his attire walked from the back passed us and started to assist another customer who just walked through the door. With that my blood starting to boil, we left and went to Starbucks. First impressions are everything and I'll never step foot in that establishment again."}
{"text":"My family and I are long-time fans of Panera, but this location is terrible.  We often use the \"rapid pickup\" service, and almost always have an error in our order.  Today, there was a sandwich missing (luckily I noticed before we left- one of the workers was standing there with the sandwich in her hand.  She and her co-worker thought it was quite funny; I did not).  When I got home, I realized that the baguettes were missing, and one salad was missing croutons.  These are obviously not huge omissions, but it was pretty much the final straw.  I think we will travel a little further and go back to McAllister's Deli."}
{"text":"So far this is one of my favorite places to eat after a long day at school. I'll highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Worst panera of all time.  Be prepared to wait 10X as long as you would at any other panera.  Especially on a Sunday with no lunch rush. Employees are too busy talking to do any work!"}
{"text":"I never feel guilty about eating at Panera. The food is always so good. However, the cantaloupe in my fruit cup today was so hard I couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"I do quite a bit of office lunches and I have used many other Panera Bread locations in the past. Each time prior, they have been very easy to work with and delivered what was expected. This time not so much. 

I placed a delivery order online and selected my desired delivery time and location. We chose Panera since they were the only option that delivered. Once I ordered I got in my car to head to my appointment. I got a call from Kathy saying that they were unable to fulfill the order that I placed since they were already out on delivery for the day. She cancelled my order before I could even call back. I asked her if I could just come pick it up. She said \"there will be no-one here to fulfill your order since we do all of the lunches for the schools.\" It sounded like they were closing the restaurant to go out on delivery? I was not quite sure what that meant but I said ok. She told me to go back online and place the order to the Cactus location. I pulled over and went back on the website to place the order through Cactus. About 15 minutes later I get another call from Kathy saying that I placed the order through her location again. I told her that the website must have sent her the order since she was the closest to the delivery location and in a very snarky manner told me \"that is not how the website works, you just sent it to the wrong location.\" At this point the food was supposed to be delivered in 5 minutes. I was very frustrated with the tone that she was speaking to me with and providing zero customer service. She just kept saying that it was my fault. She said \"it is not my fault you placed the order last minute.\" She was so unwilling to help me come up with a solution and just placed all of the blame on me despite being able to process the order online with no issues. She said that if I wanted to come pick it up it would be ready at 12:30 PM and I lost it. She said that I was not able to pick it up originally but now I can? At that point I was unwilling to give them any business. I called Flowerchild across the street and informed them that I had a terrible time with Panera and I needed food for a lunch that started in 10 minutes. They were super helpful and told me that they would put a rush on the order. I walked across the street and the food was ready for pick-up when I arrived despite their restaurant being packed. I don't want to judge all Panera Breads for the experience that I had with Kathy, so you just may want to go to another location."}
{"text":"This place really upset me because they have removed individual cups of soup from their menu. If you want a cup of soup you have to get a you pick two. Obviously they still have cups and they still have soup, they just refuse to sell it to you in an attempt to make you spend more money and consume more calories than you want to. When I asked why they could not give me a reason and offered me a bread bowl. As if that was somehow better? This location is greedy. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This was a very nice lunch with my wife, son and both of my grand daughters.  We all enjoyed the sandwiches and the turkey chili was awesome.  I wish they had a little bit bigger serving sizes on the sandwiches.  It also seems a little bit expensive for what you get.....

I am still \"in search of the perfect meal\"."}
{"text":"You would think Panera is quick. I had one cashier working a line of 10 people while we could see multiple employees on their phone behind the scenes. Took way too long but the food tasted fine."}
{"text":"Bad experience today, which seems to be the case more and more often since this location transitioned from Paradise to Panera. The coffee was out and many guests were waiting with cups in hand for quite a while. The lady at he counter just kept saying \"we'll get the coffee out as soon as we can\". This is a breakfast place--I would expect that hey could at least get coffee right. The Panera associated who finally refilled the coffee didn't say a word...no \"thank your for your patience\" or \"sorry for the inconvenience\". People's food got cold while waiting and the staff didn't seem to care. They don't appear to have enough staff scheduled for the volume that this place does and you suffer for it. No bussers anymore either. The food is still good just much poorer service."}
{"text":"I love their healthy options and the peaceful atmosphere. You order and pay first than go find a seat with the tracker they give you. The order comes really quick to your table. 
Also if you sign up for their card, get a free pastry. I had a brownie but wasn't a big fan of it. The Mediterranean chicken flat bread and the chipotle sandwich are amazing! Along with that got the broccoli cheddar soup with a baguette, the soup is really thick but tasty. My friend got the orzo soup, which tasted even better! 
I'm going back to try the kale salad. Definitely try this place if you're not feeling the typical eggs with sausage breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Loved sitting out on the patio... unfortunately the manager refused to turn off overhead fans for our party of 20, while the fans in other sections of the patio were off.  Simply unacceptable... insisting that people remain cold."}
{"text":"Really hate that they replaced Paradise Bakery with this place. You would think they would use the same food purveyors since they are all owned by the same company but they obviously do not. Panera would have been better off leaving all the PBs as is. I have dinned at more than one of these and across state lines.. and they have all been just as terrible as the last."}
{"text":"Long story short ... my delivery order was messed up so I called to speak with the manager ... I was very impressed with the manager Nick who was very kind and understanding....  It's hard to find good customer service these days therefore I was grateful :)"}
{"text":"Great. They gave my 15-month old a free cookie and called her the store mascot. Everything else was good as well."}
{"text":"I used their new on-line ordering system (Beta), which I have used several times with few issues.  Today, however, I ordered a bagel w/ cream cheese, along with a drink.  For once, the drink was actually hot, which is a positive (usually they make it when they get the order vs. waiting until close to the actual pick up time, so the drink is not hot).  However, when I got to work, there was no cream cheese, and no utensils.  I called into the store, and spoke to Wes, who clearly had other things on his mind versus talking to a customer.  He asked for my address so he could \"send a few out\".  Send a few what out? People? Cream cheese? He then said I could give him my credit card number and he'd credit it. I do not feel comfortable giving out my number on the phone to a rude employee.   I requested to speak to his manager, but was told  he was the manager, he has a GM but she wasn't in for the next few days.  We shall see if I get any vouchers (which I finally got out of him that is what he wanted to send), or if I am able to talk to the GM.

Other than that, food is decent but extremely overpriced.  Wouldn't go there except it's convenient to work."}
{"text":"There was nothing bad to say about panera bread. Everyone loves panera bread, but now that they stopped carrying country bread and large loaves of rye bread, maybe they should rename their store panera sandwiches. I loved their bread and while they do still carry white wheat and sourdough bread, I can go to any grocery store for that. Their bakery is yummy though. I am dissapointed because I like to make my own sandwhiches and pile on the luncmeat but with good bread. Sorry panera. Call me dissapointed."}
{"text":"I used to love coming to this Panera Bread all the time on my lunch break until recently when they let go the most AMAZING employee with some of the best customer service I've ever experienced in any type of service industry. Eduardo always made me feel welcomed, like a friend, but most importantly always took care of me and made sure I was 100% satisfied with my food. I don't see myself coming back to this location after hearing how management treats fantastic employees."}
{"text":"As another Yelp reviewer stated, the 'Pick 2' option is basically pick a quarter & a half. Their \"half sandwich\" (emphasis on the quotation marks) was more like a two bite sandwich and it was $7.09??? Huge pass!! Outrageous expensive for something that is just mediocre in taste & horrible in size.

Let's keep this place as a bakery than an actual restaurant or cafe. I do like their bread & bagels! Speaking of bagels, I went early morning one time to pick up a bagel, around 7:30am. The cashier wasn't very welcoming & she had to yell to the back of kitchen to see if they had bagels ready. And someone yelling isn't something I want to hear that early in the mornings. But honestly, why would they open at 7 if nothing was ready prior to opening? 

Big pass on this place for food, only good for their baked goods."}
{"text":"I tried the soup and salad last week, it was good and they gave me some bread to dip in my soup. Delicious! Clean, friendly, was ready when I got there to pick it up. I will go back again."}
{"text":"This is my go to place or lunch! Soups are yummy, the salads are delicious!  They have great sandwiches ,  the bakery has something for everyone!"}
{"text":"So excited this was opening so close to our house, but after going there twice have been extremely disappointed. The first time we went they were out of roasted turkey and had to sub with deli turkey, and the chicken in my salad was frozen! The second time we went, the ice machine was broken and ice container always empty. Not good for a place that has been open 3 weeks. My husband ordered a pasta dish and absolutely ridiculous how little food you receive for the money. We say thumbs down to Panera, and hope a few Paradise locations remain open. Will definitely drive a few more miles for better food, value, AND a free cookie!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. I used to like this place, but now its TRASH. Rude employees, Dirty floors and tables. Flies and bugs flying around. Manager didn't seem to care about anything including her appearance... definitely wont be back."}
{"text":"Service is usually pretty good. Occasionally they'll make a mistake, but not often. The facilities are always neat and clean. The staff is always friendly. The food is always exceptional. Would definitely recommend this Panera for a quick lunch or dinner. Oh, and they have a drive-thru window!!"}
{"text":"Bof. Situé en plein centre-ville, ce café vous donne l'impression d'un raffinement intéressant au premier abord, mais détrompez vous. Le chocolat chaud n'est pas chaud, les pâtisseries sont sans grand intérêt et l'ergonomie du service mal pensé."}
{"text":"I live at Panera in Orlando Fl. I got the pick 2 as usual.. Asian chicken and chicken noodle soup. First of all they don't have sour dough bread here just plain rolls (yuk) and the lettuce was old I have to pick though to get a decent bite and the soup was luke warm. Very disappointed. The only  nice thing about this place was the friendly workers.  Not worth the drive here"}
{"text":"I normally get my favorite: Bacon Turkey Bravo with extra sauce on side. For an average size deli sandwich,  how much should it cost? $4?... $5?... $6? Try $8. Yes you get a small bag of chips and small pickle slice with your sandwich, but the price is to steep for me to make it a regular stop.  

I find the food very good and a healthy choice alternative to other fast food restaurants. Service is normally quick,  especially during their busy lunch hour. I rate 4.5 stars for cleanliness, service, and food... but with the price factor for what you get, I had to rate 3 stars."}
{"text":"Classic Panera's, excellent food and clean environment. I tried the new cuban chicken sandwich with my favorite black bean soup today. Mmmm.  A little slower service than normal, but I'll write that off to the post-church Sunday rush.

Also got the Wildberry smoothie. It was delicious, but for $3.99, it better be! :)"}
{"text":"I've been to this Panera often as I live nearby. This said, I will never go back. I worked in restaurants throughout college and even had a roommate who worked at Panera so I am not naive to the fact that their soups come pre-made in plastic bags. However, upon finding the plastic bag in my soup I took home on 10/11/13 I was disgusted. I promptly emailed the general manager who never even bothered to respond. I guess I would have been somewhat more understanding had I gone in there during their busy lunch rush or on a weekend but at 3:30pm on a Friday I was the only person waiting on food. Despicable."}
{"text":"It's 8:40 AM and I've been sitting in the drive-through for more than 20 minutes.  This is ridiculous.  And it's the norm for this place.  If you're ever trying to grab a quick bite to eat before work, don't bother stopping here!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick office lunch pick-up and this location is by far my favorite. The staff here is great! This location is pretty spacious and there are dozens of tables and booths which makes it easy for them to accommodate guests during their peak lunch hours. 

Also, because their WiFi is strong throughout this is generally a nice place to study and browse the interwebz. Service here, I've noticed, is faster than at other Panera Bread locations I've been to.

Love you guys, xoxo"}
{"text":"I would like to congratulate the folks at Panera Bread for taking a great food establish like Paradise Bakery and turning it into a mediocre establishment. The food is now pretty substandard, the service is much slower than what is generally expected, and the pastries that once defined Paradise Bakery are pretty bland and limited. Poor choice of establishments for the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"A good place to come for a lunch. There are lots of different soups and sandwiches to choose from, and a variety of hot and cold drinks.  I would say that this is a good place to go for a basic lunch, a definite step up for Tim Hortons, but not the most original out there.  The atmosphere is a bit like a fast food restaurant, though slightly more family style.  When you're out in the suburbs and there aren't too many choices around, this is a good bet."}
{"text":"Garbage. The whole menu is changed. The food is bland. The prices are higher. The cookie is raw. I used to love the tomato soup. This stuff tastes like its from a can."}
{"text":"TOTALLY OVERPRICED!   I live within walking distance of a Panera and wish I could be satisified with their food, but I find it way overpriced and underwhelming at best.  This time I tried a new quinoa and lentil bowl.  It cost me $9.29, consisted of a funky broth that tasted anything but real and had a few kernels of guinoa and a few lentils.  With ingredients that inexpensive, how on earth do you skimp on them.  I almost laughed out loud when they brought the bowl.  I left starving.  I think I'm spoiled by eating at mom and pop shops like Pho Nam where you get a good bowl of pho with a complex and tasty broth and more food than you can eat in one seating for $8.  This time, I left Panera and walked straight to a little mom and pop Mexican joint on Odana Road and got an awesome quesadilla for $3.50.  Was filling and flavorful - the opposite of Panera.  I've learned my lesson for good."}
{"text":"Solid spot for a quick and easy lunch of soup, salad and sandwiches."}
{"text":"I have had both breakfast and lunch there.   The food is fairly good,  but they tend to skimp on the meat.   My breakfast sandwich only had two striping bacon on it,  so it was mostly bread.   The 1/2 soup sandwich deal was filling and reasonably priced.   However I used the new kiosk and still have not received my email recipt to turn in at work."}
{"text":"This location took an order for 9 boxed lunches for Christmas Eve, when another location refused because they wouldn't have enough staff that day. I had called the Thursday before, which was only a 3 day notice. It was much appreciated, all the orders were perfect, ready on time, and the food was delicious. Much thanks to the staff!"}
{"text":"Totally disappointed, the one place I thought I would get a decent meal BIG MISTAKE!. Panera Bread  has really taken a big hit in food quality. I won't be spending my hard earned money at Panera ever AGAIN!"}
{"text":"The worst and most expensive ! Paid $4.09 for an Ice Chai tea latte 8 Oz almost all ice only 3 sips of actual Ice Chai tea latte. I order an egg sandwich with avacado, tomatoe spinach,egg over easy. Within an hour I was violently ill for the rest of the day throwing up uncontrollably ( my sister also had an egg sandwich and was sick to her stomach but not as sick as I was.
I am still in shock at the cost of an 8oz. Ice Chai tea latte.... The fact the I became so violently ill just didn't help matters. AND yes I did talk to employees and they said that was the price....
I would give 0 (zero ) if they would let me post Definetly DOES NOT deserve a single star !"}
{"text":"I have been here several times for lunch and breakfast.  It never is very busy during those times.  The sstaff is friendly and there is plenty of parking,"}
{"text":"Good selection/quality burdened by rude staffer. 

The self service kiosks are handy and speed up the process. But you still may be unlucky enough to encounter Sandra the cashier who brings the customer relations skills of the IRS and the DMV to the private sector.   

She was apparently attempting to one-up the mute kiosks by conducting her transactions without speaking.   An outstretched hand silently demanded cash and change was returned without comment or thanks.  The next poor soul in line did manage to get an utterance from her:  'Phone number!' She barked at him. 

It seems the Soup Nazi act is much more humorous in fictional sitcom form. 

Sandra's name tag indicated she was a trainer of other associates - a prospect that should fill both management and customers alike with dread, unless dear Sandra is held out an example of what NOT to do."}
{"text":"Small portions for the price you pay...still hungry :("}
{"text":"I was so thrilled when I drove by this location last week and finally got around to trying it out.  I was big fan of Panera in the US and now in hindsight it might have been because it seemed like one of the few healthier options in the Midwest at the time.  However, that being said, my option was hardly a healthier option this time around.  It was a cold night and I wanted soup.  The restaurant featured a grilled fontina sandwich and a creamy tomato soup combo but told me, after paying the extra $$ for a signature sandwich, that they had run out of bread and would be using the bread they use for kids' sandwiches instead.  So essentially, I paid almost $10 for a basic grilled cheese and a not so fantastic soup.  My mother ordered the French onion and it was super salty.  Soooo disappointing.  My memories of Panera are so good so it really does pain me to write this."}
{"text":"Pretty good food to eat if you're looking for a healthier option. Also have great menu items for the kids. Very friendly service usually who are happy to help."}
{"text":"I have to start out by saying that I love Panera Bread.  I was so happy when I saw this one opening in my neck of the woods.  It is so awesome that it has a drive thru.  We usually order online and do the quick pick up option, but this is even better.

I recently went for breakfast for the first time and loved the four cheese quiche.  My daughter had her usual pumpkin muffin that I happily finished.  I know that it is new, but the staff was so happy and helpful.  I really hope that the staff keeps up that service as the newness of the restaurant wears off.

Great food, great service and a drive thru!!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent...I've only ordered the Chicken Walnut sandwich...the first few times it was a good sandwich except they are always running out of croissants so I rarely get it on the bread if my choice. The last two times I've ordered it....it's loaded in pepper! I can barely eat it."}
{"text":"Frickin 4$ drink, half filled salad, burnt baguette, the only thing that is good is the mac and cheese"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've tried a lot of different items from breakfast to lunch, etc. There coffee and teas are good. I love the mango ice tea. Also there turkey chili and autumn soup is to die for. My fav sandwiches are chicken walnut in molasses bread. You can have that in a salad too. I also like in their Southwestern chicken flatbread sandwich. Their turkey with cranberry flatbread sandwich is good as well.  The cookies, muffins and scones are good here. The service was great. Friendly and positive people. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I've come here for German Language meetups and their soups are always delicious. Last Saturday I had Chicken and Wild Rice in a bread bowl, which was very good and filling, which was perfect since I missed breakfast. I also recall sometime ago I had one of their chocolate chip cookies that was excellent. The establishment is clean and well laid-out. They always seem to have a nice selection of soups salads and desserts. I've never seen it get too crowded which allows for good conversation without any need to shout. I am a satisfied repeat customer."}
{"text":"I give the food at paradise bakery 5 stars- the service at this location, however, is horrible. They have gotten my order & coworkers orders wrong on multiple occasions. They are often cold & unfriendly. I have visited many other locations & have not had this problem. It's unfortunate that I often take my business elsewhere due to the staff."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Coffee over one hour old according to the board, and then there was only half a cup.  Oatmeal was cold an very little fruit.  More employees than customers, but service was still poor. Com paired to other locations this one has lots of work to meet expectation."}
{"text":"The food is fresh. Salads are green without wilted lettuce. Not my preferred place to get a sandwich, they are too lite for my taste, but they are tasty. Love the muffins, apple crunch is crack in bread. 

I've notice that not all employee practice good sanitation habits, for example you can't correct your lip makeup with your finger and you can't swipe the tip of your nose. Okay maybe you just had to, but immediately go to a sink and wash your hands. And what happened to beard covers for food preppers?"}
{"text":"I like Panera.  I feel like I can get my money's worth. The food is always tasty and fresh. Service is pleasant and courteous. They also have apple pay.  

They do need to check the lobby more often."}
{"text":"This place is chaos. I ordered online and somehow managed to select the salad twice. My bad. Emily looked at me like I was an idiot and stared at me blankly when I asked for the additional salad to be taken off. Put it this way.. an hour later I'm sitting at my desk without a correct salad. I miss paradise bakery"}
{"text":"Great service from friendly, smiling faces...delicious food. Stopped in with the family during our visit from California and we were not disappointed. I was able to complete assignments for my online classes in a very comfortable and welcoming atmosphere. We will definitely stop in again before heading home. #SpringBreak16"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly. Food was good, relaxing atmosphere. Love having a patio to relax at. :-)"}
{"text":"The place is ran by idiots. I get there and only one in line but the cashier sees me and continues to use a little brush to take crumbs off the device right behind the cashier station.  Finally she FINISHED, so then asks if I'm ready. Asked to get a bagel and they couldn't toast it.  What?  The week before they didn't have the tea made.  The manager during the evenings is not on the ball."}
{"text":"Love the Napa Chicken Salad & Chicken Soup combo. Friendly, efficient clerk. Would definitely recommend it. Service always good"}
{"text":"Terrible service today.  I counted 10 people behind the counter, one person was already being waited on in front of me when I walked in, and it took 10 minutes(I timed it) for them to even take my order. Then, not having ever ordered a black tea w/ lemon, the clerk hands me an empty cup.i asked where is the tea bag & lemon. She says \"over there\". I found the tea bags, none had lemon. No lemon to be found anywhere on counter. Simply said, the service stinks! Especially for what you pay for their products. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Had an amazing salad today! I'm low carb and was pretty impressed with the amount of options they have there. I got the Green Goddess salad and it was delicious. My friends also got half sandwiches and half soups which looked (and smelled) delicious! I will definitely return."}
{"text":"It was so nice to find this at a rest stop. If you've ever visited a Panera before then you know what to expect.  Good tasting menu items that leave me with less guilt than mist road fare options. 

The store was clean and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"$3.79 for a 1/4 yoghurt, 1 sliced strawberry and 1/4 cup granola. $1.79 for decent cup coffee.  Rude cashier.  Yeah, not worth it."}
{"text":"Not a bad Italian; nothing special about this place. Won't come back because of the shitty, moaning music. Add the baked good for 99 cents; fair deal."}
{"text":"Just came from Panera location on hwy 51 by Target. Stood in front of register ( no one in line ) and had several employees walk back and forth totally ignoring me until I asked if someone was working to help me. Was told \"Yea\". Finally waited on without apology for ignoring me. The store management is very poor at training employees \"Customer handling skills)! This is typical for this location. I would suggest a management change since \" A fish rots from the head\"!!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke!  You spend an arm and a leg for lunch but only get the 99 cent pastry offer with the purchase of a drink with your food.  Terribly slow service and I think a school cafeteria is more peaceful, the staff is louder than the customers.  Every time I go I'm reminded why I stay away for so long. Overpriced, unfriendly service, a disorganized staff... the list of dislikes goes on."}
{"text":"Clean, quick and courteous! The staff was helpful and accommodating! They made the perfect sandwich!"}
{"text":"Ok, im writing this review after seeing the news on panera bread dogging gun  owners. Seems for not much of a reason panera has told all people with guns legally that we care not for your business.  Thats how their words on guns are being taken including myself as a gun owner.  
  Considering the food and company it isnt a place i have to have. Bread and soup is their strong suit. The rest to me isnt all that for the price.  I do have to say in the past i did feel the customer service was pretty good though. Have not had a issue with their employees.  
  So, in conclusion i will not be back till they back off my gun rights and stop trying to be johny-do-good in the public eye."}
{"text":"Worst place to go to. Watched a woman receive cold soup while dining in today. And a young man showed her where the microwave was so that she could personally reheat her own soup. I then went up two three different workers getting the same response until one worker told me they would get a manager. So make sure not to come to this Panera unless you want to cook your own food. They treated the situation like it was nothing and went about their business cleaning out the trash. The poor woman who got over pay for a soup she had to cook that's a ridiculous and I hope your manager Covelli should look into who was working 10/5/2013 to take care of that staffing problem."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy food. The smoothies are a huge plus. 
Friendly staff. 
Food to go has some to little wait time. 
Never had a issue with the rewards card, and are actually pretty decent on getting a free drink/desert. 
Prices are slightly above average.
***Last time I went there, through their drive thru, I was the only person there, and had to wait 30 minutes for 2 smoothies??? Not gonna be coming back for a while."}
{"text":"While I like the atmosphere here, I come for the cream of chicken and wild rice soup.  However, today the soup was no longer cream based and is now broth based.  If I wanted a broth based soup, I would've ordered that.  However, why do they change a \"customer favorite\" item?  What's next...are they going to change clam chowder too?  Some things do NOT need to be changed!  First, it was their doing away with the mango iced tea...and now this.  I hope this review will get to the powers that be who make these bad decisions!  This will definitely affect my desire to come here again, especially since they are already more expensive than other lunch time restaurants."}
{"text":"Love it!

They have a very good menu with a few twists on some really good meals.
It would be nice if it was a little bit cheaper, but I guess that could be said for just about anywhere..

I will keep coming back for sure"}
{"text":"Extremely bad customer service. We waited for our food for over 10 mins while the rest of the customers who came in after us got their order. When checked they forgot our order because they were too busy chatting away about their personal life. Extremely unprofessional."}
{"text":"It's never fun having to write reviews like this one but I felt I needed to share a few things.  Hopefully management makes a few changes because I really want this place to do well!

Before I list my feedback I do want to call out that this place just opened, and it's their first location in Phoenix so they may just need to work out some of these kinks.

- Ordering/pick up process is terrible.  just terrible.   The layout of the restaurant is confusing, unorganized and downright uncomfortable.  It's hard to explain but once you order your food you have to wait in this tight, long hallway next to the kitchen where servers run into you to grab food and bring it to some of the tables. At one point the line was so long to wait for food some of the people I was next to had to step outside because it was hot and making them claustrophobic.   Honestly I didn't blame them.  I snapped a quick photo after they had just stepped away which doesn't quite show how tight it was but it will give you an idea of the space I'm talking about.

- Quality of my food was less than epic.  I ordered a pick 2 (soup and half sammy).   The most disappointing part was my \"French onion\" soup.  Normally FO soup comes topped with cheesey goodness and some crunchy bread.   I literally got watery brown broth with onion strips.  Nothing else.       Either they forgot how to make it or ran out of ingredients?  I was in a huge hurry after having to wait so long for my food that I didn't have time to hunt someone down to correct it.   

- Napa chicken salad sandwich was dry :(   Not even sure how a chicken salad sandwich could be dry but this one was.  Bummer.

- Chocolate chip cookie was good!  I have lots of faith in their bakery section.   Will definitely try more next time.

- Server who took my order was very pleasant!

Oh, Panera.  I want to love you so badly.  I'll be back sometime to give you another shot, and I hope to update this review for the better :)"}
{"text":"I'm a fairly regular Panera visitor, probably averaging at least once visit per week at various locations for last 10+ years. Standard Panera food here, don't think that warrants a review, but this is still the worst location I've ever visited because of its poor customer service. 

You should be able to conveniently order online/through their mobile app, which tells you your order is ready for you to just walk in & pick up at a self-service shelf within 5-10 minutes. It's always worked flawlessly for me at other locations, but at this Panera, don't count on it if you're in a hurry--several times, I've come in and my order is not in the usual spot, but instead just sitting behind the counter, totally defeating the purpose of saving time and skipping the line. On my last visit, turns out it was waiting because they were out of one of the items to fulfill it, no big deal, except I sensed immediate attitude from the employee (seemed like a manager and I think she's mentioned in another negative review here...). At the risk of sounding entitled, if a business makes a mistake, I really do expect them to at least be pleasant through the rest of our interaction. 

On a previous visit, I've had to endure a morning cashier that seemed more into chatting up her friend next to me, who was not in line or buying anything, speaking super friendly to her, but acting upset that she even had to take my order--just do your job and act like a normal employee instead of treating me like garbage. And don't make me stand there and wait to get a word into your personal conversation so I can ask for the cup of the drink I ordered that you forgot to give me. 

Multiple times on other to-go orders, they've forgotten my sides, made especially worse as the last time I was there to wait for it to be prepared I had to listen to the employee making my food have a super long, personal conversation with another worker who was just standing around, complaining about coworkers. 

Overall, small annoyances that keep adding up, making me think that management at this location really must not be able to take care of the business well and making me thinking about choosing somewhere else nearby for a quick meal instead."}
{"text":"Only gave a star because I had to. $38 for 3 people, the food is made with the lowest quality ingredients, the salads came with plastic forks(what even is that?), and the employees are the worst part. 

We were charged $5.89 for a half a sandwich that was supposed to be sliced turkey and bread but was rang up as a turkey, avocado bacon something or other. When we brought this to the cashiers attention she proceeded to walk away and wander around the other employees, only to come back with a \"yeah, you should've gotten the right sandwich, now\" and when asked again if there was a price difference, she replied \"no\". The other cashier then got in on the conversation and it was decided that the order was rang in incorrectly and the original cashier went and got the \"manager on shift\", Haley. Rudely, Haley walked over and grabbed the receipt and said, \"So, you want a refund on your sandwich?\" With attitude in her tone and look on her face. Great customer service? When we AGAIN explained the situation she said, \"well I can't put it back on a card and I can't give you cash. You can pick a bakery item.\" With the same rude demeanor, that was her attempt to remedy the error. Needless to say this was far less than acceptable customer service. 

We will not only NEVER return to this location, we will not be going to any location. The quality of the food, the prices, and the customer service has significantly suffered in the change from Paradise Bakery to Panera."}
{"text":"I love the food here. So fresh and delicious. I don't like the prices tho. $15 for half sandwich and a cup of soup seems steep to me."}
{"text":"Very tasty hot and cold foods that are always prepared correctly.  It can get a bit busy around lunch time but the staff is always working quickly to get the orders out as fast as possible.  Some of the food is a bit expensive, but they do have a rewards card program that helps you get the occasional free treat.  There is lots of seating here and I've never found it to be too loud.  I like the chipotle chicken sandwich the best."}
{"text":"Went in tonight at 8:36pm.  Everything shut down and no one working.  One employee actually walked past us taking off his apron.  No one stopped to wait on us.  Everyone was in the back goofing off or something."}
{"text":"What a great experience!! The food was so delicious and fresh. I was so impressed with the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. The management was even personally going around to ensure people had a good experience!! I'm surprised this location hasn't gotten better reviews because it was clean, fast, friendly, and so yummy! If you're ever looking for food on this side of happy valley I suggest this place above anything else in the plazas around here."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE plain and simple. Ordered delivery and they could not find my house. I tried to give her directions and she would not listen and talked over me. Finally 10 minutes later she arrived. I called management to let them know she does not know how to use her GPS and she needs retrained. The employee said that a manager was there but not available to take the call. I just left the message with him. We went to eat out food now and my sandwich had everything on it I requested be removed. I called back and the manager Maria (very kind and apologetic for the issues) said that she would write me down for both my sandwich and salad and that I did not have to get them on the same day but they would be available just ask for a manager. 

NOW when I went back to get the same order I told the employee after ordering that we had a mistake and they were comping this meal to right the issue last time. She called over the Manager Lizbeth and she was beyond rude. She comped one item and walked away, I asked why and the employee said I don't know that is just what she did. I asked her to get ask her why when they had told me both. Apparently this upset Lizbeth as she came back out and rudely stated \"unless it is under another name that is all she did\". I said I don't know why we always have an issue here. Lizbeth said \"I don't know what to tell you\". I asked for her supervisor's name due to her demeanor and she said \"well there are lots of managers and started to rattle off the names of managers.\" 

I will not be back here and I strongly advise you do not waste your money only to be treated with disrespect. I will be contacting corporate but will be taking my business to Kneaders across the street with a much better attitude and food that is not been wrong once."}
{"text":"If i could give this less than one star, I would. Ive been to this Panera twice, the first time they messed up my order. It wasn't too big of a deal so I let it slide. Came back the second time and ordered mac and cheese and a baguette. The mac and cheese was cold and I went back up to tell them and the woman (glasses, heavy set, long thin hair) stuck her finger in my mac and cheese when grabbing the bowl then put it back down and told me \"there's a microwave over there by the coffee\". If I wanted food I had to heat up in the microwave, I would have stayed home. Not only was the mac and cheese cold, the baguette was so stale you could chip a tooth. The service was horrible and I was incredibly offended and unimpressed that I had to heat up my own food. That is unacceptable and ridiculous. 0/5"}
{"text":"We ordered a half Greek salad, a grilled chicken Caesar salad and a kid's mac and cheese. The salads were mostly wilted, browning yellow lettuce. The kid's mac and cheese was barely warm in the center, almost like it was warmed up and left out until someone ordered it. We had to reheat it when we brought it home. The drive-thru is not fast by any means. I don't expect it to be like a fast food drive-thru, but it almost seemed like it would've been better to go inside. The person taking the orders asked if we wanted anything to drink but failed to tell us the drink options when we asked (the menu just has \"soft drink\" listed). This was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Want to talk about slow?   This place is slow.    Everyone working there is completely blasé and everyone looks like it's their first day working there.    I wont be back."}
{"text":"The service was friendly and welcoming. I liked the atmosophere there compared to the one at the Galleria. The light roast coffee is good and perfect for me since it's not too strong or bitter. It's rare for me to find coffee like that. However, I just found the food, including the pastries, just OK. I'm sure I'll be back for the coffee."}
{"text":"Last week we ordered Panera for lunch and my coworkers broth bowl wasn't closed and spilled everywhere, soiling the rest of the food and making for a dry bowl. I called the restaurant and they went out of their way to rectify the situation. 5 star customer service and food!"}
{"text":"Defiantly a little hidden of a location...But who doesn't love salads, soups, & sandwhices. I love the new half & half options with fresh choices."}
{"text":"This location is sooo clean and the customer service is always on point! I love this place and deff recommend it."}
{"text":"Awlful, dirty tables and floor everywhere was only the beginning. The first table was so sticky, we had to move.  I ordered a roasted chicken avacado Blt, it had NO flavor and guess what No bacon, but who needs bacon on a Blt! Not to mention the tiny thin amount of chicken that was on one side of the sandwich. The bread was thin, dry with a 1/6 of mayo if that, but it did have a tiny  amount of mushy avacado, a mushy tomatoe and some wilted lettuce. After the 2nd bite we left. HORRIBLE!!! I knew it was going to be bad when we saw a sign in back that said it was Paradise Bakery. Renaming Panera didnt change anything, its still terrible. I wont even talk about my husbands food."}
{"text":"Was visiting from out of town and had an awful experience.  Over 15 minutes for a toasted bagel - that was given to me cold."}
{"text":"The service isn't the best here.   The atmosphere here isn't the same as other paneras. It seems like the employees aren't ready for it to be panera or trust just switched from paradise.   This is definitely an exception to paneras with quality to the business atmosphere."}
{"text":"We need more establishments like Panera to stop the fast food madness.
But in all honesty they should hire processional chefs to guide them on how to combine and blend foods properly to amaze your taste buds not shock them!"}
{"text":"I ordered take away French onion soup (over $5) and a toasted bagel. The soup cup was not even half full, and came with no cheese and no croutons. The bread that came with the soup looked like it had been bitten off of and was thrown into the bottom of the bag, no wrapper, no side of butter. The bagel wasn't toasted.  On the second go round, the bagel was so burned that it was inedible.  In other words, the Lemmon Avenue location can't get right even the simplest of orders. Crap food, crap service, outstandingly high prices."}
{"text":"Ordered and received incorrect order, something so simple as had onions on a sandwich when the individual had an onion allergy.  Called and spoke with Manager Raven, who immediately rectified the issue with having a new sandwich made and delivered a.s.a.p.  Took it a step further and thanked me for bringing this to their attention so that they are able to couch their cashiers when taking phone orders.  True customer service and will return!  Thank you Raven.

Kami ?"}
{"text":"The food is good, but customer service is a complete abomination.  The drive thru workers are so rude, my appetite diminishes.  Decided to go inside today to order lunch.  The cashier didn't hear what I said, so instead of a civilized, \"excuse me\", she blurts, \"what?!\". When I tried to get a drink refill, a female employee whom was restocking lids didn't even offer to get out of the way so that I, the paying customer could refill my drink.  Instead, she glared at me and didn't budge.  So, as I was refilling my iced tea, got sprayed by the spout.  I used to work in retail and my suggestion is that the whole crew at this location get a refresher in what is deemed as good customer service.  Good customer service inspires people to come back.  As soon as another option becomes available nearby, I will not give them another cent of my hard earned money.  Jersey Mike's is where I may go instead."}
{"text":"Went by after work (which isn't that late, around 5pm) to pick up some bagels for breakfast, and discovered that this location closes at 3pm. I could have sworn that I've had dinner at Panera before, so it must be a quirk of this particular one."}
{"text":"Went here the other day with my mom and sisters after a long day post-Christmas shopping. It was not busy and the service was fast and they were pleasant. My family is quite difficult/picky when ordering and they handled that well (bless their hearts). It is a tad expensive for something that's not a sit down restaurant but the quality of food is worth the extra money I think.

I had just a bowl of broccli cheddar soup since they have limited veggie options. The sandwiches looked small but I guess paninis are not supposed to be super big? I don't know. 

Their bakery section does have AWESOME goodies and with free wifi how could you go wrong? This is a good spot for a quick bite to eat or to spend some time reading/doing homework!"}
{"text":"I received the best customer service I have ever had at a Panera tonight. I really don't remember all of the crew's names... maybe one was named Jackie... but they made me want to come back for sure. My salad was made quickly, They weren't skimpy with ingredients, and EVERYONE WAS IN AN AWESOME MOOD!!! I hate going in to a place and you can tell the people don't want to be there. This crew was not like that at all. Hats off to the night crew on 1.4.17"}
{"text":"Soup was great the best in a while .....
As for the sandwiches they sucked the steak and arugula was soggy from the pickled onions and such a small portion a 3 year old would still be hungry pathetic. My wife's turkey and kale panini  was Groose to say the least. One leaf of kale? And tu r key that tasted old and gamey. We have been loyal customers for years but lately panara has gone down hill."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite to eat. I know they have a parking attendant in the parking lot because of how busy it gets but my office is across the street so I can luckily walk. It does get pretty noisy and crowded around lunch time but if you order online you can get in and out quick. Havent had anything I dont like and will continue to frequent for lunch during the work week."}
{"text":"Pamela can be a little bit pricey but I have gone there over 10 times and they have never gotten my order wrong and it is always so good!! Just thinking about it makes me want to go back right now! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I get the occasional basic craving for their broccoli cheddar soup and Ceasar salad. This location just always leaves something to be desired and the staff as a whole have  BAD tudes. Dirty looks abound and a blatant disregard for customers. It's like we showed up at their home and demanded food, totally crazy for a chain that usually is spot on with the canned friendliness. Silverware is usually dirty, add ons are dismissed. I regret coming here every time I need a quick bite. Ugh."}
{"text":"We love Panera, food always seems fresh and is very tasty. The staff has ALWAYS been so very nice and courteous each time as well, we will be back many times! The broth bowls are very good, only tip  would be to ask for salad dressings on the side bc they do tend to put a little too much dressing on for my tastes."}
{"text":"I love going to Panera for my bread and salad but I must admit that some of the staff are miserable. Food is good for something quick and inexpensive. The bakery items are very tasty and lots of selection. To be fair there is one employee who always goes out of his way when I come in during the early morning. THANKS to Robert at Panera Bread!"}
{"text":"Favourite spot in Heartland area. Food is always freshly made and their pick two is awesome."}
{"text":"Didn't eat here, just wanted to use restroom. Have eaten at other locations for the chain.  However, 1st impressions matter, and the mens bathroom smelled like whoever cleaned it had run out of detergent and also opted for dirty water in the mop bucket instead of clean. In any case, made me wonder what other short cuts/half attempts were made elsewhere in the business."}
{"text":"This is the first Panera Bread location that I visited, and I have been back a few times.  The staff is courteous and helpful.  The food is unique, tasty, and served on real dinnerware.  The broth bowls were particularly good.  The downside is that it is expensive.  A HALF sandwich, bowl of soup, and drink is about $12."}
{"text":"This is a standard Panera. You order your food, you sit, you eat, and then you bus your own table. It wasn't anything special for me. The food was pretty standard for the Panera chain. I typically get the broccoli cheddar soup in the breadbowl during the winter. Today was just a standard Panera day. Nothing special. 

If you're in the mood for something which you can count on, this is the place. If you've been there before, you know what you're getting."}
{"text":"This specific panera is HORRIBLE! The managers are extremely unprofessional and childish. Groping on employees in front of other employees! They refuse to offer their benefits to the employees they \"don't care for\". An employee puked while i stopped in and the managers on duty did NOT send her home! Now i personally don't want to eat someone's puke so i was absolutely disgusted! This place is horrible. They treat their employees like complete crap. I've seen them drop cookies and pick them up for the customers to purchase! The management team at the Brunswick location is just awful! They cut hours when mad, target certain employees, and just seem to do whatever they want. I don't recommend this place to anyone. It truly embarrasses me. I would rather drive to another city than my own just to get panera. This place needs a health inspector to check in. Gross!!!!"}
{"text":"I prefer going to this place over starbucks anyday. I had and earl grey latte with a grilled sandwich that was made with fresh baked bread. Inside the seating is very comfortable and there are many custom sugars and milk percentages for us picky ones:)."}
{"text":"I love Panera! They offer excellent bread , pastries and smoothies but most of all excellent staff, I have been to this particular location many times and always feel welcomed. The Tuesday bagel special for $7.99 (13 Bagels) is a great deal!"}
{"text":"terrible we just witnessed an employee basically just assult a customer, dont go to this location!"}
{"text":"Here's a little love for this place that looks badly needed.  We have no problem with old people and crying babies, the service was just fine and I particularly appreciated the helpful people walking around answering my first-timer questions.  Both my wife and I ordered the \"NEW\" egg white-avocado-spinach.  I really liked it and my wife liked it even more.  It was just a beautiful morning on the patio and the total bill was only $11!  For such a horribly rated place, it sure was comfortable, nice, and packed with people.  And I don't even like these modern snooty bread places!  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with others and say that this Panera is slow. I have waited over 30 minutes at lunch. 

At breakfast (typically a slower time) I have happened to seat myself near the kitchen. I'm surprised anything comes out of that place correctly!

Nevertheless, the food has always been properly prepared on my orders so I'll give them three stars."}
{"text":"I love the food. Based on that alone Panera is usually a solid 5 for me. 

The service at this Panera is....spotty at best. Sometimes the food is super quick, sometimes I'm certain they misplaced my order. I almost always use the kiosk because the cashiers here seem clueless sometimes. They seem to be out of items, drinks, etc fairly often. 

I hope they work out the kinks soon because Panera is a go to spot for me."}
{"text":"Good, consistent food and service.

Parking can be tricky here. 

Not my fav Panera location, because I think half of Ballantyne \"works from home\" at this Panera!  It can be tricky to get a good table due to all the laptop entranced \"customers\" with nary a coffee cup in sight.  Last time I was there with my quiet, well-behaved 4yr old, a woman on a conference call grimaced as we sat down next to her and she proceeded to change tables.  We didn't walk into your office woman - this is a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Good food and service like any other Panera I've been to.  

But, this place is in serious need of a deep cleaning. Heavy dust hanging on light fixtures, greasy finger prints all over the furniture and fixtures, threadbare carpet, etc."}
{"text":"I normally enjoy Panera and food is always fresh, however, the price is a bit ridiculous. I stopped yesterday after work and went to the drive thru. Ordered BLT roast turkey avacado sandwich, a diet pepsi and a cookie. When I got hope I was disappointed to find they forgot to put the bacon on the sandwich. I paid $9.09 just for the sandwich w/bag of chips and pickle. Had to pay an extra $2.39 for the pop. with cookie total bill was $12.67. For this price they could at least include the drink with the meal. (especially when they got the order wrong) I went to this same location a few weeks ago and ordered rapid pickup. I got there a few minutes after the designated time and still had to wait 15 minutes!"}
{"text":"Worst experience of my life. I placed a rapid pick up order online over 2 hours before I was to pick it up. I STILL had to wait an additional 25-30 minutes before it was ready. My flat bread was cold. I will NEVER go back to this location which is sad because I work across the street and I love Panera."}
{"text":"I've been skeptical of Panera in general since some ridiculous experiences at the Willoughy location and this visit solidified that I will not ever go back. 
I ordered and egg and cheese on ciabatta sandwich \"with thick sliced Vermont white cheddar\"...lol. The egg part was okay but the cheese for this sandwich was smaller than a bandaid. I did get one good bite with both egg and cheese.
The boyfriend got egg cheese and bacon on asiago bagel. One two inch slice of bacon. 
I also ordered a yogurt parfait which they forgot to give us so when I went up to ask for it it seriously took more than 10 minutes for someone to bring me one... While I was standing at the counter with my good getting cold. Once it came it looked awfully prepackaged so the wait was more annoying. The problem is there staff doesn't seem to care about anything (probably because their average age is 16). Don't waste your money. We could have had a wonderful diner breakfast for the same price."}
{"text":"A healthier lunch spot with sandwiches and soups. They make their own bread or give the impression that they do. They offer sides of yoghurt, bread or an apple rather than fries. Only 3 complaints. 1. They give you a paper cup as their first offer even when you have it to stay. Ask for a proper coffee mug to help slow down the inevitable destruction of the environment 2. They use processed cheese on their grilled cheese sandwich 3. An American chain.  
The tomato soup is always great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered carry-out and they didn't put the chicken in my chicken ceasar which we had paid for and was on our receipt. I was really disappointed."}
{"text":"I guess the irony would be that I've never actually ordered  from the bakery menu here, because of course Panera specializes in Artisan breads and speciality breads, and all kinds of baked goods from bagels to pastries, cookies, cakes and muffins.  

They also serve sandwiches, soups, and salads, and while I've heard the sandwiches and hot paninis are good, all I've ever ordered, in my health-oriented way, have been the salads -- which means that I actually have enjoyed their bread, because a slice of freshly baked french bread comes with every salad, and it is very good.

But the salads are what I really know and love about Panera.  I've had the Fuji Apple Chicken, the Asian Sesame Chicken, the Grilled Chicken Caesar, and most recently the Strawberry Poppyseed Chicken.  All of these are excellent, but my new favorite is definitely the Strawberry Poppyseed Chicken.  

Aside from the wonderful taste of their salads, the great thing about them is that they use all natural, antibiotic-free chicken.  That is a major plus!

The price of their salads does seem a little high to me, but there's a remedy for that.  I always go with a friend who enjoys their salad as much as I do.  We order one salad and tell the cashier we're going to split it.  They bring it to our table in two bowls -- with a slice of french bread for each of us.  That's a good deal, because half an order is plenty for light, satisfying meal.  

One of these days, maybe I'll try a sandwich or a panini, because I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Live roaches under my table today.   Every Panera in Las Vegas and Henderson is always filthy.  I'm not talking messy from lots of customers leaving trays,  cups,  etc.   I am talking about sticky floors,  dirty tables,  food splattered on every wall/window/door,   greasy hand and finger prints all over.  Sometimes I used to get take-out salads for dinner... the food menu is pretty good.  However,  multiple live roaches is where I draw the line. DONE with Panera."}
{"text":"First off. The food was very good, worth 4-5 stars for price and quality.  The service was 3 stars. The low grade is for the cleanliness. No table had been wiped and many were covered in spilled food. The kitchens were very messy. There were empty boxes, used rubber gloves, food, paper towels all over the floor. The counters were a mess as well. The restaurant wasn't so busy or overwhelmed either.  The place was a little over half full. They really need to clean up."}
{"text":"Pretty solid, nothing too special. Good place if you don't feeling like making dinner, but you want dinner quality food instead of eating out."}
{"text":"for the longest time I thought this was a bread store. Worst, it's a carb loving persons NIGHTMARE ON wider HEM-STREET.  

The menu is a selection of soups, pastries, sandwhiches/paninis on focacia breads and more. 
Penera offers a wide variety of flavours to spice up your soup and sand-which experience. 

If you are here for a light lunch then you can take advantage of their half combo special. Where you get a small soup and half a sand-which for about $3. So you can try out the different types of sanwhichs/soups they have. 

the regular 'combo' comes with soup, sand-which and a side of baguette or chips or apple. At-least there's partial promotion to a healthy meal? 

there are fountain drinks but you can get green tea lemonade which is refreshingly delicious. I'm a huge green tea fan so this beverage  was a nice sidekick for the heavy meal.

The girl at the register wasn't as helpful and didn't really know much about the items on the menu. This is a bad sign for any first time customers. Considering I ended up with 2sides of baguette (and i assumed she meant she hadn't heard the first time) . Of course, she could be new. 

Soup:
the cheddar brocc is the best seller and the minute you taste this creamy broth , you will have the unprecedented \"ahhh\" moment. There isn't the regular chunks of broccoli but you get the odd bits here and there. The soup is very rich with a creamy consistency so a small order should be more than enough.

Sand-which:
 Frontega Chicken on Focaccia - I normally prefer Focaccia but you can get it on Ciabatta too. It comes with smoked pulled chicken that you can taste throughout the panini. Slices of tomatoes, onions,fresh basil all melted with mozzarella cheese and  a chipotle mayo. The mixture of all the flavours gets very oily but teach messy bite is not far from delicious. The Bread is quite thick so I wasn't too fond of the crunch but the chipotle mayo made up for it. I ordered the full panini so the portion was more than enough. On top of that, the baguette peace that comes on the size is just more carbs than I know what to do with. 

Once you are done ordering, you get a gps gadget that blinks while you find seating. The staff use it to locate you and bring your food out when it's ready. They rarely come around to check if every things good, which I would've seriously used. 

Overall, I enjoyed the luxury afternoon lunch and have mentally checked it as a place to treat someone to a fancy lunch. i.e business lunch? Parent in laws in town - lunch?

On my way out, I gave into temptation and tried a cookie from their baked goods section (which just so happens to be cleverly presented right at the front). I decided on 1 chocolate chip cookie - Don't let the '1' fool you , it was a large cookie. And with the largeness, came gooey chocolate chips that made me remember how truly underrated a classic choc. chip cookie is. It passed my poke test which is usually a surefire way to tell the best quality of dough. The test is 3 pokes to the cookie with your pinky finger.
 If there's a slight dent to the dough but the poke to the chocolate part wasn't gooey it's perfect-  The dough was out for a bit but keeps it's partially milky texture and the chocolate wasn't pre packaged when they baked it. So it cools faster than the dough.
 If the dent is super soft and the chocolate melts to the wrapping - then it needs to be sat out for a little while longer and sometimes it's poor quality of chocolate. 

If no poke can be made and you can see cracks on it when the only kind of cracks you should see on a cookie are to ginger cookies -  say 'NO' to cheap cookie dough! (  hey! that rhymes) ^_^

I was here for lunch so it was mostly older couples and a few students using the free wifi. There's tons of seating but it fills up fast. Especially the seats by the windows. I highly recommend smaller portions since the prices are higher than what you'd expect for a soup/sandwhich.

{"text":"Not worth it....
Had the steak and cheddar sandwich. Totally disappointed.  Hardly any steak and way to much bread."}
{"text":"Interesting that this location is listed as 'closed'  because I gave it another try today - big mistake.  I ordered half a salad and received a half box with half of it filled so it is really a one quarter salad.  This location obviously is not learning from its mistakes. I reach out to them often and try to provide helpful feedback like perhaps if you order a half salad, you should get a half salad.  It irks me greatly to pay 7 dollars for a few pieces of lettuce. Really??  Our society has gotten very tolerant with such bad value."}
{"text":"Otima comida por um preco de um fast-food!"}
{"text":"I used to eat here once a week, back when they had mozzarella paninis and butternut squash soup and turkey chili. Since Panera took over, they gradually rid of all my favorite dishes and screwed up the calorie counts on everything at the restaurant (you used to be able to eat a light lunch at Paradise). When they started dropping the items, I reduced the frequencies of my visits but I continued coming for the flavorless low cal avocado blt sandwiches (hold the mayo and the numbers are almost good) and the yummy cookie. A month ago I stopped by another Paradise that had turned into a Panera. That was the straw that broke the camels back. It was terrible.

If they are turning this into a Panera and are getting rid of the cookies, there is no reason for any Paradise fans to continue visiting. I don't need the cookie calories as it is, so I have stopped visiting this place. I wont take the risk that I will drive 10+ miles to find out that the sign has changed over the door."}
{"text":"Napa valley chicken salad sandwich, that's all you need to know! amazing!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place no stars. Horrible customer service. I went to the drive thru and ask for certain sides for my order and the lady said \"yeah yeah I got that\" but it wasn't on the screen so I told her again and she said \"yeah I heard you\". Got home, which is about 20 minutes away to notice they didn't put the sides in there. So I called the restaurant to talk to a manager and he was rude too especially when I said that the lady's attitude when she was taking my order was unacceptable. First he said I could come back for them and I explained I lived out of town so he offered to send me coupons in the mail when he should of put my money back on my card. I spent $23 to have half my order messed up. Not a sorry or anything. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"You probably should put the right ingredients in an asian chicken salad. Not worth $8."}
{"text":"I go to this location all the time and every time they impress me.
Food is always good.
Service is always good.
The prices are a bit much tho."}
{"text":"They are really bad at getting any rapid order pickup correct. I almost barfed when they put sausage on my egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on Sunday- I'm a vegetarian.

In the past they're forgotten sides or only given a half sandwich when whole is order, but this experience was the nail in the coffin for my patronage."}
{"text":"OMG!!! I love Panera but have been made upset and angered by some of the idiots who work here time and time again!! Every visit is time consuming and unpleasant. I've given them lots of tries, but NEVER again."}
{"text":"Being Vegan, my choices are limited. But I've found one sandwich and a salad that is very tasty and filling. 
Quality is great with good service."}
{"text":"Perfect bread and soup I got today. Nice environment as well. Give it 5 stars. Visit it for two consecutive days."}
{"text":"The first few times that I've been to this location I had decent service and the food was good. However, the last four or five times that I've been to this location it's been absolutely terrible. 

The one time we visited it was around dinner time and the store had absolutely no ingredients. They had no pasta, no breads, the pastries were old. We left and didn't order anything. 

The next time I came in they messed up the order and served the sandwiches on the wrong bread. 

Today we came in at 2 for lunch. Me and my friend ordered the pick two and our other friend ordered a full panini. My friends had modified their breads. 

The food arrived at our table in three separate stages. My friend who also ordered the pick 2 got hers first. Then a few minutes later I got mine. We waited another 5-10 minutes for our friends full panini (which was the same as my other friends pick 2 sandwich.... So why did it take so long?) when the waitress came with the full panini we let her know that the breads were incorrect and she informed us that they had run out of the ones we requested. What?! So why assume that we're okay with decisions you made for us?!

This location needs to get their shit together."}
{"text":"I am completely upset with the fact that Panera Bread has ruined Paradise Bakery! The kids meal doesn't satisfy a 6-year-old, the prices have drastically increased, and the cookies are being discontinued! I guess I'll be eating at Wildflower in the future."}
{"text":"Horrible staff that can't get simple orders right. Second time now that my husband and I came home to our sandwiches being completely wrong. Stuff on our sandwiches we specifically asked to not have. I've been to plenty of Paneras in other states and they have their sh*t together, why not this one? For what I'm paying, I expect at least a correct order. Food is good....if you ever get what you ask for."}
{"text":"Panera is one of my favorite lunch options because I've always had consistent food and service from all locations until this one. It's the closest location which is why I eat here, but my roommate and I are willing to drive a little further for a better experience. We ordered dinner recently from here and a whole sandwich was missing. When we called to get the situation remedied someone very young tried to help by offering breakfast, but yeah we kinda wanted dinner or to be reimbursed for it. He said if we brought the receipt in they would look into it. I haven't been back for breakfast or anything else. The 3 stars is because it's convenient and the brand as a whole has been good for me. It's really just this location I believe that needs some work."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed with this service and place. Last time I came in (on Wednesday 8/30/17) it took them about 15 minutes AFTER I ordered and paid to start making my sandwiches. Then while they were making them the girl kept getting distracted and stopping to talk to other employees. Meanwhile, they didn't even make the sandwiches at the same time, so once the second one was made, the first one was cold from sitting there and the general manager Heather just stood by and watched.

 I came again today (Friday 9/1/17) and called 15 min before I arrived to place my order. When I got there, they didn't even start making my sandwiches yet. Once again, I had to wait probably 15 minutes and once the sandwiches were made, they were both completely wrong. I ordered two turkey sausage egg white & spinach sandwiches, one on a plain bagel, one on a cinnamon raisin. When I got my sandwiches, one was on an everything bagel and one was on a sesame. Also, both were regular sausage with tomato and cheese. When I asked for a refund the general manager heather just stood there once again and did nothing. Ironically, a man walked up behind me and asked if his second sandwich was re made yet because they messed his order up and he had been waiting for a while as well. I'm so disappointed, this was such a waste of time and money. I would give this place negative stars if I could."}
{"text":"Seems like every time I come to a Panera bread they are out of what I am wanting. The same is true tonight eating there with my son he did not have what I wanted. Seems to be very poor management and a couple of these locations that I have been to. Perhaps they will understand that they need to have enough food in the evening hours when many of us are able to come and eat at their restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst location ever Can never make my order right always have to complain about my food only at that location especially the Mac and cheese taste like bad milk and old cheese Made me throw up once horrible staff witnessed with my own eyes an Employ drop the unpeeled banana and put it back in the blinder for the smoothie never going there again recommend new staff"}
{"text":"Run out of everything an hour after they open. I try to order soufflé and they always are out or run out of the bowls they put it in. I'm disappointed in this panera. I never had this issue at any paneras in Minnesota. They lost me as a customer and I am definitely not recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I like the different selections for breakfast and lunch.  It's hard to make a choice!  My husband and I both got a soup and sandwich.  The soups were very good.  The sandwiches were good, not excellent.  I would have given 4 stars, but the price is way too high for this food.  With a coffee, 2 sandwiches and 2 soups our bill was almost $30!   The food is good, but not that good to pay so much for it."}
{"text":"Only returning under peer pressure.  I always feel like I paid too much. Not paying $9 for a not so great sandwich I can make at home."}
{"text":"I read about this chain in Fast Company. It's a curious US business model. I was up here to put some snow tires on my car and came across this place. And so I tried it. I agree with the other reviewers about the generic and plastic nature of both decor and food. 

You feel as though you are eating in an airport restaurant. The bread is a simulacra of real bakery-fresh bread and the copious amounts of salt, starch and sugar in their soups, breads and sauces are in evidence. All
 that \"stuff\" seems to fool the senior citizens, who tend to eat here.

In the end, the food feels and tastes like an upscale Tim Horton's.

Save your money and eat across the street, or anywhere else."}
{"text":"As far as I know there aren't any Paneras in Northwest Las Vegas so I always run over to Lake Mead (a bit of a drive). Most often I am dragged there by my girlfriend who LOVES Panera and is obsessed with their lemon orzo soup. I have to say that the food is worth the drive and the price for the quality you get, I have never had a bad dish at any Panera. 

I went in recently to pick up food for my girlfriend, who was distraught after having a tough day at work. I ordered the customary lemon orzo soup, all was well, but then the manager came out nicely to explain to me (after the order was placed) that they have discontinued that soup completely. \"Forever?\" I gasped with the air of a fainting maiden. \"It's my girlfriend's favorite!!\" He was (kindly) caring about the whole thing as I struggled to think of something different to order for her. Imagine my surprise when he comped me the soup completely and insisted on refunding the $$ for it and still gave me a different type of soup for free. Please note, I didn't ask for this and actually tried to press the refunded cash back into his hands, but he insisted. To me that was ABOVE AND BEYOND customer service. Despite their lack of lemon orzo soup, I will probably return again."}
{"text":"I have to say I have been into this location only a handful of times. However I have ordered catering for my company many times.

Not only did they agree to deliver to my location outside of Richmond Hill but I am continually happy at the level of service, quality of the food, presentation, and quick delivery. 

They always call to confirm my order and confirm delivery time. This helps a lot when I am running around getting things ready for my client meetings. I know I do not have to worry about the food.

My clients are always giving me compliments on the food :)"}
{"text":"All I wanted was a chicken salad sandwich. I tried to order at the kiosk station but it wouldn't acknowledge my credit card. So I went to the cashier. It took 2 minutes for me to explain to the lady that a chicken salad sandwich is not a salad. Then after all that time she got my order wrong. She gave me a grilled chicken sandwich. Not even remotely close to a chicken salad sandwich, there was Caesar dressing on it for goodness sake. The only similarities between what I got and what I wanted to order was that it was chicken and had bread. Seriously how do you live in the south and not know what chicken salad is? I've heard from others that this location just doesn't have their stuff together. Friends have said they asked for fresh fruits / vegetables to be added to their order and they are always out because \"they went bad.\" You're a food service establishment; if you don't know how to keep your food from spoiling you shouldn't be in business. Rant over!!!h"}
{"text":"it's winter.  a long winter.  and it's exceptionally cold.  and it's saturday.

clevelanders in the burbs flock to this place for carbtastic adventures through yeast and grains.

i, decidedly, ventured out for one of those darn bread bowls to warm my carb cravin' butt in the bitterest of long winters.

now, i ask you, why on earth, in a freaking long ass winter, would you not make sure you are stocked ready for your patrons?  when i walk into said carbtastic establishment on a late saturday afternoon, i am not expecting to hear from some sophomore at westpark high that they are *out* of bread bowls.

what in the sam hell are you talking about, peggy sue?  out of bread bowls??
OUT OF BREAD BOWLS???
BUT IT'S THE LAST WEEKEND OF FEBRUARY.  IT'S THE WEEKEND.  IT'S TEN DEGREES OUTSIDE.  WHY ON EARTH DON'T YOU HAVE BREAD BOWLS???


....i'm calm.  i'm fine.  i mean, sure, i just went out of my way to drive to your damn establishment after co-workers discussed panera all week long to partake in said extravagance.  sure, i don't really mind.  sure, that small 8 ounce cup you give me of broccoli cheese will curb my craving, satisfying my grain longing desire coated in a rich, oozy cheese heaven of cheddar bursting with soft, steamed, lush green broccoli bunches.

SURE IT WILL.

chaches."}
{"text":"Not a good day at Panera... Bagel wasn't sliced/toasted, but no problem - I figured I'd finally get to enjoy a hot, toasted bagel with cream cheese (self applied, which I'm not a fan of but get the economics).   Anyway, light roast and dark roast coffees were both out (this happens much more often than one would think possible).  Wait...   Then I coffee came out, but no lids.   Wait...  still no lids.  So I left, and now have cold bagel and rapidly cooling coffee.  

Started review with 3 stars because Panera is generally better but I'm mad about cold bagels, cooling coffee and unnecessary waiting so downgraded to 2 stars.  

Oh, and I read in the WSJ this morning that Panera has figured out how to reduce in-line wait times from 8 minutes to 1 minutes.  Well zip-a-dee-doo-dah."}
{"text":"Soup in the breadbowl comes with an apple. Don't know it's usual or it is holiday special. I like soup and bread so this dish is definitely for me and panera does a good job. BTW, I tried mix vegs and chicken noodle. I prefer the latter one since it is less salty."}
{"text":"Wow I miss Paradise Bakery! This Panera Bread at the very least needs a district manager to come in and bring it up to a respectable standard. This location is out of product all the time. Mid afternoon and out of most cookies with no plan to bake anymore for the day. No one I know likes the iPad like order stations. Most people line up to order from ever changing staff that are slow and uninformed. Someone from Panera Bread head office needs to walk across the street and see the  Wildflower Bread location full of people and take a hint."}
{"text":"Way too salty food and a bit overpriced also feels like takes forever to get orders. Use to love this place but honestly for what you get the food isn't that great."}
{"text":"The cashier asked repeatedly, how many do you want...she meant, How many 'butters'?
The mostly empty dining room had mostly dirty tables.The kitchen had a hard time providing a toasted bagel. I'm guessing (hoping) the star employees are not working this evening."}

I used to go to Paradise Bakery and get a nice sandwich and a cookie for a relaxing simple lunch.

The Panera version of the chicken walnut comes on stale bread with a cookie that isn't worth eating.  The chocolate chip cookie is grainy, hard and a waste of calories.

The lowering of quality from where it was with Paradise bakery to Panera is really astounding.   This is clearly a case of a larger company buying out the better smaller company instead of competing with them.  Now that they have removed the better company from the market they offer a lower quality option in its place.

Paradise is now lost leaving a mess in its place..."}

{"text":"***Highlights***: GREAT CHAIN COMPANY, FREE WIFI, Consistent Menu, great place to meet up casually with some friends. Starbucks style.

Negatives: Didn't LOVE this location (Experienced way better locations), particular location was too busy, dirty, no effort in food preparation. 

I find the Panera Bead Chain to be AWESOME. Great place to casually meet up with friends for a light lunch. Great place to meet up with someone you just met. Unfortunately I didn't have a great experience with this location. The lady who brought me my lunch also was sweeping the floors. Dishes were stacked high at the trash cans. Lines to order were 7 people deep, food took a while to get to me considering I only ordered a half a sandwich and some soup. Crazy how busy this location was for a Tuesday afternoon.

Price/Food: $10-15 Lunch. Food is always really light and refreshing at Panera Bread. Its basic safe ground for your picky eaters. In my opinion the food is a little bit pricey for the quantity, type of food, and preparation effort you are getting. I paid $12 for a half a sandwich, a bowl of french onion soup, and a soda. Was not so impressed with this particular location. Spoon was not very clean and had water spots, sandwich was very tiny and falling apart (3 big bites for a guy), and soup was just warm. I asked for the soup croutons on the side and they gave me about 4 croutons in a soup container. They didn't even bother to cut my bread in half. They just ripped a chunk off the loaf. I do however like how Panera Bread uses real cuts of turkey, and not the thin sliced pressed stuff.

Service/Ambiance: I like how the cashiers are separate from food preparation area. As busy as this location was, the cashier took the time to answer my questions and offer and explain to me about their rewards card. The customer service was spot on and everyone was friendly, but the food took forever to come out. This location cannot keep up with the amount of people that are coming through. Tables were dirty, floors had trash, trash cans were over flowing. Parking lot was packed. But on a positive note; there is a burger place next door, and a Panda express next door to that, with tables all outside, for those times when each person is in the mood for something different."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Panera. In fact, I have to stop myself from eating here all the time, especially when it is cold out and I crave soup.

I'm a big fan of their French Onion Soup. It is very flavorful and always seems to have just the right amount of onions. I recommend you get it in a bread bowl, but if you get it to go double check that they have included all of the accouterments (bread bowl, croutons, cheese). On a couple, very sad occasions they have forgotten either one or the other in my to-go bag. The broccoli and cheese soup is also very good.

The salads are really good with very unique combinations that are a nice change from the normal things you can get for similar prices at Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday. Their sandwiches are also very nice, but the Panini is a bit on the smallish side.

Oh! The bagels, especially the Asiago cheese, are great! You can even got a dozen to go with schmear  for your work staff meetings.

The chai tea is yummy - way better than Starbucks.

As a bonus, Panera offers free wi-fi. I've done some writing in here on my laptop, and even though the jazz music was a bit loud for my taste, the free wireless more than made up for it.

My only major complaint (besides them forgetting my blasted croutons) is that this location never seems to have enough registers open and the line very quickly becomes annoying, especially when people can't figure out what they want."}
{"text":"I got the Tky Brovo Sdw.  They didn't have the correct bread so, they placed it on sourdough. A single word. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I've ordered catering from here several times for my company, and I was not too happy with my experience. For catering orders, you choose a 15 minute delivery window and they delivered 30 minutes after the end of the time frame. If it was just lunch for myself it would not have been an issue, but it was catering for a large event at my company, and it was a big issue that the food was late."}
{"text":"Stopped in on this location yesterday, 11/27, well after the lunch crowd (2:30p) to grab a sandwich. There was no one in line and only 2 individuals seated in the \"to go\" area. Ordered my favorite, Sierra Turkey on Focaccia bread.  Waited pretty close to 10 minutes for 1 sandwich along with one of those 2 individuals previously seated. I was only slightly irritated by that but what really pushed my button was to get home and discover the sandwich was on plain old wheat bread and missing the Swiss cheese I had requested. No worries, had some provolone slices in the fridge.  Went to cut the sandwich in half and low and behold the crust was hard.  I tore of a piece of bread, stale.  Come on!! Not only did I NOT get the type of bread I wanted but you make my sandwich from bread with obvious questionable freshness?!  Waste. Couldn't even saw off the crust and eat the bread, too chewy. For a $7 sandwich and bag of chips I may hit Jimmy Johns further down the street.  If nothing else they're freaky fast!"}
{"text":"It was OK the food was good the broccoli cheese soup was amazing but the sandwiches were very small, my mom and I split $17 each for lunch, so if you want an expensive lunch go here lol there was also a table that was totally broken and was lopsided so that was disappointing because Panera is pretty new.. The chairs had crumbs on them which wasn't great to brush them off myself, kinda gross"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Always double checking my order when I order out and if they don't have it, they always substitute with extra. Unlike all other fast food, all you get is sorry for the 30 minute wait but you get nothing. Lol"}
{"text":"Panera Bread ah yes, a wonderful modern day fast food café. Well I do happen to enjoy Panera Bread although it is an ironic modern depiction of what a Café is. They have some pretty tasty almost-homemade soups and sandwiches and some fantastic coffee. A nice bakery to keep your sweet tooth satisfied and your belly full. More specifically though. I despise this location.

I have been to this location a bunch of times (over 20 at least) and every time I go it seems the same kind of disappointing experience. A couple examples:

 First of all the first time I went here in my life I was still in high school and was here just doing some homework. Not one single table was clean so I cleaned it myself. I went to the front and ordered some soup, a coffee, and a water and got to work on some un-important  English paper that I would never remember. The second I opened my laptop to start working, an employee comes over and very rudely says \"how old are you? you can't sit here all night  doing homework.\" Keep in mind I had only a few sips from my soup and coffee when she arrived in front of me. 

I look up and say excuse me? So she repeats herself. I said well I am a paying customer and you have free wifi, so if people are welcome to use free wifi and you have coffee and a bakery, what kind of place is this? She proceeded to say that they were a Fast-food Restaurant and that she didn't want to get stuck there after her shift to clean my table. I told her not one of these tables were cleaned when I sat down. She grunted and said \"yeah right\" and trotted away. So, having felt extremely disrespected; packed up my laptop and homework, left my full cup of coffee along with the water and full bowl of soup and walked to the front cash register where her, and her manager were standing. As I walk up I even hear her bitching to her manager about me sitting and doing homework. 

She notices me out of the corner of her eye and immediately stops talking and walks into the back. So I say, \"too late\". I tell the manager I want my money back for what she had just said to me while I was sitting down. I said I did not feel welcome and would like to take my money elsewhere. The manager agreed but only because I had walked up on them talking about me. I got my money back and said I left my entire meal at my table and left. I couldn't believe it.

Quickly 2 others, one for some reason one of the booths was just missing an entire bench. so their replacement was a random chair which I will try to put in the pictures section of this location. Also I just went here today and ordered and just got a very \"hurry up so I can do nothing\" response. No thank you just here is your change and move on.

Again I love Panera but this location is just awful, over crowded, rude employees, and just a lack of convenience to customers (i.e. fixing a booth, cleaning tables, etc.)"}
{"text":"Well I have been going to this particular location for a while, it was fantastic when it came about. It is in a fantastic location for a couple of reason 1. It is a great place to grab a quick lunch that isn't flash heated and during work, 2. For the same reasons, it is a great place to stop afterwork for some nice soup or sandwiches. Their coffee is pretty good as well add their lemonade. You really can't go wrong with Panera and finally the Fitchburg Location is a great addition to the arsenal."}
{"text":"Update from three years ago. Lame, I know. These cashiers/servers (and I mean several, over multiple visits) have got to be trained better in terms of just simple friendliness. And competency. And not making me feel like an idiot for asking for a muffin instead of a \"muffie.\"

Kinda sucks, but I still like the food."}
{"text":"I love Paradise cookies!  We need you in Nor Cal!!!!  Every time I'm in AZ, I have to get my fix.  Before going to the airport I got my dozen cookies.  $8 for 1 dozen!  That is totally worth it.  How do they manage to be so soft?  It's probably all the butter.  I don't care because they are so good!  I got the large crumbed blue cheese walnut salad with chicken that 2 of us shared and we were full.  The bowl is huge.  I watched him make my salad and he put 5 scoops of cheese and a huge handful of cranberries!  I opted to change the dressing to balsamic instead of having the caesar since I had 1 dozen cookies to eat I thought I could be somewhat more healthy with the dressing.  The dressing was a little disappointing.  I was expecting it to be slightly sweet but it wasn't and there was rosemary in it?  I only like rosemary on my chicken!  I guess I should have stuck with caesar dressing.  Oh well!  On my next visit to az..."}
{"text":"I ordered a delivery for 6 people for a lunch meeting. They delivery driver brought the order on time. I started to check it and he said its all there we have double checked it. I took him at his word. Mistake #1. We were missing one sandwich, so I called and explained we were short one sandwich. The girl apologized and said I need to put you on a brief hold Mistake #2...10 minutes later there was no more music...I had to hang up and call back now I am angry. Another almost 6 minutes and the manager gets on the phone and says sorry were really busy,  we will remake the sandwich and send it. REALLY ...I PROMISE you when I am picking a place to order food from I will not do business with you again."}
{"text":"Hmm. Very interesting Panera.

A brand-spankin' new, clean, and spacious Panera with a large parking lot. This location has the nicest people working here! I seriously feel like they might be robots. They open the door for you, smile when you walk in, feed you free samples, clear your tray, ask you how everything is, and ask if they can bring you anything. Strange. Very kind, but almost annoying. Sometimes I just wanna enjoy my soup in a bread bowl in peace, you know?

Another \"are they robots?\" moment was when the woman taking my order didn't know what wi-fi was when I asked about it. And she was, like, 35, not 85. Wi-fi has become a term so ingrained in our lives that I actually had to think for a minute and decide how to rephrase it (which I should admittedly be embarrassed about). After saying wi-fi twice, i was like, \"Uhh...you know...computers? Free internet?\" and then she got it.

Anyway, great soups, breads, and the like, but you knew that. It's a good new space on Rockside that I'll probably frequent a few times until DiBella's opens up in the same plaza. (Sorry, but you know how I feel about my DiBella's!)"}
{"text":"This has been the poorest excuse for food- too bad the production company paid for it!"}
{"text":"Love this Panera Bread location! The staff member that took my order was very professional and patient. The food was magnificent and was exactly what we ordered without any complications! Make sure you try the broccoli cheese soup or Greek salad! ;) I liked that they had a wide selection of drinks and teas. Overall, I will come back to this location for sure!"}
{"text":"Panera Bread is a big bakery chain in the US; people love this place.  I really do not get the hype.  Yes, the baked goods look good but they taste average.  Their sandwiches are not bad yet not great either.  Their locations do have free wi-fi.  Oddly enough, during peak time for lunch between 11:30am - 1pm, wi-fi access is limited to 30 minutes!  I found out about this policy after speaking to one of the servers; it is not posted anywhere!

Plus side, service is quick.  If you are in the Square One area, Panera Bread is worth checking out if you have never been."}
{"text":"Great fresh food and speedy service.  All employees are well trained and everyone is very pleasant.  Pleasant atmosphere, a nice place to have breakfast lunch or dinner.   :)"}
{"text":"Good was fair. Service was sloooow. Took nearly 1/2 hour for a bowl of won ton soup.  The kitchen looked clueless when the food runner kept asking, she finally had to make it herself.  No apology, no offer to make up for the long wait."}
{"text":"If they keep up making more bread bowls so you can have one for dinner....I'd give 5 Stars!     They are getting better but also when they get busy....those yummy bowls go fast.  I hate broccoli but their broccoli and cheddar soup is out of this world yummy!   It's my fav!   Great staff!   Their desserts are delicious.  Pumpkin spice muffins are to die for!"}
{"text":"Oh Panera Bread, how I heart you!  The american chain has made its way to the downtown core and I love it!  It is a place you can get a great coffee and sandwich while being able to work away with their free wifi.  Their salad are big, filling and yummy!  The pastries are absolutely yummy as well.  Service is top-notch.  Head up to the second floor for more seating and a nice view of Yonge street.

This location is my stop for on-the-go work and emails.  Make it yours too!"}
{"text":"this location continues to not get the orders correct if you use the fast kiosk! three times in a row they missed something."}
{"text":"Drive through is great! But the service is horrible. Traditional food chain. The manager is awesome but has to control a bunch of workers woul could care less about Panera or the customer. Everytime I go into this location, I get a person waiting on me that has an attitude, someone with no desire to be there or just a plain mean person. Not to mention I have gotten the wrong food, low quality food and dramatically slow service.

When it comes to Panera around the Mayfield area, I go with the Wilson Mills location. Everything is noticably better."}
{"text":"Favorite healthy chain. Great and friendly service here. Just double check if you order a special salad. My favorite is the chicken-apple salad with avocado (extra).  So tasty, filling, healthy and great value for the cost."}
{"text":"I've ordered rapid takeout from this Panera three times in the last month. Each time there was something missing from my order. The first time it was the avocado that I paid extra for, the second time was salad dressing for my salad, and the third time was a spoon for my soup. While I know in the grand movie of life these are not huge things, but it IS very frustrating when you leave work to pick up your order and don't know there is an issue until you get back. VERY FRUSTRATING! The response when I called was to ask if I could drive back for my missing items. Really?"}
{"text":"The switch over from Paradise Bakery hasn't been as successful as it should have. The customer service had fallen a bit and the food quality has slightly dropped. Overall it's not bad, just a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"The green goddess cobb salad, a rare highlight to an otherwise dull workday. The sublime culmination of flavors dance together causing instant euphoria. Tender chicken, creamy avocado, crunchy bacon, a perfect hard-boiled egg on a bed of the luscious, crunchy lettuce. I love this salad. This is my favorite salad. Respect the salad. 

A few weeks back I placed an order of the green goddess cobb for rapid pick-up. Without issue I swooped in, got my salad and began feverishly munching away until I realized something was truly off. The gloriousness was somehow muted, my favorite salad ingredients were somehow missing. Disappointed, I called and spoke to the manager Susan. 

Susan was extremely understanding and took action to fix the problem. I was graciously offered a new lunch on the house. Of course, I ordered the green goddess cobb salad and this time it was made absolutely perfect and all is right in the world again. Thank you Susan for your epic customer service and thank you to Panera for feeding my soul delicious salad."}
{"text":"My review is mostly based on PRICE ,rather than food quality. 
I received a gift card for my birthday and hence.....this was dinner tonite. 
I hardly ever eat here just because of the prices. 
 
I've said it before and I will say it again.....I know.food.costs and this is a Corporate ran restaurant chain, so the food costs are probably at least 5-10% lower than my guesstimate......solely  because I'm certain they have their own brand of items that are solely marketed for them. 

Based on this,  ppl need to understand they are getting ROBBED. 

I ordered a Bacon turkey bravo, a bowl of chicken noodle soup, a large Green tea and 2 brownies. My total was almost $22. 
TWENTY TWO DOLLARS !!!!!!!!! 
For a sandwich, soup, beverage and dessert. 

Restaurants are really making it big these days because for the simple fact that parents don't cook at home anymore, and they have raised the average ticket price. 
So with that in mind. I just don't think Panera warrants these prices and why I either take my.business elsewhere or cook at home. 
It's a shame too....but mothers are lazier these days and we all are suffering. Back in the day, our family went out to eat for Sunday dinner or only on a special occasion. Now it's simply the norm...and checks have increased probably on an average of 30% over the past 5 years. 

Panera, your making out. But not on my.buck. lol. 
Food is average. Prices are high. You do the math."}
{"text":"This was my spot in Seattle.  I loved being able to get a soup or pastry and enjoying the fireplace on cold damp days.  

The ambience here is equally as welcoming.  Clean and cozy eating area.

I would agree with the rest of the reviews, the staff seems to be poorly trained and confused on the menu.  Even I have a hard time understanding the \"pick 2\" options.  When I went it was empty, I got my food quickly.  It seems that they are trying to figure things out still with the food delivery as the runners get confused easily.

I got the chipotle cheddar sandwich which was good.  My main complaint was that for $13 it seems overpriced for a tiny sandwich and salad.  

I'll come back for coffee and pastries but not the food.  Slightly better, but overpriced paradise cafe."}
{"text":"Great soups and sandwiches.  My usual favorite is the grilled cheese pannini with turkey in it and a cup of broccoli cheese soups.  (love to dip my sand. into the soup) They have fresh ingredients and several teas for a healthy washing down of your food.  You might be tempted by their full-fledged bakery there where they have something for everyone.  Join their club and get good offers regularly..."}
{"text":"Terrible service every time at this location! I use the drive through and every time it's a 10-15 minute wait at least. Then today I ordered a coffee and they didn't fill the cup all the way, not even chose! Great food, terrible service! Oh every person on drive through is alway pissy, like they are inconvenienced that customers use it. Seriously!?"}
{"text":"Panera Bread on Euclid it's okay it's hard to get in your building when you're in a wheelchair the doors are very hard to open leave a sin away fast it did make it a handicap accessible building which they don't because they don't have the doors that open for handicapped people that prevents a lot of people wanted to go in their facilities otherwise the service is ok not really the staff is excellent very nice especially evening time where's the restaurant is located its college also a lot of senior citizens building with handicapped people in wheelchairs that's why we need doors that open"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 sandwiches for to go and when we got home its not there. They put wrong bread on the other sandwich. The pastry they gave is old. The soup is too salty and not good at all. I would rather have the noodles sold in stores.

Horrible experience and definitely wont come back"}
{"text":"Have gotten a hair in my food twice at this location. Otherwise I would like it. Also my sandwich tasted really gross last time. The lettuce tasted old and mushy. Id rather go to kneaders a few miles away, which is unfortunate as I live right next to this panera. Was great when it first opened, but has gone downhill since.. Will be back once it's cleaner and fresher food"}
{"text":"I'm the type of person that LOVES restaurants who support different \"healthy\" food options. That being said, I am a low carbie and I feel that though it sticks me in the stereotype of \"dieter\" or \"hipster\" - I actually actively try NOT to hassle restaurants with my personal choice of restrictions.  

I am often on reddit's /r/keto and fellow dieters told me of a \"Hidden Menu\" Panera offers to its customers. I was delighted! I didn't want to hold up the lines or look silly so I came prepared with the website's secret menu on my phone. Having my phone at hand I got to the counter and asked for the Power Mediterranean Chicken Salad. Instantly, the waiter looked at me as if I was causing problems at the restaurant. She huffed and said \"no no no\". I held out my phone and showed her what I wanted and she kept shaking her head. I mean really? They didn't even try to figure out what I wanted to order.

If that wasn't bad enough I felt so rushed and it wasn't even busy! I quickly asked for a Caesar salad without croutons. It came out with. The portion was disappointing and I just felt sad at the end of my meal. I'm not sure if I can post links in my review, but if you take the time to look at the Panera website you can find the not-so-hidden \"Hidden Menu\" very easily. Those options look so good! 

Perhaps it was just this location. I'll try out the one on Younge and Dundas next time."}
{"text":"I have given this panera multiple chances and every time I come here I am disappointed and feel it was a waste of money. The outside patio tables are always filthy with dirty dishes, the lettuce is always wilted, they don't even dress the sandwiches correctly and never fail to mess up my order."}
{"text":"Poor customer service Angellyna help me in the front. My whole order wrong very disappointing and went back to try to fix it and she didn't. Don't think I'll come to this Panera Bread ever again."}
{"text":"Yes they're a chain but still really good food! Staff has been great every time."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying not every single time I go is horrible...but 9/10 times it is. I LOVE panera. It has always been my favorite of all the sandwich places everywhere I have lived except here. This panera is slow, they consistently get my order wrong, they are always out of things, when I go to the drive thru it's extremely slow..and then when I look into the window I see people dancing, dropping stuff on the ground, list goes on. My most recent disappointment was when I ordered $50 worth of food. The order was 100% wrong. They definitely handed me someone else's 15 dollar order and someone else got mine. I went back and just got a \"sorry pull forward\". I tried to call the store to speak with the manager and he was unable to talk so I complained to the head office. They tried to make it better by offering a $10 voucher to panera. So in their eyes, repeated bad experiences were excusable with $10, which might I add can't buy a full meal. Disappointed all the way around with panera. They don't have the customers best interest in mind. The least they could do is double check the order. I have gotten the wrong order almost every time I go here. Never again"}
{"text":"We have been here several times while traveling to the area for multiple sports events. Other times have been okay, just always crowded and convenient parking is at a minimum. Unfortunately, this time they lost our kiosk order. After about 30 mins of waiting and while the rest of the team was served, I check on the order. They made no attempt to rectify the problem, only asked each other...\"do you have an order '28' , no, \"do you have a '28', no\" all while making everyone else's order....and basically ignoring me. It took me asking for at least my son's mac and cheese so he could eat and get back to the fields. Finally, it wasn't till  another visit to the food counter that the general manager finally asked what I ordered, which he then fixed it at that moment. I forgot the cookie we ordered since I was in a hurry and not too happy. He said he would cancel the order in the system and I would not have to pay. Hmmmm, not sure how he would do that when they couldn't even FIND the order. Of course, when I checked my AMEX account, the Panera charge of $27.98 is there. Next time we will visit a different restaurant. I gave it two stars only because my son said the mac and cheese was good."}
{"text":"I'm here frequently for lunch because I work nearby. This location is mixed in with a bunch of other \"quick eat\" places nearby. Panera is always good but the different locations can be hit or miss. I will say that this place is in an extremely busy area. There are a lot of professionals who work in the area and it can get outrageously busy. I usually order for pick-up for lunch cause of time.

It becomes hit or miss here. Sometimes my food will be ready and sometimes they will have no record of it. I have ended up spending half my lunch time there just waiting for them to actually get it ready. Otherwise, food is ready and i'm in and out within 5 minutes. They recently renovated and have plentiful seating, there is no shortage of staff EVER and the bakery is fresh and stocked full with goodies. All-in-all, a great lunch spot and an exceptionally clean and quick location!"}
{"text":"I came by here today to grab a quick lunch to go. Well, clearly I am a naive and hopeful optimist because there was nothing quick about this lunch. Even though I got here at 11:45AM, it was already packed. There wasn't much of a line at the cashier so I was still hopeful, but it took around 20 minutes for my chicken salad sandwich to be prepared. That is not the kind of wait you expect for a sandwich joint. 

My sandwich was suffering from a severe protein deficiency. There was about a quarter inch of \"chicken salad\" on the sandwich and the bulk of it was grapes. The chicken was almost non-existent. No wonder they feel the need to give you chips or more bread with your sandwich since the protein certainly isn't going to fill you up. If I'm paying approximate $10 for a sandwich, I expect a good amount of protein. Not impressed at all. The pickle was really good though. I give them two stars for the pickle. No stars for the skimpy chicken."}
{"text":"I went there a few times for muffins love muffins this time I went for breakfast got me the Asiago Breakfasr sandwich and OJ then went for a Turkey Bacon Bravo panini with a clam chowder soup. So far I had a good experience there. I will go back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience here. I didn't check-in the last time I visited this location even though it took a very long time to get my food for lunch. I figured they just opened it was lunch time etc. ( this was weeks ago). Today, I came in to get a sandwich. I figured it was after the lunch rush hour and it shouldn't take long. I was so wrong. I waited for my food for over 20 mins. And I even had to ask about my order or else I would've been there longer than that. The reason I even decided to write this review and rate this location is because after all of that, they gave me the wrong order . I had to hurry back to work so I didn't realize it until I sat down to eat at my desk. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Delivery came in this..i ordered a soup they forgot to put broth into it. They have to double check specially for delivery. Not a pleasant exoerience for this amount of money"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the quinoa mediterranean salad and turkey, cheese avocado panini. Food was very fresh, flavorful and priced right.  Service was fast and friendly.  Servings size was just right.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Went here this morning to pick up an order for work.  Girl behind counter had her back to me and didn't greet me.  She finally turned around to say she'd be with me in a minute, with the personality of someone going for a colonoscopy.  I told her what the order was under, she tells me o.k. Can't find the order, finds it, then has to take more time to ask her fellow employee if the order is complete.  When the employee says yes, she has me sign the receipt.  But wait there's more. After signing the receipt, she then has to ask the same employee what copy I get- unbelievable!  I know Panera is part of the trendy, supposedly better for you, fast-casual family, but instead of spending all that money on those damn commercials touting their clean salads, put some money into training the incompetent staff.  Oh and they forgot to give me the cream cheese for the bagels-Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"As a loyal Paradise customer it baffles me how poorly the bakery is run at this location.  Literally 8 out of 10 times I am there to pick up lunch there are not chippers- or if there are only a few choices.  People on line do a great job as do cashiers - good is consistent ."}
{"text":"I'm a glutton for punishment. Sooo slow!!  Stuck in the drive thru waiting on chai.  I will be late now."}
{"text":"Normally this place is awesome, occasionally packed but worth the wait.  Today not so great! Not just out of one thing today but 4! they didn't have chicken noodle soup,macaroni and cheese, onion soup or green tea. Then they said onion soup isn't a Sunday soup, even though it's on the menu online for Sunday. After I paid I realized they were out of tea, and the kid said oh yes we're  waiting for a shipment. Be out one thing ok fine but 4 things is ridiculous. Some one did horrible job when ordering this week!  I should have asked for a refund and went to Zuppas! Definitely disappointed in today's  trip to Panera!"}
{"text":"Was at this location the other night. Had a chicken soup and an iced tea. the piece of bread that came with the soup was old as if it had been made hours before. The soup had a taste as if had just been popped out of a Progresso can! I asked for  plain old saltine crackers for my soup, only to be told that didn't have any. Requested some butter for my bread, after some digging they came up with some. The black iced tea machine was about empty so that was limited. It was evening about 700pm. 

I got the feeling the staff just wanted to close up and go home. In the mornings this is a good place to eat. I guess the staff is more motivated and awake versus the evening hours!!"}
{"text":"I love Panera but this is really annoying...I order a bagel toasted with cream cheese and they gave me ONE of those dumb plastic cream cheese  containers that barely covers half the bagel. not nearly enough cream cheese and I have to do it myself. Einstein bagels trumps you there, they give you a lot more cream cheese and they do it for you. Smh :("}
{"text":"Driving through here on a trip . Kids mac and cheese was so watery it was like macaroni and water ... poorly constructed sandwich that I ordered  and the grilled cheese was not grilled on the other side . Really disappointing!"}
{"text":"Meh.  It's okay.   I got the pick two with 1/2 of a tomato and mozzarella panini and the new cream of mushroom soup with a lemonade.  I looove mushrooms but this soup is not good.   Totally unimpressed.  The panini was decent. ..same as always.   I remember their food being waaay better."}
{"text":"I love Panera Bread. The food is fresh and really good and the service is quick. They're also super reliable, the food is about the same at any Panera bread."}
{"text":"I love Panera food. I really do. But they royally screwed up. My husband and I came to eat there on a Sunday afternoon. I got a chicken panini and my husband got a chicken Cesar salad. Got our food. Sat down. He had no chicken. 'Okay,' you think, 'that's not a big problem.' He was able to get the chicken for his salad. 
Well, we were also picking up food to bring home to my parents. Ordered their food and was asked to wait down at the other end. In front of us was a lady who was missing several items out of her order. We were kind of thinking to ourselves 'that's lame.' Got the food and I looked at it and saw we were missing two pecan rolls. Asked about it and they said it was up front.  I remarked \" she said everything would be down here.\" They said no all pastries are up front. I'm like \"okay.\" Go up and find our pecan rolls on the counter just sitting there. Grab it and go. Run to target next door and head home. I should have looked even better. The grilled cheese for the pick two with soup was not there. My mom was upset she had no  sandwich to go with her soup, my husband angrily leaves to go pick up the $10 half of bread and cheese. It's meager things I know, but it's annoying to keep having to ask for your food. Like I said, I love Panera food, but these teens gotta pay attention."}
{"text":"Sewer smell has been there since they opened this location, it appears that it is not being addressed... we just walked out today without eating.  Please notify your customers when you have this resolved."}
{"text":"Yes, another wildly popular US chain landed in this plaza. I just wish chipotle is here as well. 

This is a nice place for coffee, soup, sandwiches & salad. There isn't a similar restaurant in the same area. Service is good but on the slow side, I saw a staff helping a patron is to setup her wifi. I hope the speed will improve. 

I usually have a coffee plus the \"pick 2\" combo, which include 2 of the 1/2 size salad, 1/2 soup or 1/2 sandwich for about ~$15. It's a little bit more expensive than other sandwich shop, but I guess the environment and quality make up for that. 

I usually grab a few Asiago bagel on my way out, the bagel is quite nice and surprisingly cheaper than tim horton's bagel."}
{"text":"I won't eat at this Panera again. I ordered their Turkey Chili, which I've had several times before, but this time it tasted like they way overdid the spices. I asked an employee and she shrugged her shoulders and walked up. I ate as much as I could then went up to the counter. I told them I couldn't eat it all as it was too spicy. I asked for a to-go container. Maybe I wasn't direct enough,but she should have picked up that I wasn't happy with the meal. I waited about 3-4 minutes for her to return to the counter (not my table) with a to-go container. Unacceptable. 

My wife had ordered the Kale and Quinoa salad, but they left out the Quinoa. When she asked about it they first said it was in there, but on further inspection found it was not mixed in. They gave her a side of Quinoa. 

On their receipt it says that if the order is not correct they will promptly fix it and give you a pastry for your troubles.  They did neither. 

I like Panera, but as for this location it is off my list."}
{"text":"Oh Panera - you have won my heart again, yummy food and great service.  Hello did I mention free wifi!  This Panera location is my location to get work done when I am feeling a bit stir-crazy at home.

Free refills on coffee if you dine-in!  

Make Panera Bread you stop if you are in the west-end!"}
{"text":"I come here all of the time. Seriously though, my tip for EVERYONE is if you're starving and it's your lunch time, you're better off ordering for pickup. That way you get your food, have your lunch ready, and then you'll be on your way. I don't recommend you coming here around the lunch hour unless you have time to spare. But I'm never disappointed. I always get the pick 2! The Green Goddess Cobb Salad with Chicken and a Chicken Noodle Soup! It's always delicious and never disappoints me. I really like their pumpkin spice latte and the green power smoothie! I've also had their broth bowls. If you're looking for broth bowls... try to avoid the Asian style one it's way too sour and it's really not good... I did not enjoy it. Their flat breads and paninis are good and their Honey Walnut cream cheese spread is DEEEELICIOUS!!! Also, if you come here often, get a Panera rewards card! Trust me! Last year I had free chicken noodle soup for an entire month! It was AWESOME! Don't forget they deliver in the Madison area!! Which was the best idea ever!!!"}
{"text":"I hate this Panera! These people don't seem to know how to follow simple instructions. I've received moldy bread from here before as well. I've never had an issue with any other Panera. Wish I could give 0 stars."}
{"text":"Great food,  great service.  Everyone there is very friendly. French onion soup is amazing!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Panera when I first moved to Missouri in 2001. It was a standard out there for office party treats or a mall lunch. When I moved back West, it was nice to see it again.

When my daughter went to high school, I used to call in and have her Friday lunch treat ready for me to pick up. It was nice that they had lunch items ready to pick up before 11:00 AM. If we have houseguests, I usually pick up an assortment of bagels and pastries then replate them, which always goes well and you don't have to cook in the morning;).

The pastries and bagels are good, especially the scones and is well complimented with a plain cup of coffee. One household and office fave were the French toast bagels, as they were the first to go. I'm not too fond of their specialty coffees that are sweet. In my opinion, they are a bit too sweet. 

The location is off of Eastern and there is ample parking. You can always call in your order if you are doing take away. It's very convenient.

ALSO, take advantage of their Panera card. You do get free items like a pastry or bagel. With the card, you also get a free birthday pasty which I took advantage of today."}
{"text":"We ordered Panera catering \"Assorted breakfast sandwiches\"  for a safety meeting at work and it was quite a treat. The sandwiches were delivered warm and were quite delicious.   All the ingredients were fresh and each sandwich was individually wrapped.   I really liked the steak egg and cheese.. it was da bomb baby!   Thanks Panera."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Panera. Providence Rd. makes the best Frozen Caramels! No ice chunks lol"}
{"text":"This is a tough one to rate.  \"Yay! I'm a fan\" covers the food but not their rapid pickup service.  Today was my third time using it and the third time they left things out.  Last time I was already home before I discovered it.  Today I checked before I left.  How do you forget a bread bowl in an order for soup in a bread bowl?  Someone is asleep at the wheel.  If you offer a service like the rapid pickup, it would be nice if you paid attention to the order.  As for the food, I do like Panera.  Some things are a bit overpriced but the soup has always been good (will we ever see the wild mushroom soup again?), salads are delicious, the breads are all excellent, the bagels are not real bagels (like New York bagels) but they are good nonetheless, the pastry is great, and the sandwiches quite good (Why did they ever discontinue the Grown-Up Grilled Cheese? Yummy.)  Fortunately I do have the recipe for it. So, enjoy good food at Panera but if you get takeout, check the bag!!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened the customer service was horrendous. I stopped going there. Stayed away for years. I recently started going again as it is on my way to work. And I have to say the customer service has been outstanding my emails of complaints helped.
The bagels are good. The breakfast sandwiches are also pretty good. But the 4 cheese souffle, now that is the shining star.It is so flaky and soft, the flavor incredible. I think 4.00 for 1 is a bit much. But for that occasional treat well worth the price. 
Bravo to the staff, always very friendly."}
{"text":"This Paradise Bakery location has ample seating and a very large menu.  They offer a wide variety from breakfast sandwiches and bagels to soups, hot sandwiches, and salads.  With a/c and free wifi, PB&C provides a great reprieve from the heat.  There are plenty of outlets to fuel your electronics as well.

The salads are pretty good.   PB&C seems to have a wider variety of sweets -- mini desserts (for guilt-free indulgence) as well as the usual selection of cookies and cake slices.   Though, on a recent visit, I had the Tomato Mozzarella half sandwich and it was just very salty.  I didn't even finish it.  The soups come with a cute, perfectly baked sweet roll.  Unfortunately, the sweet roll didn't taste very good with my broccoli cheddar soup.  (baguettes seem to pair better with creamy soups).    Though a nice little perk is that a chocolate chip cookie comes with the combo meal, whether you want it or not.   So, to me, some items are hit or miss.  The Thai chicken salad actually was very tasty to me.  

Service is somewhat speedy.  You go through a line: sandwiches, salads, then soups.  Bussing service is super quick.  They are very attentive without rushing you.  Quick and easy to find a clean table and dirty dishes aren't sitting out on the tables for long.  

Though similar to the Panera chain, your Panera rewards card will not be accepted at Paradise Bakery & Cafe.  

The other reviews are correct though, that this location gets pretty packed.  So if coming for lunch, come early or arrive late -- as I always say with any of my lunch reviews."}
{"text":"I just want to say how incredibly greatful I am to the staff for fixing my order. I did a rapid order pick up and for some reason the app changed the location. I work here in arrowhead and have it saved but I spoke with the manager to show my email with the confermation and they worked it out. Thank you so much Azenet!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty average. They have very good sandwiches and soups. I like going here, but I am not satisfied when leaving and it costly for you get. I am a green tea fan and the green tea here is the worst. It does not taste like green tea at all, it taste like sugar apple juice. The staff here are friendly and overall it's a good environment."}
{"text":"Solid choice for something quick, fresh and relatively healthy. They are always fast - a short lunch hour has never been an issue here.

My favorite is getting a panini with their tomato soup to dip it in!"}
{"text":"Mykee is the man! There was cilantro in my salad (hate it so much) and he quickly got it fixed and apologized over and over again, came and checked on us multiple times. Really appreciate him and his customer service! Thank you Mykee!"}
{"text":"Food 4, service/automation 1. I love soup... There, I said it out loud. And Panera soup is really nicely done. But TWICE I have used the \"Rapid Ready pick up your own food\" part of the app and been disappointed with the timing. The first time, they never even RECEIVED my order at the store. I had to show them on my phone what I had ordered and then they put it together on the fly while acting like I had done something wrong. 

The second time, I took their \"Ready in 8 minutes\" literally. Showed up at 10 minutes and no food. Waited for another 10 before it was ready. So, more than twice as long as anticipated...to pour a bowl of soup... I have to assume that it's faster just to walk in than to order ahead. 

Panera: I can't quit your soup, but I'm divorcing your app."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong. The food is always delicious. However, they are pretty expensive for a place that cooks all the paninis at 6 in the morning and then leaves them in a fridge for the day. 

They also overcharge for the soup considering the fact that is has been frozen in a bag for a few days and then warmed up in warm water. 

They do have the loyalty card which does come in handy but you have to be a regular customer to actually receive good rewards."}
{"text":"We work in the Hughes Center and the restaurant is convenient, however their take out food is always very sloppy prepared. Not to mention it took them 25 min to make a sandwich ... and the place was practically empty!! Very ... Very  disappointed. I will not go back to Panera as there's many other restaurant in the area to chose from, just wanted to give them one more opportunity to prepare a good sandwich."}
{"text":"I had one bad experience here where they gave me cold food. When I asked for it to be warmed, they pointed to a microwave and said have at it. 9 dollars for cold pasta??? I decided to give them one more shot. I order a soup which they filled the bowl only 1/4 of the way full and the bowl had obviously not been washed."}
{"text":"I had not been to this Panera for a while, but I felt a craving for Panera's turkey chili.  So, my boyfriend and I shared a meal here.

I usually cannot finish a whole salad.  So, I split the Citrus Cashew Chicken Salad with my guy.  It was good, but I prefer the Fuji Apple Chicken Salad.

He did not feel like the turkey chili.  So, I ate most of it and some of the salad.

I did not feel like a drink.  So, I just got a water cup.  My guy likes the selection of iced teas here.  So, he ordered a regular drink, which he proceeded to use to concoct a drink from 3-4 of the dispensers at the self-serve drink section.

We also ordered an Apple Crunch Muffin, which was yummy.

Overall, we spent just $20.45, and the food was good.

The staff was slammed, but they did their best to bring out our order as fast as they could."}
{"text":"I like the food and haven't had a bad experience yet until today and it seems many others were too.  You can tell who does their job well but the one I got today that seemed like she didn't want to be there. First time ordering bread and didn't realize their were two different sizes.  Well you would think that they would ask which one instead of assuming. Anyway, I ended up getting stuck with both sizes because she rung up the wrong one.  Really?  The quality though was great."}
{"text":"I was in this cafe with a friend to discuss business, I wanted a chicken-vegetable soup I saw online, as much as the cashier tried she wasn't able to identify my choice and out of frustration I decided I wasn't going to eat again but just went ahead with our business meeting. Luckily my guest was able to make a choice. Her food was served by the shift supervisor who asked if that is all we wanted. I explained what happened and he first of all apologized and took my order. Not long after he brought my soup which I really enjoyed but wait that wasn't all, the most interesting part was yet to come, he wasn't taking any payment for the order, he offered the food free, making it up for the misunderstanding with the cashier. I couldn't believe it but that art of courtesy made my day. The most profound thing from a team leader is worth mentioning and is commendable. Hey Terran (sorry if I couldn't make out the name) you are doing a wonderful job, keep it up, all my friends will hear this. Thank you and your team."}
{"text":"The portions for takeout are not the same as eat in. Half salad and soup take home was a teeny tiny with no noodles in my soup and just a few bites of salad. This hardly compares to the generous bowl of salad you get when you eat in."}
{"text":"See the pic I posted to see what I opened when I ordered a half ham sandwich. Now, I don't expect a 5 star presentation from a sandwich shop, but I do expect more than something thrown together and squished. Two stars because it still tasted good... After I reassembled it."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the past three times, they are out of what I want. Want broccoli cheese soup? Doesn't matter they don't have it. Want a bread bowl? Doesn't matter hey don't have it.... seriously? You just lost a customer, I'm done trying and the cashier didn't even care. I'm taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very very bad service.
Only two tables inside and they forgot to bring us our order outside. We had 2 hot breakfast sandwiches and a 2 hot beverages. When I drew the cashier's attention to the fact that we hadn't received our order (over 10 minutes waiting) she actually read on the takeaway screen that we had been waiting 16 minutes. They brought our order out my sausage sandwich was warm. My husband's egg was stone cold inside his bacon sandwich. I had to send my latte back after tasting it, as it was lukewarm.
Very, very bad service."}
{"text":"I order here a few times when I work downtown and at first (before delivery was available) I ordered my usual pick 2 (as I would @ the East Side location) and I was not happy with my Cobb Salad... it was just not as presentable and flavorful like it should be. I was really disappointed. But I figured I would give this place another shot after I heard about the delivery option and Wow! I like consistency with business because then I would know exactly what to expect when I get my food! I was extremely happy with my meal and I even got a cookie from the delivery driver which made my day! I gave this place 4 stars because I had hope for them when I ordered from here the second time. I wish they had it right the first time though! The delivery was as expected, between 30-45 minutes and my order was on point! I've ordered delivery from this location every time I work downtown and now, I'm a happy camper!"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Panera since they first showed up on campus many years ago on John Street.  I prefer patronizing the paces off campus where you can get seats.  On campus, students take up space doing homework while diners walk around looking for seats.  The food is good.  The sandwichs are interesting and tasty.  The soups are mostly good, especially in a bread bowl.  Salads are also tasty and you can mix and match the sandwich, soup, and salads.  The Mediterranean Veggie is a fav, but the consistency of its assembly leaves much to be desired.  Sometimes it's sloppily slapped together and may be missing an ingredient or have a small amount of it.  The Baked Potato soup is quite good.  The seasonal Wild Mushroom soup is awesome.  They've had some other great soups on occasion, like Fire Roasted Corn.  The bagel selection is good but they're really nothing like New York bagels.  More bread than bagel.  The breads are excellent and the bakery items decadent.  Great Bear Claws and Danish and the Cobblestones are pretty good, though sometimes dry.  The Cinnamon Rolls are good in the centers but the outer edges are usally dry."}
{"text":"Had a salad and a soup and it tasted amazing!! The food was really fresh and the place was very clean with a lot of seating."}
{"text":"This is the absolutely the worst Panera...ever! They always, always, always get my order wrong. They're completely inefficient. The manager is nice & apologetic but the next time, mistake again. It's almost appalling...but now it's expected. If I didn't work so close, have a short lunch, and pick up for other co-workers, I'd never return."}
{"text":"Unless you want to send someone to go find a employee after waiting 15 minutes THEN DO NOT COME HERE. I'm so upset by the rude employee that finally came to help us and the general wait that would probably have never ended if we didn't send some from our group to go get someone that I needed to write this review. I'm so angry that I didn't even order because I lost any hunger I had. Not only is there terrible customer service but the food is obviously not fresh and way too salty for anyone."}
{"text":"This place is a regular morning stop in Vegas and I've yet to find something here that I don't like. The chocolate croissants, the quiches and the apple chicken salad are fantastic. So is the tomato soup at lunch."}
{"text":"I was so skeptical of Panera before I walked in, pegging it for overpriced sandwiches and pastries. Well it is, but they're also really really delicious overpriced sandwiches and pastries.

I really like the pecan bun, it's like a cinnamon rolls but covered in mounds of toasted pecans.  And all the breads I've tried there are really good, fresh loaves.

This location in particular seems to always have seating when I stop by, it's clean, and no complaints about the staff."}
{"text":"Pinto was awesome. My girlfriend ordered a bread bowl with broccoli cheddar soup, and it wasn't really carved out and wasn't a ton of soup. So i went up and asked asked for an extra side of soup and Pinto gave us a whole other bread bowl! My girlfriend was very pleased :)"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh ingredients! Now they offer delivery, which is awesome! I downloaded their app and was able to order dinner to be delivered in the day and time I wanted. It even accepts paypal!"}
{"text":"I ordered the steak and white cheddar panini, the half size. What I actually got was a kiddie size!!! It was too small for the $7 I paid for it!!! I made a complaint and they made me a SLIGHTLY bigger one, but it was horrible. The bread was too hard, I had to pull it while eating it and I did not enjoy it at all. What made it worse was that the employees were all so miserable. No one likes their job there! They all seemed so grumpy and unhappy. The vibe just wasn't great and it was our first experience there. The only thing that made up for it was the pastries which we warmed up in the microwave."}
{"text":"One star... this is where we begin. Let's go to management, they are booty, and don't call you back(not speaking from personal experience). Next the food comes out of frozen bags, so all you white people who go there thinking your getting a fresh lunch, your wrong, sorry. What else, overall booty restaurant. 

Ps I'm white"}
{"text":"Didn't expect there to be so many bad reviews for this location! I've been to several other locations, but this was my first time here. Overall, no complaints on the quality of food or cleanliness of the location. If I had to agree with any of the other coments, it would be the service of the staff. 

Standing by the menu board, I was trying to decide on what to eat. When the customer in front of me had finished taking their order, I proceeded to walk toward the cashier to tell him what I wanted. He promptly left the desk and spoke to another employee without telling me what was happening. I found this rude but didn't mention it at the time. The girl he was talking to then took my order but did not apologize. Other than this strange occurrence, there wasn't anything else wrong with the visit. My Strawberry Poppyseed Chicken salad was amazing!"}
{"text":"Came to have a quick check in meeting on a friday evening. Seating was plenty. Bakery items were few but the soup was plenty. Didn't care for my turkey apple cheddar sandwich. The staff was nice."}
{"text":"I'm commenting specifically on their delivery service.  I've ordered twice for home delivery, and both times items were wrong and /or missing.  The check-off sheet they supposedly use to verify correctness and completeness of your order is a joke .. items are checked off but not there, and the \"order checked by\" line is left blank.  
 I agree with another poster that the management appears to be the problem.  After calling immediately to report our order being short, I was told BY THE MANAGER ON DUTY that an appropriate credit would be given.  It never appeared.  And when I contacted corporate Customer Service some days later, they confirmed a credit /refund was never put through.  They made it better, but obviously the Arboretum site is a problem. 
 My advice:  go up the road another couple miles toward Matthews and use the Panera near Target."}
{"text":"Plenty of seating area for all Panera guests! I can only imagine how many students visit this location during the school year since it's near the college! It would be nice to study in here since there are some quieter areas. 

We came to Panera for breakfast and ordered the steel cut oatmeal, power sandwich with egg whites, avocado, and spinach, and four cheese souffle. My hubby loves their souffle and is delicious. It is made out of buttery puff pastry and has cheese and egg inside of it. Yum! The steel cut oatmeal and the power sandwich are pretty decent. I also got a cinnamon roll to go for free because I had a free birthday pastry to use from being a Panera rewards member. It is huge and can easily be split between two people."}
{"text":"Very few electric outlets if you need to work or recharge - surprising for a larger Panera. But this is a problem for many Panera locations. Otherwise your run-of-the-mill Panera offering same as all others. My favorites on the menu are power breakfast sandwich, southwest chile salad and of course the black bean soup. Install more outlets & I'd come back more often!!!"}
{"text":"After enjoying a great lunch there I decided to place another order for takeout to bring to my husband at work. Because it was during midweek lunch hour they were busy and extremely slow with my order. When I was finally handed my order I was now in a hurry so I didn't check the bag and just dropped it off to my husband's job but, I soon got a call from him that it was not the right order. I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager Luke and explained what happen and he promised me a complimentary meal on my next visit. A few weeks later I finally went back for lunch and Luke kept his promise and everything was prompt and delicious."}
{"text":"The food and service were fine on my recent visit, but I stopped going to Panera Bread locations in this region when I read the news stories about racial discrimination in terms of hiring and employee advancement. I recently visited again when a work function dictated that I do so. I observed that little has changed in terms of the diversity of the staff, so I will continue to avoid these locations until I see positive change."}
{"text":"I am sick of coming in to this location and they are out of bagels. If they know that \"everything\" bagels are popular then why don't they make more? Not a week goes by that they are out of them by 10:30 a.m. The last straw was today! It was 11:15 a.m. and I asked the cashier for an everything bagel and she said they just came out of the oven and they will fall apart so she said she couldn't slice them yet. I told her I would sit down while they cool off and come back in 10 minutes. I came back in 10 minutes and the woman in line in front of me ordered all of the everything bagels! I was livid! The cashier gave me some lame excuse. I left the place and went up the street and had lunch at a Chinese restaurant where they know how to treat their customers without screwing them!"}
{"text":"As with any chain, Panera Bread has trouble getting more than 3 stars for me. 

But, yeah man, woooo Panera! I just love getting soup and sandwiches! Panera is good, obviously, and I have no complaints! At this particular location, I got quick and friendly service and my soup was delicious. 

The only problem: it was downright icy in there! We were having one of those super fall days that ended up being over 75 degrees, so I was wearing a nice fall dress. Bad idea! It's winter in Panera!"}
{"text":"I work at a panera location close by and asked for cups for water if I could have the medium size (because we get any self serve drinks for free) the manager was very rude and unprofessional he kept telling me he would call the panera I work at and ask them if I worked there. He was trying to threaten me or something when I have been working there for quite some time now. I just think that they need to get some more professional managers in there. Poor customer service!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped for lunch.  A new menu with new items and new prices.  Of course our choices are no longer available.  So we picked something.  I had a 1/2 Italian sandwich and cup of soup and a soda. The wife had a 1/2 Sierra turkey sandwich and cup of soup and a soda.   The price was $22.95.   What a major disappointment.  Food was marginal and price was outrageous.    It will be a long time before returning.  Shame on Panera."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for about 4 years (since it was a Paradise Bakery). I would definitely recommend using the app/website for their \"Rapid Pickup\". It's nice being able to place the exact order online, walk in, pick up your bag without talking to anyone, and walk out. You can literally be in the store less than 20 seconds. Makes it a good option for grabbing food on the way home. I mostly stick to the Southwest Caesar Salad which I highly recommend. Never had a problem with food quality, though other reviews are correct, it definitely gets busy at lunch."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat at. Whether I am grabbing dinner on my way home or spending a night out with my wife, I have always left the restaurant satisfied. Panera has healthy food; the menus are clearly displayed behind the cash registers. Furthermore, the calories are listed for each item. After one receives their food, Panera has good accomodations--whether you are dining alone or with a group; there are booths, tables, large tables, and small booths. The atmosphere is great; there is soft music in the background and the lighting is soft. I have personally used Panera for means with family, friends, meetings, and personal gatherings. The inviting atmosphere and ample room is also convenient if you are one looking for a good meal and a place to work. The Wi-Fi makes it convenient to use a lap-top / notebook / iPad to do work in a new place. Overall, I have visited this restaurant about many times in the past year and have no plans of stopping anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Came in a 8:15pm yesterday to get a salad and three front staff were busy talking smack.  One saw me and said someone will be with you then went back to the other two to talk some more.  I stood there for another 5 minutes, then leave.  I guess this is why you will always be making minimum wage!  I'm not going back to this particular location."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews for chain restaurants like this but , I received amazing customer service at this location. I'm not sure of the girl's name that help me but, she had red hair and her customer service was amazing ! She was very through, polite and patient while taking my order. Usually they don't ask if you want apple, bread or chips for each thing they just give you whatever but, she asked with each item and was very sweet about it. The food was also delicious like always. The green goddess salad is to die for but, honestly the customer service made the food tastes a thousand times better. I will defentliey be returning to this location and I hope Panera invest in more people like this young lady !"}
{"text":"My friend brought me here go hang out. It's a really nice place to hang out. It was my first time here and I've never heard of it. I looked up on yelp to see what was popular. I saw the broccoli cheddar soup seemed to be popular so I ordered that in a bread bowl and I was reallllly craving a strawberry banana smoothie...bit they only had strawberry smoothies so I ordered that. 
I don't think this is a good place for me because I HATE bread. The soup was good but not great like everyone here is saying. I couldn't eat the bread bowl it was too hard. The smoothie was delicious but it was 10 dollars all together. Didn't like that. 
Not sure if anything else is great but I don't really like sandwiches either so I doubt I'll ever be coming back. Don't see how it's popular or has such a good rating."}
{"text":"Food is not bad but the portions suck! I even went up to ask to fill the bowl more and the dude said that's three scoops and we use these bowls for salads as well. Okay that is nice you used 1/3 cup scoops and made one cup in a bowl it is still not enough. Inflation is caused by these businesses I swear because I just paid $13 for an $8 dollar meal."}
{"text":"Surly employees.  No spoon or napkins provided for to-go soup (I had to ask).  Tiny tiny portion of soup for bread bowl.  No cookie, but choice of an apple (ugh!), generic plain chips, or a baguette (rock hard hunk of bread).  Cream of chicken with wild rice soup was same as always, fine, and the bread bowl was edible.

I miss Paradise so much and apparently everyone else does too as it was absolutely dead inside, and plastered with help wanted signs, while Fired Pie and Los Taquitos are pulling in a brisk late dinner business."}
{"text":"Panera food is good and I hate giving two stars for other stuff but I'm really frustrated. I came here for breakfast and wifi. The breakfast sandwich was great. The wifi sucked because it couldn't handle the shear number of laptops all trying to hook up on the wifi signal. My web pages were timing out so much that I decided to count how many laptops were open and running in the place, 15 !!!!!!! This has turned out to be a workplace ghetto for mobile workers. Time for Panera to take it up a notch. Boost your wifi capacity and advertise that this place is a great place to get online AND eat."}
{"text":"Had a decent time meeting up with friends here on our way home from GA.  Our drinks, salads and sandwiches were exactly as we expected.  No evil eyes for hanging out after we were finished with our food.  Coffee is fresh!  If you like Panera, then this will meet your expectations."}
{"text":"Horrible! Just paid 9$ for a cup of soup..... No sandwich at all. Worst ever! Will never go back. All the customers were confused on the order and where to go. So Lunch ruined thanks to this place! Waste of a lunch break to get it"}
{"text":"They forgot my soup. 

I ordered a Cranberry-Orange muffin and was instead given, a muffin shaped piece of cornbread. 

It was a terrible muffin but pretty good cornbread."}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience ever!  While waiting for my to go order I sat and listened to the back kitchen staff butcher my name and my a joke of it. The unfortunate thing was the kitchen manager was a part of the conversation. Out of this pack of buffoons there was one gentleman who attempted to correct is fellow coworkers. Kuddos to this young man!  The rest of the idiots spoke of \"ethnic names and poor accents\" and even went so far as making insensitive jokes about Hispanic dialect. This inappropriate conversation went on for a good 10 minutes before I jumped in to correct them.  Upon realizing that we over heard the insensitive comments the kitchen manager immediately ran to the store manager to clean up the mess he had created. While waiting for the store manager one of the employees, Ashley who was a part of this little group made a feeble attempt to apologize for her part in this unfortunate situation.  This behavior was not only culturally bias in nature but unprofessional, offensive and lacked customer service. Congrats, hates off to Panera for employing a great group of court jesters!"}
{"text":"Great Panera 
Bread place on the Queensway next to Sherway Gardens. Nice staff, Linda at the cash was fantastic. Thank you. Great ,clean and very good food. Will come again."}
{"text":"Even though I still have a free dinner left in my card, I don't think I will go back.  Every time I go there they are always out of the soups and Mac and cheese, which is what my daughter wants. The food that we do get is just alright. The service is alright, they always seem miserable at this location.  I only go once every few month but every time I'm disappointed. I think this was the last though. Good luck and maybe the breakfast service is better, I've never been there in the morning."}
{"text":"The tables were very dirty as well as the dine in silverware. We had to ask for plastics during our dine in.. the mop held a stench that was difficult to smell while dining. The food is very over priced for what the menu offers and a suggestion is more serving sizes for the price. I have had better experiences at different locations but this one was not one I would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"I eat at Panera pretty often as I work nearby (and sometimes I'm too lazy to walk the extra block to the other restaurants). (the first step is to admit your laziness)

For a long time I thought Panera was overpriced, but have come to like it enough that the price points don't bother me so much.  The portions are always sizable but not ridiculously big. I think the quality of the food is decent.  Nothing is fried here and there's ton of good tasting, healthy, fast menu items. 

Menu winners (for me): sausage, egg and cheese ciabatta breakfast sandwich, turkey and avocado BLT, mac and cheese, tomato and fresh mozzarella panini, and chicken cobb salad.  

Menu losers (for me): classic grilled cheese, pasta with basil pesto (arrived in an enormous pool of olive oil/grease that unsuccessfully tried to mop up with napkins - was really gross)

They added a fontina grilled cheese to the menu recently that is incredibly rich but delicious. I'd have a hard time eating a full sandwich without having to call my therapist because of the guilt over the amount of fat I ingested and feeling gross from the amount of cheese. A half with a small salad is perfect. 

I recently had the chicken sorrentino pasta which consists of ravioli, light amount of tomato sauce, fresh spinach, and smoked chicken and some parmesan, I think. It was really, really fantastic. One of the best items I've had there. Not too heavy and had LOTS of flavor. 

My problem with Panera is consistency with food preparation. With the exception of soup or mac and cheese, each time I get something it's different than the time before. For example: I've ordered the tomato mozz panini most often.  I've seen basil on the sandwich about 25% of the time I've ordered it. The pesto will either be slathered on super heavy or almost non-existent. Sometimes there's a TON of sun-dried tomatoes and one or two sad tiny slices of regular tomatoes, and same with the fresh mozz. They need to get that shit together, man. 

At this location, there's tons of seating. You have the option of metered street parking or using a garage behind the building. I believe that they'll waive the fee for 1 hour of parking when you present your Panera receipt.  They also have tables outside near the Detroit Ave. entrance.  Lots of large windows in this space and lots of good people watching. Many interesting folks creepin around this area at any given time. 

The place is always clean. The staff at the registers are friendly and polite. Out of fifty orders, I'd estimate there's been one mistake on an order.

The coffee is kept fresh and tastes good. The other coffee drinks (chai, latte, etc.) are not good. 

Most importantly: They keep the chocolate chip cookies on a warming tray so they're always warm as if they're fresh out of the oven. \"Thanks a lot, Panera! I curse thee\" I yell when I get off my scale each morning.  Your damn cookies are too good and I can't stop with the cookies.  I wish your oven/cookie warmer would break for a few months so I can have a reprieve. (or maybe you can put me on cookie probation or something? Let me know, thanks.)"}
{"text":"I was going to give this place 3 stars, but I don't think it's fair to compare it to L.A. eats (such as Corner Bakery Cafe).  Been here twice.  Stay away from the iced green tea...gross.  The sandwiches are decent but nothing great.  If you've been to a Corner Bakery, don't expect this to be the same quality/level even though they look the same.  They are not  connected (I asked a manager)."}
{"text":"Why do I keep coming here? The grilled cheese is a cheese sandwich that is cold and the chicken noodle soup is somehow sweet which is pretty gross."}
{"text":"The Panera location at Square One is usually a solid experience.

I've come here multiple times for meetings, and I enjoy the ambience of the cafe. One thing that sets it apart from Artisano Bakery is the varying types of seating options. You can either sit at a standard table or get one of the booths that feel almost insulated due to how high the partitions are. It's a great feature for anyone who doesn't want to listen to the people talking loudly behind them.

I've only been here for breakfast specials, but their $6.99 early-morning option is usually filling and well-varied (with the sandwiches being quite good). I also enjoy having the option to fill my own coffee/tea, which is something I haven't seen at many other places.

It's definitely a place to check out if you're going with family, on a date or just want to check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Panera Bread has always been my go-to spot for soups and sandwiches.  Although this is not the location I usually go to, this is where I went today.

The last time I came in here it was extremely hot.  The AC was broken and it was over 100 outside so we left.  This time it was still hot, but not as bad as last time.  Should look into getting this fixed/lowering the temp.  

I almost always get the same thing here.  A U-Pick-2 with cheddar broccoli soup, a plain tuna sandwich on a french baguette, and a side of bread.  Their cheddar broccoli soup is amazing!!  And the prices are fair. 

I came in with my friend today.  Service was friendly, but both of our sandwich orders were wrong.  First they brought out my friend's sandwich and forgot to add avocado.  While they were fixing it, I looked at my receipt and didn't see \"plain\" anywhere, so I knew my order was going to be messed up (although the cashier did repeat back \"plain\" to me).  When my friend's sandwich was brought back out, the lady asked to see my receipt, took it with her, and returned back 5 minutes later with my food.  I am guessing they forgot about mine or lost the ticket.  My sandwich wasn't plain.  Maybe I should have double checked with her when she took my receipt and left with it, I don't know.. 

When we were headed out, the lady that took our order said \"Thanks!!\"  It was pretty funny, my friend and I both mumbled \"For getting both of our orders wrong.\"  Still a Panera fan, but this location needs some improvements."}
{"text":"Hmmmm it's Panera Bread.... Clean but somewhat stark and unfriendly environment. I enjoy the cinnamon crunch bagle with the honey walnut cream cheese spread but this one had tasting notes of the everything bagel (sesame seeds, poppy seeds, garlic, toasted onion, and kosher salt). Maybe they had them in the same compartment or possibly they ran one of them through the toaster before my bagel and didn't clean it.... 

Hint Panera Bread,... garlic doesn't mix well with cinnamon"}
{"text":"The name says it all ~ and who wouldn't want Paradise for lunch? This location is conveniently located on Ray Road just east of the 101 freeway. Lots of seating indoors and out, always clean and the staff is very friendly. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal here. Fresh ingredients for salads and sandwiches and daily soups make for a tough decision on what to eat. I love the southwest ceasar chicken salad (though I make a few additions and they never have a problem doing so) and the turkey club sandwich. It's all good! The best thing are all the bakery items ~ brownies, muffins, scones and of course the cookies! Bonus ~ get a free cookie with your meal. They also offer BOGO cookie with any meal ordered. My kids have ordered the smoothies in the past and love them and they also have coffee in several different forms, hot, blended & iced. It's all good!"}
{"text":"The change from Paradise Bakery to Panera means no help and a 20 minute wait for a salad!the new system of ordering does not work well at all. Used to be great."}
{"text":"Still the worst run Paradise in the system. Only one cashier again at lunch time so 10 minutes just to pay. This manager should be fired."}
{"text":"Love the Roasted Turkey Artichoke Panini and Tomato soup!!

Employees very nice and great customer service."}
{"text":"Panera is nothing special. I ordered an egg white sandwich ( which was over $5.00) and the egg whites were not cooked! Their plain bagels are so tough you can hardly bite through them! If I want really unique and delicious deli style food I ALWAYS go to Docs Deli!!!"}
{"text":"Solid Panera, the food was good, served quickly. And the service was good.  On average, a better experience than the typical (pretty good) experience I have had at other Panera locations."}
{"text":"I ordered from Panera Bread Company today for a company luncheon.  Kelli at the Metro location is great!  She was precise and accurate on taking our orders and they delivered on time! We placed 18 separate orders from their main menu and every single order was correct.  They were highly organized and had not only the order written on the outside of the box but also the persons name.  I will definitely use them again for our company events.  

Thank you Panera!"}
{"text":"I went to this Panera location the other day while I was waiting for my car at the nearby CT. The location is awesome, the seating and space is pretty swanky but you definitely pay for it.

I had a bagel and coffee and everything was served up quickly.

I didn't spend too much time here but it was definitely a nice sit-down, comfortable restaurant to hang out in and read the paper or get some work done if you need to kill some time.

Cool selection of interesting and tempting pastries and baked goods but I didn't try any of that (eye candy, lol)"}
{"text":"I coworker of mine told me their soups are really good and I should try them. 

It took me a while but I did. I was always distance about trying this place just because I heard it was over priced for the food. Mind you some of the food is on the pricey side, but if you know how to order (yes I said How to order), than you can get the most bang for your buck.

I come here most mornings for a smoothie and their passion fruit green tea chill. It is so refreshing and tastes amazing. I defiantly would recommend for anyone to try it.

I like to switch things up and explore the menu when I can. 

So far my top picks for food would be the soups (all are very good), turkey chili, bear claw and mac n' cheese.

As I said before to get the most for your money order the PICK 2 combos. As well getting the Panera card gives you perks and discounts which never hurt. 

Till next time xoxo happy eats!"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Panera and I still do have a fondness for it, though I'm growing out of it. This is mostly because I'm evolving in my tastes and a little more into the local and independent scene now. That said, I do, every once in awhile, need a Panera salad, soup or bagel; who doesn't crave those cinnamon crunch bagels?!

This is probably the worst Panera I've stepped foot in for a few reasons. Being that the place is new, you'd expect some things to be a little off, but not really in such a corporate chain situation should you ever run into too many discrepancies. 

Problem 1: The food. I'm currently in the midst of a mushroom obsession. If there are mushrooms on or in it, I'm likely to be drawn to it. I got some crazy spinach mushroom salad right around when they opened and the salad was new on the menu. It was probably one of the most repulsive food items I've had in my life. The mushrooms were overcooked and gelled and the dressing was, for lack of a better word, gross. 

Problem 2: When I was picking up previously mentioned salad, it wasn't packaged to-go like I requested, which wasn't that big of a deal. What was a big deal in this mix up was the way the man (I'm guessing a manager) that was running food with the other employees reacted. He was yelling and causing a ruckus that not only embarrassed the employees, but revealed how inefficient everything really was. 

Problem 3: The layout of the store. The queue to order things is obstructed by a large pillar in the middle of the restaurant that blocks view of most of the menu and the cashiers. You can't really see the menu until you're called up to order, which is simply poor planning and more than a little irritating for someone who is indecisive and hates to feel pressured (but also hates to make people wait).  

This is, overall, one of the most unnecessarily difficult establishments I've ever visited and aside from the disastrous salad experience, I've only gone back once for some chicken noodle soup in a moment of desperation."}
{"text":"The first couple times I visited Panera after the switch it was just a disaster. Every order I placed had something inaccurate about it...but I gave it another go a few weeks back and gotta say...the online ordering is so d@mn good. I can order, customize, pay and all online then just go and pick it up without having to speak to a soul...and so far, it's all been 100% accurate. 

The kids at the counter still seemed real mixed up but as long as I can order online who cares. This ordering experience is a lot better then going to Paradise Bakery and trying to order food from kids standing around while I'm trying to order a meal."}
{"text":"Every year that passes they become more \"Panera-fied\" and I'm less motivated to eat at Paradise.  It's sad what a local institution has turned into after getting bought out!  The \"old\" Paradise (which always had an insane line at every mall and restaurant) was super focused on baked-right-there goods and high quality meats, pastas, and more.  I grudgingly admit the Panera-fied menu is healthier (as in lower calories and fat), but the amount of meat, cheese, and veggies in the sandwiches and salads is pathetic now.  The deli meat is now very processed and obviously lower quality, while the \"central bakery\" and pre-made dough changes have lowered the baked goods' quality.  And don't get me started on the microwaved macaroni and cheese.  I even hate the new script logo which seems nonsensical since the old \"swirly\" Paradise logo was closer to the current Panera one!  Oh, and the bags are much cheaper now too, with no handles (they were like Starbucks' bags before and super durable).  I even resent the new white dishes that replaced the signature colorful Paradise ones and the ugly chairs they're replacing the old ones with.

That said, the food is still a little step above Subway, especially the chicken with wild rice cream soup.  The recipe/taste of the cookies thankfully is still intact, as is the free cookie you get with most meals.  Years ago they competed directly with Wildflower Bread, but now they're barely a step above fast food.

Service is hit or miss.  Make sure to check your order before you leave if you're getting takeout.  They'll remake things that they mess up on.

The parking lot can be absolutely ridiculous and is woefully inadequate for such a large restaurant.  Watch out for people parked over the lines!  Sometimes it's less hectic by the Circle K.

Yes, it's still a decent place to grab an affordable not-fried lunch from on a workday, especially if you can avoid the lunch rush.

Expert tips: They do have the ability to toast bread slices.  You can ask to swap the free chocolate chip cookie for another type as they ring in your order."}
{"text":"We ordered lunch for 8 people today and spent about $100.  The person bringing our food out didn't know what sandwiches and soups she was bringing out to us.  She just kept putting food in the table and when I asked what it was, she replied \"I don't know.\"  We had to pry open the different paninis to figure out which belonged to whom.  She did the same with the 5 soups that came out.  The tortilla soup was actually COLD... not even warm!  When we told her, she said to heat it ourselves in the microwave!  I've never had such terrible experience.  I like Panera for breakfast but it'll be a while before we return!  They just opened and they are already slacking!!!"}
{"text":"As always, like Panera. This one here in Mayfield is crazy busy and scoring an afternoon coffee is a bit hard. Still good."}
{"text":"My kids love Panera and I have yet to meet someone who does not feel the same. For me, this location is so perfect with the fireplace and the fact that it's easy to grab coffee and then go right next door and grocery shop. Love it here ."}
{"text":"I like Panera. The good is always delicious and consistent. I've had pretty negative experiences the last few times that I visited the Huntersville, NC store. Apparently the company redesigned its stores (and modified ways you could order food). It seems different every time I'm in the store. Unfortunately,  the employees treat me like I'm supposed to know about these changes and what I'm supposed to do. They get frustrated when I hold up their processes. I didn't know the tables were numbered now? And you don't have to sit at the table numbered with the same number on your buzzer? Excuse me for being confused! It's to the point where I really don't enjoy going in Panera to eat. I like the food, and that's it."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've eve tried Panera and I was hoping for more. I got a panini with pulled chicken and creamy tomato soup, my husband ordered a panini also ten realized on the receipt it said something different that what he ordered. He went back to the counter and told the people the situation and they said it would be taken care of- no problem. Well the sandwich he didn't order was delivered to the table. We didn't press the issue because the sandwich looked good but still a bummer when he was expecting something different. After our meal I went up to the counter and got a cookie. I may have not been specific enough but they gave me the wrong kind. When I took it back they switched it for me with no problem. When we sat down at our table it had obviously not been cleaned for awhile. We sat at the other end. The food was ok, restaurant was not very clean feeling and the pastry section was sparse. Nothing like I was expecting. But we had a gift card and I left full."}
{"text":"Enjoyed eating dinner tonight not crowded at all for a Friday night. Loved the salad green goddess dressing surprised that they don't have Ranch dressing. Sandwich really small white bread yuck chicken avocado Blt 3 little pieces of bacon. Thank god the salad was good!"}
{"text":"The food is always good, however, the service is not. Every time I order food to go or dine in it takes forever to get your food. I used to work at Panera in college and we had a five minute rule to get food out to the customer and this location takes at least 10 minutes even when they have no one in the restaurant. The staff just doesn't seem like they care too much about getting the food out quickly. Whether it be a salad or a sandwich, it takes a very long time to receive food."}
{"text":"Rapid PickUp is pretty cool! The food is really tasty as well - and everyone smiles a lot there. Which strangely enough, means a lot. Only thing is that I thought it was an organic place. But no. Checked the ingredients and there's all sorts of stuff I can't pronounce in their food. So, can't indulge too often. I try to keep as many chemicals out of my body as possible! But - if you don't care about chemicals, than...it's loverly!"}
{"text":"Horrible 7$ grown up grilled cheese!!!!!!!!!! I felt like I got ripped off!! I wanted to complian but said oh well. Sonic has better Grilled cheese for half the price!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice place. A nice restaurant in a nice location next to some shopping. I like Panera. They are a nice chain and have some really good stuff on their menu. I will give them four star just because I reserve my fifth star for independent restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is a new shopping area on Cedar road with all of the usual favorite fast food places for people. I have been to Panera in the past and I have always liked their food. They have fresh ingredients (for the most part). Recepies are consistent throughout USA and staff is usually friendly. 

I always feel like they charge a little more for their vegetarian options than they should. But that is true for most restaurants. This particular one is very spacious. It has many good options for a date night, study night, go out with friends night or just take your kids to Panera night. 

Nothing extra-ordinary, delivers the consistency of Panera bread."}
{"text":"Line was ridiculously long so I decided to use the \"avoid the line\" kiosk. After ordering & ready to submit the final order, I was prompted with an error message that just said \"ingredients in your order are unavailable. Please edit your order.\" It didn't indicate which items were unavailable. So I got back in. Waited for maybe 15 minutes because they had only one register open during a busy time. When I finally got up to the register and ordered, the cashier said they were out of avocados. It's a little ridiculous that at 4pm, they're out of avocados already. First time going to that Panera, & will definitely be the last!"}
{"text":"One of the worst Panera Bread experiences that I have ever had,  Service was poor and the food not made correctly or appetizingly.  

Stopped here so we could eat outside because we were traveling with our dog.  They do have outdoor tables and a nice patio.  That accounts for the two stars, everything else gets zero.  I went in to order our food and a very sloppy dressed girl call me over to take my order.  I step up and she immediately turns her attention to two other employees who are having a discussion that doesn't concern her.  I couldn't get her attention back to me.  It literally was minutes before she was ready to focus on her customer.  How rude.  I ordered the turkey and avocado blt.  There was no bacon on it.  I thought that maybe I had misinterpreted what the sandwich was but I look it up online and there was supposed to be bacon.  Hubby wanted a ham and cheese which they don't actually have so she ordered a a turkey and cheese.  It did come with the requested ham substituted but she had asked if I wanted a whole or half.  I said whole  - evidently a \"whole\" turkey and cheese is actually two sandwiches.  We didn't need or want that.  Would have been nice if that had been explained to us.  Then they stuffed the sandwich with red onions.  It was basically two onion sandwiches with a bit of ham and swiss.  I don't think this is the quality or standard that Panera strives for.  I want to believe that this experience was location specific.  We won't be stopping at this location again."}
{"text":"Orded food @ 6:28pm it is now 7pm and im still waiting for a peach blueberry smoothie.. all i hear are the employee's talking and talking, ive finished my food already.. where is the smoothie(?)"}
{"text":"Really disappointed with Panera lately. It used to be my favorite place to eat, i would eat out here multiple times a week.  Now it just lacks its specialty it used to have. Ordered a steak sandwich as part one of my pick two and practically got a finger sandwich instead. Especially the amount of money you pay here, you would think you'd get your money's worth. The weird thing is, i've gotten this sandwich before and it was much bigger. I understand portion control and the message of eating healthy behind panera, but this wouldn't even fill a child up! The last 5 times i've been here i've had similar problems. Barley any meat in my sandwiches, the sandwich being way too small, or having a flatbread that is 90% barbecue sauce and 10% chicken. Missing the old panera/paradise!"}
{"text":"If you are craving Panera, find a different location. This one frequently gets the orders wrong, especially if you order \"to go\". I guess they figure you won't catch it until you are home anyway.  Don't order past 8pm because you never know what you will get (you certainly won't get fresh bread."}
{"text":"I have been to Panera several times.  The broccoli cheese soup and french onion soup are the best,.  

However, I have never had a good apple from Panera.  EVER.  They are always tasteless and thick skinned.  I am not sure where they get their apples from but it might not be bad idea to shop around and have someone with taste buds pick the apples.

The Sierra turkey is a really good Cafe sandwich but the onions on it are a bit hot and strong.  I picked them off. The Chipolte mayo was a little spicy but added great flavor to the sandwich. It comes on Asiago cheese focaccia which I probably would have picked a different bread. I have tried other sandwiches and I have liked most of them.

I tried one of the new pasta dishes the other day and was not overly impressed.  But I am not a pasta person.

I went through the drive through for the first time today and I was really impressed with how quickly I got in and out of it.  It seems you wait longer for you food when you dine in."}
{"text":"I still like Panera. I love the french onion soup! But they have recently added a tip option to their debit/credit card reader.  Now, in front of the person taking your order it asks if you would like to tip your server.  What server????  It really made me feel awkward.  I am already spending $23 and I have to wait at the counter, carry my own food to the table and clean up after myself.  What is the tip for?"}
{"text":"This chain Is classically great, really do love this location though!! I work right next door and love going here for coffee before work as well as lunch on occasion. I love the steak salad with Gorgonzola as well as the Asiago bagel with honey walnut spread. Any of the soups here are great- especially the broccoli and cheese and the tomato basil."}
{"text":"This Panera location is right next to work. I love the service I get here that is always spot on. Iced coffee is excellent and salads are great!! Even though this location is continuously busy,I've never waited very long at all (5min)  for service. To go orders are always correct which is a nice plus!!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here, I love their soups, sandwiches and pastry, especially the Cheese Danish. 

The only complaint I have is their price and pasta dishes. The pastas are definitely overpriced and the portion is a extremly small. 

The pasta tasted ok, just wish the portion can a bit more. For $7 dollar, I expect to be at least half full and not starving."}
{"text":"Every single time we go, no matter what time of day, they are out of more item. And that's just the beginning. The food is almost always subpar. I go to the location in Parma that is ALWAYS good. So it's not like I'm choosing food I don't like. It's so close to home so it's convenient but seriously. Get it together. I know Panera can do well, I love their food. This location is just garbage."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that doesn't do anything or has given up on managing the homeless population that congregates in the parking lot and will bother you even while you are trying to order. Not one manager or worker stepped in. You will  be bothered while eating by the same folks that watch outside the windows. They will come in to greet you. My wife had soup that was cold. She kindly asked if it could be reheated. It came back just as cold. My wife is a liberal social worker and even she complained about the homeless overrunning that location. We are very sorry we went. Never again."}
{"text":"Another great location. The service was friendly and fast. The place was also clean and well kept. This location has one of the better patio/outdoor seating areas I've encountered. Another plus is it's location at Boca Park, which in my opinion is one of the nicest areas in the city. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This huge bakery/café is hard to miss, and hard to beat. Whether you're looking for your morning coffee or a hearty lunch they have plenty of tasty options and lots of seating. The coffee is affordable, and fresh. Cappuccino had that sumptuous texture it lacks at Starbucks and Tim Hortons.

Staff were all very friendly and fast. We went back twice in one day. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Dear panera it won't kill you to serve better portions. Giving this place a one star because apparently 1/2 a sandwich is less than 1/2 of what an ACTUAL sandwich is suppose to be. Not to mention my broccoli cheddar soup was COLD. Super disappointed with this place, girl at the register was kind of rude I feel like she over charged me for my meal! won't be coming back here again!!!"}
{"text":"This Panera is so close to our home, and we usually have such good experiences at other Panera restaurants, that we keep giving this location a \"second chance.\" Over and over and over, even though we know better by now. The order is going to be wrong so you have to check it; it's not going to be ready when they said it would be ready, so leave extra time before you go to pick it up, etc. etc. But now the quality of the food is reaching downright disgusting levels. This makes me really sad, because I think Panera Bread Co. as a business is trying to do all of the right things in terms of clean food and quality ingredients. Unfortunately, this location has employees who couldn't care less. Just for laughs, compare the picture of my son's \"Italian sandwich\" from tonight with the picture of that item on the web menu. And not only that -- the arugula was browning, limp and mushy. One piece of provolone only, and the shredded piece of ham looks like something they tossed into the trash at a deli counter. There was a tiny eighth of an inch of food slapped on, filling up only the center third of a large piece of bread. Maybe the bagels and coffee are still ok, but Sorry, Panera Bread Co., this location has FINALLY done enough to lose this very patient and tolerant customer's business."}
{"text":"Cookies baked fresh daily! Panera has all kinds of baked goods from pastry, muffins, brownies, rolls and bread. I have tried a few of their menu items like their sandwiches and soup bread bowls, and they taste good. But I find myself getting lured to buying freshly baked cookies. The Kitchen Sink Cookies are my all-time favorite. It's a very large cookie that has toffee, chocolate chip, caramel, tiny bits of pretzel, and it's sprinkled with rock salt. When you bite into the cookie, it has a nice crunchy edge yet it taste soft in the middle. On my next visit, it's going to be an orange scone. I was told the orange scone is not too sweet, and that the top of the scone is just lightly brushed with a simple orange glaze."}
{"text":"I thought I knew what to expect when walking into this Fairlawn Panera. moderately priced cafe food and espresso drinks, along with a panel of yummy looking pastries I can't eat. I never expected to have my computer stolen and a hot dad named Scott to come to my rescue. 

I did what I always do when I walk into a Panera; I scope out the lamps. I've found that the only outlets in Panera are usually located near a floor lamp. I found one near a corner and planted myself for some internet surfing and yelp browsing. After getting to the bottom of my Dr. Pepper, I needed to use the restroom. Normally, I pack up my belongings and bring them in with me. But, today I'd been particularly friendly with the table of churchgoing ladies next to me. I decided to leave my computer and just make a run to the restroom. When I came out, I saw the group of women clustered around the windows, all busy talking. Next thing I know, this tall, athletically built 40ish looking guy in a blue polo and khaki shorts comes rushing into the dining area. He heads towards us and hands me my computer! Apparently, a hoodlum lifted my Toshiba laptop and took a run for it. The ladies at the adjacent table made a fuss and this guy, waiting in line for an iced cappuccino went off after him. He said all he had to do is grab him by his shirt and pull it from his hands! I offered to buy him his coffee. I used my Panera card to get the points for the purchase, of course. Too bad Scott was married. I made sure to check his ring finger.

The fun parts of this review may or may not be a figment of my imagination as I type this in Panera."}
{"text":"Yep. Panera bread. Be warned: if you are going there for the free wi-fi, there are not a ton of outlets to plug in the laptop when the battery gets low. The seating areas with little arm chairs seem to be the only places with outlets. 

They get an extra star for the free wi-fi. They get 3 stars just because they serve Dr. Pepper."}
{"text":"Breakfast Sandwiches, phenomenally done as usual Panera!!! Kudos.  Attention to detail, off the charts...My morning just went from blah to Bazinga!!!"}
{"text":"The quality of good here is fantastic, but today their customer service definitely shined more. I came in with my kids to grab some lunch to go. When I got home, there was a side of mac n cheese missing from our bag. I called the store to let them know. I cannot remember the name of the man I spoke to, but he was so polite! He said he noticed the extra one they had and asked for my address. He delivered it to me! With a couple of extra bakery items! I'm so incredibly impressed with them today. Also, their mac n cheese is made from the cheese gods."}
{"text":"Been here many times, this is the closest one to work so my co-workers and I tend to come to this location when we want a filling, healthy meal.

I've tried various combos between their pastas, soup, salad & sandwiches. My favorite is as simple as it gets: Grilled Cheese Sandwich, Tomato Soup, Green Tea & Chocolate Pastry. You have a choice if you'd like chips or a side of bread with your combo too. 

The price isn't the best and meals are hit-or-miss but it hasn't stopped me from coming here. Soup is always piping hot, sandwich is toasted, drink is delicious. When I've slurped my Green Tea to the last drop, I refill with their Acai Berry Tea, which is equally delicious as well. 

I'm definitely a fan. :)"}
{"text":"So trashy - spent $26 on breakfast with the family and was told to microwave my $3 croissant and $3 cinnamon roll. Microwave. Panera touts themselves as a bakery and tells me to microwave my food like some gas station. Not only that, but I got to crawl on my hands and knees to get to said microwave stuffed under the counter. Lovely. Wish I could give half a star!

Oh, and their coffee was cold."}
{"text":"This place changed from paradise bakery to a Panera bread company. I didn't frequent Paradise often, but had been enough times to know it was solid in the things I ordered. My wife and I both felt incredibly underwhelmed with the food we got for lunch. The Mediterranean vegetable sandwich consisted of tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers with a couple of crumbles of feta. The tomato soup is not close to what paradise had and isn't a worthy substitute. The garden vegetable soup was not tasty and neither was the Fontega chicken panini. 

Skip this place. Not worth the trip."}
{"text":"Seriously Panera!!!!!! I waited half hour in your drive-thru line for a cup of soup, not even hot for $5.00. Chicken noodle that never saw a piece of chicken. Did you count the noodles and carrots???? Only saw three carrots. I had three bites of bread and that is my last three bites ever with Panera. Progresso soup is cheaper and I could buy a whole loaf of banquette for $1.00!!!!!"}
{"text":"While I always enjoy a Panera bagel, bear claw, and the French onion and cream of tomato soups, Panera is pushing it with their new pasta options. $8.49 for a cup of pasta, even if it does come with a cup of soup or half salad and a piece of baguette, is not a competitive price. We tried the Rustic Penne with Bolognese sauce. It was bland and uninspiring. I will stick to Panera bagels and baked goods."}
{"text":"Just putting a disclaimer out there that I don't work for Panera since this is the third Panera I've reviewed in the past two wks. What can I say, when I like something, I really like something. I headed over to this Panera today for a change of scenery and had a nice experience. They have more seating that one would expect when looking at this place plus a lot of natural light coming in. I ordered and within one minute my order was ready and their broccoli and cheddar soup was fantastic as always. 

If you have a My Panera rewards card (which you should totally get if you dont have it already since it's free), they scan it when you pay and if you have any rewards waiting for you, they will let you know and you can redeem it then or later. Who knew I had a free drink coming to me today?? My only complaint with my experience today-- The seating gods weren't too nice to me. I had a couple next to me with one lady who was talking loudly on her cell the entire meal-hello, rude, it's nice to meet you and the other ladies next to me were talking about their friend who supposedly has ugly children. Ok, I laughed, I admit it. You can hear everything in this place!!"}
{"text":"What's a non church going girl to do at 7am on a Sunday morning in Charlotte when there is absolutely nothing going on? Go to Panera of course! So I've been eying this Panera for some time but imagined it to be a miserable spot because of the location, parking cluster it appears to have, clientele plus they offer Pepsi instead of Coke? Ew.

But I went this morning and it was absolutely peaceful. I was one of the only people there-no churchies, no junior league bookclub, no misbehaved children yet-just quiet and peaceful with classical music in the background and free Wi Fi at my fingertips. I love to start my morning off with their Breakfast Power sandwich which is only 330 calories and around $4. Plus, thanks to My Panera program, coffee was on the house. You can't go wrong there. Friendly and efficient staff and tasty, reliable food as always. I can imagine this location being a headache during the week day lunch rush or afternoon crowd during the weekends but I was pleasantly surprised with the desolate setting it offered this morning as opposed to other Panera's I've been to. I will be hitting this up again fo sho."}
{"text":"I can't believe this is my second Panera of the day....but then again I've seen crazier things happen. I came here after stopping by a Dunkin Donuts with no Wi Fi and figured why not Panera.....again. They have an awesome Pick Two Lunch Special with a side item for $6.49 and they list the calorie content clearly for you to see and make a smart decision. I always say I'm going to try a different kind of soup but their broccoli-cheddar keeps me coming back for more!

The place was bumping, even before noon on a Friday! It was difficult to find a table but I found a small booth nestles in the back for some privacy and just enough room to get some work done and enjoy my grub. All kinds of people--young, old, professional, students, loud, quiet, stinky, nice smelling. Variety is the spice of life! Parking can be a beezy here---remember to bring your My Panera rewards card (I feel like I'm totally pimping out that program today!!)"}
{"text":"Sharon truly went above and beyond to ensure our dining-in experience was a great one!!! Mahalo Sharon!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a sandwich and soup from panera today. Started eating one half when I saw a HUGE moth inside the sandwhich. So gross and unsanitary!!  Added a photo so you can see its not just a tiny bug, it's huge."}
{"text":"I love Panera Bread! My favorite thing to get there is their Pick 2 with the BBQ chicken flat bread and their Greek Goddess salad. For a breakfast item, I love their Mediterranean Egg White sandwich. 

Every time we go through the drive thru they seem to keep forgetting some of our items.... the first time, I didn't check the bags and when I got home, I was missing my salad for the Pick 2. I contacted them saying that I didn't receive my salad and when I went back to get it, they gave me a full salad. I very much appreciated that.

This time, we ordered two Pick 2's and GOOD THING we checked our bag to make sure we got everything.. we were missing TWO of our salads. When we told the lady at the window, she was not even apologetic about it. How do you miss half of our order?! The receipt even showed that our items were crossed off. She failed to hand us our complete meal... 

All in all, I'll still be coming back here because it's only two minutes away from my house. I'm just very disappointed that this keeps happening here."}
{"text":"I ordered half of a chicken walnut sandwich and it was so small.  Totally not worth $6
See pics."}
{"text":"UPDATE: the female manager (Kim?) apologized to me when I went back to this location recently. I guess I have to respect the balls she has to apologize to me. 
I go to Panera every morning to buy their iced tea and a muffin or bagel or sandwich.  I sometimes go back for lunch.  I generally don't go to this location. 
I usually take a cup in with me (from the day before) and purchase a cup and (and muffin) then fill both cups and take my order to go.  This morning, the female manager (Kim?) yelled at me and said I'm not allowed to take a refill with me. She said she knows who I am and has seen me do this before and she will not allow me to do it. She said that \"they\" knows about what I'm doing and has told her about me and that's why she is confronting me about this situation. I was so shocked.  Literally speechless, I told her I've never had anyone say this to me and I go to Panera every day. Sometimes even twice a day. She told me I am not allowed to come back to this location anymore.  
I guess I will just take my business elsewhere.  Clearly this chick has some sort of power trip issues.  And why does she care if I take my refill with me? I just paid $2.60 for a plastic cup.  I think I'm entitled to take my refill with me. 
I guess this psychotic manager thinks I'm stealing ice tea that probably costs about 12 cents.  And they usually throw most of the ice tea away after two hours anyway.  
This chick is so psycho. She doesn't own Panera. Why does she give a crap if I take a refill? It's just so bizarre.  
I literally can't make this stuff up.... so weird.
Ps.  This is a picture of how many cups
I have purchased and saved just this week!"}
{"text":"PB is one of my favorite lunch stops!
it's near my work, yummy veg options, veggie minestrone soup, bagels, pasta, salads, grilled cheeses. I recommend getting a Panera rewards card so you rack up those points and use it for free drinks or pastries. 

Also- call ahead to place your lunch order and have it ready usually within 10 minutes. Walk in and leave in no time. No wait!

My big pet peeve here. Some may laugh, but this is a big visual peeve that we maintain and keep looking fresh throughout the day at my company. 

Please, please take that extra minute and have someone clean your entrance/exit doors. If I walk up to a visual multitude of sweaty palm prints, smeared fingers, and god knows what else.... am I really going to feel a sense of cleanliness towards my food prep? This is huge. Appearances are JUST as important as the food being prepared. I know I am not alone in being a regular lunch mate to this location."}
{"text":"Food is still great but they ALWAYS mess up my to go orders now. They are rude about it too. I don't know what happened with their standard with who they hire in but everyone who works here is rude and crabby now. I'll drive a little further out to the other one to avoid the incompetent rude staff. I've had terrible service the last three times."}
{"text":"Amazing staff, very clean, fresh food, this is a model Panera Bread! I come every single morning at 6:30 or 7am and they are always courteous and prepared with fresh food and they serve it quickly! There has never once been a fly seen in the restaurant so I would not listen to Angela M. I come here every single day, I would have noticed!"}
{"text":"Ordered the half steak sandwich, it was about the size of a deck of cards. Also got a bad upset stomach.  Not the Panera Bread we once Knew.  Wont be back"}
{"text":"This ia a great Panera location! They have a drive thru and a really nice open patio. I only don't give them 5 stars because every time I'm there the staff seems to be always rushing. Two times they forgot to include my side French baguette and one of those times I had to ask two different staff since the first one was rushing in and out the patio and totally forgot about my bread. The place is really nice, but they should get more staff and prepare those already working there, because doesn't matter if you have an amazing place, if your people are not prepared you only lose."}
{"text":"Unfriendly and unhelpful employees at this location very odd, not like other Panera locations."}
{"text":"When the food is good, it's great.  Problem is, it's hardly ever good.  My soup is always cold and they could never manage to actually MELT the cheese in my grilled cheese sandwich.  All of this for usually around $9 or $10.  

On the upside, the staff is friendly and always smiling.  Not sure how much that means when the food and prices stink, but it's better than rude workers!

We've seemed to have better luck at Panera with breakfast, so I'd say that's worth a shot.  But if you're in the mood for soup/salad/sandwiches, I'd try someplace else."}
{"text":"The service sucks here. For the prices they charge everything should be spot on. They messed up our order. Brought out the wrong food. When they did bring out our food it was cold and had to send it back.  No offers to rectify the mistakes. 

I would have least they would have discounted or comped something.

A few other customers had the same problems we did as well while we were there. The orders were incorrect and/or their food was cold and had to be warmed up."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed.  I had heard so many nice things.  My friend suggested the turkey sandwich on three cheese bread.  It was horrible...soggy bread, barely any meat, a half piece of bacon and one slice of yellow cheese.  After each eating a half of our sandwiches we told the manager, that we were really disappointed...he graciously offered to remake.  He brought us each a 1/2 of a sandwich (Really??? cheap ass!!!).  But it was no better.  and he never came back to see if we liked.  So we left them.

It was also almost $30 for two sandwiches and two large drinks.  Again, Really????

I hear the bread is great.  Will have to stick to that if I return."}
{"text":"What a great place...The service was excellent.  Their Manager Fred was soooo nice.  I have never been to that Paradise Bakery but I will stop there...every chance I get!!!"}
{"text":"I eat lunch here a couple times per month. The staff is very friendly and the food comes out quickly.  I think Panera is a little overpriced in general but it doesn't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"They were slammed and we got our food in a timely manner. New chicken tortilla soup is diverse and flavorful with shredded chicken, strips of bell peppers I think, lime, also bought the caramel apple thumbprint pastry for breakfast tomorrow! Super excited, staff was friendly. It is MLK day, so probably the reason why it was SO busy."}
{"text":"Murray pretty much summed it all up in his review. Not only does the exterior fit in wonderfully with the streetscape, but the interior is really pleasant and interesting. There are several little nooks and crannies to discover and sit to either eat and run or stay and work at your computer (as I am doing now). I love how many windows there are to people watch! Nice job Panera and Lakewood!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Panera Bread by my friend in 2012. At first I only came here for their hazelnut coffee (Refillable) but the more I went I would add another item with my coffee. 
As a student this is my go to place to study and have good food at the same time. The staff is great! Always friendly and accommodating. 

The one thing that I can never refuse to is their mac n' cheese. I can have it everyday, that would be fine! It's on the creamier side but that's what makes it so good. It costs about $8, more or less, and comes with a choice of an apple, or baguette, or chips (Home made and very crunchy). Their prices are moderate to expensive depending what you get. 

Another feature I really like is the Panera rewards card, being a member you collect points with every order and from time to time you get something from 'My Surprises' and it can be a discount, a free beverage or pastry. 

If you're out with a group of friends, co-workers, and/or colleagues I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was surprised to walk in to kiosks to order your food. A cashier offered to help me because I'm sure she could see my confusion. I ordered a half salad and small drink... $9.63!! When I swiped my credit card, it asked me if I wanted to leave a tip. For what?? Taking my order? I certainly didn't know yet what kind of food or service I would be getting. I've never been asked to tip upfront before.

As I filled my soda, I realized the place was nearly empty but filthy dirty. In high school, I learned \"if you got time to lean, you got time to clean\". No manager should've accepted that. But then I found the managers who were there were too busy restocking or sampling everything and didn't want to be bothered. Also, my soda tasted like dirt. 

I got home to eat and my salad was awful. I got the SW Chicken Caesar but 70% of it was the thick white ends from the iceberg lettuce. This salad was no where near green. The dressing came on the side and when I went to pour it on, it had been completely watered down. It was runny. Runny Caesar dressing.  *gag*  I will give credit for the baguette. It was edible.

At least I didn't leave a tip."}
{"text":"I would like to give them a negative review but 1 is as low as I can give them.  When a customer places an online Rapid order for IMMEDIATE pickup, I shouldn't have to come in, SIT DOWN AND THEN ASK FOR MY ORDER.  No apology or anything.  I guess I will be taking my business to Starbuck's and Dunkin Donuts.  Thanks for lack of customer service and courtesy."}
{"text":"Dear Sarah G,

Thank you for the suggesting we go to Paradise cafe. I tried the cookies and they were A-OK. Perhaps it is time to return for a 6th try?

Sincerely,

Jenn H

Now back to my regularly scheduled review of Paradise Bakery:

First of all... WHY THE CRAP WAS IT SO COLD IN THERE? Even my poor little Yelp hoodie couldn't keep me warm. I ordered soup - SOUP in July! - to keep me warm and that did not work. Perhaps that is because the soup was made out of a melted salt lick. 

But that's another issue.
 
Oh...

My salad was dope 

They have Fresca in the soda fountain (Yes!)

They gave me a free cookie

3 different types of iced tea 

The bathroom was very clean 

Free internet rocks 

But if you intend to eat here bring a snow suit. 

Or possibly a snow suit, pile of blankets, ear muffs and a space heater.

Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. Still shivering."}
{"text":"In a quest to find free Wi Fi this morning, I stumbled upon Panera on Providence and couldn't have been happier. I stopped by a few Starbucks locations but it was full of hipsters and other bank or govt employees that had the day off so that was a no go. But then I remembered Panera and how I never visited this location before so decided to give it a shot. It's like any other standard Panera, piping hot coffee and pastries galore but it wasn't too crowded and I found a cushioned seat to nestle myself in. It's been forever since I have been to a Panera and I found out about their My Panera rewards program, which may be newer-like any program, the more you spend, the more goodies you get in return. Friendly staff, lots of seating, free Wi Fi and no screaming babies (yet). I dig."}
{"text":"We went in for a quick lunch & we got combos. There was literally one piece of thick sliced chicken in the center of my sandwich. Not exaggerating one slice on half a sandwich. My husband had a 1/2 panini & had the same one slice of meat issues. 
They were busy but not crowded at prime time lunch time. Apparently a lot of people already got the memo. 

The 2 stars is for the bread which was a fresh giant thick slice. Lots of flavor. Very good bread. Also the tomato soup was good & the pumpkin shaped sugar cookie was good. But we won't be back with another 4 sandwich shops in the shopping areas surrounding this Panera.
Let's put it this way. Subway is a better option & is the least fave of mine as far as sandwich options. Well until now unfortunately."}
{"text":"Love this location great food Awesome staff out standing management all around. If you haven't tried this location you should."}
{"text":"I have yet to order food here for dine-in or rapid pickup that wasn't 100% accurate. They either forget a salad dressing, leave tomatoes on a sandwich. And employees are very slow.  Such a drag.  An area manager needs to grab a hold of this place and shake it up with some employees who have attention to detail and who care about their jobs."}
{"text":"This Panera was just remodeled since it was previously a paradise bakery. I go to Panera every day but have not been to this one in awhile. I was so happy to see that this location looks very nice and clean and they even have a new and improved \"tea bar.\" (See photo)
I come to Panera every morning because of their wonderful tea, since I no longer drink coffee. The Panera by my house does not have this new tea system.  I love this tea bar because the tea dispenser is clear so you can see if there is tea in the dispenser or if they are out of a certain flavor. Also, this tea dispenser keeps the tea cool opposed to hot. Very nice upgrade!"}
{"text":"I have been to every Panera in maricopa county and this is my favorite one because they are one of the only locations that knows how to make regular unsweetened ice tea the way I like it. There is a location much closer to my house but I drive the extra distance to go to this location."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Panera Bread, but this place is not so good. In the beginning, I come here every single morning. Employees were kind, the coffee were fresh and steaming hot, it was like heaven. After a couple of months that started to fade away. The employees were grumpy and rude, the service was horrible, and the coffee were cold and nasty. It was just bad. I stopped going there and started going to the on Fort Apache. Go there instead, the employees are extremely nice and helpful and the pastries and coffee were fresh. So, if you want delicious pastries, bread, food, coffee ... Go to the one on Fort Apache."}
{"text":"Food is good but I guess because they are a newer location they need some time to figure out how to actually make a sandwich properly.. Would recommend but when you get your food be prepared to rearrange on the bun ;) Yes it is petty but its the little things in life that can drive you mad."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened but this used to be one of my favorite places... Loved the pick 2! They have changed how to select/order and now it has become confusing and I end up spending way more. The food is just not as original or tasty too. Sorry !"}
{"text":"I was so glad to see a Panera Bread pop up in Fort Mill.  I'm not fond of the layout of  this one, seems cramped and feel like they could have done a better job with the space.

Nothing against this Panera, but I went back recently and am starting to really dislike Panera.  Prices have gone up and portion sizes/quality have gone down.  Besides, they have removed a number of my favorite sandwiches from the menu.  

Overall, just not impressed with Panera like I used to be, and it will not be an option for me moving forward unless someone else suggests it and wants to go there."}
{"text":"This location has okay food but they're always messing up my order. I pay for a large and get a small I get a cup full of ice full to the top and barely and tea. Then I spend $45 and they don't even scan my rewards card! It's always one thing after another they have very lazy staff.. and for pretty expensive food it's getting ridiculous I'll probably stop going here cause I'm just over paying and never getting the right orders or sizes."}
{"text":"I ordered here it was not that full they took our order very fast and after finding a table the food came after 5min. 
The GM brought the soup a very friendly guy and he asked us for butter for the baguette and brought it very fast to the table.
Soup was nice so the onion soup is amazing I always order it but this time I went for the creamy tomato soup which was a little too sweet and a little cold 
The location was clean 
I would recommend it for a healthy breakfast or lunch with friends or family on weekends."}
{"text":"Best service I've EVER had! I will definitely come back when on this side of town!  The employees are very professional and the food was perfect."}
{"text":"This is a good place to enjoy a quick breakfast on weekends. I usually order most of their bagels to workplace . However on my recent visit, I tried avocado chicken sandwich with broccoli cheddar soup which turned out to be the best combination.

Also the staff here are very friendly and prompt at service . Along with it the place is always kept clean and nice atmosphere .They have a bunch of ipads to fast order and they are constantly good at taste ."}
{"text":"- the place was FILTHY and it wasn't due to being understaffed by far! 

even though there were adequate empty tables available, none were even close to clean while the local teens in Panera uniform texted and goofed off. 

wth is wrong with people......"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Friday afternoon and started wondering why I don't come in more often after the lunch rush. The guy at the counter was very friendly, and the restaurant was clean and cool, perfect for taking a break from the heat and relaxing for a bit. I ordered the spicy Thai chicken salad and added avocado to it, and a drink which ended up being the green tea/ mango infused drink, so refreshing. My food came quickly and was so good. It was a large portion so I had to take some to go, but who can complain about that?? Their menu has a lot of different options for soups, sandwiches and salads. I wouldn't recommend coming in during the lunch rush or on weekends, I doubt the experience will be as relaxing as this one was!"}
{"text":"Food was not made correctly for take out order.  I ordered a bagel sandwich with an over medium egg. I got brioche instead of a bagel and an over cooked, disgusting egg. My husband's mocha tasted like a hot chocolate and my latte tasted like a mocha. Definitely not worth $20."}
{"text":"I came in to order a cob salad to go. I explicitly said no cheese three times because I can't have dairy. I get home and there's bleu cheese all over my salad, which I now have to throw out. The traffic is too ridiculous tonight for me to turn around and get a new salad. Frustrating!"}
{"text":"I have been to this Panera a few times before but ended up there twice in the last couple of weeks. Overall the food is the same quality you would expect from other franchise locations but the service was inconsistent. There is also a small parking lot. 

The first experience I had was terrible when it came to ordering. The cashier seemed untrained and there was only one other person in line but the employee seemed frustrated as though there were a major crowd. My order came out wrong and luckily the food prep staff quickly remade my food. 

The second time my cashier was able to correctly and quickly take my order. And my food came out as expected. I'm a fan of the you pick two and the seasonal strawberry poppyseed salad is great this time of year. 

The cleanliness of the tables both times wasn't the best despite a no more than half full restaurant. The location might need to spend a little more time cleaning off tables during peak hours. Overall I'll be back out of the convenience of this location only."}
{"text":"Panera Bread - ugh I always forget this is my go to bagel place, not so much my sandwich and soup stop, but I do land here from time to time but I usually leave with the same disappointment every single time. It's not so much the food as it is their failure to execute the entire experience. This restaurant is beautiful, spacious and the staff is super friendly, but the food was poorly prepared and incorrect, reeking a lack of training and poor management.

Wild Rice Cream of Chicken Soup - served cold, very pasty

Hot Ham and Cheese on a Toasted Everything Bagel - served cold deli style with lettuce, tomato and mayo on a cold tough bagel

Very disappointing - I do like the grab a pager and we'll bring the food to your table..."}
{"text":"Finally visited a Panera Bread and this was the best location. Food was delicious and great customer service."}
{"text":"Panera is Panera, so it's delicious regardless of the experience but I have to write a review based solely on the customer service. The staff here constantly seems confused and not sure what's actually going on. The main thing that turned me off to this panera exclusively is one of the ladies who work here. I believe she may be a manager or some sort of supervisor, I unfortunately did not catch her name but she left me with a terrible impression. She wears her hair pulled back tight and a striped shirt. Extremely rude and NOT friendly. She seems pretty irritated that you're even there in there first place. I couldn't even get a smile out of this woman when I got to the register to order. Fire her, train her, give her prozac something to make her a LITTLE more happy."}
{"text":"Ordered a family sized chicken noodle soup with three Frontega paninis. While walking out, I checked the bag to make sure the order was right. I noticed the chips were missing. Not a problem, it happens. Walked back and was given back the chips with an apology. 

By the time I get home I noticed the bag was wet and dripping. The soup cap wasn't secured all the way and soup spilled all over the carpet in my car. And to top it all off, of course I was given the wrong soup. Wish I would of checked more thoroughly the first time to see if my order was right. I didn't check the soup because it was in the bottom of the bag under the sandwiches. I just assumed it was right. 

So furiously, I drive all the way back and ask for the manager. I give him my receipt to prove my order was wrong and asked to replace the soup and be compensated. He had a dirty look on his face and didn't even sincerely apologize about the whole situation.

He was acting as if I'm one of those free loaders who complains all the time and tries to score free food. I'm not that kind of person, it takes A LOT for me to get upset and complain to a manager.  I was given my money back with a new soup, but honestly I could care less about the money. I just want to pay for excellent customer service and good food and that be the end of it. 

All in all, terrible customer service today. Not sure if I'll never come back because my previous visits were smooth. I guess it's just a hit or miss coming to this location."}
{"text":"I won't get into how Panera sandwiches used to be great and are now pre-made in a factory somewhere, my issue with this location is the apparent lack of a bathroom. Seriously, I walked all around the restaurant and saw only doors to the kitchen. If they have a public restroom, it certainly isn't apparent or indicated with signs. Was it outside, around back like a Texaco station?"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. I spent almost 30.00 for nothing
2 bread bowls and a bowl of soup with three drinks
My soup was so soaked through it was mushy onion bread 
I usually don't put businesses on blast but I felt the value wasn't there"}
{"text":"I generally get decent service here. My most recent trip to this location was a Saturday morning about 9 am. When I arrived the person a few people ahead of me for the last bagel in the whole place. They weren't just out of what I was hoping for, but every variety of bagel. So I opted for a sandwich. When I ordered I was informed that they did not have the type of bread it was served on, but they could make it on what they did have. Overall I was very disappointed for being a Saturday morning and being out of neatly everything."}
{"text":"The food is always good though I don't like that they do not offer gluten free options.  

Ordered: strawberry parfait without the granola, egg& bacon sandwich, pecan roll & orange scone. 

All was good though they bagged half or food to go even though we were staying.  They also have me a fork for my parfait instead of a spoon. Weird experience but not a deal breaker."}
{"text":"I once got into an argument with someone because I didn't believe there was a Panera in Westalke. I was wrong because I'm sitting in it right now! This Panera is the definition of \"tucked away in a strip mall.\" Located on Detroit Road between small office parks and residential areas are a few plazas with random (literally random) stores, boutiques, and a Panera. This one is on the smaller size and there's no community room. There is a small patio. The staff is always very friendly. Once, I ordered the wrong soup. I asked for a to-go container, off handedly mentioning that I had ordered a soup I could not eat and I'd bring it home for someone else to eat. I didn't expect for Panera to offer to provide me the soup I wanted, since it was my mistake. They told me to go ahead and tell them what soup I actually wanted and they gave it to me for free. 

I use one of those frequent customer cards and I have a free pastry and bagel coming my way. Anyone want to be my date to Panera?"}
{"text":"this shit sucks the big one, fake italian bread
small hospital quality pasta, wannabe fucking sandwiches, one little tomatoe, one little salad pepper, two small slices of meatball jerky, posing as steak on a sandwich. you should be grand jury indicted for your B.S. wannabe food
shame on this independent shitty owner."}
{"text":"I miss the paradise bakery that used to be at this location. Food hasn't been the same since. Panera bread is good for soup and salads and that's it."}
{"text":"Literally the most frustrating dining experience I've had in years. Not sure if the entire kitchen staff called in sick, or what was going on, but we waited an hour and 15 minutes for 1 sandwich and 1 chicken tortilla bowl. After seeing people who had ordered 10/15 minutes after us getting their food, I asked how much longer they thought it would be. Somehow our order had been lost, and we eventually got our food. However, the situation for everyone could have been made so much less frustrating if someone had just told us when we ordered that they were running long ticket times. The food runner girl with green hair was very nice and apologetic, but we could overhear the manager (I think his name was Mike), and he was unsympathetic and pretty rude to multiple people. A simple announcement anytime during our wait saying \"Sorry everyone! We're super behind and we will get your food out ASAP. Thank you so much for your patience,\" would have gone a long way. I hold a grudge, and therefore will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"I've been to multiple different Panera locations, and this one is the best! The employees are always so friendly, the food is delicious, and I love that they use real ingredients. I've also gotten delivery as well, and the drivers have always been timely and incredibly friendly."}
{"text":"Anti teachers and cops. Average food and grossly over priced. I go to Einsteins."}
{"text":"Honestly this is the filthiest Panera around. Bathroom usually smells and pop dispenser is 50/50. Today, coffee was out, napkins out and small drink lids out. I have yet to come in and find a clean table. Food is pretty good but cleanliness is pretty iffy. Ive taken to just ordering a drink when I come here for meetings anymore. Location is a plus for me but other than that....."}
{"text":"This location decided to close early without notice but not let corporate know so I wasted my time tonight doing an online order. Beware - do not do mobile orders without calling ahead to be sure they are open. Waste of my time and money. I will not be returning to this location or Panera due to this lack of customer service."}
{"text":"When Melissa B told me there was a new Panera, I didn't believe her b/c I was soooooo happy we finally got one Uptown! 

Visually pleasing and definitely not as crowded as other Panera's, the two things that stuck out to me were the layout and clientele. The lay out is different with smaller tables and outdoor seating as well. The clientele--all business folk. I think this is the first Panera I've seen without Stepford wives and misbehaved children!! And that along will keep me coming back in the future!  

You can come in through the College Street entrance (beware if you sit near the door-it gets damn chilly) or through the building entrance and when I went this morning, the line moved pretty quickly. I love Panera b/c of the My Panera Rewards club and you can get stuff like free drinks, espressos, pastries and more with it so that is my main reason for visiting Panera plus the free Wi-Fi.

Staff was super friendly.....like Chick Fil A \"My pleasure\" too friendly....I wondered if I was being punk'd or something b/c I'm not used to people being this nice and it seemed genuine so clicks for that.

My only complaint about this place is the acoustics. No matter where I sat, I could hear folks in the kitchen or conversations that weren't near me. I think someone who works at Panera or their wife just had a baby so that's good to know. Also, the music seemed louder than other Panera's so it was hard to concentrate on my work that needed to get done. I had to move three times just so I could get a spot where I could hear myself think.

Since this is Uptown, it doesn't seem like a Panera that people will just sit and loaf around at but I am curious to check it out on a weekend since I'm almost positive it will be more chill than other locations.

Thanks Panera for finally making it uptown!"}
{"text":"Check your silverware! Three out of four spoons and one knife were dirtY....kinda grossed me out and unsure of the cleanliness of the kitchen. I do love the food here turkey,  bacon & avocado is my favorite sandwich and the mac & cheese is delisH! 
This location Is close to where I live but I work near The District so I will probably go to that one now that I've had the dirty silverware experience"}
{"text":"Painfullyyyyy sloooowwww. Very hard to describe, but with no wait, took 30 minutes for an omelet because they lost our ticket twice. Incompetent. I really love the Paradise chain... it just seems the manager here hasn't a clue about a customers time..."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Panera Bread stores and this store has the worst customer service. It started with dropping my change in the drive-through with no apology not getting orders right not extending their arms out to hand you the food correctly. When you pull up they give you a blank stare I had to ask for the total also having to hear on of the employees using foul language about another employee while I was at the window. Never again will I bring business to this store."}
{"text":"This site used to be Paradise Bakery but was recently reconstituted as Panera Bread.  The change is NOT for the betterment of the consumer. The prices are higher. The sandwiches are smaller and thinner. Gone is the free cookie (now it's $1.60 extra for ONE small cookie!) and there are no meal options (e.g,. include drink). A small drink is $2.67 (!). They sell one flavor of chips (regular), which is smaller by at least one-third from what P.Bakery sold. 

This location used to always be super-busy at lunch (lines out the door by 12:00!) but every time I've been there since the change there has been minimal to no line.  

Trust corporate America to 'improve' something to the point of ruining it."}
{"text":"I've been to this Panera a few times but today I had a very nice girl take my order. Her name was Monisha I believe. She helped with with my order and she was very knowledgeable about what was on certain items. I got the BBQ chicken. Sandwich and it was good! Nice location and the staff is nice."}
{"text":"The tea bar was fully stocked and the service was really attentive. We only got a drink and dessert but the kitchen sink cookie looks really good. The place was clean and there was plenty of staff to help you. 

I'll come back here for sure.  The parking lot is nice, clean, and safely set away from the road. The store has plenty of seating. The experience is consistent with what you would expect from Panera."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly.  When they brought our food out, we realized that they had put one of our meals in twice.  The server took the food back, refunded the extra cost, and apologized.  That is excellent customer service.  Food was pretty good too."}
{"text":"This place is a waste of space. I've been here twice now and I'm officially not ever going back. This mornings experience pushed me over the edge.

I ordered an egg sandwich, blueberry muffin, and iced triple latte through the drive thru. I get to the window, she hands me my food and a HOT latte... Not a big deal, I tell her I ordered iced and she goes back to fix it. 5 minutes later she comes back and I notice it has foam on the top... She goes \"oh that's just the foam from the milk when it was hot\" hahaha I look at her and I say \"did you seriously just pour a hot latte over ice and try to give it to me?!\" She rolls her eyes, goes back and tells me \"okay we will remake it\" Are you kidding me?? How lazy can you be?? Not only that, when you heat milk up to 160 degrees and then pour it over ice, you're now risking bacteria being formed... Unbelievable. $4.50 for that experience and a gross subpar latte?! No thanks. 

Then I get home to eat my food (I live ONE street down btw) and it's soggy, gross, and falling apart. And the blueberry muffin is the WORST muffin I've had in my life.. It tastes like straight grease. NEVER going back here. I'd rather eat Starbucks breakfast and lunch for less money... How sad is that?

Don't waste your time & money."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times but was here last week, middle of day, before lunch crowd and it's changed.  Was extremely hot in there, tables weren't cleaned from previous diners and restrooms were bad.  The food, Fuji Apple Salad and cup of soup was same as always but just too darn hot, with no air circulating so we took it to go.  Did seem to be a number of employees standing by the drink machines just chatting.  The one in Boca is much better."}
{"text":"As I was paying $5 for a very small cup of soup, an employee comes out of the back carrying a large clear plastic bag filled with soup.  He proceeds to open it and pours the soup in the heated dispenser.  No thanks.  Keep the overpriced bagged soup.  Small portions of mediocre, overrated and overpriced food."}
{"text":"I have Benn going at this location for the  Last four years I walk in on Wednesday February 22, at 8:50pm  Request the ordered  through the tablet like I all was do and ordered my food. 
 waiting for my food about  3min  later while I'm waiting a  manager come to my  table and asked me to leave because the restaurant  close at 9:00pm I ask him what about my food and he said come tomorrow I said  I paid through the tablet and he say I saw that but I  cancel it because it is  dine in we just do take out now I ask him to refund my money and he tell me ask your bank about it he was so rude
I ask him to have some Respect to customer and he said not those one that come after the   Restaurants hour 
And I got from the manager is disrespect dishonest"}
{"text":"In a day and age of gluten-free everywhere you'd think this place would be aware or have options. I do thank the manager for looking. Its funny I try to before I visit a place bit nothing on Web site either. Still great place for a salad, always"}
{"text":"Ordered a bowl of soup with extra baguettes on the side to dip. This is what I always get from panera and I always happily pay for extra bread on the side. However, He got my order wrong and charged me for a bread bowl along with the extra baguettes. I let it go, but I ate my soup in two bites. All I got was an entire plate of bread. I walked up and nicely explained the situation and asked for a bowl of broccoli cheese soup. I paid another $6 for a bowl of soup. He charged me. No big deal, just think it was bad service. If you get it wrong, fix it."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place. I usually come twice a month and always been good but last evening was bad. Went there around 7pm last evening and place was pretty empty. Ordered a pick two which was tuna salad sandwich and soup. Tuna salad was bland and the plate that was given to me which had my soup on it was dirty. Not just a little dirty but really dirty. Looked like brown syrup on it or something. I know if I noticed it the girl who waited on me noticed it. Very disappointed because this was my \"go to place\". There was always a great consistency but not tonight. Plus staff that waited on me looked bored and obviously couldn't care less. I will have to think twice before I come back. Too bad cause it used to be a great place to come!"}
{"text":"I love Panera anywhere I go, however this location lacks some customer service skills. There is regularly a long line and usually only one person taking orders while other employees walk around seeming to be lost. I don't know why they wouldn't have more staff taking orders to move along lines? If they'd improve this issue it would be a perfect restaurant but I've been here too many times and it's always the same."}
{"text":"Very attentive and personal staff! My food is always on point great management and quick service when you need a fast meal !"}
{"text":"Was at this location yesterday and had a horrible experience. We were waited on by Fatima or fahtima however that girl spelled her name, she started off just ok not friendly. Then she got a nasty attitude because she didn't understand my simple order.  After we finished ordering she walked over to the other employee Melissa and they stared at me and snickered. Fatima walked away and the other girl Melissa continued to stare at me rolling her eyes coming near me to give me nasty looks like she wanted to do something. I asked her if she has an attitude, she got nasty with me saying \"girl bye\" etc. I told her to get her manager Sheyenne. The manager and her came out laughing like this was all a joke. The manager just looked at me snickering what is the problem,  I told her the problem she defended her employees and did not listen to what I said just finally said I will talk to them and laughed and said \"Have a good day.\" These ppl were so nasty immature disrespectful. The employees and the manager. First time I have had a problem at this place they all need to be fired!"}
{"text":"Well... Pretty average. They seem to love to over use garlic in all of their soups. I literally will smell for 3 days because of it.  In addition to repelling other humans for a few days, my vegetarian panini was made with turkey. Mistakes happen.  Just a bummer."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend and their customer service is always amazing. I love the kiosks because it makes everything easier!"}
{"text":"Been to this Panera twice.  First time, it took so long to take our order, we just left.  Tried again a month later and the lady taking the orders was not well trained.  Our food came with a different type of bread than what we ordered and my soup did not come with my meal.  They delivered all the food except for the soup and told me they had to make more but could not tell me how long that would take.  We got up, did not touch the food and asked for a refund.  That took another 10 minutes and then we found out a couple of days later that we were double charged rather than refunded.  I called the corporate office and it's now 2+ weeks later and still no refund even through one was promised.  I just filed a dispute with my credit card company to get over $60 back.  Last visit as there are many restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"Good  size store / restaurant. The cashier, and customer service was friendly, courteous, helpful.  The cashier made sure we had the best deal on the way items were rang up (saving us approximately  $5)

Food was delivered  in a reasonable amount of time. The order was accurate, and typical Panera Bakery menu. The price,  was nice to see after a weekend in tourist hot spots which reflected  in the price of items.  Back to non inflated  reasonable prices. The pecan  roll was dry & even coffee  didn't help. The scones  & souffle  was delish.

The gal who was cleaning the dining area & delivering good to the tables,  had a tendency  to wipe the crumbs off  with her hand...instead of disinfectant & a rag.  I am not a germ-aphob, and at home table it may be acceptable  for my family, but not in Health Code standards. .. so check your table to make sure it is clean prior to sitting down"}
{"text":"The cashiers are very nice and helpful - but the food isn't worth it!! They've changed their salads for the worse. And it's way overpriced."}
{"text":"I haven't had a problem here. The food is good and so is the service when I go here :) the layout is awesome. A lot of people have business meetings or just chill with their lab tops here. I just go here for lunch."}
{"text":"I had their lunch with friend and I would have to say its a quite busy place. I had their lunch deals where you get a half a sandwich, soup and chips and a drink. Keep in much this meal would feel like a snack but would cost you a lot.

The concept of Panera is healthy eatery and the food taste good as well. As they showing healthy eatery they are a little pricey. They have a buzzer system where you order and sit. Once your buzzer vibrates you go pick up the food."}
{"text":"I liked it better when it was Paradise Bakery. The quality of food especially for the price just isn't there."}
{"text":"We went to Panera tonight hoping to see the armpit scratcher. No luck. Just had pleasant service from the cashier as we ordered a salad and Mac and cheese and a iced green tea. The only odd thing was our food delivery. The food put it together person just put the bag on the counter. That's it. No words. No smile or encouragement to take the bag. We asked if it was for us and she said, \"yeah\". It was an hour before they closed so we didn't feel slighted."}
{"text":"This location is always well kept, and the staff is friendly with the little communication I've had with them. I love using the kiosks, thanks to my anxiety  The parking is a little tight, BUT what can ya do! My favorite is the Mac n cheese and chips. I don't ever get a drink because the cups make the fountain drinks taste weird and I never know which cup to use, so I skip out. I do enjoy the different healthier drinks they have though."}
{"text":"I don't understand how a new place could look so... old. It's dirty, shoddy, and the layout is crazy. I've been twice and they've gotten my order wrong both times. This is the only Panera I've ever been to, so I don't know if this is the norm, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Really nice Panera!

I think the bowl size has increased for the soups. How nice! 

Broccoli cheddar soup- Delicious! 
Sesame bagel- pretty good. 

I like to sub the French bread for the Bagel. Some places charge a little extra. This one did an even swap. Very nice!"}
{"text":"I really like this place when I'm hungry and too lazy to cook. Their sandwhiches are freshly made, the soups are comforting on a cold day , the salads are huge and the cookies, well what can I say? They're delicious! If possible, avoid the lunch crowd because it does get very very busy. I like to go just before or after, they're not in such a hurry to make your food!"}
{"text":"Overall, I love this Panera, but there is one issue in particular that continues to be a problem. 

I frequently order online for pick up and I always order my soup in a bread bowl. I don't know if it's just this Panera or a company policy, but every time my soup comes in a cup size, not a bowl, and it fills the bread bowl only about 1/3 to 1/2 of the way. If you dine in, the bread bowls are always overflowing with soup. It's a bread bowl, not a bread cup, so I'm not sure why this is. 

I have ordered over the phone before and specified that I'd like enough soup to fill the bread bowl, to which the employee said they would be sure there was. Picked up my order and found there was only a cups worth of soup. When I brought it up to an employee they said I'd have to buy another cup if I wanted more soup than that. 

So since then, I've just been ordering a bread bowl and then an extra cup of soup. Like I said, I love this Panera, I've never had any other issues with it. The staff are so incredibly nice, the food is always fresh, and the restaurant is always clean. 

I'd like to see the Panera's that are following this policy to change as it's unfair to the customers. Orders should be consistent and customers shouldn't be punished for ordering rather than dining in."}
{"text":"This Panera in particular was a bit messy... that's why I chose not to rate it higher. Honestly, if it weren't for the exceptional customer service, I probably would have rated it lower.

I placed my order for dine in to have a quick-ish lunch after my hair appointment. I sat in the front area, back in the corner (this seems to be the gathering place of employees on break) where I had to clean my own table. It honestly seemed as if the tables hadn't been cleaned all day. 

Last time I had been at any Panera, they did not deliver your food (that I recall) so that was a happy surprise that the only thing I had to pick up from the counter was my drink. 

The food was hot and fresh and tasted good. I tried the new turkey apple sandwich which was a great mix of sweet and savory. I also had (my favorite) cinnamon crunch bagel with hazelnut spread. The cashier was kind enough to just give me the hazelnut spread as I had forgotten to add it to my order. I wish I remembered her name, but she was super polite and patient with me and ultimately the reason for my giving this place 3 stars."}
{"text":"This is a brand new location and I really loved it the moment I walked in. It is clean, you can see everything from the front area, the service was polite and efficient, and the food was good as it should be.

We both ordered soup and sandwiches and were very pleased with both the presentation , and flavor.

You have the choice to either order from their kiosks, or from a real person. I suspect that helps considerably with the lunch crowd. As this is a brand new Shopping Center I would suggest that you expect waiting periods at peak hours for a while . There has not been much retail in this area before, and the population density is going to make any restaurant popular if it doesn't fail in service or quality.

The fact that they've built one within a reasonable driving distance of Monroe is also a plus. I will be eating here at a regular basis and will update this review as I do. It seems like they have things under control already however, so I suspect my 5 star rating will not change."}
{"text":"What is there to say....its a Panera.  I do not particularly like the layout of this location....not much seating and it feels very cramped.  I have been here twice and have had polite service...though nothing to blow me out of the water. 

The food is as to be expected with any sort of fast serve chain.  But I am a sucker for bread and the do deliver in that manner as it is their namesake they should."}
{"text":"It is not just another bread store. If you are a bread lover they are for you. The salads and the soups will not disappoint.  I will often go there while traveling for work. I can sit down and order from my laptop or Ipad while working from my table. Your food is served at the table. If my work runs a little long, I grab the app and order another drink. The soups are really great."}
{"text":"I got a half and half sandwich and salad combo. I asked for the blue cheese crumble salad and the club sandwich. 

The salad was old wedge lettuce (literally browning) and sunflower seeds and raisins.  It was gross.  

The sandwich was one side of turkey,  ham and two pieces of microwaved bacon along work lettuce and tomatoe. No cheese,  no condiments.....since when is that a club? 

It was bad.  Oh no wait....the cookie was good."}
{"text":"I was really rooting for panera but this place is kind of a joke...

I've been here...maybe 3 times. Twice with coworkers for lunch and once with my fiancée because he wanted to try it. All 3 times were disappointing! 

1. Sorry but service sucks....staff don't really seem to be happy to be there or care about their job. 

2. Food is meh. A coworker once ordered an AVOCADO salad but only had one bite of it. Seriously? For an avocado salad there should be at least half of one in there. During my last visit I ordered half a sandwich with a Caesar salad...instead I got a garden salad with some vinaigrette dressing I didn't like. Overall their food always seems to be made half-a$$ed.

3. They no longer offer a choice of an apple, chips or bread. They just give you the bread. So if you've never been there you wouldn't even know that there's an option for an apple or chips. Sooo if you're getting a sandwich, guess what? You're getting a side of bread to go with it...

4. HOWEVER, they have really good cookies, pastries and drinks! At least they have that going! Cookies are super soft and tasty! Also their iced green tea and hazelnut coffee isn't so bad! 

5. Too expensive for what you're getting... I could make a better meal with the same ingredients for much cheaper. 

Basically....never going to panera again! Not at this location anyway"}
{"text":"I love Panera Bread, but this location is always out of product. They're always out of bread. I was in there other day and they were out of American cheese and several other items. Really? We always get take out because this location is typically crowded and dirty."}
{"text":"I am done with this place! Food was good, but I'm also here to study and the crew is so freaking loud in the back! One worker just yelled ewwww! I'm not sure i want to know why. I can only assume there is no manager because it sounds like a ton of teenagers going crazy. I used to come to this location to study, but it's impossible to concentrate with the noise. I don't want to hear 2 coworkers talk about school across the restaurant while I'm studying."}
{"text":"The experience here completely depends on which employee you end up dealing with. Most of them are fine, but there are a couple surly teens who obviously do not want to be there and a couple special needs people who work *extremely* slowly.

The food is ok, pretty par for a fast casual sandwich shop. I'm not sure if it's general policy (so people will take \"prettier\" Instagram photos?) or what, but with lunch sandwiches they pile all the ingredients at the cut part of the sandwich so it looks really nice and full...but the back half has nothing in it. So when you pick it up, it's weirdly unbalanced causing stuff to fall out. You can obviously just push stuff around to make it more even, but it's still weird and a little annoying for those of us who don't feel the need to document our food.

One serious \"con\": The bread and bakery is totally unprotected and there is always at least a fly or two buzzing around in summer. I've also seen a couple customers reach right over the shield in front of the bakery to poke and touch the goods..."}
{"text":"It's all about the service and it sucks here

I travel and often have meetings for breakfast; Panera is a good, consistent venue that has options that appeal to just about anyone. Unfortunatley. The poor, unfriendly service at this location makes it unpleasant to visit.  The typical weekday crew is rude and very unpleasant if you have any questions or special considerations.  I took a client here last week and the cashier, after originally telling us that a sandwich couldn't be ordered on a bagel, tried to charge him for a bagel and a sandwich. 

When the error was pointed out to the \"manager\" he responded that we shouldn't have been so difficult in ordering our food. Overall, I've been here a dozen or so times as it's close to my home.  After the last visit, I refuse to donate any more money to this particular Panera."}
{"text":"Just tried to go here after months of not eating here because of the last customer service nightmare.  Well, they closed early to have a staff meeting.  Who does that?  When I worked at Chili's, staff meetings were on Saturday mornings.  No professional company closed their doors to customers to talk to staff.  Incompetent mis-management here!  Multiple issues with this location, and this was the final chance for them to earn my families business."}
{"text":"Big Panera.  It was clean with a friendly staff.  The food came out quickly and was fresh and delicious.  Panera is alway a good choice on our road trips!"}
{"text":"Went to Panera because they have decent coffee and a nice place to sit.  I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, which I thought would be good given the fact they make their own bread and have a giant sign saying \"We're advocates of clean food.  We're committed to menu transparency.\". Well despite the sandwich being like $8, and not saying anything about using processes cheese, the grilled cheese sandwich did indeed use processed cheese...something I would never eat at home or at a restaurant.  Why pay $8 for bread and processed cheese?  I may get coffee here again, but I'm never eating here in the future."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst Panera experience ever.  Our plates and silverware all appeared dirty or poorly washed (or maybe really in need of replacement?). We sat in a booth and shortly into dinner I noticed the back of the booth was smeared with dried sauce of some kind. My soup was cold. My sandwich was strangely wet -- both the inside from too wet lettuce, and the outside for reasons I couldn't identify.  Finally, we ordered items that we then had to go back and ask for because they weren't included in our food.  

It'll be a while before I go back to any Panera. It left a bad taste in my mouth (literally)."}
{"text":"I came to this location on a busy, Sunday afternoon - and perhaps that is why I didn't enjoy Panera as much. I haven't tried their breads/sandwiches, but I am a total fan of their healthy fruit smoothies made with yoghurt. I had the Berry Shake and it was delish. My boyfriend and I also decided to share a Carrot Cake, and a lady soon brought us a big slab of the sweet thing. 

The concept is part fast-food (you order food at the counter) and part restaurant (other than drinks and immediate baked goods, someone brings you your order). This location can get pretty packed and it's not a pleasant place to be. When I came in, the line was close to the door, and the seating area was filled with strollers (that took up the walking space), small tables with 10 chairs around it, or a huge booth with one person sitting. Not that I have anything against strollers or chairs, but its a point to make that the space is designed narrow.

By reading other reviews, the food seems pretty good so I would do a takeout rather than sit in. I wasn't too keen on the \"hectic\" atmosphere of the place, but perhaps this is due to the day (Sunday) and not necessarily the fault of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I love the freshness and quality of food. I had a small issue arise but it was resolved immediately by the courteous staff. 
No complaints, I'm a fan of Panera Bread."}
{"text":"I usually love Panera but this one wasnt that great...especially since it is in Sumerlin.

 I ordered the chinese citrus salad- it was good. The presentation of it didnt look good but the taset was there.  I also had a Bacon Turkey Bravo.  I loved the bread and all the fresh ingredients but there was a little sauce.  I would have liked more sauce so i will to make sure i ask for extra.

Down side to this location- the eating table area was dirty.  The beverage station was dirty.  I would just like them to clean more."}
{"text":"This is a nice and modern location, stopped by for a quick breakfast with my kids.

Nice selection of pastries, bagels, scones and muffins. The croissant was nice and buttery. They do have a microwave so you can warm it up.

Asiago cheese bagel is yummy!! The offered to toast which was great. Cream cheese add on was $1.40 and the bagel was $1.39 which was wired and   pricey.

Mango smoothie ($4.69) tasted more like plain yoghurt than mango, I don't recommend."}
{"text":"Kind of run-of-the-mill, no? (Run-of-the-mill: \"Lacking unusual or special aspects.\")  

Panera used to be a healthier option than all of the other fast food places with more of a restaurant feel. I do believe it was one of the purveyors of this new... fast-casual fad that we have going on currently. Fast food has a stigma, and sadly- Panera is approaching it.

This location doesn't seem very adept at either hiring, or placing staff where they should go. The register person is usually mousy, very hard to hear, and too introverted to be on the front lines of customer service. The person on \"expo\" or whatever you call the five food counter where they precariously perch your order is never there, so if you don't get a smile when ordering your food, you don't even get human interaction when picking it up.

The food is fine. But, Panera is a simple eatery of convenience. If you are looking for a place to gather- I could suggest this. It seems relatively quiet."}
{"text":"Who knew that Paradise Bakery was not just for cookies? The sandwiches are awesome and my fave is the tuna on toast. The salads are really good too, and what about those soups? Tasty and yummy. I'm a fan of this location."}
{"text":"Every time is the best experience. Staffs are nice and friendly. Always helpful with smile :) We used Panera for cater on my wedding day for bridal party's lunch in a limo.  They delivered my order to the church. Panera is a great place to spend a day to study with free refill coffee! Love this place!"}
{"text":"This was a calm place to grab a bite to eat and do some homework. There were so many outlets available which was great. The staff was happy to be there also! I got the tomato soup which was vegetarian! And not made with chicken broth. This is a rare find for sure! The coffee was great and the service was quick! I went around noon on a Friday! Overall great service and food!"}
{"text":"Yay! Panera bread in the Cotswold shopping center!!! I am so glad they have one minutes from my home now! This location is just as good as the others around charlotte. I've eaten in and had orders to go. The employees are very friendly and the service was just right. The food is consistent with every other Panera bread I've been to, and I am a frequent flyer at Panera! I will be coming back to this location to get my bread fix from now on."}
{"text":"I was waiting for a friend and spotted Panera Bread next to me and so wanna give it a try for breakfast. Ordered a cup of latte and an Apple Crunchy Muffin and my husband ordered a cheese, bacon and egg sandwich. I have to admit that the packaging is amazing. Even with my single order of an apple crunchy muffin, they boxed it nicely. 

Apple Crunchy Muffin (score 3/5)
It looks very good by its appearance and really attracts me to choose it. I really love the apple meat that I could eat from the muffin, it may because I love apples, but I find it too sweet. I couldn't finish eating the whole muffin due to it is too sweet, not because I am full.

Cheese, Bacon and Egg Sandwich (score 3/5)
The cheese and bacon are melted and melted into the sandwich. It seems to me there isn't a lot of bacon though the sandwich looks big, I mean wide in dimension.

Latte (score 2/5)
My homemade latte tastes better than the latte at Panera. I could hardly taste the coffee. I am really disappointed . The only good compliment I could say about the latte is it has warmed me up"}
{"text":"I usually stay away from chain restaurants, but decided to give it a shot since it's right aroudn teh corner from my house. I went in for lunch on Saturday and it was PACKED! they have a menu full of sandwiches, salads, pastas and baked goods. i opted for a half sandwich and small pasta, which set me back around $12. The pasta was good, it was this cheese tortellini with pesto. The turkey and cheddar panini had was just okay, super dry and overcooked. The building is nice, but it's the exact reason I don't do chain restaurants. the food just has to be OKAY because of the volume they do.  I'll most likely go back as there are tons of better options in the area for lunch, but if chains are your thing this place is a decent representation."}
{"text":"I had pick two. $3.99($4) veggie soup and spicy Thai chicken 5.29 ($6) for lunch. Totally $10.03+ tip. The salad uses the cheapest lettuce and taste like McDonald quality and soup is ok. Both are much worse than its competitor wild flower at chandler mall. I would suggest going to wild flower instead. Or suggest that you go to pokitrition nearby. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Gave this place a second try with soup and macaroni and cheese (well, shells).  Cold, congealed broccoli cheddar soup.  The baguette and shells were the better options."}
{"text":"I love Panera. It's good coffee, decent food and reasonable prices. It's a large chain, which means it's consistent. We prefer independent outlets or local chains at the most but sometimes there's just a need for a product that's recognizable. I meet my girls here once a month for coffee and gossip and it's always dependable. The breakfast bagel sandwiches are yum. I always switch to an everything bagel since ciabatta isn't my favorite thing."}
{"text":"Just came here for the first time with my hubby, we received a gift card from his work that wouldn't work at the register.  The manager came up and still gave us the credit for it, which was a big help and actually shocking, in a good way!  The food is delicious and tastes like good home cooking.  We found ourselves a jewel- the management and the food will definitely bring us back again soon (even though we don't live nearby.) Overall, a five star experience all around, nothing bad to say about this Panera Bread at all!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food, produce, soups, and sandwiches...  also the employees seem to really enjoy their work and are always helpful and friendly! Free Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"So disappointed with the customer service at this location. I will go to a different location from now on. Three of the people working at the counter that I encountered were rude, unfriendly, and unhelpful. I am stunned at the lack of customer service and lack of an even slightly friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has some food and health safety issues. This food chain may taste ok and look decent but the day I went here there was an employee that was clearly very sick. He would be walking around behind the counter and coughing vigorously(not covering his mouth at all) on the bread and food that is openly displayed throughout the restaurant.  

If you are sick, especially in a food service establishment shouldn't you be staying at home? Can't the manager step in and send the employee home. It just looked like no one thought anything was wrong.

I don't know if my coughing and sore throat is linked to this incident but that same night I had the symptoms.

Anyways bottom line , we will not be returning to this location in the future and I will mention this experience to anyone I know that goes there. 

If you work there and are reading this. Please let your manager know that this is a serious matter. Thanks in advance."}
{"text":"Fun fact: I once spent eight hours in this Panera working on final papers. And it was actually fine (okay I didn't really want to come back to Panera for a while afterwards because I was burnt out but that was no fault of this specific Panera location). The food here is good for Panera -- I particularly like the Green Goddess Cobb Salad -- and consistent as well. I ate all my meals at Panera that day and was not disappointed by anything I ate. The coffee is actually decent, the service is friendly and speedy, and turns out if you spend a lot of time at Panera, you'll rack up a lot of Panera rewards. It's of course totally suburban and bland inside but if you come to Panera expecting anything else, what are you doing? The suburban-ness of it reminds me of home anyway. 

It did get pretty busy right around lunch time which is to be expected but the WiFi remained speedy and no one bugged me and my friend for basically camping out in Panera all day. I think come finals season next semester, I'll be totally ready to come back."}
{"text":"We are sitting in this location right now. We have been in here for 20 minutes and not one person has come out to clean the dining room. We had to bus and clean our own table. The food was subpar and we won't be coming back ever again. This is a very dirty Panera."}
{"text":"Love love love Panera and this location is pretty good!  The service is stellar. They took a long time to bring the food on one visit, but were apologetic when they arrived and offered a bakery item.  The main downside is the construction outside, which is beyond their control, but  an inconvenience nonetheless.  The construction has impacted parking causing the lot to be gravel/unfinished and tight."}
{"text":"I was about to get on the lightrail when a homeless man asked for food. I went in and bought 2 grilled cheeses a bottled water and a lemonade, came to about 18 dollars. I gave him the water and a sandwich and ate the second myself. It was the most boring bland sandwich I have had in years. I was appalled that I gave some one else something so terrible to eat."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other poor reviews, this place just isn't the same. My first experience wasn't great but I gave Panera a second chance, and it was even worse. The atmosphere, experience, and service has gone down so much that I think McDonald's is better at this point. The flow is a cluster and it doesn't appear that any of the staff know what they're doing. It'll be a sad day when all of the Paradise Bakery's are gone."}
{"text":"DO NOT order \"Rapid pickup\" from this location. I ordered food that said it would be ready at 6:00 pm. I waited for 45 minutes while multiple girls in their Panera uniforms talked about their relationships on their cellphones and the food still wasn't ready. I returned to the restaurant around 8:30 thinking that my food would be ready considering they close at 9:00 and my food was never made. I paid for the food that I never got. I will never go back to this Panera location ever again."}
{"text":"I'm still in disbelief regarding this Panera visit. Upon walking in to the restaurant I stopped to admire the pastries in the display. To my dismay there were several gnats all over the croissants on the bottom shelf. I immediately asked one of the employees to come over to notify him of this. His response was \"um yeah, sorry, this is a problem we haven't been able to figure out\" and then he walked away. I'm baffled and losing my appetite by the second. When I get to the counter to order, I say to the cashier, there are gnats all over your croissants. She replies, \"no they're not\" ... so now I'm truly annoyed. She walks over to the counter and pulls the croissants off the shelf and places them on the back counter, disturbing all the gnats so they now find new homes on the remaining pastries. Finally I ask to speak to the manager. While he was very apologetic and handled the situation far better than his employees, I still didn't witness him throw the croissants away. Or any of the other pastries with gnats all over them. Appetite gone. Certainly not in standing with Panera standards. I won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Ordered Panera Bread Delivery for the first time. Everything was packaged well and arrived hot and fresh. Bowls and spoons were provided, as we ordered three quarts of soup. Delivery was prompt and the text alerts were nice."}
{"text":"Pricey! Most of the previous reviewers have mentioned that it's not worth the money for what you end up getting. I usually order the tuna sandwich with one of their soups but mannn, the \"healthy\" facade ends when you go check out their nutritional value. I wish it was actually healthy. Who eats half a sandwich anyway?

The atmosphere is nice and clean and the order and take a seat set-up works well. They bring you your food. It can easily come up to $11 without any drinks."}
{"text":"I went to this Panera location yesterday with a friend for lunch and it was great!  Panera usually has good service, but it was spot on yesterday.  They brought our food to the table (hadn't seen that in Panera before) and the manager was making rounds.

My friend and I were busy chatting and weren't eating very fast and the manager came over to make sure everything tasted okay and to make sure we were satisfied (he said he was worried because we hadn't eaten much!) and offered to refund us or get us another meal if we didn't like it.  We told him that we were just being chatty gals and the meal was wonderful, but that gesture stood out to me!  He genuinely cared whether or not we were enjoying it. 

Panera's food is pretty consistently good at any location, but the manager's customer service made this location stand out!"}
{"text":"This is converted Paradise Bakery.  We used to be regulars of this Paradise Bakery until Pandera purchased the company.  After the purchase we saw the quality of the products decrease and a switch to Pepsi products, so we came back less and less.  Finally Pandera converted this location to a full Pandera.  Kiosks replaced the interaction with the staff and you can no longer see the food being made.  In addition while you can still get the Paradise Bakery cookies, the price has increased approximately $2 per dozen.  I doubt we will be back anytime soon. Fortunately there is a Wildflower just across the street."}
{"text":"Love love love the broccoli and cheddar soup! It goes great pared with the Turkey Bacon Bravo sandwich. Service is always good, I normally do the rapid pick up, my order is always accurate and ready on time. Glad to have a Panera so close to home!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this first-time in Phoenix version of St Louis Bread/Panera Bread Co does not live up to the company's solid reputation of providing high quality dishes and items to consumers. Their menu items are prepared sloppily and ingredients seemed old, tasteless. I grew up eating at St Louis Bread Co (aka Panera), so yes I'm a harsh critic. This location just cannot yet compare to what the majority of other Panera locations elsewhere in the US produce."}
{"text":"Got a tepid cup of coffee at 7:00 am that tastes like it was brewed with tea mixed in with it.  It doesn't appear these people can even do coffee correctly."}
{"text":"Turkey Artichoke Hot Panini, Smoked Turkey Breast, Tuna Salad... Yum! I really enjoy this place. I just wish they had different side items. I don't like potato chips much and the other choices are... an apple or bread. A sandwich plus a side of bread is just too much bread.  Even if it is delicious bakery bread. And an apple? There is no choice of \"braeburn\", \"pink lady\" or \"Gravenstein\". I would want organic and waxfree if I'm going to have an apple anyway. 

I've enjoyed a croissant here a time or three. Maybe four."}
{"text":"I am glad they finally opened and have a drive thru.  It makes it much easier to have a quick and healthy dinner option.  We stopped in on a Friday afternoon and there was no wait.  Our soups and salads were ready quickly and perfect as always.  We even opted for a tasty $0.99 pastry!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, I will not return here the cashier girl is rude and not pleasant. Wasn't listening and still took the order wrong."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a few months and have never had any issues. I love their salads and my kids like the Mac and cheese. Today I spent about $50 on two modern med salads, coffees, and Mac and cheese. While I was halfway done with my salad, I found a GIANT BUG IN MY SALAD. It was missing half its' legs and I assume I probably ate them because I shook up the salad to toss the dressing. I have never had this happen before, I am extremely disappointed because PANERA is not a low class, cheap place to dine. Their prices are up there. The sanitation should be up to par with the prices. I called to speak to a manager and she refunded my two salads and offered a free meal as if I would go back. A full refund of my order today would have been nice.. just check ur salads."}
{"text":"Very busy on a Sunday (1pm) but very efficient service. Good food. 
Soup was wonderful - Broccoli.cheddar.
The soba though tasted too unjapanese.
Orange scone - heavenly!"}
{"text":"Just tried to order two different sandwiches...out of both the types of bread I requested.   What kind of sandwich place runs out of bread?!?!?!"}
{"text":"I personally Love Panera their food is different and tasty, Love the steak sandwich at breakfast, Frozen caramels are delicious and staff is great!"}
{"text":"I work here all the time. Wifi is free as are the soft drink refills. Get a table along the front windows near a power outlet and you can use the window ledge as a credenza. It is a great way to avoid spilling your drink into your laptop!"}
{"text":"Decent but beware many many kids. A private school is near. If you don't mind snooty rich kids then you're ok"}
{"text":"I have had many good meals at this Panera, but recently, service has been inattentive at best. All day I looked forward to ordering my favorite: Fuji Apple Chicken Salad for takeout. I got home and no bread or fuji apple dressing!!! So I went back. No apology. I got home and opened the box. No apple chips!! Never again!!"}
{"text":"I came here for comfort food but got disappointment instead.  Ordered a bread bowl and got loaf of bread and a small amount of soup.  Once I pulled the bread plug out the cavity left was not even filled with the soup they gave in a container. 

Total disappointment."}
{"text":"This place is starting to grow on me. The food is fresh however over priced. If you're looking for semi healthy foods this is a nice choice. Not the best but it is an option. The Greek salad is so yummy. The wait can be extremely long. The drive thru doesn't seem like a drive thru at all. I'm currently in the drive thru now writing this review that's how long I've been waiting."}
{"text":"I visit this location a couple of times a year when I want a quick healthy lunch or dinner. I usually order a full size salad that costs around $13.00. I love the taste and quality of their salads. You may wonder why such a low rating. I always get my meal to go and on a couple of occasions there have been items missing from my meal. They used to have a Cobb salad that had blue cheese, bacon and avocado. Once I got all the way home and opened my salad to find all 3 of those ingredients missing. Not only were they the key ingredients in the salad but also the most expensive. I did call the location and the manager said she knew they were out of the ingredients but the cashier failed to inform me when I ordered. To make up for it she offered a free salad on my next visit. From then on I always check my bag before leaving the store."}
{"text":"We typically enjoy our experiences at Panera - it's consistent, fresh and there are healthy options. That's why we've given this location numerous chances - that and the fact that it's closest to our home. But something needs to be done about this location. The young teens with seemingly no adult supervision working there are ruining this place. Taking too much time to socialize instead of taking care of customers, getting orders right, giving attitude to customers, etc. This and the fact that they're constantly out of basics. We stopped going there for a while, because they'd always be out of items by 6:30pm. We started going back recently, and the food is just not as good as other locations. And it's never as clean (not dirty, but not as clean). 

Yesterday was the straw that broke the camel's back. I made a \"rapid pickup order,\" and it was anything BUT rapid. I got there, and the first thing I noticed was that our items were literally thrown into the bag - salad tossed on top of soup so that the salad was on its side. There were also no beverage cups. I waited a few minutes by the counter as the employees flirted. When they finally acknowledged my presence, I asked for the cups. The young girl couldn't be bothered and told me to ask another employee. I went to the register to ask, and waited first for the cashier to finish with a customer (totally ok) and then as SHE socialized with an employee who came in as a customer. All I wanted was my cups! Finally get them. Get in the car and realize... no bread with our food. AND they threw a plastic spoon and a metal fork in. When we got home, we noticed that the soup was only about 2/3 full, and the salad wasn't completely full either. It's as if they can't even be bothered to take their time and get things right. That's my issue with this location. These employees seem unsupervised, and no one is there teaching them to get things right. And when you try to resolve something, they get an attitude. We've never experienced these issues at other locations and have given this one more than enough chances. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Panera Bread in general. While I don't think it's all that healthy (even though it's mostly salads and sandwiches, the calories definitely add up. 

I'm not a big green tea fan, but for some reason Panera's Green Tea is SOO incredibly delicious. They even offer refills here (other panera locations don't. believe me, I've asked). I love the strawberry/poppyseed salad but it's a seasonal item. 

There's also a nice selection of food for the little ones, although you're dropping almost $6 on a PB&J or Mac N Cheese. If you order a YOU-PICk-TWO combo you can throw in a dessert item for $0.99."}
{"text":"I love Panera.  My entire family loves Panera.  The soups, sandwiches, the salads--even the cookies and bagels--are all tremendous.  So, why can't I give the Panera nearest to my home more than three stars?  

Where do I begin?  Maybe I begin with the fact that the management of this location has gone so far downhill in the past 6 months.  There's always something wrong with our order.  It can be no other way.  They short me on the soup.  They run out of baguettes--at 6:45 in the evening.  They don't put chicken on my daughter's CHICKEN Caesar Salad.  I could go on and on...  Suffice to say, there is a management issue.  The workers seem overwhelmed and the manager doesn't seem terribly accommodating. 

Maybe I should give them 2 stars but, as I said, I love Panera.  When Panera is doing Panera things right, it's wonderful food.  Perhaps I can recommend the Panera at Waterdam Plaza again at some point.  At the moment, the best I can do is tell you that a) Panera is excellent, and, b) THIS Panera leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Panera is a great spot to work and hang out for a couple hours without feeling pressured to buy a ton of food. Actually, I didn't buy anything at all. I'm sure they didn't like that, but no one said anything.

It's worth echoing the other reviews on atmosphere: cozy, clean, and quiet. Just what you would expect from Panera."}
{"text":"Not only is the food always delicious and fast, the employees at this location are wonderful. This past weekend I ate here and when I got home realized I had lost my keys. Not sure where I lost them, I came back to Panera (last place I remember seeing them) and three different employees helped me look around for them. When we didn't find them, two employees dug through two bags of trash just in case I threw them out. They wouldn't even accept a tip! Other employees offered other suggestions of places to look for my keys/places to go to for help. Truly great service on all fronts."}
{"text":"Spinach and bacon souffle is awesome! Green iced tea infused with passion fruit and papaya with is awesome! The lady with the short hair waking around asking if customers are doing ok is awesome! Only gripe I have about the place is that the girl at the cash register asked me three times if I was ready to order and I'm really indecisive so it stressed me out. It's better than no service though so five stars for you panera bread!"}
{"text":"I gave been coming to this Paradise Bakery and Cafe on and off for 6 years since we moved to Phoenix.  We moved from Dallas where impeccable service is essential to survive in the restaurant business.  I came in to order a espresso drink and oatmeal.  No attempt to start making the coffee while there is no one else at the counter or a line.  I sit down to wait for the coffee and oatmeal. 10 minutes later the oatmeal comes and no coffee.  I have to ask someone to check on the coffee. 15 min later the coffee comes!  And the cafe mocha was horrible!

This place used to be ok, but in the last 2 years the service is pitiful.  A similar incident happened several months ago and I swore I would stop coming, but I had to use the last of a gift card.  Never again.  All my friends have also stopped coming because of the slow and poor service.  Too bad, because PB&C in Dallas is awesome.  Gives the company a bad reputation."}
{"text":"Nice, clean and friendly service.  Not the closest to our home, but we prefer this Panera."}
{"text":"Free internet, close to home, decent coffee, bread, and sandwiches are some little reasons why I go to Panera all the time, distance being the biggest factor.

I used to frequent a place in Etobicoke called Artisano bakery and this place reminds of that. Its like these 2 places used the same template for setting up shop. Same sort of casual ambiance with that vibrating  gizmo when your order is ready, same type of food, and very similar price range. I'm a sucker for these kinds of places.

I have to admit Artisano has slightly better sandwiches and given a choice I'd probably skip Panera. Since I have no choice, I just learn to appreciate the good things, sit back, and enjoy."}
{"text":"The foods eats just like any other Panera.  The ingredients are fresh as is the yummy bread.

The restaurant it's self is clean and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Piece of shit company that obviously treats their employees like crap because nobody wants to be there. The cost of food is outrageous"}
{"text":"I just left this location completely unsatisfied. We weren't sure what we wanted so we let the people behind us go first. Turns out they were friends with the cashier. They stood there a talked for 10 minutes. Laughing and flirting. The line grew behind us. Only one cashier. There were multiple mangers standing around doing nothing. When it was our turn the cashier realized her line had grew. She turned to the Manger and asked if she was the only one and his response was \"yup\" when he should have jumped on and helped her get her line down. LAZY LAZY LAZY. Our food was delivered fast but wrong . My husband ordered a bread bowl for his soup it came out in a cup. He nicely told the kid and then the kid said \"well is it fine like that?\" Uh no it's not we paid for a bread bowl we want what we paid for. He was put out he had to get it fixed. I order a Carmel coffee large it came out small... didn't get that till I was done with my lunch. No more cookies with the kids meal or your meal. Needless to say we miss Paradise bakery. We won't be back to this location. We only came because Zupas is closed on Sunday's. This place needs an manger and staff make over ."}
{"text":"We always go to the Panera at the district.  Stopped by this one because it was closest to what we were doing.  I will say that we won't be back.  The store is dirty, bathrooms are filthy and the servers & manager look like slobs.  From head to toe they look completely unkempt.  They got my salad order wrong 3 times and the salad was mushy when it was finally right.  While eating, I watched two other women go back up to the serving counter with wrong orders.  I would go to a different Panera...just saying."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere...very chill & relaxing!  Love to go and get the hazelnut coffee.  They provide a great selection from soups (cream of chicken & wild rice is my fave...autumn squash is my husband's fave), salads, sandwiches and noodle bowls.  Their sandwiches are not the greatest... Still trying to find one I like.

My mom and I usually go for coffee & CRUMB CAKE, which is to die for!!!!  The scones are amazing, as well... You have to try.

The only negative is their portions are somewhat small for the price; sometimes I  leave hungry.   With that being said, this is my go-to place.  If you join the rewards program, it comes with discounts & free meals.  Also, during your birthday month, you get a free coffee everyday for the month!!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant location.  The staff always greet me with a warm smile. My order is always correct and prompt.  The food is good too.  I eat here at least once per week"}
{"text":"Seriously...you are out of whole wheat baguettes and then give me a bowl of chicken noodle soup with 2 noodles and all broth (really, not kidding!) ?!?! If I hadn't already been at home, I would've gone back for a refund. Maybe it's time to move on from Panera...especially in a city where there are many other choices and locally owned delis. Even at other locations, I have found Panera's quality has gone downhill while their prices have increased."}
{"text":"So everyone knows what Panera has to offer I'm assuming, as it's a chain. Had a business meeting here the other day and was impressed by the amount of seating area. Easy to find a quiet place for conversation during the mid-late afternoon hours. Service was friendly as always. My only complaint is that the coffee hadn't been changed in a while so I ended up having 3 different coffee selections in one cup because they kept running out. It was called the \"surprise java mix\":."}
{"text":"I once loved PB, but it seems to have lost its luster, at least this one has.  I had a breakfast sandwich and I swear it tasted as if it were frozen and microwaved.  My friend wanted an omelette or scrambled eggs and they had neither.  I wondered if they even make egg bagel sandwiches.  And they no longer sell the multigrain baguettes that I loved so much.  It just doesn't compare with other Mom and Pop soup and sandwich bakeries any more."}
{"text":"I am a fan of all Panera Bread establishments. The homemade soups are divine!  The pasta is always hot and filling,the sandwiches are packed with meats and veggies,depending in what you order and the Asian shrimp Thai salad is amazing!! It's big enough to share for two. The orders always come out nice and quick and every staff member I have dealt with,whether it be ordering or someone taking my empty dish,they are always very friendly."}
{"text":"Location Location Location, This Panera is located in the perfect spot right in Ballantyne Village where everyone think they are \"holyier than thou\" or shall I say \"the chosen people\". I actually had a place in the area temporary while building my home and got a true taste of the people in the area. Love Love Love everything to do in the area but the people are a different story.

Now regarding this Panera, the food is okay it's not the best. I had to send back my Avocado egg white breakfast sandwich several times because it came out BURNT, then again ice cold, then third time missing ingredients. The younger cashiers are not that friendly and don't know how to provide good customer service.

I've been to plenty Paneras and this one is lower on my totem pole as I rather go to the new one at the Arboretem where they are pleasant and professional and I've never had to send my food back.. Plus the people don't act like they have a stick up their rear end."}
{"text":"Worst experience 
Peter and another employee were bantering back and forth as I was giving him our order,  this was the first time we had been there.  Peter came around the counter handed me my bag and I left,  after walking home I saw I didn't have my whole order. I went back and told Peter I was missing my bagel. First,  if he wasn't goofing around and paying more attention to the customers and had He told me I was suppose to go to wait for my bagel than my order would of been correct.  I'll never go back again"}
{"text":"While I love some of Panera's food, the new system of ordering and picking up at this location is frustrating.  Unfortunately, it takes more time to enter your own order on the touchscreens provided than waiting in line for a human to take your order.  It is, however, encouraged to self-order.  Also, the butter has been taken off of the condiment bar, so if you love butter with your bread, you'll have to ask several times (and get strange looks like you're a butter-obsessed freak) in order to get it.  

On the plus side, the MOZZARELLA TOMATO PANINI is delicious, especially if you add extra tomato chutney.  And the soups are always good.  Especially in a bread bowl (if you don't mind 1,000 cals for lunch)."}
{"text":"When I first learned that Panera was opening up in the University area (near where I work), I shouted, \"Hallelujah!\"  I've always loved the comforting feeling one gets in a Panera and I've never been disappointed in their lunches, breads, pastries, breakfast, or coffee.  

I think by now I've sampled everything on the menu so now I know exactly what I want and order the same thing every time. The You-Pick-Two combo offers you a choice of two of the following: soup, salad, sandwich.  I mix it up a little bit depending on my hunger and the temperature outside, but it usually involves two of the three:  cream of chicken and wild rice soup, French onion soup, Caesar salad, tomato and mozzarella salad (summertime only) and -- my favorite -- the Frontega chicken panini sandwich.  As my side, I take their super-crunchy potato chips and bring them back to work for a snack on another day.  Wash it all down with a cup of their hazelnut coffee and I've had a satisfying lunch. 

This Panera has always offered great service with a smile and cooked my order very quickly.  Never a problem."}
{"text":"I love this place, so happy the company stepped up and got rid of a lot of preservatives in their food, that's why I started coming back, and happy to be eating here again"}
{"text":"One of our favorite \"go to\" places after a long day at work and we're too tired to cook.  Love the Mac and Cheese and the Asian Chicken Salad.  I feel like there's enough choices that I can indulge, if I choose, or pick healthier options. 

My only irritation:  I prefer to eat sitting in a booth and the tables are usually filled with people sitting by themselves with their laptops with maybe an espresso drink and no food. 

While it may be Panera *Bread*, I've actually never tried their bread."}
{"text":"I stopped here after I visited my dentist today!  Good staff, consistant service.  They are always sugggesting other menu choices.  And they definietly know their menu....Clean facility."}
{"text":"If I were judging Panera for what it is.  A CHAIN, a slight step up from fast food, then they get a four.  But the real issue is, that there are so many delightful restaurants in Chagrin Falls that are not chains.  And their food is a surprise when you order, an unexpected, wow that's awesome!  Whereas Panera is, yeah, this tastes like what I had before.  This location is very consistent.  Properly staffed and clean.  The restrooms are always clean, as well.  So, if you can't think to try something downtown or on the outskirts of Chagrin and you must go here then It is what it is."}
{"text":"So just a little irritated to say the least!! I Don't expect much when you order by phone such as cleanliness Or great service because I'm not going inside and or really having any interaction with employees! Now we love Panera because the soups and sandwiches are very good and there always great choices plus it's a healthy choice over normal fast food !! 

I would say this could be easy to screw up other than it was an online order with very straightforward instructions on my order ! We ordered soup , salad and two sandwiches! One sandwich was a ham and cheese with nothing on it and guess what ? It had everything on it !! Please see attached photos! We were also missing our other side of chips !!"}
{"text":"Tough day for this Panera store.  

While waiting to order I watch three employees trying to figure out who ordered what.  A poor guy is standing waiting for his bagels while they try bag up cinnamon rolls.  No biggie, except it was an indication to a disorganized, slow and frankly messy experience.

I order my sandwich, get my large drink cup and have to ask where I get my food. Around the corner, I fill my drink and stand for literally 20+ minutes while others pass me by.  Including a worker who gets her own food while we stand and wait.  They holler that they are sorry but they are waiting on eggs.  Ok.  Others then walk up, wait and then get their EGG sandwiches while I continue to stand...  I ask if my order had been lost. \"Nope, getting to it right now.  A lot of things aren't ready\"

Ok...  then they don't have the right cheese.  I don't really care.  Yellow vs white cheddar.  Fine.

I'm finally handed my \"to go\" bag, though it was for here. Ok, again.

I head upstairs and there are chairs piled up in the corner... I sit at a table and it's covered in crumbs.  I wipe down the chair.

My sandwich was squashed.  It tasted decent, yes, and why I didn't give only one star.

I walk to the drinks upstairs because I've now been here for quite a while and wanted a second refill. There is one unmarked tea/coffee/mystery dispenser.  I opt for a known commodity and soda.  The fountain practically sprays me, but hey, at least there was no actual soda in it.  Just soda water.  I dump the non-soda and sit down to start to write this...

It seems that there is disorganized management.  A culture that has accepted mediocre service.  The culture is such that I'd expect a defensive response to this review.  I wouldn't expect them to take responsibility.  

If it were a culture of personal responsibility, I wouldn't have needed to write this in the first place.

At least the wifi is fast!"}
{"text":"Too many guys with computers. Crowds out the people wanting to eat the food. Huntersville needs more WiFi connection businesses."}
{"text":"Triple check your drive thru order. The last FOUR TIMES in a row mine has been incorrect (wrong soup twice, missing milk and wrong yogurt for my kiddo)."}
{"text":"I recently went to this location, first time going to Panera Bread. I first ordered a half sandwich with chips and a cinnamon crunch scone. It was delicious! I ended up purchasing the same sandwich but full, with chips and another cinnamon crunch scone to take home. I do wish there was a location closer to me, all are at a far distance. Overall this place is great!!!"}
{"text":"Typical Panera bread location. Was still busy at 730pm. I got a Thai chicken salad, the full size and it was huge. Affordable quick option."}
{"text":"Panera never seems to disappoint. 

If you are looking for a quick salad, sandwich or soup that is if not healthy is at least will not heavy this is the place for you. 

Came during the lunch hour and while there was a line it moved quickly and the staff turned tables over as quickly as possible. 

The bread here is fantastic."}
{"text":"I very much enjoy Panera. I can't go there without getting the broccoli cheddar soup with the French baguette.  I would give Panera 4 or 5 stars, but I can't do that because I have different feelings for when I dine in or when I carry out.  

When I dine in, it's great.  The portions are very reasonable and it is always very fresh.  The salads are huge (even the half salads).  I wish I felt the same about carry out.

When you compare what you get when you dine in verses what you carry out, it seems like you get 1/3 less than what you would get when you eat in at the same price.  The salad is much smaller and the soup is in a far smaller container.  I would give Panera a higher rating if they would fix this."}
{"text":"Great healthy options for lunch or dinner! Both the hubby and I work so healthy options are a go to at Panera with their salads and You pick two--half sandwich and soup or salad choices. I love the Green Goddess cobb salad with chicken or the Asian Sesame chicken salad. The chipotle chicken sandwich and the chicken noodle soup are my favorites. Also like the roasted turkey and avocado blt sandwich. Typing these names I see how I'm a meat eater and have a fondness for chicken:)
This location is busy but the easy swipe station is helpful for when you're getting takeout. Parking is a bit crazy at dinner but you can also use the garage."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great healthy options for lunch or dinner! I like the asian chicken salad for the healthy lunch. The turkey bacon avocado is awesome with the chicken soup, you pick two meal deal. The pastries are delicious too. I like the cinnamon crunch bagel for breakfast if I'm feeling indulgent. The patio is nice for summer days.  The green tea is a delicious hot weather drink. They have good to go options and nice service."}
{"text":"I have never experienced anything like this at a glorified fast food chain.  I ordered at the kiosk to \"avoid the line\" as they call it.  Only to wait for 40 minutes.  For two turkey sandwiches.  They did NOT inform me of the wait until after I had ordered and paid.  Never again. Panera will never get my business again."}
{"text":"My name is Hitt, I'm from Pittsburgh PA.  I do many things but one of the things I like to do is experience everything I humanly can from foods to places plus people and things.  Rather than write a long review and clutter the reviews with anymore long reviews (no knock, you guys are great) I'm just gonna get right to the point...

This place? 

Get white girl wasted on paninis and soup.
Wifi for those piczZZ
North Hills price but on the waterfront.
Shut up about your diet and get a cookie.
And a bagel for the morning."}
{"text":"Don't expect much from this location. We just ordered a fair amount of food at a hefty price and almost every order was messed up. We did the online ordering and things were clearly omitted, however, found their way onto every order and paid for items that were not included. Also the poor attitude of whomever answered to phone when we called to check if the order was ready, was completely uncalled for. If you like salty attitudes, your order wrong and paying for things you don't get, this is the place for you. But if you want decent service and  getting what you order avoid this location!!"}
{"text":"Talk about a complete 360! There is a nice young man that literally always clears the table for me while I'm working on my laptop. The cashiers are friendly, patient and knowledgeable about the product - I can be quite indecisive - so this is very helpful. Even better... Each time I have visited and wanted a croissant... They have it! Even after 5PM! Kudos to management and staff. I have become a regular and clearly so have a lot of other people because I am always walking around looking for a seat.

My only other wish is that there were more outlets in this location. But I guess they did not provide outlets to avoid the place turning into a \"web cafe.\""}
{"text":"Great fresh and healthy food! Clean place and friendly staff! Salads are fresh and healthy. Soup is delicious. Just the right portion sizes. The iced green tea with passion fruit and papaya is the best!"}
{"text":"I'm  a Panera Bread fan but after this experience and their prices. hummmm.
I have order the turkey cranberry flat bread and it was a total deception."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Panera location in town, and that I have ever been to. They have extremely friendly staff who don't turn over constantly, so you are greeted by familiar faces that learn your order, and always take care of any issues you may have.

The general manager Luke strikes up conversation with me every morning, asks how things are going with me, and is genuinely interested in me as a person. The same goes for Ashley, a bubbly ray of sunshine even at 630AM. Maddy, Natalie, and Bianca who work the front register are all phenomenal as well. The assistant/catering managers are all wonderful. I've only had a handful of not-so-good experiences, but that is to be expected.

I will say that the morning crew is leaps and bounds better than the afternoon crew. That may be because of different staff, or because there is so much more going on at lunch and dinner time that makes it hard to manage. Either way, I love this Panera!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular at any Panera that is close to or on my way to work.  I worked close to this location and went for lunch/dinner and sometimes breakfast at least a few times a week.  The managers and employees will learn your order if you are a regular, and they always make it a point to strike up conversation.  There isn't a single thing on the menu that you can go wrong with at any Panera, and with everything made on-site, and daily leftovers going to local food banks, you feel good about eating at what is essentially a fast food chain, when you get down to it.

Good food, great atmosphere, wonderful staff at all locations, and their fresh brewed tea (unsweetened) is a personal addiction of mine."}
{"text":"Wish I had looked at the reviews first. We just had lunch and the grilled cheese barely had any cheese and wasn't grilled at all. The chicken noodle soup broth was good but lacked chicken and noodles. Rename it broth."}
{"text":"The broccoli cheddar bred bowl is my go to. I really never get anything else because this is just so goo!!! I also have a panera member card. So I rack up my points and get yummy rewards! Their green tea is amazing!! Hands down my go to place when I'm indecisive about what I want to eat."}
{"text":"I feel the Panera has been progressively going downhill over the past couple years. This particular location has failed me several times. Mostly when I get food to go or choose rapid pick up. Make sure to double check that they got your order correct. My recent incident was that they failed to put sauce on my sandwich... I asked for three different kinds of sauces and I barely got one..."}
{"text":"I have mixed reviews about Panera.  The good first.  Great place to get a quick lunch and the food is usually fresh.  Now onto the bad-the prices are outrageous!  I met a group of friends for lunch and one friend's bill came to 14$ for a drink and salad!  The Panera in Oakland also gets crowded especially during the lunch rush where orders take a lot longer than normal and it is hard to find a seat. I do like their bagels and pastries-the cookies are delicious!  My typical lunch order is the bacon turkey bravo-love the bread they put this on. I also often times get the potato or broccoli cheddar soup. The you pick two option is great where you can choose two out of the three soup, salad or half of a sandwich plus a side. I do like how they give you the option of a roll, apple or chips as your side."}
{"text":"Panera Bread is great! The employees are energetic and full of life. This location was huge and spaced out well. I ordered the smoked turkey sandwich on asiago focaccia bread. Sandwich was made to perfection I must say. Fresh green lettuce and tomatoes, melted swiss cheese, and came with a broccoli and cheese bread bowl.

Everything wad made fresh to order. They even have you seat yourself then bring the food out to you when its ready. The seating is a bit crowded if you don't have a booth or you're not sitting outside. They offer free WiFi as well.

Overall, the food is inexpensive and Panera Bread is a great place to enjoy your lunch break on. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Consistent and delicious. Staff here is always working their hardest and it's apparent in the constant flow of patrons throughout the restaurant."}
{"text":"Every time we have ordered \"to go\" for a small group (3 -5) they have messed it up - missing sandwiches, and missing soups. The first 2 times we thought it a fluke due to careless or carefree staff. Whenever we've called they've been friendly, corrected the mistake, and even offered a free pastry, but after it happened again tonight, we're done.  3 times to many!"}
{"text":"Beautiful new location. Service was top notch, food tasty, and wifi was speedy!  I had the oatmeal with strawberries and quite enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Went in early on Saturday, really wanting some hazelnut coffee before work. There weren't that many people (2 in line being helped) when I walked in and it took forever for them to get their stuff together and ring out a coffee. I counted 8 staff members - more than customers by far. Finally went to fill my coffee and had a feeling it would be out based on the brew time (about an hour before). Sure enough, got 1/3 cup before it ran out. I let them know it was out and they started calling for someone from the back while there were numerous staff members out front. They called for this person twice and I decided it wasn't worth the wait. Never wanted my $1.98 back more than this morning! Will take the few extra minutes to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Panera is always excellent. This visit I tried something new: the oatmeal. With strawberries cinnamon and sugar. Simple and delicious.
The WiFi is strong and there are several to choose from."}
{"text":"As always the food is good but the prices are a little insane. For just a simple half sandwich and tiny soup with a drink it's 12.50. The kids meal is very lacking. I paid like $7? I believe and it was a tiny PB&J....or grilled cheese, or ham and cheese, a go gurt and a juice..... I mean you get more at McDonalds for half the price. The food is always good and I enjoy the place but the kids meal is pathetic for the price... need to step it up. I love the soups, I love the bread, I love the drinks, I love the sandwiches. Please. My 8 year old always eats some of mine because the kids meal is made for literally 4 and under...."}
{"text":"This is the most unorganized understaffed panera I have encountered
Avoid kiosks - dysfunctional"}
{"text":"Breakfast of choice when I have to get breakfast on the go. I always always go with either the Mediterranean Egg White, the strawberry cinnamon oatmeal, the avocado egg white or a bagel (last resort and in a hurry).
Since I don't always go out for breakfast it's good to have a choice spot.
This location is nice to just go have a smoothie and relax in the open air patio which is a great asset to this location. 
The wifi is a little suspect from the patio which defeats the purpose of having a business breakfast during nice weather on the patio.
The parking lot is pretty technical as it is shared with the neighboring McDonalds and you have to go through McDonalds to exit Panera. For those who are trying to change their eating habits from CRAP to much healthier (crap/sorta not crap) may be tempted by Mickey D's seeing as how they must go through.
The Arboretum is very busy during breakfast and lunch and even dinner for that matter and there isn't enough spaces on Panera lot so I would suggest parking across in the mall lot between Panera and Walmart.
I adore the new system where the buzzer they provide isn't actually a buzzer it automatically informs the runner what table you are on simply by you placing the buzzer on your table. Pretty high tech if you ask me and very much appreciate it beats trying to hold a table and listen for your name to be called and hauling all the food to the table."}
{"text":"Love the food but the worst service ever!! I hope the franchise owner realizes that it's not only about the food, but the employees are what make a restaurant. Patrick the manager was rude and argumentative about a order mix up and Amanda, the girl who made the salad incorrectly, was rude and surly. She was not only rude, but kept giving me dirty looks when I was talking to Patrick about the mix-up. I won't be going back to this particular Paradise because when I spend my money on eating out. I want to have a positive experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I literally waited 30 minutes (no exaggeration) for a bead bowel until we went back to the register and got a refund.  There was a few others doing the same and another woman walking by said she \"waited 30 min for a drink\" and saw a worker \"dump the soup back in and was disgusting\" and that was all we needed to hear to decide to leave.  Can't say we'll ever go back."}
{"text":"This is a poor excuse for a Panera bread. Every other one I've been to has been very good, however this one was very disappointing. We ordered the ham egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and one of the eggs was suppose to be over easy and it came out hard. Another one came out with one tiny price of cold ham and an even smaller piece of cheese. The coffee was horribly bitter. I don't normally like to complain out places but I don't want anyone else to waste their money on this place."}
{"text":"I have been to a few Panera breads around the Las Vegas area but I have never received service this great! I went to this location with a friend of mine to have lunch and was right away greeted by smiling faces. The cashier Alex that took my order was wearing a pink shirt (which I loved) but I didn't notice that she was the general manger!  I ordered my food to which she helped me decide what to get and suggested I try the chili which I never had and I end up loving it! She was so kind she brought out my food and continued to check on me throughout the time I was there which I thought was incredibly nice! I even noticed how well she ran the cafe staying on top of the orders and even going to the kitchen to help out, I was very impressed! When I finished my meal I waved her over because I wanted to know her name and thank her personally for her great customer service and that's when I noticed she was the manger! It's not often I go to places and get 5star treatment from the manger! Usually they are in the back or in the front looking over everyone else but Alex took the time to make sure every customer was well taken care of and for that I will not go to another Panera! The new rainbow location is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously such a nice panera. Opens early (6am) has a little cafe area by where you order (think a individual study sesh or quaint chat with a friend) & then more traditional seating (larger groups, more room to spread out) by the pick up area.

This one serves breakfast until I wanna say 11ish? But all other items are available at all times. You Pick 2's are so pricey now! But you can choose ANY half sammie and upgrade to a bowl of soup vs. just the cup.

Wonder what that \"no meal upgrade\" means on your receipt? It means you passed up the chance to get a bakery item at a *special* price. Don't make that mistake again!

PS - Get a chai latte, you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Zero stars for service, cleanliness, and food quality! The attitude of management is BELOW ZERO. When we complained about the incompetence--40 minutes for a bowl of not even warm soup and yesterday's stale bread, the \"manager\" got mouthy and said we were disrespectful for arguing with Justin the assistant manager that training new employees on my time was not an excuse to not fill food orders. Just unbelievably awful every time we think we will give them a chance."}
{"text":"Drive to another Panera instead of this one every time. Even st 8:30PM with no one line I still waited over 35 minutes for a Pick 2. During lunch it's even worse."}
{"text":"I will start off with what I love about this place...you can get a salad in the drive-thru. How is that not awesome? I have a toddler and the last thing I want to do is park, take him out of the car, put him on my hip, fight with him to not get down and run around while I wait in line and for them to make my lunch. He's happy in his car seat. Happy toddler, happy mom.
Now, the problems with the drive-thru:  you never know what you've got until you get home and open the bag. 
I have been here many times: several times they have forgotten \"no onions,\" so I have to pick those off. Many, many times they have forgotten my lemon, which means a dry salad. Luckily, between my lemon tree and my neighbors lemon tree, that is also a quick fix. My roll. My delightful, crack-roll, as I call it. Yes, it was a sad day when I got home and there was no roll in my bag. Today? Today they did not have large sized cups. How does this happen?  And last, but not least, during a different day, I ordered the apple-something-or-another salad (was Fuji Apple salad at Paradise)  and by the time I got home, my dried apple slices were droopy and partially rehydrated. I think the salad was pre-made and sitting in the refrigerator for awhile. Not good. I live 3 minutes away. I seriously doubt that the apples would be that floppy and un-crunchy in 3 minutes.
I keep going back. Why, you ask? Drive-thru salads close to home. Who else has a yummy selection of salads in the drive-thru? And, my kids love their mac&cheese."}
{"text":"Just like any other Panera, this one is definitely up to company standards. Coffee is being constantly brewed freshly and the aroma is pure and delicious. All the employees are very kind as well and willing to help out with the menu if needed. Great service."}
{"text":"I have a business lunch meeting happening right now and i tried to place an order online.  Well.  The website would not let me complete the order so i just came down to the location to place the order.   
The cashier at the register was so kind. He got the manager just to try to assist with my situation as i was on a deadline to also get to an appointment.  The manager.  Who i had already heard tell another customer that she was out of luck for her situation came over.  He was hurried as it is the lunch rush and clearly frustrated.  I explained and told him all i wanted to do was place the order.  So he walked away.  As the cashier.  Who was just helping alleviate the line took my order.  Adding the names to each lunch...the manager walked up and informs me sharply that it is the lunch rush and will not be adding any names to the lunches.   
I just held my breath for a moment then continued with my order. 
I cancelled my appointment and am waiting for my teams lunch.  
They are busy.  I get it.  But man oh man.  My customers would take me to the cleaners for that attitude.  
Good thing I'm in the customer service industry as well and understand that everyone has bad days."}
{"text":"My go to place for a quick and healthy lunch. I usually always get the pick 2 special with your choice of half of their sandwich/panini, soup, or salad. My favorite would have to be the Tomato and Mozzarella panini and I pair it with the creamy tomato soup. This soup is by far the best creamy tomato soup I have ever had. Its thick, creamy, rich, and very savory. I've never had any of their bread or pastry items but all of them look hot and fresh... of course why else would they call it Panera BREAD! This place is perfect for getting some school work done since they have free wi-fi or if you need a place for a quick, healthy business lunch."}
{"text":"I used to love Panera but as the years have gone by their standards of both food and service has declined greatly. It's a gamble if you are going to get good food and service or if the D team is working that day and they serve cold soup and sandwiches that look like Stevie Wonder  made them. I have to be deserate now to go there, like travelling on the Ohio turnpike and my other rest stop options are burger king and popeyes. Coprorate needs to improve and manage  their quality control,training, and processes. It's like they came out with a bang and now are just coasting."}
{"text":"So sad to see Paradise Bakery leave with their amazing menu and great low prices. Now we have a over priced and very few menu choices. My children don't like one thing. Since I have 4 children I will not be eating here ever."}
{"text":"Panera Bread is a chain that I used often back when I was in SF. They have good sandwich, soup, salad and coffee, as well as the nice seats, power outlets and all combined, qualified as a comfortable place to work.

I like this location over other places in town, it's somehow better in food quality and in seating / layout."}
{"text":"I love that this location is in the Bakery Square plaza. There's only one line to order unlike other Panera locations where there might be a separate counter just for pastries. 

There's a parking garage that allows free parking for 3 hours without requiring any validation. Other than that, parking is a bit limited especially since there are lot of new stores popping up in the plaza, like West Elm. 

I love Panera food options but it always seems really pricey. My favorite  is the Iced Green Tea."}
{"text":"Bad costumer service. Asked what soups they had available at 10:30 and you would have thought I asked for a medium rare steak. Manager forcefully changed the menu to lunch menu and was visibly frustrated. Also when asked what gluten free items they had she only offered one cookie. Probably best to order online so you don't have to interact with anyone working."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak and cheese panni and had to send it back 2 times as the steak was not cooked. Then the panni was too hard from all the reheating. The cashier never offered us chips or fruit."}
{"text":"I came here for take out, I ordered the chicken tortellini Alfredo with chicken noodle soup, also got the roast turkey wheat berry salad, granted I didn't realize when I got home my soup wasn't there, but I called, and got top service, offered to upgrade for the bigger soup size, everyone is pleasant and all smiles, would recommend this place for sure"}
{"text":"I went here with my mother and father in law. We really didn't know what to expect if it was like a subway or if it was something else. We were greeted warmly and were helped with a selection of sandwich we wanted. Well I wish I could give a honest review of the meal but they so happened to mess up the entire order. I'm not sure how it was done but needless to say it was. So someday I hope to go back and give a more solid review of the food."}
{"text":"I ordered the half sandwich with a soup. The chicken wild rice soup was delicious! Very hearty and creamy, with sweet pieces of carrot. The chicken salad sandwich was also very good. The bread is what makes this sandwich a 5. I washed it down with a refreshing hibiscus tea and ended the meal with macadamia nut cookie.  I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"3 stars because I have had better. It is a weird set up inside and can be confusing for a first time customer. The chocolate chip cookies was the best part of the meal. My asian salad was okay and my mediterranean chicken pita was not good. Maybe I'll try something else next time."}
{"text":"There were ants on the wall never eating there again I love the food but if it is going to be infested with ants no thanks."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!  Essentially a self serve coffe shop... Gourmet prices for mediocre food... Paradise Bakery really screwed their reputation by selling out to Panera ... VERY DISSATISFIED!!!"}
{"text":"Delivery driver botched the address and the order was missing a $30 item. Management provided a 20% discount to the order but wasn't overly apologetic. Surprising overall service from a usually reliable company. Other choices in the area to use in the future."}
{"text":"UPDATE:
Again we have problems. I have never had problems at Panera except for this location. This time I ordered a chicken avocado melt and when I got home I discovered that there was no avocado. When I called to ask if they had avocado in stock, which sometimes they don't and they don't tell you, the manager said yes we have avocado. I ask why there is no avocado on my avocado sandwich and he could not give an answer and simply said that he was going to work with his team. To make sure that they get the orders correct. This is the third issue I've had at this location and honestly I won't be coming back. I'll drive a little bit further to Ballantyne, where at least I know I'll get what I order. When you pay $20 for two sandwiches you expect quality. 

LIERS. Never in my life have I been disappointed by a Panera Bread until last night. Mr girlfriend ordered a 11$ Pick Two to go. But when we got her dinner, it felt light. Well we opened it up and the sandwich was tiny. I know it is half a sandwich, but this was literally a quarter. She ordered a Turkey and Avocado sandwich. First of all there was no avocado, and the guy behind the counter told us they were out. Why didn't anyone tell us about this when we ordered? Then we asked about the size and he claimed that their bread maker makes small sourdough loafs. This was all BS because when I got my panini, it was 3x the size of her sandwich. She gets that sandwich all the time and it has never been that small. The guy behind the counter did not offer to correct the sandwich and when you compare it to my sandwich, it is clearly a rip off. 11$ for a TINY sandwich and some soup is a clear rip off. Like I said, I go to panera a lot and I have never been disappointed till last night. Check out the photos to see what I am talking about."}
{"text":"I had chicken noodle soup and chicken avocado melt for pick 2 deal (half & half) and I really enjoyed them. The staffs were helpful and kind and I would definitely come here again for my breakfast."}
{"text":"This is a great place for salads and sandwiches, not to forget their amazing cookies. The wifey and I enjoy coming here for a cheap meal while enjoying our local eateries."}
{"text":"Great and the staff is always friendly! So much better than before! The coffee at this place is amazing and the food always comes out very quick and tastes delicious!"}
{"text":"BEST COOKIES EVER ! Chompies has nothing on paradise's cookies and baked goods . So good my siblings have me bringing them cookies from Arizona to California . The one and only thing i will miss in Arizona is going to be paradise bakery ."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out and the food was good.  The service wasn't overly friendly and the take out portion sizes seemed very small.  We ordered salads and soups.  The time to get our order was very slow.

The restaurant was also not very clean, the floors had lots of crumbs and many tables were not clean.

Also, we didn't get the type of bread we ordered."}
{"text":"I like Panera for an occasional breakfast treat once in a while, I prefer their breakfast options over the other many chains (McDonalds, Chik - Fil-A, etc.).
My first impression of this location was not Welcoming. The place had NO CUSTOMERS at 7am which isn't a issue however considering that it was only me and two employees (one behind the pastries and the other looking in a book or schedule standing behind the register) I'm not sure why I wasn't greeted when I entered or asked \"How may I help you\" once I stood at the beginning of the line (where the separators were set). I knew what I wanted and had to say \"Good Morning, on ready to order\" in order to be invited to the register to order. 
As I waited for my Egg White sandwich I sat facing the screen where my name appeared (I have a Panera reward card) under the Being Prepared column, the manager who took my order began to discuss with the employee who was standing behind the pastries the inconsistency and attitude of another employee who was late. They spoke foul of this employee and loud because I AS A CUSTOMER was NOBODY so my presence didn't matter I guess. 
In the 7minutes I was in the restaurant I learned how a employee didn't pay attention enough is was always LATE & even heard a guy from the kitchen YELL at the manager and the staff person yelled at him for yelling at her ( Yes back and forth and round and round LOL).
The only reasons this place got 2 stars is because 1) I LOVE the breakfast from Panera and it was a good sandwich from this location. 2) The kitchen guy brought my sandwich to me and o didn't have to get up.

This was my first visit, I don't live in the area and have no business in the area after today so chances are I'll NEVER return."}
{"text":"The cashiers seem like you're inconveniencing them, the counters were dirty and many tables had crumbs and was not clean.  The bathroom had no soap. And they ran out of milk, half n half, and had only slim milk for coffee at noon on a Saturday. The dispenser was sticky and nobody seemed to care.  Please panera, come fix this place. The wifi doesn't work. Mgt needs to evaluate how badly managed this place us"}
{"text":"I am normally a big fan of Panera for lunch, but this location seems a bit overwhelmed at lunch time. I ordered lunch online because the line was out of the door. 

I normally get the southwest lime chicken salad, but this was out of stock. This, alongside the majority of the salads on the menu had some ingredients out of stock, which made them not able to ordered! Once I ordered my something else via the app, it was done by the estimated time (8 minutes after ordering), despite the crazy amount of people waiting for their orders. But overall I was disappointed in the availability of foods on the regular menu."}
{"text":"We eat here often and this is the first time I have seen it so messy. There food on the floor in front of the garbage cans, lots of dirty dishes in the bin, garbage on the floor in the women's bathroom and many dirty tables. There are hardly any customers in here at all and well past the lunch rush. (It's 4pm) we didn't even get greeted when we came in although the other two groups of people did. Kinda disappointed with this location right now."}
{"text":"I was told to get back into line, a very long one after buying our bagels, which were cold after waiting 20 mins to get cream cheese. Why not just give me one? I would of paid for it. The cashier actually laughed at me and the manager was irritated by me.
Was that too much to ask for? I also have a disability which made standing an challenge. No one cared. Won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Came here two days in a row & both times the ice tea was watered down, 90% of the bagels were gone by 0930, service was cordial at best. Paradise rewards cards were declined even though there's a big sign in the kitchen that says Paradise Bakery & Cafe and it's the same company. Needless to say, I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice and both times they did not give me my complete order. I will not go back to this location. They did not even apologize when I brought it up to the cashier!"}
{"text":"I live right between 2 paneras and this location is probably the best for parking.  That is a big criteria since panera is a popular meeting place or place to go if you want to get lunch and enjoy some alone time to read or use the internet away from your apartment.  The big downside to this location is that it often is tough to find a spot to sit and an outlet for your computer.  Another downside is that the Mineral Point location feels like a senior center.  It's not unusual to see multiple groups of senior citizens camping out at tables near outlets for over an hour at a time.  The staff doesn't want to ask them to move to another spot freeing up a spot for someone else to sit and enjoy lunch or get some work done.  

The food, especially the breakfast food is good.  Coffee is better than Starbucks.  Prices have gone up quite a bit, so eating there is an occasional treat now, thus the complaint about the senior campers.  If I'm going to eat out and spend almost $10 on lunch, I want to have a nice spot to sit, not have to hunt for an open spot."}
{"text":"I like paneras food (although it's nothing spectacular) because it reminds me of a good homemade meal. They have really good smoothies but the prices for the sandwiches are SO expensive. On average, I spend 18$ for lunch which is a lot. I got a steak and cheese panini (in photo) and it cost me $8..for HALF size. I don't know that I can justify this cost because it's so much for a tiny sandwich. It tasted good but it's not 8$ good."}
{"text":"It's a nice cozy coffee place with a lot of seats.
Unfortunately the food is not very good. Nothing to write home about and certainly not worth the money. It's fresher than Tim Hortons but I actually prefer the flavours at Tims. I found the cookies to be too sweet and the croissants were cold and not very buttery.
But what really had me disappointed was the cleanliness. The bathrooms looked like they had not been cleaned in awhile... I won't go into details. Maybe I just went on an off day but they say that bathrooms tell you a lot about a restaurant and these bathrooms were enough to make me never want to return."}
{"text":"(Sigh) people of Arizona, why do you continue to annoy me with your shitty and illegal parking jobs? It was 1:30pm. I thought since it was after the \"peak\" lunch hour I would be safe. All I wanted to do was get a tuna sandwich TO GO and I ended up being nearly blocked into that tiny, narrow parking lot due to all you old fogies plowing into any space you can because you had a hankerin' for some chippers. 
While there I witnessed a car illegally parked in the handicapped parking space, one parked in the \"to-go\" parking spot (obviously NOT getting to-go) and some asshole next to me who made the most comically bad attempt at parking I have ever seen (I took pictures, see my profile). 
I waited in the long line, finally got my sandwich and decided to eat outside so I could see what the idiot looked like. Well the person was either as old as Arizona and still trying to chew their food or an employee. I I got tired of waiting and was finally able to leave. 
And they put tomatoes on my sandwich after I told them not to!
So moral of the story is; avoid this location anytime around lunch. And if you see an 80's era Mercedes Benz station wagon you have my permission to piss in the gas tank."}
{"text":"I tried their mac and cheese, the price was really expensive for the portion I was given. But, I will be honest that it was fantastic. I'd definitely go back if they increase their portion sizes. The place is usually jam packed so most of the times a take-out is your only option."}
{"text":"For being a chain they have really tasty and fresh food. Although being a little salty, the Italian combo is a very light and flavorful sandwich. I like to do the \"You Pick Two\" and get a 1/2 sandwich with a soup. The lemon chicken something soup is really tasty & it's always a treat when they have their tortilla soup. One thing great about this location is the service. They are always happy, welcoming and a pleasure to order from."}
{"text":"This was a bad experience spoiler alert! It's not often had I go to Panera however this time was not a great one. I'm on the road on business and I took the risk of spending the extra money. They were out of bread bowls! Their soda machines was half out. It's embarrassing to run out of product. It's very disapointing when I can't order my favorite item. Thanks Panera, for the one disapointing meal I had in Champaign illinois."}
{"text":"I like that it's so big inside, there are lots of seats, and it's pretty clean.

But they don't seem to understand how the Rapid Pick-up shelf works.  There have been several times, where I order something and they never put it on the shelf.  Then after waiting I have to talk to a person at the register and show them my order on my phone and they say \"oh we never got it\" and I have to wait even longer to get the order.  It defeats the purpose of \"Rapid pick-up\".  This is never a problem at the other Paneras."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to read bad reviews for this Panera. From the times my husband and I have come here, we've received great service and the food is up-to-par, better than the ones I've been to in Colorado Springs. We just picked up our food and drinks there (I ordered online for Rapid Pickup), and the service there today takes the cake. When we picked it up, the free birthday pastry that I got from my free rewards from Panera was not available ( I ordered the cherry pastry), but a note was left on the receipt saying \" Sorry out... See manager.\" After my husband and I got ready to go to the manager, she immediately came to us and apologized for the unavailable pastry and asked me what other pastry I would like. Barbara, the manager, walked with me to the pastry area and I selected another pastry. I was disappointed that they did not have the cherry pastry (which I assume must taste so good that they ran out quickly), but the outstanding service by Barbara made me and my husband leave happy from Panera with another delicious pastry - cinnamon roll! Definitely going back, and the food we ordered was delicious! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken walnut half sandwich, a side salad, and a green booster smoothie. Ann, a Paradise Bakery employee who checked me out had the worst attitude ever. I was pretty excited about my meal but after she rang me up, I never wanted to come back to that location to receive service from anyone there. The sandwich was good, but the salad could've been better. Also, the photo on the menu screen of the green booster smoothie looked huge, but once they brought it out to me it was in a half cup for the price of about $5. Seriously? Not coming back."}
{"text":"I must admit - Paradise is a gem. I purposefully forget how good this place is because I sometimes disdain $10+ lunches, but when I go I always think it's worth it. Turkey & Cranberry sandwich is one of my absolute favorites of all time. SW Caesar Salad (add the corn salsa) is also very high on my favorite salad list. This location is always clean, and friendly. Convenient access to the highway (and my office) means I should go more often as should you. Wish they included a drink with some sort of lunch special under $10... In my dreams!"}
{"text":"For 4 people, a sandwich and a soup and a drink each it was 70$ so over priced, not great either. It's very mediocre food. Will not be back. Go to Olive Garden and get sit down service WITH tip included."}
{"text":"I can't say I wasn't warned. ..
The half fuji chicken salad was a puny portion of maybe a .5c of white (not green) lettuce... so small it took half of my small container. How do you jip on the freaking lettuce is beyond me but at least the toppings were proportional to a half salad. 
My chicken chipotle panini was chewy bread, about the thickness of a credit card. . Maybe trying to heat up the cheese quickly so use of the thinnest, chewy bread?..? The panini had at least decent flavor combinations. 
The cashier was very nice. .. the place looks nice. 
Definitely feel like they're making Paradise Bakery look bad. ..i wasn't in love with Paradise but at least they were decent on salad portions and ratios. 

Bummer... close to my hood but not likely part of my repertoire."}
{"text":"This is pretty much like a paradise bakery.. The girl that was working at the counter aid that Panera actually biugh Paradise bakery and that there would be no more PAradise in Phoenix in 2016... Interesting

Anyways they do have a similar menu. I got the you pick 2: chicken ceasar salad (taste exactly like paradise bakery) and chicken chipotle panini (this one is actually better!)

But no free cookie :( you get a choice of kettle chips, dinner roll, baked chips, and apple...

Gonna miss thise free cookies!"}
{"text":"Staff at the counter was unfriendly. Jessica looked like she did not want to be working. No greet or anything. It was a great experience when it was Paradise."}
{"text":"Panera has been a consistent chain in my life.  This location in the District has a constant stream of customers.  They do a good job of keeping tables clean and cleared for the next guest.  The service has been polite and helpful.  They also make it easy to call in or order from the app.  

The Panera menu updates just like many other chains.  Pick two is still available for your choice of soup, salad or sandwich.  The menu boards show the calories for each size item.  That is always helpful! I have always enjoyed their various salads.  Recently I tried the BBQ chicken salad.  Yum! The sauce has a great smokey flavor.  There is plenty of grilled chicken with corn and fried onions.  It's surely a winner! 

If you sign up for the free Panera card, you get a free treat in your birthday.  During the year they will also load coupons or specials.  Thanks Panera!"}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, I was disappointed when I rolled into Dana park and saw that Paradise is now Panera. Decided I'd give it a shot anyway. The interior of the place has changed, they don't utilize the whole bar, and I couldn't tell if it was just being blocked off or under construction...it made the ordering/cashier area seem more cramped. I was also unsure of how the restaurant actually operates for dine-in customers. I had ordered to go, but unless the several customers behind me were all take out as well, I don't know what everyone was doing. There's only a two-person bench for people to wait on to-go orders, so there was quite a crowd of people standing near the registers and in between the soft drink station waiting for their food, again making it cramped. Also, it was unfortunate that their ice machine wasn't working, they had a large bucket with a scooper...it looked clean but I don't trust everyone else's hands especially since it wasn't a scoop with a long handle. 

I thought it was pretty cool how your name appears on a screen to show you if your order is next/being prepared. Probably helps the employees as well, as they probably don't get as many questions on \"when's my food coming out\"; you see exactly where you are in the mix. Regardless, the woman who was quality checking orders kindly asked me if I saw my name on the screen, and I did, which I appreciate because she was ensuring that I was being taken care of. I came in during a rush and it's good to see someone staying on top of the orders, especially since they seemed to have a few employees in training. Quality checking is so important because there is nothing worse than getting home to find you're missing an item. The same friendly woman (didn't catch her name but she had pretty tattoos ), received my bags of food, and thoroughly checked through them, even moving a few items around to make sure everything matched the ticket. 

When I got home with all the food, my other half and I enjoyed the chicken walnut sandwich (delicious) and french onion soup. The French onion soup was tasty, however, I was confused by the cheese sprinkles at the bottom. Looked like I got the the very last crumbs from a bag of shredded cheese, and it looked like American cheese. The mac and cheese - BOMB. On point and so creamy, would highly recommend for a small side or for kids. 

Mostly a good experience, perhaps when they are more established in the area and people get over the company switch, this place will get even better with time. 5 stars for customer service."}
{"text":"I really like this location! My food is always great. Service is good, usually very fast. I love their tomato soup. Really yummy. They also started offering a low fat soup that I can't wait to try. I love the paninis. And the italian sandwich... HUGE! and filled with yummy goodness. Pair that with the tomato soup and mmmmm. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. 

Salad: The santa fe salad is yum! The dressing is a little spicy. The kick is kind of a good surprise. They gladly add other toppings if you ask like tomato, onion, etc. I have had some locations get snooty about this but never this location. 

I recently had breakfast here and the oatmeal was really good. Fresh fruit on top, really good. 

Now about those cream cheese brownies! Wow! My favorite brownies ever. I will say the chocolate chip cookies are hit or miss. Some days they are fresh and gooey and some days hard and crunchy. You just never know! I am glad that they always let you substitute another kind of cookie with your meal."}
{"text":"New staff and locale? Its road food. I got something unlike what I ordered but I was a mile down the road before I unwrapped it and found out."}
{"text":"$7.27 for the tom mozz panini.  now, in my experience tom mozz sandwich are usually served with fresh tom and fresh mozz.  not the case here.  it was pretty bad.  2 very teeny tiny slices of tom on the sandwich with melted mozz cheese on toasted bread with some other ingredient  (canned toms?) served warm.  not even close to my idea of a fresh tasting tom mozz sandwich.  also came w a bag of chips (best part about the meal).  the place was packed!  i think it's considered one of monroeville's finest lunch spots??!!  straight up."}
{"text":"The BBQ Chicken Salad is good and very healthy! The service is good. There are lots of seats in the 2nd floor."}
{"text":"We were regular Sunday breakfast guests.  Last 6 months service has gone down hill.  Workers are not properly trained, unfriendly and pace of work is slow.  Lately they have been running out of bagels and now they only serve plain cream cheese.  Soup and sandwich not available consistently and lately not at all before 11am.  My recommendation is to bring in new management to turn a once great location around.  Today is my last visit after being a loyal Sunday customer for over 5 years."}
{"text":"My wife ordered (online) chicken noodle soup and a whole baguette, and a Greek salad for me.

My meal should have come with bread... but they left it out.  The Greek salad was awful. Almost no olives and almost no feta. And the left out all the bread.

I went back... for the bread and they still shortchanged us... the one piece that should have come with my terrible Greek salad.  The manager apologized without even looking at me.

Terrible place. They simply seem not to care.  The manager was the one who looked at the online order and still got it wrong. 

If you go there best to check every item before leaving.  Lots of other alternatives. Panera... are you listening?"}
{"text":"Had the absolute best cinnamon roll ever in this Panera. So fresh and delicious. Good job!"}
{"text":"If you have been to Panera, then you know what to expect here too. The staff were not very friendly or very knowledgeable about their products. We asked what one item was and she gave a very vague description. Then she forgot what I had ordered which was a drink and a raspberry almond thumbprint cookie. The cookie was fine, but with so many options in the district I would probably just find a little snack somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"So overpriced for a mediocre cold cut sandwich the size of my fist... 
Wouldn't come again."}
{"text":"What's with the new bistro French onion soup? I liked the old soup better. Too many onions, not enough cheese, and lack of flavor in this one. Ham and Swiss sandwich was solid though."}
{"text":"Poor attention to detail here. Asked what was on the Italian sandwich, specifically said no mayo or mustard. Instead of following the order, the preparer put both on and giardiniera that wasn't mentioned and I didn't want. Unfortunately I was with a business group and didn't check my sandwich until I was in the car and couldn't return for a remake and make everyone wait on me. Now I have a $14.50 sandwich I can't eat, and gave a tip I apparently shouldn't have."}
{"text":"I love their desserts, specially their cookies and their coffee is good. Service is decent. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I love Panera bread! Although the staff at this location has changed quite a bit, it is still one of my go to places for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I have been to this Panera many times because it is close by. I like that. The service is freindley and awesome . The bread is always fresh and delicious.  I am so glad they came to Parma. I always leave happy. I have to recommend this location because it is always fresh and they always have extra loaves. Happy customer."}
{"text":"Here for a trade show and looking for a quick, good breakfast to start the day. Food was good, as is typical of Panera, but the service was beyond great! Friendly, helpful and just plain nice, glad to spend my money in such a pleasant atmosphere! We'll be back tomorrow morning for sure and the tip will be lots bigger!!"}
{"text":"Usually I have good experiences coming here expect for two times I came here. The first my plates for my Mac and cheese were dirty, then today I ordered through the drive through and my bread was very hard seemed like it's been sitting out or something. It hurt to bite into which is a problem. The lady at the window didn't even give me the option to pick between chips or bread and I usually get chips. Not too happy with this experience."}
{"text":"Just stopped by here for coffee.  Nobody at the register, then half way through the transaction (remember, it was just coffee), the cashier left and got someone else to handle a non-existent problem.  Won't be back here."}
{"text":"Crappiest croissant I've eaten from a place that proud itself a bakery. It looks like something I would messed up in my kitchen."}
{"text":"My favorite item from Panera is their Mac n Cheese! 

Today I decided to try their newer menu items because they've added quite a few! 
I had a \"You Choose Two\" - you select two of either soup, sandwich, pasta, or salad. 

I got Chicken Sorrentina Pasta & Baked Potato Soup
* equal amounts of pasta, chicken and spinach ; sauce is good ; pasta may have been a little overcooked today though
* great baked potato soup!

Coworker also had a \"You Choose Two\" - Tortellini Alfredo & Broccoli Cheddar Soup

Overall good place to have a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"This location has the worst customer service and I think my recent visit was the worst experience I have had here. I visited on April 9th and the lady who waited on us was visibly mad to be serving us. The more items we ordered the angrier she got, a total of 4 items. By the end of our order she was yelling and she threw the cinnamon roll we ordered in a bag and tossed it on the counter towards us, our order was not to go.I think Panera needs to focus on how they treat customers, won't be visiting this location again anytime soon but being a large chain I'm sure they don't care."}
{"text":"AMAZING, KIND, RESOURCEFUL people making wonderful fresh food. I had lunch here today, left my purse with $150 cash, license and credit card. Caitlin and her beautiful staff held it for me, found me on Facebook and I got EVERYTHING back. 
Thank you thank you thank you! 
I will forever be a loyal and appreciative patron!"}
{"text":"Panera Bread is a tad on the pricey side.  I know people who refuse to go because the price of the meal does not match the proportion.

My solution is to pay more so that the two price versus proportion eventually meet in the middle somewhere.

Is there anything finer than dipping a butter coated piece of French baguette into a bowl of French onion soup?  Yes, I know there is but this is indeed tasty.

PB seems to always be busy with people ordering and people eating but the staff never loose their cool.  Everyone from the worker behind the counter to manager are always so damn pleasant and full of smiles."}
{"text":"Another average branch in a very busy area of Shadyside on Baum. The quality of the food is still good, the staff are nice, but I did notice that the restaurant is not as kept as the location in Oakland. There were dirty and disheveled tables, overflowing trashcans, and the floor was littered with food crumbs and napkins. They should have at least one employee designated for the upkeep of the dining area, as with the Oakland branch. I stopped in around 3:30 in the afternoon at a very unbusy time, so there was no reason why the dining area wouldn't look its best. Nevertheless, I would still stop in again sometime."}
{"text":"Before I can open my mouth to order, the cashier goes \"don't tell me you're going to order macaroni in the bread bowl\". What kind of customer service is this? \"Uh, no\". \"Okay good\". Uhhm excuse me? Customer service was non-existent, I wanted to just say something right there or just walk back out, but I was in such shock and so hungry. I ended up ordering the cranberry chicken flatbread and onion soup. Flatbread was burnt, onion soup didn't come with cheese or croutons. Employees need to be retrained. I'd much rather go to zupas next time."}
{"text":"I usually love Panera, but this was not a good trip. (I work at a different location so I might have a higher standard) While service was fast, the coffee had a lot of grounds in it. I asked for another pot which they made, but still the same problem. I didn't ask again, I wasn't sure they understood the problem at that point. Oh well-ok coffee and soup for 6.50 though? It just makes me happy I usually have a discount."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Panera bread - it's just great to know that the food served is fresh(almost) and hot and yet it is quick ! It is higher on the price though.
I would pretty much rate all Panera bread stores the same - they are neat, quick and have plenty of seating Incase you want to eat in . 
Coming to the food - the breakfast sandwich that I tried today was the avacado, spinach and egg white in a Seeded multigrain bun . It was filling with a generous helping of spinach and the egg white was much bigger than the bun! It's 5 bucks for a bfast sandwich but then it is much bigger than what you get at other comparable stores .
Been to the McMurray store a number of times - there have been small issues at times but then it can never be Always Perfect! 
Keep dishing out good food Panera bread !"}
{"text":"Eh. It was alright. Some stuff was good - kids meals are garbage. Grilled cheese comes on a microwaveable plate that you can tell they didn't even put on a range. Not fresh. Cookies are extra. Serving sizes have been decreased, costs have gone up. They food was better than fast food so there's a plus."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to grab lunch with friends who I haven't seen in a while. I love love love their broccoli cheddar soup along with a baguette and their hazelnut coffee."}
{"text":"I have been disappointed in Panera in the past but thought I would give it another try. It was terrible. The Tuna on toast was heated like a panini and the tuna ran out of the bread when you picked it up. I returned it and the manager nicely said he would have another one made and toast the bread first. It still had runny, messy tuna.  The apple that came with the lunch was old and tasteless. Overall a big Zero!"}
{"text":"Came here at 11 :50am, first I tried to order broccoli Cheddar with bread bowl but they did not have any bread bowls in stock. Next, I ordered salmon club, 5 min after I sat down they came and told me they did not have any croissant bread left. I ended up choosing white bread because getting a refund would be too much trouble. Food tasted ok, don't think it's worth $10 though maybe ill try the Panera at Golden gate plaza or the Qdoba next door next time.

Place looked clean, had a nice atmosphere . The cashier told me have a goodnight when it's clearly 11:56:32 am."}
{"text":"I have been to Panera Bread several times and the experience is the same. Delicious food but the service sucks. Cookies are good. The workers and manager don't look happy."}
{"text":"I have eaten at a couple of different Panera's over the last few years.  I prefer the old Paradise Bakery model a lot more.  We stopped by here after a long week of events.  I ordered a ham and swiss sandwich, side of mac and cheese and a lemonade.  The food was good.  

The layout in this location is strange.  There are kiosks where you can order the food your self.  Then there are cubby holes I guess for you food when it is completed. There are cashiers too. I spent a few seconds looking for the lemonades.  I went to where I thought they would be located, but was wrong.  Had to walk to what felt like the end of the line.  

I had to think of a way to sum this place up.  The food is okay.  This location comes across too superfluous and over thought.  It reminds me of the movie Rising Sun.  They had a plot and they tried way to hard to make the movie intriguing by adding unnecessary twist.  They could have made the movie simpler and accomplished the same task.  They could have made this place with a simpler layout and be more comfortable."}
{"text":"I hate to give this review, but I will.  I have stopped by this location on two separate occasions.  I will never go back.  I stopped by here on these two occasions because they were pretty much only thing open."}
{"text":"The food is good.  Like the other location in downtown Phoenix.  I do not understand the layout of this place.  Maybe there are some demographics showing this is the next new thing.  I would not like this place if I had small children that moved around a lot.  They can easily get out of your field of view quickly.  

I had a ham and swiss sandwich minus tomatoes.  Small mac and cheese for a side.  The food is good when options are limited.  

This place was just convenient since we left the movie theater a few minutes earlier.  If I was not in a hurry to go home we would have passed on this place.  Plus they have two restrooms and they are always in use.  I went into the men's restroom this trip and a young woman was in there washing her hands because the women's was in use with a few people waiting."}
{"text":"Horrible service, constantly making mistakes, orders not coming out properly, and just dumb things like \"running out of\" certain food AFTER you've ordered it and they then come to your table to inform you.

Also, there food is simply nothing special to write home about, small portions, high price.

I basically go here because it's close by, if it wasn't for location, they would have nothing."}
{"text":"I know I can be on the cynical side if customer service people are incompetent or rude. However, the Panera Bread locations in Ohio are very nice. I wish we could import their employees to Maryland. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"I was in your store this morning, 3/17 and wanted to order breakfast.  I had just picked my dog up and did not want to leave him in the car, as it gets very hot very quick.  I was told by the manager that only service dogs are allowed in the restaurant, which I completely understand.  I had asked her, the manager, who was EXTREMELY rude and unprofessional, if she could take my order outside so I do not disrupt business.  She proceeded to tell me no and that me having my 12 pound dog prevented me from being able to order or purchase anything.  At this point, I was genuinely almost BEGGING her to \"let\" me spend my money at her business and she was refusing.  I truly understand the no dog policy and that is not my issue or concern.  It was her complete lack of respect for a PAYING customer and how incredibly rude she was towards me.  I hope that she does not treat your employees this way, as I can only imagine what type of moral this restaurant would have. I will make sure to tell everyone, on every platform I can, how disgusting she treated me and not to spend their hard earned money on a place that A. doesn't deserve it, B. are overpriced anyways and C. clearly doesn't care. I'm impressed (and deplored at the same time) that this business is doing so well that not only can they turn away customers, they can do it in the most grossly unprofessional and ill-mannered way possible. Your competition now surpasses you in every aspect and after this atrocious incident I will gladly pass 100 Paradise Bakeries (especially the one at Norterra) on my way to any one of your competitors to avoid ever being treated like this again."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed going to Panera for a quick breakfast but today I was disappointed. I ordered my food online as I was in a hurry, and I received half of a strawberry parfait that I ordered, complimented with a knife (not a spoon), and three spinach leaves when I ordered extra spinach leaves in my sandwich, and rotten pieces of avocado. 

To the workers there, please don't take your frustration out on customers just because you can. The service at this location is consistently bad as compared to many of the other Panera locations I've been to."}
{"text":"Im so not a bread or sandwich person, so how I ended up here it's a secret!  Literally!!  I read about the secret aka the \"Hidden Menu\" for some healthier choices of low carb/high protein options like the Chicken Hummus Bowl and Steak Lettuce Wraps.  Sounds good to me! 

Since it's not on the menu board or mentioned in any advertising you have to let the cashier know you want to order from the \"Hidden Menu\" 

menu deets here: http://mypanera.panerabread.com/articlestips/article/access-into-paneras-hidden-menu/

The Steak Lettuce Wraps I tried were surprisingly very good.  The steak was very lean, prior grilled served chilled, sliced thin strips, not processed didnt have that taste like it was treated with sodium nitrates. The fresh veggies that came with it were sliced cucumbers and onions and diced tomatoes.  All the ingredients were topped with a basil pesto and tossed with lemon juice.  The pesto was a really refreshing touch to this dish.  I would so order this for lunch again!  

Restaurant was fairly clean although some of the tables needed to be bussed more thoroughly.  I passed up the booths that had bits of food debris (ie lettuce and crumbs) on the seats.  Service was pretty good. The cashier at the counter was knowledgeable, it's a good sign they knew what is offered on the Hidden Menu. Good thing it's available at all Panera's now. So based on only what I tried this visit it's a 3.7 ....Like I said I don't come here for the breads or sandwiches but I really like that they now offer low carb selections.   Next time I want to try the egg white bowl with roasted turkey that's on the breakfast hidden menu."}
{"text":"A great place to get health soups, salads and sandwiches!  Tried the soup in a bowl-light bread with a crisp and shiny crust filled with New England Clam Chowder! It was delicious!!Very busy when I arrived but only had to wait 5 minutes or so to pick up my take out order.  Staff are so helpful if you have diet restrictions and quickly respond to your questions."}
{"text":"The worst Panera experience ever! First my girlfriend gets a pumpkin latte and takes a zip and it is so ungodly hot that it burned her mouth. Granted we are people who normally drink hot coffee, but this was lava! Then I go to the cashiers with a sense of urgency and let them know so I can get some ice and calm her now swelling mouth! They took 23 min, that's right I time them! To get me another latte and had absolutely no urgency for getting me some ice, to the point where I stole their drink cups and hurried to the ice machine and got some ice! You have now lost my business Panera!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service by female server.   Rolling of eyes totally uncalled for.  The manager was nice and fixedd the problem. But the server made it seem like such a huge deal."}
{"text":"Horrible service. They do not care or value the customer whatsoever... makes me sad I live literally 2.4 miles away on the same street as the location but they said they won't deliver to me.. and there is no Panera bread location in the entire state of Arizona that delivers to me... even tho I've had Panera deliver to me before over the phone. Odd. I really like eating at Panera, too bad they don't care about the customer. I tell everyone I know to never go here. Or any Panera for that matter"}
{"text":"The place besides a library where I can find wi-fi in Ohio. When I visit my family and need high-speed internet access, this is the place. I love the food too. They have some of the best sandwichs, soups and pastries."}
{"text":"I had NO idea this Panera was even open. We parked in the back (by the Boca valet area) and wondered why the entrance wasn't marked very well, turns out their is a lovely grand entrance in the front. 

The guy taking our order was very pleasant, he suckered us into adding a desert for $.99 (well, it wasn't really suckering, I never say no to sweets!). The store was clean, the food (Frontega Chicken & Caesar Salad) was great, as it always is with Panera. My husband ordered the pasta Bolognese, the smaller portion, and smaller it was. It wasn't very fulfilling for the price, but it was still good. 

Overall $25 for two meals, two drinks and dessert is a bit steep when we can spend the same amount and get more food elsewhere. But I am glad to see another Panera in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I tried to go but the line was to the door and one clerk working the register. I waited a bit but the line didn't move. I guess they need more staff and a better system to corral guests waiting in line. You can't let it be a free zone for guests to figure it out unfortunately.

I do like their cinnamon crunch bagels. Very good bagel with the hazelnut cream cheese. I wish they made cappuccinos. You can only get lattes. It's like a giant cup of hot milk and no foam and no espresso."}
{"text":"I love love love panera. I haven't tried much of their menu, I'm a regular to the BBQ chicken salad! It's so delicious, always fresh. Who would have thought cold bbq sauce was so good. I always enjoy it with a tea and a side of bread. They also have a great bottle strawberry drink you must try if you wanna go for something with a little bit of tang!"}
{"text":"Panera bread is a great company, but this wasn't the best example. I called in an order (yes 2002 style called) because I was on the highway and didn't want to use the app. Took longer then I expected to pick up and when the lady did she sounded rush and put me on a hold. When she came back I placed my order and was told 5 minutes. 

I'm thinking great and I was there in 6 minutes.

Saw a coffee cup and water cups just sitting on an outside table dirty, just the little things getting lost in the cracks. As you go in Panera if you have a pick-up you can usually just grab it from the box and go. 

My order was not there.

So the food runner or table walk by girl was there an I asked if they had an order for me, she said hold on and asked the chefs. \"Never got a ticket\" was the response I overheard.

In NO WAY was the cook to blame for that statement, the company's policy is: no ticket, no taco. 

Here's where the lady manager steps in and says yeah I'll be right with you. Takes her time to walk thru the back to make sure my order is started, then tell me it's a communication issue and sorry. Offers me my drinks and I tell her to just keep them with my food so I can step outside to smoke. Come back in and then got my order from one of the runner/table girls. Then as I get my drinks I watch the girls just stand there and talk while the drink station needed a clean and refill. As I walked out the door after about 8-12 minutes of my first encounter with this Panera location the coffee cup and water cups where still there. 

Standards and organization have been lost here, specifically with job detailed schedule. Now I'm just a senior in college studying business but I know the importance of having side jobs for employees to complete when there is not an influx of customer service. 
It's not that they were understaffed, just unmotivated employees. Which leaves the manager trying to pick up the pieces! No wonder she said a communication issue, duhh because your employees are running the circus!!!!!! In no way did I mean to make that sound rude. Just the actions that I saw in front of me today. Oh and the five to six bad reviews in the last 7 months."}
{"text":"Guy taking orders was less than personable or knowledgeable. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese to eat in. Got it 15 min buyers later,  cold,  in a bag. Pretty disappoining!"}
{"text":"Panera is one of my favorite places! Lunch or dinner I'm always a fan! 

Today I stopped in to try the new Avocado Cobb Salad. I'm a huge fan of avocado so I really had high hopes for this one! The salad is made with made with all-natural, antibiotic-free chicken, romaine, tomatoes, Applewood-smoked bacon, Gorgonzola, and hard-boiled eggs, all tossed with our herb vinaigrette, then topped with fresh avocado.

I really enjoyed the dressing, it was tangy and didn't overpower the salad but I was very disappointed with the avocado. It was like they took it and just threw a lump on top of the salad. I expected for it to at least me cut up into smaller pieces...oh well! The chicken was delicious and perfectly seasoned, so would I get it again yet...but with the avocado on the side. I could a used a bit more bacon...but I'm a total bacon lover so it would a been fine for anyone else, I'm sure! 

I also treated myself to a frozen mango smoothie...mango smoothie with raspberry syrup and whipped cream...a little over priced in my opinion at $3.99 but totally worth it...creamy and delicious! 

I'm a huge Panera fan and this place is in a great location...Walmart, Lowes, Bilo and Sweet Frogs are in the same parking lot so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"For this place to be in such a prime location I was surprised how easy my entire experience was! 

I decided to order from my lunch from the Panera app. The ordering process was easy all my special requests were fulfilled correctly. I went with the Pick 2 and chose the Italian Combo and Cobb salad with chicken and avocado. Both were delicious...as usual! And not to mention that the customer service here was great! Everyone I encountered during my visit was extremely polite and accommodating.  

Sure, parking can be a bit of a pain, especially during their busy hours but if I'm out on this side of town again I can definitely see myself stopping in!"}
{"text":"Put an order in online.... the order was ready at the right time, Panera wasn't too busy... the manager \"double checked\" my order and it was wrong! My order was missing additional items I paid for and they are just glancing in the bag, not even checking all items. My co-worker and I ordered completely separate online and we found that the additions I paid for were on her salad! Neither salad had croutons on them and the lettuce was not good. We were excited that one opened nearby but will drive the extra distance to the Green Valley location from now on. I gave 2 stars because the girl who greets people was nice."}
{"text":"The food and drinks here are not too bad, but I wish that they had their drinks in a larger size."}
{"text":"I have just checked in here. I did not know that they have a Panera Bread in Westlake."}
{"text":"I miss Paradise.  I miss the free cookie.  Other than that, the transition seems to be going smoothly.  Nice renovation.  Food still good.  Good service."}
{"text":"Each time I go here, I very rarely have complaints. The service is quick, the food is good, and the employees are pleasant. This is one of my go-to places for a meeting, because I know it will be quick and provide ample space to meet. It can get pretty cramped in here, but it all depends on the day and time. There is a private room available in this Panera location."}
{"text":"They always get your order wrong and portion sizes are so small. Literally a rip off for what you pay for. I mean if I'm gonna pay 10$ for a sandwich I expect to have more than just a scoop of what I'm getting. We're all students here, we're hungry. Stop being cheap on portions. The other panera bread locations aren't like this at all. I don't understand why this particular location is. They also need to hire more employees during busy hours"}
{"text":"One person working the point of sale with a line out the door. customers became angry, few left,. sandwiches horrible, soup was just ok. pastries ok. ticket time over 25 minutes serving 3 people at $38. portions, stingy, Get with it Panera!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing because normally I like panera stores a lot but this one has very dirty restrooms and slow wifi :-("}
{"text":"Love their sandwiches and soups. Their mobile app is so easy to use and I enjoy their rewards for using the app. All that said, I would love to get home with what I ordered. Ham egg and cheese power sandwich, ah heck just leave off the egg. Avocado Egg white with spinach, They leave off the avocado, the title ingredient.  Not just today, This is the fourth weekend in a row that they have messed up my order and while waiting, another customer brought her sandwich in missing its egg. Imagine my surprise when I got home and they had left mine off as well. Yea I know shame on me for not checking it but the folks at the counter are supposedly checking it. Back to the app. There is no place on there to complain about an incorrect order. They are supposed to give you a treat if they get the order wrong but I am not driving 5 miles back to correct the order anyway so here I sit steaming a tad more than the avacadoless sandwich. It happened twice at two locations. That free Pecan Braid does sound delicious. They do have delivery, maybe they should bring me one with my avacado. By the way, I am writing this review under the Matthews Township location but the Indian Trail location was the culprit for two of my other slights. I am heading there now to leave this same review. Note to self, Open the boxes and check the sandwich, odds are I will get a free treat."}
{"text":"Love their sandwiches and soups. Their mobile app is so easy to use and I enjoy their rewards for using the app. All that said, I would love to get home with what I ordered.

{"text":"Horrible service and they don't make any order I've ever gotten from there right. How is it hard to make an over easy egg..."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend ! Service was good ! Ordered a salad and a soup! Everything was good until I found a grass hopper on my salad ! Was terrified ! They exchanged it but I couldn't eat it anymore!"}
{"text":"I tried one of the two new broth bowls Paradise is promoting.  The lentil quinoa bowl was just okay tasting and even with the egg prepared just right, I still wouldn't pay .......get this........$8.19 for it again!  Yikes!  When did Paradise Bakery move their prices into the table service level?  In my opinion, this smaller serving of a meal in their soup department does not warrant the price."}
{"text":"Oh no, they just told me that they are out of  non fat milk after I paid AND waited for my latte."}
{"text":"Panera has consistently delivered fresh food!  Even though the prices for my usual half salad/half sandwich deal has increased, I still love this combo! The custom of free cookies for dessert have disappeared at some locations, but nice-size portions, allowed substitutions and fresh ingredients keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I live across the street pretty much and love me some pb but hate the parking lot in that little strip and can't say I like this one the best the food at this one is just ok. Love the peach tea though could drink it all the time."}
{"text":"I completely agree with Roger S.! Although this is a chain restaurant, that's not the feeling you get when you step in. First off - the place is spotless. Everyone is genuinely friendly and helpful. The manager, Anaya, is always visible and talking with customers. The food is ALWAYS fresh and I have yet to try something I don't like (the California Turkey is my favorite!). As long as you're not expecting an ocean view and a French maître d', This place is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is your typical chain-bakery providing industrial style baked goods and some pseudo Euro bistro dishes. Their coffee is lousy. The only good things to report about this place is their south-facing outdoor seating area, which gives you a grand parking lot view, and their wait staff with an attitude."}
{"text":"Don't really know what the hype is about. The food is okay. I had the sandwich roasted beef and arugula and French onion soup. Everything seemed cold. Maybe it was the item that I ordered. But the place itself was busy. Seems to be pretty healthy which is probably why the sandwich tasted kind of bland. For healthy eaters yes this is a place to go. I don't recommend what I ordered and will give it a shot to get something else next time :)"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. We normally use their rapid food order and very frequently the order is wrong. Since we take the order to go there isn't much we can do about it in such a small time period for lunch. As frustrating as this is we still continue to order from Panera since it is one of the only places that has an online order app. and we can order in the morning and have it ready to pick up at lunch. I recommend the steak sandwich. It has good flavor and is filling."}
{"text":"I've gotten more orders with mistakes than correct orders. This is totally ridiculous. Totally incompetent workers most of the time."}
{"text":"I overheard a male manager and female employee making very rude and racist remarks about chinese culture. This sort of behavior is ignorant and unacceptable in any situation. I found it to be extremely offensive and refuse to visit this location ever again."}
{"text":"Service is terrible.

Incident #1

There was this lady in street clothes, probably the manager, at the counter. We walked up looking at the menus high up and we heard \"How are you?\" out loud. So, I said \"oh, how are you?\" She replied \" Oh, I was talking to them.\" pointing at the ladies by the front doors.

Incident #2

I was getting some cream for my Iced coffee and there was no half and half left. As I was shaking the pitcher of 1/2 and 1/2, a female worker was stocking napkins right next to me. She looked at me and I looked at her, and I shake the next pitcher, empty as well. She just kept doing her thing and looking at me without a word or an acknowledgment.

Incident #3 

As we were browsing for tables, there was a lot of tables around but very few clean ones. We had to settle for a cleaner table. Next, we spent 20 minutes there and never saw a worker cleaning tables."}
{"text":"Had to pick up my birthday treat, the chocolate brownie is my ultimate favourite pastry at panera.
Panera is my fav restaurant for \"fast food\".

I come here whenever I need a quick and healthy meal.  My kids love the broccoli and cheddar soup and mac and cheese.  Normally we order the Mediterranean veggie sandwich and salads.  I also enjoy the iced green tea. 
Will be coming back always!!!!"}
{"text":"Got the pick 2 deal. Mac and cheese and BBQ chicken flat bread. My mac and cheese was cold. I asked for BBQ sauce I waited 10 minutes... I never got it I had to ask again. The service is awful!! There is a blonde with long hair that has no personality whatsoever. I didn't catch her name...Food wasn't good either. All around bad experience and I won't be back."}
{"text":"I know different cultures have certain ways to greet people but this one was new for me. The employee gave me a perpetual armpit scratch. Let's just say I did not return the hello. However, I did start giving a big smile when I saw all the bagels. I'm glad these bagels did not have personalities like they did in the movie, 'Sausage Party.' That was plenty Orthodox Jew for one sitting; have you guys seen it?

Anyway back to me smiling, my friends say I'm a nice (and happy) guy, with a happy heart. I usually respond, how in the heck can you have a happy heart? Doesn't make any sense, then they quickly take back what they said about liking me. Sooo, I think Panera bread is cool and should have considered calling itself something else, like, 'bread' or 'bagel' or 'bagel land.' I'm being told by Yelp there's a yelposphere, and I'm immediately in a bad mood. I don't like puns, they're not punny.

Okay, I should start making sense now. I think Panera nails the importance of a nice restaurant. The quality of food, price, and the yelposphere are all on point. I frequent here often. Good chips. See ya guys."}
{"text":"I ordered a you-pick-two and was really grossed out by how old the salad was. Not only that, but my soup bowl was only half full, the silverware was dirty, and the service was unfriendly :("}
{"text":"Their food is always very good! I love their season salads with the strawberries in them. Wish they were always available. Broccoli cheese soup is my favorite.  Con: This place is always insanely busy."}
{"text":"Oh the doom of the technology age. After trying to order online it kept saying the daily soup was unavailable so I called a human at the restaurant and asked if they had the soup. I was told yes. I drove out of my way and went to the store. The line was long and took forever because only one human was taking orders and the computers in the restaurant also said the daily soup was unavailable. So I waited, and waited, and waited. Then the human at the front told me they did not have the soup! No money from me Panera. I'm out and won't be back.  Thank goodness for Bashas, now I have lunch. Live and learn."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots. It's super clean and staff is always friendly and quick to offer help. I came here a lot after I got my wisdom tooth pulled to indulge in their soups since my diet was limited. Only negative is that it is a little pricey. However, I get a good deal from time to time by using my Panera card."}
{"text":"I've waited a bit to write this review because for me this branch deserves a 3.5 star review; however, Yelp confines me to whole stars so I lean towards a 3. I've been here quite a few times for lunch and in between writing sessions in the library. It's always quite busy, particularly during semesters, and sometimes it's a bear to wait in line for a while. The quality of the food is always good, and the staff seem competent and friendly. I've been disappointed here a few times that the types of bagels I want are not available later in the afternoon. Sometimes, there are only a couple of types of bagels left as early as 3pm. I wish they had a variety of bagels available throughout the entire day rather than \"while supplies last.\" Overall, though, I enjoy this place and will continue to frequent. Their black bean soup is amazing."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is pretty cozy and casual, quite a few elderly patrons.

Food leaves something to be desired.  Had the cuban panini, it was OK, but nothing to brag about.

Guess it's OK as a place to come for coffee or meet friends, just don't expect to be blown away by the food."}
{"text":"My experience at this Panera was great. Unlike when I'm at the Forbes Avenue location, I didn't have to worry about parking or finding a table. This location has plenty of room. My Fuji apple salad and French onion soup were delicious as well as my favorite flip flop cookie! I will return here especially when I'm in a hurry."}
{"text":"Panera is great. But this one is bad. Constantly messing up orders. Tons of attitude from the \"cooks\". Long waits. No good."}
{"text":"I really like this particular Panera at The District.  It has a warmer ambience, food is fresher and a little more spacious."}
{"text":"I've tried Panera twice and was disappointed both times. The staff is unfriendly and slow to fill orders. The first time I went they got my order wrong and I didn't realize it until I was home. I decided to give them a second chance. They did get my order correct (I checked before driving off this time) but it took them nearly 15 mins to get my food to me in the drive thru with only one customer in front of me. The food is decent but not worth the price, time, or frustration."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch almost 3 times a week, I've dined in and drove thru they always get my order right when I drive in and that's almost impossible now with a lot of fast food places. I always get the cinnamon crunch and French toast bagels they are never hard or stale. The salads are nice and green I don't see bad lettuce which is also near impossible with fast food salads.
All and all I like this location it's never let me down and the staff are always nice"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of their new drive through (however, loss of star for several mistakes - lack of butter, lack of water both of which I asked for...) and I've always loved their mac n cheese and Caesar salads! Price is a bit spendy, but they always come through with a hearty meal. Make sure you ask for a dinner roll with your entree (it's free!). I would not recommend the tart lemonade."}
{"text":"Food was good as always but the cooking staff was incredibly rude when we asked for extra peppers. Nothing worse than rude people."}
{"text":"First time customer on Veterans Day. No discounts, no patriotic decor. Absolutely no VETERAN recognition or appreciation. NEVER COMING BACK AND WILL TELL  EVERYONE"}
{"text":"Tomatoe soup tasted just like a cheap Campbell's canned soup-gross. Thai salad was tasty, except for the cold frozen, processed chicken served with it. 

Service was fine. 

Flavored Tea was ok.

Coffee is overly sweetened.

Zupas beats this place by far."}
{"text":"Too pricey! ...$9 bucks for a steak sandwich with a few slices of steak, a piece of cheese and a few onions. Plus ordered a Thai \"chicken\" salad with absolutely NO chicken on it. Didn't even bother to call about it. They really should know how to make the salad by now. I go here less and less."}
{"text":"The food was amazing specially the mac & cheese, but I think the service could of been friendlier."}
{"text":"I wasn't very pleased with the service at this location.  First, I asked for dressing on the side and my salad was prepared with the dressing mixed right in. The woman was a little snide when I brought it up. Then I found nuts in the salad...When I brought that up the woman abruptly said, \"well we don't list our ingredients. \".... who doesn't list what is in the dish you're ordering??????? Considering I knew there was kale, beets, quinoa and citrus I think the ingredients were listed.....just not the ingredient that many people are allergic to...."}
{"text":"This store is absolutely filthy.  I went in to grab a quick dinner for my kids on their way to practice.  I read the exact order from my phone and had them make it.  As I was waiting I stood over by the drink area to get out of the way from the cashier to get out of the way of people trying to pay.  While I was there I noticed that the floor was sticky but looked up and saw a bottle of honey and figured someone must have spilled some.  I dropped off my kids dinner and then ran home to get some work I needed to catch up on and got a text that my daughters order was wrong.  Tough luck I told her, but just pick off what you don't like i'm sorry.  Not 2 minutes later my other daughter text that her food is also wrong, which kind of pisses me off because I literally read their order from my phone, and now they are both wrong??  I am literally sticking to my kitchen floor at this point so I take off my shoe to try and clean the honey off before I have to get out the door again and it wasn't honey, it was ***iING GUM!!!!  Disgusting!!!  So not only did I waste 22 dollars for food that will not be eaten, but now I have someones filthy gum stuck to the bottom of my shoe and I am pissed!  I called the manager because I was more pissed at this point about the gum than the sandwiches.  He of course was apologetic and offered to credit my card and to give us a free meal, which I refused because there is no way we will eat there again.  I just checked my credit card, and not only did he NOT credit my card, he re-charged me the $22.96!  So now I am just going to call my credit card company and refuse Both charges with them.  Employees are clearly not that bright, and the store is really dirty.  Don't eat here."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my food at paradise bakery. All ingredients seemed fresh, and healthy. The atmosphere was very casual, you can dine there and relax with friends as well as bring your kids. Favorite part was receiving free samples of their delicious cookies, served by some very nice ladies. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'm very familiar with Panera Locations in SoCal, and usually stop by in between classes at the Lakewood mall location. I was surprised they built one in north phoenix instead of building a paradise bakery. The food is okay, their soups and salads are good. They usually cheap out in the sandwiches so I actually prefer to just stick with their salads. A little pricy for the food you actually get but it's better then the fast food places around the area."}
{"text":"My husband had the Pecan sticky bun very good. It wasn't lunchtime yet but they made available the creamy chicken soup in their sourdough bread bowl. It hit the spot on a cold winter day. Their shortbread cookie was mmmmm.  Definitely will come again. Fast and welcoming service. Clean restaurant. What could be better? Add some television. Relaxing atmosphere for a quiet Sunday morning."}
{"text":"I was very excited when this new Panera opened close to my house but I have been very disappointed on several occasions.  Tables are often dirty, they are out of items and do not get the orders correct. On our most recent visit,  my husband ordered a sandwich and pasta and I ordered an edamame soba bowl.  After we placed the order and sat down we were told they were out of soba noodles but would substitute with lentil bowl and add edamame.  When are orders arrived I still did not have edamame added to my lentil bowl which was a substitution because they were out of soba noodles. My husband was informed that he would only get chips as a side item because they were out of bread. Also, my coffee was barely warm.  We eat out often and understand that things do happen from time to time but this particular location seems to struggle with the basics like bread and coffee. The staff is nice but are not concerned about issues around them."}
{"text":"Panera is generally one of those places you can go to where you know you'll get quick, simple food. Not today. So, this Panera has the new kiosks where you can put in your order directly. Cool. We used those. 1 sandwich and 1 half sandwich/half mac & cheese. Easy peasy. After 30 minutes, someone finally starts coming around saying that the kiosks are broken and they need to re-take our orders. Then half of the order comes. About 15 minutes later, the same server comes back and tells me they didn't put my order in and she needs to take it again. And they offer us a free cookie. So, to recap... after an hour, we finally get all of our food, the orders 30 minutes apart; we get a free cookie and nothing else. We get no real apology, no visit from a manager, no real explanation. Also, what really bothers me is that they didn't put a sign on their kiosks, nothing to warn people that they're not working. They wait until the order is in and then go visit people to get their orders. And I don't blame the server that came out at all, since the manager was hiding in the kitchen. Pathetic."}
{"text":"I have ordered to go here about 6 times and every single time the order has been wrong. I was not compensated for 6 of my to go orders being wrong which really made me upset. The only reason this review has more than one star is because the food I ordered in the store came in a decently timely manor and it was very good. I wish they would compensate the people who have received wrong orders."}
{"text":"Came for cookies, waited super long, then they tell me the cinnamon raisin are all out. Whomp!"}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer at this location of panera. About half of the time they do not make my order correctly or fail to follow the request of an extra side of dressing or not having a salad with a certain ingredient in it. Last week I ordered a bacon turkey bravo sandwich with extra dressing, drove all the way home with a grilled cheese. Unhappy with the service and laziness."}
{"text":"I love Panera but this location was pretty sad. The cashier was short with us, not friendly, and OBVIOUSLY didn't want to be there. Not only that but she forgot our drinks, desert tickets and buzzer to know when our food is ready. Then all of the tables are dirty, figures. I had to grab paper towel and clean it myself. The food was good but when I went to get a to go box the people making the food were being obnoxious and careless. Maybe good for pick up but not to dine in."}
{"text":"Really bad experience - ordered food for a business lunch at 11:43AM.  It was delivered at 12:51PM, but one third of order was missing.  The rest was not delivered until 1:55PM.  Order was still not 100% correct.  Gave up trying."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Panera but this location has steadily gone down hill since it first opened. I am in this area for work often and this used to be one of my favorite places to go.  

The last few times I have been here, service has been extremely slow, waiting almost 20 minutes for my food.  They also seem to be out of something each time.  I don't typically go during high volume times either, usually between 2-4:00 in the afternoon.   I can't imagine what it would be like when they have a rush.  

I will continue to go to Panera, but not this one.  There are a lot of other options in this area for lunch where I can get good food and better service."}
{"text":"I don't know why, but every time I order from the Panera on Greentree Rd, something is wrong with the order. The latest take out order was a you pick two: turkey and apple panini and the green goddess salad. The salad came without dressing and brown/wilted greens. The sandwich also had wilted greens, was sloppily arranged, and the bread was soggy and smashed. It is fair to say that with all fast food, you will not get a perfect meal/presentation, but comparatively, the Panera in Bridgeville never seems to have these issues and I eat at that one on a regular basis. For that reason, I recommend driving the extra 10 min to Bridgeville and avoid a let down at the one in Greentree."}
{"text":"Lunch crew completely dropped the ball today.  First, they gave me the wrong takeout bag.  Then, they gave me a bag with no utensils (which they insisted were in there) and no chips.   And this was with an extra employee working the pick-up counter to keep everything organized and moving.  Sheesh!"}
{"text":"I haven't learned my lesson the first 10 or so visits. The staff is really young and speaks inappropriately in front of customers. Child aged customers. The food is sloppily thrown together and doesn't even taste that great. If I'm ordering a sandwich with avocado on it, please don't slice a whole avocado in half and throw it under the bread. The portions for their soups and mac n cheeses get smaller and smaller upon each visit. It's just getting to be too much of a disappointment every time we patronize."}
{"text":"Normally they are on point. Today was not one of them. Order was completely wrong got a southwestern salad instead of a Asian chicken salad and the soup was watery and seemed old."}
{"text":"Another poor experience at this location.  Horrid customer service and when they run out of accompanying items that are supposed to go with full size orders, they simply dismiss the situation like it is no big deal yet charge you full price? Manager very unhelpful and quite unprofessional - needs further training! This is a poorly run franchise, Panera corporate should pull the flag! Boycott this place,! They've lost my business..."}
{"text":"Thank you for reminding me why I don't eat lunch at Panera anymore. I actually don't eat salads made of slimy, rotten lettuce."}
{"text":"The over all setting and atmosphere was pleasing, and everyone seemed to enjoy the job. I just wish that when I got my order and left, I would have looked first. They didn't give me my full order. By the time that I had left and almost gotten home it was too late. I will try another location next time."}
{"text":"First time at Panera Bread. Heard great things about it from coworkers and friends.

Time: Friday lunch
Ordered the turkey bacon sandwich and coffee.

First, coffee. The coffee was okay. Lots to choose from. The hazelnut was my first cup. Lots of grounds in the coffee. I don't mind the grounds since I drink a lot of toddy. However, the grounds in a brewed coffee leads me to believe that the coffee pot/carafee/brewer is not cleaned properly and/or not well maintained. The coffee iteself was weak and not very strong. Had the dark roast for my second cup and no grounds. The coffee was again weak and not very strong. HOWEVER, this isn't a coffee shop so take that for what it's worth.

The sandwich was mediocre at best. The turkey was bland and not much there. Bacon some pre cooked microwaved little pieces. The spread on the sandwich was pretty good.

Not the worst deli, but definitely not worth the drive or some place you go out of your way for."}
{"text":"Panera on Centre is basically like our second kitchen. My husband and I love that we can order online for a quick lunch/dinner, and we love that our infant's car seat fits perfectly in the booth for days we need to get out! My husbands job also requires him to bring breakfast/lunch to peoples offices so he is there VERY often for large orders. I would say 40% of the time this Panera messes up our orders, but we're not too picky and still eat what they give us...
However, the reason I'm writing this review is because we went there tonight for dinner. Granted it was towards close so we knew we didn't have much time to eat. There were approximately 12 people still sitting eating their meals, when we heard the employees not 1 time....not 2 times....but 3 times how \"people need to leave so they can clean the tables\", \"people need to leave because I have somewhere to go\", \"do people not know we're closing in a couple of minutes?!?!?\"  We also watched the manager lock the front door and scream out to someone that they're closed. This lead my husband to get up and scream, \"can I please finish my meal in peace! Is that ok!?!?!\" The employee responded yes and didn't say another word. Just simply awful."}
{"text":"Lets get one thing clear. Paradise Bakery way way better. Panera slashed portions, increased prices and serves gross food. I also want to know which geuinus bought a company that had the worlds best cookies and decided to change the recipe. The cookies are dense as bricks. I am so dissapointed. RIP paradise bakery, you'll be missed."}
{"text":"by far the worst panera i have ever been to. toasted bagels came out cold... service was horrible plus the bagels tasted like 1 weeks old bagels"}
{"text":"It's always busy but service is fast and friendly. Parking can be hard to find sometimes, but overall its everything that you can expect Panera Bread to be.

Also, the Internet could be little faster."}
{"text":"Who puts dried apple chips in a fuji apple chicken salad? This place, that's who!
Also, when I was asked if I wanted to add a pastry to my order for an additional 99 cents, I said \"no\" but was charged for it anyway. When I called the clerk out on the charge, she \"apologized\" and said I could pick any pastry out of the case.
I told her, \"No, I want a refund. If I wanted a pastry, I would have said 'yes' when you asked me the question in the first place.\"
I won't be dining at another Panera anytime soon."}
{"text":"Normally I would not eat here because I have a gluten intolerance.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much the employee, that took my order, knew about gluten-free menu items for Celiacs. I had soup and salad and both were very fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast and waited at the counter for service and finally someone reluctantly appeared to take my order. She took my order but had the disposition of either someone she knew just died or just got yelled at by her boss. Hope she has a better day today."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, parking was a bit of a pain because with so many other restaurants and businesses in the area it's hard to find any spaces especially during the lunch rush! 

But anyway, finally made it in and was surprised to find there was not a long line! I chose the Pick 2, with half Bacon Turkey Bravo sandwich and half Chopped Chicken Cobb with Avocado salad.

The Bacon Turkey Bravo has to be one of my favorite sandwiches here! It has Smoked turkey breast, bacon, smoked Gouda, lettuce, tomatoes and signature dressing, on Tomato Basil bread. My favorite part is the bread, it's so moist and fresh and pairs well in flavor with the Gouda cheese and turkey breast! 


The Chopped Chicken Cobb with Avocado salad was also delicious it has chicken, romaine lettuce, tomatoes, Applewood-smoked bacon, Gorgonzola cheese, hard-boiled eggs, with herb vinaigrette, topped with fresh avocado. It's like a flavor explosion in your mouth! The mix of cheese, chicken and bacon with the delicious herb vinaigrette dressing is wonderful! And the fresh avocado on top is such a nice treat!

I treated myself to a shortbread cookie as well, and it was huge and delicious! 

Overall, I had a nice experience here and look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"It was a really chilly day and I was in the Panera Bread strip mall, so I figured I would try them for lunch. I went for a small bowl of soup and half a sandwich. I chose the small size of the autumn squash and a half of a frontega chicken panini. Boy I make great choices. The soup was thick and very creamy. Great flavor. Just right for a cold day. The panini had chicken and melted cheese on a delicious focaccia bread. Another really tasty part of my lunch. More than filling. And they threw in a free Apple for dessert. All that for about eight and a half dollars. A good deal. Not gourmet. But very tasty and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Panera Bread many many times. We came in tonight for a fast dinner before going to a movie. We are not looking for gourmet food or fine dining. Just a fast inexpensive meal. The staff behind the counter was friendly and very helpful. The server who brought the food to the table was also incredibly friendly ( and very forgiving considering I knocked over my glass of water and she had to clean it up. She did it with a smile and a good sense of humor). I ordered the Southwest chicken salad. My wife got a BLT sandwich. My salad was actually quite good. Lots of chicken, lots of avocado, lots of corn and lots of chips. Overall a pretty good southwest chicken salad. My wife was disappointed with her sandwich. It wasn't bad it was just nothing special and you expect more from a sandwich at Panera Bread then just nothing special. Overall, it accomplished what we wanted. An informal inexpensive meal before a movie."}
{"text":"This place keeps getting cheaper.  Came here to get their big mocha for here - instead get a to-go cup and then when I asked for here they brought a tiny mug back. Almost $5 coffee that used to be a product that was craved this is disappointing.  Expensive and product keeps getting cheaper.  Time to find other options."}
{"text":"This Panera was great! I came in after breakfast, before a volleyball tournament. They managed to scrape together the stuff for me at no charge! Awesome service!!"}
{"text":"Consistently disgusting, stale, rotten and unsanitary. Maybe get a bagel here if you're in a pinch, but I would not recommend anything more. Over the course of the past year, I ordered three different salad options (prepackaged, yuck) and they were all nasty. I received one today and it had a HAIR in it. Almost barfed. Also, the \"bread\" that came with it was hard as a rock. 

My husband ordered a sandwich from here today and the tomatoes were rotten. How on earth this place stays in business is beyond me. This is why we need to minimize crappy franchises like this. A smaller business would never survive, trying to sell this garbage. 

After giving too many chances to this Panera, I will never come here again."}
{"text":"Super slow. Not enough people working on a busy Sunday 
23 minutes for 2 bags and cream cheese.

They were much better on Scottsdale road"}
{"text":"Great service everyone from the manager down. Much better service than the cactus location."}
{"text":"New review--- ordered my FAVORITE Greek salad while at the drive thru, got home and they didn't have the pickled onions on the salad! UGH that's the best dang part of the salad! Such a let down to get home 15 min later to a half asses order! So to anyone else that LOVES their Greek salad - i guess you need to make sure you ask for that even though the menu has that as part of the salad :("}
{"text":"Used to love Panera, however the last time I went, there was an excessive wait time just for them to get my order wrong. I decided to give them another chance tonight and placed the order online to ensure I wasn't waiting for over 30-45 min and to ensure the order was correct as it is written on the receipt. Well, to no avail, the order was completely incorrect and the workers prepping the food had no concern or care to ensure that it was done correctly. I am so over poor work ethic and having no pride in a job...doesn't matter if you're in food service or you are a ceo of a company, you should take pride in what you do and do your job correctly...I will no longer be going to Panera and will be returning any gift cards I have purchased for the holidays!"}
{"text":"Panera has mediocre food and there service sucks and they are massively over priced 
Messed up my name got my order wrong
10 dollars for a stupid sandwich 
...
Do yourself a favor and go to in n out its cheaper, faster, and just overall better."}
{"text":"No matter which time of the day I visit, there's always a line. Typically go in for bagels and decided to actually eat food here for once. 
They have a Pick 2 menu which pretty much lets you build your meal :) 
Went with the steak + cheese panini and mandarin walnut salad. Also came with chips, drinks are additional. 
As far as portions, think of healthy filling, but could eat more if you wanted to, sizes. It was a bit on the pricier end for what you get, but was nice to try. Wasn't the biggest fan of the horseradish in the panini, but I guess that's just personal preference. 

If you plan on coming to Panera often, get the rewards card"}
{"text":"Ive come here quite a few times since the location was built , i think to myself sweet metro center is improving but more and more im disappointed . The bathroom is  filthy , and  then my food was brought to me today and the spoon had food on it , i went to their counter and i saw the bin with more spoons , i grab one its got crusty food on it  , i grab another its got food on it too. I look at the clerk and was like did the dishwasher quit? They hand me a spoon from their bin on the other side its just as dirty. Then i reach in the bin i was pulling from already to pull out two spoons stuck together with food holding them together... im not coming here again !   Metro center is ghetto , this area is filled with people with no integrity."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a nice place to grab a bite and work on some homework or study, this is a great alternative for a cafe! I don't recommend playing games like League or Overwatch here since their wifi isn't that fast. The service here is friendly and their food is amazing. Everything comes out fast, they're very accommodating and they have free refills on their delicious green tea!! 
I normally get their broccoli cheddar bowl with a side of bread and it always fills me up!"}
{"text":"Renee the manager greeted us and walked us through the food choices with patience and a pleasant attitude. The food is delicious and service, we will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Go here every morning for either breakfast or lunch.  A lot of menu items that is really delicious such as their chicken salad sandwich, chicken noodle soup, and of course their bagels.  The majority of the staff members are super friendly and pleasant."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the waterfront panera since it opened regularly, and the past year it has really gone down hill. My third time ordering ahead there tonight and my half salad was literally 10 pieces of lettuce chopped .Very disappointing how quality has gone down I would have rather eaten a salad from Wendy's than what they just gave me, not to mention I asked specifically for extra  croutons and got TWO in my 1/4 cup salad . Needless to say, I'll be letting our friends and family who frequent this panera regularly to switch to another location ."}
{"text":"The food at this fast food/sit down restaurant hybrid comes to your table quick and fresh. You order at the front and the food is brought to your table. It's mostly soups, sandwiches, bagels, and pastries. It's all well done, but nothing extraordinary. It's a little on the high end in terms of fast food prices, but on the bottom for a sit down so I guess it works out. It's a cool place to chill out and relax, eat and maybe get some work done on the free Wi-Fi. I'm glad this American chain has made its way North, just don't expect extraordinary food."}
{"text":"Came here recently pre-soccer game because I wanted to go out for food and didn't want anything too greasy or heavy pre-game. I did the Pick 2 (choose 2 dishes plus a side) with a half chicken Cobb salad with avocado, a half grilled turkey panini and an apple on the side. The panini was kind of a letdown, with the half sandwich feeling pretty underwhelming for the 5 bucks I paid for it. A little small and the mustard based sauce a little too overpowering for me. Still there was plenty of bacon, cheese, and turkey, so it was still passable. The salad however was pretty awesome: LOTS of avocado, bacon chunks, egg, and chicken in the half salad. Next time I might just order this alone. It seemed like a more than reasonable portion and everything was fresh and tasty. I mean with bacon, chicken, and avocado in a nice creamy sauce it's kind of hard to go wrong. And this is coming from a 'give-me-real-food!!' non-salad eating kind of guy.
This location has a pretty friendly/helpful staff and I still appreciate chilling at a table enjoying the free wifi while my food gets prepared and brought to me. 
Also, if you're going to Panera often enough the rewards program seems pretty decent. I've gone to Panera Bread 4 times and gotten 2 free items (a smoothie and a brownie) which kind of makes me feel a little better about the slightly higher than average prices."}
{"text":"Bacon Turkey Bravo good quick lunch sandwich . customer service was especially good today."}
{"text":"We stopped for a quick supper because we like the food at Panera. Like so many places the women's bathroom needed attention and every table we sat at was sticky."}
{"text":"2 of us are so disappointed in Panera.  The chipotle chicken melt panini was so scrawny I would have been embarrassed to serve to guests much less to a paying customer. Even a phone call to corporate got nothing but \"sorry your experience was not good.\"  I asked how many ounces of chicken should have been on the chipotle chicken melt sandwich. I was told that information was proprietary.  The price of the whole panini was $8.79. I sincerely feel that I did not get nine dollars worth of a sandwich. Now I am looking at other reviews for this location and I see a pattern of dissatisfaction. I will not return to The Paradise Valley location. And I am seriously considering not returning to any Panera store based on my phone call to corporate. The soup and salad was good and the price was OK. But there are several other nearby restaurants that care about customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"Love P.B., to bad eventually on a long enough time frame you're going to get bad service.  It's been a 45 min. since I ordered and I've asked twice about my meal.  Several groups have shown up after me, have eaten, and left.  Didn't know a bowl of soup and a sandwich was to tall of an order.

Update, nice lady came by with my meal and offered a refund.  Her genuine concern and my belief you should pay what you owe were more than enough to understand the mistake. I refused the refund.Will return."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!  Delivery driver, Noe, is extremely rude and argumentative.  The manager, Joel, is not helpful at all.  Our company will never order food from here for business meetings again."}
{"text":"expected it to be a good panera like the others...ordered chili...they gave me probably  a half of a scoop of it in a bread bowl (the bread bowl was barely scooped out). Not worth the money. TERRIBLY SMALL PORTIONS! This was true with my whole table of 10 people...burned 2 bagels AND served them cold after taking 15 minutes to bring it out. will never return to this panera, thinking i won't ever come to any panera again after this experience. Another person got grilled cheese...it wasn't grilled. literally cold and smushy...more like a cheese sandwich"}
{"text":"When I need a place to do work on my laptop, Panera is my go-to spot. The Mayfield Heights Panera offers everything I expect from a Panera: a place to sit for a few hours without being bothered, excellent WiFi, and a decent Greek salad."}
{"text":"So glad that Panera kept some of the Paradise Bakery items. The Pick 2 menu contains a variety of soups, salads, and sandwiches. The staff is fast and friendly. They also added a few kiosks so that you can place your order. I like that they added a monitor and you can see the status of your order. Overall, a great place and good quality."}
{"text":"I have always loved Pantera and this location is awesome! It is so clean and always has fast service! Their coffee is always hot and most of all I love that they have so many outlets and free wifi so I can work on my computer while I have coffee! They also have the best tomato soup ever! Love this place!"}
{"text":"My son and I just had dinner at this Panera Bread location. He got chicken noodle soup and a Fuji Apple Chicken Salad.  I got the Soba Noodle Bowl and half a Bacon Turkey Bravo sandwich.  First, we thought they might be closing because as we got there the one dining area was closed off with the chairs stacked on the tables. I asked about it and was told they were cleaning - at 7 p.m. when you don't close until 10 p.m.?!  Both the chicken noodle soup and the Soba Noodle Bowl were luke warm at best. The Fuji Apple Chicken Salad was loaded with blue cheese - my son dislikes blue cheese and has had this salad a number of times and loved it - with the correct cheese - Gorgonzola. which is what is listed in the ingredients. They were out of apples as the side so had no choice but the baguette, which was actually very cold. This location seems to always be out of something when we go there.  One Friday night they were out of Clam Chowder and it was only around 5 p.m..Needless to say our experience here was very poor, if it had been our first time there we would never go back.  Cafe Zupa's has Panera Bread beat all the way around, wish they were closer. Oh, and as for the chairs stacked on the tables for cleaning, about 3 minutes before we left a worker was in the area sweeping and the using a push vacuum, they really needed to close off the are 3 hours before closing for that?  I felt like they were wanting us out of the restaurant! Won't be going back."}
{"text":"This location is consistent with other locations across the country. If you have been to other Panera's, you will know what to expect. The decor is a little more updated compared to some locations."}
{"text":"Do you enjoy setting piles of money on fire? Then I have the perfect eatery for you. This over priced dumpster fire is the best place to get served a sandwich fit for a 3 year old and moldy lettuce. The lady at the register is SUPER friendly. If you are trying to remember what sandwich you had in the past and ask her, she will make you explain yourself and make you feel real dumb. I mean come on, study the Panera menu before you come in, idiot. Also, for sure tell her if you have an allergy because she will explain how the handle the situation as if you've never dealt with it. Then they will hand you a buzzer for when your food is ready. But hey, why the heck should they use that when they can just leave your food on the counter and leave you in a limbo of wonder if that plate is yours or someone else who ordered the exact same thing. Before you leave they will also be sure to tell you if you set the dishes incorrectly on the top of the trash Overall, fantastic experience, highly professional and clean restaurant with top quality food well worth your $60."}
{"text":"Panera is my \"go-to\" lunch spot.

No matter what I'm craving, sweets, bagels, smoothies, sandwiches, salad or soup it's here....perfect!!

I'm a total fan of  the \"You Pick 2\". I almost always get it when I visit and I leave full and happy. And how awesome is it that you can add a bakery treat for $.99...whoo hoo!

So I was here a little after 2pm, there were a few people ahead of me but it didn't bother me since it gave me time to drool over the desserts, muffins, scones and cookies. 

My cashier was awesome, very funny and perky. She was a great employee to have and excellent customer service. 

I decided to keep in simple today, nothing new just one of my usuals the Sierra turkey sandwich which has turkey breast, chipotle mayonnaise, field greens, red onions on asiago Cheese Focaccia and the Greek salad which has Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, feta cheese, peperoncini, red onions, olives, pepper and Greek dressing.

The asiago cheese focaccia is heavely...I would eat this bread all day if I could...it's so freaking good. But I digress, the sandwich was great, I love the chipotle mayo mixed with the field greens and focaccia...such a great combination of flavors. The salad was delicious too, I'm really like the combination of the feta cheese, dressing and peperoncini and that crisp romaine lettuce....Mmmmm 

For dessert I picked the cinnamon roll...O M G....even though I was stuffed, I actually managed to have one bite after my lunch and it was yummy! I'm saving the rest for tomorrow morning with a cup of coffee...Mmmm I can't wait! 

I'm just such a huge fan of this place, I love the food and the combinations of flavors. I mean really, what is there not to love about Panera???

Seriously, delicious food...good service at this place. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is a general review for Panera.  I really think they've gone down hill over the last couple years since they've started making changes.  You used to be able to make your own sandwich.....gone.  They started with the broth bowls and I got one that was SO good.....gone, the only one they have now is a mexican/fiesta type.  The amount of meat on the sandwiches has gotten to the point that it's hard to even see it there's so little of it.  I've had their catering and the amount of meat on those is even less....one slice of meat and a slice of cheese.  WHEN PEOPLE SAY THEY'RE GOING TO PANERA FOR LUNCH NOW I SAY NO THANK YOU.  I USED TO LIKE IT, NOT ANYMORE.  $ VALUE FOR WHAT YOU GET IS IN THE TOILET."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Everyone is friendly, and helpful! 
Sometimes the screen is wrong though. Your name will appear on the screen as it's \"ready\" but still takes a few for the food to come out.. and then your name goes away while still waiting but that's not a deal breaker for me. I love the food! :D"}

{"text":"I absolutely L-O-V-E Panera Bread. I logged on to complain about the slow internet connection and the air conditioner on full blast but I just can't!

The staff is soooo friendly and I just really enjoy the vibe here. So many budding entrepreneurs, freelancers and consultants under one roof totally excites me.

All the laptops, tablets and ear pieces remind me that there is culture of folks on the grind, in active pursuit of fulfilling their passion and following their dreams.

Each way I look, I see someone with a portfolio, preparing to wow a potential client or nail the sale.

For all the business professionals in Panera Bread, keep going. Don't give up! Your dreams will soon be a reality!

Oh and the food is amazing! A win-win! Now just turn the air down, it's October and increase your bandwith!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Panera! Great for lunch, lots of options and if you can't pick--do the \" pick two\" you'll get two decent servings of something you like! Always tastes fresh and in my opinion better then paradise!"}
{"text":"Bottomline: they stood behind counters and sipped on their drinks til we asked for service.. After exhchanging glances. Maybe management has changed? Or in fact, maybe there is NO MANAGEMENT whatsoever. We walked in Monday evening. No one in line. Four people working behind the counter. I have never been to panera before so I was looking forward to a good experience. However, the service was so bad. I didn't even want to eat here after. 

I signed up for a rewards card online and it told me to get the card in-store as I've heard downtown locations are good. I walked in and told the cashier Ive never been here before and want to get my loyalty card. She had no clue what I was talking about and was not polite at all. I would expect some explanatiom on how the pick two even works.. After i told her this is my first timeShe just walked away and grabbed her manager after giving me a look.. The manager came and didn't even speak a word. She just looked at me and I handed her the card number. I proceeded to ask about the menu and she either ignored me or gave me two word replies. After she gave me my card she just walked away. we continued to just STAND THERE.. while the other servers who were pretending to work in the back/kitchen -sipping on their drinks- . we had to actually blatantly say out loud \"can we get some help here?\" Which we absolutely hate to do. After this.. I just got my pastry and left. Did not bother having dinner here. I will NEVER BE BACK."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with friends the other day and must say I was surprised I haven't tried this place sooner!

Cafe prices for the food here. It's not a cheap place for a sandwich if you are comparing to a Subway, but the flavor and quality of food is as good as it gets in my opinion. I went to Panera TWICE (different locations) and food was served consistently. Cashiers know their menu and helped me choose my items. Paninis were crispy, warm, and loaded with chicken. YUMMY

I ordered Pick 2 which runs about $7.95 (I think). Choosing a \"Signature\" option will add $1 to the combo. French Onion soup and the Frontega Chicken, which is a signature option. Worth it. It's $1 cheaper than a lunch combo of sandwich and soup/salad at other places like Yard House anyway.

Feeling fancy for breakfast or brunch but dont' want to go to a sit down, menu type of restaurant? Go Panera instead :]"}
{"text":"All the plates keep getting smaller and smaller, and prices up and up.... taste was the worst .... theyy change way to much would not be returning"}
{"text":"WOW. What a disaster today was!
First off, you walk in, and it is overwhelmingly warm.

We ordered, I had the asiago roast beef, with tomato soup, and a baguette.
My aunt had a turkey sandwich, but she asked them told hold the onion, and instead of the chipotle mayo, if they could substitute it for regular mayo,...(she doesn't do spicy very well), and ordered a bag of chips with her lunch.

We find a place to sit, and our plates come.
The chips and the baguette weren't on the right plate, but okay. I guess that's an easy switch.

But you could clearly see the huge slices of red onion, and the huge glob of chipotle mayo on my aunt's sandwich. She takes it up to the counter to have it remade.

I'm sitting with my daughter, and before I take a bite out of my sandwich, I see a stand of plastic wrap hanging out of it. It is VERY noticeable, and I am beginning to wonder how no one saw it....I then take my plate up to be remade.

The manager informed me that it was \"from the cheese\".

Girlfriend, I do not care where it is from. I don't want it in my sandwich.
She came by with our new plates afterwards, and offered us a free cookie, but we declined.

The food was Ok. The soup was the savior of it all for me.
Yikes."}
{"text":"Update.....no update. 15 days later and I still haven't received a refund. What horrible management!"}
{"text":"I'm leaving a one star because the delivery drivers they have are NOT familiar with the area. I ordered my salad, soup, and bagel at 11:30 AM and was having it delivered to my work in the Quarter (about 3 miles north of the restaurant). I look at the tracker and the driver is CIRCLING around my work. He doesn't know where my work is, so he just marks it delivered and goes on his way. I call the store, the store calls the driver, as protocol. THE DRIVER SAYS HE CALLED MY WORK AND MY CELL PHONE. For an HOUR at work no one called either phone numbers, no one came in to look at my work, no one came in for a gift card, no one even came to delivery to my work. So the guy tells me (it's 12:20, I'm just hungry) that I will be reimbursed and that he'll make it up to me (ASSUMING I WILL GET MY FOOD FOR FREE). I wait ANOTHER HOUR. I call again. He tells me he never said he'd send me the food just reimburse me. TO MAKE IT UP TO A CUSTOMER SOMETIMES YOU HAVE REFUND AND GIVE AWAY FREE STUFF. We do it ALL THE TIME where I work. So now, I'm just upset, starving, and will probably NEVER order delivery from the Panera app while I'm at work again. 

Below is a screenshot of all the calls I have received and made today. NOTICE THE STORE IS THE ONLY ONE (minutes the one at the top, which was to my fiancé who is now bringing me food). Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I dropped by last night to satisfy a late craving for a panini.  I had the Fontana Chicken panini for the first time.  I tasted a chipotle mayo, chicken, cheese, I don't know what else, but it sure satisfied my craving.  This is going to be my new favorite sandwich at Panera.  

I almost made a clean get away, but while I was waiting on my sandwich, the Chocolate Duet with Walnut cookies began calling my name.  They got louder and louder.  Me, not wanting a scene in the restaurant, decided to submit to the call of the Chocolate Duet Walnut cookies and I took home two huge cookies that sort of resembled brownies.  MMM semisweet chocolate chunks with white chocolate chips,  gasp!  I managed to just eat 1/2 of one and freeze the rest for later.  But omg, they were so decadent.  I mean, some things you just don't need to know about.  But once you taste these cookies, the lid is off Pandora's box!  haha

Everything is so great at Panera, what is not to like?  Moderation..........

Can't wait to visit and sit outside with a friend!"}
{"text":"I hung out here last week while I was waiting on my car to be repaired.  I was able to use the Panera WiFi to do some work.  The frustrating thing is that it kept kicking me off every 10 to 20 minutes.  I am not sure why that is, but I was able to get done the things I needed to get done that day.  

I did have lunch outside.  I had a Chicken Noodle Soup and Half Mediterranean Vegetable Sandwich on tomato basil bread, chips and Green Tea.  I just love that green tea, it sure hits the spot.  It was a nice place to hang out, have a nice lunch and wait for the car.  

They do a brisk business at the Henderson location right in front of the Galleria Mall.  It was fun to people watch and see who was coming in and out of the restuarant.  

The menu has been updated to pasta, salad and sandwich combinations.  I was getting weak kneed but was able to walk away from the pasta carbs!"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed today when I ordered my food online and selected rapid pickup. I arrived and grabbed my bag (obviously I know now I should've checked my order before leaving). 
I ordered a group size chicken and rice. And a turkey on wheat sandwich. Well I got home and I was given chicken noodle soup. Which is fine BUT literally all I had was broth. There was no way to share it with \"4 servings\" because it had a couple of noodles and chicken in it. It was literally all broth. Then my sandwich had maybe two pieces of turkey on it. It was just thrown on the bread not even spread out. Pretty disappointed. It cost me $24! Plus time and gas to go grab lunch bc they do not deliver in mountains edge. I called and the refunded me but still. For the price you pay this is horrible. Will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Panera I've been too.  I ordered the pasta with afredo and chicken and barely got a cup's worth for $9.59 - with just a tiny bit of shredded chicken on top.  When I asked if they got my order right (I ordered the large) they said yep, that's the large.  Wow.  I also got a brownie which they have in boxes at the front counter when you place your order.  Looked good, so I got it.  Blech.  Dry and, not that it matters, but the icing was on the bottom.  It just shows that they don't care about quality, only pumping out orders.  I had been going there frequently just because it's the closest thing for me to walk to from work, but I'm changing it up - Fired Pie is way better food and you get more for your money, but back to Paners....  I normally order the Napa Almond Chicken Salad sandwhich.  It's tasty, but you get mostly tomatoe and lettuce and not much chicken salad.  I ordered half the sandwich one day and got MORE chicken salad on half than I ever did on the whole.  They also have a problem getting the correct food to the correct tables.  One day I had two different orders placed in front of me by two different clerks and neither was mine, so I only wonder how many people my food was placed in front of before I received it. 

With that said, the staff is friendly and helpful, but the processes and quality are subpar."}
{"text":"You wouldn't think of going to a bakery for lunch when your trying to eat low carb but me and my wife decided to try out Panera for lunch and get a salad. Being on a low carb  diet and going to Panera was rough to say the least. We were tempted by just the smell of breads, cakes and cookies that were made that day and we weren't sure that a salad was going to satisfy our hunger. My wife ordered the Green Goddess cobb salad with chicken and I ordered the Southwest Chile Lime ranck chicken salad. Both came with a side dinner roll which we declined instead we choose the apple and took it home. We both had the fresh brewed tea which was really good when mixed with the pomegranate tea. We got our salads fairly quickly and we dug in. The salad was tastier than I expected. The chicken breast was very juicy and full of  favor. The dressing had a little kick to it and well with the salad. All and all we were happy with our lunch and will come back again."}
{"text":"One of the worst Panera locations. Rude and dirty. Not what you would expect from a Panera. Many other locations, go somewhere else if you want quality food and service."}
{"text":"Good food but they got my order wrong. I was on that side of town so I decided to stop to pick up lunch. About 24 dollars and change later no lunch for me :( 
Asked for no tomatoes  (due to a mild allergy) and no onions (they overpower the salad).  They had my request on the receipt correct, but they were on my food. I called the manager Joe who offered to replace my meal. That was very nice, but I live no where near this location. I guess I wouldn't be doing this bad review if I didn't pay so much for the meal. Really disappointed....

Update:
The manager Joe replaced my whole order free of charge so I changed my stars to 3!"}
{"text":"Couldn't even wait to get out of the restaurant to write this review. The staff cooking the food currently is making inappropriate jokes in front of customers (very loudly at that-talking over the customers in the restaurant). My boyfriend ordered a blueberry pomegranate smoothie and we had to go up not once, but twice to remind them-and someone had gotten the same one before us who had ordered awhile after we had. The only positive thing I can say about this panera experience was that our cashier was very polite. Don't plan on coming to this location again.

Update: finally got the smoothie 15 minutes after we finished eating."}
{"text":"The food is good.  The service is terrible.  
Not our first time giving them a second chance and they can not seem to get it together.  
Then they are disrespectful and rude \"What would you like me to do about it\" was the quote I recently received from a manager after they neglected to put a few items from our to go order in the bag.  
Really, you are supposed to make sure the whole order is in the bag, and then if not, provide some sort of compensation, not a lecture on how I need to check my own bag.  
We will be visiting the Biltmore location from now on."}
{"text":"One of my favorite choices for fast, quality casual dining. I love using the free wi-if to eat a good meal and get some work or reading done. 
The atmosphere is really nice, with a great interior and medium-sized dining area. 
For a quick bite I highly recommend the grilled cheese with bacon."}
{"text":"Went at lunch time on a weekday. Fast and easy. Ordered to go. Will Try again. Three soups and sandwiches."}

{"text":"First time ever eating here. BOMB.COM this food is AMAZING. Staff is super friendly as well!"}
{"text":"The amount of hate I have for this Panera Bread is not ok at all. I have been to other Panera Bread locations and this is by far the worst one without a doubt. I personally love a free meal [who doesn't?] but the fact that I have eaten at this location 4 times and only paid for 1.5 of those visits is not ok. I would love to give them 5 stars because I really do LOVE Panera Bread but this location falls flat.

The first time I came here was great cause all I ordered was 2 bowls of soup. It isn't that hard to put soup in bowls and get it to a table. But the 2nd and 3rd time were not that great. I am a \"semi-vegetarian\" so pork and red meat are meats that I will not consume so when I walk into any food establishment I already know my choices are a bit limited. The 2nd time I went to this location I ordered a simple pick 2 lunch with soup and a grilled cheese sandwich. Seems really simple right...NO! I know they have a simple grilled cheese and a big kid grilled cheese with BACON but there is no way he could have \"mistakenly\" heard big kid grilled cheese while I was ordering. So needless to say when I bit into a piece of bacon I was beyond upset. I did keep my composer and had a talk with the manager who then rushed me out a new sandwich and gave me a full refund [that I did not ask for or demand in any way].

My 3rd visit was a To Go order and was two salads with some modifications, nothing major at least in my mind. I ordered the amazing Fuji Apple Salad and the Thai Chicken Salad both with modifications that are based on taste preference. Because I was about to work a double I planned to have 1 salad for my lunch right before my shift and the other for my meal later on in my shift but thank goodness I work in a restaurant or I would have gone hungry that day. To make a long story short every modification I asked for was passed over and disregarded. So I did call and complain to which a second refund was given to me.

There is a saying \"fool me once shame on me, fool me twice shame on you\" I definitely should have chose another place to grab dinner on my way home but I figured the 3rd visit was a To Go so I should have looked in the bag before I left so I gave them a 2nd chance and I wish I didn't. I ordered a Thai Chicken Salad and a Chipotle Sandwich [that has BACON to which I specifically stated that I am a semi-vegetarian and did not want the bacon]. Before I leave I open the salad box to make sure the modifications on that are good and this time they were. I then open the sandwich box and the sandwich looks like it should look. I get home and once again bite into BACON -__- like I couldn't even understand how that could happen. But I did call and yelled at the manager at this point I was beyond done with this place she did give me a refund on the sandwich after I was done yelling. I work at a restaurant so I understand what goes on beyond the counter so brushing it off, as a simple mistake was not about to happen.

Needless to say I will no longer be going back to this location for my Panera fix."}
{"text":"Food is simple (4/5), but healthy and very fresh.
But the service is amazing (5/5).  Food is delivered to your table in a prompt and very friendly manner.   Food is also removed from your table and service is always with a smile. 

Very family oriented spot in a super convenient location."}
{"text":"I go to this Panera all the time because it is right next to my work and that is probably the only reason I go there. The staff is never really friendly and they don't care about their customers. I wish it was still Paradise Bakery!!"}
{"text":"We do a lot of catering at our business and also use several different catering companies.  Panera Bread (used to be Paradise) has always given us excellent service and food. One of the BEST people in the company is \"Elyse\".  She has been with Panera for awhile now and we have all come to trust her to make our events the best.  She has never let us down. Thank you for all you do Panera and Elyse!!!"}
{"text":"This location's customer service could really use improvement. I continue to eat at Panera because I like their food and it's a healthy-ish option close to home but the staff always seem annoyed, irritated that you are there, and like you have severely inconvenienced them. I've started ordering online and picking it up through the drive thru just to avoid the staff."}
{"text":"I'm always a fan of Panera- anywhere. This Panera is no different! Great place to study, read the paper, or have a relazing lucnh/dinner with friends.

Make sure you register your Panera card because you get get great perks when you use it (put the key chain card on your key chain that way you ALWAYS have it)."}
{"text":"I never give negative reviews if I can help it but the server was super rude. It's also awkward to wait for a to go order. You don't really have anywhere to stand. Over priced for the tiny amount of food you get. Honestly, I miss paradise bakery. If my boyfriend didn't like the Cesar salad, id never ho here and boycott it forever. If I'm going to pay gormet prices for tiny amounts of food , the food should at least be memorable."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience, never again will I visit this panera again!  I ordered my food on the app \"grab and go\" at 12:30pm, we were told 10 minutes from the app that our food would be ready, we arrived at the store at 1:15pm and the girl behind the counter said they didn't have our order, she checked in the computer and said for some reason our order didn't cross over.  She said I will start your order, which was a pick 2,a sandwich and salad,  3 people came in behind us and all 3 people received there orders before we did! I was not happy, so as I stood there the manager finally asked what are you waiting for?  So I told her and she handed me my order,  nothing was done to compensate me for the inconvenience,  i thought I would be able to order and pick up my order quickly before having to go to work! My quick lunch turned into almost an hour long ordeal!  Then we get home and I open up my chicken salad sandwich and it looks like they put 2 tablespoons on it, this place is so screwy! Hire some people who know what they are doing!  I will be spreading the word around not to eat here because I was highly upset!"}
{"text":"I have seen this place for years.. Never went in until we moved into our new home, and one day was exhausted from unpacking, and decided to try it out. LOVE it.. I loved the Autumn squash soup, and their sandwiches,. oh and the beverages are unique and amazing.. Loved the lemonades, & teas.. I thought they only sold bread items.. They have pastries, bagels etc.  I did stop by also a buy a loaf of tomato basil bread and they sliced it  for me.,Nice spot to get a bite to eat and relax."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!! Went in tonight for a to go order that consisted just of two bread bowl soups. We ordered a chicken and wild rice and a creamy tomato soup. The line was maybe 8 people deep and there was only one cashier. So we order our food and go and wait in the waiting area. The girl comes running to us and says sorry that they don't have any more bread bowls. Ok no problem. We get two bowls. Like a hot second later she comes back and says they don't have one of the soups we ordered. Um okay which soup? She says she doesn't know. She goes and asks and then comes back and says it's the chicken and wild rice one. Oh gosh and this point I just want to walk out. They don't have anything and its 6 pm. Shouldn't they have stuff for dinner? 
Anyways, I'm not going back to this place. Everyone is lost and apparently there's no communication."}
{"text":"Panera Bread is a great place to stop by for a quick, healthy lunch. I usually get their \"pick two\" combo. Their french onion soup is decent, but personally I find that there are way too many croutons and almost no cheese which is disappointing. I've also tried their cream of chicken and wild rice which isn't bad. Their steak & arugula sandwich, as well as their new chipotle chicken avocado melt (panini), are safe choices."}
{"text":"Don't eat from here if you want to live . My husband got food poisoning from the green goddess salad . After eating a few hours later he began vomiting and cramping a lot . I had the tortellini it  was over cooked . I will NEVER eat from this place again ."}
{"text":"I can't stay away from here!!!! The Thai chicken salad is my ultimate favorite item on the menu and I need it at least a few times a month! The staff are always super friendly and it's always very clean! Quick service which is great when you go in for lunch break! 
Portions are much larger then what you think thwy will be, so maybe order the small just to be safe!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal.  It's a chain.  The food is always the same.  The wait always the same.  The taste always the same.  The people are friendly.  Spice it up though!"}
{"text":"Firstly, I'm not discouraging people from taking their business there. This is just my hope that this won't happen again in future visits. Panera is a great place when looking for a quick, affordable sandwich and - always loved this place but a couple thinks worth sharing:

Cons: but I've noticed some disappointing orders  over the course of three separate orders (weeks apart) as well. I always get the frontera chicken panini, which is always to my liking at other locations and it's making it clear to me that they make the sandwiches in advanced like most places do. The problem is, it's becoming obvious that when premaking the sandwiches, they are adding the condiments/sauces on the pre made sandwich. Meaning, each time I get my sandwich (which I do take to go, but mind you I live maybe 2 miles away, so I know that this wouldn't happen in the 3-4 minute drive home) that when I do finally get to enjoy my panini sandwich, the bread is soggy to the point where only maybe half of it is still edible. I end up waiting half of my $8 sandwich, which is something I don't have the luxury to waste since I do work part time to get through grad school. 
Second con being the inaccuracies of the order. I ask for no onions or tomatoes, and add an additional layer of mozzarella (along with an additional $1.50 charge. Fine with the charge, they make it clear in the order screens. But both 2/3 times I've done this, I'm not only left with no extra mozzarella, but noticed this latest time that there was almost no cheese on it at all! That's essentially $2 worth of cheese basically acting as a donation to them. I find this surprising that this happens quite often, and I'm not the only person who's had trouble with inaccurate orders. My biggest hope though is to ask that pre made Paninis exclude the sauces until actual cooking time, while spreading it onto the top layer of both sides of the sandwich, so the bread doesn't go Soggy. Lastly, this is a small complaint, but the lemonade tends to look a little dirty in that container. Maybe changing it out with new drink containers and lemonade once In awhile will make The lemonade look more appealing. These experiences are the reason for 3 stars.

Pros: they have great service. The staff is always very nice and makes my food in a more than reasonable amount of time. As a person in grad school full time on top of working full time, quick food prep places like Panera (I don't consider this fast food like many might) tends to be my biggest food choice. It's nice to grab a quick sandwich or salad after a long day of work, classes and homework. In addition, I LOVE the quick order option using iPads. It makes is easier to see the options, without having to ask questions on what is included in each order. They also give options to take off any ingredient in the relative food, with add-on options. It is also broken down by menu categories (sandwiches/Paninis, bakery goods, sides and spreads, salads) are some examples of categories. Clicking the category of interest brings up all that is offered. 

In sum, I truly do enjoy Panera, have for years. My hope is that some minor improvements be made to the sandwich/panini making process. This could Reduce the bread become too soggy to eat or pick around when I paid for an entire panini. Otherwise, I will give it another shot!"}
{"text":"This is the Myers Park location.  Their menu confuses me as does the layout in all of their stores.  Everything's split into sections that I can't seem to categorize.  Soups vs. sandwiches?  Or entrees vs. salads?  I can never figure out what line I should be standing in to place my order.   

But the staff is friendly and helpful.  When I ask for something specific they're always able to point out something similar on their menu and help me order what I want for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"My pick up order was short a salad and I didn't discover it until I was home. Luckily, Nick made this right. I appreciate his good customer service and quick response."}
{"text":"This is by far the slowest Panera I have ever been to. There are 5 people behind the counter and only 1 person working on orders. I am beyond pissed & going to miss a flight due to the slow and lazy workers."}
{"text":"Worst Panera I've ever been to.  They're constantly out of things and always takes forever in the drive through."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I adore Panera Bread.  This Friday 9/22 afternoon I decided to surprise my office staff with lunch. (Order #151471672) We were all excited that delivery is now an option. As we work at the Kyrene School District and getting away from our desk can be difficult. Unfortunately, we did not receive the order for over 2 hours after it was placed. Even though, the website said 45min delivery time. When we called to check on our order after we had not received it in the timely manner. We could not get anyone to answer the phones to help us. While I do understand that you do have busy times we were calling outside of the lunch rush hours listed on your phone recording. I finally called another Panera location (3141 w. frye) and spoke with a manager named Brian who provided me with great customer service. He assured me that he would contact the manager at the correct location and get the issues resolved. Brian did call me back within a 20 min time frame and let me know that my credit card would be credited for the meals. He also apologized for all of the issues. 
While this was going on I was watching the delivery driver on the \"track my order map\" online, drive in circles. Imagine the frustration of this...then Colina (located in Ahwatukee)one of our elementary sites calls and lets me know the delivery driver is there. 
Finally, after 3 hours the food was delivered to our district office. At this point we are just happy to see food, hot or cold we were all just hungry. I couldn't help but feel compassion for the driver who was deaf and had been driving around for who knows how long. I gave him a tip and thanked him. You could clearly see that he was upset and frustrated but was very apologetic for the confusion. 
Now you would think that it would be time to dig in...but funny thing is my salad was not in the bag...

Love ya Panera but your delivery system = Epic Fail : ("}
{"text":"I had a lunch catered recently and the quality of the food for the price is outstanding.  Super easy to order online and you get rewards to use later.   I had a billing issue and the store catering manager and regional manager were super responsive and helpful.  Cant wait to order again."}
{"text":"This Panera had good food when it first opened  and a peaceful friendly atmosphere. No more. Something is seriously wrong in the kitchen. The salad was disgusting -- limp iceberg lettuce swimming in a packaged dressing that tasted like mothballs. The tuna salad sandwich, which used to be excellent, had about 2 tablespoons of tuna in it. The bread was stale and most of the available tables were dirty. Too bad because I'm in the area often and would stop in, but I won't do that until I hear this place is under new management."}
{"text":"I haven't had great experiences at this location.  Issues varying from wrong order to pour service and bad food.  I will say I have had some ok experiences.  I love the coffee.  I love just ordering a pecan braid and a coffee on my phone and picking it up and walking out.  Overall the food and even the bakery has been subpar.  Most sandwiches and the occasional salad are much smaller than you get at other Panera stores.  Often the salads and sandwiches are just thrown together.  I'm not saying the employees need to dedicate their lives to making the best sandwich ever, but a little more care wouldn't hurt.  The ingredients are almost always of high quality and on the occasion I have stayed to eat and didn't like something they've been very nice and given me something else.  The problem I guess is that I get stuff to go.  Then I'm stuck.  

Bottom line some of the best coffee I've ever had.  At this point I come for the coffee and eat the food because I don't want to stop two places for lunch or breakfast."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, like any other Panera, but this particular location has supply chain problems.  About half the time I go they are out of what I order (Ciabatta bread, Cinnamon rolls, etc).  They also often forget to give me a pickle with my sandwich."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood to be living in but a TOTAL disappointment that Panera doesn't live up to a quality spot for breakfast or lunch. The staff could care less about the food and coffee products that are available. I'll give them this though...the place is spotless. Too bad the food is lacking. Sandwiches come out looking like they were dropped and smashed. Definitely no quality control. The unfriendly managers on staff always look frustrated and deturbed. Step it up Panera! Or let an Einstein bagel fill this spot."}
{"text":"This was really good food. The bread tasted fresh and the corn chowder was fantastic. My husband and I spent $21 on lunch and it wasn't a ton of food. I got a half sandwich and soup, and he got a whole sandwich with chips and a drink. They have good non soda drink choices. The staff was very nice."}
{"text":"Food had BUGS crawling in and around it!! SEE attached PICS! DO NOT recommend you go here!"}
{"text":"Never got the chance to eat or even order food because I slipped and fell in their bathroom when the automatic light did not come on. Corp (Travelers insurance) said they don't doubt that I fell and that I incurred bruising injuries to my back and arm ( and  a dry cleaning bill for a suit for what was ever on the floor) but they will not be held liable. Not liable because \"it has never been reported to have happened before\". What?! Did I hear them right. She agreed it happened, in their store, but they are not liable because I was the first? Crazy!!! They have lost a patron for life over a dry cleaning bill for a suit ($15). So if you choose to visit Panera Bread, please be cautious as you enter the restrooms and immediately report any lighting issues or you may find yourself staring at the ceiling while lying on your back in a puddle of God knows what!"}
{"text":"This Panera location is huge, spread out over two floors. I find this location far busier compared to the stores in the suburbs. This location appears to be a student hangout, probably from near by Ryerson - the crowd made me feel old!  This is a good spot to kill some time if your waiting for a movie to start across the street.

When I walked through the door, the line to order was about 10 people long but it moved fast. Service was efficient and the staff were very friendly. I feel bad for the staff who deliver you your food on the second floor - they are running up & down the stairs all day. The restaurant was very clean with staff consistently cleaning up after guests.

Food quality and selection is exactly the same as any other Panera with one exception, the bakery treat selection was much larger - fresh cookies, muffins, danishes, brownies and various other treats. All looked so good. A good stop to enjoy a coffee & treat if your shopping in the area.

If you like Panera, you will enjoy this location as well. If not, I doubt this location would change your opinion.

{"text":"Decided to have lunch outside office and was craving a soup. 

I must say, I was never so disappointed in service at this place as I did this time. All employees were so down and not so friendly. Place was not so busy and a lot of tables had dirty dishes on them so I couldn't choose to seat at them. 

I must of had high expectations for this place but this visit confirmd for me, it is just another overrated chain. 

Sorry PB."}
{"text":"I love panera already, but the employees at this location are super nice and always have big smiles on their faces. Also, I like that the manager is not above helping out the staff clear tables:)"}
{"text":"Quick service. Great menu. Healthy options. Lots of fresh breads and baked goods. I took my daughter and her friend for lunch. We had the Mac & cheese, grilled cheese & a combo with half a tuna sandwich with a half order of Mac & cheese. We were offered side of fresh fruit, fresh bread or chips. Once we place our order we were given a pager type thing and our order was brought to our table. Everything was very good. Service was amazing. For 3 of us to eat was $38. As we all know healthy choices are expensive but this was worth it"}
{"text":"Ok so i have order online or mobile a fee times. 2 times the have messed my order up. The first time the didn't put my mixed berry yogurt with my order. The manager comp me a cup of coffee. The next time the wrong sandwich was made or given. The place needs some real TLC. Not happy. So the lady taking care of me with the mixed up sandwich doesn't offer me anything. No apologies no comp coffee nothing. I have to ask for a comp coffee. Please learn some customer service or i will take my hard earned money to Starbucks!!!!! And another thing where is my spoon for my parfait????"}
{"text":"I am disappointed customer service is poor....the cashier is new so don't know the product right....i am vegan and unfortunately no soup and other menu choices :(......"}
{"text":"Because I was pregnant, I've waited anxiously for 10 months to eat a Bacon Turkey Bravo sandwich. I ordered one today and received a sub par sandwich. Instead of the amazing tomato bread I got plain rye. Instead of my favorite Gouda cheese I received American. The most amazing thing is that there is literally no bacon on my bacon turkey bravo sandwich. Wtf? I really hope that this specific Panera Bread is to blame as I would hate to stop eating at this restaurant all together."}
{"text":"Given the great location in Solon, I'm always underwhelmed by the food and experience here. I've never been the biggest fan of Panera (the menu choices keep rotating and going downhill overall), but there are plenty of Paneras I've been in that are managed well and that I would go back to, to eat and relax... This is just not one of them. Food is overpriced for quality but even more so when you add the uncleanliness of this place and poor service. I can just feel my impatience go up a notch when the apathetic staff behind the counter make me wonder if making me repeat myself is due to poor training, ignorance or laziness.  Overall, I avoid this place even if I'm craving a sandwich or their French onion soup. It's just not worth it.  On the other hand, the food is edible and won't kill you, so 2 stars it is."}
{"text":"I've never been that big of a Panera Bread fan.  I think it may be because there was so much hype when they first started building their cafes everywhere.  After the hype started dying off, and people use Panera Bread has a reliable staple in their life, I think I've come to like Panera Bread a bit more.  

So, to note, one of the biggest things to me in a chain restaurant is that it is consistent, whereever I go.  So, if I am states away from my home, I expect a good chain to be able to provide me the same good quality and flavors that I would find at home.  Service will always vary, and I get that, but the food has to somehow be the same.  Which is what hubby and I got from this particular branch.

I was feeling terrible because of, well, hormonal changes, and I needed something to calm my stomach down in some way.  I ordered the Mediterranean breakfast sandwich, while hubby ordered the ham/egg/cheese breakfast sandwich.  The cashier was VERY polite and was very apologetic when I was the one messing up on how to slide my own card (DAMN this stupid EMV chip thing that is redundant in the US versus Europe).  And the server that provided us our foods was very cool, quick, and made sure we had everything we wanted.

The food itself was what my stomach needed.  Hubby and I both did not have any major stomach issues later (read: gas and diarrhea), which is always a plus!  But, for the most part, the sandwiches were tasty, were not hard or weird or had any odd textures.  We got exactly what we ordered, and our stomachs were very pleased with the consistency of the foods even between the different states.

Clean tables, clean drink areas, and the bathrooms were clean/sanitary.

So, Panera Bread, thank you for being constant in your ways!  Your team at this specific branch did what they needed to do, and we'll visit another Panera Bread when we're near one."}
{"text":"Hawaii does not have a lot of Mac n Cheese places so I jump at the opportunity to eat it when I'm on the mainland. This white Mac n Cheese was hot and AWESOME!!! Definite 5! The bread was also good, another 5. The soup was very very good too but warm :( Which is why I couldn't give this place 5 stars :("}
{"text":"The food and staff are amazing foods always fresh and hot I love the lobster bisque can't go wrong with it"}
{"text":"I was disappointed in my sandwich that I had today. It contained so little meat that I could have sworn that the meat fell out of it. However the staff member (who was actually very nice and polite) informed me that that's how the breakfast sandwich was made. 

Panera should not be ripping off its customers with $4.50 breakfast sandwiches that contain like less than 1 oz of meat."}
{"text":"Both my wife and I had diarrhea within 1 hr of eating from this Panera location. The food tasted fine and the service was fast, and the sanitation rating was like 96.5 so not sure how it happened, but it did. Would have given 5* if we did not get diarrhea."}
{"text":"We come here every Sunday. Today I'm truly disappointed! The parking lot is very dirty, the coffee is cold & very weak, it's 8 AM. The bathroom is dirty, dirty toilets, walls are nasty, no soap & the water barely trickles out if the faucet. The tables in the dining room are dirty. The staff is friendly & the food is good. Management needs to step it up & clean this restaurant up."}
{"text":"We came here to eat while waiting for our car at NTB. Well its a nice location but I ordered a Pick 2 and got chicken noodle soup and a classic grilled cheese sandwich. The soup good and hot but the grilled cheese was basically two half pieces of bread with grill marks and a piece of cheese slapped between them. The bread was cold and the cheese not melted. Come on you cant call that a classic grilled cheese. Its a cheese sandwich cold. There was also a hair in both my husbands and my soup bowls. You pay so much for the food here and it basically came out like a five year old made it. I won't be visiting again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Love this location!  This is the largest Panara in the area so it can accommodate crowds---even during the lunch rush. Service is quick!  Dining area is huge (they also have separate areas that you can use for meetings).  They have a large parking lot as well (huge plus in Oakland).

Food and prices are comparable to other Parara's in the area.  It is a good deal for the quality of the food, friendliness of the staff and speed of preparation!"}
{"text":"We often order to-go from this establishment and not ONE time in the past two months have they gotten our order correct. Consistently not providing dressing and omitting multiple ingredients from the salads. The mac'n'cheese my kids love, but the bowls are usually half full. Staff repeatedly apologizes but issues remain. We will be frequenting other local establishments over this one moving forward."}
{"text":"The service is pretty bad here. I waited behind a family placing their order and they took a little bit of time finalizing their purchase. There was a young lady behind the register the entire time I waited and did not offer to assist me until she realized that the gentleman was taking a moment to complete his order. 

When waiting to pick up my order, the lady just packed the bag and set it on the counter. It was only me and the family waiting for food, since they had dine-in, I could only presume this bag was mine. I went to the counter and asked who's order it was. At that time she confirmed that the order was mine. 

I ordered soup. When able to eat the soup, it turns out that I was given pretty much all broth and no actual ingredients. Very disappointed in the level of service here."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Just make sure always order online so you can walk in, pick up your meal, then walk straight out again. Their salads are great value - really large and fresh and you can totally customize them when you order online. They have seasonal specials which are great also."}
{"text":"Staff was not familiar with newer menu items. Tried the turkey,apple and cheddar and it was a cold sandwich with two small pieces of turkey. I was unimpressed for the price of over 5 bucks for half of a sandwich. Maybe less money should be spent on commercials promoting new sandwich and more for more meat. Salad and soup were tasty as usual."}
{"text":"Love the drive-thru. For the most part, have been pleased with my experiences here. I do wish folks would be considerate and not order an extremely large order during peak hours. I have noticed the staff flustered and then the mistakes happen. I rather you take the extra seconds for accuracy."}
{"text":"It's a chain, but a damn friendly one, filled with soup and delicious sandwiches, topped off by hot coffee and free wi-fi.  Great spot.

However, just a word of warning.  If you're there to take a breather and collect yourself, avoid move-in week.  Stressed soccer moms with their soon to be inebriated freshmen children do not help keep one's sanity in the newly packed environment.

That said, great job, Panera for giving us grad students free wifi and great food.  Excellent."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to a good Panera sandwich so I walked over her from another concourse. Unfortunately it was very disappointing. Lots of employees but super slow. It took forever and there were a lot of people waiting. Maybe there was only one person in the kitchen? The sandwich then had very little toppings which is not the usual Panera way and missing tomatoes. This is my first Bad Panera experience. Usually Panera is very good in customizing orders, great sandwiches and great service."}
{"text":"My family and I came here after spending hours up on Mt. Charleston, playing in the snow. Coming into Panera Breads' warm and vibrant atmosphere was very welcoming. It was stylish and clean! The combo deals with their bread bowls are appreciatively affordable, and just what we needed that hit the spot. My one-year-old son enjoyed their whole apple side, that I cut into slices for him to eat. 

Their broccoli cheddar soup was very tasty, and one of the better ones I have eaten in my broccoli-cheddar-experiences. Definitely plan on ordering it again.

Also, this was my first time here. It's safe to say I will be a returning customer. :)

My only critique: I wish there was one closer to my house!"}
{"text":"Good food, decent service.  Never have I had an issue."}
{"text":"The food is good but not great. They like to skimp on the meat in  their sandwiches. It's as if it comes out of their paychecks if they portion it compared to the high price. As I walked in today there was a line of around 6-7 people and only 1 registrar open. Some one said something then they opened 2 more. I ordered a ham and swiss half sandwich with a cop of chick noodle soup.  I asked for no onion or tomato. They gave me nothing on the sandwich. Bread, meat and cheese is all I got. The part that really pissed me off was waiting almost 20 minutes for my food as the lady behind me who ordered about 6 sandwiches and a few other items got her food first. Why would you make the person who ordered first with 2 items total wait longer than a large order? Crap service with over priced food. Better portions would help"}
{"text":"Panera is one of my favorites! Always fresh and always delicious. They have a great variety of hearty and also healthy choices.  I'm at this location all the time and it's rare that I don't get excellent service. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. All of their soups are really good, but the tomato bisque is amazing! Mac & cheese is another favorite! If you're looking for something sweet, try the cinnamon crunch bagel (toasted). Sign up for a rewards card to earn free coffee and pastries."}
{"text":"This has gone way down since switching from Paradise Bakery the menu has changed for the worse, the company doesn't keep the interior up i.e. water running out of the ice machine. If you expect Paradise Bakery go elsewhere probably cheaper and much better food"}
{"text":"Needed a quick bite to eat and found myself driving by Panera Bread and figured I would try it. The restaurant is outside hill crest mall and used to be a Krispy Kreme many years ago. All re-modeled now, kind of a combination of a restaurant and coffee shop. They also have free wi-fi so there were a lot of students doing homework there. The menu is basically sandwiches, soup and salads. You order at the counter and they bring you the food to your table. Here's the good:

- They post the calories on the menu. I think this is fantastic and wish more places would do so. I changed what I was going to order when I noticed my chosen sandwich was 1,000 calories - crazy.
- Soups are good. I had a low fat black been soup which was very good... assuming you like black beans.
- My turkey sandwich was pretty good. They had a combo mayo / mustard spread that I enjoyed. The sandwich was made with rye bread and stuffed with turkey (it's processed meat though).
- My wife had the Turkey and cranberry panini which was rather good.
- You can get your soup in a bread bowl - I love eating my bowl after soup!
- The food came out fast.
- The restaurant was clean and so were the washrooms. Lot's of parking.

And the not so good...

- Didn't like the french onion soup - it's a poor imitation.
- I must admit, I don't get doing homework at restaurants. Although there were many tables, at least 3/4\"s were full of people there for free wifi. I can easily see  not getting a seat to eat during a busy time. 
- Not to contradict myself but the posted calories means I didn't get to eat  the sweets there - I felt too guilty.

I would go back for a quick bite. A location is opening in Markham by the whole Foods."}
{"text":"I love Panera Bread, but this location messes up my order every time. I won't be back. This last chance I gave them was a to go order of 2 Fuji apple chicken salads and 2 bread soup bowls. My kids love the apple salad because there are apple chips on top. When I got home, instead of apple chips, there were sliced real, bruised apples sliced and thrown on top. The salads come with a side. I chose bread for each. Big surprise.. no bread. The 2 bread bowls come with a side. I chose bread again. But of course, no sign of that bread either when I got home. I'm positive the manager filled the order because I sat there and waited for him to pack it up before I brought it home. I didn't check the bag before I left, figuring the manager would be certain my order was correct. Nope. I can understand forgetting to put sides of bread in, but replacing rotten apple slices because you have no apple chips! Really? And when the manager saw the salads, he KNEW it was incorrect and still handed it to me without saying anything?? Poor. This location is the worst, every time!! No excuse! Panera's upper management really should step in to get this locations act together!"}
{"text":"Incompetent Ghetto Staff! The staff messes up orders and talks loudly to their friends and coworkers throughout the restaurant. The staff also invites their friends and gives them free meals which I do not care but when the staff keeps persistently coming back to the tables with their friends eating free they proceed to talk loudly and act very ghetto, disrupting paying guests. 
Since when is it okay to go back and forth between eating with your friends and waiting on customers without washing your hands in between. How about management telling their employees to exercise some class and cleanliness. Bathroom was disguisting."}
{"text":"Panera is great! Asiago steak sandwich was a great dinner! You can swap a side of chips for a baguette. Yum! The baguette I got was warm!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love the fresh and healthy food Panera offers, but also sometimes you need to indulge, and they've got the goods on that front as well. (I'm looking at you, Everything Bagel.) And rapid pick-up is so super convenient.
I'm 3-starring instead of 4 only because I've had a couple experiences where the bagel I've requested was sold out, and while my wait time was still cut by ordering online, I still had to go to the counter and wait. No biggie, but I was told the problem is that they just aren't tracking inventory like they should.
In other news, I've been a fairly longtime fan of the Greek Salad with Chicken. Anyone else miss the switch to pickled red onion as the standard? I sure did, but I'm thrilled with the change. So refreshing!
The wait at this location in general is long, and I can't really figure out why because there seem to be plants of workers.
All in all, I'm still frequenting this location a few times a month. The food is good and they always get my order right."}
{"text":"Great location and friendly staff - keep up the welcoming, positive attitude. Three stars because the quality of the salad ingredients was not as expected. Some of the greens were wilty / soggy looking instead of vibrant green - when I get salads they really need to look and taste fresh - especially when Panera is now all about clean, fresh ingredients. I usually substitute chicken with turkey and oddly get two very different types so turkeys. Sometimes I get a delicious roasted all white meat turkey breast and other times I get what looks to be rolls of deli turkey meat. Really prefer the taste and texture of the former and not the deli turkey version - the lack of consistency is both surprising and confusing."}
{"text":"Customer service from the counter staff is not good at all.  Young girl working at the front counter on Sunday morning on dec 22 had worst attitude.
Need to get Better people behind the counters."}
{"text":"i was so... confused. 

ok, i come from the land of lines. LA has lines for everything: lines for clubs, lines for fancy restaurants, lines for the line to get into the club. THOSE lines had some sort of signage or someone telling me where to get in line and shutup. i'm ok with that. i'm great with following directions. IKEA and i get along immensely because of this. but this place..... this place just assumed i'd know what the hell to do. i found the big line, stepped in, and realized that there were no menus to handle which is fine. i can read boards. but i was confused by the whole 'order at this station, then order at this station, but wait you get your food now at one station but not at another thing, and here i am going to give you this piece of paper with some writing on it but you dont have to hand to anyone'. what.. the... hell.

i managed to bungle my way through the line, profusely apologizing for acting like a moron and not knowing what to order where or that i wasnt supposed to hand them my to go paper. everyone was pretty friendly, but they definitely stared at me like i was an amateur.

food was pretty decent. i had the turkey cranberry half sammich with the southwestern chicken caesar. all in all a solid meal and i loved the bread on the sammich. the cookie was great too, very soft and chocolately. 

now that i kinda know the ropes, i might come back, but damn i hope i dont need a map next time."}
{"text":"I come here often for a space for work/studying. There is always an available seat- evening during peak hours. Employees are always friendly and tables are usually clean (not always). I always order a hot drink while here- can't always guarantee it'll be piping hot. 
For those who are gluten free, they have a gluten free menu online that is very helpful. Some of the salads that are not gluten free are only so because of croutons- ask for without and you're good to go."}
{"text":"I ordered food for Delivery at around 10AM so it could be delivered at 1230-1245 because I have to go to lunch by 1pm. . Not only were they 30 min late, I didn't even get a courtesy call about the tardiness. I know you may be understaffed or busy, but for being in customer service for over 20 yrs I would have called them to let them know I was running late. Or gave them a discount or something for being late. If I would have got a call it would have been better. I have to take lunch at a certain time and I had to eat quickly. I also tried calling several times and it was busy each time. I probably will not be ordering from here again. This would have been 1 star but the food was good."}
{"text":"Worst Panera ever: waited 30 minutes and food still was not delivered to table. Had to cancel order and leave. Nice seating area but kitchen can definitely not handle the volume during peak hours. Limited parking and long waits."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this location serves you ice cold meals. I will not be returning had I known my meal would feel like I'm biting into ice cubes when I order through the drive thru then I would have had them remake it or either that get my money back. My husband and I love Panera but the last few times we should have learned our lesson and not returned for the sake of spending $10 on the nastiness sandwich I've ever tasted. Coming from a woman who was hungry and looking forward to eating her expensive \"fresh\" sandwich complete let down threw it directly in the trash. It will be no surprise when this location is closed down for serving people everything but fresh food. That is all."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! I have tried this panera 2 times, the first time I got the green goddess salad. The lettuces was wilted and several brown pieces and the dressing was bland. The second time I went I got a turkey, bacon and avocado sandwich. There was avocado on only 1 half of the sandwich and it was ROCK hard. I have never had rock hard avocado before so that was odd. The turkey was extremely dry. Both times I went in the staff was not very friendly and extremely rushed. My sandwich was suppose to come with chips as a meal thing and they didn't not provide them. I noticed once I got to my car, when you are paying over $9 for a sandwich  and chips you should be provided the chips. Any who I do not recommend them, I miss Paradise (as that is what this used to be)"}
{"text":"Standard Panera location. Solid service, quick to receive my food. Food was correct, and hot. Warm cookies were relish!  Tables were a bit dirty but thats really the only negative. Nice job Panera!"}
{"text":"If you haven't had panera before, you might be missing out. This panera in particular is in an awkward location, but it's near all of the busiest spots on the west side of Mississauga. Everything you've had at artisano you can get here, prices are comparable, and they serve breakfast all day. On top of their selection of bakery items and egg soufflés for breakfast, lunch and dinner open up a whole world to be discovered including soups salads, artisan dishes and now noodle and protein bowls. Anytime you buy a meal, you can get any bakery item for about 1.50$ with tax. I've had it all from a pick two to per indulging on mac and cheese or a bread bowl for some serious broccoli cheddar soup. Their teas are known for being perfect and their coffee (especially their hazelnut blend) is perfect black. On top of that, they are entirely dog friendly, you can bring them on the patio!"}
{"text":"Normally it's super good but the last three times I've been the service has been terrible and messed up my orders, they run out of bread and cookies. The workers attitudes are ridiculous. Not going back. At least to that Panera's"}
{"text":"This place always messes up my order. And never give me a free bakery item in return."}
{"text":"I can't believe that panera bread gave me a bad experience!!! For a while I have been buying lunch from panera bread and ever since yesterday night I am not going to be back ! 

I went to grab dinner around 9 an hour before closing on a Friday. I walked inside and they seem to be getting ready to close, I asked the cashier which pasta would have tomato sauce and she insisted that the pesto pasta would have tomato sauce , and I thought that was slightly odd because I mean it's named pesto for a reason.. I even asked a couple of times if she was SURE it has tomato sauce. She said \"YES!!! Red sauce as in TOMATO sauce !! \" so I believed her ... 

And I also ordered some flatbread that came with the pick 2,I asked for only the BBQ flatbread to be toasted but guess what ?? They toasted the wrong flat bread. Plus the flat bread was still cold!!!! 

So.. Little did I know,being told by the cashier the pasta was made with tomato sauce. I was so surprised when I got home nearly wanted to go back to panera bread and yell at her for giving me the wrong info!! Once I opened the pasta container I was devastated about the amount they gave for the price I paid!!!!!!
Not only did it come in small portion, it looked terrible and tasted cold and oiled out...  
 I also got a soft roll (type of bun) that comes with it and man oh man .. How could they not give you butter !!!! I mean they gave me a knife and fork but for what reason would I need a butter knife without the butter ....... 

I literally paid $27 for this crappy  dinner where as I could've eaten somewhere even better..  
 

You know what, maybe it's because it's almost time to close at 10pm!!! But cmon ...this is not how it's supposed to be !!!"}
{"text":"This location just opened in September 2015, and it's a very much needed addition to what used to be an intersection with few options for a bite to eat!!

The food is delicious and really reasonably priced! I definitely suggest the Rapid Pick-Up ordering option online for a nearly stress free experience. You can just walk in, grab your food and go (or sit down if you can find a spot). They mark your food order on the receipt in super large letters so there is no confusion, but there's a staff member at the pick-up window to assist with orders. The staff is very friendly! 

Because it's so closely located to a few other newly opened quick-bite options in a very busy executive office location, this place is EXTREMELY busy between 11:45am-1pm during the work week, so go before or after that time frame to get your food in a timely fashion.

The cons are few: Extremely limited parking and the \"flow\" of this Panera location isn't the best. You pick up your order in the back of the restaurant, almost where you'd think bathrooms would be, and then you weave your way back to the front to exit."}
{"text":"This is pretty much like any other Panera. Food is good and service is prompt but as always their price are a bit high for a soup and salad. This Panera is relatively large and if you are looking to dine in there is usually an abundance of seating. It's never too loud so you can easily have a meeting or get some work done here. As always take out at any Panera is easy and convenient. If pressed for time or have a very complicated order recommend ordering ahead for rapid pickup!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from St Louis, so I understand why I couldn't find St. Louis Bread Co...

I love the pecan rolls and coffee oh and wifi to read news. Place is very clean, I think the girl taking order was stressed that day. But no biggie I got my food fast and coffee was hot so no complaints."}
{"text":"Honestly, I have experienced better.  Most of the menu was blocked off.  I wasn't sure if its because they didn't have it or didn't want to make it.  I got a salad that was mediocre.  My friend got a sandwich that was supposed to have chicken on it.  He barely got 3 pieces on it!  If we are paying 5-7 dollars for a plate of food (and additional for chicken,) I would at least expect we get what we paid for.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Long lines makes this Panera Bread an unattractive place to eat.  On a busy Saturday, the restaurant only had 1 check stand open.  The Restsurant finally opened a second check stand, but it really needed a third check stand.  The manager really needs to be more on top of it!  Otherwise, the food and atmosphere are pretty good and the servers are efficient."}
{"text":"Great place to do work, drink coffee, and eat decent food."}
{"text":"Ooh, this Panera uses some sort of pager system where they bring your food to your table! I felt fancy. And special. And catered to. So of course I was a happy customer! The shape of this store is a little wonky so the seating area feels like a maze, but I found a cozy little booth and enjoyed my salad very much. The food is no different from any other Panera, so I won't comment on that. Parking is a beast sometimes, especially around lunch on a weekday."}
{"text":"Updated review.. I noticed employees cleaning in areas that were left unclean before. The Internet connection is better. Much better. And it felt good to try some fresh muffin samples. Thanks 4 listening."}
{"text":"The food is good and service was pleasant. I like that the person bringing your food is also keeping tables neat and clean. Minus one star because my soup was like warm."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here after the gym. Good food good atmosphere. I like the broccoli bowl and their sandwiches are very good."}
{"text":"I've increased my rating from a 4 to a 5 after coming here regularly since September. The employees are kind, attentive and add to the experience. I'm partial to the night time staff. Daytime staff is also good. Never been here in the morning.

This location is very busy at lunchtime. Once the lunchtime rush is over, the customers come in waves. I can't speak to what it's like in the morning.

The food is always good and served quickly. With a MyPanera card you receive free food/drink or discounts after every 8 visits. There is free WiFi, plenty of seating, a good mix of music and it's just a nice place to eat, have something to drink(no alcohol) and spend some time. It's really nice having a Panera in my part of town.

I like Panera in general and I especially like this location."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I use the app to try and place A delivery order. Upon making my food selections and placing the order I realize that I had placed it for rapid pick up. I tried to contact the store of which the message that answered the phone indicated if you were calling between X hour and ask our obviously stating they're busy. lunch and dinner you may not receive an answer try back later so I tried the 800 number and received a young gentleman over the phone who said he had a private number he could contact he came back to the phone and indicated he too had received no answer the disappointing part is when IArrived at the store to pick up my order or three tables up to in the dining room the manager standing in the corner speaking to an employee who was in street clothes to other employees who appeared to be doing nothing I will not return to the store"}
{"text":"Love having lunch there. Especially with lovely company of my own or my loves. Steak and white cheddar panini is amazing. Chicken chipotle avocade sandwich is tasty!. Drink are so refreshing forget soda and it loads of sugar +caffeine."}
{"text":"I generally enjoy Panera's salads, but I had a bad experience here the other day with a take-out salad. I ordered the Chopped Chicken Thai salad.  

I did not discover until I got home that they completely left the chicken off my salad!!   Super disappointing! 

This Panera needs to do a better job making sure orders are correct before sending them out the door."}
{"text":"Don't even try the drive thru, there is no one staffing it and if you're like me, you will drive away after waiting for 10 mn for someone to take your order. This location is a sad joke."}
{"text":"Wow, it's getting hard to get out of this new plaza quickly. Amazing LCBO, Whole Foods and now a Panera Bread recently added. Five guy burgers also coming soon. Enough about the the new plaza and on to Panera Bread... 

Service is very good, the staff took the time to explain menu items and make recommendations. The restaurant / cafe looks small from the outside but is actually very large inside. They have my favourite - SOUP IN A BREAD BOWL. What is better than having soup and eating the bowl! I made the mistake of ordering a sandwich with the soup / bread bowl combo and this was way to much food. I tried a few soups on a couple visits and they were all good. The bread bowl is made out of sourdough bread - also my fav.

The sandwich was merely average. Ingredients were all fresh but I suspect the meat was previously frozen and processed. I would skip this next time and stick with my soup bread bowl. 

Some of the baked goods look interesting but I didn't try any this visit. Like other locations, there is free wi-fi but I found it a little slow on my i-phone. 

Huge bonus for listing the calories right on the main menu."}
{"text":"This took over Paradise Bakery. The food which consists of sandwiches, soups, salads, pastas, and bakery items is fresh and full of flavor. Because of the fresh ingredients it is a little pricey for fast causal but worth it. I love the modern ambience that is very warm and inviting. Make sure to always get one of their amazing bakery items with your meal!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the staff are friendly, and the atmosphere is warm. They even have an allergy guide and are cautious about handling food when it comes to serving people with serious allergies. Overall, it is very deserving of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"So happy this changed over to Panera! I have missed this place, since it seemed to me more of a Midwest place until now. I am thrilled to be able to eat my Panera favorites again.

Ordering is an awesome experience. You can go to the counter and order with an associate, or you can avoid lines and go to one of the 6 computer ordering stations and take care of yourself! You can still customize the order any way you want and the process is very straightforward. I can see how some people wouldn't prefer that, but both options are there.

I don't feel like I even have to comment on the food. AMAZING! And reasonably priced as well. I used to go to Einstein more frequently, but now it's Panera every time because it's such a better value. And the lady at the register said they retained some of the Paradise favorites on the Panera menu. 

Join the free rewards program and get a card. With it, you get a free coffee or soda every time you go in. I don't know how long that promotion is valid, but it has been available every visit so far. 

Enjoy! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Service was good and food was good. Restaurant was clean. Only gave 4 stars due to cost portion ratio. Sandwiches are a bit small for the price. I ordered the whole and it seemed about the size of a half from paradise bakery."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my wife and daughter. Food was good and customer service was good. Will definitely return next time I'm in the area if it hasn't changed to a panera bread by then."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and the services was good. The staff cared about the place as they took care of the the tables. They were friendly as well."}
{"text":"I find panera generally expensive. Pasta is a great introduction! This locations manager is really nice! Atleast the one around when I went."}
{"text":"I always liked Panera bread. When I got hired here awhile back I was so excited!!! Before I begin my experience I just want to start by saying I am a type one diabetic. One night while I was serving my blood sugar went down to 38 (dangerously low blood sugar)and supervisor (angelica I think her name was) got extremely angry that I had to sit down and take care of my health and the next day I came in and she fired me...toldme I wasn't allowed to leave the managers office until I signed a paper and told me that if she knew I was diabetic I never even would've been a consideration as an candidate for an employee."}
{"text":"The customer service at this Panera is the very best.  Both my husband and I are combat veterans and mentioned this when we ordered and we were surprised by the lovely lady at the register who gave us our meal on the house.  Thank you for taking the time to recognize our service to our country with this wonderful meal.  We thoroughly enjoyed the food and will most definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I used to love Panera. I still love that I can come here to study or think...BUT the food has gone way downhill. I know it's all prepackaged and they basically heat it up. I did not know that soup could be messed up, but this visit proved me wrong. Midway through my meal, I looked over and saw a young staff member digging silverware out of the trashcan without gloves. I hope she doesn't work in the kitchen. Avoid this location if you plan to eat."}
{"text":"It was great when it was Paradise Bakery, but now it's even better as Panera! I can use my rewards card finally! The whole process of ordering was so efficient; you can get in line and wait (they had plenty of cashiers at lunch rush the two times I went) or order on a tablet with your credit card. Then, your order is placed on a screen so you can see if it is being made or finished/ready to pick up. Finally, there are cubbies with letters for orders already filled to go in. The soda machine was a bit hard to find the first time and is a bit cramped, but no big deal. I'll be happy to keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from this Panera and have been to it many times. It has NOT been because of the service by any stretch of the imagination. Time and time again the food has always been as what is expected of a Panera or Paradise. Thus the reason we go here. That said time and time again the service has been sub par at best. Service comes from management and management stems from leadership. Where there are no leaders the people suffer. Employees and customers alike. PLEASE work on your leadership and management at this location. There is no question that customer service can change but sometimes you have to lop off the branches that don't produce a harvest."}
{"text":"This Panera would have gotten 5 stars a few years ago when I practically lived there the month I was finishing up my grad school portfolio. But those lovely leather armchairs that I so loved so sit with a drink and a pastry are now gone. Lounging around all day is no longer encouraged, it would seem.

That being said, this Panera is still a pretty great one. Quick service, friendly faces, always clean. You really can't go wrong with soup in a bread bowl."}
{"text":"As I'm sitting at my table during the dinner rush, all I can hear is the manager screaming names on orders and demanding things from his kitchen. The problem is there are table feet from him that are probably deaf by now.

The second problem is that they ran out of French baguettes again. Yes, again. Not my first rodeo at this panera and probably not my last. Luckily I was early enough to get one of the last ones tonight.

The food is standard but the service leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"It's Panera Bread.  It's a staple for anyone who has an informal business meeting or needs a place for prolonged studying.  The coffee will give you jitters (free refills in house) and the bread (not pastries) are fresh.

Like most Yelpers, it comes with a bit of guilt going to a non-\"Mom & Pop\" place.  Please someone open a Panera Bread like place near Brooklyn, OH.  I need a place where I can study with a big mug of coffee and not freeze my bottom off."}
{"text":"One afternoon, I went to Panera to study and purchased a hot tea. The lady who served me appeared to be annoyed at the amount of customers as she was working the food register and the bakery/hot drink register. I had to ask her where to find the hot water and tea bags as  I had not previously purchased tea or coffee at Panera. They did have a nice selection of tea flavors and had honey, lemon, and sugar packets as additional options. 

I sat in a booth in the general dining area facing away from the door to reduce distractions as I studied. A lady with a child and her mother were sitting a couple tables away from me and the child was so loud, I could hear him through my headphones. He remained that way for 15-30 minutes without the adults attempting to make him be quiet and respect the dining experience of the guests around them. In addition to the noise, the booth I sat in had remnants of the guests before me, to the point that the contents were sticking to the table.Simply wiping them off with a napkin was not an option. As I as leaving, I went to the restroom and found the toilet full of toilet paper with additional toilet paper flowing out of the holder. I was not impressed with the cleanliness or tidiness of the restroom or restaurant.  

My experience was so-so and could have been improved if there were more employees, friendly employees, serving guests at registers, cleaning the tables and cleaning the restrooms. Despite enjoying most of the food options and combinations, my husband and I do not go here for lunch or dinner due to the high prices compared to the quality of food. However, despite the lack of cleanliness and noise level, I may return for a drink or bagel in the future."}
{"text":"I use to eat at Panera back east and it was ok for lunch. Something must have happened but this chain has really gone not downhill but off the Clift. My spouse and I ordered a sandwich called turkey with carmalized onions and spinach. The turkey was some sort of rubberized boiled meat. Describing it as meat is stretching it. In addition to add insult to injury the \"sandwiches\" were tiny and cost $10 each. There are much better places in the area."}
{"text":"Cold soup and absolutely filthy conditions - those are really the highlights.  

I will say that the food here is usually above average, but this particular location is entirely skippable.  If you do try it, get it \"to go\" because you'll stick to the seats if you don't.  Unless your kitchen at home is dirtier, then feel free to enjoy the slime here.

Also, if it's helpful, there are no functioning highchairs when we visited."}
{"text":"I went through the drive through because it was raining and I was in the drive thru for over 20 mins waiting. The only reason you have a drive thru is to make the ordering and receiving process quicker and easier for people and that is definitely not the case here. Next time I'll bear the rain and go inside or go through someone else's drive thru. PSA: if you see more than 3 cars in the drive thru just go inside!!!"}
{"text":"Despite what I've heard people say, I think the staff are very competent. They have never gotten my order wrong, and I've been going here for years. The food is delicious. I usually get the you pick two with soup and a flatbread, and the scones I've had a few times were great, too. On weekends during lunch time, it can be a little crowded, but the food is still ready in a timely fashion."}
{"text":"Love Panera.  Was at this location this morning and Davy on helped us.  He was warm and inviting and his smile made me happy.  Good on you Panera for hiring such happy, friendly help."}
{"text":"I wish I could leave a one star review every time I came here. It's truly the worst Panera I've ever been ever anywhere, CONSISTENTLY."}
{"text":"Zachary & Amanda are excellent cashiers with the utmost amount of professionalism and customer service! They need to be promoted or at least given a raise.  Most unfortunately,  we had the opportunity to observe your \"shift manager\" in action and if I was you I would strongly rethink having her as an employee let alone \"shift manager!\" Amanda ran out of dollar bills and quarters she requested assistance to be replenished and your \"shift manager\" slammed the money down without uttering a word and stormed off! She also delivered my food while I dined outside she dropped it off without a word.  Otherwise your food was exactly what was expected regarding quality.  I would make this a 5  if the \"shift manager\" wasn't here."}
{"text":"I use to get the Cuban sandwich, was my favorite, but they discontinued it. Now I try the different sandwiches, so it's a good change I suppose.
Today I tried the new southwest flatbread. Pretty good. A little too much refried beans for my taste, it dried out the sandwich a little. Overall good flavor."}
{"text":"This location seriously needs to train it's staff some customer service skills!!  We have been to this location twice & both times have been horrible.  The employees seem like they don't even want to be there, are rude, & not helpful.  When you asked them for something, they seemed put out to get it.

Cleanliness & stocked items at the drink area were sub-par too.  Today we went there at 2:00, which was past the lunch rush so not too busy, and the place was filthy.  There was a 1/2 sandwich on the floor right next to my chair, the garbage cans were overflowing, the bathroom was gross, and the drink area was out of drink lids & totally messy!  They were also out of mango tea which seemed like forever to brew more.  

Bottom line:  this location needs some serious help!!!"}
{"text":"Go to Starbucks..go anywhere but here. The last two times I was there I waited a minimum of ten minutes to order while the employees (manager included) stood there and goofed around and ignored me. The last time I was there I ended up leaving after standing there for 15 minutes with nothing. I usually have good experiences at Panera but I would avoid this one."}
{"text":"A bit dirty; tables, floor....services is dismal....very disorganized. District Manager should check in on their staff b/c I am sure this place is below company mission standards."}
{"text":"So glad to see Panera in Canada! They're  staple when I'm state side--wish we had them in Québec :(

A little on the pricy side and the servers all seemed to hate life and/or just want to go home...30 mins from closing, so I understand a little, but being polite wouldn't hurt."}
{"text":"Their chippers  are so amazing. ! Best cookies I've had. Less than half the price of mrs fields cookies"}
{"text":"The food is Soooooo good here! A little pricey but definitely worth it. Just the smell alone when you walk in makes you want to come back for more"}
{"text":"The food is good, the atmosphere can be quite loud and busy (but not their fault of course), but my 1 star is based on the customer service. I often get the cheddar broccoli coup, and it had come in an portion that was less than usual, which I noticed as I get this soup all the time. The soup already comes in a bowl that tapers greatly towards the bottom, so it was a significant amount, especially when you pay over $7 for a soup. Unfortunately, when I asked one of the staff if they would be able to fill it up to the the amount that it is usually filled to, the lady woking there was just like \"No that looks like the regular portion we give\" I was surprised -- even if it was the regular portion (which I did not believe it to be based on getting this soup a million times), would it really be a big deal to put more soup? It's unfortunate because the other staff there seem great, besides this one lady who I interacted with. It's just strange that Panera (or at least this one staff member) would be so stingy about the soup after charging fairly high prices for their food."}
{"text":"Saturday nite, and craving some Tomato Basil from Paradise Bakery. Wait! It's now called what? 

It's now called Panera Bread. Love the decor, similar menu, helpful staff.

The prices and portions have changed. Oh my! The soup was half filled, and salad was ... well, 3 slivers of chicken, 1 onion string, 10 pieces romaine lettuce bout the size of a quarter, and the rest were croutons.

Sad Panda ;("}
{"text":"Like the self ordering. The salads were fresh especially the Mediterranean chicken with quinoa. My daughter described it was fresh like it was picked from a garden. The only down side was there were a lot of dirty tables not wiped down."}
{"text":"I love panera, but not particularly this location. It's better than dealing with Boca Park, though. I only get pick up from here, but they have only ever got my (picky) order wrong once, and of course corrected it. I love the new BBQ chicken flatbread, it has spinach, chicken, BBQ sauce, and crispy onions. One half is good for me, but my boyfriend usually gets two different flatbreads. They also have 99c pastries!"}
{"text":"Please bring back Paradise. 
They ran out of their tomato basil bread which is the best part of the Mediterranean veggie sandwich. The sandwich I ended up with has all the ingredients dumped in the middle of the bread and no where else. I had to spread everything evenly out when I got home. 
Also, do you not get a free cookie anymore? Or did they just forget to give me mine? 
The mac and cheese is thankfully, still delicious."}
{"text":"This place has really nice atmosphere during the weekend. I usually get half a frontega chicken pannini and half a cesaer salad.. and it always comes out perfect and delicious. This is my go to place for a quick sit down lunch."}
{"text":"Tonight is the second time I've been to Panera. Staff remains unfamiliar with the products. I was in the drive-thru and this occurred:

Me: Do you have a loaf of Asiago cheese bread?
Them: Do you mean a bagel?
Me: Nope. A loaf of bread.
Them: Do you mean a demi?
Me: What's that? 
Them: The same thing. 
Me: The same thing?
Them: Yes.
Me: The same thing as what I just asked for?
Them: No, we're sold out.
Me: Sold out of what?
Them: The asiago.
Me: But you just said... uhhh, I'll drive around. 

Me at the window: Were you joking?
Them: About what?

I ended up asking for the manager. Joe came to the window but he just wasn't inclined to listen rather, he cut me off to praise his great employee. So here ya go, Joe, she may be a lovely young woman but she needs and deserves more training. 
I love the concept of the place, and was looking forward to having a local spot but it's difficult to buy something when the process seems like a bad comedy routine."}
{"text":"Nice place, very clean looking. Nice sized, well stocked drinks wide selection of drinks, sandwiches and soups as well as sweets and coffee

Had the pick two special, if it wasn't so tasty i would have took off two stars for unarmed robbery. 

Mediterranean Veggie Sandwich
+ the bread isn't toasted so it's oil free making it more fat free then your fat free  
+tasty 
-menu said it used roasted bell peppers when i read that i assumed strips of roasted red bell pepper it's more like chopped up cubes of bell pepper didn't provide much flavor
-wasn't a lot of feta cheese
- a dust of garlic powder would have improved flavor a bit but that's cause i dust all my sandwiches with it

Cream of Tomato Soup
+ very very nice with the sandwich
+ sweet and tangy
- some unknown flavor i couldn't identify

Overall
Be careful what you buy here, if you're drawn by their advertisements of fat free or low calorie or what ever order something you know is low in fat and this defeats the purpose but ask them to not grill or press the sandwich they lube with oil and that's fat."}
{"text":"Excellent Panera location. Much fancier furnishings than most and the staff were particularly chatty and friendly. Fast service and yummy food. Win win win."}
{"text":"Very fresh food and the pastries look to good to pass up. The service is excellent from the time you place an order to when you are finished as your table gets cleared. Gets busy during lunch. Would give it a 5 but it's still a little pricey especially if you go often."}
{"text":"So I've eaten sandwiches all over the place and Panera came highly recommended.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but the sandwich I had was just subpar.  I ate their classic chicken salad which had ok flavors .  The apple they provided was somewhat soft which definitely didn't help.  I also had a chocolate chip cookie from their bakery  which could have been better.  The bread for the sandwich was very good, but other than that I would recommend Dean & Delluca or another sandwich shop over this."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to eat a cheap lunch or do some work online. It's clean and the wifi is free, both of which are pluses. However, the coffee is rarely fresh (today's was brewed two hours before I arrived, and then ran out), outlets are hard to come by, and it's iffy as to whether your food order will be correct (my family has a 0% success rate in regards to getting correct dressings/cream cheeses/sides). I wouldn't come here if you're in a hurry, but it's not a terrible option if you want a relaxed environment."}
{"text":"The soup was pretty good and they serve the soup in huge bowls now, so you are getting a decent, filling lunch for about 6 bucks. Unfortunately, all the soup arrives to the store in a can or a bag, so this soup can never vault past three stars. My choice was the creamy chicken and wild rice with white meat chicken (after manager checked the ingredients on the can). This soup was better tasting than the broccoli cheddar version which also was ordered. Both soups came with a small hunk of sourdough bread. We also tried a cherry pastry which had a surprise cream cheese filling, but otherwise was unremarkable. I would guess nothing is made in this store - too big of a chain to do that stuff."}
{"text":"I know many of you will not like my review but here goes anyway.

If I was to wake up in the morning and need a cup of coffee and a tasty bagel, this would be a good place to head to. They have WiFi and newspapers. Nice couch type are for lounging. They have all the toppings for the perfect morning.

We however, had lunch here. I have also had dinner in the past. The menu is quite confusing. They have many sandwiches with great names and great breads but, what the heck comes on them? My wife asked about three before she just described what she was looking for. They told her a choice that was closest and they went from there. Add this, take away that. Much easier if you list it out. 

Bread is great! Lettuce and tomato were old. Some of the lettuce was wilted. I will tell you that if you look down on a sandwich and you see wilted lettuce before you even start, just give it back and get your money, unless your starving.

When you walk in there is one register to the left and four on the right. We were greeted with a \"welcome etc etc\" but after that the employees kept working behind the counter. Took them a minute or two to realize one of them had to take the order. That is an auto \"BOOOOOO\" when I seem like I'm bothering you. Pretty sure you're in business to make and sell food.

There were no clean tables when we went to sit down. That is another problem. If you are a busy lunch food spot and it is lunchtime, you need to be \"Johnny on the spot\" with the cleaning tables.

They did have a great little baker program for kids. Sign your kids up and they can take the class to learn and actually bake bread. Class looked to full for me though. 20 some kids seemed big. 

To recap:

breakfast 5 stars
bread 4 stars
lunch 2 stars
staff 1 star
menu 0 stars
kids group looked cool but I didn't pay that much attention."}
{"text":"Panera bread is a nice place for breakfast or for a nice healthy lunch. I love their you pick 2 option because i get to have a soup and half a sandwich which is perfect combination! my favorite is the creamy tomato soup. I think that they have amazing bagels as well ! it would definitely be the place to go whenever i want a bagel."}
{"text":"Was here on an impromptu visit with my girl who has never been. I used to frequent the one in Richmond Hill back when i used to work there and this one is the closest. We came on a Wednesday night and there was no lineup but quite a few people inside the seating area. I got the pick two, which was the mac and cheese with a tomato soup. I got a hot chocolate with it and a cookie for 99 cents. It came up to a whopping  16 bucks but panera is not a cheap chain. We sat down waiting for our meal as they serve it to you. It took a bit of time but luckily i wasn't starving. They forgot my hot chocolate but promptly brought it. It was ok. A bit salty, no croutons in my soup that i love and they even asked me if i wanted to put them in. I think the location in Richmond Hill is better. The hot chocolate wasn't too bad though and not overly sweet. I may go back to this location but not out of my way. 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"If you have any experience with Panera, this one is a nice example. No problems with the service or the food, and it's easy to get the nutritional information. I have had a few issues trying to get the wifi to work.
One time I left something behind there, and they kept it safe until I returned an hour later. So praise for them on that rare but valued service."}
{"text":"Used to visit here more in the past then I do now. Food and service have always been good to me so I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Huge selection. Always nice and friendly. I wish they delivered it to our office but it's more like catering for 10 or more people.  The salads are good and a big size. We all ended up taking stuff home from lunch ;). Good food!"}
{"text":"Much like Target, Don't go here after you have been to the original chain across the border. I came here before work for a small snack and wi-fi. I got the pick two with Mac and Cheese and Roasted Turkey and Avocado Sandwich. I was expecting larger portions, as I fondly remembered my meal at a Clearwater Panera, where I took half the salad and half the sandwich home.... This was not the case. The Mac and Cheese was in a sad small bowl and was very watery and the sandwich was also anemically sized.... I would come back for Wi-Fi and a coffee and maybe a cookie, but not for any kind of meal."}
{"text":"I cannot understand how this location is always busy. For a chain restaurant, the quality isn't bad but it's not a place to go out of my way to visit. BF's craving for soup prompts most of our visits.

Their pick-two lunch specials are a good value: pair anything with their white cheddar steak sandwich and you're pretty much guaranteed at least a half-way satisfying meal. The bread bowls are a huge, carby indulgence, well-priced at $6- best with either the clam chowder or the broccoli cheddar. 

Service is okay. Line seems to move slowly, and it's nice that they use the GPS beepers to bring the meal out to your exact table, but several tables go dirty after patrons clear their trash and leave- the place is set up to encourage people bussing their own tables, but they should still have staff around wiping down, and I didn't see this happening. Makes for few seating options after a rush."}
{"text":"Got the Fuji Apple Chicken salad at Panera bread ... usually love their salads but I spent most of my lunch picking out nasty brown lettuce from the salad ... I'm not picky and don't usually complain but I was starving and it was pretty gross. I went to the counter and told them about the nasty brown lettuce and how I hope they don't serve this to any other customers ... she seemed to not care at all that my salad was brown and wilted. Only offered to pack up the remainder of my salad in a to-go box and \"add\" a little more green mix lettuce. Wow, way to do the bare minimum and not really care about customers who usually love the brand and food. Less than impressed!"}
{"text":"Standard panera fare. Descent. Servoce is lacking a bit. Had a good cinnamon roll and a cup of cappuccino. The cinnamon roll could have been warmed up and the cappuccino is okay."}
{"text":"I ordered a half green Chile lime chicken salad and small Mac and cheese without specifying that I wanted the \"you pick 2\" deal. My total was $13 something. When I asked \"that is your you pick 2 deal??\", the response was \"did you want the you pick 2\"? And I responded \"yes, isn't that what a you pick 2 is? A half salad and small Mac and cheese?\" So apparently you have to tell them your order is a you pick 2, even though they should be able to figure that out. First fail (although they did adjust the price so my order was a whopping $1 less). Second fail - I get home and the morons have given me the wrong salad. A southwest chicken ranch. I will never go to this location again."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery, I have to admit... I have had some long held resentment against you, ever since the Panera debacle.  I'm still a little bitter that you blocked their entrance into the Phoenix market... but I digress.   Once my anger over the Panera situation started to fade, I decided that the crack-like addicting cookies at PB were still calling my name, so I returned begrudgingly.  Of course, like any good addict, one visit led to another... and led to another.  Now, I've got my kid hooked, too.  Yep - I'm mom of the year.

Seriously though, this location has great service and Paradise Bakery has some darn tasty food (despite being a chain - *gasp*).  I particularly like the chicken salad sandwich, fire-roasted tomato soup, and southwest caesar salad with added corn/pepper mixture.  Do NOT skip the cookies.  In fact, you should probably get a few for later... snickerdoodles are my personal fave, but you can't go wrong with any of them."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick lunch and ordered 2 bagels and a turkey sandwich (no cheese) for my son. As parents of a little one with allergies (dairy and peanuts) it's such a challenge to find things he can eat, but also where restaurants will make us feel comfortable asking for he allergen menu. Da Shia was fantastic at the counter and gave us some examples of meals our LO could have, Pam delivered the food and was very kind to our little man, she even stopped back to check on him. The turkey sandwich was on a multigrain style bread and I've found that some, not all, contain milk ingredients. The manager, Cinnamon did her best to research and when she found that she wasn't able to confirm the ingredients, she offered alternatives. Thank you Da Shia, Pam, and Cinnamon for providing us a great experience for our family!"}
{"text":"Not my best Panera experience. But I'll always love me some Broccoli Cheddar Soup... I mean if this Panera has any bread bowls. And why the dinner rolls? And needs to update and get the self order machines."}
{"text":"This location is huge! Very clean and the staff are awesome. Much like the other Panera locations, food is on point and the drinks are refreshing. The healthy part is just a bonus!

I laugh every time I go in there. 2 separate lines: people who know what they want and the people standing at the back trying to choose. Love it!"}
{"text":"Its what you expect. Its a sandwich, soup and salad, place. Its a chain so each place taste the same. Its not any better then any other Panera. They are good at what they do if you want a quick bite to eat that is a healthier option then the traditional fast food chain."}
{"text":"The food is decent but they do not check orders that are going out on delivery. Wrong food has been sent, no utensils or condiments. When I call and tell the manager they just want to give me a free item. Not looking for anything just want what I order to be correct. Please check your orders before going out the door!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch with my mom yesterday and every time panera just hits the spot!! The broccoli cheddar soup and smokehouse turkey panini hits the spot! We sat outside enjoying lunch and a beautiful day. I just have one critique to say; my sandwich was poorly made (tasted great) but the turkey looks like they just threw it on and didn't equally spread throughout the sandwich. Now I understand this may seem silly but it really bothered me, it looks like basically a little kid threw together a sandwich, it's little bit still bothered me. Other than that most enjoyable for a quick lunch! Ps the hot chocolate chip cookies are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"It's a everywhere and it's nothing unique but it's mostly fresh and they have mostly healthy options for mostly reasonable prices.

The half/half combos available for all their soups, salads, and sandwiches make this place a constant lunchtime stop for me.  The Fontana grilled cheese.  The tortellini  Alfredo pasta.  The Cesar.  All classics and all done fairly well here.

The negative: the sweeping.  Nearly every time I've been here someone has come by my table and started sweeping the carpet with a brush broom... Over and over and over.  Besides the dust that I'm sure it's putting into the air (and my food) it also makes a whole lot of noise and takes away from the meal.

Certainly not a completely unique adventure.  But fairly solid food for a quick eat place."}
{"text":"Man this place... 
Last couple times I've gone here have been nothing but crappy. First time they don't have the soup I want so okay whatever I leave. Second time they have the soup I want, but ran out of bread bowls so I left. Third time (which was today) they finally have the soup and bread bowl combination I've been dying for, and then they forget my side. Never going here again and definitely never recommending anybody to this one. Just let down after let down."}
{"text":"It's not in Hawaii yet, so it is one of the more popular chains on the US mainland that I needed to go to, just to get my fix. Panera Bread is a part coffee / breakfast place, along with it being a different experience to Starbucks and other similar eateries. Maybe they do copy Starbucks on some aspects, but clearly Panera Bread is something pretty awesome. Too bad they're not in Hawaii just yet, but I wish they would be so that they can compete with Starbucks

Part bakery as well, Panera Bread prides itself on good customer service and lots of its delicious products freshly made and handcrafted to its clientele each day. This particular Panera Bread location I have visited is part of the Hatchery Hill shopping complex, located in Fitchburg WI. I really liked their restaurant layout, which is part restaurant and part cafe, with some power outlets to recharge portable handheld devices while on the go.

Not a lot of things else to say about Panera Bread other than they have good food products. While I do not drink coffee anymore, I ordered their hot chocolate, oatmeal, and their breakfast smash sandwich recently and it was col
cool. The prices can be pricey, but it can be your alternative to daily grind of fast food. I'm sure Panera Bread draws all sorts of clientele, so they can give Starbucks a run for their money - at least. Prices here are kinda jacked up there for the meals and sandwiches they serve. While Panera Bread I imagine is a national chain, it does have its benefits. 

There is plenty of parking here within the shopping center, with some parts of these spaces are dedicated to just Panera Bread. That's pretty awesome anyway. Many people - just like Starbucks - come here to chat, hang out, read, do whatever while enjoying Panera Bread's food and beverages. Like Starbucks, they won't kick you out for anything, as long as you aren't loud or doing anything obnoxious that will get your ass kicked out of the store. It can get busy during the morning and other peak times, so plan accordingly.

Support local!

{"text":"Well where do I start... I really dislike this place, and it seems every visit is worse and worse. My first experience with them, I had old lettuce in my salad. Second visit, the salad was alright (green goddess Cobb), but the steak and cheddar sandwich was just god awful. Couldn't taste anything but the horseradish sauce they put on there. Third and final visit, got the green goddess again, and the Italian sandwich, because hey, who can mess up an Italian? Apparently they can. There was no dressing on the sandwich and the bread was so hard it literally cut open my mouth. Even the side rolls they give you were so hard, my dogs couldn't even chew it. If you're craving a salad and sandwich, I would recommend driving a few extra miles and go to cafe zupas."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service, and excellent location!  I love this place!  My husband and I go every time we can! Soup, salad, sandwiches, you can't beat them!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  
Asked for a smoothly yo exclude an ingredient the cashier said ok after I explained what I wanted I paid for it then the person making the smoothie stated that it is against company policy to make a smoothie different. 
Bathroom was so dirty I could not use it. And the eating area almost every table was dirty."}
{"text":"Despite the fact this is chain restaurant, they seem to have poor management of stock.  Several Sunday's ago I came at 10:00 only to find they were completely out of bagels. Of course and bakery should have that kind of stock on one of the busiest days of the week. Poor management. 

Recently l, was In the location were manager was chastising an employee in plain view of the customers. He didn't succeed in correcting the mistake, he only made the organization look bad. His tone was very condescending.  L

I ordered a toasted bagel which when it arrived was not toasted.  I asked for it to be toasted and when the MOD came back, he said he didn't like my attitude. 

Again this is a reflection of site management and their inability to manage, correct errors, stock appropriately or deal with the public."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT THE PASTRIES! We saw the manager do a nightly count of all the pastries and touched everyone with his fingers (no gloves). I commented and said excuse me you are touching all of the pastries with no gloves??! He looked at me and said, \"I'm not touching them I'm only tapping them\". Yuk, i said that's disgusting people have to eat that. He looked at me and went in the back. I told the cashier Thomasina that i would be calling the owner.. that's unexceptable. She reluctantly gave me the owners name. Luke I'll be calling U tmrw!"}
{"text":"Got my food on a dirty tray and the soup spoon was dirty too. The ladies behind the counter were talking about how they hate their jobs there too. Very unprofessional and will never visit this location again."}
{"text":"This is the first time I visit a Panera Bread near me and I decided to come in during their rush hour. I know that's the worst time to come in and then do a review on this place. But let's be honest the true colors come out when you can handle a rush hour exceptionally. Panera Bread has great food, I won't jeopardize my integrity as the rest. The only inconvenience for me was the weak customer service and the miscommunication. I just do not understand how you cannot tell your customer where to pick up their food, so you try to figure that out on our own, and when you hand them their order after a 30 minute wait time and the french baguette is the driest most hardest piece of bread to chew in the entire planet. Most disappointing the fact that they threw the french baguette in the bag, not even in a separate container but savagely in the bag, rolling around until I opened the bad at work and saw the french baguette lonely all the way in the bottom. I was unsatisfied with my experience I want to be positive for my next visit and hopefully they can pack my order and listen to me when I want to give honest feedback, the policy states that if you are unhappy with something or have any inconvenience Panera Bread will give you a treat as compensation. I just want more responsibility and maybe that can impact the representation and ambiance of the place. I know Panera Bread can do way better! I believe in Panera."}
{"text":"I come here 2-3 times a week because I enjoy the vibe, food, smell and the whole experience. But the crew that was working this morning 11/30/15 were just disappointing. I usually deal with a sweet girl but this morning with 3 young ladies behind the counter avoiding the look at me as I'm the only one in line just got me heated. Not until I asked if someone could help me is when the one girl helped me. Her name is Dayna, I think, she as well tried to ignore me, I think she was new, I know she tried her best to smile and give me good service, but what looked to be a manager in plain clothes behind the counter, didn't say or do anything to the ladies talking stories and giggling. 

POOR SERVICE!!!

I'm hoping it was just this particular day because any other day the girl there in the morning is very nice."}
{"text":"Where do I even start. 
First, I was greeted by the evening teenaged crew calling each other derogatory terms and calling each other broke. I really felt like I was in a high school class room it was ridiculous. THEN we received our food to go, made it home to realize there was CHICKEN in our VEGAN SOUP!!! We ordered the Vegan Lentil quinoa bowl and got chicken instead. Went all the way back to wait for 10 minutes for the manager while watching a worker eat a strawberry while cleaning up tables, taking a bite in between picking up plates... once the manager decided to show herself, she then did NOTHING. Said \"oh sorry\" and refunded the order. Nothing else no actual concern and she probably didn't even tell her staff about the issue. Really disappointed, all I ask is that if you are gonna serve VEGAN options, educate your staff."}
{"text":"So far, I've only had positive experiences at this Panera. Their Fuji Apple Chicken Salad is better than most other Panera locations... their baked goods, however, leave something to be desired. Why would you put chocolate sprinkles on a chocolate croissant? It's not a doughnut!

Anyhow, I do like how low-key this location is... the one by Waterfront is way too crowded and hectic."}
{"text":"I had the worst worst boxed lunch from Panera today. It was such a disappointment because usually they do a good job with our catering orders. 

My office ordered from the catering menu so you get what they call a boxed lunch.  On the catering menu, they describe the boxed lunch salad as your choice of Premium, Signature or Cafe salad served with 1/2 of a baguette (plain or whole wheat) and your choice of cookie. 

I ordered the Thai Chopped Chicken salad - which I have had before and the first time I loved it.  Sadly, this time it was just gross. 

When I opened the salad, I noticed immediately that they had forgotten the low-fat Thai Chili Vinaigrette which is usually included in little containers on the side.  Oh well, no worries, I'll live without salad dressing even though last time I thought the chili vinegrette was pretty tasty.  

But then I bite into the salad and there is something gritty.  I take another bite of just  chicken and again, there's the grit.  It was also in the roasted veggies.  Did they sandblast the chicken & veggies before grilling them?  Yucko, big thumbs down.   :-( 

I really don't know why they advertise that the salad boxed lunch comes with a portion of baguette, but they don't serve that - instead they throw a bag of potato chips in which is a weird accompaniment for a salad.  

And my final disappointment of this meal, despite the fact that I requested a toffee nut cookie, they have given me an oatmeal raisin instead.   Oatmeal rasin is ok, but if I am going to splurge and indulge in a sweet treat, I'd really rather it be the flavor I ordered. 

What's up Panera at Ballantyne?  Hope next time you do a better job."}
{"text":"Worst coffee I've ever tasted! Bring back paradise bakery! I'm absolutely so distraught that Paradise bakery is gone panera bread is nothing like their yummy cookies salads ice coffee!!!"}
{"text":"I should have believed the 2 1/2 star rating on this place but I was hungry and had a giftcard for Panera. I've never really liked the food at Panera but this visit was an all time low. First of all, the cashiers are slow AF. There was 1 person in front of me and yet I had to wait so long just to place my order. Ya, I know they have these machines where you can avoid the cashier but they were in use. Secondly, the \"system\" was down in the kitchen so none of our orders were showing up on their screens. It was a hot mess. And thirdly, when I opened my to go order at home (1/2 turkey,cheddar and apple sandwich and cup of broccoli cheese soup), the sandwich was not what is advertised. Instead of simple ingredients like in the title, it had sloppy coleslaw on top, that was obviously put on with a heavy hand. Made the sandwich SO soggy. But even with just apples and no dressing, this sandwich was below average. Boring! Finally, you don't get a free cookie with your meal. Like you used to at Paradise Bakery. And the cookies are not nearly as good as Paradise bakery cookies! I won't be coming back here!"}
{"text":"This is one of two Paneras that are close to us.  We tend to use this one most because it is the closest and most direct to get to.   Unfortunately they can't handle a to go order for the life of them.  We have had so many missing items that it is not funny.  We have resorted to asking them to check again when we are there and even that doesn't work.  Always a sandwich or soup missing because they don't know how to do their jobs property. If your job is to check all the food before it goes out, yet there is always something wrong, you should be fired.   So manager Gave, packer Luis and checker Rojillio, you need to go find another job that doesn't require paying attention.  We are putting in a formal complaint with corporate that includes your names specifically since you are all part of our last and final issue with your store."}
{"text":"I reviewed this place when it was Paradise Bakery and it was a bad experience.  Now that it switch to Panera, I wanted to update.   The issues I had previously have been corrected by the better order flow.  The staff is the same which is nice because I felt they got frustrated at the way you had to order previously.  The food is Panera so if you like Panera, you will like this.  If you haven't been there yet I would suggest a pick 2 and get a soup and sandwich.   For soup I recommend the broccoli cheddar, baked potato or French onion.  The first two are thick so using the buagetts as a spoon works great.  For sandwiches I suggest the steak and white cheddar panini or the turkey apple cheddar sandwich. 

Now that the change to Panera has been made they moved from a frustrated 2 stars to 4."}
{"text":"The food is panera but the service is not.   We have gone to this one twice and both times they screwed up.   The first time they charged for bowls but gave us cups.   Today they forgot the bread bowl and the chips.   They would babe forgotten our pastry if I had not reminded them.   The person taking the order was not paying attention much and the bag checker obviously isn't doing their job.   I will never go back to this one and recommend nobody waste their time there."}
{"text":"Last time I ever come here, I was so excited when they opened up but nine out of 10 times you come they're out of one thing or another.  Today is dinner rolls last time dinner rolls two times before that dinner rolls.  Reason to go to Panera bread is for the bread when you're out of bread what sense does that even make to come."}
{"text":"So as much as the SERVICE AND FOOD ARE GREAT! The quantity of food/portion size to price is HORRIBLE.  And that goes for any Panera. This is the main and only reason why we don't eat at Panera. Because of the price. We were given a gift card as a present so that's why we are here. The almost $9 Chicken tortellini Alfredo was delicious but it was only enough to tease me, oh with an apple. It would be best to either drop the price to 6 or add a drink to at least of set the overpriced small bowl of pasta with a few pieces(3) of bite size chicken. Smh"}
{"text":"Very good quality... Just wish they opened earlier. I really like their lentil and spinach soup."}
{"text":"I placed an order online for pickup. First they could not find the order when I got to the location. The manager did offer a cup of coffee while I wait for them to make the order which was a nice gesture and the coffee was hot and good, and actually as it turns out the best thing I had. So, I had ordered the lentil quinoa bowl with chicken cost $9.29. There was absolutely no chicken, not one piece just a small bowl of broth which was cold and a few pieces of spinach and a small amount of lentils and it just did not even taste good. I had also ordered the chicken walnut sandwich it allowed me to customize the sandwich online with different toppings none of which I could locate on this sandwich, the walnuts were the best part of the sandwich cost $7.69. They have a Tuesday bakers dozen bagel for $6.99 so decided to order those, well the bagels as I opened the bag are all so hard they look like they have been sitting for a while, did not look fresh at all. The website lay out I was impressed with. The food did not match all that. The prices are ridiculously high for what you get. I was really disappointed overall. I will not return."}
{"text":"Would rate a 3 or 4 if rating food only. Order accuracy is terrible at this location. They left chicken off salads ordered several times. 
Another disappointment is their pecan sticky buns.
They leave the sticky coating off the side. Rolls are smaller and not as fresh as other locations."}
{"text":"I didn't specifically order Panera.  It was a catering order brought in by a sales team to talk to my office.   Knowing in advance that I have a severe tomato allergy, the sales team specifically requested that the entire order be tomato free due to my allergy.   

The salad had no tomatoes. Yay!  None of the sandwiches had tomatoes.  Yay!! 

I grabbed a sandwich marked \"Turkey\".  I took out the turkey from the sandwich to put on my salad.   At some point, I decided to try a morsel of the bread and instantaneously had a reaction.  The sales team called the store to ask them about what might be on the bread to then find out the bread was tomato basil.   Does this make sense?  You left off the tomatoes, but you put it on tomato basil bread.  *insert blank stare here*

The sandwich I apparently grabbed was really a \"Turkey Bravo\" but it was only marked \"Turkey\" , but regardless the entire order was supposed to be tomato free.   Tomato basil bread is NOT tomato free.  

Luckily, I work in a medical office and the team of Dr's and nurses jumped into action and treated me before I developed anaphylaxis,  thank God for healthcare providers!!

Did a manager call me to ask if I was ok?  No.  Yes, someone made a mistake- I make mistakes, too- but show some compassion and accountability.  A follow up phone call would have been huge, but instead, I emailed my concerns to the corporate office and they are taking this VERY seriously.  Thankfully, I am fine, but food allergies are not a joke. 

Pay attention, Panera!"}
{"text":"They advertise \" clean food\" which to me means healthy ingredients prepared in a healthy way and it seems to be true here.  The soup and salad were very good.  I rated this restaurant down, however, because the tables outside were filthy.  Dishes had not been picked up on 5 tables and none of the available tables had been wiped down.  When we complained they told me it had been a very busy day....but it wasn't busy then around 6 pm.  Someone finally picked up all the dishes but never cleaned the tables.  What I observed was young employees mostly talking to one another rather than working.  When we got our food, he apologized that our soup was in a to-go card-board container rather than a ceramic bowl, because they were \"out of\" real bowls.  I think that really meant no one had washed them.  We speculated that this company may be reducing the number of employees now that everyone is making $10/hour & the employees don't care about tips anymore, so they do as little as possible."}
{"text":"Average run of the mill Panera. Seems smaller then most...only four highly coveted booths. The spicy Thai chicken salad was good and the broccoli cheddar soup could have been a tad warmer. My wife agreed and said her French onion could have been warmer. The baby loved his blueberry bagel and my baguette dipped in the broccoli cheddar. In fact he liked the soup on its own but he eats most anything. Service was pretty slow this time but it was a busy Saturday evening. Anyway we love Panera and this location is pretty good."}
{"text":"Pretty good they catered to our swim team did a pretty good job didn't mess up any of the orders. The food tastes the same as the others so nothing special there"}
{"text":"Your typical panera bread. The place seems a bit smaller than others I've been to, like it's a little crowded with tables and chairs, but it's clean and the staff is friendly. The menu is pretty standard. Panera in general is a little on the pricier side for what you're getting, especially at this location when Artisano is just across the street with prices that are more reasonable. The salads are always fresh and the sandwiches are well made (nothing feels overly greasy and heavy). I don't mind stopping by here again, but the place fills up quickly during the weekday lunch rush, so keep that in mind. Maybe you can find a spot on their lovely patio!"}
{"text":"I understand this place has only been opened for 4 or 5 months, but every time my husband and I come here, they are either out of something or something is missing from our order, only to be realized once we are home. Panera isn't necessarily cheap and when the protein is missing from a salad, you're paying $10 for some greens. The manager seems sweet, but the kitchen staff has no idea what they are doing, this is evident when you wait for your order and get to observe the kitchen's goings-on. Such a shame, we won't be going back until they can get it together."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Paradise Bakery.  We dont have this chain in Flagstaff.  The turkey, cranberry sandwich looked good, so I ordered that, thinking it would come on a panini bun.  Turns out they the three different types of bread and the woman who took my order didn't take the time to tell me this.  So I ended up with just regular bread.  Bummed, but not a deal breaker.  The turkey tasted kinda funny and the portion was less than generous. The cranberry was the gel kind you get out of the can.  So incredibly gross.  Cookie was under baked too.  Not coming back.  First bad review I've ever given and  feel pretty bad about it.  So sorry."}
{"text":"Standard Panera fair.

The difference maker (4 isntead of 3 stars) is that the staff at this one is nice."}
{"text":"Pretty average in comparison to other locations I've visited. You walk in, you are greeted by the pastry box (wish I can have one of each!) then you view the sandwich, salad, soup and pasta menu ahead. 
I do wish the people working the registers were a bit more personable; no smile, no real welcome greeting. It's nice they offer the \"half sandwich, half salad or soup\" deal. 

I opted for the half sandwich and half salad plus an apple on the side. My sandwich was bomb, one of my all time favorites at Panera: Chipotle Chicken Avocado Press! This sammie is seriously bursting with flavor and then add some Tabasco, bam! It's pure perfection! My salad on the other hand, chicken lime, something something- was not that good. I thought it only had romaine lettuce but it had some kind of sour leafy green that really killed the dressing and over all taste. This mystery leafy green was super biter, not my cup of tea! 

Other than that, this Panera is clean, is full stocked with sauces and napkins and it's conveniently located of a super busy street."}
{"text":"I. FREAKIN. LOVE. PANERA.

I loved Panera since they first started springing up in my old hometown in New York and was psyched that I would have one so close to our new place here in Charlotte.  Funny enough, it took us almost five months to finally stop in.  This location follows suite with all the others, but the service was incredibly friendly!

I always go for the take two option and went for the summer corn chowder and a half turkey sandwich.  What a great deal for less than $9!  The food always tastes fresh and healthy.  My husband, who's never really ate at Panera much, agreed that it was worth coming back for lunch.

My only sadness was that I didn't realize that you could add on a dessert for .99 to any meal until we were on our way out.  I wish that were more prominently displayed, otherwise I definitely would have taken advantage of it!"}
{"text":"Definitely going down hill! Very poor service.
Staff speaking Spanish and laughing. Thought I was in Mexico.
They advertise that the food is clean but the Men's Room smells like a urinal.
This used to be a decent restaurant. 
I'm happy that Kneaders opened nearby. Very clean and very professional."}
{"text":"I resent being asked if I want to leave a tip. I have left a tip in the past around the Holidays without your reminder. If someone deserves a tip, by definition, it's for service above the norm."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service.  Order was made wrong and then when I asked for it to be redone they removed the wrong items and brought same sandwich back.  Took it up to the counter and asked if they gave me the same sandwich.  They proceeded to lie even though I could still see the previous ingredients on it.  When I asked them a second time they tried to get out of it at which point I just cut my losses and asked for my money back.  Neither worker seemed to care that their mistake could have made me sick.  I wouldn't patronize an establishment where the workers have no integrity to keep them from lying about the food they serve you."}
{"text":"Brocoli Cheddar soup , cherry danish & pecan roll my 3 loves at this chain restaurant . The ambiance is cozy and the service is top notch"}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times now and the service seems really slow.  The food was almost cold when I finally got it. I would expect faster service and a whole lot better food for what the price is here. Not impressed at all with a third strike, they're out!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this panera bread weekly for lunch bit the food has gone downhill.  I decided to give it another try recently but know i remember why i stopped going in the first place. I got an order to go and once again it wad terrible.  The steak panini i got was so burnt it was unedible. What a waste of money. I tried contacted corporate and guess what no reply. This will be my final time being ripped of by this place."}
{"text":"The other week I stopped in here for coffee & a cookie.  For 2 PM on a Friday, this place was hopping!  Getting in & out of the parking lot was an issue, since this location shares space with a strip mall. 

The employees are really nice & quick with your order. I got a caramel latte, which tastes just as good as Starbuck's caramel machiatto. I also got the \"m&m\" type cookie. It was huge!  I don't feel bad about paying $2+ for a cookie & $3+ for a coffee when the portion/size are big. 

Their menu is pretty extensive...coffees, pastries, baked goods, salads, & sandwiches. You quite possibly could have a different meal, all at different times of the day.

There's plenty of seating & employees are good about cleaning off tables when customers leave."}
{"text":"Headed up to the Northlake area on a Sunday morning, we wanted something delicious & quick for breakfast. We wanted a bagel & coffee, so we decided on Panera.

I changed my mind as soon as we got there however, & wanted a hot breakfast sandwich. Bacon, egg, & cheese sandwich it is! I also decided on a Caramel Latte (think Caramel Macchiato from Starbucks).  My boyfriend got the steak, egg white, & cheese sandwich & a smoothie.

I'm very please with the size of this location. It's a bit bigger than the ones I normally go to. As others mentioned, there's a good bit of parking options, but  when the other stores are open, you might have an issue. The restaurant itself is clean & the employees are friendly.

It did take quite a bit of time (for some reason) to get our meal, but when we did, everything was hot & fresh.

Other notes: Free wi-fi & calorie counter on the menu."}
{"text":"I always have good experiences whenever I come here. I get fast, good customer service. The place is clean and inviting. I love the self service options and the new delivery option. I definitely recommend going here and trying it. The prices aren't bad for having good, wholesome food. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I grabbed a Thai Chicken Salad to go for lunch and it was pretty tasty. It has grilled chicken, romaine, crushed thai cashews, fire-roasted edamame, red peppers, carrots, fresh cilantro & wonton strips and is lightly drizzled with peanut sauce.  They serve it with a side of low-fat Thai Chili Vinaigrette which had a bit of a twang.  

Unfortunately, I couldn't resist getting a delicious cookie - toffee crunch...yum-yum!  (I had to save half for later since it is a ginormous cookie!)

Assuming that the nutritional info on their website is correct, this is a better option than most \"fast-food\" salads. However, I must admit that I was afraid to look at the nutritional info on the giganta-cookie!

EDIT: ok, it was killing me, so I had to go back & check the nutrional value of the cookie - 444 calories & 23 grams of fat!!!!! Holy Scheisse! 

By comparison - the entire salad including the wontons & dressing & peanut drizzle was 390 calories and 15 grams of fat. Not bad for the salad, but next time, I'll definitely have to skip the cookie!"}
{"text":"It is nice to have a Panera Bread inside the hospital when you are hungry and don't want to do the cafeteria  option. This Panera has the standard menu items and I am a big fan of their salads. The 2 times I have visited, everything has been fine.

There is plenty of seating...however during really busy hours things might get a little crazy."}
{"text":"This location is extremely messy. The floor, the kitchen, everything is messy. The food was decent, mostly fresh (wilted lettuce) but the bread us absolutely delicious. I recommend going to a different location but over all it was good, will return to a different Panera."}
{"text":"It was March of last year and my girlfriend at the time had tickets to the Tegan and Sara show in Cleveland. I agreed to go, which was a mistake all in its own.  I wanted to grab some dinner before we left so she wouldn't have to listen to be bitch about how hungry I was, and how I had the capability to eat an entire orphanage. 

I pulled into the Panera in Kent, Ohio before getting on the freeway and ordered a chicken panini.   I got in the car and opened the bag.  Upon removing the sandwich I quickly realized, \"Oh my God, this shit smells exactly like a turkey dog\".  You wouldn't think that a turkey dog and a hot dog have separate  smells, but they do, I swear. I took a bite and not only did it smell like a turkey dog, it tasted like one. Something was obviously not right, but given the simple fact that I'm woefully ignorant, I used the logic that since I like turkey dogs, I'll continue to finish the entire goddamn sandwich. 

 We get to the concert (which was held in a fucking high school auditorium, mind you) and find our seats.  I get through the opening bands and the first fifteen minutes of Tegan and Sara boasting about the fact they're from Canada and are better than everyone else in the entire world before I realize, \"Holy loose bowels, I'M GOING TO SHIT MY PANTS\". This is not a situation any one wants to be in during a crowded concert.  It was a life or death situation.  

Running to the bathroom and clenching your asshole shut at the same time is by no means an easy task. I make it to the bathroom and sit on the toilet.  There was a moment of silence, it was like the calm before the storm.  Suddenly, liquid fire begins rocketing out of my ass at 10,000 miles per hour, breaking the sound barrier and potentially ruining all of my internal organs.  I was certain these were my final hours. I was expecting to look in the toilet and see all of my intestines.  

For some reason they had couches inside the bathroom, so I laid down crippled in fear that this was going to last forever, and began to sob. I never knew food poisoning felt this bad.  I was dizzy and completely out of sorts. I'm pretty sure I texted her from the bathroom and told her to please come and put me out of my misery.  

I have to basically be carried to my car.  I must have looked pathetic, people probably thought I was an incompetent drunk. My girlfriend has to drive us home because I was in no condition to operate a motor vehicle. As I'm curled in the fetal position in the passenger's seat, weeping like a four year old, It quickly comes to my attention that violent diarrhea was not the end of this. I was going to vomit.

Vomit is an understatement.  I grab a plastic grocery back and wrap the handles around each ear thinking it would be the absolute best way to capture all of the puke.  I begin to barf, violently.  It was like a scene straight from the exorcist.  I didn't even know that I had that much liquid left in my body, especially after the incident in the bathroom.  I filled the entire grocery bag and Girlfriend pulled over so I didn't get puke all over the car.  Even after we pulled over, I was still throwing up.  My puke had a pink hue, which lead me to believe I was hallucinating.  It must have been 2 gallons.  Literally. 

The puking and shitting finally stopped, and we went back to our friends apartment to sleep. The last thing I remember is dramatically throwing myself onto the bed like I had just survived the holocaust and then I passed the fuck out due to the fact that shooting lava out of my ass and mouth had taken a severe toll on my poor body. 
This was probably the single most traumatic experience of my entire life, and looking at a panini gave me instant flashbacks.  The kind of flashbacks your grandfather may have of Vietnam.  That bad.  Looking at a panini would render me immobile and cause panic attacks and diarrhea. 

Its been about a year since this incident, and I'm just now getting over it.  I still can't eat a fucking panini, though.  Fuck you Panera, fuck you for giving me the worst day of my life."}
{"text":"Love their food! Signed up for the rewards program and have been much happier with the discounts! Their cookies are so yummy! Always fast service and a very helpful staff!"}
{"text":"I go to Panera Bread often because I know what they serve and that it will be consistent. Usually they have very nice staff. Not this Panera. I was the only person in line and the staff was lackadaisical at best. When my coffee came up, they said they called my name I sure didn't hear them, but they never repeated it. They were not busy with customers. The apathy put me off. The egg sandwich was runny all down my shirt. When an egg sandwich is ordered one expects it to be done so it doesn't run all over your clothes. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"I come here once to twice a week for lunch.  Sometimes I order and take back to my office and other times I eat-in the restaurant.  I wish they had the option to order online, pay online and just come and pick it up!  Order Panera locations have that option but not that one. Darn!

I have only had one problem since coming here so much in the past 6 weeks.  I ordered a \"you pick 2\" to-go.  They called my name and I took my order back to my office.  Well, there must have two Lindsey's because I ordered the Tomato, Mozz & Basil Panini and Creamy Chicken & Rice Soup but received a Chicken Caesar Salad and a Bacon Turkey Bravo.  Unfortunately, I don't like either of those and confirmed it again after I took a bite of each of them.  Thank god the other Lindsey ordered the baguette for her side, so at least I had some bread for lunch. :)

I guess it serves me right ordering 2 things I have never ordered before.  But lesson learned- always check the bag before leaving the restaurant.

Other than that- the cashiers are very nice and  the to-go orders come out at a decent pace. 

P.s. Their Toffee Nut cookie is crazy good and so is the White Chocolate Macadamia cookie.  Yum!  Oh and the Mac & Cheese is yummy too! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent location, newer facilities, clean, and well kept.

But the last two times we've gone the folks in the food preparation area were either rude or in the middle of conversations totally not-ok for the workplace.  So you either get the food incorrectly prepared or you get made feel uncomfortable as heck.

C'est La Vie."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for good soups, salads and bagels, and really good baked breads and muffins.   

The corporate food business model is based on the idea that people will keeping coming back for mediocre food as long as the food is predictably and consistently mediocre.  You have to hand it to them.  It's true.  People will choose mediocre food over and over again (MsDonald's, Subway, etc.) rather than try out an unknown restaurant where the food might dip below mediocre and down to awful.

But unlike the typical corporate taste model, the folks behind Panera wondered what would happen if the food offered tasted good or if the menu included numerous healthy and tasty options.  People might still come back again and again.  Good call, Panera CEOs.  You were right.

Panera offers a wide choice of sandwiches, baked goods, soups and salads.  There's something on the menu for most taste buds.  It's basically a deli / bakery with consistently decent/good food.  Here's my breakdown:

Breads--really good, borderline great (4 stars)
Muffins and muffin tops - - mostly \"hells yes\" (4 stars)
Bagels -- pretty solid (3-4 stars) 
Sandwiches -- a little hit or miss (2-3 stars) depending on your preference (but the bread will be good)
Salads -- pretty solid again (3-4 stars)
Soups -- decent (2-3 stars) -- but put it in a bread bowl and it jumps up to 4 stars b/c if I haven't mentioned it already, the bread is really good

Price is a little steeper than most corporate spots, but a lot of the food is fresh.  The service is hit or miss (it is a high volume corporate counter service place) and the ambiance is well, blah (bland and dull and nowhere I want to hang out).  But it's a solid place to get carry out from again and again."}
{"text":"You know.  For what they do... this location is one of the best.  Okay okay... its hard to mess up food as simple as Paneras, but I've seen it happen many times, but never here.  Their service is quick and they always have food i order on their app correct and ready to go on time.  For a quick lunch, near the office... it's mot unique, but it is consistent."}
{"text":"My delivery today was an extreme disappointment. As soon as I opened the door and greeted my delivery driver, she immediately said, \"You forgot to tip,\" in a very rude manner. My plan was to give her a cash tip instead of tipping on my card as usual. I go back into my house giving her a tip, and she proceeds to snatch it out of my hand. I'm very disappointed and completely turned off by her attitude, for I don't HAVE to tip her. I work in the restaurant industry myself, and I don't appreciate non-tippers; but this woman basically demanded her tip as if she was entitled. You don't demand tips, and this is how you have employees? Never getting delivery again."}
{"text":"This particular Panera is a staple in my life - which I honestly don't care to make a major corporate, chain-run restaurant my place to run to on rainy days, when I have a cold, or when I just need a bowl of soup or a healthy salad to start my day.  But it is.  It's been not only that but a place of longing that various co-workers have agreed that when we hear some Chet Baker or otherwise lounge-jazz music that we'd \"rather be at Panera.\"  It's reliable, the food is always good, and I always know what to expect.

That said - for those who aren't in the know of Panera, get out from under your rock and get in the 'know!  Panera is a light lunch/breakfast eatery that offers a bakery with morning bites, with jazz music floating throughout.  It's a hit with all ages, offering free wi-fi, and its very popular with everyone from children to seniors.  They have a you pick two deal which allows you to mix and match a variety of things from the whole soup/salad/sandwich/etc so you can get a pretty sweet combo for just six-ish bucks.  You typically have kids working there who remember your name, your preferences (One girl would give me a free cookie if I always wore one piece of Nintendo gear so I ended up with a lot of free cookies!)

My only complaint with this particular location is that the upholstery, carpetry, and the door handle and a few things here and there needs an upgrade.  They're worn and their age is showing as opposed to a few years ago when they looked brand spanking new.  A major warning that I have as far as just \"dropping into\" this place is to make SURE that you are not coming on a soccer afternoon!  See that field across of Rainbow?  Chances are that a lot of the players are going to flood Panera as soon as their game lets out and not only is going to grind service to a halt, but you may be finding that a good chunk of the menu is now depleted.  The upside to this is that there are other very good restaurants in this place about twenty feet away: Viet Bistro, Market Grille Cafe, and Chipotle.  

My particular favorite dishes?  I adore the Chicken/Rice soup, Chicken Almond Salad Sandwich, and the Thai Chopped Chicken salad are among my favorites.  Keep in mind that the soups change from day to day and that certain non-creme based soups do not do well in their delicious sourdough bread bowls."}
{"text":"Panera is way overpriced for the quantity of food you get. People eat there because they think it's healthy, but it's only healthy because you eat less because you can't afford to eat a full size portion."}
{"text":"I am only rating the experience on this location as it has a lot of work to do. Service is terribly slow and orders are not always accurate. Whether your ordering from the kiosk or from the clerk, the orders somehow managed to get mangled. The worst part about this location is the food is never hot. Mac and cheese, soup...both have been a huge disappointment. I won't be visiting this location ever again"}
{"text":"Edit 11/11/15: no bacon on my bacon turkey bravo. Called them and they offered to make me a new sandwich if I bring this one back in. Because I want to spend 20 minutes of my day extra just so that I can get what I ordered. Lowered to 1 star for now. My recommendation: don't leave the restaurant without checking your food carefully.

I like Panera as a chain, but this store can be a bit of a hot mess at times. I was once told by an employee that I could not add a pastry to my meal for 99 cents unless I did the pick 2 meal; only after the transaction was finished did the employee realize her mistake, and when I asked if I could add it on at that point, I was told that I could not because it had already gone through. There have been a couple of times that I've had ingredients on my sandwich that are not specified on the menu and that I did not ask for (such as tomato on the smokehouse turkey panini).

Overall, it's not the best Panera location by far, but it's not that bad."}
{"text":"This is not okay. I ordered a tomato soup with a side of gruyere cheese. After half way in I devoted to add my cheese in but to my surprise there was a bug in the cheese. I spoke with the manager he was very kind and refunded the money.  Although I will  never get panera again."}
{"text":"Very good food and friendly staff. Could be a bit cleaner."}
{"text":"I wanted a hot bowl of soup and was already down at the Waterfront. Panera is really the only place to get a big bowl of soup down here, and I had my work with me so I thought I'd kill two birds with one stone. The cashier, Shailyn, was super nice, but she was the only perk of this Panera location. My soup was cold, and there is not a single table in the entire restaurant that has an outlet. Horrible. Won't come back to this location."}
{"text":"Man this best place ever. This second time trying this and it amazing. A young man with orange hate around 5:26 took my order and I put my order in his hands. Everything he picked was amazing. They have best green tea ever, just know I'll be back. You whole night shift did an amazing job I felt really well taken care of. And to the male cashier thank you and always FREASH BREAD!! :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Panara Bread location for some time. The food is ALWAYS fresh!! Today I had the Lemon Chicken Orso soup and a Greek salad :)) yummy!! Not to mention when you get a Panara Bread card you earn food. Today I received a free cheese Danish. Feeling Happy!"}
{"text":"Trust me. I love Panera. This location is lack luster. It can get so busy on a Saturday that the line is out the doors. staff is inefficient to move the line. and the place just looks and feels dirty. I'm really happy to see that they are opening a location In centennial and will have to wait for them to open. Food is on the pricier side. But their mac and cheese is to die for. The steak and mozzarella sandwich is super. And I love their green tea. The Boca park location had unlimited green tea so you don't have to pay for green tea refills. Parking can be a nightmare and the business complex itself is frustrating"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this particular restaurant since we moved to Las Vegas. It is consistantly clean, well staffed, and friendly. The food is it good standard and you know what you're going to get every time. I love the bacon turkey Bravo sandwich, and since not every Panera is created equal, this sandwich is great and much better than the ones I have had at other stores in this chain! One thing I would like to add in case the manager ever sees this, yes we would love for you to bring back the good green lettuce for the salad!  But I will tell you that this restaurant is very well managed."}
{"text":"So slow!!! 
I stopped by while staying in town and almost immediately regretted placing my order. The cashier was friendly but was constantly distracted by rude customers. On to the actual issue...It took 10 min for oatmeal... oatmeal! This wouldn't be an issue except that I was in a hurry. Next time I'll stick with empty calories, I mean a bagel."}
{"text":"Food was above average for panera (which is always solid :)  but 5 stars for the service.  Such a friendly and pleasant staff"}
{"text":"Not great!  Over $30 for 2.  Why is half a tuna sandwich $6.29?  Bland bland bland.  Had to get up 3 times for salt, pepper, butter, knife to remake my sandwich.

My daughter says they cd do a much better job with something so simple as making a sandwich.  The sandwiches are also stone cold and feel like they were pre-made and refrigerated!

I'd recommend to go to Java Joes if you feel like this kind of lunch and get a whole sandwich for that price!"}
{"text":"Off ohio tpke. Customer service was great. Gave me a new panera bread card w/o hesitation. Price, well you know how that go, its off the tpke lol. Food was good. Pretty fast. Dont know what else to say. Helpful. Offered a free water cup."}
{"text":"I tried a salad, cookies and breakfast sandwich. They were all good but on the expensive side and small quantity. For the taste and value I feel like their competitor Wildflower and Paradise Bakery has more options.

One extra star because today I tried their avocado BLT sandwich and it was delicious. It comes with their \"own\" potato chips, about $10. It was very tasty!"}
{"text":"Out of bagels at 6:30 a.m.  That's when they open...how does this happen?  
Store is filthy...stuff all over the floors, tables are dirty.  Bathrooms are disgusting! Employees are parked in the spaces by the entrance.  I would have guessed those were for customers."}
{"text":"I have no shame in saying how much I love Panera!  I have always preferred Panera's coffee over Starbucks & I only wish they would open smaller stores so I could have it more often.  I love their rewards card too - I usually get a free item of sorts every couple of months.  Not only is the food high quality but they also have delicious baked goods, smoothies, etc - something for everyone.  The employees are always super friendly too!"}

{"text":"Panera should be ashamed to have their name associated with this operation. Spent over 20 minutes in the drive-through line received a half cooked grilled cheese sandwich (called and grilled on one side of the bread) and I was short changed two of my dozen cookies. I called The store as I was stuck in line to ask them to have the other people move out of the way so the rest of us could leave and they did nothing. I called once again after receiving my horrible order and the manager didn't really care. After a couple minutes of me complaining she offered to stick a gift certificate in the mail to me. Guess what? She never dead and it never arrived. My bill was $17 and change and I will never go back it is a horrible operation with managers who do not care or follow up!  They should fire the management and start over."}
{"text":"We just had a great experience with the staff at this Panera. Even though we had some trouble with mobile ordering on their app (1st world problems!), all the issues and minor mix ups from mobile ordering were resolved by the staff quickly. They made it right, and even gave us a gift card and cookie for the trouble. It's the small gestures that make all the difference. These guys are top notch and are empowered to \"make it right.\" Of course the food was amazing as well and came to our table very quickly. Can't say enough great things about this location, and about Panera in general. If only we could get Panera up in Salt Lake City!!"}
{"text":"I have no shame in saying how much I love Panera!  I have always preferred Panera's coffee over Starbucks & I only wish they would open smaller stores so I could have it more often.  I love their rewards card too - I usually get a free item of sorts every couple of months.  Not only is the food high quality but they also have delicious baked goods, smoothies, etc - something for everyone.  The employees are always super friendly too!"}
{"text":"It is ok. It is a chain. I was not impressed with the spinach quiche I ordered. Although it has a flaky crust there was no substance or taste. It was just ok. Not enough spinach as well. All the goods in the shop look great, but the taste was not there. Even the banana strawberry smoothie dh ordered was just eh. Good place to grab breakfast they have an app you can order from. We ordered the old fashioned way, at the counter and service was quick. The server brought out utensils as well. Very friendly and well managed. I wanted to give 4 starts for the service, but it says \"I am a fan\" which I just can't say!"}
{"text":"I was super excited when this location opened up because it gave my coworkers and I a healthier \"fast\" food option other than (what use to be) Carl's Jr. near work. 

I don't come here often mainly because it's a little time consuming. There should not be a Drive thru at this location as it isn't prioritized. It's happened multiple times where I'm ordering a pastry with a tea and it will take at least 5-10 minutes for them to grab it. If I ordered a whole meal, maybe I could understand. 

Yesterday I ordered through the app for rapid pickup and surprisingly my sandwich was made within 5 minutes. I'll learn for next time to just go inside and skip the drive thru - even if there are no other cars in line."}
{"text":"This Panera wasnt so great. Came in for breakfast at 10... the girl behind the counter was kinda dense. I wanted a sausage egg and cheese, but I cant have pork. I see they have an egg white, turkey sausage, and spinach sandwich. I ask if they can just swap the meat so I can have a turkey sausage egg n cheese. She didnt get it. I explained about 3 times before she understood. SO FINALLY ordered then waited, and waited, and waited. 10 or 15min later no food and its a to go order.  Finally I asked how much longer, about 3 minutes later I get the food and head to the truck. I ask my kid for my sandwich, why is it wrong??? No meat at all. Ughhh... run back inside they are making me late as it is. I have to get a manager to get my money back, I cant wait. Its 1022 now. Well my kid ate, I on the other hand was 3 minutes late to an appointment, and didnt have time for lunch till about 4... so I wasnt happy at all... and I usually like Paneras as a whole, this one however seriously irritated me. I wont likely be back to this location... just done with them..."}
{"text":"I first tried Panera Bread in Vegas (my second home) and I enjoyed it very much.  So just out of curiosity I decided to swing by and see how different Panera is from America vs. Canada.  I find that customer service at this location isn't too fast and I happened to wait in line for awhile and I had only couple people ahead of me. When I finally reached cash, I ordered the broccoli cheddar soup with a turkey avacado BLT sandwhich with a side asian sesame salad. I found seating and while I waited for my food I filled up my drink,  freshly brewed Acai berry Iced tea which I love. In Vegas, they normally bring your order over to the table but here, you have to pick it up (kind of like a cafeteria). They happened to forget my salad and then apologized and brought it over in no time.  Honestly, the food quality was great and not so different from Vegas but only thing that this location lacks is customer service."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people tend to either love or hate Panera; I happen to love it - the You-Pick-2 combo is one of my favorite lunch options. And as luck (good or bad depending on how my diet's going!) would have it, this location provides a daily opportunity to get one of those combos! This location is incredibly convenient for me - both for being relatively close to where I live and for being next to an old bookstore, clothes store, and a few other businesses - and has earned all 5 stars for being a bit better than the average Panera. 

One, I've never walked in here and found a shortage in sweet treats, which is a common problem if I want an afternoon bagel in a lot of other Panera locations. Two, the sandwiches here just taste fresher than a lot of other places I've been to. Three, as others have mentioned, the staff are just nicer here - I have no idea why, but I'm not complaining! Bonus star for this Panera because it's actually made its entire interior comfortable and encourages people to relax and use its wi-fi, which is something I can't say a lot of other locations have nailed just yet."}
{"text":"Worst place I have ever had any meal. This place needs to be shutdown for such poor hygiene that they maintain.

The person preparing the food had her hair done as braids and she had half of it on the front hanging near the food that she is preparing and touching the food every now and then. There was another person who was scratching her head and hair right in the kitchen and handling food. 

At the end of this I just threw away one of the sandwiches since I didn't want to eat something flavored with those braids. 

The only good thing was all these could be seen and was not happening inside a closed kitchen."}
{"text":"Its about the same as the others.  I go there for the bread.  You need to go early in day for any kind of selection.  There meals are a little pricey and you can do better with the deserts.  Join their rewards program.  Every once and a while you get a free item."}

{"text":"I'm also surprised by the bad reviews at this location! I haven't had any issues and the food is great! 

I'm a huge fan of their pick two combos. Usually a bowl of soup and a Caesar salad and every time it's been delicious. Their cream base soups are seriously so yummy (baked potato, broccoli cheddar and wild rice and chicken). 

It's a nice little sit down restaurant suitable for lunch or dinner. Usually for my husband and I (both getting pick two combos) it costs up $25 - $30. Definitely not somewhere I would run to for lunch while working, you need to sit and enjoy it. 

The food is healthy and their nutritional information is always available. 

Staff seems very friendly and I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"Stopping for a quick lunch...why do I always forget how yum-tastic Panera is?!

The guy got the steak and white cheddar panini with kettle chips.  I'm not a steak eater by any stretch of the imagination but the bite he offered me was really good, that's saying a bunch seeing though steak is right up there with tomatoes and chicken liver on the list 'o foods I loathe. 

I got the pick 2 special and chose the 1/2 Napa almond chicken salad sandwich and broccoli cheese soup.  The chicken salad was ahhh-mazing, not at all dry and packed full of almonds and grapes. That equals a ton of yummy in my tummy.  I even commented on how the lettuce even had a taste...like the lettuce that I grew on my mini farm in Tennessee.  

The broccoli soup was delish! Good amount of bright green broccoli and a nice creamy soup that had the perfect amount of cheese so it wasn't so overwhelming. The guy was lucky enough that I let him snag a few bites and he must have loved it cause I was getting puppy dog eyes the rest of the meal. He perked up when we split the chocolate pastry. It was so light and flaky with a chocolate ganache filling that was chocolaty and velvety without being super sweet. 

Pro tip:  it's a good thing to get the side order of bread so you can soak up every last drop of your super duper yummy soup!"}

{"text":"Panera, I haven't been to you in a while.  My boss has recently discovered Panera (now that he's dieting) and he loves it because you can track your calories!  I happen to love that too.

The Independence location is close to work and always hoppin'.  Despite the business the employees are always kind and quick to get your order prepped & get you on your way."}
{"text":"Panera rocks out! I love the options they provide in ordering. They have rapid order kiosks upfront, online or face to face options. If in doubt on your order status, they have an electronic board to let you know if they are preparing your food or it is ready. 

Fresh ingredients are the foundation of this great semi-fast food restaurant. Their lettuce for their Chicken Caesar Salad was crisp. The chicken was flavorful. The salad was dressed well and finished with fresh Parmesan.

I enjoyed their baked onsite baguette with their Chicken and Wild Rice Soup. Great texture, almost a chowder. Their Tomato Bisque is always a winner among my family.

We carried out our order this time. But, we were also impressed by the great Wi-Fi and comfortable, I can hang out hear and grade my papers or conduct a small business lunch atmosphere."}
{"text":"They have a good selection of really yummy looking pastries. I tried the cheese danish, which was very tasty. The caramel latte is really delicious as well. Not too strong and the whipped cream on top was a really good touch. The only thing I didn't care for was their chicken alfredo tortellini. The pasta was alright, but the chicken on top was cold and flavourless. Not sure why they would serve cold chicken with hot pasta...seems weird to me. Maybe they just messed up. I'd stick to the pastries and beverages if I were you."}
{"text":"It's not a secret that I like Panera, so after dealing with a spring cold for a week I went ahead and stopped on in at a Panera for some much needed comfort food. This is one of the newer Panera's in the area, and one of the bigger ones, I think. Maybe it only felt that way because the place wasn't jam packed when I stopped in, but I thought the place was nice, clean, and spacious overall.

As nice as the place looked I did think the staffing set-up could be improved. They seemed really understaffed - I mean the place wasn't packed, but it wasn't totally empty, either (and about five people got in line behind me not long after I walked in, so there was a steady stream of visitors, too). Before I could even order I waited five minutes as the only poor girl at the register took an order, ran back to restock something, and heated up bakery items. So another helping hand would have definitely gone a long way in getting the line moving and keeping everything stocked.

After placing my order I found a table in the sunshine, sat and waited for my beeper to go off. So I was quite surprised when someone brought food to my table - it seemed odd for Panera but it was a nice touch, although it did leave me wondering why they had people bringing around trays and not, you know, stocking the bakery so the poor girl at the registers could take orders more quickly. I further questioned the need for a server at a Panera when I dropped off my empty dishes - the trash was overflowing and none of the used plates had been taken away in quite a while.

So yeah, there's definitely room for improvement at this particular Panera. The food is fine - a Panera is a Panera, and I actually really enjoyed trying their new tomato mozzarella flatbread during my visit here - but the place would really benefit from having an extra hand or two around to help behind the registers, in the bakery and in the kitchen. I'm more than happy to pick up my own food if it means that set of hands can help keep things running behind the counters."}
{"text":"Love this place ! great service food is good and so are the baked goods I live really close to the area and this is a place I frequently visit"}
{"text":"Had a business meeting there today and a mouse was running around the main dining area. Employees tried to catch it for about 5 minutes, but gave up. Wonder where it went?"}
{"text":"Hey, a Panera is a Panera. I have fond memories of this one just because it's located near Pitt, where I attended college; I would meet a number of friends for dinner here and even interview people for the school paper here. Good times!

However, no Panera is perfect. The biggest drawback to this Panera is its location. The service is wonderful and the food is as good as it is at any other Panera, but unfortunately if it's time for the midday/dinner rush nothing will save you from getting lost in the swarm of students and staff members all looking to get a yummy sandwich or bowl of soup. It's always good to have a back-up plan in case the line is really long here - fortunately it's Oakland, so there's no shortage of alternative eateries. Also: if you want parking, try the Panera that's along Boulevard of the Allies; that one has a parking lot, but this one does not.

On the plus side, in recent years this Panera's added a LOT of new space to accommodate the population it feeds, which is wonderful; it doesn't do much to help when you're standing in line, but at least once you get your food you have a greater chance of finding a table hidden in the back corner and you can use the wi-fi in relative peace. Still, fair warning: extra space or not, be ready to compete with a massive student population if you want to sit in here.

One final note and tip: if you're looking to host a class or meeting here, go for it: this Panera, (like many, it seems) has a nice meeting room that's separate from the main dining area. The one here is almost constantly in use - that's how popular this place is. Everyone likes Panera in Oakland, I guess!"}
{"text":"So by now friends probably know I'm a total Panera addict. I spend a lot of time running around the city and on the road, and it's nice to know I can get a you-pick-two combo at Panera that isn't calorie laden and still tastes good. Of course, if I want to splurge, Panera is good for that, too!

It's kind of funny being in Oakland because there are two Panera's within a mile or so of each other - one's right on Forbes Ave., and then there's this one. So which is better?

I guess it depends on what you want. The major pros here are the parking lot and the massive number of tables in here. I couldn't turn a corner without finding another table, even during the dinner rush. Also, this may depend on who is working when, but often I'll get massive pieces of bread as my side here, which I love - extra bread is always good in my book!

Unfortunately, the parking lot fills up SUPER quickly here so that pro is a moot point sometimes. Then there's the fact that I never know what to expect behind the counter when I come here. Some days there's couple people taking orders, and a handful more preparing the food - like you see in any Panera. That said, it's not uncommon to see just one person manning the registers when the line has about 15 people waiting for food - but then instead of having extra hands help with food prep or taking orders, they have someone bring the food to the tables. I find this is ridiculous, for two reasons. One, it's Panera. You have pagers. We have no problem coming to get our food - help move that long line along by taking orders! Two, I hate this idea of someone bringing your order to you in a Panera. They don't take your order and put it in, they're just given the food on a tray and told to take it to you by other staff. How do they even know where you're sitting? At this point I've never been given a number or anything to put on my table so I honestly don't know. I always stand by the counter waiting for my food rather than risk having an issue and having to wait even longer when this set-up is in place.

Fortunately these problems are not regular issues; I've met with a friend here on weekends and we've had no complaints on those days ordering wise. And sometimes when I stop in the staff DO use the pagers to let you know that you can go to the counter and get your food. It's very strange that they don't always do this to me, though.

As for the lines, well, the weekday meal rushes are just bad in ANY Oakland eatery since, well, it's Oakland - filled with students, residents, AND Pitt staff, plus local businesses and regular residents. It happens. So, despite the weird operations system that is implemented half the time here, I think this Panera's just fine. Not great, not amazing, but if you want Panera, it's fine."}
{"text":"Well that was underwhelming. Understand, I love me some Panera. The you-pick-two combo is one of my favorite go to comfort meals - you can't go wrong with a sandwich  and French onion soup.

Where you CAN go wrong is the customer service and boy did this place disappoint on that front. One girl manning the registers during a busy time of evening? Not only that but I think she was in training, as someone occasionally came up to explain things to her. (Why not stay up there and help her, I must ask?) 

After ten minutes I finally got to order, although I'm glad the girl read it back to me seeing as I had to correct what she put down twice. Food was standard for Panera and the building itself was really lovely. But the level of service was definitely unforgivable, especially since I've seen even busier Panera's handle orders a LOT faster. Go to another location if you can!"}
{"text":"Great service, tasty cookie. We came because my daughter needed comfort food. All three in our party ordered the Pick 2 meals. My daughter ordered the creamy tomato soup. It was good as usual. She also had Chicken Alfredo Tortellini. The pasta was bland and lacked seasoning. My son got the baked potato soup in a bread bowl. It tasted of raw potato and raw onion. We brought it back. The manager kindly took it back and brought us another soup: the delicious broccoli cheese soup. I ordered the flip flop cookie. That was yummy. The dough was tangy and zippy. The frosty was sweet and sugary. I then enjoyed my Frontega chicken panini which was okay. The tomato soup was in a bread bowl. We liked our meal and enjoyed the cookie as a birthday bonus on my hubby's Panera rewards card."}
{"text":"I have loved Panera for many years. This impromtu visit was a little disappointing. My partner and I decided on Panera after a few hours of gambling across the street at Tuscany. I chose the Pick 2, a turkey apple salad sandwich on walnut cranberry bread and a bowl of chicken noodle soup.  Everything was great until the food arrived and the bottom half of the sandwich was completely soaked by the salad, though it was good, it was hard to eat as it fell apart.  The soup was just as disappointing as it was a bowl of very good chicken broth and a couple noodles; not a single piece of chicken. 

The best part of both meals was the .99 cent upsold pastries we had for dessert.

Though this visit was a let-down, it was not the norm and I will patronize this Panera store again."}
{"text":"I love this place but the woman putting the food at the counter was a horrible person. Throw the trays like a total asshole. The person after ended up with their soup all over their tray! Will never come back to this one"}
{"text":"This review is based on my last few visits to this Panera. Afterall, every place of business can have an off day. Or two. Okay, three. Four? Five? I'm feeling stupid for passing over my hard earned dollars in return for below average service and mistakes. Today I stopped in to grab their large mac and cheese --- which at nearly $10 ain't cheap. But hey, it's damn good so I fork over the cash. I usually share the order with my youngest child ---- when I got home, I opened that container and it was half full at best. HALF FULL! Check out the photo. Ironically, I stood at the pickup counter with my little beeper listening and watching as the other customers were contending with the clueless staff. (Sorry staff...it's up to your boss to train you effectively --- and HELP YOU.) Anyway, I'm standing there thinking \"I'm safe. How can they screw up mac & cheese and a container of soup?\" Well, now I know....by half filling the darn container. Jeez. I was ripped off. Thinking back to my last several visits, the problems at this Panera boil down to the people. There is just an overwhelming sense of confusion on the part of everyone that works there --- nobody seems to know what the hell is going on and me and the rest of the customers just stand there smiling with open wallets. What's wrong with us?  Of course there are a couple folks there that have it going on --- they certainly have their work cut out for them. I'll probably go back at some point --- and you'll probably find yourself there too. But be warned and check your order! (After-thought: The Chagrin Falls area crowd can be pretty demanding...they want what they want when they want it --- I'm surprised they haven't whipped this crew into shape by now.)"}
{"text":"I ordered the chopped chicken cobb with avocado salad. Got to work, opened the box, and low and behold, no chicken.

Really?"}
{"text":"It's Panera--you know what to expect.  

The service sucks at this location.  I ordered a french toast bagel.  While getting the rest of the bagels for us, they came back and said they were out of french toast.  There was a whole basket full on the bottom--they just didn't look!  I had to point it out to them.  I then picked up my latte and it was COLD.  Not cold as in it had been sitting too long, but just plain cold.  

Annoying."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. Their mac n' cheese is so good....i usually get the \"pick two\" deal and pair the mac n' cheese with a half sandwich. Plenty of food. I have to say though, some of the sandwiches are very sad. But some are outstanding. For instance, i love Frontega Chicken. But my friend ordered some type of turkey sandwich and it was so plain looking. It came on plain sliced bread, no exciting veggies or anything. Very boring. So its a hit and miss depending on what you get. I love that you have the option of either apple or chips."}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times before. The staff has always been pleasant and I'm always very happy with my food. Today I misread the closing time and came in a few minutes before close. They were still super gracious and made me a coffee even though they had already put away the rest of the coffee!"}
{"text":"I visit Panera Bread, Square One location as often as I can!  The customer service here is consistently friendly, helpful and efficient :). 
The positives of eating here are many.  They open early so you can have a tasty breakfast and remain open until 10 pm, except on holidays. 
The name Panera Bread is misleading as they offer much more than just sandwiches. As you walk in there are so many delicious pastries made daily, something to suit all tastes. There are many bread loaf and bagel options, again made fresh daily. If you are buying a loaf, you can specify either regular or thick slice. I recommend regular, as the bread is hearty and filling, much denser than grocery store bought loaves.   
Unlike fast food chains, you can order whatever you like from the menu, regardless of the time. Walk up to the counter, place and pay for your order. If you dine in, they bring your order to your table. If you order to go, pick up at the takeout counter. 
There are many options for meals, broths, soups, chili, sandwiches, pressed panini, salads. Drink options are plentiful too; brewed coffees, espresso, cappuccino, lattes, iced coffee, teas, iced teas, smoothies and my favourite lemonade. Please note the menu alters seasonally. If you can't choose one thing go for the Pick Two.  You can select two items of a smaller portion, however, it's still a lot of food.  Your choice of sides are; Apple, kettle chips or baguette for no extra charge. If you are eyeing  a pastry, you can add one for only $1.39, regular prices are around $2.49. One tip, if you want to add or subtract toppings on your sandwich just ask, pile on the veggies no charge, they only charge extra if you add cheese. You can do the same for condiments too. 
Some may be turned off by the prices, however you are getting fresh, quality ingredients, and you can taste it in every bite. I would rather eat here than at Timmy's and there's more variety than a burger joint. 
If you are counting calories, don't fear, they are listed right on the menu!
The only downside is that this is a very busy location. There's very comfortable indoor seating and outdoor patio seating in the summer. I most often take my order to go. They supply napkins and plastic cutlery. The parking lot is often full, especially at lunchtime and on the weekends. 

If you aren't satisfied for any reason just let somebody know, staff members Leny, Vince, Heidi and Lourdes are more than happy to assist you. Give them your feedback, they are very receptive."}
{"text":"An okay Asian sesame salad with chicken. Lettuce was not fresh. Friendly employees. Great location near UNC Charlotte."}
{"text":"1. Long/ slow line at the register.  Used self ck out instead.  Pretty nice.  

2. Quinoa oatmeal with side fruit salad.  Ham egg and cheese sandwich.  
Oatmeal was good with a hint of sugar and cinnamon. Wish it was a little bit warmer.  Fruit salad was ok.  Cheese pastry is always good.  My favorite.  
Ham egg and cheese.... Just ordinary sandwich. I could have made a better one but oh well.  

3. Nice customer service."}
{"text":"Panera Bread used to one of my favorite places. I used to come in here a-lot to buy bagels and other goodies that I enjoy eating. However, things has changed due to my new visit here on sunday may 6 2012. I stopped there tonight wanting a sandwich and a salad. Well guess what -they closed early due to a meeting/training( this meeting should have been held some other time without closing or they could have made it aware to customers on a website or somethings). Its ok because not only did i waste my time & gas, but I came across a new deli that will be getting my business. So thanks vey much- and yes i will miss my fiji apple chicken salad,  but o- well."}
{"text":"If you order Rapid Pickup and there's a problem with the order, expect no notice. They'll just hold it in limbo until you go up and confront them about your missing order. No one bothers to check if anyone waiting by Rapid Pickup is waiting for that order. No one bothers to check much of anything with the customers waiting. Even after you confront them, it'll take extra time for them to fix the damn order, and you're still left with cold goddamned food."}
{"text":"Im always a fan of panera. This location is always busy but its the closest to me so I keep going. It is consistent but some times I fell like the wait for food when you're staying in seems long.  It is always clean, they tend to have everything when I am there and while it may take a bit long sometimes its always made right."}
{"text":"I did not know they were open for breakfast. My son and I were looking for breakfast place. Great breakfast pastries.  Had a quiche like breakfast pastry. It was very good"}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch before shopping at Square One! Great service by the employees and the cashier who recommended I try the spicy thai chicken salad (which was delicious)! Along with the salad, I tried their turkey avocado blt sandwich, which although the turkey was a little dry, was thoroughly enjoyable. Overall, great atmosphere and service make this location a must visit."}
{"text":"Great place. Great atmosphere. Great food. Coffee leaves something to be desired however. And there is an unfortunate lack of electrical outlets. Laptoppers, beware!"}
{"text":"Dude, they need to clean.  It was like searching for a needle in a haystack to find a clean table here.  Never saw anyone clean any of the dirty tables around me the 20 min I was here. One guy was collecting trays, but honestly it's a large space and with that many people coming in and out you need 2 people dedicated to the task of keeping it clean. Food and crumbs on the tables and on the floors.  Someone needs to tell them that what happens in the front of the house could likely be an indication of what is happening in the back of the house.  If they don't care what it looks like in the public areas where everyone can see can you tell me they honestly care what it looks like in the back (where no one can see) where they're preparing food?  Praying I don't get sick from this meal and never coming back."}
{"text":"So disappointed in the Caprese Sandwich at Panera Bread at Waverly. I even asked what was on it to make sure it was what I was looking for. No tomatoes or fresh mozzarella. Soggy and cold. Spent 20 bucks on lunch and didn't eat my sandwich. There should be something between the bread. I will not use drive through again."}
{"text":"Don't go to this location. I often come here and use the drive through but my order is hardly ever correct, as it's always missing something. I only go here because of how convenient the drive through is but should really go to the one closer to home. I have written an email to Panera head quarters but have yet to receive an email back! I am a frequent customer and am very disappointed :( The service I get is very friendly though I will say that."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times, but am undecided.  It's clean, spacious, and has a great location - a good meeting place.  Other than that...I got nothing.  My last time \"in\" I ordered a coffee drink.  Not knowing how it was made or what was in it, I asked.  Apparently I caught the girl behind the counter completely off guard, and had to break it down - beginning first with the type of coffee.  Questions answered, my thought was it shouldn't take long - I was the only one in line.  Wrong!  I don't know if the lady went outside to milk a cow while I dozed off to sleep, but at least 15 minutes went by before my drink was ready.  I also asked for water.  At Starbucks I am handed a cup filled ice and water.  Here, I was given a cup with directions to \"find\" the water.  If not for a friend who told me to look for a tab near the lemonade, I would have had to go without.  Who knew?  Apparently everyone else, as the rest of my group laughed!  Leaving near dinner time it would have been nice to pick something up to take home, but after seeing so many shuffling in line, I gave up the thought.  It could have turned into another \"water\" expedition, and my friends had left the building."}
{"text":"The things I have done to salads at Panera are probably illegal in some states.

Okay, thats not true. I just really dig in when I am craving a packed salad enough to shell out nearly 9 bucks (rabbits are not cash-rich  you know). From what I can tell this Panera is pretty standard. Enticing menu, maze-like seating area and fairly quick service.

While the employees here are really just super cheery, no amount of happiness hides the fact that at lunch time this place is mobbed. I have more than once been relegated to the bar that is actually IN the ordering line to eat my leafy delight.

Still, if you have a few extra minutes to eat it's a nice change of pace from so many fried, refried & deep fried lunch options in the University area."}
{"text":"I visited this location for lunch with a friend today. It was my first time at this converted location from Paradise Bakery. Last year, I went to a Panera restaurant in Michigan so I already knew the similarity to Paradise Bakery.  My friend and I used the kiosks and chose the Pick Two deal. After a little while, an employee asked us if we had any questions using the kiosks and guided us one at a time through the order prompts. I asked about the contents of the Goddess dressing and if there was a choice with the chips since that information was not on the kiosk. The employee did well with telling me the pesto and contents in the dressing and that there was no choice with the potato chips.  I also asked if the chocolate chip cookie was included and he said no. I also put special instruction language on my order to put dressing on the side.  I got the Goddess salad and cup of chicken noodle soup. This place has the best chicken noodle soup, topping my previous favorites of Denny's and Sweet Tomatoes.  I also got lemonade, changed the side of baguette to chips, and paid a little extra for a chocolate chip cookie. The Goddess Salad was wonderful. I love avocado and the taste. Lemonade and cookie were also good."}
{"text":"Such a great place to get away and do work. I sometimes bring my laptop and work on my freelance. It's a nice quiet area, to focus on studies, work, or just have a casual meal. They recently added Mac & Cheese to their menu... Yom! I usually get the Cobb Salad. Their bagels are pretty dope too. Asiago Bagel w/ Cream Cheese. Mmm..."}
{"text":"Geat healthy food served quickly which is great if you are on a quick break or limited on time. A little expensive but it's hard to find delicious and healthy food these days, especially when its quick. Great alternative to fast food if you are on a diet or simply just trying to be healthy. Employees are also friendly and keep the place very clean. Deducted one star because its a little expensive and they served me expired cream cheese once. However, the manager was apologetic when it was brought to his attention and gave us a coupon for a free meal next time we came."}
{"text":"Curbside to go and didn't check it. Got home to dine, but found hair blatantly visible on and in the food."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER WITH DELIEVERY SERVICE! Especially if you're ordering to a school campus/big area. I usually eat at the cafe which is a decent experience (except they take forever to make the food), but I decided to make a scheduled delivery in time for lunch. Btw, I made this order around 1 and a half to 2 hours ahead of time. The online service \"supposedly\" makes updates for the food. An hour later, no update. So I call the cafe and nobody ever picks up the phone, then I call customer service and they can't reach that cafe either. The customer service was really nice and gave me a coupon for my food and politely told me to wait. I did. Another half an hour passes with no update. I was going to leave campus soon so I needed my food. I tried calling the cafe again AND STILL NO ANSWER. I just gave up and left. I get a text message at 2 that said my food was delivered. IT TOOK TWO HOURS. I wouldn't be complaining if it wasn't a scheduled delivery, but it was. In conclusion, don't order delivery and maybe don't eat here at all."}
{"text":"Love it here!! Sometimes the lines can be long, but what do you expect during lunch time? This staff moves as fast as possible. I don't expect a fast food taste, so I am ok with waiting a little longer for my fresh food. I'm a vegetarian, and when asked about a menu item containing meat, they went and got the manager to verify it was vegetarian. Excellent customer service! I will be continuing to eat my lunches here!"}
{"text":"Honestly the most confusing lunch I've ever had. I wanted to get a flat bread with a side of Mac and cheese and apparently I couldn't order that even though I had sworn I'd seen it on their online menu, the cashier said I had to order them separately with a whole serving of Mac and cheese which would have been like $16 so I just went with the flat bread (it turns out that the menu said if you order a serving a pasta you can get a flat bread as a side, but I had asked for a flat bread with a side of Mac and cheese which was apparently sacrilegious. Then she gave me a table device from the future and didn't explain how it worked, I thought it would just buzz but apparently it gps locator in the maze that is this restaurant. I thought I would try to go to the bathroom which was my biggest mistake. On the bathroom their is a digital screen that asks for a password that's on your receipt. It was locked for a couple minutes so I assumed someone was in there and it was a one person restroom, then out of nowhere a number pad popped up. I entered a 4 digit code and then...nothing. I tried it a couple times, some people behind me tried a couple of times (and then left because it wasn't worth it) and still nothing. Finally I was able to flag down a kid that worked there and he told me that they had printed the wrong passcode on the receipt because it was recently updated and unfortunately because I had tried so many times the door had \"locked\" itself and it would take a couple minutes to open. It wasn't the kids fault, bless his heart he looked like he wanted to die for telling me I couldn't get into the top secret wiz pallace. The best part is when I finally got in (thanks to the help of another employee) the bathroom was super disgusting and I'm not sure what they are gaurding so heavily. And when I got out there was a kid wondering around with my good looking for the stupid gps tracker thing that apparently doesn't buzz to tell you your order is ready. It really was a trip, but I don't think I'll ever do it again."}
{"text":"Never consistent, last order was a take-out, when I unwrapped it, found turkey breast was substituted with lunch meat and had half a head of lettuce to make the sandwich look big.  And they weren't busy!  

Won't be back."}
{"text":"We have been there yesterday and loved it. We had chicken panini from there which was delicious. Staff was helpful and it was pretty neat in there. It's not at all expensive."}
{"text":"I like the food but hate going there. I hate the parking lot and the trampede of people."}
{"text":"Can't pay attention to details on an order. I placed a small catering orders online two different times, and both times they got all of it wrong. Avoid this location"}
{"text":"Just ordered a full ancient grain salad with chicken for $10. It was half the size of the side salad my boyfriend got with his \"pick 2\". The manager gave the server a hard time about portion. She did fix it for me but the manager is an idiot."}
{"text":"I live here. 
Literally. 

I spend HOURS at a time here, taking advantage of their free wifi as I no longer have internet at home. 

I know I over welcome my stays because I'm there long enough to see employee work shifts changeover. Haha. And I gotta love Panera Bread for not giving me the boot! They should consider me a piece of their furniture. They probably already do! 

It's a bit of a drive for me, but well worth it because they let me stay for hours, the food is great and the service is good. Plus the atmosphere is perfect for your lonesome or a group. 

Here are my faves on the menu: 
- the breakfast souffles (Wish these were bigger. I'm always sad when I'm down to the last bite.) 
- chocolate chip muffie (For those who only eat muffin tops!)
- cinnamon chip scone 
- Asian Sesame Salad 

Unfortunately, I have yet to find \"my\" sandwich... I've only tried one of their sandwiches (chicken frontenac) which was good, but it's not \"the one.\" All of my fave items keep on sucking me in so a sandwich isn't my first choice. But we'll see this week... maybe I'll find \"the one\"...."}
{"text":"You caught me. I'm a muffin waster. 

I know y'all out there. We only eat the tops and throw the rest out. But Panera Bread has watcha want and gots watcha need. Muffins sans the bottom, name branded as MUFFIES! For so long I've been waiting for this invention and alas it has arrived. And well worth the (long line up) wait! 

Oh yea, I also had the french onion soup and the bf had the Italian sandwich combo. A little pricey for a light afternoon lunch at  a cafeteria styled restaurant, but still we were content.

But my chocolate chip muffie was indeed the highlight and topping of the cake or should I say the top of the muffin!"}
{"text":"Meh. First things first the parking here is horrible. This Panera is in a crowded strip in Boca Park which is always busy. I came in around 6:30 on a Wednesday evening. I ordered an Asian chicken salad. The young girl who took my order was nice, she asked for my name and said they would let me know when my order was ready. A short time later she started expediting orders, and did not call out any names, thus resulting in me getting the wrong food. Why did you even ask for my name if you weren't going to use it? They quickly remade the salad, but all in all it ended up taking over 30 minutes for me to get my food which is not okay. 

The salad was pretty basic. It had chicken, crispy wonton strips, and a sesame dressing. The dressing was very good, but there was not enough of it. I can't say I have any reason to come back here."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. The employees are not propetly trained and are not familiar with the menu ingredients or prices. Ordering on the phone is an ordeal because the  people who answer have to \"check with the manager\" for any information requested."}
{"text":"Great food & fast service!

I love the Pick 2.

I had the Chipotle Chicken Avocado Melt and Mac and Cheese. I also had the Pumpkin Muffin it was amazing!"}
{"text":"We usually have a good experience at Panera, today was not one. We asked for a big glass of water instead of the tiny Dixie cups they have changed to. As I went to pay we were being charged $3.00 for the cup, without being told that 
Before. I've been eating their food for 15 yrs and have never been charged for a cup. Not happy."}
{"text":"Always so dirty! They've messed my order up multiple times, have been rude to me when I've said something and are inconsistent with every order."}
{"text":"I have not been  here for a couple years and I was so excited when my boyfriend and I decided to go  for lunch because we were in the area. 

This place has gone down hill !   Most of the tables were dirty with empty trays and crumbs. When we finally found a clean spot a girl who looked totally depressed about being there brought our food and it was wrong . Furthmore it looked like someone had just slapped a sandwich together with no care or effort . 

We will not be returning"}
{"text":"Delicious bagels! The cinnamon swirl crunch and the asiago cheese ones are amazing! 

If it wasn't for the bagels I probably wouldn't ever come here though."}
{"text":"Typical Panera. Good food made quick and perfect for lunch. However I want to say the staff at this particular location are great. The location is always very clean and they strive to make sure you're satisfied with your meal. They're always willing to go the extra mile especially for when you've made a large to go order. Always happy with my choice to go here and have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hey, it's just Panera Bread and this chain is about the same as the rest and what you'd expect. 
The over easy egg & cheese on their soft crusty ciabatta bread was a pleasant surprise...I'd will decide to get this more often...It was extra good for a just simple breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"Really great customer service and great food. Especially from gitanjali will come more often"}
{"text":"I know they're a chain, but I gotta admit that I like Panera.  They serve good food and coffee and have free Wi-Fi, but their ambiance is pretty low key and welcoming.  I like the local feel of Murray Avenue, but lots of the places here aren't exactly welcoming, clean, or up-to-date.  Hopefully, places like Panera and Starbucks will put a little pressure on the locals to shape up or ship out.  Until then, I'm glad Panera's here.

I don't think I've ever eaten anything here that I wasn't completely satisfied with, and the chipotle chicken sandwich is outstanding."}
{"text":"Panera Bread is the closest to healthy I'll get! Haha. And to be honest, there really aren't many sit-down restos that serve more healthy food than what's not... Or maybe I just don't notice them cuz all I really want is to stuff my pie-hole with anything deep fried. ;)

These guys have tons of salads, sandwiches and soups to choose from. Plus they have recently added pastas to their menu. What's pretty awesome is they list the calorie count on their menu board. But BEWARE! Before you reach the register to order, you are forced to make eye-contact and stare their fabulous baked goodies such as cookies and pastries in the face. Which I love, but health freaks may not!

There's free wi-fi and trust me when I say, I have pretty much camped out here with my laptop for hours at a time and the staff has never made me feel like I've overstayed my welcome! Panera Bread, you get brownie points for not being intrusive and also for your delicious honey walnut whipped cream cheese!"}
{"text":"Panera Bread has been my favorite restaurant since first trying it back in 2011 and this is my favorite location. Everyone is always friendly and the food is fresh and made with care. I like how eating at Panera makes me feel like I've made a healthy choice, even if something is higher calorie, due to the food being clean and natural. The coffee is delicious and the baked goods are fresh and moist. I would definitely recommend this location to anyone wanting a healthy lunch or a fresh baked pastry. Panera also has some of the best bagels so I usually always get one to take home after having my usual You Pick 2. The food arrives quickly and if anything is made incorrect, they correct it and are very pleasant."}
{"text":"I ordered online and during my very first pick up the cashier sent me on the other side of the restaurant to pick up the food...didn't mention the food is ready at the door on shelves! Then no one made eye contact with me or check on me for 10 minutes. It was lunch rush hour so I didn't want to get in anyone's way until I realized no one was going to help me unless I interrupted...
Long wait, poor service for \"not so good food\" after all and overpriced for the quality. Will not go back to this particular Panera at Green Valley."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Ordered online which was very convenient. Went in and it was ready about 20 seconds after I arrived. Super convenient! But the people didn't even greet me, they just said my name and threw the bag up on the counter. Ok no big deal, I hope the food is at least good. Got home and we were missing a bag of chips. Wife opened her sandwich and it was the wrong bread. In fact it was a bread she hated the most....rye. I actually like rye so I said I would switch bread with her. But she also had a special herb spread she wanted so I ended up with it. So now we both have sandwiches we really didn't want. This place is lacking in the most important areas in having a business....food and customer service. First time eating here also the last. We didn't go back because it was a 15 minute drive. We could have gone to Wild Flower or Paradise Bakery but we wanted to check this place out. A $27.00 mistake."}
{"text":"Not going to lie, Panera Bread on a whole is not my favorite chain type of restaurants to go to. Their bread is fresh enough and the food is okay, but it is pretty expensive for what it is. If I wanted something with a lot of great flavor and unique qualities, I would probably not go to Panera. Eating local is where its at! 

But I do give props when its due. Paneras has a lot more choices than your local deli, because it has lots of soups and pastries too. This Panera's is also really nice because of its convenient location and friendly staff. They are super nice and are pretty quick with the orders. When I have a sick person to take care of and need something quick, this is not a bad option. Chicken noodle soup is good enough to get through a cold. And if the soup isn't enough to get you through, CVS is right across the street so you can pick up some Nyquil."}
{"text":"First timer. I've heard of the famous Bread Bowl and decided to take a wack at it. I visited what it felt like peak hour at 4pm. 

Ordered a Broccoli Cheddar Bread Bowl and although the soup was delicious, the bread was hard and did not taste fresh. I finished the soup inside and went on with my day. 

I also noticed that cleaning is not on their top priority. I saw other customers waiting for a certain table or booth to be cleaned off from the previous customer."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Panara Bread in years, but I decided to give it a shot because I was in the area.  The restaurant is gorgeous, very peaceful, lots of seating,  and clean, but I was kind of underwhelmed. While my ham & swiss sandwich was fine, it was definitely not worth $6.80.  Maybe $4.00 at best. I'm sure that I was paying for the overhead, not for the food.  I know it is a step up from fast food, but I felt like I could have easily made this in my kitchen.  Luckily I came right before the lunchtime rush, so I didn't have to wait in the long line.

I'm sticking to Firehouse for my sandwiches. Oh well, Panara."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but it's also located in an airport, so that could be a reason for that. I really enjoyed their ordering system; while you could wait in line and order in person, they had an alternative system (like their stores) to order from a tablet. I chose this as there wasn't a line and easily ordered a 1/2 salad for myself. You can customize to your heart's desire, so I appreciated a lot of substitutions. After you pay, your name appears on the screen facing customers so you know when to expect your order based on names called before you. 

Becuase I knew I had a little bit of a wait, I went across the aisle and charged my phone. Then, when they called my name, they handed me a bag with my salad and receipt. Overall, a good choice for an airport lunch!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Panera Bread we have ever gone.  They are always out of everything early in the day and they are in desperate need of dependable staff."}
{"text":"I'm not overly impressed wthis panera..food is so so, service is so so, prices warrant better quality and freshness"}
{"text":"The food is good and the coffee is fresh but the staff in the front can be a bit rude. At times we'll go and the person at the counter is bored and disconnected while we give our orders. Due to this, I've often received the wrong order. The kitchen staff gladly correct the mistake and give me a new sandwich but it is kind of disappointing having to wait twice as long for your food simply due to the counter staff not paying attention to the order. I go here for convenience but it is not my favorite Panera location. Another drawback is that the condiment counter is frequently empty and I have to ask the kitchen staff for mayonnaise or butter."}
{"text":"This isn't my favorite Panera location but I visit every now and then due to convenience. The staff out front are not very attentive and are often borderline rude. The sandwich makers are friendly enough, but they often get the sandwich order wrong and I have to send it back to get it remade. The soup here is very good, actually better than other locations and they always have a large selection of bagels while many other locations are picked over by mid to late afternoon. The food takes much longer to come out than at other locations even when they are not busy. The coffee is usually fresh but sometimes we have to remind them to make fresh because the pots that are out have been sitting for 2 hours. I will continue to eat here out of convenience but not by choice."}
{"text":"Apparently Panera doesn't carry any form of peppers to put on salads or sandwiches? Paradise sure did. Over $6 for a kids meal if your kids want a drink. Just seems really overpriced for what you get. 

I ordered the half Greek salad and it was pretty disappointing. You know what would've helped? Peppers."}
{"text":"By far one of my favourite places to eat lunch! Whether I'm in Markham or in Aurora, I always seem to gravitate toward Panera. The dessert lunches are delicious but the bagels are even better. On Tuesdays, they do Baker's Dozen and you can get 13 bagels for the price of 12. While it's not a huge special promo, an extra bagel is always a good idea. They're cream cheese is also very good. 

My lunch go-to is usually the pick 2! You can choose two items on the menu for a cheaper price. The Mac & Cheese and a soup are my usuals but I'm really loving the summer corn chowder right now. In the winter, I'm about the broccoli  and cheese soup! Also the steak sandwich is another great choice! 

Whether you're eating in or taking it to go, this is a great spot to grab a delicious and healthy lunch, dinner or breakfast! It's pricier than Tim's or McD but sometimes you just gotta treat yo self!"}
{"text":"I used a kiosk to check out. I sat waiting for my order the screen showed they were preparing and then it was ready. There was people going up to get orders and the staff were just rude. And a member of crew and other of the crew were fighting in front of us. You need to handle that on your own time don't fight in front of customers!!! As i finally got my food i look at my bread when i get back to work and it looks like this. They did not cut it, it looks have eaten i just threw it away because i was disgusted. They make me hate Panera with this experience."}
{"text":"It's strange that I'm writing a 2-star review for the place I frequent so much....

I've been going here for a couple of years and I've gotten to know the staff and they're friendly.  The problems I have aren't with them or the taste of the food, it's just the system that they have set up at Paradise.

I go in the mornings and nearly everyone stops at the bagels/coffee cashier.  The line can be 5 or 6 people deep at times.  They usually just have 2 people handling the area which isn't that bad, but if you look to your right you see an army of employees doing prep work in the salad/lunch area.  Why not give one employee the ability to hop over and help out the area that's busy during a rush?  It's frustrating to see 90% of the customers in one area and 90% of the employees in another area.

Unless you're the first one to use a table/booth in the morning, be prepared to bus and wipe down your own table before using it.  The place is kid friendly, so if you get a booth be prepared to wipe the crumbs off the seat, too.  Like with the other things, it appears it's a management issue and not an employee choice.

Parking....  It's as bad as everyone says.  The center is severely under parked and trucks will often clog up the rear alley for deliveries.  If you go during a busy time it's not surprising to find no parking available....at all.

Those are the negatives and they can sometimes hit you all at once.  It takes a while to find a parking spot, you get inside and have to wait for a simple coffee, then you have to clean your own table before using it. Not good.  

That being said, if you know when to go and what to do then it's a great option....heh.  I go in the very early morning so everything is clean and there aren't any lines.  Parking is a breeze.  Every booth has a power outlet so you can bring your laptop, get comfortable, and spread out.  Free refills on coffee and soda and you can choose your own, plus the cream/milk are always filled.  The bagels are great, so are the sweets.  Really friendly staff, free wifi.

The odd thing is that if you show up 2 hours later you might have a completely different experience...."}
{"text":"Panera is good for that quick, \"I'm craving something with variety but I don't want to spend too much money,\" kind of meal.

They have tons of pastries, bagels, and breads to choose from, hence the name Panera Bread, lol. I usually don't order the pastries or breads from here, though.

I go straight to ordering a You Pick 2. I usually choose a broccoli cheddar soup in a cup and half of a kale chicken cesar salad with added avocado. MUST TRY THEIR GREEN TEA! It's sooooo good. Their lemonade is great as well. Practically, most of their drinks are usually on point.

Also! If you download the Panera app, you can send in an order, pay with Apple Pay or credit card via the app, then go right into the restaurant and pick it up on a shelf when it's ready! I have yet to come across a food thief via this method and I hope I don't in the near future. But this option is EXTREMELY convenient for those who are short on time or who just hate waiting forever for their food."}
{"text":"Food and service was great. But  it is not family friendly. There is no changing station in the men's room."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have had a family-size to-go order completely wrong and disgusting when I got home. The bagel I ordered for tomorrow's breakfast is so stale it made a \"thud\" on the counter (gross!), I wanted two sides of bread and an apple and got 3 stale pieces of bread, and ordered a sandwich with no tomatoes and opened up a mess of a steak sandwich with soggy tomatoes. I feel sorry for subjecting my family to this disaster. I called the manager Patrick and he was less than interested in his store's lack of quality. Never again, Panera."}
{"text":"Always delicious but AHMED provided excellent customer service. Professional, attentive, and accommodating. He's an asset to this location! Give him a raise, promote him, keep him around Panera Bread!!!"}
{"text":"I generally have decent experiences with Paradise Bakery, however it was my first time in this location, and the lady who I was greeted by was clearly very \"over\" her job for the day. I was standing in front of the menu when she walked up to her register and stared at me. I told her I couldn't decide between a bagel or a sandwich to which she replied \"Well breakfast is over so you can get bagels and scones\" .... I hadn't mentioned breakfast besides a bagel. There was a lady standing next to me with her daughter waiting to order, she asked if we were together. When we told her no, she rolled her eyes and let out a big sigh and took their order of a bagel and prepared it. The lady and her daughter took a seat, so when she turned around to ask if it was for here or to go and they weren't there, she rolled her eyes once again and muttered \"uh ok then.\" Also,  It wasn't a huge deal, but I did feel that she could have taken my order and let me go pay after she put the bagel into toast, instead of completely preparing it. The other employees were nice, and my chicken tortellini Alfredo was good, and I also had a half sandwich (roasted turkey and avocado BLT) so I don't want to rate too low, the lady in the bakery area could just use some people skills."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Panera Bread ever. I go in tonight order a salad they ask do you want chips,apple or bread? I say bread they tell me they are out of bread I mean come on it say bread in your name and no bread. This isn't the first time another time I went in and wanted a salad they didn't have the lettuce for that salad like really I'll never go back to this one again."}
{"text":"I've waited 10 minutes for a bread bowl soup...seriously?! It's super slow and no one else is in line! The whole time the manager and employees have kept looking at me standing here and no one has bothered to ask me if I need any help. I finally had to speak up to get some service. This place was great before new management came in."}
{"text":"I eat soup I can always depend on my chicken noodle soup to be good and my turkey chili is good with onions and cheese but the corn is getting in the way just a little too much corn. I'll still order the turkey chili hopefully they will consider a little less corn."}
{"text":"I always like to stop at Panera when I'm looking to pick up something to eat while on the go without opting for something unhealthy. I typically am the type of person to grab and go, but it's a nice space if you want to sit, eat, and catch up on some work or do some studying. 

You really can't go wrong with any of their soups, salads, or sandwiches and the staff are always friendly. I personally opt for the 'Pick 2' menu option where you can pick a sandwich and soup or pair a sandwich with a salad. If you're in a rush, or have time to kick back, check out Panera."}
{"text":"We order regularly from this shop for events on our Campus. They are always on time orders are accurate and they remember to get us all the details to make the catering experience easy and effortless. Kudos to their delivery persons and manager at the store for always working with us and providing excellent customer service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Let me start off with saying I usually love panera bread! However this location has really gone down hill rather fast. The service isn't good and they always get my order wrong. Tonight I ordered a to go order at 7:20 which gave me a 8pm wait time. It is 9:20 and it's still not here. I've had to follow up with panera instead of the manager calling me which is crazy and they offered me no discount for inconvenience when I called or anything. I ordered a sandwich and Mac n cheese. They called to say they're out of the pastry I ordered but didn't offer a refund. I will not be returning.  Update!!! Food was so cold when I got it at 9:40.... 2 hours after I ordered it and 40 minutes after they closed!"}
{"text":"Always a wonderful quick meal.  I had the new beef chili, which was very good. Small bowl was just enough for lunch with some chips.  The service here is always excellent.  The free wifi is a bonus."}
{"text":"I usually love panera because they have so many vegetarian options. I just got my order and my flatbread had chicken."}
{"text":"We used to really love this place, that is before it moved and became Panera. The service has gone downhill are the employees are always scrambling around in the kitchen like they've had no training whatsoever. The communication skills here are very poor and the staff and management could benefit from some teambuilding exercises. Communication is key, if you can't communicate from the order taking through the presentation to the customer, something needs to change.
I may try this place in the future but first I think I'll give them time to get their poop together. 3 strikes you're out."}
{"text":"This location is always out of the food I order from the Panera Bread app. When I get the food it's great but there's always some issue 1 out of the 3 times I get there. At this point I'm ready to uninstall the app and quit going to Panera Bread altogether."}
{"text":"Rest stop Panera, but the same kind of quality you would normally expect. Getting bread bowls was probably not the greatest of ideas for a multi-hour drive on the Ohio Turnpike (LOL) but it was good nonetheless. The food seemed fresh as it does at every other location, and it came out quick at the rest area. And again, like all locations the food is generally overpriced. Oh well, tastes good and beats paying $9 for a Burger King combo because the food is better."}
{"text":"Not sure what the low star rating is for here. I didn't read everyone's reviews but I really had no worries here. The food was good as always and the customer service was promptly attentive to take my order. Wasn't really happy with working the iPad ordering tool so I went to the person which took my order correctly. Minutes after ordering and taking my seat, to my surprise, my food was delivered to the table, that's a plus and haven't seen that anywhere for Panera. I noticed no trashcans around but patrons that recently left had their trash still on the table. So they come around and clean up after you as well. I did use the restroom and not sure if it was dirty like it was for long but some idiot had terrible aim around the toilet. (#1 not #2) the layout was different so it didn't quite feel like a Panera but this place delivered. I was satisfied."}
{"text":"Terribly disappointed.  Loved this place when it was Paradise Bakery.  I have eaten here only twice and each time  was disappointed on the food.  Although edible, nothing good, much less great.  I have even walked out on a couple of occasions just due to the disappointing looks of their bakery goods.  Bring back Paradise Bakery."}
{"text":"I am disappointed that they turned Paradise Bakery into Panera.  The sandwiches Suck!  They don't carry fire roasted tomato soup.  The cookies at not the same.  The seating is odd.  I will no longer frequent  this chai because it is now a Panera garbage. ."}
{"text":"Cashier/order taker was very rude and didn't understand what I wanted at all. Ordered a pork carnitas sandwich and it had less than a tablespoon of meat on it. Only lettuce and tomato. Will not return to this panera, worst one I have ever been to."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming here in maybe 5 years?! I don't Live on this side of town anymore but I was in the area. I forgot how amazing this place is. Everything looked good on the menu & it was so difficult to decide. The pastries were mouth watering. The staff is beyond friendly! Can't wait to come back. It's so relaxing :)"}
{"text":"Haven't been in a Panera  Bread for awhile. There is a optional new way to order without standing in line. They have kiosks where you can order complete meal, pay, take a beeper to your table and they will bring it out to you. Thought that was pretty cool. Store was very clean and employees very friendly. I ordered the Steak Panini which has swiss cheese and horseradish dressing. A really awesome sandwich even though it was a little light on the steak. My wife got a turkey sandwich that had the meat falling out of bread but I could see plenty of  bread when I opened it up. New hours, 6-10 m-f and 7-10 Sunday."}
{"text":"It's better than fast food but I think since this is a new location, maybe they are still working out the kinks. I've had 2 orders in the drive thru and was missing a sandwich on one occasion and a soup on another. You always have to check your bag before you drive off. There is a lack of attention to detail...missing croutons for the soup, chips instead of the ordered bread, and avocado with lots of brown spots. Not the greatest, but each time I have come here, it gets better."}
{"text":"clean, quick and good food. got a free apple?"}
{"text":"As a Panera first timer, I was a bit stressed out with all the options (everyone hates being the new person holding up the line), but everyone, especially mike, was so helpful! They gave us additional menus, they let us sample their different breads, their chips, their drinks, and they even threw in free drinks to accommodate my stressful nature. And when asked why they were all so nice, they laughed in surprise. Before even trying the food, the customer service of his place has me hooked."}
{"text":"I had the chance to dine here for breakfast for the first time today, this Saturday 2/11.  I've been to Panera many times before, but always for lunch.  I do not know why, but when I think of weekend breakfast spots to try, Panera Bread is usually not on the top of my list of places to go.  However, due to the fact that my gf had a gift card we decided to give it a shot.

Service - Service was amazing, prompt, polite, friendly, etc.  I could go on for days, I'll  just sum it up by saying, the place has damn good customer service.  

Food:  I ordered a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich on a bagel.  It was good not great.  I'd prefer the same breakfast sandwich from a place like Bruegger's or Einstein's.  Bacon didn't have much flavor to me.  The sandwich wasn't bad by any means, it was just ok.  We also ordered a blueberry muffin and a pecan/cinnamon roll.  The Blueberry muffin was great!  The pecan/cinnamon roll on the other hand was not so great.  It did not taste fresh at all.  I feel like it may have been made a day or two ago.  

Drink:  We ordered a strawberry smoothie before we left.  Both my gf and I loved it.  It had fresh strawberries and yogurt all mixed together.  It was cold, fresh and delicious.  No complaints there.   

Other:  -Free WiFi
-Plenty of free parking
-Great salads
-Great service
-Clean"}
{"text":"Great food and service, just like every other Panera. The reason for the 3 stars, is that they need more electric outlets in the dining area! Considering that during the day, a majority of their customers are there to work or have a meeting, the shortage of outlets is unacceptable. By my quick count, I think there is only four outlets in the entire dining room."}
{"text":"All I have to say is WOW...and not in a good way! I use to absolutely love this place when it was Paradise Bakery. Then came the sad day when Panera swooped in! . Three weeks ago I came in and ordered a BOWL of soup, a whole sandwich without avocado or lettuce (due to severe allergies), and a cookie. When I got back to my office I realized they had instead given me a CUP with the wrong soup, a HALF sandwich with EXTRA avocado and lettuce, and no cookie. Additionally they had not attached my receipt. I called immediately (less than 5 minutes after leaving) and they remembered my order but said that they would not be able to refund me or provide the correct food \"per policy\" b/c I would be unable to return until after I got off work (despite their receipts saying the contrary)but that they would send me a coupon. THREE weeks later I finally get the coupon and when I take it in today they try to pull this \"policy\" crap again stating that the coupon will not allow me to obtain the full sandwich or cookie I originally paid for (despite the coupon being good for $15). After arguing with the cashier she finally gets a manager that reluctantly (and rather rudely) finally approves the order they owe me. When I finally got the food they still forgot the roll and STILL put lettuce on it despite the receipt saying NO lettuce! I so wish paradise bakery would return and get rid of this poor impersonation that has taken its place!!"}
{"text":"This place is busy, and the service has improved recently. Orders take 5 to 10 min. Not bad for me. 

Wifi is good and plenty of healthy food offerings. Great place for a small group meeting"}
{"text":"The food here is great but I just can't seem to try anyting else except the turkey cranberry sandwich. that sandwich gets me every time. breakfast is great too!!"}
{"text":"out of souffle by 10 am. but I gotta give him props for bringing our breakfast out to our table, which was pretty cool. Food is about the same as any other Panera. This is one of their bigger stores with a lot of square footage I'm very interesting decor. Very clean looking and the staff appears to be quite attentive."}
{"text":"I'm a Panera fan but this location is disappointing. An item in our rapid pickup order was incorrect and another item was missing. Rather than offering to replace the items we paid for but never received, management offered nothing. Just thanked me for my feedback."}
{"text":"The good:

What can I say - Good Coffee, Good Soups/Salads, Good Sandwiches, Good Pastries. Lots of seating options.Friendly service. Quick lunch option. Order your lunch online and pay in advance to use the express pick up service. 

The downside: 

Wifi is really slow, sometimes people sit there all day working like it's their office which cuts down on the number of tables available - this location seems to have more of that because of it proximity to businesses in the area.

Lunch time rush can be pretty hectic and the parking lot is shared with the ATT store and some other stores that have a lot of traffic, so finding a spot is not always easy."}
{"text":"I go to the one in Robinson Twp near Burgatory !  The only problem I have is with their Rewards Card they said it wasn't Recognized in their system but when I go online to Register it , it says the Card is already Registered !!!

I now have Two Rewards Cards and am about ready to Scream from the RoofTops !!!
Someone Please Solve my Problem !!!"}
{"text":"I'd heard people rave about Panera Bread so the spouse went and got the half steak and cheese and chicken noodle soup. When he presented it to me I was stunned. What I got was a big piece of hard bread, a steak sandwich made with hard bread on the outside and sort of soft on the inside with a little piece of steak sitting in melted cheese positioned on one end of the bread. With a small piece of meat sitting on one end of the bread! That's not a sandwich. That's just bread with a dollop of steak. The chicken noodle soup was mostly broth with just a bit of noodles, carrots, celery and chicken, all way over cooked. The soup tasted good though. The veggies should not be that soft. Needless to say I didn't enjoy this meal and was still hungry after I had to pull apart the sandwich to make the bread accommodate the little piece of steak. It's amazing what people will pay for just because it's called \"healthy\"!"}
{"text":"Try soba noodles with asiago toasted bagel with butter...soo good..... also order chicken and  rice soup is so creamy like corn chowder....dip your bread in the soup, then eat it....sooo goood...."}
{"text":"Not the best service anymore.  At one point this was a good Panera, but the poor customer service from the untrained staff they have working in there makes my most recent experiences, overall frustrating.

I have witnessed unprofessional behaviors by girls who are called \"managers\" too - who treat the teens working there like garbage.  I just think teens deal with enough \"bullying\" in high school, without having to go to work only to be treated the same way by people they are supposed to look up to."}
{"text":"By far the most disappointing Panera bread. We come here to get soups and salads for convince as it's on the way home and there is a drive through. More times than not we get home and they completely butcher what we order and don't get what we pay for. I know I should now check the bag but that shouldn't have to become a habit."}
{"text":"The food was good however the customer service sucks. The girl that rang me up was very bitter!! I would not recommend eating here. Worst experience I've had at a fast food restaurant, never shopping here again."}
{"text":"Delicious salads, sandwiches and soups! Bakery is also amazing-- very nice place for lunch and conversation, not too loud."}
{"text":"Decided to try Panera Bread for lunch.  I have heard great things so I guess my expectations where high.  Parking was a nightmare.  Got there and waited in line to order.  I got a soup and salad with a drink.  First disappointment was they had no Coke products, only Pepsi.  Second disappointment was the Pepsi was out of order.  I got unsweetened black tea that was very cloudy and tasted old.  I sat at my table as instructed and waited for my food to be delivered.  A girl delivered my food and I asked how I get silverware.  She said it's with your food.l and left.  All I got was a plastic spoon.  No fork or knife for my salad.  I got up but could not find silverware.  I waited at the counter to get silverware and was finally given a metal fork and a plastic knife.  The employee seemed irritated I asked for silverware.  I sat back down to eat but then I could not find salt or pepper.  I got up and looked for salt and pepper but could not find any.  I again waited at the counter to ask where I get salt and pepper.  I was finally helped and told it was under the soft drink machine.  My salad and soup were good when I finally got to eat them.  However, the service was awful, the employees I encountered were stressed and rude.  I do not recommend Panera Bread and I will not return.  I can go to Zupas and have a much better experience for less money."}
{"text":"This place has been a hot mess lately! I usually don't review franchises businesses.  But they ran out of bowls for single cups, baked potato soup, they use plastic spoons and metal forks in the same meal, the staff is always confused, the place is always a mess.  What's going on?!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped into the formerly Paradise Bakery now known as Panera Bread.  I'm pretty sure they're owned by the same company because not much has changed, even the menu. What I do like about Panera over Paradise is that we do not have to stand in a long line (sometimes) and wait for our food to arrive. Now they give you a pager and they bring your food to you. 

It is the same exceptional food and service given as Paradise. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch or breakfast. The menu is pretty basic but it has some twists...it's sandwiches, salads and soups and pastries, breads, etc.  Right now I'm into their turkey cranberry panini, and I love most of their salads and panini options. They have vegetarian options, and the calorie counts are posted on the menu, which I love."}
{"text":"Deliciously simple & sweet. Loved the mac & cheese & my turkey / avocado sandwich was filling. Lovely choice of teas, coffee, and pop. The desserts are great as well. 

Clean atmosphere in a convenient location."}
{"text":"Clean, the bread is always warm, staff is super courteous. I've been here a few times to study for an exam. Staff is always walking around to make sure the place is clean and presentable for the next customer. They even pick up my tray sometimes when I'm too lazy to leave the books to put up my tray. Lots of windows for natural light. Quiet area."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. It's always clean. The staff is nice. The food is fresh. I love the strawberry poppyseed salad...probably my favorite thing on the menu. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"This is the longest I've ever had to wait on a \"rapid\" pick up order. I ordered before I got here and been waiting 20 minutes since I've been in the restaurant. Still waiting..."}
{"text":"I usually order Panera once a month, never had any issues with the food or service. Today I order a sandwich and I had to open it up because it was just two slices of bread and dressing, sure enough it had nothing but a few shreds of chicken and one measly piece of avocado. It was such a let down, I know I won't be going back to this location, I'll travel the distance to the next store. See photo posted."}
{"text":"This place is just off Dundas Square! It hides near gift shops so go look for it! From the outside it looks classy, as you enter the welcome is good! Great selection of bread and bagels and really nice coffee! A good start to any day... Free wifi helps too, this is standard in most places though. The staff here are really nice and the place has a customer base that's good to sit and chat to - unlike some other 'popular' coffee shops! One thing they could improve on, getting the tables cleared quicker..."}
{"text":"Panera has been a favourite of mine since grad school days back east.  The menu is simple: soups, salads, sandwiches and baked goods.  You can get the \"you pick 2\" special, which nabs you a half sandwich and soup, a soup and salad, or a half sandwich and salad.  Calorie listings are posted next to the item on the overhead menu, either guilting you or tempting you in your food choices.  I came here with my parents, both of whom are very VERY picky eaters and not shy about asking lots of questions.  Thank you to the very nice and patient staff for not rolling their eyes!  :)  I've never had a problem with food or service in all the times I've visited a Panera location.  Free wifi only makes a visit more pleasant!"}
{"text":"What can I say?  A chain bakery cafe that is fairly consistent, in my experience, and employs friendly staff.  Bread is very good, ingredients are fresh, and prices aren't break-the-bank high.  I like the fact that the calorie amounts are listed on the menuboard; for some, that may ruin a dining experience, but for me, it's a useful tool to watch my food intake (especially since I spend most of my days sitting on a piano bench)!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this Panera between classes. Staff has always been great whenever I come in. They are always friendly and let me know what my Panera card benefits are before I pay. The parking lot gets full around lunch time, but outside seating is awesome when the weather is nice. It is a nice place to study."}
{"text":"This Panera is close to me and super convenient, I've eaten here for all meals of the day. They have a pretty standard menu and fresh pastries in the morning. I went in with some friends and was surprised that they don't allow you to get a side of avocado, yet have it on their menus. I can't have dairy and have been trying to eat less meat, so I was a little disappointed with their a la carte options."}
{"text":"I have ordered the bagal and the greek yogert with mixed berries. The yogurt is fine but not that surprisingly good. I have not tried the bagal yet. It looks fine."}
{"text":"Sooooooooooooooo Happy! 

I was (insert above text) to see Panera in Canada. Used to go here all the time when I lived in Chicago. The food is exactly the same. I would suggest the soups as a must. Especially the Broccoli Cheddar in a bread bowl! Most of the sandwiches are very good. The salads are hearty and delicious.


To top off everything you can get your soup with an apple! instead of more bread. And not just some crappy apple, my apples have always been crisp and juicy."}
{"text":"Manager named Matt very receptive to suggestions. Food is OK. Needs to teach the help not to grab the coffee cups or water glasses on the lip of the glass. I don't want to drink the servers DNA.
Otherwise he is very helpful and good employee. Panera should continue to keep him happy"}
{"text":"This morning I watched as an employee handled his cell phone bare handed in the food prep area before then handling and putting food into boxes without washing or gloves for myself and likely all to go customers. I addressed this with a manger and was given my money back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great location. Love their soups and as an added bonus they have a drive-thru which comes in handy. Overall great food and decent service. Been here a couple times and have never had any major issues besides the normal \"we are out of bread bowls\" lol."}
{"text":"Ordered Delivery and was told about half hour 45 min... Ok that's not bad. An hour later I called and was told my foods out and should be there any min now. Nothing! One hour and 45 mins later still no food so I call again and was told the same thing. Will never order form here again! They never completed the order or made it!! So I wasted 2 hours of my time and no compensation was offered!"}
{"text":"I like this place, just a little pricey.  $1.29 for cream cheese....whew!

Service is very nice.  Wifi, and has plugs."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service, fast easy and nice establishment. I would definitely dine here over many surrounding restaurants in the area. Bread bowl with soup is the best thing! Also their fresh lemonade is superb!"}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery is one of those places that you can count on for always having something good when your driving around wanting more than a burger and not a sit down meal with a waiter. 
I love the Cranberry Turkey sandwich with fresh fruit. The nice thing to consider is that you can get a whole or a half on the sandwich of your choice.
Once you feel good about the healthy choices you've made you encounter the cookie section at the register. All I'm going to say is that the chocolate chip is to die for!! The chocolate chips just melt in your hands!! Doesn't get any better than that!! 
Paradise Bakery does also have a great breakfast should you want a nice place to go after a nice hike or just want to treat yourself and a friend to great place to visit. 
Put Paradise Bakery on your \"always good\" list!!"}
{"text":"The service here was not very good. They were out of arugula for my sandwich and did not let me know ahead of time. They did not have regular coffee. When I asked I was told after 2:00 we don't brew anymore so I was stuck with hazelnut or decaf.  The attitudes of the staff was subpar. 
This used to be a paradise bakery and the crew was amazing. Too bad."}
{"text":"Friday night must not be their night!  Before boarding my plane I ordered food from Panera.  I found it rather unnerving that they didn't have what I wanted, and pretty much what everyone else ordered.  I kid you not, every 3 minutes one of the ladies behind the counter would yell, \"QUESTION FOR So-And-So!\" I was standing close to the counter so I overheard every time they called for So-And-So they said they were out of whatever they ordered and if a substitution could be made.  Not cool.  I expected them to call my name a few times.  If you don't have a certain item on your menu, why don't you cross it out, or invest in magnets to put over you menu board?

Another issue I had is that the 1/2 sandwich I ordered had horseradish on it.  I couldn't eat it and had to give it to my husband, and the 1/2 soup that I wanted they didn't have.  (Had to resort to chili, which was just okay.  I could've eaten better from a can.)  

If you're in Terminal C of Sky Harbor go somewhere else other than Panera Bread."}
{"text":"I like coming here to chill and to get a bite to eat. There's always room to sit somewhere, and the staff are all super friendly. If you stay in and order the staff will bring food to you. 

I have the panera card. I go here at least once a week and I'm always getting something for free! Whether it's a coffee or a pastry.

I love the pastries and the bagels! Panera makes the best chocolate chip cookies and the bear claw is delicious too. The Cheese and Jalapeno bagels are the best. If you asking for a to go bagel, make sure to ask them for knife to spread the cream cheese, because they sometimes forget. 

I enjoyed the soup bread bowl, the bread had a nice crunch to and it was fresh. The chili had a good flavour to it. However the bread to chili ratio wasn't good. There was too much bread, and not enough chili. The sandwhiches are decent. I had the Cuban sandwhich is was okay, but probably not something I would order again. I'll have to try some of the other sandwhiches, and soups another time to see if they are good."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times when we visit Arizona and I have to say that it's always a pleasant meal. No huge surprises or stunning food, but definitely tasty for a soup and sandwich sort of lunch. Salad is good, sandwich good... but the cookies are great. It's just the sort of place to go when you don't want to fuss about too much. Just eat the sandwich!"}
{"text":"Coffee is good. Desserts are good. Pastry is good. Second floor space is very spacious and welcoming. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"There are so many better places to grab a bite. Salads are limp, with little besides lettuce, and a few sad-looking excuses for tomatoes or whatever else is supposed to be in the salad. Soups and sandwiches are bland and boring. Seriously, it's like they're trying to make bad food. 

I'm so dispirited at the thought of this place that I can't even finish this review."}
{"text":"It is rare to find a friendly employee.  Sometimes the wild rice chicken soup is burned. They change the menu frequently and have gotten rid of salads I like 3 times. I recently tried a tomato caprese flatbread and it was a soggy mess."}
{"text":"The good: Their bagels are always fresh and pretty good, the coffee is almost always full and the service is friendly...

The bad: The service is SSSLLLOOOWWW!  I know this isn't fast food but damn...  Is it lack of training or lack of help?  I walked in today and there were 2 people in front of me.  It took a FULL 10 minutes for someone to take my order.  There are almost always 2 servers at the front 'breakfast' registers and there are always at least 3 others floating around going in & out of the back kitchen that never help the servers.  What's up with them?  Who are they?  Why don't they ever help out?  

Noticing another yelper mentioned Settlers Ridge and I'll be going there from now on..."}
{"text":"Their food is pretty good, but overpriced for what you get. And if you order anything online don't bother customizing it. You won't get what you ordered."}
{"text":"I have been through the drive thru a couple of times since this restaurant has opened.  The staff has been friendly but it feels like the portion size has gotten smaller.

I finally made it inside for breakfast.  I was so disappointed in many ways.  I will discuss in the order I experienced them.

- The bathroom was dirty and there were no paper towels.  I also want to mention that the napkin dispensers in the restaurant were empty as well and I had to ask the cashier for something to dry my hands with.

- My favorite breakfast sandwich is gone.  It's been replaced by a very small bacon, egg and cheese sandwich were all you can taste is the cheese.  The portion size was way too small, I ended up hitting the Chic-fil-A drive thru afterwards.

- The decor...  When I was in design school I spent 4 hours studying the previous location.  The problems with the customer flow, noise levels, space utilizations, etc.  I wonder if someone from the company saw my report and said \"you think this is bad, well we can make it worse!!\"  The only thing the improved was the cashier area.  No longer is money exchanged over (and dropped on) pastries that are going to be served to customers.  The seating area is cramped and there are few places that a large group can sit.  There is also no out of the way areas for people who want or need some privacy.  I have been to many Panera Bread across the US and people like to come there for business lunches, informal business meetings, study groups and to read.  This location is not set up for those types of activities.  It's also very loud.  Not only is everyone so close together but the volume of the music needs to be turned down. 

Overall the experience will not have be going to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"I go here because I love the locations I normally visit in NY HOWEVER, the service and food here is a bit different. For some reason, most times that I have gone here, they have either forgotten something or messed something up...Once it was a burnt panini and another time is was my sides...I will say that the manager always resolves whatever issue comes up and the food is still pretty good. Good deals if you have their loyalty card--always get some sort of coupon when I visit!"}
{"text":"So glad to finally have Panera here in AZ! Paradise just does NOT do it for me. 
This was my first time at this location, stopped in for lunch around noon to place a to-go order and OHMYGAWD was it busy! It was a zoo!
I personally really like the quick-order station at the front, you can browse the menu and make your selection without feeling pressured/rushed, swipe your card, and make your way to the pick-up station. Really efficient! There's a digital sign which keeps you updated on the progress of your order and they also have alphabetized cubbies where you can locate your online order or if you missed your name. 
I was in and out in 10 mins. My only complaint is that the lady passing out the to-go orders was not very friendly. I witnessed it with another customer, and then when she mispronounced my name (happens ALLLL the time) I politely corrected her and smiled, and she just glared at me! Lady, I get you're busy but if you hate your life that much maybe look for employment that is not customer focused!? That really bugs me. 
I read some complaints about to-go orders being wrong, and I can see why... it seemed like mass chaos back there! they were incredibly busy and for what it's worth, to my non-restaurant-industry-experienced-eyes it looked like they were doing the best they could.
Food was good, I had the kale Caesar salad and black bean soup. I will admit that my order WAS slightly incorrect... I requested an apple as my side instead of the bread, and they sent me home with my apple AND a cookie (good kharma??) so you do NOT hear me complaining at all... and they get four stars!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a cup of tea and a danish. The pricing is fair but the new remodel is less than comfortable. I do like the soup and sandwiches they are really tasty and super fresh. I would also suggest the oatmeal with fresh fruit. This is also a great place to meet friends or a business meeting."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????
??????????????????????????????????????????IP?????????HP????????????HP?????????????????????????????????????
????????????????????????????????????2?????????
????????????????????????????????????????????????
???????????"}
{"text":"Not only do they slap these \"sandwiches\" together sloppier than a taco hell burrito. They overlook any customization they specifically ask you might want to make. The best part is the guy who's only job is to check the order and literally  puts a check mark next to each item. Nothing like wiped off mayo on a $10 sandwich."}
{"text":"The service here has progressively gone downhill. On my last visit I placed an online order for a dozen bagels with cream cheese. I arrived at the restaurant and my order wasn't prepared. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they ran out of certain items, but my phone number and email address should be attached to my profile. A call should have been the minimum I'd expect to notify me they couldn't fulfill my order. Today I placed an order for 18 bagels and a brioche sausage egg and cheese sandwich. I arrived and picked up my order. When I got home I discovered the sandwich had no sausage on it. I drove back to the restaurant. The restaurant wasn't even busy. They remade my sandwich and at a minimum should have rechecked for accuracy. I get in my car look at the sandwich and discovered this time they omitted the egg. Walk back in ask to speak to a manager. She was very unaccommodating and pretty nonchalant. They refunded my $ but the final sandwich was still wrong. I specified over hard on the egg but got an runny yolk sandwich. I can live with that. The pickup area is very dirty and in disarray. The walls definitely need to be scrubbed and restocked. Not coming here again."}
{"text":"No longer serve turkey/cranberry sandwich and took out the cookie with your meal which was the 2nd disappointing part.   But broccoli cheddar is to die for."}
{"text":"I stopped at Panera Bread on Richmond Rd this afternoon for 2 Strawberry Poppyseed chicken salads. We went to eat them later and there were no strawberries in either salad. I called back and the employee who answered offered to have me drive back the 4 miles each way to get the strawberries (what?). Last time I visited they left out the chicken and I did drive back to get the all important chicken. I will not drive back again, nor will I bother to stop by in the first place. Please improve your quality control."}
{"text":"We decided to stop at Panera for an early dinner, we walked in and there were maybe 4 tables of people. There is no signage where to order so we went opposite of the sign that says \"pay here\". I tried to order Mac and cheese and was told they didn't have any. My mom tried to order broccoli soup and was told they didn't have any. We tried to order salads and were told to order them \"down there\" so we walked 10 feet and ordered our salads from the same server. So random. The service was very slow despite probably 6-7 people behind the counter. When we asked to get our drink cups the server said, \"go ahead\" pointing to the stack of cups. The service was confusing and frustrating. 
The only time I saw a manager was when she came out to verify the 100.00 bill we gave was real. *eye roll*  The salads were great though! Just need better training and add a couple signs of where to go. We watched several other couples come in and look lost, I'm sure we looked the same."}
{"text":"This is the worst Paradise Bakery I have been too. Mike and I came here last Friday night primarily to get some chicken noodle soup since he was feeling under the weather. 

We get here and immediately someone tells us that this has been the night from hell and that they are out of a lot of stuff. Ok, thank you for welcoming me into your establishment. 

We asked for a club and were told that the croissants were cooling. Ok, how long until they are ready? Response, \"I don't know. A loooong time. But we can get it for you if you wait, but not if you are getting a to go order.\" So no croissants for us. I wanted a panini. Only one was available even though three were listed online for the menu for this location. They were out of one kind and I was told that they didn't offer the other even though it was listed as an option online. Fine, I took the only one they had. I then went to get a mixed greens salad and they were out of mixed greens and tomatoes. Who knows what else they were out of that we didn't ask for. 

All the kids who were working here looked miserable to have to be explaining this to customers and be put in this situation. Where was management? No where to be seen."}
{"text":"Second time I've gotten home and my order is wrong. Guess it's my own fault for trusting them, but they left out an entire salad this time."}
{"text":"I think the food is decent at best and very over priced.  If I wanted to spend $15 on a meal, I would go some where else.  IMHO"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for the weekend and my friend took me here.  Walking in, the decor and layout reminded me of Corner Bakery Cafe or Panera Bread -- both of which isn't in Arizona at all.

All 3 of us ordered the Paradise Club.  She also got the Southwest Chicken salad and even though it was 105 degrees outside, he ordered the tomato soup.  His excuse - it was cold inside the restaurant.

The meat, lettuce, bacon and melted cheese was layered between a croissant cut in half and oozing of their mayo spread.  Everything was freshly prepared in front of you as you grab a tray and stand in a cafeteria-like line.   I was told that although everything is good here, they're famous for their cookies.  The best part?  It's free with your meal!

p.s.  The cookies were good.  In fact, I bought some later at the airport location to take home."}
{"text":"Came to grab a quick lunch cause Chipotle was too packed. Decided on Panera. Unfortunately this poor choice meant paying more for a smaller, less satisfying meal. A tiny \"half\" sandwhich barely bigger than the little tiny cup of soup, which costed $5.99 and $4.19 respectively. If Chipotle is full, don't come here. Just don't."}
{"text":"Not a bad Panera Bread place.  This place is \"hella packed\" as my friend put it at lunch time, even though there is a TGI Friday's right next door.  Wait, maybe it's packed BECAUSE it sits right next to a Fridays.  I don' t know.   There was also an inordinate number of women with babies there at lunch on a weekday.  Don't ask me why, but it seemed kind of weird.  Like they had all just gotten out of pilates or something.

The sandwiches are good and what you would expect from Panera Bread."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious delicious! 
Need to go back for more next week! 
Fuji salad and Thai flatbread 
Is what I got and $.99 pastry. 
What a great deal! 
Second time coming here I love ? Service is awesome and environment is great! 
Excited to come in next  time!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the desserts & the mac n cheese but it's not a huge value. We went recently & I believe have been bought out by Panera. They were out of items & everyone was scrambling although there were few customers inside; It felt rushed & that there were major changes happening behind the scenes. I use to go here all the time when I was in college for the free WiFi & calm environment but they better bring their A-game when they open as Panera especially with a kneaders & Starbucks within a short driving distance."}
{"text":"This location gets one star because it will be a great site for a future restaurant. We have a family of six with different diets. Everyone had a taste for soup and the unanimous decision was to head to Panera for dinner. We should have turned around and walked out the door when I over heard a lady say, \"I would like to speak with a manager.\" We have never been to this location and it's been a while since we've been to a Panera and now I know why. The kids wanted soup so we put our order in. The menu wasn't very clear on what came as a side for the soups in a bread bowl and the cashier didn't seem to care to tell us there were other options. She actually rolled her eyes at us when we were picking our bakery option that she up-sold us on. We found a table, filled up our drinks and waited for our order to be ready. Order up, everyone gets a bread bowl with a side of.....you guessed it, BREAD. Carb overload. The bread bowl has a huge whole in it to fill with soup, three of the four bowls we had were barely full. When you are paying almost $7 for soup you should get more than 1/3 of a cup of soup. We needed to put a to go order in for a bowl and we were curious to see what sides you can get other than more bread and we found out that chips, an apple, a multi-grain roll or yogurt are other options AND the cashier rolled her eyes at us again when we asked. After spending $48 on a disappointing dinner, I know for next time to hit the grocery store for the 5 for $10 cans of progresso. The only good thing we were walking away with was a funny memory from our 3 year old when she thought the place ran out of glass bowls."}
{"text":"Rating this place an extra star just because of their management staff. This guy who calls himself a manager, goes around his business greeting everyone, asking how their food is, asking if there is anything he can do for them...and even pitching in to take your tray and help clean out the trash bins. What an amazing boss to work for! This is how a successful business is ran ladies and gentleman. Food is good too don't get me wrong, it's a chain so what more can you expect? Love their turkey bacon bravo sandwich, grilled cheese with tomato basil soup, Thai chicken salad, and awesome cookies! Keep doing what you're doing Mr Manager! It works!"}
{"text":"Dirty, gloomy. I can not bring myself to even sit down, dirty place. Employees must be mistreated badly, or no one gives a crap, irregardless of treatment. Draining even thinking about it to write this review. Yuck."}
{"text":"GO TO WILDFLOWER ACROSSS THE STREET INSTEAD ! I went here alone and had a good lunch. I got up for a few seconds to get a 'to go' box turned around and my food and drink were getting thrown out. They took my napkin and crud and placed in my drinking glass. When I asked what they were doing she  lied..... She said,\" no one has been sitting there for a while' ....BIG lie! No line at counter and no crowd to miss me there. Obviously someone who wanted to 'look\" busy or helpful without being either.  She offered to get me another sandwich and was very mater of fact and condescending in telling me my sandwich was still fine. The cafe had plenty of seating and groups of people not eating. As a paying customer I should be able to finish a drink and pack up my sandwich without having this happen. I don't like that they touched my food. I left it behind. This was Thurs around 2:30pm.  Please Note: Wildflower is across the street. They have  very limited seating and this doesn't happen there so I am going to Wildflower. Also, she was the manager. She had 4 people idle who I assume she thought weren't doing anything and she just had to show them....well, one of those folks was paying attention and walked over at the same time to stop her. Bad that she lied to me in front of  her employee. If she really was the manager she needs a few drippings in the training pond."}
{"text":"Close to the house, clean and good service. I love the tomato bisque soup with sour dough bread and chocolate cookie!"}
{"text":"Always great service. Their bakery is so surprisingly good not just for a chain but even compared to favorite local bakeries. 

I have a perception that 'fast food' places that try to be healthy like Panera have mediocre food but I find that their salads are much more satisfying than a salad I'd pay for at a restaurant. The dressings and non-lettuce ingredients are great. 

Panera coffee is also much better than Starbucks, which is very bitter. I go to starbucks when I want a fun coffee drink. 

I like how they've added sugar count for all their drinks and ingredients in everything. They're very transparent which is appreciated for nutrition nerds like myself.

I often use the online rapid pick up option from Panera."}
{"text":"This Panera just opened and is in a prime location in Boca Park.  I'm no stranger to Panera, having made many visits during my time as a grad student back east.  The \"you pick 2\" deal is always satisfying (pick any combo of a half sandwich, soup, or salad) and for an extra $0.99, you can add on a cookie.  The baked goods are on the dry side, which is a little disappointing, and the tea selection can use a few more herbal options.  Service was friendly, if a bit slow (staff was mainly comprised of what looked like high school students??), but overall, Panera is a cheaper -- and slightly more nutritious -- alternative to Cheesecake Factory, Gordon Biersch, Kona, etc."}
{"text":"1. Place was a mess when I came in. Was as if a hurricane came inside.

2.damn near chipped my tooth on the burnt hard bread they served me.

3.asked for a 2go box and 15 minutes still no box. Just left without it..."}
{"text":"Being from Hawaii I've heard others rave about this chain.  This was certainly nothig to write home about.  Hubby and I both had the half sandwich and cup soup combo; he had broccoli cream soup and some type of chicken sandwich with red onions and tomatoes. I had the chicken avocado sandwich and the French onion soup. Both were extremely blah, and mostly made up of bread with not very much meat, or vegetables. Our soups were luke warm, and not hot. My French onion soup broth was very thick, almost like a bisque, rather than a broth. I barely ate my food, because I'd rather save my calories for something tastier. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Extremely Disappointed! Worst place I have ever went to! The food was terrible! I don't like their food! They overcome of their food and Beware!"}
{"text":"Went to this location with my Mom. We both ordered salads (whole, not half). Hers came out first - it was huge and beautiful...was told mine was on it's way. Mine took at least 10 more minutes to arrive (chicken cobb with avocado), not only was mine the size of a half order, it had only ONE tiny chunk of avocado! When i asked about it, i was told that's the way it is! After telling the person behind the counter that i had only ONE tiny piece of avocado, she, grudgingly, gave me more (not only was she mean about it, she had to ask someone else for it 3 times!!). Needless to say, we will NEVER return to this location again, nor will we visit the one on Eastern, near Silverado Ranch (did not review this one but it was even worse, which is why we drove all the way to the Mall location...). Take your chances."}
{"text":"This place was horrible...the service was rude and the girl who placed my order kept checking her phone and was distracted by her manager which inevitably messed up our order...when we received our food the Italian sandwich had stale bread and the meat was a weird color...we also ordered the cashew salad which cane as soggy as can be and burnt steak panini....overall never again!!!! Horrific place ti eat"}
{"text":"Food was real good, atmosphere sounded like open-mic night at every lame bar you've ever been to. 

Fun Fact: This is where the hipster dipshits from Starbucks go to die."}
{"text":"I love Panera and this one always has good food, but they really need to figure out where/how they want people to line up. They have people lining up at the bakery side and then the regular side and it's a giant cluster EVERY TIME. And when you ask an employee they say they just take people from both sides. No. That's just making it worse. I get you can only do so much with the stupidity plaguing our population, but it shouldn't be such a cluster all the time."}
{"text":"I discovered the secret menu at Panera Bread.  I make this place a weekly lunch spot.   I have only ordered the steak lettuce wraps from that menu.  Awesome Lunch!!!  I am looking forward to trying the other items from the secret menu, especially the breakfast."}
{"text":"I don't care if you are a franchisee, if the website that is your presence and source of marketing on the web, as well as being the site through which I found you (http://www.panerabread.com/) says that you have wireless internet access, you had damn well better have some wireless internet access!

I did not even stay to try the food (which I am sure is approximately the same as other Panera Bread Cos. around town), so cannot comment on that."}
{"text":"You know what you are getting when you walk through the door.  The menu does change slightly but everyone has their favorites.  

WHat does add to this location is that the staff is usually friendly and in a good mood.  At other locations, you get a fast-food experience from a fast-food staff."}
{"text":"They changed the Cobb salad to something that is completely inedible. When asked to change it, it was missing several ingredients. Left hungry."}
{"text":"Will be back because of the customer service! I came to this location tonight to get some yummy food and finish up some studying! The sandwich tasted great, wasn't really put together that well, but still tasted good! The male server was fantastic! He was very attentive and made sure I was enjoying my meal, there was also another female server who was so sweet and funny! At one point the sun was shining on me and she asked if I was melting and if she could find another spot for me. I actually like sitting in the sun so we joked about it. All in all a great experience! I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"It wouldn't be worth rating another corporate BS place, but, I have to say this location here IS nice to hold meetings at, as it's very large and accomodates many people, who may like to order themselves coffee or sandwiches.  It's right in Oakland, and has a free parking lot in walking distance to a lot of other things that you might want to check out on your way out.

As far as the chain itself goes, the bottom line is that Panera is WAY too damn expensive for what you get.  Nothing there is particularly bad, but it's not particularly good either, and certainly not creative. $7 for half of a grilled cheese and a cup of tomato soup?!  Really? No thanks.  Better than star bucks, OK, but kinda on the same lines.  It's Starbucks+.  I wonder if they're owned by the same holding company or something.

So, fine for group meetings, but don't go there by yourself or with the significant other."}
{"text":"Decided to avoid the usual fast food or great big breakfast and found myself at Panera. Got a bagel with egg, avocado spinach bagel. It was delicious, light and fresh and for under $5. They also have a selecting of unsweetened juices that are yummy. Staff was friendly and helpful. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch with my girls here a while back. It is a cute little place. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The food came out quickly. I was trying to be food cautious that day was thought they had a little brochure of the nutritional facts for their food. No... they had a HHUGE BINDER for the information and brought it to our table for me. How nice of them. And the bread was delicious! I had the half soup half salad with the specialty salad and it was a good size salad for only being \"half\". Too bad all the Panera Bread Cafes are so far from me over in the NW... bummer."}
{"text":"As a lover of Panera bread, I was excited to see that they opened up a location near my home. I am thoroughly disappointed with the service and the meal. I ordered a Fuji APPLE chicken salad, and they completely forgot the apples or by the looks of it they just gave me the crumbs at the bottom on the bag. Terrible service, terrible food! Will drive the extra miles to go to a different location!"}
{"text":"My salad looked like someone made it and didn't want it,placed it in a fridge for two hours and then served it to me.  It was so bad I probably won't go back to this location."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Panera's. I went there for lunch. I'm not familiar with the menu so I was lost. The cashier was very patient with me while I took my time to order. I ordered a full sandwich w/ French bread-like bread on the side, a cup of soup w/ apple on the side and a regular drink. The side came with each item I ordered.  I thought it was like a fast food type of environment but they handed me a number so I sat down. The cashier recommended that I get a REWARDS card with Panera so I can start receiving deals. I didn't hesitate because I enjoy collecting reward cards from different stores I go to. The server brought my food to the table. I started off by dipping my bread into my cup of soup. The bread was very fresh and soft that it practically melted in my mouth. It was that GOOOOD! I was full by the time I was done with half my sandwich, cup of soup and the bread on the side. Next time I'll know to order a half a sandwich, soup and bread on the side. NOW while I was waiting for my food to be served, I went on my phone and registered my rewards card. At the end, it indicated that I can claim my FREE cookies or pastry. I waited until I was done eating before I went back to the cash register. When I showed my card, the cashier swiped it and she said that I can pick anything from the cookie/pastry area. I chose a Cinnamon Roll. This Cinnamon Roll was huge. It was like approx. 5-6 inches. If I were to just buy the Cinnamon Roll by itself, it would cost over $3.00 each. Man, don't get me started on the Cinnamon Roll!!! My goodness!!!!! I think I just found myself a new sandwich shop to go to thanks to my boyfriend who introduced me to this place. 

Too bad they don't make SQUAW BREAD. I love that bread. I used to get it back home in Cali at the Old World Deli. It must be a West Coast thang.. Lol. Not too many people are familar with the Squaw Bread. 

OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Excellent!
PROs: excellent service, quiet, plenty of parking, free WiFi, each booth has an outlet for your phone charger, laptop charger, etc., outside seating area
CONs: not enough seating area, not really kid friendly, somewhat on the pricey side (but it's worth it!)"}
{"text":"I had a problem with a sandwich and told the manager who did nothing. \"Accuracy matters so tell the manager\"  It's on the receipt."}
{"text":"Dropped in this morning for my bagel. The new staff is really new and young. They are pleasant, but I miss Cheryl, who knew my name and my order."}
{"text":"This is a great Panera location. 

For the past 16 months we have gone weekly for lunch. We stay for hours visiting - with a baby - and they are more than happy to have us. 

The food is consistent. The restaurant is clean. Prices are affordable. 

We look forward to our Panera lunches."}
{"text":"Panera is my go to spot when i dont fee like cooking ! i love this place so much, the pick 2 menu option is the best. soup and salad for $7.99 cant beat it. The menu selection is amazing, endless combination choices, the soup choices are scrumptious my only gripe is this specific location always seems to be out of chicken and wild rice soup. Bummer.I usually get the half Caesar salad with a bacon turkey bravo or if i want soup i usually go the french onion route with the soup in a bread bowl.Its neat and clean inside, this location has a drive thru if youre in a rush. Also, be sure to join panera rewards because you can earn free food and drinks for every time you visit."}
{"text":"I usually go here for lunch about once a week and they never disappoint. The food is great. The employees are polite  and friendly. The only thing I'm not a fan if is the new flavored teas but thats not their fault, its a preference thing. Even when you go during the lunch hour and there's a long line they seem to get through the line quickly and accurately! Great place for a quick bite!!"}
{"text":"So this Panera bread is surrounded by other restaurants and shops. And if you have eaten out of narrow bread before it is just like every other player bread there is :-). The service was good prices were the same as anywhere else. There was ample indoor and outdoor seating.
 All in all it was a good experience. The service was rather slow and there was not enough individuals ordering or eating there to warrant slow service. But the service was done with a smile and that is always appreciated."}
{"text":"You have to try the autumn squash soup!!!

Now....I hate squash! But for some reason I wanted to try this & I am glad I did!

It's excellent!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service by London. Good food, good family environment.
We had our family dinner and all enjoyed the food and time there."}
{"text":"This place is expensive but not bad taste wise. $23 for 1/2 bowl Mac and cheese, a 1/2 napa almond chicken sandwich, a baguette, a toffee nut cookie with a capacinno and hot chocolate! I'm still hungry :( the thing that turned me off was my hot chocolate wasn't hot, it was only like warm :("}
{"text":"Panera is usually a 3 star, but the service here is very poor.   Expect longer than usual wait times here.  This location seems mismanaged and a tad unclean."}
{"text":"I keep forgetting this Panera is open and thus haven't been here until now. The location is convenient because it's only a few minutes from my work and I can place an order through my Panera app and it'll be ready when I arrive. This location must get busy because they have self service ordering tablets in addition to the Mobile ordering feature.

The food is standard Panera fare and my favorite entree is usually the Green Goddess Salad. I love that Panera allows you to sub the default side (bread) for whatever else you'd like (apple, chips, etc). Of course I always pick the apple. Drinks are self service, including tea and coffee, which I love because that means unlimited refills on my coffee!

Panera is pretty pricey IMO for the portion sizes you get, but I love it because it's convenient when ordering through the app because the food is waiting for me when I show up. Also, their food tastes super fresh which is always a plus nowadays!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Panera for years.  It started when I lived in St. Louis (they are called St Louis Bread Co there, except for their PaneraCares location).  It was a favorite place to get a reasonably priced lunch that was also reasonably healthy.  And in the winter I really liked getting a grilled cheese and some soup.

That still carries over to here in the Phoenix area.  This new location is very close to where I live and I think I've tried every way of ordering they have.  At the counter, the drive-thru, the kiosks, on the app, and on my computer from home, and it all worked really well.  Initially I had some hiccups with my rewards membership, but their online customer service was top notch and got that back in order.   Now I earn rewards fairly regularly.

The employees at this location have always been friendly and helpful and when the guy working the drive thru one morning suggested an over easy egg for the steak & egg bagel sandwich...well...that was a revelation.  Messy for sure, but damn delicious to have that yolky goodness all over the bagel.  

I've also tried the steak and arugula sandwich which looks simple, but is outstanding, some of their other breakfast sandwiches, and cookies.  All have been delicious.  And since forever I've been addicted to the cinnamon crunch bagel with honey walnut cream cheese.  Even if I'm trying to eat low carb, I'll sneak one of those in.  Fantastic.  Overall, one of my favorite places.  No complaints."}
{"text":"My experience at Panera was quite disappointing. I got a chicken cobb salad with avocado and a steak and arugula sandwich. The salad did not look appetizing at all when I got it. It looked like they just threw a bunch of stuff together and didn't even bother to shake it. The half of an avocado in the salad wasn't even cut! The sandwich at first looked pretty good, but when I picked it up, I realized the bread at the bottom was very moist. And moist bread is disgusting! The best part of the meal was the mango smoothie. But come on, it'd be pretty sad if they managed to mess up a mango smoothie. All this costed me $20, which was definitely not worth it. I will pick Aroma over this place any day."}
{"text":"The radio ads over-hype this cafeteria like place. The food was \"okay\" but definitely not what I was looking for.
They have no clue what a souffle is, or else they would not be pawning off a heavy cream cheese filled danish as a cheese Souffle.
The so-called fruit cup was a tiny plastic cup with some bits of canned and a few bits of fresh fruit. I could have got that at a hospital.
There were none of enticing smells of fresh baked bread which the ad drooled over. In fact, I doubt there was any real fresh baked bread in the place.
They did have good coffee and that is why 2 stars.
I do not plan to return."}
{"text":"Joined the MyPanera membership online and came into store today to get the card. The employees were very nice about it and helped me in no time.
Because I had just registered for the first time, I got to have a pastry on the house and I chose the cinnamon roll. It was gigantic!! Equaling about the size of my face, it was soft, not too sweet, and had a hint of orange zest flavor. 
Pretty good, but I would've preferred it to have a little more crunch perhaps on the edges. The softness made me feel like I was eating a lot of starch and I got sick of it after only eating half.
I would however be interested in trying out their other pastries too."}
{"text":"For those who know Panera - you know what you're in for here.  Free WiFi, high quality food, nice atmosphere.  For West Akron, great location."}
{"text":"Place is a gold mine and management seems incapable of knowing how to mine the gold. 
Very inconsistent when under pressure of dinner crunch. Often run out of popular items after entree is paid for and one is compelled to substitute another item. Would almost certainly point to lack of planning, or plain not caring!  Happens far too often to be a well managed business. 
Out of frustration with inconsistent service was encouraged by results of a couple of Internet orders only to have that fail miserably last night and have the manager deflect blame stopping just short of blaming me for their own problem. Like I said gold mine with no miners, and nobody that can deal with pressure and adversity. Sadly Panera's food is tasty and reasonably healthy if you turn a blind eye to ridiculous sodium content. My advise, eat at home!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch here with my coworker and I ordered the Italian Combo and a small soft drink for $9.29 total. The sandwich was made right away. We were waiting for one of our other coworkers to fly in so we decided to eat lunch while we waited. I was filling up my drink when my pager started to ring to pick up my food. The Italian Combo was okay to me and nothing special. My coworker ordered the pick any 2 with soup and salad. The Panera Bread was pretty busy around the time we came which was around noon. This was pretty close to the airport as well."}
{"text":"Each time I've been to this Panera, they're always out of something, the employees are rude, and the place seems dirty. Today, my wife grabbed us a couple 1/2 salads to go. We were both shocked just how small the portions were when she got home. The \"1/2 to go\" is like half the size of the half portion when eating in the restaurant. It's like I got a child's portion. I really miss when this chain used to be Paradise Bakery; they had their act together. Here's a photo of my really small salad...not much bigger than the small baguette roll..."}
{"text":"Ordered online for my boss. Being unfamiliar with their ordering procedures, I was annoyed to find that I couldn't order without giving my c.c info. When food came. I sent it to my boss who didn't realize I had to pay. Her assistant took it upon herself to add a five dollar tip. So in the long run, I had debited from my account 17.72 for a cup of soup and 1/2 a panini sandwich. Being an ex- artisanal bread baker, I find them way over priced for value."}
{"text":"Not even sure why people are so obsessed with this place. Each time I have given it a chance something was wrong. First time I received the wrong order and they added stuff onto my sandwich I specifically asked not to include. The last time I was there I was given a burnt bagel and actually asked if it was acceptable or if they should make another one. I mean really..  Pastries were no good and even stale. Prices are ridiculous too, $4 for a chai tea is insane."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this location.  The trays and silverware were dirty.  The cashier didn't listen.  The food didn't seem fresh and the cookie that is normally to die for was over baked. The flavored ice teas were all empty and the table area just looked dirty."}
{"text":"Found the most amazing Cinnamon CRUNCH bagel in the world, but everyone in the world must have taken them this morning. 
Its awkward enough to admit I would willingly take on the hike to drive mallard creek green way detour for a bagel, but considering the long day ahead I figured it would be a nice reward. 

\"We are out\" keeps screeching through my head.
I love that they offer Free WiFi, but how is that helpful if I am coming here to eat.
Unfortunately it's the same old song evertime and my advice would be to avoid this location if you are craving one of their delicious treats. Prepare yourself to hear \"we are out\" no matter what you order (Soup, bagel, cookie ).

THE OTHER GOOD: friendly staff and always clean establishment considering they have no food

BTW they have you make your own coffee with no special flavors- very disappointed"}
{"text":"So sad Paradise Bakery was replaced by Panera.  Really miss good salads, sandwiches and the tea.  Can't say Panera has much that we like.  Einstein has better bagels and cream cheeses as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the drive through at Panera on Mayfield Rd., Mayfield Hts. on Friday, 4-15-16, about 7:45 pm. He ordered a sandwich for himself and a salad for me.  When we got home and I opened the bag, there was a piece of bread that had obviously been torn (on both ends) from a loaf of French bread.  The bread on both sides was hard. First and last time for me."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place.
Good sandwiches, salads, soups.
And the green tea is to die for."}
{"text":"Well, I have been going to Panera for years, but this is the first time I am writing a review. I thought the food was good, possibly deserving 4 stars, but it's not just about the food. I found the service poor. The cashier, Karlye was so poor and rude that I had to write a review a first time. She took what seem like forever, to help us after having an extended conversation with the previous customer. After taking our order, she was very blunt when asked a question. We asked for one of each type of cookie. \"What kind do you want?\" she said with an attitude. We had to repeat the statement, but felt as if WE upset her. Then lastly, she snatched the money out of my had and gave my the change, by allowing it to fall on the counter. I'll never go back. Please train your staff better,  Panera. I will find another place to take my business."}
{"text":"This Panera Bread has its good points and its bad points.  If you are a big fan of decaf iced coffee, this location almost always has it available.  I have yet to find another location of this chain that even has it at all.  The dining room is huge, as is the case with most Panera's.  Easy to get my crazy big stroller in and out.  

Unfortunately, the food can be a little inconsistent.  I usually get the sausage, egg & cheese panini.  Here, sometimes it rocks my world and other times it is not so good.  Not sure what is going on there.  Also, once I bought a coffee and the cashier forgot to give me the cup, as it is serve yourself.  When I went back to get the cup, he actually questioned whether I bought coffee, in a very accusatory manner, and asked to see my receipt.  Never in my life has that happened.  It was kind of awkward.

They have a cute loyalty program where customers scan their cards and can get random rewards.  It's unpredictable but I find it kind of fun.  Free wifi, too!"}
{"text":"I had a great customer service experience at this location today! All the workers were really friendly and my lunch was made perfectly!"}
{"text":"Don't go here unless you like to spend money for lousy portions and weak service. There are like a hundred employees and when o went no line. It still took forever to get my food as each little station needed to do my food. We got Mac and cheese and it was in a small cup half full. Had about ten shells in it. It was as cold too. Sad. 
My salad took ten minutes because she had to methodically weigh each item going in my salad because they wouldn't want to lose any money on those extra olives. Next came the smoothies. They didn't fill them up all the way and said \" they aren't totally full - would you like some ice in them?\"  She was brilliant. They were sweeping like mad people behind the counter and it was kinda gross thinking of the stuff coming up landing on the exposed food items. Panera is a good concept but they will be gone soon with the dumb way they do things."}
{"text":"Good eats at this place, that I can say for sure. I've never been disappointed, and I'm pretty picky. The banana nut waffles are my fave. Wish there was a nice outdoor patio though, it does get crowded inside once the booths are all taken. But all in all, the servers/cooks are pretty accommodating. *Free wi-fi as well ;0)"}
{"text":"Although I do enjoy Panera bread, the drive thru is terrible and very slow!!!! I work right down the street and could have been late if I didn't give myself 30 minutes to spare. DO NOT GO TO THE DRIVE THRU!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but way to expensive for what you get ad how good it is.  I have never had a bad experience with their staff.  I have had a mistake or two but managers made it right.   Just for the bang for the buck you are better going to Kneaders a little farther down the road... And their desserts destroy Paradise Bakery's. I have had a problem with Paradise running out of food making materials like veggies or bread.  Kneaders, as busy as they are, keep stocked much better."}
{"text":"Panera, thank you so much for the amazing dinner I just had with my bestfriend. I'm exaggerating a little bit but still. Customer service was outstanding. The manager told me Karina was the one that took my order. She was friendly and patient, she gave me a water cup without me even asking. I know people would say \"well she was just nice and gave you a water cup\" but the thing is she didn't have to do that. It was the end of the day but they were still very gracious about us being there. Shawn or Sean brought my food over and the guy literally had to walk back and forth 3 times to get me the things I needed and he gave me an apple. I just had a really pleasant visit after a long day from work and I really appreciated the customer care that they provided. 
A little nice gesture goes a long way. Thank you. 
Oh and the food was awesome, I got half of a steak and arugula sandwich and half of a kale Caesar salad which were so tasty. 
Definitely recommend this place, definitely worth every penny. 
Thanks again!"}
{"text":"I eat lunch at this location at least 3 times a week and the staff is always trying hard to please everyone and they are running around frantically. The biggest issues with this location are NOT the employees, it is the customers and SQUATTERS!!! Why do people think it is acceptable to hold sales meetings there and don't buy anything? They take up about half the tables at lunch and about 2/3 of the parking lot. then there are the PIGS! Those that feel they can eat and make a mess then get up and leave their dishes. Your mother doesn't work there so clean up after yourself!!! People in the Ballantyne area in general are arrogant, rude and obnoxious but they are at their worst at Panera!!! Employees get a +++ while customers get a HUGE thumbs down!!!"}
{"text":"Just went in for some bread and a pecan roll to go the guy helping me seemed pre occupied and couldn't seem to get my order right... my Panera in the bay is waaay friendlier & personable"}
{"text":"The customer service of this location is fantastic.  We ordered our food and the manager delivered our food to us and looked at our bill.  He said we were overcharged for an item without us even knowing.  Any manager or establishment that takes care of there customer base as this one did should consistently get five stars.  The food was perfect, the timeliness was great and again, the customer service was impeccable.  We went for dinner and also breakfast the next morning.  I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"I was happy to see a Panera open in my neighborhood because I've been carrying around a My Panera card that I can only use when I go back to St. Louis.  When I did live there Panera was my goto in the winter mainly for some quick, inexpensive comfort food, like a grilled cheese and a nice bowl of soup.  

Due to the hot temps here in AZ, I've looked for lighter options.  I've used the drive-thru only at this Panera 4 times and overall have had good experiences.  I've gotten bagels and iced green tea twice and also tried their Mediterranean veggie sandwich and the Roasted Turkey and Avocado BLT.  All have been very fresh and tasty and only one time they forgot the napkins, but I was headed home so it was no big deal.  

I feel for them and all the negative reviews.  This is a tough to please neighborhood with an inordinate number of people speeding around in their luxury SUVs acting like they are the only ones on the road, and the only ones in the restaurant.  If you don't cater to them you are in big trouble.  Hopefully this location can get their issues straightened out.  I know from the St. Louis perspective, Panera is a great corporate citizen which does a lot in the community and gives back to many charities that fight hunger.  I don't know if they are doing that here in AZ, but the next time I'm in I'm going to ask."}
{"text":"Panera's food quality keeps going down. Today for lunch I ordered the lentil quinoa bowl to go, and it was filled only half way. This is the amount of soup you would normally get in a soup cup at a sit-down restaurant, but is a ridiculous $8. You're paying $8 for a cup's worth of broth.

They threw in a lemon slice and called that flavor.

Panera needs to stop charging sit-down restaurant lunch prices for the scraps of bland food they give you."}
{"text":"I stopped in at the Biltmore store Panera (fka Paradise Bakery) three times now over the last 2 months and more than half of their menu board is covered by paper.  There were only four or five sandwich options.  Over the last 2 months I have been waiting for the menu to change, but none of the staff know when that will happen.  Time to write Panera off my list for restaurants."}
{"text":"4-5-14 - Three times I visited the Phoenix Panera  on Central and Thomas.  They have a mouthwatering picture of their breakfast sandwich: egg, bacon and cheese.  The first time I was 2 minutes late to order the sandwich, of course I waited in line for 15 minutes before having the opportunity to order.  The second time I waited for more than 10 minutes just to order their green tea, which turned out to be horrible.  The third time my husband and I made a morning trip so that I could order the breakfast sandwich.  What a waste of time and money.  The real sandwich does not look at all like the picture and we were extremely disappointed in the quality.  Also, the staff was under-trained because she did not know how to ring up my husband's order.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Open for business!

THE UP-SIDE:  This location is brand-spankin' new, just a stone's throw from Route 2, and always hopping.  While some might bemoan the whole \"corporate\" coffee chain thing - myself included at times - I really don't mind Panera.  The food is definitely a step above average fast food, and the drinks are quite good.  In addition, the place has a very warm, open, and welcoming vibe - something I require to sit down and write.  

THE DOWN-SIDE:  Outlets, or lack thereof.  Look, I know the management of Panera doesn't want people camping here all day, but if you're gonna promote yourself as a place to hang out and drink coffee, then you'd better walk the walk.  On any given day, there are tons of people who visit here with laptops.  Panera knows this, and yet, outlets are scarce.  Makes no sense and does nothing but frustrate the customers.  That said, there are a few to be found if you try real hard.

THE SUM-IT-UP:  Not my favorite restaurant on the planet, but a solid choice for fast, good food and a nice place to write.  

...but please, save me an outlet!"}
{"text":"This is only the 3rd time I have been to any Panera. Every time I have been, I have liked it , a lot! 
This place is another good one. It is very clean. The staff was nice.
The food is really good. 
We got salads,they were very fresh, filling and very tasty!
They have a website you can go to and sign up for deals and coupons and such. Although I have not done that yet, I will one day. Or my girlfriend will. She is better at following up on things than I am.

I liked the Ice Tea here. I like the fact it has no sugar already added.
Their chicken states it is Non antibiotic, you have to love that.
I think it is a good place to go when you are out and about and need a healthy and tasty meal.
Yes, it is a little high, But, not too bad for the good food you get."}
{"text":"Thai Chicken Flatbread, chicken soba noodle salad and chicken noodle soup...served with French bread bagette...very good and nice lunch portions. Lotsa selections too of soups and sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Literally had a cook scream at me today because I asked if my rapid pickup order that I placed 45 minutes prior was ready. Management had no control of their staff as they were just standing around in the kitchen in a group talking."}
{"text":"I love this Panera Bread. The employees are very friendly and helpful if you need a suggestion. I love all their soups. I usually get half soup half sandwich. The turkey chili is really good. I usually get one of their turkey sandwiches. The does get crowded sometimes and parking can be difficult. But, overall I think everything including the seating areas are just fine."}
{"text":"The online delivery service at Panera's  Waverly location is great ! The website is easy to navigate and they have all the options you need for ordering online along with special instructions if needed for your 
delivery .
The website generates options for text available for tracking your order and the name of the driver is provided as well. 
The update is sent to you when the order arrives. 
Remarkable service with delicious food at affordable prices .... Panera has it down !
My lunch today was the Pick Two (Soup & Flatbread) . The tomato soup was hot and delicious along with small bag of croutons to add ! The mozzarella tomato basil flatbread sandwich was hot and yummy!"}
{"text":"The service is always slow here.  No matter if it is during peak hours or completely dead.  The food is not to Panera's standard and is constantly Luke warm.  Thankfully they have a microwave for me to warm up soup that should be hot!"}
{"text":"Ok I'm giving them a three star because this time I used the drive thru, I got the Santa fe salad, I was really disappointed. First off, I hardly got any any dressing in my salad which is a real bummer and the chicken was under cooked I had to pick out all the chicken (which there was not very much) I was really excited about getting this as this is my favorite thing to order, but was disappointed I will come back but will have to go inside from now on."}
{"text":"This location really needs to step it up.  I have always liked Paradise Bakery...and Panera in other states, but this location is bad.  They continually get orders wrong.  Charge you for a large salad, but bring you a small,  Charge for a dessert, but fail to bring it to you and there is only one person working the bakery and the line is too long to wait.  Their computers are down and you can't get credit on your card.
Last time I was there, all the tables were dirty and when asked why,  I heard, \"Oh, everyone left at the same time and we haven't had time to clear them,\""}
{"text":"One of my favorite Panera locations. The food is consistent at most Panera's but what sets this apart is the service. From Ashley, the manager, to the behind the counter staff, and even the women who come around to bus your table when you're done, this spot has it all!!"}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place doesn't rate better?  

The food in this part of town is average chain food stuck in the middle of the shopping area of suburbia.  

Why do I like this place?  It stands out just a little due to fresher ingredients and items I know they are not always opening from a can.  The baked goods were solid.  The egg sandwich is a real egg, not precooked and reheated.  Or scrambled and microwaved.  

What did I learn today?  I want an orange cranberry muffin."}
{"text":"Very nice and quiet environment to eat healthy and study. Good customer service. I like their table tracker. Just have a seat and wait at your table and your food will be in front of you!"}
{"text":"I have placed several rapid pick up orders from this place and they have NEVER been ready when I actually go pick them up. Sometimes I order 30 minutes in advance, and my order is still not ready. Then the staff looks at me like I have 4 heads when I tell them I have an online order???"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch on my way to an appointment.
Salad and sandwich combo and an iced tea.

Everything I had was fresh and tasty. The place is clean with plenty of seating.
I didn't find the prices to be notably different than Paradise.

I also got cookies on the way out to bring to the appointment, and they were a hit.

This place isn't reinventing the wheel. I wouldn't think to come here when I wanted a great meal.

But - for a quick service lunch? Beats the crap out of fast food on so many levels, and I'm sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a morning meeting and is was a-ok! It was pretty busy at 10 AM on a Thursday! There were definitely a lot of people working away, probably due to their complimentary wifi! That is a major perk. :) 

I ordered a small coffee and a side of fruit {trying to be healthy in the new year!}. The side of fruit was decent, but your typical pre-packaged fruit. The hazelnut coffee was quite tasty! I would just ask that they put skim milk out or even better, almond milk! They only had half & half at the coffee station. Their stations were a little confusing and they don't have silverware out so I felt myself walking around the center island multiple times but eventually found everything that I needed. 

All in all, if you're looking to meet someone in a central place, Panera works! Food wise, it is your typical fast chain breakfast/sandwich/salad/soup place!"}
{"text":"Great service !  I tried the pesto sachettini for the first time and it was delicious! Dipped my baguette with the pesto sauce left on my plate! The Iced chai tea is great as always ,actually taste better than I remembered !"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! They have a black cherry smoothie off and on that is THE best! I just wish they had it all the time!"}
{"text":"The chai tea latte was filled 3/4 of the way.. Somewhat comforting reading the same issue on another peer review.. Also got the turkey avocado blt, half size w soup, and it was bunched up the size of a fist in my to go bag. All this after $14... ahh, Robbery! My advice for this place is, put a little more passion in making Your food look presentable than slapping some meat and bread together and serving the chais in larger cups than it can handle. Perhaps giving more perks on the panera card than just 1 reward every blue moon. Until than, I'll just stick w their bagels and coffee when every other restaurant in town is shut down."}
{"text":"I went in this Panera and was very nice to the manager Duane but he was very very rude to me I had a few questions and he rolled his eyes and made a face to the girl he asked to help me instead.. clearly he's a dumb idiot who didn't know the answer to anything about the panera rewards he gave me a bogus answer just to get me out the way and made a face which I don't understand why !!!!! Can't take a couple questions then maybe you shouldn't be the manager!!! I kept it classy since there were people in there of course he was sooooooo mad haha he showed his expression all over his face!!  .. that guy represents trash I see why he probably makes less than 20 an hr .. COMPLETE GARBAGE!!!! For that reason I'm done with buying Panera I came to that location twice yesterday and I'm Sooooo happy I don't have to deal with an idiot like that in my everyday life!!! ^_^ will not be attending this panera again I wanted to throw a banana at the guy!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what to make of the previous review as this Panera looks exactly like every other.  However, what sets this one apart is the poor service.  The 'kids' working here are not trained sufficiently and spend more time socializing with co-workers and same-age customers than they spend serving the other customers, cleaning  or stocking.

Most recently we ordered a dozen bagels sliced, and we received 11 with just barely the tops cut.  The young man waiting on us apparently didn't  know how to use the slicer, and instead of asking someone for assistance, he sent us home with these bagels that are a mess and don't fit in the toaster, because we have one extra fat half, and the other wafer thin with just the topping.

This isn't the first time we've experienced issues like this at this Panera.  It seems the whole staff could use additional training.  Also, this store is generally not cleaned as well as others we've visited."}
{"text":"Best time to come: 930am-11am to avoid the breakfast and lunch crowd. Nice patio, but looks out to Walmart. Very well staffed during their Grand Opening"}
{"text":"The food is great but customer service and the rewards program aren't the best.  If you order from the Kiosk you can  get a fee medium coffee.  I was not give the opportunity to do that. I have yet to get any thing from the rewards program. I spend about 20.00 a month.  They seem very disorganized with items bring ready."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting Panera Bread locations around Vegas for YEARS. In my opinion, this location stands out as the cleanest and most consistently delicious with the most friendly staff! The staff are always smiling and eager to take your order, speaking to you like you're an old friend! 

I stopped in here this morning to grab a quick bagel and coffee before work. I rarely eat bagels, but have been craving one for weeks. I ordered Asiago Cheese, toasted, with cream cheese and a large coffee. Coffee is self serve (unless you order a latte) and I really enjoy their Hazelnut brew! I also ordered a pumpkin spice latte for my girlfriend. 

Bagels were ready in just a few minutes and always taste fresh and delicious. My only complaint is that the cream cheese comes in a small container and you have to put it on your bagel yourself. This is a bit inconvenient for me as I prefer the grab and go style quickie breakfast. 

When I drop in for a quick lunch/dinner, I always go for the \"you pick two\" option because I can never decide between soup or sandwich/panini. I don't think I've ever not enjoyed a sandwich from here. Everything is always made fresh with quality ingredients (meats, cheese, veggies). Also, you CANNOT go wrong w/ the broccoli cheese soup - yummy!!!!

ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS order a side of french baguette. Trust me, it tastes like heaven!"}
{"text":"This store is constantly out of items in the middle of the day. Not sure if someone is terrible at ordering restock or trying too hard to reduce reduce waste. Either way it's irritating to have to wonder what the store will be out of when I'm deciding if I want to eat there."}
{"text":"I got the You Pick Two deal with the Mediterranean Veggie sandwich and the vegetable pesto soup. The concept of You Pick Two is nice in the sense that you can try two things.

The taste of both of these dishes were pretty good but they were not filling enough to be a decent lunch! :( I was still hungry afterwards (I picked chips as my side.)"}
{"text":"I ordered a turkey avocado sandwich and after a really long wait 40 minutes it finally came out with no avacado on it.i sent it back and waited another 15 minutes till they could fix it. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"This Panera is along the Ohio Turnpike,between Toledo and Cleveland.  I like their coffee better than Starbucks, and Burger King isn't an option.  Its a good size, with plenty of seating, although we were making a pit stop, grabbing coffee and going.  

Its a normal Panera with most of the regular offerings - bagels, cookies and sandwiches.  A little price premium - but it is along the turnpike so nothing is that inexpensive.  

This rest stop was nice and big and clean."}
{"text":"A bigger place, lots of traffic, good location if you are driving near the PA turnpike.  
Good staff attentiveness on the coffee area - almost a person cleaning and refilling the entire time we were there (8:30am to 9am)  There was enough empty tables to find a place without feeling cramp.

No real issues."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service, food, iced chai tea latte, and cinnamon roll. My 9 year old son compared the cinnamon roll to the one at school. Come on panera. Clark county school district cinnamon rolls taste the same as yours? Time to change. 
Also on my steak and white cheddar sandwich the steak was undercooked, and cold in the center. I sent it back and it was as if they put the whole sandwich in the toaster twice. This time the bread was super hard and the steak was tasteless. The manager said \"what do you want me to do, replace it\"? In a question.  Utterly dissatisfied.  I will never be back."}
{"text":"The food is good - typical of any Paradise Bakery. Good breads, meats, salads and the cookies.
  The facility is great, but parking is horrible.
  The reason for the low score is the staff. It seemed like they were all moving under water. The sandwich guy may have been the slowest person I've ever seen. Lethargic would be a good description."}
{"text":"This paneer location has the worst parking ever. I constantly see people from other restaurants parking here and it just annoys me. 

On the non bitching side, the employees here are always friendly, patient (since I can never decide in a timely manner), and efficient. My large orders are done in less than ten.

Mind you the soups an sandwiches are mind blowing delicious. Always the perfect app for lunch or fall weather. Love that they give you a small side choice of bread, kettle chips or apple. Such decisions!

Panera you shall be seeing me more!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place for lunch or dinner, I've never had a bad experience at any of their locations. Solid food at a decent price.  The panninis  are my favorites along with the crumbly bleu salad. The chocolate chip cookies come with the meal and are incredible. Four types of brewed ice teas always gets me excited (I'm easily amused, sorry)."}
{"text":"Panera Bread is a great place to grab a quick lunch when you want to sit down somewhere but don't want to spend too much time at one place.  I was out on my lunch break and needed to get away from the office, but knew that I had to stick to my strict 1 hour break so I decided to grab one of their Pick 2 combos. 
I ended up choosing a simple Greek Salad and their Chicken Walnut sandwich (which is my all time favorite at Paradise Bakery).  It's a bit disappointing that their cookies don't come with a sandwich (like Paradise does) but they do offer another side like a french baguette, potato chips, etc.  The only special they have on their cookies is that it's $0.99 with the purchase of a drink.  So of course I purchased a drink!
Once you order, they give you a small pager to place on your table so they can bring the food out to you.  I though that it was a buzzer type pager, but it never moved or made any noise by the time my food was brought out to me.  I wonder if there is some sort of locator attached to it that the employees can view in the back before bringing the food out.  If not it seems like a waste of money to have such a device when a simple place card would suffice.  But I can't complain, my food was brought out to me in a timely manner and it didn't seem like employees were walking around in circles looking for the matching order number.
The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is the cleanliness of the restaurant.  There was a lot of tables that had dirty dishes on them from previous customers and no one to clean up.  I saw a lot of customers walking around trying to find an empty clean table, which is unfortunate.  Since I was dining alone I decided to just grab one of the dirty tables which seemed the cleanest.  There was only one set of dishes on the table so I assumed the previous customer was also a lone diner.  I moved all the dishes to the edge of the table and proceeded to wipe off the table myself.  However, when my food was brought out, the employee didn't offer to grab the dirty dishes off the table.  I could understand if his hands were full to serve another table after me, but his hands were empty and fully capable of clearing off my table.  It wasn't until about 10 minutes later when another employee walked by that my table was finally cleared off.
It was later in the afternoon that this all happened so I can assume they just finished off a large lunch rush so it didn't bother me terribly.  It was just unfortunate to see other customers standing around and looking for an empty table where there could have been ample seating had they been cleaned off in time.
Other than that, the place is nice and the food is great!"}
{"text":"What genius came up with the new menu concept? You got the cafe sandwiches, Signature Cafe Sandwiches, Premium Signature, Signature Panini, blah blah etc. You're trying too hard. Keep it simple.

The Mac & Cheese is out of this world. I'm obsessed."}
{"text":"Tuna Salad, chips and a Carmel Roll for dessert. Walkin' down Broadway...

Panera Bread is ALWAYS a good choice."}
{"text":"Got a southwest salad and it didn't come with corn... ummm it's southwest it should have corn. Dude was like it cost extra for corn. Waaaaat. Learn your menu."}
{"text":"Cozy and nice coffee and tea place close to grocery store in Markham Downtown.
The soup is so fresh and ready to serve.  The only complaint I have is that the condiment area cleanliness can be improved. 

This is worth your money. I love their seasonal items such as soup, bagel and sandwich.  They are so fresh and healthy. 

I highly recommend to join the reward program if you are frequent Panera fan"}
{"text":"This location is amazing. I am pregnant and ADDICTED to the broccoli cheddar bread bowl. I had come in for the soup, and one of the managers had taken care of me. He was extremely nice and the bread bowl is always delicious. One of my favorite places in town!"}
{"text":"I go here for lunch occasionally and this is one of those places that you have to get to before the rest of the lunch rush because there is not enough seating, or if there is, there is one person sitting at a four top when people are wandering around carrying trays.

Panera just added a touch-screen order yourself station which was pretty cool.  You pick your food, pick up a buzzer, type the number of the buzzer into the computer and go find a table.  Place the buzzer onto the table and it magically transmits the location to the Panera people and they bring out your food.  Pretty neat technology.  I'm a fan.

I always get the mac and cheese, and then remember after I order it that its just okay.  I do love that their pick 2 comes with a side of bread though.  I love bread."}
{"text":"I come tho this PB location mostly because my mom likes to have lunch here. I've had decent experiences here in terms of food and service but not today. Today SERVICE SUCKED!!!

As a party of three we ordered an 1 Asian Oriental Salad, 1 Chicken Walnut Sandwich, 1 half Cesar salad and 1 cup of Mac and Cheese. 

1. They gave my mom a Southwestern Salad instead of the Asian Oriental Salad so she had to wait in line  AGAIN and ask them to make the correct one.

2. There was hardly any dressing on my Cesar Salad and when they brought that out they took the little number away and didn't come back with any more food.

3. This means I had to go up and ask for my mac and cheese which they gave me and it was VERY SOUPY. I'm a big and mac girl and it was my first time trying it at PB so I was incredibly disappointed in this crap.

4. At this point I explained to the manager on duty how much the service had sucked and that we were still waiting for that Chicken Walnut Salad. She quickly made it herself and gave it to me without saying anything.

I'm not one to start a scene so we ate our food and left. On the way out...

5. The root beer tasted like crap, something must've been up with the machine.

Thanks for nothing PB on Ray, I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love the iced green tea, so refreshing. Get a pecan sticky bun while your at it & you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on 8.22.15 for the very first time. We loved the sandwich and panini that we ordered. The only confusion that we had was when it came to seating arrangements. 

We did get the membership and we are looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I wish they served breakfast items all day. Clean place and decent meals. I love the cinnamon crick bagel. Parking is a little difficult."}
{"text":"My review is totally about the catering. I've been ordering bagel packs and coffee totes from Panera, Waterfront location, for about 9 years a few times a year. Every single time the service is outstanding. Be it through a phone order or online, everything is always on point. 

With delivery they come in and set up everything as well. A really great help for what is typically a hectic morning at work. 

Today I ordered late...I needed three coffee totes and four bagel packs in an hour. I hesitated even ordering because I felt like they may not be able to fill the order with the short notice. There wasn't even a hesitation when I phoned in the order at 6:15 AM. 

I always get a follow up phone call to check to see if service and quality of order was up to par. Nice touch!

If you need catering bagels, coffee, etc definitely use this location. I will continue!!"}
{"text":"The goods them self are great, but the customer service isn't.  The employees where flirting and playing grab ass while there was a line almost out the door  My mil ordered 2 bagel packs and when I went to pick them up, they didn't have her order. Well the order was there, but under Rita not Laura.  I asked for them to double check that everything was there and they did, but when I got home my mil noticed that they didn't put the cream cheese in.  Back to Panera I went.  I just skipped the line and went to the girl that rang me up (She was making coffee at the time).  
I think next time I'll have my mil tell me what she ordered so I can double check it myself."}
{"text":"Their cinnamon roll is the size of my hand! For $3 and almost one thousand calories, this cinnamon roll will temporarily fill you up but give you lots of energy. I came around the evening time and their showcase was half empty. The cinnamon roll was very dry, which is expected if they bake all their goods in the morning. It was surprisingly not too sweet considering the glaze on top. Good snack but it will not fill you up. Service was quick and the store was pretty clean!

Note: they don't have tap and do not accept applepay."}
{"text":"Awwww Panera, so nice of you to join us uptown just in time for the holidays:-)  Major kudo's for this welcomed addition to the lunch frenzy!  I could overdose on the bread, pastries, and cookies.....oh my!  Yes, they have soup, salad, and sandwich options, but they carry an average rating at best in my opinion, so I stick to the sweets."}
{"text":"Sure you pay more for Panera and most Panera stores make it worthwhile. Next time you come here compare it to other Panera stores you've been. 
Notice:  The store is dirty, imagine the 
               kitchen
              The coffee urn you want is empty
              Complete lack of customer service
               Management excuses
Go to Panera Bridgeville or Galleria Mall"}
{"text":"Food taste good. A bit pricey. Paid $25 for a whole steak sandwich, bowl of turkey chili, sm coffee, cinnamon roll and a sugar cookie. Sandwich came with chips also."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! Worst customer service I've ever experienced. I ordered (and paid for) two sandwiches to go and was given one. The cashier clearly had no idea what was ordered after I corrected her. It turned out that they never made the second sandwich. I waited another 10 minutes while they made it, then watched them drop it on the ground. At that point, I asked for a refund and left with one sandwich. Absolute incompetence all around. The manager came over to process the refund and didn't say a word about the horrendous service I just encountered. 

DO NOT waste your time or money at this Panera location."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for a salad at 11 am. Order my food and look for a seat. Every other table was dirty, remind you it was before lunch rush. Sit down and wait for my food. The girl brings my food, I ask for extra dressing of which she replies; I will be back with it in a few min. 5 min go by so I decide let me go to the counter and get my dressing.. the girl I asked was standing there and I ask the lady behind the counter for the dressing.. the girl replied oh im sorry I forgot. Get it together Panera! Wasnt a busy time at all. Tables were dirty and employees dont pay much attention to customers request."}
{"text":"Panera is a good place to come for a quick, \"healthy\", meal. Working in the area, we do not have much choice on restaurants, especially ones with somewhat healthy options. 

This location recently was remodeled and looks great. It is a lot more updated and I appreciate that all registers are in one place, not 2 separate check outs anymore. It is a smaller Panera and depending on what time you get there there is a major lack in seating. The rapid pickup spot was also moved to a more central location in the restaurant, which I don't like, but I understand the \"security\" reasons(I'm assuming) behind it. It just makes it a little less convenient. When ordering you usually get a pager that vibrates to let you know when your food is ready, but they also shout out your name. Not sure why we need both?

I rarely have quality issues here, however it has happened. Staff generally are very friendly and help to resolve the issue quickly. I typically get a pick 2 with soup and salad, or a broth bowl. Soup is always good, and salad is typically ok but always have to get extra dressing!

Overall this location does a good job of being fast and convenient when that is what I am looking for on my lunch!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the service is always good. The food it pretty basic. No one comes here for the culinary experience. Here's my beef with this particular Panera. I usually come for breakfast and I think I've been able to get the spinach artichoke soufflé once. As a business, if you run out of something pretty frequently, make more! Also you can take your ham and cheese and bacon soufflé and toss them in the middle of traffic"}
{"text":"Do not go here. I love Panera, but I really wish there was another location around here since this one seems to disregard sanitary regulations completely when it comes to food. 

First off, the prep people were not wearing gloves. So as they were checking to go orders for accuracy, they were riffling through bags and touching food with their bare hands. Secondly, this is probably the 3rd or 4th time this has occurred, but my drinks went out to a table while I was waiting for my to go order. Not a big deal right? Nope, not until a few minutes later when they realized they sent out the wrong drink and WENT TO GET IT FROM THE TABLE AND HANDED IT TO ME TO DRINK. Are you serious? When I asked for a remake, they got annoyed and didn't seem to understand why I did not want something that someone else could have already touched. 

When I said something about it, the response was, \"the table numbers are confusing so it gets mixed up sometimes\" let me be clear. My issue is not that my food got mixed up. My issue is they have my food to someone else, went to get it, and tried to give it back to me. 

Tossed my food in the trash on the way out. One time I can overlook, but clearly this is a reoccurring issue and one they are not willing to fix. Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"We went here last weekend after working out. I've been to Panera before and have always liked it, but had not been in probably over a year. There food is fresh and relatively healthy, so I'm not sure why I don't come for often. Anyway, we passed it on our walk home from the gym and decided to stop in for a bite to eat.

We split a Thai Chopped Chicken Salad and a Napa Almond Chicken Salad Sandwich. I really liked the fact that they had the calories posted. Especially since we'd just got done working out and I was more calorie-conscious than usual. Many of the items sounded delicious so I was able to narrow down my choice in part by looking at the calories.

The salad was big and fresh. The dressing wasn't my favorite ever, but it was okay. I did really like that the salad had edamame which was an interesting twist.

The sandwich was pretty good. It was chocked full of chicken, grapes and almonds. It was moist without being drowned in mayo.

Panera has really good, fresh salads and sandwiches. They're better than most chain sandwich places. Not sure why I don't go here more often. Maybe I'll start."}
{"text":"Solid little place just like all Panera's.  A bit expensive for just being a egg sandwich.  Bread is of good quality but marked up to a premium price.  Coffee is good just very sugary syrups."}
{"text":"I ordered a pick two and was told later that the soup I ordered and the bread on the sandwich I ordered was not available. Highly disappointed that I wasn't told up front when I ordered. I asked to a manger who apologized and made things right as much as possible. However, she was the one who knew that the bread was gone but didn't notify her staff to not sell it anymore. Good help is apparently in short supply at this location."}
{"text":"Ordered a cob salad with balsamic dressing and I came with onions which don't normally come on it and ranch dressing. Sent it back no onions but still ranch dressing. Took 30 minutes to correct the salad and everyone half already finished eat. Poor service don't recommend."}
{"text":"While I like the food, they're getting to the point where you barely get any food.  The chipotle chicken avacado melt was so small a 5 year old wouldn't be full and there was one slice of avacado.   If i'm paying $5.29 for the sandwich as the 'pick 2' make it worth it.  If I would have just gotten the sandwich, I believe it was almost $6"}
{"text":"They chose not to call it \"Paradise Cafe\" or \"Bread Company\" (I'm from Saint Louis and we call it Bread Company) nonetheless, this \"Panera Bread\" was just as good as the others. So as I am glad I went here, I think the location (near some mountains to hike) was overall better than the food. We would come back, but I think its better for a quick lunch than a long social gathering, like most others included in this chain."}
{"text":"This Panera is awesome! The staff is friendly and food is always delicious! Haley is great at the drive through and it super sweet!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with Panera! I come here every week and get the same things. Mac and cheese, tomato soup, and salad with chicken and avocado. The restaurant has a cozy feel and comes with free wifi. This place is also peaceful and quiet, great for studying with friends or reading your favourite book by yourself. The waiters are very friendly whenever I come here. Panera at this location deserves the 5 stars because of their great food, great environment and decor, great service, and friendly people. Thank you, Panera Bread :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight cause my lady wanted hot soup. Soup wasn't hot. Sweet tea wasn't sweet. And when we asked if the cinnamon rolls were heated up when brought to the table, we got a, \"You can use the microwave.\" These things wouldn't usually bother me, but if you're gonna charge what Panera charges only to get small cold portions you have to heat up yourself, I'd rather go fast food."}
{"text":"I had an incredibly awkward date here, but I'll try to be as fair as possible since it isn't Panera's fault. 

So for a lunch date, we chose to come to this place as it was centrally-located for both of us. In terms of food, I had a soup and sandwich, with an iced tea. When I entered the building, I found myself waiting in an empty hallway with no employee in sight. When one finally did arrive, she seemed impatient for me to spit my order out (it was my first time there, mind you). 

When we finally got our food, my sandwich seemed average at best. The soup was fine. But the iced tea was absolutely dreadful. To the point that I didn't even finish it. The cost of lunch for two of us was more than I thought the food was worth. Also, when we sat at our table we actually had to clean it ourselves first. That tells me something about the folks working there. 

Anyway, the food was about as good as the date itself was. That is to say, it wasn't very good. Given the prime location in Central Phoenix, I was just expecting more (from Panera). I heard all the hype about it prior to coming, only to find myself drinking a disgusting tea and average sandwich.

Uh, no. I'm not going to repeat eating at this Panera again."}
{"text":"I have visited Panera many times. It seems to have gone downhill. Smaller portions and seemed like cheaper ingredients. Fishy tomatoes, mealy apple,  tasteless food and no free bread. Too bad. Used to enjoy this place. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been to a couple Paneras that have the most annoying and incomprehensible iced coffee policy: they put the iced coffee with the hot coffee. This is a problem for several reasons

1) the hot coffee is always at the front 
2) the ice dispenser is in the back of the restaurant

Here is what inevitably happens in this situation. I grab my iced coffee cup and go to where the, you guessed it, the ICE is. I fill my cup with ice and look for the ICED coffee. To my surprise, it is located at the other end of the restaurant with the HOT coffee. I saunter over to the HOT coffee and pour ICED coffee in my glass. Unfortunately, the lids and straws are back at the other end of the restaurant, so I stroll back over to the other side of the restaurant. I put my lid on my cup, then go back to my seat, which as Murphy's Law would have it, is at the front of the restaurant. 

The food thing about this set-up is I can knock a mile off my afternoon run, cause I just walked 3 miles. 

Panera Bread- here is some free advice. Put the ICED coffee with the ICE dispenser! Would you put the hot tea bags over by the ice machine?"}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm mostly here at dinner time to pick up my favorite roasted turkey artichoke panini and sometimes salad and soup as well! The staff is super friendly and recognize when my boyfriend and I show up, maybe because he can never leave without getting a dozen of their amazing cookies! The manager Kaylee is fabulous, she makes us feel right at home and is never unsatisfactory. They may have a smaller parking lot but I guess I have always had good luck with finding a spot! I know I will continue to come back for more."}
{"text":"Panera catering is wonderful! When you have to feed an office and don't have time to do a lavish menu, Panera is perfect with their delicious lunch boxes. 

I tried the Mediterranean Veggie Sandwich with chips and cookie.  Very yummy and bread is soft and fresh!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Panera's and had an OK lunch. The restaurant was clean and comfortable enough with the same decor since forever. While I'm not big on bakery i'll admit the baked selection looked tempting. I also appricated the customer service when Panera's open up and extra order station to handle a small rush, 5-6 people in line.

Order the Pick 2 of Caesar Salad and the Italian sub sandwich and iced tea totaling $11.17 before tax. The salad was a typical Caesar with Romaine, dressing and some Parm, nothing over the top but not bad for a small side salad. The 1/2 Italian sandwich was a bit of a disappointment the meats, cheese a Giardiniera spread was well shy of making to the ends of the bread. Not asking for a Monster overloaded sandwich but a little more filling would be nice for a $11 bucks."}
{"text":"There present special of the turkey sandwich with apples in it was unique and good. Never disappointed with anything I get a Panera and neither will you."}
{"text":"I've had nothing but pleasant service at this location.  They have never messed up my order, and it's usually served within no time.  My only issue is the food.  I'm not a fan of Panera Bread truly.  Their bread rarely tastes fresh or good, for that matter... nor are their servings a good size.  What I mean by serving size is the amount of goods they put in their sandwiches.  I added tuna to my salad today and it was a small amount.  When I add avocado to my sandwiches, it's a small amount.  The price point is decent so I continue coming here but if I had better choices in the area, I'd might opt for something else."}
{"text":"I like Panera. Like. I wish I loved it, but gone are the days of $5 lunch. This is a good location with what is around. Ample parking in lot or garage. 
Service has always been good here. It's not as open seating as the other locations, but it provides a cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ok. Gave it a post Paradise try. Still crispy but less choice with higher prices and that same special slow service. Shockingly, McDonalds would have been a better choice."}
{"text":"Love their food but this location is a mess. Dirty high chairs, messy floors. The servers seem too busy to help you or are able to see the mess."}
{"text":"There is a reason this place has a 2 star rating.  
1) The furnishings are in need of replacement; torn booth fabrics, nicks in wood, etc.
2) The place is an absolute mess during the lunch rush
3)  The place is in need of a fumigation.  Ants walking across my booth table

This place has to be one of the bigger Panera's in the country.  How management can let this place get so neglected is truly unbelievable.  Not returning any time soon on a future Madison visit."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE going to this location. The food is obviously good but what really makes this specific location special is their staff. After seeing me there a few times they individually came up to me and introduced themselves and even brought me free drink coupons and other treats. I feel so comfortable there that I've been skipping going to the office and opting to work at Panera Bread instead...almost every day for the past two weeks. All of them are very nice and friendly but three of them are my favourites: Alam, Idris, and Vanessa."}
{"text":"Must be a privately owned franchise - portions are substandard! Don't waste your money- go to giant eagle and eat in the cafe-  way better!"}
{"text":"Delicious, friendly, and spacious. 

From the outside this location doesn't look very large, but actually there is plenty of space further inside the Panera with dozens of tables and booths. Coming here even at lunchtime it wasn't too full.

This Panera definitely seems to suffer though during peak lunch hours. It can be impossible to find open parking spots in their Boca Park location, especially with neighboring Sambalatte/Grimaldi's/Cheesecake/etc clogging up the lot. Service was also slower than at other Panera's I've been to."}
{"text":"There is absolutely nothing wrong or not delicious at this recently opened establishment. I've tried several items off their menu (pastries, cookies, sandwiches) and sampled their range of coffee in the short time they've been open and found everything delicious. Friendly customer centric staff, an immaculate atmosphere thats warm and inviting. I couldn't be more pleased to locate such a great place, fairly close to home, to write my novels. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"The environment is great.  Staff is courteous and friendly. The food was awesome. A perfect alternative to greasy unhealthy food.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Panera Bread was something that never crossed my mind to try nor to walk into. We went there to give it a try. I ordered the Bear Claw (almond pastry) and a cup of Chai Latté. Both were very delicious and enjoyable. The staffs are still going under training and it is quite visible that the manager - not going to describe her, was very much frustrated with her staff. My experience was very great except for their \"manager on floor\" and the internet issues. As an outsider looking in, it is not a fantastic mood when you see interpersonal conflict occurring in front you between staffs and manager. Hope to see some management improvements!"}
{"text":"Nice place and nice location (especially since the car is being worked on next door)

My chicken avocado melt was good, as was the broccoli cheddar soup. The Mrs \"grilled cheese\" was a joke, especially for the cost. One slice of barely toasted bread and a slick of cold cheese (not melted)

The bad part was a hair in each of our soups"}
{"text":"Poor service at this location.  We do not have Panera near us to always to to hit one if we are in an area and need a good lunch.  I will say the food at this location was not good at all.  In my opinion Panera as a whole has gone down over the past few years.  It is really hit and miss with their locations and we have been to many from Seattle to new york.  This one is a miss."}
{"text":"It is obvious that the \"new location\" glow has worn off on this Panera (south euclid).  

This Saturday morning we knew what we wanted, not like we took forever to make a decision.  Front counter person was obviously NOT in a good mood, slamming down plates and our bagels with quite an attitude.  When we got to the table one of the knives was dirty - not just \"well the dishwasher did not do the trick\", but like recently used dirty, I went to the front counter to ask for a replacement.

A different front counter clerk (not the original clerk), looked at me like I was asking her to donate her kidney to me, stopped short of rolling her eyes at me and shuffled off to the kitchen to get a new one.  I guess it is my fault that I do not want to use a dirty knife...no \"sorry about that\" from her.  

I work in retail at Beachwood Place, believe me I know that retail can REALLY suck at times, but when a customer asks for something reasonable, like a clean knife, treat them like you would like to be treated.

As with many retail food operations, I can only imagine that the original crew that appeared to appreciate customers has been replaced with management that does not care that employees have very negative attitudes.

I can think of MANY other jobs that are worse than toasting bagels, I can buy great bagels from Bialy's around the corner and toast them at home...during this visit also noticed dirty tables that no staff seemed to be interested in cleaning.  That tells me that current management does not care at all, and staff attitude reflects that.  Typical corporate culture, IMO."}
{"text":"I don't like giving bad reviews but this place earned it. I wish I took heed to warning from all the other reviews. This place doesn't care about there clients, they tampered with my food and I ended up with food poisoning accommodated with stomach muscle spasms immediately after eating there last night."}
{"text":"Tried PB again. It's been several months but, sadly, it got worse. 

The intake station was, once again, unstaffed, so I moved along the line. Soon, a guy came from the back and called me back to the back of the line. I ordered  the pick 2 lunch, with 1/2 sandwich and a small soup. The intake guy charged me for two sandwiches and two soups. The cashier said there was nothing he could do and then charged me for the four items. 

As my sandwich was brought to my table, the server said she would notify the manager of the error. The manager eventually evened out the bill but in the process, riled me about my choice of football team (on my credit card) to the point of being belligerent. He was inappropriate and the final straw in my decision never to visit Paradise Bakery again."}
{"text":"Nice decor and nice patio for the summer. Had chicken noodle soup and Mediterranean sandwich.  Feta cheese, red onions, tomato slices, cucumbers, and pickled red hot peppers, with some mystery green spread.  Not a good combo IMHO.  

Soup was okay.  Lots of chicken and carrots and noodles that weren't mushy.

May try it again.  Pastries look nice if expensive.  $2.89 for a brownie or a pecan  roll, really??!!"}
{"text":"I waited for probably a good 10-15 mins for them to even start cooking my food. They were standing around on their phones before the girl who took my order realized they hadn't started it yet. They never came to tell me I'm sorry or to tell me it will be right now. The customer service was shit and I'm incredibly disappointed in their professionalism. Im in the service industry I know what good customer service is and this place does not have it whatsoever."}
{"text":"Apparently it's really difficult to get an order correct. We confirmed twice and they still packed it wrong. 
3/18/17 trans#960 3:42:19pm. 

By the time I got home and realized it it was too late to go back. We ended up with two children's turkey sandwiches. Oh yeah IM A VEGETARIAN.  Apparently people need to go back to training."}
{"text":"Normally we are happy with Panera brand, but not this location. When we got home (10/22) half of our order was missing, so we called them and went back to get our sandwiches that were not ready. Got home to find 1 square inch of chicken and (hard) unripened avocado on each half of the Chipotle chicken avocado sandwich. Overall disappointing experience."}
{"text":"The management is very accommodating when errors are made which has been a lot lately. I would check to go orders because they can be incorrectly made or incomplete. The problem seems to be some employees just don't pay attention to detail. The food is very good but service is poor lately. Food 4stars-Service 1star"}
{"text":"Good food. My tea is never sweet enough but the tea itself was good. Panera doesn't need reviews. Everyone knows it's good!"}
{"text":"Panera has really fallen off or maybe it's just this location.  It's never full so why is it always dirty? Tables are not being cleaned, the floor is terrible and it's not like I go before they close where they have been busy all day. The manager needs to get on it! It takes my appetite away when I see how messy the dining area is.  I don't have a complaint about the food, it's delicious but please get it together Panera"}
{"text":"It's my turn to pick up breakfast this morning. Getting terrific service at Panera Bread. Not sure why the other reviewers had issues. They are ON this morning. Egg bacon and cheese sandwich and an avocado egg white spinach sandwich. Hot coffee. We're good."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick takeout and left very happy. Love the fast check out lane. Was easy to use and the staff was very helpful. Got my food quickly and the staff was friendly. Very clean and warm atmosphere. There are always busy but I still got my food fast and it was made right even with my special requests. Overall a good experience and it's right off the highway."}
{"text":"Messed up to-go order. Ordered bowl of soup, got a cup. Ordered full sandwich, got half. When I called to tell them my order was wrong, they claimed I lied. Terrible service."}
{"text":"Overall: customer service is everything and they got it. 

I am from New York and was visiting some family down in Charlotte, North Carolina. On our last day in Charlotte we decided to go to Panera Bread before the 13 hour drive back to New York. We got there at around 8:30ish a.m. To be completely honest, I rarely go to Panera. I went to order the Turkey & Avocado BLT & a few other orders for my family. I originally wanted the chicken noodle soup but they were only serving breakfast at the moment and forgot to change the menu up front. 


My mother was not too pleased with the sandwich since it was cold. She then wanted a ham & cheese sandwich on a baguette and to have it warm. I made the order with a young lady. This man named John brought our order and unfortunately the sandwich was not in the baguette bread and instead was in a sliced toasted bread. I had told him that we didn't want the sandwich in a sliced toasted bread. We asked for our money back so we could leave because we were on a tight schedule. Also we were unsure how long it would take for the sandwich to come back out since our previous order took about 8-12 minutes.

John was very nice and returned the money back as well as for the hot chocolate out of courtesy. I went back to our table and finished eating my sandwich. Suddenly, John comes to our table with the warm baguette ham and cheese sandwich and tells my mom \"here you go. I wanted to see you happy.\"

Absolutely incredible. The rating for this restaurant is all for customer service. Customer service in this Panera Bread is amazing. The cashiers at register, John and even the lady Kim. Very nice people. 


**If you guys are reading this, thank you.**"}
{"text":"I waited a while at the unstaffed counter, staff member on sweeping duty just avoiding eye contact with me. Surely the manager could arrange for someone to take orders when staff need to take breaks? Food itself was fine."}
{"text":"I used to go to their Henderson location at south eastern and I always purchase bulk/cater for my work, at Henderson my online order for pick up is always ready and sometimes ahead of time.

*** at this fort apache location, I ordered online last night for in store pick up so I dont have to wait for 20 minutes just for freaking a dozen and half bagel toasted but I did!!!

A white guy who seems to be the manager told me that its gonna be awhile, no freaking kidding?!!  

Also, I dont know if this location is a franchise or corporate one, nobody is wearning their uniforms, nobody greets their customers or smiles, they are way way way behind from their Henderson/south eastern location, they should re train their employees at the henderson location."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this location only has 3 1/2 stars. If your complaining about the service folks, let me remind you Panera Bread is a fast food chain. The healthiest one too by review. My experience today is my first at this location and I'll admit I feel as if I'm dining at a 5 star restaurant. Super friendly staff, the guy who delivered my food, checked back later to make sure the food was to my liking. The restaurant was clean and the food was fresh and I felt very much as if I were eating at home  this is my now my go to location! Enjoy y'all!"}
{"text":"The croissant butter here is nice and we happened to pass by. It opens early even in weekend morning."}
{"text":"First time at this Panera. Arrived at noon on a Tuesday and it was 1/4 full. No one in line so I ordered a 'Pick 2', and I got a half sandwich and 1/2 soup. It arrived in about 3 mins, which was really quick. 

The soup was hearty and thick. There was plenty of cheddar but the broccoli was so 'soft', it dissolved. I think, since I was in denture-land, they overcooked it purposely. 

The sandwich was okay but really lacked protein. I realized that that was the most expensive component but it didn't even cover the bread in one layer. Too bad cuz the combo of beef, cheese and horseradish can be powerful. The bread was very good. 

There weren't as many selections for beverages as I remember from other Panera locations, which was another small disappointment."}
{"text":"Ordered for rapid pick up. The half panini (tomato/mozzarella) had no cheese and was soggy...onion soup had no cheese either. This place is too expensive for crap food. Go down the block for a better run Panera."}
{"text":"I had coffee and a sandwich at Panera on 11-15-16.  Coffee is much improved since my last visit.  I had the turkey sandwich w/bacon, avocado, lettuce & tomato w/a side small bag of kettle chips.  Nice flavors and the turkey was of a better quality than last time I ate here; however, it's still not what I'd call a great sandwich and I don't really know why.  The manager, Ryan, comped me the sandwich because of my previous experience at this location.  (Last time I ordered turkey & was given some round, ultra-processed lunch meat.  Today's sandwich was definitely much better.  I appreciated the manager taking my comments into consideration.  It just might be my expectations are too high.). To sum it up, the food is fresh, it's made to order right in front of the customer, but somehow I find it lacking and disappointing.  I hate to give this place only 2 stars but it's my honest opinion.  I do love that at the end of each day Panera donates all unsold baked goods to charitable organizations.  Kudos to Panera for making these contributions to those in need."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visited Panera for lunch. It was a wonderful experience: from the moment we arrived to place our order, to the customer service, food, and did I mention the customer service? It was great. We look forward to visiting again this week, during our Vegas stay. Both of us have visited Panera in the Central Valley of California, and we have never been treated so kindly."}
{"text":"First time here, this location just opened about a month ago. Unfortunately it wasn't a great experience, they were out of avocados and the panini bread. Which they didn't even bother to mention it to us while ordering. They called us up to inform us that they were out of those items, we had already paid. They didn't bother to offer us anything for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"This location is absolute garbage. You spend 15$ for soup and salad and they only fill up your stuff half way to only be told \"there's nothing we can do, you look like you've ate it already\", well yeah no crap it's because your employees did that. I try to call to speak with a manager and nobody answers and I call their cooperate office to get the same experience as this location. All around it seems like panera is a horrible company and I'm not even the type to leave bad reviews. Bye panera."}
{"text":"Impressed with the fast service kiosks! This location is always busy with a line it the door, so it's nice to have another ordering option. There's an option for special instructions on the kiosk, so I took full advantage and asked if my salad could be tossed in dressing (I ordered To-go). I was a little disappointed to see a small ramekin of dressing stuffed in the dry salad... wondering if those special instructions are actually seen. 
  Overall I had a pleasant experience. The food is always fresh and I appreciate the plant-based section of the menu. The new teas are also phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Very nice options, pastries and savories both.  Soups are great.  The chicken soba bowl is delicious."}
{"text":"Food was standard , but they left tea urns stand empty for an hour and a half and never refilled them.  I won't even having my business meetings here any more."}
{"text":"Standard Panera. Good food and yummy bakery items. I'm here all the time, and in my opinion, that's enough of a review!"}
{"text":"Who isn't a fan of Panera? If you're not, we can't be friends. I'm not usually a fan of pre made food, but they do it right here. I love their soups and sandwiches and enjoy the seasonal salads. I go here often for the everything bagel with veggie cream cheese and who can resist the sweet treats that stare you down as you're trying to order something half way healthy. I've never had a bad meal here!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to Panera, there's never any disappointment. Today, however, was exceptionally delicious. I ate literally everything on my plate. The Mediterranean sandwich and Greek salad is so on par with gourmet restaurants. 10/10."}
{"text":"They had a full line of customers with one cashier. Items like lids are not stocked up for the customer"}
{"text":"I always loved this place. From the menu, atmosphere, healthy options and even much happier now that they are finally expanding and opened one by my house. The ordering system in the restaurant makes it convenient and the delivery and drive thru makes Panera bread an exceptional place!"}
{"text":"Although Panera is always good, tonight was a bit of a challenge.  Went with my sister and our parents around 6:30pm. No flatbread, no squash soup.  In trying to combine our orders into pick two batches to save us some money, the employee failed to cancel a flatbread.  When I brought the receipt back up to their attention, they immediately gave me the cash back and gave me a free pastry for their mistake.  

Food was good."}
{"text":"They are lucky that they even get one star because I don't think they deserve that. The girl taking my order had no idea what she was doing so I'm assuming she was new, which leads me to believe the person that should be training her obviously had better things to do. I picked up my order and got back to work. The apple that came with the food was disgusting. How can you say fresh food and be known for having healthy meals when you are serving rotten food??? You would think that they could at least look at the food they are sticking into the bags, must be too much work to do that..."}
{"text":"I like Paradise Bakery in general  They serve great sandwiches and salads.  Great for lunch or for a warm bowl of soup when it is cold out.

This location is poorly manged though.  The lines are always very long for lunch.  The tables haven't been bussed.  The tables outside are often full of spiders and spider webs.  The staff isn't interested in helping you if they are free.  Lines are slow.  Bathrooms are not very clean.

They also had an issue before where they were tossing salads with the salad dressing in the same bowls all day long without washing them in between. We got sick several times, and complained a few times until it eventually got fixed.  It tells you a lot about their food prep standards though."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, and haven't had the issues personally the other reviewers have had.  Maybe it is because I don't get sandwiches here.

I personally like the strawberry poppyseed salad.  It is full of fresh fruit which is great for me as I can always use more in my diet.  They have this same salad at Paradise Bakery.  It is the same here for me as it was at Paradise.

I like this place more than Paradise personally as I can order at the counter and sit down.  I don't have to wait for them to make my food in a long line of people.

The patio here is cute and offers a little shelter and shade.  I enjoy sitting out here in the evening when it isn't too hot out.

The staff has always been friendly to me when I have been there.  They are mostly teenagers/early 20s, but I have never had an issue with them, and they have always been very polite and patient with me personally."}
{"text":"The food was OK. I wasn't wowed to be honest. My super was lukewarm close to cold but tasty. My sandwich was something I could have easily made at home with whatever was lingering around in the fridge and pantry. It was massively over priced for what I got. I might return to see if anything else on the menu is good. It might have been what I ordered as friends have recommended this place. If the quality is good I don't mind paying extra but the time I went to food was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Panera Bread? Everything is always fresh tasty and quick. The staff is always pleasant and helpful and they keep everything so clean. You have to try the you pick two, all of their soups are wonderful."}
{"text":"Typical Panera Bread food (which I love). I come to this location often because it's the most convenient. Overall the store is clean, there is extra seating available upstairs which is nice. 

The problem: they have some of the rudest, most unpleasant employees I have ever come across. I understand this isn't the dream job, but really, have some manners. I have come across a couple girls that are beyond polite and I really look forward to seeing them when I come in. Other times, I dread placing my order because something is always wrong and you get treated as if they're doing you a favor when taking the order. 

Another thing is the soft drink machine is always shooting water out. I don't mean this has happened once or twice, this is ALWAYS an ongoing problem. I can never get my favs; Pepsi or Dr. Pepper, because water just comes out the dispenser! 

3 stars distribution: 1 star for the food because obviously I love Panera, 1 star for the 2 friendly girls that work there and always have a smile on their face, 1 star for cleanliness and a nicely designed Panera."}
{"text":"For the love of all that is hipster! Get your life together! Clean this place up! 

Sunday 12:00 pm. 
Trash full! Plate tubs full! Food on the floor under several tables! Just plain gross!!!!! 

This is NOT business lunch hour!! I would expect a little lag on a busy time when you are pressing through several people! It was a casual Sunday most tables were empty! 

Staff up! And if that's not the problem.... retrain! 

It's a chain store! I went there because I expected a level of quality and cleanliness! When I see a messy dining room.... I can't help but question the cleanliness in the kitchen ((ewww))"}
{"text":"Worst Paradise Bakery in valley...extremely rude staff with very poor customer service skills. I have tried to give them a couple chances, but always leave upset."}
{"text":"So good. I've never been disappointed with this place in any location. The asiago bagel is sooooo good!! I'm not a fan of the passion papaya tea but the super fruit smoothie was great! 

My daughter got the Mac and cheese and it really is fantastic like all the reviews say. I may have had what she didn't eat... 

My husband loved our meals so much that when his came it was a little of a disappointment but if I could go here for breakfast and lunch every day I'd be a happy girl!!! Can't wait for the season of pumpkin soup..."}
{"text":"Came in to this location since I had taken an unusual route to work and decided I might as well take advantage of my free bagel for 30 days reward. I used to visit Panera a lot more frequently when they still had another location open near my work place. Funny cuz true - I agree with Chris C.'s previous review, they really do all look exactly the same, which isn't bad insofar as the decor itself goes, but, really, a bit boring. It wasn't very busy and early in the day so not surprisingly the place was pretty clean, and appreciated nonetheless. I don't go out of my way to come in, even with a free bagel every day for 30 days, since it's not convenient enough to warrant what you end up spending in not only in premium prices but also time and effort compared to a Tims drive-thru on most days. Again, agree with several previous reviews - the prices you pay for a breakfast or lunch are just way too expensive for a cafeteria style restaurant.

The staff was friendly but not very knowledgeable about the difference between a sprouted whole grain bagel and a regular multi grain bagel, except to say that the sprouted bagel is smaller and difficult to cut and toast. Since the sign for the multi grain bagel was missing, I couldn't compare for myself. I'm going to just hope that a multi grain bagel isn't way more than the 240 calories for the smaller sprouted bagel.

I find it highly inconvenient that if you want your bagel with any kind of spread, you have to do it yourself - especially if it's butter, because by the time you bring your toasted bread wherever you're going, it's not going to be anywhere near warm enough for the butter to melt. It also really adds to that cafeteria feel when you're scraping out little packets of butter (or cream cheese, or peanut butter, or jam, or wtv else) onto the bread yourself. Why would I pay over $4 for a bagel with butter and a coffee, both of which I have to finish making, as opposed to just doing it myself at home?

Having said that, the coffee and food are pretty good. The coffee in particular is nice since you get the choice of a flavoured brew (usually Hazelnut) in addition to the regular and decaf. They provide choices of skim, 2% and half and half cream, and Turbinado brown sugar in addition to the white sugar and sugar-free sweeteners (didn't notice whether they provide Stevia). I do find their bagels a a bit \"pasty\" - rather dry with an almost powdery finish, but definitely closer to homemade than just about any other chain bakery. I haven't indulged in an $18+ lunch lately but their salads and sandwiches are also usually very fresh and satisfying. They rotate their menu items quite often and keep the choices interesting.

Their pastries are rich and flaky, and many of them are quite sweet, especially the iced cookies and iced cakes, but there are some less sweet options like croissants. A cinnamon bun is huge and easily split between two people (something you might want to consider given that the calorie counts on most of the baked goods are astronomical). You can buy all kinds of freshly baked goodies and bread to bring home, with many seasonal choices of items.

Their reward program is the best I've ever experienced. You don't have to keep spending money constantly to keep up points balances and you always get an annual birthday baked treat reward. You don't have to buy something in order to get said birthday baked treat reward, unlike Timothy's, and I've never experienced anything close to the 30 days of a free bagel that I've received several times now.

They do offer free Wi-Fi, although it's sometimes very weak. 

All in all, I still come in from time to time, usually when it's to meet a friend for coffee and a sweet treat. The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable (usually plenty of booths at most locations) and you feel like you can sit and relax - it's far less noisy and not \"rushed\" feeling compared to Starbucks or the other usual coffee shops. Overall, I prefer to buy overpriced coffee and baked goods here (even if I do have to finish making things myself) than other chains, especially if I'm staying in."}
{"text":"At the drive through window the cashier took my cash & walked to where my food was being prepared. She covered her mouth with her hand & put my sandwich in the wrapper. Didn't sanitize, wash, or wear gloves. I felt embarrassed but I asked for the manager. When the manager, Kim, arrived I explained the situation to her and handed back the bag letting her know I wasn't going to eat that. Kim went back to start prepping my sandwich. I was watching to make sure my food wasn't mishandled again. She came back and I apologized for complaining & said I'm not sure that an employee that just handled cash should handle food without washing. The manager's reply was that the employee didn't cough. She then asked me to pull forward because there were people behind me so I did & waited a few minutes, but there was actually no one behind me. I went inside to get my money because that seemed suspicious, as if she didn't want me watching them prep my food. When I went inside a man was telling Kim that the self-serve coffee was cold. Her reply was \"we just made it\" and he told her she should try it and she said \"no, I don't need to do that. He said \"I'm just let you know but you seem to like to argue\". I agree. I told her I wanted my money back because she asked me to pull forward because there were people behind me in the drive through but there were not any. I told her I would take it up with corporate & I did. 

This isn't the first bad experience I've had at that particular location but I put up with them. However, this is a health concern for me."}
{"text":"Do not like this place since changed to Panera from Paradise Bakery.. don't mind spending for a good salad but they are stingy with the lettuce.. come on, how much can lettuce be???"}
{"text":"Panera Bread is overpriced and the sandwiches are small. I could make a better sandwich at home. The sandwiches taste like they were pulled out of the freezer and nuked. Nothing tastes like it is made from scratch, especially the baked goods. As for their salads, they too are small portions with little to no meat. Save your money and go to Wildflower Bread Co. instead."}
{"text":"Just stopped in to buy some fresh rye bread and have an afternoon snack.  Their bread is baked fresh daily and sliced on the spot for you. I tried the pecan pastry, heated in the microwave for 30 seconds. EXCELLENT.  Would order again. Great with coffee in the AM."}
{"text":"So I'm wheat intolerant, and I'm sure you're thinking \"why on earth are you trying to get something to eat at a bakery?\" Unfortunately there are not many healthy lunch options in the Northlake area. Providing you order correctly, the half salad and soup selection is one of the healthiest around. Everything is always fresh and tasty. While I do greatly appreciate that Panera's has a list of items that are wheat free - although it's not on the website, you have to search online to find it - is it to much to ask for them to offer at least one gluten free soup a day? When nothing is available then it's over to Shane's Rib shack I go."}
{"text":"Went to Panera Bread to have lunch with an out of state family member. Was very dissatisfied with their parking lot. My SUV would not fit in any of the available spots available, especially to try and take my son's infant carrier out of the backseat. I wasn't sure if we were allowed to park in the parking garage or not, so we left and went elsewhere for lunch."}
{"text":"I can't believe the cashier actually wanted to argue with me about how ATM debit-only cards work. Customer service training, at the very least, ought to include not being argumentative with the customer."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been buying their Napa Almond Chicken Salad Sandwich for a long time. Lately they must be on a major cost reduction program because the lettuce is HORRIBLE - looks like they are using the super market throw outs- and they have changed to such a small scoop to get the chicken salad that you can hardly find it on either half to the sandwich. I have tried other locations (including the one in Twinsburg) they are the same, so it must be a company wide change. Save your money and make your own sandwiches at home."}

{"text":"Went back for second try it is was great!  The soups were hot and service was fast.  The manager fix a minor problem with the bill.  Over all great improvement!"}
{"text":"Like almost every other review states, parking is the major deterrent. I don't come here very often because I don't want to worry about parking.

However, the few times I've been here the food has been good, service friendly, and always busy. People find it an ideal location to hook up on the WiFi and get some work done. 

The coffee is good. Cookies are always tempting and delicious. The patio facing Fairview is a good size. 

To reduce the issue of finding a parking space, walk or ride your bike if you're in the area! I just might do the same..."}
{"text":"Bacon was grey in color. How is that possible? 

Ordered two 1/2 BLT Roast Turkey with AVOCADO. Received both sandwiches with no Avocado. Went to the counter to fix my order and the manager Katie snapped at my wife saying \"For future reference it's gonna be $1.50 for extra avocado\", when it was their fault the forgot the avocado in an avocado sandwich. 

Also, the server guy has very bad short term memory. He brought our food and asked if we need anything else. We said we needed butter. He forgot and never brought us butter. 

The cashier girl was very nice. 11:00am June 20, 2017"}
{"text":"I ordered the clam chowder and Thai chicken salad. The soup was too watery and there were barely any clams. The salad was gross with wilted lettuce and burnt edamame. I forced myself to eat half the salad because I was hungry. I couldn't take it anymore and ended up throwing away the rest. One of the worst salads ever.

This wasn't my first visit. I've had their sandwiches before. Nothing special. Not the worst sandwich either but nothing to entice me to come back for.

The only things I like about Panera are their breakfast souffles and coffee cake."}
{"text":"I love the size of this Panera location. There is plenty of room inside to sit with a large group of friends. However, the parking situation is such a debacle, that I end up avoiding this location like the plague on the weekends. It works when I park in the garage to go the gym, and then stop by afterwards on the way to my car. Otherwise, it's difficult to find a close parking spot. I drive a hybrid, and there is always a huge SUV parked in my favorite hybrid parking spot. Boo.

Of course the food and drinks are the same as you will find at any Panera, so it's always dependable when you're looking to grab a quick salad or smoothie, but because of the ridiculous parking situation, I can't give it any more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"I feel compelled to update this review because Panera has new panini presses that are microwaves, and they suck. These presses do not toast the bread as the old ones did, and they make for an inferior product, as they essentially steam the sandwich, making it a rather soggy affair. I used to like the breakfast sandwiches, but I won't be going to Panera for breakfast anymore, and I won't order a panini for lunch. I don't use a microwave oven at home, as research has shown they adversly effect the nutritive quality of food, as well as presenting a health risk in the form of radiation. I'm saddened and angry that a restaurant chain that claims its food is healthy would use them. Not only are these new presses unhealthy, the paninis are no longer good, as all of that toasty, caramelized deliciousness is now lost. I've contacted Panera, and they claim that they're \"trying the new presses out\", but you don't spend that kind of money to replace all of the panini presses in all of your stores unless it's already decided. Another bad corporate decision from what was a promising chain."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful I had not been to Panera in about 3 years. I use to go to the one located in Saint Louis every other day. I am addicted to Panera and as of today I recall why. The food here is very healthy and when you leave you will be full. I give this five stars because its really going to keep me on track with eating healthy. The quick service and its very clean what more do you need out of life. OMG they should give me my own parking space. I wonder do they do that? Yes when I pull up in front a space marked Sam's space only. Giggles A girl can dream. But I must go I'm off to Panera I've made myself hungry."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time to Panera Bread. 1st time at this location. Wish it would go back to Paradise Bakery. Counter girl had to be told 3 times what our order was. Watch their prices on the overhead menu's you can really find yourself paying more than you thought you were going to be charged. Had the Tuna sandwich, she never asked what kind of bread I wanted. Tuna was mushy, too much mayo and the red onion was overpowering. Didn't have a choice of chips just what they brought.  I noticed all the name tags are hand written. Are all the employees waiting for the real ones or don't they plan on being here that long? Next time I will go back to First Watch just down the road for healthy food. I have noticed that all their reviews don't go above 3 stars.  That should tell you something about Panera Beard. Wish Paradise Bakery had never sold out!"}
{"text":"I have to start by saying I've been to this establishment three times since their remodel and each visit I have been more disappointed then the previous. The first time the staff was quite rude and extremely slow. The second time I was served a burnt beyond recognition bagel. The last visit 1-1/2 weeks ago I found myself wanting to have breakfast with my boys. 9:00 AM on a Sunday. No bagels. No rolls to make their new signature bacon egg and cheese sandwich and no chocolate sauce to make a mocha. Seriously?!  A bakery that doesn't sell baked goods?!  Needless to say I will not be back. Three strikes - you're out!!  Hoping to see this location close and something fresh take its place."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the new Panera. Who stops breakfast at 11am on a Sunday morning?! And the order yourself kiosks, so impersonal. What happened to face-to-face interaction. Not a good move Panera. Should've left Paradise Bakery alone. I definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Yummy muffins, yummy coffee, yummy sammiches, yummy soups, yummy salads.

All around yummy and clean feeling.

Cookies are the best.  If you purchase with the buy one get one free deal, those cookies are better than the ones you get for free with your meal."}
{"text":"This may be a concern that relates to all Panera Bread locations so keep that in mind. Generally it seems that Panera puts decent food out. My complaint is the constant implication that they are all about healthy eating when they offer a single item on the menu that is vegan and it is only sporadically on the menu. The Black Bean soup is supposed to be vegan and is the only thing - other than a small side salad or an apple - that is a vegan meal. 

My issue other than the fact that there is no selection is that the Black Bean Soup is only on the menu certain days and not always reliably. Thus, it isn't worth going in to even try the place.  I raised the issue with an employee and she said they are \"working on it.\" That is pretty far behind the times and how hard is it to put a few more vegan items or to offer the one you have consistently? This is not generally and overall a healthy place to eat and really tries to make it look like it is. I hope someday they catch up and offer some vegan choices and more vegetarian fare also."}
{"text":"Ok. Not bad. Power sandwiches(?) power smoothies(?) whatever... Got ham egg & cheese on a croissant. It was fine. My girl got Agassi cheese bagel with bacon and egg white. She says it was awesome (she's awesome) the coffee was outstanding, I had hazelnut with half n half she had dark roast with half n half. The dark roast is good. We shared a coffee swirl crumb cake. It was fresh and correct not dry. Our breakfast ran $18 and change. The baked goods seem expensive I'll have that next time. The staff was good to excellent."}
{"text":"First; I should not be here because of their people control issues (no guns- stupid I might want to CC) I'm not real fond of liberal policy. Second; I do not subject myself to food politics- meaning, if I want to eat somewhere I follow their rules unless they're totally crazy- let Free Enterprise make it's own way. Third; food- very good! Very nice soup and sandwich resturant with pastries, all very fresh, well proportioned and delicious. I had broccoli cheddar soup and a 1/2 turkey bacon avacado sandwich. I like 1/2 sandwiches. My girlfriend had Thai chicken salad also very good."}
{"text":"So normally this is my go to location I love Panera and usually get the same thing ever since I tried the modern greek salad. But tonight was different the manager Rene that was there wasn't being too attentive I guess because it took forever along with several other guests to get my food the associates were just hanging out and then I ordered a half salad but didn't expect to only get a quarter of a salad. ? so disappointed with this visit."}
{"text":"expensive soggy grilled cheese sandwich"}
{"text":"This had okay (not great) service when it was a Paradise Bakery.  It's been stuck in the middle of the Panera switch for months.

So, none of the benefit of Panera (ex. kiosk) and all the negatives (ex. no cookie for kid's meal).  

Do yourself a favor and find a real Panera if you really want that or better yet, go to one of the other sandwich shops that are close."}
{"text":"I love their cookies. Fresh baked and $0.99 with a meal. Or with coffee. I just go here for cookies and free wifi"}
{"text":"Awesome service! I had a small miscommunication at the Sunset location resulting in a credit from Lena. (Who was very friendly and helpful). Being on a different side of town, I called to inquire using the credit at this location. Without hesitation, Gabe was on it. He said \"no problem\", and within 5 mins, they remade my order for me. 
I absolutely appreciate fantastic customer service, Gaby was at the counter and she was so sweet and polite. We shared a little laugh and I was ready to go. Gabe brought my order with a blueberry muffin, Gaby thanked me for coming as well. 
I had no idea they were located in this area, but I'm definitely coming back. I'm sure we'll be back to the Sunset location as well. The best service ever! Love the food as well as their Hibiscus Tea, mixed with the Blood Orange lemonade!! Thanks to both locations for everything!!!! See y'all soon!!"}
{"text":"I miss paradise bakery's cookies and turkey cranberry but like a lot of what is on the Panera menu. Online it's really easy to substitute items and add on items I wouldn't have thought of. My favorite sandwich is Arugula and Steak. I sub the ciabatta for bread. Add fresh mozzarella and fresh basil, and remove salt and pepper..it's SO good. I can get in the place and out under 2 minutes with my food! Order ahead online and choose rapid pickup or choose a pickup time. Once they forgot an item but replaced it without question. So check your order before you leave. You get a free pastry or cookie first time you order online."}
{"text":"I come here occasionally because it is an awesome place to do work... they have an upstairs which is super cozy! However, their wi-fi absolutely sucks and you will constantly be logged out for some strange reason. I think they limit the wi-fi time to something like 30 minutes which is not enough time to do any work which requires an internet connection.

 Their food is decent but nothing super special. I do enjoy their tomato soup and mac and cheese but I would still consider the food to be overpriced for fairly small portions. Iced chai tea latte is good too but again, overpriced."}
{"text":"Whoever is running the shift at this store this morning of 9/14/17 at 10am needs major additional training in customer service.  A coffee place needs to have hot coffee which your Hazelnut was not.  Also, please tell her that when a guest request their receipt not to pick it up out of the garage can and try to hand it to you.  I mean, seriously what is that?!!! This is a restaurant for Christs Sake!  And as one of your health inspectors for Phoenix why would I want to eat at a place where the manager grabs something out of the trash and was then intending to go back to handling food.  Terrible customer service and terrible food safety practices.    Starbucks is right down the street....save time, money and energy and go there."}
{"text":"I love the food here.  Correction... I love the bagels here.  It's the only thing I ever eat when I come to Panera which ever city and what ever location.  

Panera is a casual bakery with good products.  My wife always go for the orange scones.  I always go for the bagels.  The take out bagels are actually a good bang for the buck.  For about 14 bucks you can get 13 bagels and 2 containers of cream cheese.

If I'm eating in however it's kind of expensive.  I had one asiago bagel with creak cheese, toasted and my wife had her scone.  With 2 coffees it comes out to almost 10 bucks.  

Good food, sort of expensive to eat in.  Besides that I love that bagel a lot..."}
{"text":"I don't know who holds the franchise for this location but they must simply be a blind fool. 

Wow, they apparently let go a guy I never once saw take a day off in order to placate a couple of people I rarely ever saw smile, let alone lift a finger to help anyone.  

As a daily customer who works right around the corner, I know I'm not the only one disturbed by this. Those of us close enough to see what happened here understand precisely what we witnessed: bad management 

I've lost my appetite for their overpriced menu. 
They won't see me again."}
{"text":"This location is horrible, it took them 15 minutes to brimg my sandwich out and they forgot the sausage. Then another 10 minutes went by and it never came out. I told them that I needed to go back to work and to make it to go and they said it was coming up. They had absolutely no urgency and kept putting out other people's food but not mine. This is redoculous and I felt so disrespected. I will certainly not be coming here again."}
{"text":"Dead dog is better than this Panera. Not that I would know. I do not eat Panera.

Not a good place to watch a sporting event. But a good place to get food poisoning and watch fat people get fatter."}
{"text":"Oh man... As much as I love Panera Bread and their delicious food, it pains me to give this location a lonely, single star rating. 

Guigo Gilo, their catering manager, had promised us a complimentary order for our crew since we had multiple issues with previous orders. He claims he has a bad computer system, that he's not getting emails and that's why TWICE now our pre-ordered food didn't get made for pickup. 

Today, when he said it'd be another 30-45 minutes' wait to complete our order (making this the THIRD time for such a delay), I had no choice but to leave this poorly managed Panera site to wallow in its own mediocrity. 

We'll be taking our business elsewhere and I strongly recommend you do the same, dear reader."}
{"text":"Love Panara anywhere. This location is my favorite! They always remember my previous orders and get it right every time!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family. I got the tomato mozzarella flatbread. It was really good.
But the cashiers are not that clear. My family member ordered a greek salad, but there are 2 greek salads. The cashier didn't ask which one she wanted. And of course, ended up with the one she didn't want. The place is pretty clean. Besides the fact that the cashier is not clear, they are nice. Prices are pretty good, not to expensive. I will probably go to this place again if I come to Nevada again."}
{"text":"The service was pleasant. You order and then sit down and thy bring food at your table.  Got the egg and cheese in whole wheat bread.  It was great.  The coffee was also very good. Sandwich and coffee was for 6.99 so pricing is also pretty good."}
{"text":"Its okay nothing special.. food is basically like something u would make at home if not better given the right seasonings. So therefore  i give it 3 starz rating.  Nothing special to taste nothing unique no food experience that would leave an impression only to write this letter to inform you. Hey but the upside of this would be u dont have to cook at home and their food is clean! :) so there u have that."}
{"text":"I struggle with how to rate this place. First off, it feels quite different to than Paradise Bakery and I don't know why. Whatever it is, it's not a good different. 

Second, I HATE the kiosks! On top of the inconvenience, they ask you to tip. Seriously?! I'm ordering my own food, filling my own drinks and clearing my table. What am I supposed to tip??  Yes, you can go up to the counter to order but it's still the bare minimum of service. 

The food is good. I don't ever crave it and only go here if I'm meeting someone. The drinks BUG ME! They have 2 green teas and they're both sweetened. Why isn't one of them sugar free for those of us who like to be caffeine and sugar free?  You can use their cups for water but it tastes like dirt. Literally. All in all, I find it frustrating to ear here. 

All of that being said, I was wanting soup and I knew they had a good selection so I stopped in. The food was good, not great. The water tasted like dirt, as usual. The service was average, as usual.  I tried to give it a 3 but if it makes you cranky to go there, it's a 2."}
{"text":"Delicious purchased the Italian sandwich very good. Along with the broccollie soup was a well served hearty meal a little pricey but worth it I will be coming back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Good central location. I have a lot of work meetings here but they cut off wifi after 30 minutes.  I understand why but there are plenty of other coffee shops that don't restrict you.  I will move all future South Park coffees to MUGS - locally owned and great coffee."}
{"text":"I ordered and received my food quickly, but the customer service wasn't good at all. \"Lori\" was rather rude and didn't have much of a personality, and just stared at me, waiting for me to talk. I got my food and the Mac n cheese was only half filled up which is ridiculous for the fact that I paid $8 for it.  I didn't get the chips I asked for and noticed too late when I already got home. It seems panera bread is going downhill lately, every experience doesn't seem to be the best."}
{"text":"Clean. Glad to know they have such healthy options now. U can't wait to try their smoothly. My kids like the pumpkin spice latte. Decaf, of course."}
{"text":"Is it just me but does anybody else dislike when the cashier calls you Honey sweetie? I always felt it was unprofessional. Would should have called me honey if I was with my wife. H.no. She would have got us both beat-up LOL.
Any way the food was good. 4 stars for the food 1 star for the service. Thursday morning cashier"}
{"text":"I am truely torn on giving them 3 or 4 stars.  I love the food (even though it's expensive and fattening) and I love that this location has comfy chairs and a fireplace!!!  The fireplace earned them the 4th star :)  My biggest issue is that they don't seem to have any adults working there.  Even the management looks to be only in their early twenties.  Most of the employees are highschool students and the management seems to have no control over them.  Their friends come and visit.  I've seen them roll their eyes at elderly people when they ask what the employees seem to think of as dumb questions.  They are rude and definitely have no pride in their job.  I continue to go because of the food and atmosphere.  (I like to take a book and read in front of the fireplace.)  They would get an easy 5+ stars from me if they improved their staff.  Also, just a heads up - while many of the locations have a private room for meetings, this one does not."}
{"text":"This place is really busy during lunch hour! All the tables inside were filled but there's plenty of shaded outdoor tables.
They have fast lane kiosks where you can use a card to order with a tablet rather than a person. You just take a numbered tracker and they'll bring your meal right to your table, which is super convenient. My Greek salad was pretty good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Employees were all really nice. Food was pretty average."}
{"text":"I normally avoid writing reviews on places like Panera. It's only because their uniformity makes it difficult to distinguish one from another. Think fast food places like Mikey Ds. 

But there is a difference here, which I want to note.  This location opened just a few weeks ago and my office has been ordering sandwiches on days when we're swamped. Our box lunches weren't bad. In fact they were very, very good.

I've come here a few times over the past three weeks and their setup is much improved over some their older Mall type locations. Here, you can order on a touch screen (see photos) if you don't want to wait in line. Or, you can have a pleasant conversation with the Cashier. 

I've found their salads to be light and flavorful.  While their sandwich menu has some recent additions. I particularly like their Arugula and Steak on Sourdough. Really very tasty. 

Now, if you are a coffee or tea drinker, they have a wide selection, including some herbal iced teas. Nice. 

Parking is plentiful at the moment, since there are no other tenants in this recently opened strip mall. This Panera is on the southwest corner of Price and Fyre, across the street from the 101 and Best Buy. 

Expect to pay around $10, including one iced drink or coffee."}
{"text":"First time I've ordered a straight up salad in years. Had low expectations for a salad in general. Loved it, the Fuji apple chicken, full size, not half. Plus the baguette was as good as I've had since living in Paris."}
{"text":"Left a lot to be desired. Messed up my first order, then my meal ended up looking like this. Could have saved myself the money and burnt my own sandwich at home.. At least I have an apple slicer."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have ordered a sandwich from Drive Thru and the experience was as disappointing this time as the last. 
1) The wait is long,  
2) I asked for 1 sandwich and got 2
3) When I told them I only ordered 1 the guy who made it in the kitchen started to crib about how they will have to throw it. Not my problem Buddy! Next time pay attention!
4) I could see the same guy and another colleague play around while ppl waited for their food in a line behind me.
5) The sandwich was terrible. I asked for Tomato mozzarella flatbread. I like it without the pesto and tomato sofrito. They put a teensy piece of mozzarella that was hanging out of the sandwich from 2 corner. The way the tomato and spinach were put in was also shoddy."}
{"text":"Another great Panera location!  Friendly staff, clean dining area and super tasty food.  I enjoyed the You Pick 2 with chicken noodle soup and a roasted turkey, cheddar and apple sandwich - the perfect meal!"}
{"text":"I go here frequently since it's so close to my work and I've never left disappointed! I always order the rapid pick up option and my food is always ready exactly when it should be so I can easily grab it and go. The food is always nicely presentable and wrapped. The food is delicious and I always leave happy :)"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong at Panera Bread! The staff at this location was very friendly and the food was amazing as always. I think this is the best location I've been to - they actually have people that constantly check on you throughout your meal rather than just drop off your food and disappear (like I've encountered at every other Panera Bread I've been to)."}
{"text":"Worst Panera I have ever been in! Waited 20 minutes for a salad to stay & half a flatbread! Pager never even went off.  Flatbread borderline stale. Giving 2 stars instead of 1 for freshness of the salad."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite tonight (Sunday night, Dec 10 at 6:35 pm) and almost walked out. However I did order and found maybe 3 or 4 tables that were clean enough to use. Table tops were dirty as well as the floor underneath the tables. Manager explained to another customer that they are understaffed......
I have never seen a Panera this dirty."}
{"text":"Good food modern decor. Good times. Skip the line and order on the pads they have near the door. Then find a good place to sit 

Soon your meal will arrive. Less time waiting. More time for visiting with spouse or friends."}
{"text":"I love the order Yourself pads. I ordered the pick two Autumn Squash Soup. If you like squash sweetened with a little autumn spice it's so yummy! 
Got the Mediterranean on flat bread! Ordered pesto on side it was so good! I really enjoyed this lunch! 
Only thing I didn't like was it was busy and the only tables available where the high tops and my 4 year old struggles getting up and down a bit."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the kale salad and chicken soup . No weight gain promise lol lol
nice ambience 
I Love Their Mango tea"}
{"text":"This place is a good change of pace from the ordinary sandwich shops. Great Mac n cheese and breads/pastries. Have become a regular customer over the years and would recommend it to all."}
{"text":"If you enjoy thoughtful competent employees do NOT bother coming here. Arrived to this location looking to grab a light lunch. When we came thriving the doors we saw automated order pads and thought what the heck lets give it a try because there's a decent line. After building our order to our personal tastes we attempted to pay through the attached card reader. We stood there for a few minutes trying different cards/swipe speeds/swipe directions to no avail. We finally decided to just go up the counter to order seeing as how the line was now gone. The cashiers response to us mentioning the issue with the machine was a carefree \"oh yea, that one's messed up\" followed by a chuckle. If you know there is an issue all it takes it a note on the machine stating so. He then proceeded to ignore us to restock behind the counter as we attempted to order. Very disappointed in Panera. I've always heard great things about the company. So I hope this is a one off issue."}
{"text":"This location is new judging from the recently issued health certificate on the wall (which they had an A) and the staff were really friendly. It was also very clean but kind of hard to get to because of all the traffic on the strip. I got here around 3 and it wasn't busy. My salad was crisp and there was not one wilted leaf. I'd come back again because I love the food at panera and this location doesn't seem to be any different than the others."}
{"text":"Consistently poor service. I had called ahead for pick up orders and they were not rung in 3x.  Separate time I ordered breakfast and asked for tomato instead of cheese. No tomato on breakfast sandwich when requested.  And these are NOT during busy times. This place is close to my house so it's very frustrating to not be able to get something easy."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Every single time I get an order to go, items are missing. We've gone home without food more times than I can count. Of course, now I always check the order before leaving and I'm always missing things. I think the staff is doing it on purpose. It happens too often."}
{"text":"You used to pay too much for the mediocre food to do some work here. Now the remodel just feels like a Denny's.  There's no more charm, no open space, and just stock photography on the wall."}
{"text":"Always order Fuji apple  salad  and never get the right ingredients in the salad , no cucumbers, no apple chips, little onions, and one small cup of dressing. The people that works there are not too friendly.  One time I stated no pecans but my salad had a lot of pecans. I'm starting to think Panera don't like me, but I'm a great customer not very friendly did not want to serve me"}
{"text":"I was starving while visiting Cleveland, found PB on the Yelp app. The place was clean and spacious, my Italian sandwich hit the spot. I didn't realize it came with chips, the worker forgot to mention that but was fine. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I don't understand any good review for Panera bread. I have ordered from this place several times. Never been impressed. Last time was a few nights ago. Ordered the clam chowder and Italian sandwich. The clam chowder was pretty tasteless, with two clams in the entire bowl of chowder and the rest was a few chunks of potato. I will never order that again. The Italian sandwich was a mixture of Italian sandwich and New Orleans Moufalatta. Ridiculous, and not very good. I think this place is overrated because they advertise, \"clean food,\" and maybe clean but it's not that good.  Steer clear, order from another restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm done with this place. Their customer service is terrible and every time we come here the food gets worse. This is the second time that I've tried to order a soufflé they have in the glass case only to watch them put it in a to-go box and tell me they were out of them....You would think if you have a good selling item you might make sure you keep them in supply. My husband got such a stale bagel served to him that it broke the plastic knife he used to try to cut it. Done."}
{"text":"This place is yuppie McDonalds. 

They use a mountain of packaging to package their just above average sandwiches salads and soup. 
The atmosphere is yuppie fast food chic. 
The service ranges from very good to innatentive.

Don't go here unless you want to lose a piece of your soul."}
{"text":"As you walk in the order Kiosks are too close to the door and you walk right into people trying to order or people are walking into you as you order, bit akward, I don't suggest using them. The food was somewhat bland and a little overpriced for the quantity you get. There was fast and friendly service and the place was very clean. If you are hungry and you love to eat be prepared to drop a lot of cash!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Paradise Bakery and was thrilled to see one open up in a convienent location to my house. Like Patrick said, this us very similar to Panera, but I prefer Pardaise. This location is very nicely sized and well maintained. My only gripe would be with the lack of more than one vegetarian option and the ordering comfusion in line, otherwise a satisfactory experience."}
{"text":"I arrived for a late lunch. Service was prompt and the restaurant was clean. Free wifi is always greatly appreciated. The yummy cookie to complete the meal us yummy and hard to resist. As usual for PB, the food was fresh and tasty. I love the multiple iced tea options, mango being my personal favorite.  

One confusing note: what's with all the 15 min only parking outside the restaurant? Who can order and eat in 15 min? The other tenants are a pizza place, kids play land and laser hair removal. Can any of these be done in 15 min? Boggles me. 

I do have one thing that bothers me about PB that keeps me frequenting Wildflower as my first option and PB as an emergency only backup. If I order a salad with my pick 2, minus the meat, I feel like there should be a price reduction. I don't care if it's only $.50 but it bugs me to pay $11 for a cup of soup or 1/2 sandwich and half salad when the salad is lettuce, dressing, a sprinkle of cheese and some nuts or whatnot."}
{"text":"I eat at this Panera almost everyday. The staff is great, personable, accommodating. My first few times they helped walk me through all the menu choices- like their Pick-2, so I can save money. Love their rewards plan with a surprise free bakery item, coffee or $2.00 off my next sandwich! The management goes above and beyond consistently to give a great experience."}
{"text":"I've never had issues with this Panera in the two years I've lived by this one! Everyone is SO incredibly friendly. I hardly dine in because this Panera is so busy a lot of the time and usually order rapid pick up. My order has always been ready on time. A few times I've ordered they've been out of one product and they always go above and beyond to make up for it instead of just saying \"we'll refund you for what you ordered\" which would be what most places would do! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Love Panera's food always have always will. The service here is kind of sub par. I ordered my salad and waited 15 minutes for it. I sat outside because it was an absolutely beautiful day well guess what their little tracker thing doesn't reach that far. I had no idea though so that's why I waited so long. Ricardo was really nice when i did eventually get my food. So word of advice if you're sitting outside and you're with someone have one person wait inside with that tracker thing. And some advice for the cashiers it's probably a good idea to let people know that the tracker doesn't reach that far. The weather is only going to get nicer and more people will be sitting outside."}
{"text":"It's a Panera bread.  They do offer table service here and you can order your food online and pick it up in the cubby.  Always busy at this location, but the food is the same as it is at any panera."}
{"text":"Great food, horrible bathrooms! It's 9 am and they are filthy. They clearly haven't been cleaned since yesterday."}
{"text":"Every time I need a quick bite I go to Panera and today wasn't different.
I decided to go after 1pm to avoid lunch time rush and it worked.
The guy at the cashier was very polite and attentive. I had a chicken noodle soup, a half steak and cheese sandwich and also chips.
My food did not take long at all to get done and everything was delicious.
I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Holy expensive food Batman. My boyfriend has been encouraging me to eat at Panera Bread for years.  I am the kind of gal who likes to spend $3.75 on lunch if I can get away with it and Panera just always seemed so pretentious to me.  When I think of Panera Bread I think of Au Bon Pain expenivse as hell for no reason.  I had a black bean soup and a hunk of bread grand total $9.00 me thinks not!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first experience with Panera. I went through the drive thru and ordered the Pick 2 option and got half a salad and a cup of soup.  I didn't see the price for that although I know it was on the menu somewhere, and was told I'd get my total at the window. I added a brownie to my order and they had to check if they had any left before adding it to my order.  I was kind of shocked when I got to the window and my order was over $14.  That's no drink, just a half a salad, a cup of soup, and a brownie. Just, wow.  The food itself was fine and tasted good, although the salad came with the tiniest little cup of dressing I've ever seen, but because of the prices alone, I don't see myself returning."}
{"text":"Really wish I would have read the reviews before coming.  Don't even bother,  you will be disappointed. 

We walk in and there are about 4 employees standing together in the lobby chatting.  We stand in front of the register ready to order and no one comes to help after about 3 minutes.  So we decide to just place our order on the self serve kiosks behind us, with a sign that said \"to avoid the line,  order here\". No line,  no employee to help you,  same thing I guess!  As we are putting in our order, about 7 other people walk in.  About 3 minutes later an employee comes to the counter and says \"I can help the next person in line\"...REALLY?? Horrible customer service!  HORRIBLE! 

THEN....instead of giving my boyfriend his steak and egg breakfast sandwich he ordered they gave him a bacon and egg...then had to wait 5 minutes for them to make it.  No apologies! 

And they have not mastered making a latte.  Tasteless.  Watered down.  

The End!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few restaurants that my elderly mother enjoys and regardless of the city we are in, Panera never fails to provide inexpensive, tasty and healthy soups and sandwiches.  We have yet to try to kiosks, but find that the lines to speak with an employee are much shorter.  The employees are friendly, courteous and our food was delivered to our table with very little delay."}
{"text":"Check your order before you leave, especially if you order a salad that is supposed to have chicken on it. I used the drive thru and my chicken had no salad. I contacted the store and they offered to comp me if I printed out the email and asked for the manager. That sounds like a recipe for getting my food spit in. I was hoping for a gift card in the amount of the salad, that way I wouldn't stick out as a person with a complaint. But since they are a franchise, they don't seem to have that option. Also, the salads got so tiny? There is better value elsewhere. I would still stop for coffee in a pinch, but even that's pushing it. For $8.99, I can buy a couple tubs of Buckeye Lettuce from Buehlers and make myself a much bigger salad."}
{"text":"Our business park offers delivery service at my job to save employees time on their lunch break. 
The website needs some tweeking. It's extremely slow. Glad the delivery drivers are fast!!"}
{"text":"Had a bizarre experience yesterday.  They have an egg sandwich with the choice of having your egg over easy or scrambled.  I asked if they could make it over hard because when they make it over easy the yoke runs out the side of the sandwich.  They refused.  Thay said cooking it over hard was not an option.  I thought to myself this must be some kind of a mistake surely keeping an egg on the grill an extra 60 seconds is not that big of a deal so I sent a note to their corporate \"customer care\" department.  This is the note I got back: \"I'm sorry for the situation that took place in the cafe regarding the over easy egg option. We do offer three options for the Brioche Over easy Egg Sandwich, over easy, folded scramble, or egg white. We do not offer any other options regarding how the egg is prepared. W do offer options regarding ingredients being added or deleted, but beyond that the egg has three ways we are able to prepare them.\".  

Bottom line it is their way or the highway. I think I'm going to find a non-mechanised place that caters to their customers for breakfast from now on."}
{"text":"If there was any way i could give this place a quarter of a star i would. I have never had such a terrible experience with to go order before. today was my 4th time that i received the wrong menu item because the employees here can't simply read a printed receipt. i wish there was another one in this area. This place is awful..."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Panera in the city. Yes, it's also the one closest to me, but it's also clean and quick. I don't complain about long lines because Panera has quick-order stations and you order from your seat using your computer. Super easy. I never wait longer than 10 minutes, so kudos to the team. I'm often here for 2+ hours working the day away. The staff always checks on me. The coffee is hot and the wi-fi is free."}
{"text":"Large & fast but they forgot my toddler's food.

If you've never had a toddler, this is one of the worst possible things that could ever happen that doesn't involve death or dismemberment. 

resulting commotion sounded a lot like death &/or dismemberment, though.

Two year olds are awesome, FYI."}
{"text":"Love Panera bread but my experience here today was so horrible . I did an online rapid order . I noticed it said invalid try again after I clicked submit with my debit card. So I checked my bank and they charged me for the order. So I get to Panera told them my issue & \" KIM \" pretty much had no clue on how to help . No I'm sorry for this issue nothing . Just said if I wanted my order I was going to have to swipe my debit card again. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE THANK YOU KIM ! & for a pick 2 i ended up paying more than 30$!"}
{"text":"That's it Paradise Bakery; You Officially Suck!
      This place has been in the process of a slow melt down for sometime. The dinning room is usually dirty and poorly bussed. Several of the vinyl cushions have been torn for months. 

The breakfast menu seems the be an afterthought. The picture that I attached is not a pretzel roll...it is one of the disgusting cushions.  To make matters worse, they make a habit of screwing up the breakfast orders.    Last time my Cinnamon Crunch bagel had an onion flavor inter mingled with the cinnamon - the must have stored them together.   Oh...They discontinued the Mango iced tea, which was good, and replaced it with iced coffee. Really? Is that a thing now? Take bad coffee and put it on ice. It is still bad coffee!!! Did I mention their coffee is bad? If you want a good cup take a short walk down to Elevate.
     Today's to-go order for a breakfast sandwich had no bacon. You would think they could remember to put all 3 of the ingredients between the bread. It's not that hard. My wife drove back to the store and waited in line to return it. They remade it but she was never offered an apology. That was an omission of basic customers service.     
     The store management is either incompetent or asleep at the switch. Either way they are doing a spectacular job of driving their customers away!     With the corporate headquarters so close in Scottsdale, it is hard to believe that a store so poorly run can go unnoticed by the leadership team. Being bought out by Panera has either made them irrelevant or they are in the process of doing it to themselves.  Wake up or go on a permanent vacation!"}
{"text":"Lots of healthy options, friendly service, and a pleasant environment. I eat here a couple times per month and always enjoy it!"}
{"text":"First time visitors.  My observation are the lack of information on the menus. The Internet menu is less than user friendly.  Too time consuming to navigate.  The in store menu is not very informative."}
{"text":"Normally a huge fan of the food at panera bread. However the service at this location is below average. I have been to Markham panera a handful of times they have managed to not have an item that I order. No lettuce, no kale, no eggs, no poppyseed dressing...really? A joint that specializes in sandwiches and salads but fails to order enough ingredients to serve there customers is massively disappointing. Not once have they managed to give me what I ordered. 
Piece of advice- take your money and service to an alternate Panera Bread location"}
{"text":"Stopped here this am on the way out of town for a quick breakfast sandwich. Ordered and paid for a bacon egg and cheese on chibatta bread, to go.  Got a few miles away and opened up my egg white, tomato, spinach on some crazy nut bread. Thanks Panera for messing up one very easy sandwich to go. :("}
{"text":"This store is unbelievable. I placed a Christmas Eve order days in advance online and paid. They called at my pick up time and told me they were sold out. The night manager must have missed my order. Sorry. Really on Christmas?  This is the second time that this location has provided terrible service. Panera has really gone down hill."}
{"text":"Panera is the best option for \"fast food\" in my opinion. I love Panera for lunch and dinner.

It's hard to go wrong with Panera. You can eat pretty healthy here if you try. Not everything is healthy, but there definitely are options. I also like that they use fresh ingredients and antibiotic free chicken. 

In my opinion, you can't go wrong with their soups, they are my favorite. Some are better for you than others like the vegetable pesto and black bean soups however, if you get a \"you pick two meal\", you can splurge on the less healthy ones like creamy wild rice and chicken. What is a you pick two you ask? It is a meal you create by picking two items from soups, salads, sandwiches, paninis, and pastas. You get a half of each selection that you pick, which is nice to try some of their different menu items. 

I feel like their breakfast treats leave more to be desired and their coffee is so so. I generally wouldn't come here for breakfast. Their pastries do not have enough flavor to me, they taste rather doughy. For this reason alone is why I am giving them four stars! Other than that, they are great!"}
{"text":"Talk about delicious bagels, I went in to grab a quick bagel with my buddy and walked out with a bakers dozen!  I did have lunch 2-3 times on different occasions, and their broccoli/cheddar soup rocked, it was very broccoli-ey and cheese-y.  The sandwiches can pass for borderline gourmet (pesto, good selection of cheeses and fresh baked artisan breads) 

But lets talk about the cinnamon crunch bagel that Im obsessed with.  I got it lightly toasted and cream cheese on the side.  It was fresh, hot and so good!  I couldnt bear to adulterate the flavor with the cr. cheese, so I just got some butter and enjoyed it with hot tea with honey.  You would love it too :)  And yes, it has free wi-fi so dont forget to get your laptop or your choice entertainment."}
{"text":"Today's trip to Panera Bread Co. was not that great...    I ordered one of their soups in a bread bowl which was all bread and no soup.  I also ordered a half of smoked turkey sandwich.  There was  only one slice of turkey folded in half, a super small slice of tomato, a skimpy piece of cheese.   At least they give you the option to purchase a baked good for 99 cents if you order a combo!!"}
{"text":"I am generally a fan of Panera and I usually get the same thing every time: a caesar salad, no chicken, with extra dressing and a baguette, to go. I have to give this location points for actually knowing that \"extra dressing\" means I want more than a tablespoon beyond what you would get with regular dressing. Also it was the fastest I had gotten my food of any Panera I've been. 

One thing I will mention is that the croutons were soft and seemed like they hadn't even been baked. It was just kinda like crouton-flavored nuggets of regular bread."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy Paneras, and this one has the bonus of being super close to where I live and have class, and their building is really nice with tons of seating. I wasn't too impressed with how long it took to get my food. There was no one else ordering before or after me, so I figured it would be super quick, but once I paid and went around to where they call your name for to go orders, there was no one working the food area. I could see my order ticket just collecting dust out of the machine waiting for someone to come and start my order. After several minutes, one girl came out and saw me waiting so she called for another girl to come out and make my food. Really...? Then while the other girl was making my food, the first girl just stood next to her talking about her weekend. Again... really? Luckily once I did get my food, everything was correct and tasty."}
{"text":"Panera confuses me in so many ways.  Maybe I just was thinking about it too much.  Food was great. Fresh and tasty.  But here are my confusions.

1.  The set up of the actual restaurant.  I never know what counter to order from.  Am I allowed to order lunch at the pastry bakery section or can I go into the \"might be lunch\" line and order a coffee?  It could be that I do not frequent the Panera enough to understand all of the rules,  but it sure is a confusing set up.  

2.  The food.  At breakfast, I ordered the egg, bacon and cheese sandwich.  From the description on the menu board (on the breakfast side), I had no idea what kind of bread I was getting, so I switched it up for an Asiago bagel (great idea by me).  My sandwich arrives with no side.  I was thinking that maybe if they didn't describe a bread on the menu, then they didn't describe a side.  But nothing arrived, so I ate a my lonely, single sandwich..  

Basically, Panera, it is me, not you."}
{"text":"I'm afraid I can't agree with the other reviewer at all. Yes it's a chain, but I find the wait-staff and the management to be very friendly and attentive. The muffins and cookies are GREAT!! I've found the sandwiches to be very tasty.

Also, FREE Wi-Fi !!

I like this place and I'm a regular here.

Keep-up the good work Anaya!!!"}
{"text":"Glad to report this location is doing much better. It's cleaner now, thank you. 

The food is consistently good, and the people working here are nice."}
{"text":"I'm pretty surprised at the lack of stars for this location. I was stoked when I saw it wasn't paradise anymore and have been coming at least once a week ever since. I come for breakfast before work and ALWAYS I have experienced fast service and friendly people. Panera is always delicious. This is a good place and I will definitely continue to come here often."}
{"text":"The tuna sandwich in white bread is my new favorite thing at Panera. Also love the baked potato soup.  They have 5-6 speciality drinks teas/lemonades and they are pretty great to. Need a fast casual lunch spot with healthy clean food options then Panera could be what your looking for! Free WiFi, fresh pastries, need I say more?"}
{"text":"I was in the area & thought I would stop in to  pick up lunch. The staff was friendly & helpful, because I was a little confused to see the kiosk. I ordered the chicken avocado Cobb salad. I will eat avocado on just about anything. The salad was fresh and I could taste the avocado. The poppyseed dressing was a little to sweet for me so I substituted another. I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Way over priced for the amount of food you're getting. $12 for a half sandwich and a small cup of pre-made soup (stated by the manager) and they served us cool bread. 
My vegetarian wife found a small piece of chicken in her vegetable barley soup. The manager disclosed that the pre-made soup that was shipped to their store may have already been contaminated with meat before they served the soup in the store. 
So you would think that they would make fresh soup for the price you're paying. He did say that he would file an incident report and dispose of the rest of the box batch. 
We were compensated for our food, but still disappointing. Used to love Panera, but now, not so much (at least in this location)."}
{"text":"Love it!
Great service and fast. 
Oh.... & the food is great.

Clean bathrooms and nice seating area to eat. Nice place to escape your J.O.B. For a mid day break."}
{"text":"First time here at this Panera. Only giving 3 stars because when I went in, apprx 7am, they weren't busy at all and the breakfast sandwich I ordered was barely warm when I received it. The cheese wasn't melted and didn't look like it would melt if I let the sandwich sit for a few minutes.  Bacon was cold and eggs were warm. However, it's a brand new shop and a very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Asked for no onions, got onions.  Sandwiches were soggy and sloppy.  Wrapping paper (to go order, ate within 5 minutes) had mayonnaise all over the outside of it.  Called to speak with the manager, young girl knew little of customer service.  Disappointed from a chain I otherwise liked."}
{"text":"There's nothing like starting your day with a coffee and a smile. Very curious staff. I've been here several times and always a good experience."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. I've been to many Panera breads and this one by far is at the top of the list. I ordered a turkey sandwich and a soup and it was up to my likings. Never seen a Panera bread with a drive thru and will be trying that soon. Out of all the places within a few miles for the same price this is one of my go to places. I wrote this review mainly because I saw a few negative reviews. I had been a few times to this location and was really happy and wanted to share my positive experience."}
{"text":"I come to panera bread on my lunch break maybe more then I should because I love the broccoli cheddar soup. Sadly this time around the cup I received had soup all over it. I tried a grilled cheese as well that tasted a tad dry."}
{"text":"Been in several times since reopening in late afternoon. Staff very disconnected and not very engaged in what's going on. Coffee's all 2-3 hours old. Used to be a favorite spot. Somebody's got their eye off the ball."}
{"text":"This place is really having issues and it's crazy dirty.  The food has just plummeted, my sandwich had one little piece of steak on it, it was so pitiful, I was just speechless.  A friend of mine has severe allergies to cheese and soy, she told them this, and still put cheese on her salad.  I got a peek of the area where they prepare the food, it was a mess!  I was thinking twice about ordering, but I was starving and my friends were already eating.  I've seen cleaner bathrooms at truck stops.  It's just disgusting!"}
{"text":"This is a decent Panera, but not one of my favorites in Pittsburgh. Try the one at the waterfront instead. Nothing really wrong with this one except the location borders on sketchy."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Panera location in the Pittsburgh area. Friendly, plenty of room to sit, and good quality food & coffee. Panera is a great place to hang out and read the news - they even have free WiFi! Try their toasted sandwiches, especially the chicken bacon dijon."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of the Panera in Oakland.  Often when I have been there the salads have no dressing on them or are missing a vital piece.  Last time I went I ordered a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and they pressed it on a panini press making it flat as a pancake and burnt.  Very unappealing."}
{"text":"This location is hit or miss. I have been several times. The food/service is not consistent. Also the design of store is very poor. If a few people are in front of you in line you may be forced to stand in the vestibule. Other Panera locations have plenty of outlets for you to recharge and do some work if need be. This location outlets very few and far between."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! Delicious menu choices for individual or a small group! I've ordered take out for the office too!"}
{"text":"Most annoying panera ever. The ordering is so messed up! The employees do their best but the system is so confusing that the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing! My advice is stay away till they get their system fixed, or if you go (the food is ok) stay away during peak hour
Update... they still don't have it together! They have YET to actually put the yogurt tubes in with the kids sandwiches, and since they don't get a cookie with the sandwich anymore it's literally an over jellied crappy pbj... even if you specifically ask if they put the side in since there is no overall ticket the person ringing you up has no idea what you ordered and what you are missing! I don't have faith that this place will ever fix itself!"}
{"text":"My Fuji apple had no apple chips and very little gorgonzola (bleu cheese).  The blend had mostly kale and I did not enjoy eating it. The tomatoes were mushy."}
{"text":"They claimed they were out of bread, so now I have to eat my French onion soup with chips (!!) Also, my Chi Tea Latte was cold and tasted awful.
What a gigantic waste of money."}
{"text":"Went to Panera Breads yesterday. I got the Asiago steak sandwich. It was pretty good other than they were very chintzy with the meat. I may try it again but I'll have to make sure to get extra meat next time"}
{"text":"This location is great at expiditing the ordering line. When it gets really busy, they even have an employee work through the line directing people to registers. This location has the DIY registers, too. However, they're a little confusing so if you're not sure of what you want or haven't used them before, just stay in line; it moves quickly. The training manager has been there the last few times I was in. She's very nice and patient. 

There are plenty of tables and outside seating. Staff are quick to clean tables. There's a fire place for the winter and their coffee is rotated out regularly. Lots of people do lunch meetings here or study sessions. All around great."}
{"text":"Service subpar, tuna sandwich disappointing - wrong bread. Broccoli and cheese soup was terrific. Visited Tuesday afternoon 25 April 2017 - east bound side."}
{"text":"the staff: I always end up bonding with the cashiers, usually because something awkward happens and we have to discuss it or it's just no fun.  I never remember their names, but I always recognize their faces.  Our conversations are never normal; we probably make the costumers waiting in line fairly uncomfortable. a It's always a good laugh at the cashiers stand.

the goods: Everything always tastes so fresh.  I usually get the \"you pick 2\".  Usually variations of soup and salad/soup and sandwich.  I have my set items that I get, but occasionally I'll try a new market sandwich.  Can't lose with a soup.  Broccoli Cheddar, French Onion, Chicken Tortilla: they're all very filling and tasty.  And I really like their Greek salad with grilled chicken.  Invest in a Panera card and enjoy a free pastry from time to time, definitely worth it.

the atmosphere: Very work comfortable.  I like the cafe style decor and dining set up.  Booths are the best, but I don't mind the tables.  Table service is convenient, MAKE SURE TO LEAVE A TIP (it's just nice :D).

The first time I walked into Panera I walked right back out.  It confused me, I thought I was in some mom & pop bread shop.  I didn't understand the cafe service; I'd only ever done sit down dining or fast food.  Anyway, moving past that embarrassing fact, I love going to this place.  I never go to work on my laptop, I just really enjoy the food and the peace.  It's a great place to have a bite with friends and loiter for a bit.  I've never had any problems with the staff or the food.  Sometimes they forget to take out the tomato from my sandwich, but I am more than capable of doing it myself.  They're quick to accommodate, very customer service oriented.  And they start to recognize regulars, so you feel more and more welcome each time you go.  5 stars every time."}
{"text":"Food is just ehh. Paid just under $13 for a pick 2 meal of Caesar salad and small bowl of chicken noodle soup with a small drink. Should have been more like a $7 or $8 meal for the amount of food you get and the food isn't even that great."}
{"text":"Awful-an hour before close and all coffee and hot water urns are either empty or cold. told staff and said she will make more. Ten minutes and haven't seen anyone"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through the Panera website from this location. My driver arrived much quicker than the estimate I was given initially. My delivery driver was Aldon. He was very polite and friendly. The food was really tasty as always. Overall very impressed with my experience and the service I was provided. Will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"This is a very good Panera.  In addition to very consistent delivery of food quality (i.e., if you like another Panera's food, you'll like this one's, too), the employees here are just a little EXTRA helpful.  For example, I can almost never clean up my own table.  A nice person in a Panera apron always shows up just as I stand up and says \"I'll get that for you.\"  And, yes, they insist.  Very nice, thank you."}
{"text":"First off...The sewage smell in this place is so awful I don't know how people can sit in here and eat! Health department should be notified. It's a brand new building too, wth?! 

Their floors are super filthy which I don't get because the building is NEW! My toddler crawled in the floor for less than a minute and her pants were black! See pic I posted. 

They are always out of EVERYTHING. Don't know what's going on here it's just awful."}
{"text":"I get tuna every time I go to a Panera. This one had the BEST tuna! White and fresh and tasty. 

Service was good too. We got some soups and a few other things. Everything good. 

One of the better Panera's!"}
{"text":"One of the worst Panera's I've been to. Customer service is ok, they usually get our order right. 

But the food is so bad here! I don't know why. The tuna is always fishy and gross, the lettuce rotten, crispy things in the Asian salad are always stale, dressings don't taste right, bread tastes stale, meats fatty and chewy. I've been to a lot of Panera's and this one is truly the worst. What's going on here? Do they get the day-old stuff???"}
{"text":"I had come over to get my lunch and I had a gift card. I couldn't afford to spend any cash on lunch tht day and was depending on the gift card. I guess the systems were down or something because my gift card want going through but the manager Danielle came over and helped me out. I was able to eat lunch because she was so kind. 10/10 would recommend!  They have the nicest people there!"}
{"text":"Like fourth time at this place always out of things and dirty. Staff is terrible. Do not go here dave the time and effort. Go to the other one in Vegas"}
{"text":"We go to Panera all the time, this location has been off for awhile but today was terrible order took 20 min sandwich was cold and when I brought it back to get it warmed girl cooking was a complete idiot. It was like I was troubling her.  Anyway we won't go back to this location again."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been out to lunch and able to find a parking space here. The lot is small for the amount of businesses in this shopping center, even with the dirt lot behind the building.

I had the Pick 2 with soup and a pasta. Very good. Good quality food, fast service, friendly staff.  

I would recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here and haven't been here in a while, since they were starting to change from Paradise Bakery to Panera Bread. I'm glad they kept most of the same food but was rather disappointed that the portion size was noticeably smaller (sandwich) but the price is pretty high. The food is good but not for amount they charge!"}
{"text":"This Panera, located right in front of the Target off of Hwy 51 in Matthews is HUGE.  Plenty of both indoor and outdoor seating, they have your typical Panera selection of sandwiches, salads, soups and pastries.  The Saturday lunchtime crowd was crushing forward and the staff handled it like pros, keeping everyone moving.

I had the big kid grilled cheese with a cup of their broccoli cheddar soup, with a bear claw for dessert.  YUM!  Mom and dad both got ham and swiss with soup, with mom trying the corn chowder which smelled delicious.  She let me have a taste and it was delicious.  Although a little heavier on cilantro than I would care for, it was very tasty.  

After discovering my love for the Panera, I got one of their cards (like everyone has) and in just a few visits several free things have accumulated, so if you think you are going to be a repeat customer, take a minute and get the card for free drinks, pastries and such.

There is a lot of \"compact\" car parking at this location (eye roll), so you may have to park at the back of the Target lot and hoof it - but it isn't too bad.  It's worth it!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Panera as a brand, overall, but this location provides some challenges that make me not frequent it as much as I would if there weren't issues (and they are not earth shattering issues, just annoyances that I avoid).

I typically get a pick 2 consisting of soup (cheddar broccoli or potato, usually) and either a salad or sandwich.  Varying levels of fanciness make the cost fluctuate.  Salads have had fresh ingredients, though could use a bit more salad dressing sometimes.  The last ham and cheese on rye that I had was absolutely delicious with fresh bread with thicker cut ham. I also usually get some sort of pastry, which has always been fresh from this location.  They have Pepsi products (bleh), their tea isn't very good (both sweet and unsweet, I haven't tried the flavored teas), so I have been going with the lemonade, which is fine.  The last time I was there, I attempted to get the fruit punch but it tasted like fruity water.  Aside from the drinks, they are relatively consistent in freshness of ingredients and well put together sandwiches.  

As with most Panera's, my main issues with this location is parking and people camped out at every available booth with every technological gadget imaginable, or holding some sort of meeting, with one drink on the table that has long since been drained.  The last two times I went, I was balancing my dinner on a tiny table - 1 table (ONE TABLE) of the booths was actually occupied with people who were actually eating and not hiding from their family.  Most people have internet at home, why are you here?!  You know what Panera makes you do?  Wear pants.  I have the internet and drinks at home, and at home I don't have to wear pants (or a bra), so why are all of you people here?  I would vote for one hour of free wi-fi and then you either need to make another purchase or GTFO so paying customers can sit and eat.  Also... the parking sucks, not enough spots, and the spillover parking seems to be along the curb?  I am not sure.  At least two times I have just gone somewhere else because the parking situation was a wreck.

Panera is a good choice that you can make as healthy or as unhealthy (or a happy medium) as you like.  The food here is quite good, even if you have to sit in a dark corner at a tiny table to eat it."}
{"text":"NICEST STAFF EVER!!

I have yet to come in and not get a warm, genuine greeting! I have always been happy with the recommendations and service. They get VERY busy at lunch and still, the wait is minimal at best and they are very good about letting me know when I could save money by doing X or get something for very little extra by doing X. 

This is a SUPER addition to lunchtime choices in Uptown! They are also super for a quick breakfast as well!  

One thing I love, love, love is that there are NO CHILDREN. Normally when I eat at Panera by my house I feel like a day care let loose their demon children and allowed them to run amuck. I enjoy being able to sit quietly and eat my tomato bisque (OH MAN IT IS GOOD!) and not have some shrieking howler monkey nearby while their oblivious mom just keeps on chatting away on her iPhone.  Absence of children makes this the best Panera EVAH!

The free wi-fi is a super plus, too!!

WELCOME TO UPTOWN PANERA...WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU!"}
{"text":"Wanted a more healthy place other than a fast food place...got the Ceaser salad with chicken. They were kind enough heat up the chicken upon request (don't know why people like eating cold chicken in a salad). However, I guess I am just spoiled because there were sooo many white pieces of lettuce in the salad. Feels like you are eating celery sticks, and many of them were wilted where they start turning pink...so needless to say I picked through it but got my fill. Good service so no digs on that either."}
{"text":"I can never get soufflés here. Today I saw them and couldn't even order them. They said they were expired. Why have them in the window if you can't order them? And my wife ordered a French toast bagel, but of course they had them labeled wrong and they were out of them. It was a sad day at panera!"}
{"text":"Panera used to be better I think. Just wasn't impressed with this location. My salad was over dressed and the kids Mac and cheese was soupy. We won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"The interior is very nice , incredibly spacious and decorated in warm earth tones and caramel hues and they have free wifi. I noticed that a lot of the booths were occupied by teeny boppers that appeared just to be chillen as if they were in a public library.

My reason for visiting Panera Bread was to treat myself and my mom to a healthy early dinner.  I had the caesar side salad with a creamy tomato soup and my mother had the grilled chicken caesar salad.  The food was just okay. The food for me was a bit bland.  Our salads were undressed."}
{"text":"First time trying Panera because let's face it, when it's 100 and holy crap out who wants soup? Well i'm willing to make the exception now! First off customer service was great, the staff is really friendly and inviting. Also, thank you fo rmy panera perks card. 

The portions are plenty filling. I didn't think soup and salad was going to fill me that easily but it made for a great lunch.

I had the cream of chicken and wild rice soup which was great and my husband had the broccoli and cheese in a bread bowl. (The breads are super fresh btw). I've tried so many times making cream of whatever soups but Panera has made it so much easier. Plus, crockpot for two in soup is kinda of an overkill. So thank you panera, we will be returning for many lunches!"}
{"text":"Very impressed by the professionalism and accuracy of orders taken. I ordered for my co-workers as well and they got everything and speedy. They will definitely see more business from me"}
{"text":"Service and staffing here is abysmal. 

Used the restrooms and they were disgusting and lacked toilet paper.

We've been waiting for our food far too long for food that is already prepared and just needs to be slapped onto a plate. The food is not that great for this long of a wait. We're approaching on 30 minutes. May as well gone out for a sit down meal.

This is the worst Panera experience of my time. And there have been many."}
{"text":"Basically good. Only ordered a premium salad to redeem Amex Offer. Not so impressed."}
{"text":"Love the fact everything is fresh but things run out fast. sigh. The price is good for fresh and some organic things."}
{"text":"GREAT food and great service!  A little pricey, but not out of hand.  My husband was expecting bigger portion sizes, but it was fine with me."}
{"text":"I live way out in 'old' Henderson, literally the last exit off the freeway before Boulder City, but I drive my son to baseball practice at Bruce Trent Park, off Rampart in Summerlin. In my attempt to be less of a hermit, I'm attempting to explore this 'new' area instead of sitting in the car for 2 hours during practice.

 Boca Park is becoming my favorite. As a Mom, it's rare to get free/alone time, and my 2 'free' hours when my son has baseball practice has become my excitement during the week day. I explore Boca, grab a coffee and roam stores. The store roaming every Tuesday hasn't been nice to my wallet, so I thought I'd try the 'have a meal and catch up on some reading'. Panera has become my haven.

 Employees are always friendly, my favorite creamy tomato soup is always warm and tasty, and no one bothers me when I sit for an hour and a half, with an empty plate of food and my nose in a book. 

 Thank you for opening a Panera in Boca Park. Fresh bread dipped in creamy soup, and sometimes a sweet treat for an extra 99 cents is just what I need every now and then. Perfect prices, atmosphere, and location."}
{"text":"Definitely obsessed with this place! I always get their chocolate pastries and Mac and cheese, which I would say are the best things on the menu. 

I would recommend this to a friend anytime for a quick and easy breakfast, lunch, or dinner. 

If there is ever anything you don't like they will give you your money back too."}
{"text":"I assume that given the prices that Panera Bread charges that the quality would be high.  This is not the case.  We got a whole coffee cake for a business meeting and it was COMPLETELY dry and we ended up throwing it away.  My wife has a saying that \"it is not worth the calories\" and this certainly wasn't.  Will NEVER go back to a Panera again.  Good thing you're being bought out by a coffee company . . .maybe they can straighten things out."}
{"text":"Doesn't matter which location quality and selection of food just nowhere as good as Paradise Bakery was. 
Sorry Panera ever bought them out."}
{"text":"We stopped in this morning to the newly remodeled Panera Bread and enjoyed a quick breakfast.  I had an everything bagel with onion and chive cream cheese and my husband had a sausage, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich.  Friendly service, nice atmosphere and consistently good Panera food!"}
{"text":"I love Panera in general, but this location isn't the best. I've tried to get dinner past 6 pm several times and they've been out of necessary ingredients. Also, the local high school (?) hoodlums tend to frequent this location. Try the one in Oakland or at the Waterfront instead."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday nite Aug 2, 2013 @ 8 pm   This is the biggest Paneras I've been in.  But I think it may be an Albatross after experiencing my dining experience and reading other's reviews, see Laura A's review.  

The service at the register seems impatient.  All of em have an, \"Us against them\" attitude.  Like they're not content working here and are waiting for that next job.  

They ran out of the bearclaw and carrot cake pastries.  They still had a flow of customers coming in.  

Bathroom had a pile of garbage in bin overflowing.

But the food was good tonite and we didn't have to wait long."}
{"text":"I visited this location tonight while we are staying at PCH with my daughter. I was a huge fan of Paradise Bakery previously and have visited Panera's several times while out of state. 
It's 6 o'clock on Saturday, 4 hours from closing time. The cookie display is very picked over, but states \"We'll bake more...\"
The lady at the register said they weren't baking anymore today, my reply was \"you really should take the sign down!\"
I order, go to choose cookies and there's a hair on one! I have an eye for this, it happens more frequently than I'd like to admit.
I went to get iced tea and it tasted rancid? Again maybe it's been there all day, so I dumped it and stuck with lemonade. It was so so, nothing like Chick-fil-A lemonade.
Finally, they call my name to pick up my to go order, and I check it, my soup is missing! I said my soup is not in here, she replied \"oh I didn't even see it!\"
Food was okay, not PB that I remembered, service is to be desired. 
I would probably only visit again if I'm in the area and my daughter wants mac n cheese. For $40 you can find a better meal!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. There was almost no customers and I waited FOREVER for my food. The staff all seemed unenthusiastic as well as pretty hungover. When we got our food and smoothies, it all tasted like rubbish. We asked to talk to a manager and he was very rude with us and acted like we were being unreasonable. This store definitely needs some help!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, out of numerous items at dinner rush (bad management planning). Hardly any clean tables and no employees seem to care. Sorry that they took over the beloved Paradise Bakery that offered much better value, service and good food."}
{"text":"Usually Panera is a great place to get decent, quick food. Most of the time I am happy with my orders, although I always feel like it is overpriced for the portions you get (but I feel that way with every Panera). Today I ordered a potato soup bread bowl, and the modern caprese sandwich. The employees did not mention they were out of potato soup, and subbed it for clam chowder instead and did not tell us. My modern caprese, which I made a few modifications to (no cheese, add avocado) came with no white bean puree - the one thing I was most excited about (not an add on - it was already part of the sandwich). I called to explain the issue and the manager Paul was very apologetic and offered free pastries and free delivery for the trouble. While I am very appreciative of his efforts, the new sandwich did not come with the modifications. I know this seems minuscule and nit-picky, but after getting the order wrong the first time, I would've hope the employees would take the extra time to ensure the original order did not contain any modifications. This won't stop me from eating there - but maybe less often and now I'll be sure to double/triple check my food to ensure it is correct and I would advise everyone else to do the same."}
{"text":"ATTENTION ALL SALES REPS!  If you do lunches for customers all the time this location delivers and also is a fabulous go to when you are in a pinch!  I had a meeting time change which cut my prep time down by 2 hours!  Eeekkk!  I hadn't called in an order or placed one online anywhere and I called around and was declined the option to place a large order so last minute. 

The team at this Panera location stepped up!  They not only took care of me but had it all packed up and ready the moment I walked in. I also previously used this location to send lunch to a few different customers which ended up helping me eventually close the business. 

I can't express how much it means to me that a business values my business at the level they do so that I may go out and care for my own customers with their products."}
{"text":"Haven't been here since the switch from Paradise. Paradise was a nice place with a lot of activity. Panera was dead during a prime time on Sunday and I can see why. The price was outrageous, I could have got a steak dinner for what I paid. I had a BOGO coupon which was not expired, but the cashier couldn't get it to work and refused to honor it, told me it was my fault for ordering extra food BEYOND what was required on the coupon (I added two kids meals). Cookies were hard as a rock and gross. Service was slow. This place won't last long and it doesn't really deserve to. I will not return."}
{"text":"Stopped at Panera this morning for the first time. Bought a blueberry muffin at the drive through and drove to my office. Cut the muffin in half and there were no blueberries inside. There were three on the outside edge of the paper cup. Very unhappy!,"}
{"text":"Alright guys, I never write reviews for places. And when I do, they're usually always great. But man was service bad here. 

I just want to start off by saying that I'm definitely not an impatient person. I've been in food service so I know how it is! When I ordered, my receipt said 12:12. Not only did I go to the bathroom and refilled my drink but I stood and waited until 12:22 when they called my name, I had looked at my phone. There wasn't even a line.. maybe two people in front of me. Went and sat outside which was nice, but they made my sandwich wrong. I ordered a frontega chicken panini, and they gave me a sandwich with only plain chicken on it. Ok, no big deal. Mistakes happen. 

Now, at this point I was kinda frustrated because I was on my lunch break and had to be back at 12:45 so time mattered. I went back to the food station to try to get someone's attention, with no prevail. Finally Delilah, who was handing out orders looked at me and told her that this was wrong. She asked what I had, and when I told her she grabbed the sandwich from me, looked at it, rolled her eyes and THREW it a few feet into the trash can (which half the sandwich fell on the floor. Lol.) 

They made me another sandwich but then they took it off the grill and it was just sitting there... but I finally got the guys attention and he gave it to me right away. So he was nice. 

Like I said, I never make reviews or complain. But I've been to Panera everywhere. In stow, chapel hill, brimfield, Fairlawn, off the turnpike. And I've never been treated like that. I get that your job can be stressful but jeez. If you hate your job that bad then girl just quit and find something that has nothing to do with customer service! I'm sure there's way more friendly people who would love to have your position."}
{"text":"Pros: 
*Friendly staff
*Quick service 
* The new additions to the menu

Cons: 
* Sometimes they're clean and other times not so much"}
{"text":"The location is clean and the staff was frendly.  When I arrived the coffee was fresh (3:00 pm). They have free WiFi but the music is loud for a coffee shop kind of setting. You can work out of this location but with the loud music it would be had to make a business call."}
{"text":"The first time I saw Panera Bread, I wasn't sure what to expect. But once I went inside and order the food and ate, I was very delighted by the great food and service. I highly recommend go to Panera Bread. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"I ordered a caesar salad with no chicken and they put chicken in it, and my friend also ordered a chicken noodle soup in a bowl but he got a cup instead. He had also ordered an extra bag of chips, but did not get it. Food came out fast and it was good, just wish our order was correct the first time."}
{"text":"Typical Panera quality with added convenience at this location.   This location has a drive thru which is unique for Panera and is always mobbed.  This location also has a monstrous covered patio with screened sides and a smaller uncovered patio on the side.  I felt like the dining room was a little larger than most Paneras and had a good mix of tablw types.   The service area is a little smaller and crowded, but the staff works with it well.  This location ia close to the road with good visibility in a crowded shopping center.  Panera lost a star because the parking lot is small and crowded - I felt like I was in a real life game of Frogger getting in to it.

This Panera is a great place to have a business meeting."}
{"text":"I enjoy the salads here and the convenience of the kiosk ordering system. The downside to Panera is the soup is always luke warm and the portions are very inconsistent."}
{"text":"What happened to the portion sizes?? I ordered a full Italian sandwich and got two tiny halves of something disappointing.  It looked like two sliders.  NOT WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"I am not the biggest fan of Panera.  I think they are fine, but in general a little overpriced for what you get.  I have eaten at many locations over the years and usually the experience is standard, not great not bad.  However, I have always enjoyed one particular thing about Panera, and that would be their soups.  I am a soup junkie especially when the weather turns cold.  That being said I have had some not so great experiences.  

My last visit to Panera was prompted by a \"coupon\" of some type loaded onto my Panera member card.  I advise everyone who stops here even occasionally to get one.  I have redeemed points for money off meals/drinks and free items, such was the occasion that day.  I received a free pick two with the purchase of a drink.  I went with Roasted Turkey & Avocado BLT which they panini pressed for me, and a cup of baked potato soup.  Now the Turkey BLT and Avo is a go to for me.  I usually enjoy it, so this was totally on me for asking for it to be pressed like a panini.  It made the veggies warm and soggy and avocado heated isn't the best flavor.  However, I still overall enjoyed the sandwich.  My big issue was the soup.  Absolutely not good whatsoever.  It was mushy and had basically no flavor, minus an unusual aftertaste that was not appealing in any way.  I ended up pitching it after only a few bites.  I also tried their autumn soup last year, and though I hear some rave reviews about this I also felt this soup was not good.  It had a very metallic flavor with a funky aftertaste too.  Eh there are winners and losers in the game of soups, most of Panera's soups are winners, and then there are these two.  However, the Broccoli and Cheese is bombdiggity.  

Don't forget to sign up for that member's card, free dessert on your birthday!"}
{"text":"Done with this place. They alway get my order wrong anyway! The asst. Manager is a little man with a I'm right addituded. They no longer have the monster cookies I love. I wanted to get the pack of smaller cookies for 99 cents and he said the weren't part of the 99 cents. I said I remember getting them before. I'm disappointed. He said to me \" just so you know they have never been part of the 99cents and I should know I have been here since the 99cents rolled out!\" Wow what a little pr***. This is why I won't be back just so you know being right to a customer drives us away! Take a clue and be humble being right isn't that important."}
{"text":"I'm @ panera 5 days a week and its always five stars. All the staff and management are great. Nick, Luke and Angela are always more than helpful. When it comes to food it's hard finding a place that's consistent. I highly recommend the bagels they are soft and fresh and perfect to start the day."}
{"text":"I like this Panera bread, more than other ones.    Why?  Because it's cleaner and the seating section is a bit more segregated from the cashier so you feel more comfortable.  

For their grand opening, they were giving away $10 gift cards until December 31, 2013. Being the cheapy that I am, I found 5 of these coupon voucher thingy's and went in to claim all of them (hey, it didn't say a limit) and surprisingly, the cashier obliged. I was shocked.  So needless to say, good service.  

As for the food, it's your typical Panera food.  Nothing too over the top, nothing great, everything average.  However, what I had for the first time was a cinnamon roll.  I ordered two of them and they gave us a nice little box to put them in.  Points for that. As for the taste, it's not overly glazed or overly sweet and actually taste like cinnamon unlike Cinnabon  rolls which taste like sugar rolls.

Verdict: Cool little coffee shop addition to this little plaza."}
{"text":"The food at Panera is really good and I love that they use healthy ingredients.  

The service at this particular Panera suffers because it is such a popular place.  We visited at lunch time on a weekday and the restaurant was jammed.  It wasn't clear to me where to go - get in line or to a table?  After ordering, then where to sit?  People were standing everywhere waiting for their orders.  It took quite awhile to get our order.  

I would definitely return to Panera but maybe not this particular Panera at lunchtime."}
{"text":"I like Panera a lot, and the experience and food is usually pretty good.  This visit (this location) was just ok.   I met friends for a committee meeting at 6:30 on a Thursday night.  There were 2 cashiers and an impossibly long line and absolutely NO sense of urgency.  When I finally reached the register, I placed my order for \"pick 2\", chicken cobb salad and chicken noodle soup.  I stepped down to wait for my order, which I watched the workers sloppily prepare.   I asked for butter for my baguette and the food prep person, pointed me to the condiment station....there was no butter, nor an empty container for it:-(.  I didn't bother to ask again.   I sat down to eat my meal, and the outside of the soup bowl was messy and wet, not because it was filled to overflowing, but because it had been dumped in the bowl.  The salad was not at all appealing to the eye.  Instead of slices of avocado, I had two big messy, mushy scoops and 2 large pieces of boiled egg, placed on top.

This location could definitely use some more training and oversight."}
{"text":"The food here is always delicious. I love their Power Breakfast Egg White Bowl with Turkey. So good."}
{"text":"I love this place.
Their soups, salads, sandwiches all taste delicious...you can't go wrong.

I always get the \"Pick 2 combo\" and it costs $7.99.
You can choose any 2 items from the lists of sandwiches, salads or soup and it comes with a choice of chips or fruit (i think?). Soup and sandwich is the way to go.

NOTE: It CAN get crowded/busy during weekday lunch hours. So plan accordingly if you a pressed for time. Also, parking can suck. It's a pretty good sized parking lot but with all the other restaurants and stores in this plaza, it can fill up pretty quick."}
{"text":"I don't eat at chain restaurants often, but I don't mind going here. The staff here are helpful and the food is fresh."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Panera location, but it tends to get quite busy at lunch time when all the students come in. Still, great food, good coffee & pastries, and free WiFi; what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"One of the worst Panera experiences I've had. I ordered ahead of time using their iPhone app, and when I arrived the food was not ready even though it was supposed to be, and the staff seemed unsure of how to make the things I had ordered. They were running out of stuff, and had to substitute something else for the avocados, only had one flatbread left, etc. The food itself was pretty blah. I won't be going back unless I'm starving."}
{"text":"CHECK YOUR FOOD.  Someone here needs to be fired and HQ will be notified for REAL changes.  Ordered egg bakes commented vegetarian, received something I did not order- one with meat.  Manager refunded order ($9.00) and double it ($18.00) but heads should roll.  IT was ham, violates many dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"I placed what is called a \"Rapid Order\" with Panera Bread in Twinsburg OH. It is a \"to go\" order.  You place the order online and pay for it online and it will be ready for you to pick up in 5 to 10 minutes.  I ordered 1/2 Southwest Salad and a cup of chicken soup.  The salad dressing was missing from the salad when I arrived back to the office to eat my lunch.  I called an 800 number to Panera that was on the emailed receipt that I received.  The agent on the call told me that unfortunately the Twinsburg location is a franchise and he cannot do anything about the issue other than forward the information to the Twinsburg location.

Anyway, the salad was pretty bad without the dressing.  The dressing makes the salad.

Panera Bread is not a cheap lunch.  This lunch costs me $9.78. So, for this very steep, premium price, I expected a whole lot more for the money I spent.  

Well, someone named Brandi from the Panera Bread in Twinsburg called. She said she was very sorry for the mishap. I was expecting her to offer me a free salad or sandwich on my next visit for their error. Nope, she did not off a free salad or sandwich.  She offered me a cookie or a  free beverage on my next visit.

I do not purchase cookies or drinks on carryout meals. I was expecting a better fix from Panera Bread. I very disappointed.  I am diabetic and even if I weren't, I still would not be purchasing cookies and soft drinks. They are unhealthy.

By the way, the soup was also cold.

If you go here for carryout, check you bag for all the details like salad dressing and other condiments before leaving.  You would think at $9.78 for 1/2 salad and a cup of soup they could do better."}
{"text":"Restaurant part was clean and the girl who waited on me was super friendly... But I was really annoyed when the chai tea latte she made contained 3/4 cup of chai!! Was too annoyed to take it back. Warm choc chip cookie was on point! 


Update: strike 2 for this Panera! got a shortbread cookie today and also ordered a large skim latte. After the girl made my drink, she handed me a regular size latte. When I looked at my receipt I noticed I had only been charged for a regular latte so I asked her if she can make me a large like wanted, and that I would pay the difference. I shouldn't have even had to ask her to make my drink again, but looks like this is the type of customer service they have at this particular Panera. I used to work there back in the day for three years and their motto is the customer is always right. Would be nice to see a little bit of action on behalf of that. 



Update 5/15/16
Grabbed dinner for my husband and I on a Sunday evening. Ordered extra onions on my sandwich and got no onions at all. Front Tega chicken was extremely soggy and there's usually some type of greens on them which I did not see this time. Pretty sloppy preparation, and asked for whole-grain baguettes with the group soup and only got one piece WG and the other 3 white. Called the restaurant and asked about entering my receipt number online to get the myPanera points. The manager that was working on this evening reported she did not know how to enter the card information on the website and that \"we have nothing to do with my Panera card system\". Honestly, I paid $42 for this meal, so you'd think you could make at least an attempt to accommodate me. She took my name so that I could get a free sandwich the next time I stopped in. She also insulted me by asking if the receipt said extra onions-like it was my fault. Not the best experience."}
{"text":"I visit Panera twice a week
They are friendly and have
Great food in addition I left
My book and called and the saved
For me"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep going back to Panera. Each and every visit is a negative experience. Today, I ordered SCRAMBLED EGG, BACON and CHEESE on a plain bagel. 
What I got was bacon and cheese, NO scrambled egg. I didn't bother staying to complain. I just left the sandwich and walked out, because this time... I'm done. 
Why bother dealing with a restaurant that doesn't value you as a customer. 

That's how Panera makes me feel. Like my money and my patronage doesn't warrant reasonably expected quality."}
{"text":"This is THE best panera I've gone to from the east coast to the west! I've spent many hours in this place across the country studying and this one is just amazing! They have a few exceptional employees, especially Cole, who seriously works his tail off! He takes care of busing all the tables, brings out orders, does special requests.. Just watching him work made me appreciate this place even more! Great experiences and I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Always like Panera food. Well run location. I wish they would get a drive-thru. Service has always been good for me here."}
{"text":"This national chain is going to save my life because it is probably one of the healthiest chains now available in most locales across America. I had the kale salad with the French Onion Soup. Yes, maybe the soup is a little salty - but hey, salt gives flavor. The kale salad is new and has the name ingredient, romaine, parmesan, some sort of little wafer-like crouton and chicken. They give a 1/2 lemon and simple olive oil for dressing. Delicious! Oh, and get the unsweetened Acai Iced Tea! 

Maybe they have new management, maybe I was there on a good night, maybe I'm not that critical... I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about... service was friendly and professional... and no Panera is quick, duh, it's considered slow fast food just like 5-Guys and some other relatively new chains, you have to wait 5-10 minutes for your food because they make it to order. When you expect that and you see they are especially busy, I suppose 15 minutes could happen. I don't know. I had a good experience here and I enjoyed my meal. It sure beats MacDonalds...Cheers!"}
{"text":"Awful. I went tonight, December 3 at 5:45pm through the drive thru. When I arrived at home, my salad came without dressing, my sandwich was completely wrong. I asked for a turkey sandwich, they gave me chicken salad. Oh and my diet pepsi, they gave me regular pepsi. $13.59 for something I can't drink or eat. Never going back. Awful"}
{"text":"This is not the best panera bread I have been to. But its the only one in the area and the closest one is 20 minutes away. Its usually packed and the seats are limited. Otherwise the place is clean and tidy. Their coffee and tea are served in a mug with free refills. The food is pretty good here. If you are here for lunch make sure you try their soup in a bread bowl. They have free refills on iced tea and cold drinks too. Staff here are very friendly and cooperative. WiFi is terrible here as it keeps disconnecting and on busy hours they have 30 minutes limit."}
{"text":"The food was good, however, I don't feel it was worth the price. My husband and I got the half-sandwich and half-salad for $26 dollars. That was quite a bit of cash for half of a sandwich. This was our first time trying Panera. For what it's worth, I feel that Zupas is much tastier and better on the wallet. I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich and they said they were out of American cheese..ouch. The salads were fresh and yummy but they dressing was only filled half-way. Wasn't enough to enjoy my salad without feeling like a rabbit just eating lettuce."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre compared to other Paneras I've been to. First floor internet is not dependable at all. 2nd floor is good. Service could be a lot better, but overall store is clean, organized, and beautiful."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and there was a line which is expected.if there was no line during lunch I would be worried. I ordered my usual pick 2, broccoli and cheddar with a tomato mozzarella flatbread. There was a lot of seating but the place was pretty packed. The guy who took our order was super energetic had a great attitude. Even up sold a pastry for 1.40.

This would have been a 4-star rating had it not been for the flatbread I ordered. I ordered the mozzarella and tomato flatbread but it was more like tomato and spinach flatbread. There was a small piece of mozzarella in the middle that I could barely taste. The soup was delicious though I'll probably get a different sandwich next time. 

Service was quick too during lunch and there is always someone coming aroun to clear plates and clean tables."}
{"text":"Have you ever opened a Christmas present to find socks or deodorant? Panera.
From the moment i saw my panini that I spent like $90 on I was immediately depressed and began to ponder my existence and what the meaning of my life was. I shortly after began to contemplate suicide, I will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"The woman that was standing there while we were waiting for our food must of been a server my daughter had a cup of juice that I had ordered for her mind you she's 4 years old she went and accidently spilt it because the cup broke she proceeded to go get a mop and scowled at my daughter and then when I asked Can my daughter get another cup she said have a nice day in a very rude tone. Not impressed. Made my daughter cry... Really she's almost four and has cf... No need for that!"}
{"text":"This is for service as this is my first experience at a Panera...visited this location at 730 AM as it's next to the hotel I was staying at.  Looked up the menu the night before  because I wanted something to eat before my flight out.  Wanted the \"Pick 2\" deal so ordered a panini and a broccoli cheese soup.  Response from cashier was, \"Ee don't have soup right now.\"  Ok, would be nice if u explained why.  I can only assume soup isn't served until later.  Soup nazi?  Lol.  
As for the chipotle chicken panini it tasted good.  Nice amount of spice and still warm when I ate it back in my hotel room."}
{"text":"Always dirty-tables, floors, booths.  So disappointing as this used to be a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Panera is expensive for what you get. This location needs to close down and deep clean the restaurant!!!! The shades are gross, the windows are dirty as well as the floors. The attendants uniforms are stained.
Won't be back."}
{"text":"I came here to have lunch and let me just say that the cashier was not friendly and had an attitude. Also, they serve very poor quantity of food. My broccoli cheddar soup (in a bread bowl) was half way full. Very disappointing since I really like Panera Bread."}
{"text":"I love the food here and I love most Paneras. But the employees here are truly cringe worthy. I don't enjoy listening to a male employee threaten and yell at his female superior because he doesn't want to be at work today while I'm enjoying my salad. Where is the training  and customer service at this location?"}
{"text":"The food was fresh but for the price it was a bit expensive especially for lunch. My husband and I ordered a half sandwich with salad and a drink and we paid roughly around $30 for this. There are a lot more better places to eat in Markham for this price. And considering that it's sort of like a fast food restaurant I understand that the food is geared towards healthy eating but the pricing is just not there. I probably wouldn't come back here to eat regularly because it would cost me an arm and a leg. Overall the food was good still but for the price and portion it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Dirty location. Husband and I will not likely be back. I'd drive farther to have it cleaner. Short blonde haired kid running food and cleaning up coffee and tea area was the only staff member I saw today working on the floor. Many \"kid\" staff walking around, but all food tray bins and trash cans were full of plates and silverware. I was tempted to do it myself after witnessing 5 employees pass by within a 40 minute time frame. Go you blonde haired boy that was running around. My husband and I noticed you and wish that you would get the credit you deserve for your hard work today. That shouldn't go unnoticed in my review of a dirty facility. Food was good, and came out fast. Hoping it was JUST this time. I will review again if I visit again. For not being busy I expected a little more."}
{"text":"So I am here to give a little insight to everyone I used to work at Panera Bread at this location for about three and a half years off and on. This is one of the best locations with the best workers but yes a few of them do you have attitudes. At Panera there are many many many requirements and protocols. With this being said your sandwich is made in a specific order every time. There is no getting around this. Also if you want extra of something you must ask at the register while ordering if we provide extra after you have ordered it messes up our inventory. But if you do not know this rule and and do you ask for extra we will still provide it. We are just simple workers trying to make a living and please remember this is fast food it is not a fancy dine in restaurant ready to cater to your every need. Even though I had coworkers that weren't all that great towards customers but I myself loved many of our customers and would do many ridiculous things to keep them happy. Panera is a good place to work but not an easy place to work so give people a break sometimes"}
{"text":"If I could give them lower then one star, I would! The absolute worst panera!! Stay away from this place! I placed a rapid pickup order, my card was charged, and then they \"closed\" early. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"I'm pretty neutral this time on the food.  The clam chowder should be named potato soup because that's all that was in it.  Sandwich was good but bread was stale and hard and this very much surprised me.  I eat at panera all the time but it's gone down hill recently.  The worst part was the bread bowls were so overdone no one could chew it we dug out the inside and left the bowl which again is not normal for my family they normally clean the whole thing every bit of it.  I have one gripe about the online ordering too if the panera is out of a product then it should stop the customer from ordering it -  it's a complete bummer for people especially kids when things are ordered them you get there and are told it isn't available.  Not sure if we will give them another chance since this is the third time that we have been disappointed.  Probably not but if really disappoints me since this is one of the top 5 places I like to go.  

**so I gave them one more chance and I regret it the young lady that was cleaning and stuff was so apologetic and sweet but it doesn't make up for the poor ridiculously expensive food grilled cheese negative 10 for flavor and it was burnt soup positive 2 cuz it was nice and hot pastries always normally good but hard and stale"}
{"text":"Like others have said, this is just not Paradise Bakery anymore, and I really don't like Panera.

The staff here always mean well, but every single time I call in an order here (usually consisting of two or three sandwiches) the order is wrong when i arrive.  They try to apologize but after ignoring me when I come in the door I am already rubbed the wrong way.  

Is it ok to pick up on the way home to avoid getting fast food?  Sure.  Is it fast? Yes.  But that is about it.  I only pick this up when I am out of ideas and I am always annoyed when I leave.  

And as someone else said, this parking lot is a nightmare.  

I wish the old Paradise Bakery was back, or at least that Panera had let it die with dignity.  What a shame"}
{"text":"Decided to try their breakfast sandwich this morning. I ordered the bacon, egg & cheese on brioche online. I picked up my order and headed to work but something told me to check my food as I was driving so I did. I noticed the egg was over easy which I can not do so I turned around to go back and have it fixed. When I got back I told the cashier I wanted my egg cooked all the way through. She acknowledged she understood and a few minutes later brought my order back out. I get to work, open my sandwich and the egg is over easy. Needless to say I'm pissed and will be making a phone call."}
{"text":"Food delicious!! But the kid menu is terrible is ridiculous, I order fir my daughter a tomatoes soup and was like 2 teaspoon soups, was very very small is literally like spoons of soup , and I pay almost 7 $"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I love Panera...until the last 2 visits.  On 1 occasion; I was starving.  It was late & I ordered the Thai Flat Bread.to go. I tooK it home only to discover it was the Thai salad. All the person. said was \"oh thanks for letting g us know. no apologies.  In A previous visit, I ordered a pbj and  is what I got.  Nor sure how to add a pic. But I took 1 of this terribly made sandwich. Thinking I may not go back. The worst part...it was not busy at all. I was one of just a few, 2 maybe 3 people placing an order."}
{"text":"Classic favorite spot ... I appreciate healthier food ( I.e. Antibiotic free chicken ) it's the little things that count when eating out and it's hard to find good quality these days ..."}
{"text":"Well the tomato soup and sourdough bowl were just fine the bread that came with the sourdough bowl came with no butter and the bear claw was hideous it had risen and it was like a rock can't imagine why you're putting these out and not up to their usual high standard"}
{"text":"They should rename this place, \"please go to kneaders\", because that is what we plan to do in the future.  First, my wife gets sick if she eats mayo so we are always pretty clear about no mayo.  Regardless, her sandwich came out with mayo extreme.  We showed them no mayo on the receipt and the staff rolled their eyes before flashing a fake smile to fix it.  Even when done right, the sandwich was bland and corporate.  Everything there is corporate and uniform as if the bread was made by a machine.  My meal included pasta that was clearly reheated in a microwave.  Yuck.  

Also, this is more expensive than Kneaders or other bread companies in the space.  So I would only eat here if you wanted microwaved pasta, mass produced bread with no texture, and a long wait for expensive food not made as you ordered."}
{"text":"This place could have easily gotten my order right today but they didn't. I work in the plaza and I was there around 7:40 in the morning. There was a couple people sitting and eating and one other person in line with me. The girl at the cash register was quick but had trouble swiping my card but that's my card my card is so old from 2012. 

My order? It was an everything bagel with cream cheese to go. So we all know cream cheese cost more. At panera it is 1.50 more. So i paid for it, reciept said cream cheese. This older lady was trying to help with the order and get it going. Before I knew it she handed me the bag with my bagel and I was happy. I get to work only to open the bag and see there is no cream cheese. WTF. How hard is it to put cream cheese on it. Not only that she just threw my bagel in there no actual wrapping around it. It had a napkin in it to line it and a couple cups of butter. There wasn't even a knife. Like am I supposed to spread it with my fingers?! So I look at the reciept and it said if they make the order wrong they will remake it and give a free treat. 

So I walk back and I tell her I am missing the cream cheese. She was apologetic at least but she didn't remake my bagel (which was cold now btw.) she just went to the fridge and gave me a side of cream cheese...still no knife but luckily my work place has knives. Didn't even offer me a treat, I was going to ask but she immediately went on the to next customer. I was already late for work because of this bagel situation so I just let it go. 

It's a goddamn bagel with cream cheese. How hard is that!? You weren't even busy!"}
{"text":"Very slow. Horrible service. Not staffed properly! I would try to visit another location."}
{"text":"Service here is completely horrible. They constantly mess up your order. For example-NORA. I was there today and clearly stated what I wanted. She gathered the pastries and began to give me my total. I looked in the box and sure enough she had left out multiple items. After that I paid. Then I looked at my receipt and she OVERCHARGED me. I spoke with the assistant manager and he was apologetic and professional. She needs training as does everyone that works those registers. Do not trust them with your order and use Panera Delivered at your own risk!!!"}
{"text":"This location... hmm where do we start?

Well panera have great sandwiches. I visited on a busy sat afternoon and my second bite into my sandwich had a hair. I thought, well at least it's not curly so I showed the cashier and she started to blame me until I said pull on it and then she saw that the hair was baked in the bread. Gross. Hopefully the person did not have the herps! 

The end."}
{"text":"yooooo they forgot my cinnamon roll and cinnamon bagel
i was super sad and disappointed but ima still come back cause i love the food and everyones nice"}
{"text":"For the record - my wife and I have never had bad experience at Panera Bread in the past.  But we will NEVER go back to this location (Rainbow and Warm springs)

We recently visited the Panera Bread on South Rainbow for a casual dinner on a Saturday evening.  We walked in with no special expectation thinking it would be just like any other visit. 
 Unfortunately, we were wrong.

The first negative vibe happened at the cash register.  We noticed the young man there chatting and joking with the customers before us - perfectly normal.  However, once my wife and I stepped up, he gave us a blank stare and failed to utter any sort of basic customer-service greeting to us.  We ignored the silence and said hello and proceeded with placing our order.  He seemed to have some difficulty managing the POS system - not a big deal. Although, none of the 4 employees we observed standing around throughout the restaurant (doing absolutely nothing by the way) were by his side helping him out.  

Once we found a booth, we noticed that a pastry we had ordered had not been given to us at the counter.  We decided to wait for one of the employees to deliver our food, at which point we would ask for the pastry.  After a longer than usual wait (which was interesting because they had more employees than customers, yet we still had to wait a long time for our food), our food was brought out to us and we kindly requested that the pastry be brought out as well.  

The response we received from the employee was, \"Sure, but for future reference, you are supposed to pick up your pastry at the counter.\"  To us, we thought that was unwarranted attitude; as she said it with such annoyance.  We have been to Panera Bread plenty of times before and we knew normally they'd give us pastry at the front counter.   And if it was forgotten, it was never a big deal for any server/runner to bring the forgotten pastry to us at the table.  My wife really did not appreciate the attitude from the server.  If anything, that comment should have been made to the employee manning the front register to remind them to NOT forget to give the customer pastries they've ordered.  That was bad customer service.

After 3-4 minutes, the employee finally returned with our pastry and sourly asked if we needed anything else.  Once we said we were okay, she then proceeded to head over to the kitchen and talk/laugh with other employees for the duration of our stay.

About half way through our meal, while one of the managers was leaning on the counter in the lobby texting on her phone, we heard an argument erupt in the kitchen.  One of the employees was distraught and yelling profanities at what I can only assume was another manager.  The employee removed their uniform and apparently quit on the spot as far as we could tell.  The entire restaurant fell silent briefly and tension filled the air for the rest of the evening.

As I observed the employees from this point on,  all I saw them doing was laughing with each other, texting, and doing absolutely nothing work related. Managers again were observed texting on their phones in the lobby and doing nothing to apologize to customers for the disturbance.

It was also amazing the sheer number employees working at the time versus the amount of customers in the restaurant.  The ratio is wayyyy off.  Whoever did the work schedule certainly did not do their job correctly.  It would also appear that large amount of employees were \"on break\" concurrently and sitting/eating/socializing in the main dining area.  That was strange to us because at other restaurants, if employees were on break and eating, they would normally be sitting away from the customers and behaving in such a way that would not disturb the customers.

I have managed restaurants in the past and I always went to great lengths to ensure that the customer always had a pleasant experience,  and if they did not, I would go out of my way to ensure that they knew I was aware of their situation and that I would do everything I could to rectify the bad experience and encourage them to return in the future.  The management team at this location did no such thing.  It was the most unprofessional dining experience I have ever had and I would be very surprised that any of the current staff will be around much longer if reviews like this keep cropping up."}
{"text":"I generally am a big fan of Panera bread- but this location provided me the worst costumer service experience ever. They were rigid, rude, completely unaccommodating when my 7 yr old asked for a splash of tomato soup on her Mac and cheese.
1st they said their policy didn't allow mixing soups. Then they said, they'd have to charge me for it. Then they said I can't pay anymore because the registers are closed."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the bbq flatbread. The bbq sauce is great with a little bit of a kick at the end, with crispy corn chips and yummy chicken.  The bread is similiar to a pizza crust - very light and flaky.  The tomato basil soup is great.  My Mom had the fuji chicken salad and loved it."}
{"text":"Another consistent Panera location!  The staff was friendly and quick to turnaround orders, the atmosphere is clean and relaxing and the food is always good.  I enjoyed the You Pick 2 with a Greek salad and Chicken Noodle soup with a baguette...it never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Another consistently good Panera location...I have no idea why the reviews are so bad!  The staff was friendly, our food was quick to come up and it was delicious.  This time I enjoyed a ham and swiss egg soufflé with a prickly pear hibiscus agua fresca...perfect way to start the morning!"}
{"text":"Another great Panera location...so glad they finally moved into the Valley!  We have stopped in for their incredible breakfast pastries (cheese danish & chocolate croissant) and have never been disappointed.  I love their hot tea selection too!"}
{"text":"If you're hankering for a bite, STEER CLEAR OF THIS LOCATION.  Look, I enjoy the food and beverages from Panera Bread as much as the next yelper, but this place is DISGUSTING - in all caps and bolded.  period.  [I'm very tempted to bump up my review of the Panera Bread in Markham for the stark difference in presentation and cleanliness.]

Now, let's be real here, it is difficult for most downtown locations with high foot traffic to remain completely spotless..  But when you have a cluster of fruit flies humming around, and ON THE FOOD, that is an issue an establishment ought to seriously address.  

TL;DR; This Panera Bread is ideal for those who like fruit flies on the side of their orders."}
{"text":"Thread cautiously yelper; prepare for a Battle Royale / Hunger Games like competition for booth, and large table seats - oh, and of course power outlets.  (It's worth baring in mind that people LOVE to study at this location, as in 2 - 3 hour sessions.)

The cashiers are friendly, professional, and have a strong product knowledge -- oh, and they up sell like smooth criminals.  (That means experience in my books!)  

Would love to come by more often, if it weren't for the lack of seating."}
{"text":"First time visitor. The portions are ridiculously small for the prices. More than $15 for the signature Chipotle Avocado sandwich, which turned out to be a half sandwich. Expected a lot more and the sandwich tasted like it had been reheated. Turkey chili that it came with was pure salt. The employee who served us forgot the bagel we ordered and then left the place. The receipt claims if order is inaccurate, you'll be given a \"free treat\". Didn't happen."}
{"text":"I wavered between 4 and 5 stars, but the food last night was either REALLY good or I was just REALLY hungry (we'll go with really good food).

Located at the very busy intersection of Hwy 51 (Pineville-Matthews Rd - we like to double name our streets here in Charlotte and then randomly change the name mid-street with no warning) and Carmel Rd, I had previously only stopped at this Panera in the morning for meeting-related treats and they did a fabulous job at that.  Their online ordering system, allowing me to not have to speak to a human, was awesome.  At the time I did the order, I needed the same thing for 3 consecutive days and their system would not allow this, it kept telling me I was doing a duplicate order, but we got that straightened out.  Many bagels and pastries (you can have them pre-slice the bagels for easier serving) put on typical catering trays with a clear plastic lid - everyone very much enjoyed everything and there were only crumbs left each day.  The carryout for the meetings was first class and on time with plates, napkins, utensils and such which kept me from making another stop for these things.  

Last night I stopped for dinner after reading their menu online and seeing their great soup selection and a grilled cheese sandwich with BACON.  Cheese and bacon?  Sign me up!  I did their choose 2 where you can get half of a sandwich and a cup of soup.  You order and are then given a red vibrating buzzer to let you know when your food is ready.

The food: 
Big kid grilled cheese:  Gruyere, Vermont White Cheddar, organic sliced American cheese and Applewood- Smoked Bacon grilled on White Miche. Deeeeeelicious!  Served while the cheese was still gooey and the bread still warm, this was YUM-MY. 
Broccoli and cheddar soup:  Thick and creamy and loaded with broccoli and small pieces of carrot.  Served very hot with a soup spoon (it's the simple things that make me happy).  
Cherry pastry (danish-ish):  So good, so very good.  A flaky pastry with a well filled with a cream cheesy first layer, then topped with cherry filling and then drizzled with a light, white icing.  Deliciously satisfying treat that wasn't over sweet, perfect balance of everything really and served in it's own small pastry box in case I needed to take it to go (I did not...).
Drinks:  Serve yourself Pepsi products.  Bleh.  But they did have tea, root beer and fruit punch.

It's a pickup and bus your own table place with lots of seating.  Booths, tables and chairs and even comfy chairs for those who want to sip and stay a while.  Free wifi that I easily got onto with my Kindle Fire.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Me and my two aunts decided to stop here after visiting the Ben & Jerry's across the street so that we could try it out. The bread was fresh and very delicious, and there are a wide variety of drink options. I was super thirsty while there and could not decide whether I wanted a lemonade or a soda -- I chose lemonade of course. Haha.
Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Screwed up my order twice in 1 week. Didn't do what they said to correct the first time, missing items the second time, and when I called for a refund, I was told some policy of not refunding over the phone....Are you joking, since we inconvenienced you by not bringing your items, we will inconvenience you a second time to get a refund...NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I ordered on line with definite NO Onions, NO dressing, chicken on side, NO feta Cheese.  These workers obviously can't read the simple instructions with the word NO.  I returned my lunch, this isn't the first time they have made my lunch wrong.  Done with this location.  Macedonia is my final hope for a restaurant that should have great service with their fresh food. My suggestion, give your workers a reading test.  CAN YOU SPELL NO?  When I called to complain, and then ended up returning my entire lunch, the worker told me that they were terribly understaffed.  Is that my problem?  Stop taking orders if you can't fill them."}
{"text":"I come here primarily for the bear claws at the bakery. Today was no exception. However, a bit more hungry I ordered the Turkey apple and cheddar sandwich and it was fabulous!!! The cashier forgot to ask my for my phone number but that was the only issue."}
{"text":"I had a terrible online delivery mishap to my job, and to rectify the situation the manager gave the best customer service I have ever witnessed in years!!  Kudos to Keisha for her loyalty to her customers and unmatched customer service!  Thank You!"}
{"text":"I had a great sandwich and soup and a cookie with my wife. It tasted amazing. The price was in line with other places like wildflower and Paradise. The food is many times better than the likes of wildflower and Paradise. Service was polite and fast."}
{"text":"Around 7:30 in the morning stopped in to have breakfast.  Only 3-4 people in restaurant eating no line no crowd nice and quiet just the way I like it. Got some bakery to go and had a steak and egg bagel.  Didn't take long order was hot and probably the BEST breakfast sandwich I've had in a LOOOONNNGGGG time! Service was friendly and all was good."}
{"text":"I know this place just switched over from Paradise Bakery to Panera and there was a physical remodel of the location as well. It seems like logistically this place is still trying to find their groove. My cousins and I all ordered salads and all of them came back dry. No dressing on the side. We had to go ask for them. One didn't get her side, the other had to get a new soup b/c they ran out (which is fine, just another hiccup). I ordered my salad to go and was surprised at how long it took. In my mind to-go means \"i'm in a hurry\". Maybe that's just me though. To their credit, one of the employees brought us a box of a dozen delicious cookies (complimentary) to make up for all the order blunders. I did have a special request for my salad and that was fulfilled. Staff appeared a little overwhelmed at times but were never rude. 

I'd come back again, but not any time soon. I think they need more time to figure out their process."}
{"text":"Don't Even Go

Went through drive thru for a Sierra Turkey sandwich. Get home and there are two slices of turkey, one slice of cheese, and three slices of onion on either half of the sandwich.  That is it! I called to complain, and the manager did not even apologize, and has given me 30 days to claim my free sandwich from only that location.  After being treated extremely rudely last time, the last thing I want to do is go back! Absolutely ridiculous that they would allow an order to go out that way."}
{"text":"The Italian Combo is flawless everytime!  There's so many options on their menu, but I keep going back to the Italian Combo because it's just THAT good.

The Mac & Cheese would be my side of choice.  It will be yours as well once you try it once.

The End."}
{"text":"I have only been to Panera Bread once before and it was the Square One location.  I grabbed a sandwich to go so can't comment much on the experience.

This time I went to the newly opened one at Heartland.  It's a huge location and has a decent sized dining room.  You can buy bread, pastries and also lunch! They serve breakfast till 10am weekdays and 11am on weekends. Everything can be eaten in or taken out.  

Today we decided to grab a sandwich and sit down. It was PACKED and people were walking around holding their lunches trying to find a seat so they could sit down and eat..  Although it was madness in there, the staff seemed to have it under control and food was coming out of the kitchen steadily.  The tuna sandwich was tasty. fresh, great bread. The soup was really nice as well. Served with a piece of a baguette.

Overall because it was pure chaos in there I don't know that I can give it more stars... there was a teenager literally sleeping, head on the table etc.. taking up a booth during the VERY busy lunch hour. No food or anything in front of her. People scrambling to get tables... getting upset at each other.. Not cool. You would think the staff would ask her to move. No one said anything to her. If my bf hadn't scored a table I probably would have said something to her. I didn't think it was cool at all. 

The food is good however, and fresh and the bread is very tasty. I will probably go back in a few months after it's calmed down a bit. I can't handle that much chaos at lunch."}
{"text":"We stopped in about 2:30 on a Thursday afternoon. It wasn't busy.  That said, the staff was super friendly and I was impressed by how clean the restaurant was. Tables clean and glancing at the trash cans, they were clean as well. I'm not a Panera regular so I asked the cashier some questions about the menu and she cheerfully helped us out and made a great recommendation. The food was served hot and was very good. 

I wasn't expecting much from a rest stop restaurant and was pleasantly surprised! There are 3 Panera's on the tollway and we plan on stopping at one on our return trip in a couple days. I hope they are as nice as this one."}
{"text":"The worst Panera I ever visited , very rude manager  she should be fired for rudeness to customers, I never experienced such service, I asked cashier to switch one item she already ringed in the register, she went and ask manager for help , manager came very rude gave me refund of $6 in coins to make her point, and told me to go to bank to change it."}
{"text":"It's your average Panera! Great food and nice employees. 
The only reason i give 4 stars is because the parking is a mess !

Get the turkey chili !! I think it's seasonal (fall/winter), so get it while it lasts !"}
{"text":"This Panera provided me all my favorites.  I stopped in for lunch and worked for a couple hours before my meeting.  My only gripe is that's it's 3:30 in the afternoon and no one has been around once to wipe tables. (over 2 hours) Trust me its not busy and are staff are chatting it up in the back.   My advice...  wipe your table down before you sit....  Food is Great per Panera standards"}
{"text":"Increasing this to 3 stars. I still think their lunch is pricey, but the breakfast combo for 6.99 is great.  You get a choice of specialty coffee (ie any latte or cappuccino) with a breakfast sandwich.  I really enjoy their lattes and their souffles."}
{"text":"Went here with my dad and bro for lunch. It was relatively clean, friendly staff. Ordered the \"you-pick-two.\" (Favorite option) They messed up my order (wrong soup) but decided to give it a try - brought broccoli cheddar instead of black bean. It was good!

Would definitely visit again if in the area."}
{"text":"I order delivery from this Panera Bread about once a week.  There have been a few times that the soup was put in the bag sideways (spilling everywhere) or items have been left out of my order.  The delivery drivers need to start checking ordered before they leave the store and the person packaging the order needs to be better trained.  When I receive my incorrect order all I get in response is...you can call for a free pastry.  That does not fix the fact that my soup is all over the place and I am missing my drink."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Panera bread, I visit 1-2 times a week. However, I'm growing extremely frustrated with this location. I visit this one frequently because it's location is less than 5 minutes from my house and it has a drive-thru. That's about the only reason I keep coming back to this one. Every single time I have come through the drive-thru, I have been given the wrong side, even when I specifically ask for chips NOT yogurt. Every time I am given bread or yogurt and I have to get out of my car and go back inside. It's really inconvenient ESPECIALLY when on my receipt it even notes I asked for chips. Also, about 2/5 times I have ordered Mac and Cheese, I have been able to tell it wasn't freshly made.. Rather it tastes like the kitchen didn't want to toss the old cold stash sitting out so they microwaved it thinking it wouldn't taste different. I wish I could just get the meal I'm paying for here..."}
{"text":"RE: delivery only.  Many folks from our office have ordered delivery, and it began great!  Orders hot, fresh and on time, folks were jealous they didn't get in on the order, and now....the opposite.  When your order is 1 hour and 40 minutes late, the sandwich comes smashed, and barely warm, you have the right to be unhappy.  Of course, a $5 gift card settled things out (yea right).    Another order a day or two later- 1 hour 15 minutes late.  Lukewarm food.  25 minutes late was the next one reported. No apologies from the drivers, either.   To noone's surprise, many coworkers have discontinued ordering, no one is jealous they didn't get in on it; as we are not an office where we sit at our desks all day.  We depend on the estimated time. Like most, give or take 5-10 minutes, but it was getting out of hand."}
{"text":"It's got a nice patio and a few comfy chairs inside. The wifi works ok and it's a big space. I just had a breakfast bagel which had no taste.  It wasn't what I would expect here as in the U.S. the Panera were quite good. They should at least try to use better quality food. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Visited this past weekend for some chicken noodle soup! Great place! Staff are super friendly, they greet you as your coming in, making me feel welcomed! Portions are decent even after i had asked about adding more noodles to the soup as i came the day before there was more soup than the noodles and they were very friendly about adding more for me at no cost!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on the way out of town. This location was large, clean, and the staff friendly. We were immediately greeted and placed our orders. Our food arrived almost immediately (it was breakfast so there was no actual cooking that needed to take place). I ordered a souffle because they are always so good at Panera. I love to get their hazelnut coffee when I visit, which is admittedly quite infrequent. At home I have a plethora of coffee shop options so why would I visit a chain? But, when necessary I do like to choose Panera."}
{"text":"This is a very nice, large open location.  I had the apple chicken salad which had the most delicious light dressing with a pumpkin muffin top - delicious.  My friend had a southwest salad and muffin.  A nice spot in the beautiful Boca Park area."}
{"text":"Disclaimer - I never really go to Panera because I think the food is good. It's usually because I'm craving soup on my lunch break, or a big chocolate chip cookie, or a bowl of that hearty, super healthy mac and cheese. I feel like most of their food is pre-cooked, pre-made, pre-whatevered before they nuke it and slap it on my plate. I was craving a grilled cheese and tomato soup and since this Panera is right by my office I thought \"you can't really screw up a grilled cheese... right?\"

$13 and a barely toasted sandwich later... WRONG. This location gets SUPER busy at lunchtime, so be prepared to wait. I waited about 5 minutes in line, and close to another 10 for my food. At first glance my sandwich looked OK, but when I went to pick it up I immediately noticed it was barely even grilled or panini pressed. I turned the sandwich over and (see photos) the bread wasn't grilled AT ALL. Since I was in a hurry and the line was about 20 people deep, I didn't have the time nor patience to complain and ask for them to make it right. I ate my soft, soggy sandwich, dipping it once or twice in the tomato soup before coming to the realization that Campbell's beats it tenfold. 

Overall an extremely disappointing lunch experience. My expectations are never too high in major chains like this, but when a girl wants a grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup, anything goes. I did tweet a pic of my sad sandwich to Panera in hopes that they take note and either a) try to make it right or b) educate their employees that even when busy, every $13 order is just as important as the next one."}
{"text":"My excuse was that I was sick. For once in my life, I went against the sign... I ordered a soup and salad and didn't get bread... It only has bread in its name.

Had the chicken noodle soup. Way too salty and I couldn't tell the difference between this soup and one I could get from a can... Not even a very good canned soup. 

The roasted turkey harvest. It was suggested since it was back by popular demand. Someone should return it and never bring it back again... It's bag salad with boiled turkey. It wasn't roasted. 

However, other people I know speak highly of this chain and my friends who ordered sandwiches (because they weren't sick and therefore not crazy) said it was good.

Your order also comes with an apple, chips or bread. They gave me an apple... It was an all around fail day for me... In future, there is only one correct response. Bread please. Keep the veggies to the side.

Happy eating."}
{"text":"Panera Bread is one of my favorite restaurants. Unfortunately, during a late lunch on 4/14/18, it dimmed slightly for me at the West Lake Mead location.  My order of caesar salad and tomato soup was quickly, accurately, and courteously taken.   Both items were at the right temperature and flavorful.  The detraction was the surprising number of dirty tables and floor trash. During my 30 minutes there, a worker came by to clear tables but left crumbs on them after wiping them down.  No one swept underneath the tables and booths, which clearly needed attention.  I also noticed a good deal of crumbs on the floor behind the cashier stand. Will I return to this location?  Yes.  Will I ask to speak to the manager if I observe repeat problems?  Yes."}
{"text":"i did go back and had a pumpkin muffin. it was great!! no aftertaste!"}
{"text":"Ordered food to go. Sandwich was not how I ordered it. 
Beau, the manager was arrogant and so unkind in handling the situation... His people seemed tense and uneasy... ATTENTION PEOPLE WORKING WITH FOOD, FOOD IS A BLESSING TO THE BODY TEMPLE, if you do not like yourself or your job, do not work with food! Get help! Learn what it is to be of service to give food and orders with keeping your mouth shut, so to listen what is the problem! 
 Beau, learn to listen, so you do not come off as being a Royal dick! 
GOD EATERIES GET IT TOGETHER!! Put kind people in order to run an establishment where food is good and service is extraordinary! 
The sweet Latin girl who gave me back my Sandwhich I believe Jessica was her name- place someone like this in a leadership roll... You would have a better turn out in repeat customers.

Errrr......"}
{"text":"I would like to begin with the fact that the food did taste very good, but the one star pertains to the service. 

Café number: 202339 
Date and Time of transaction: Aug. 27th, 2017. 5:02:54 P.M. 
Check Number: 121470  

We ordered a chipotle chicken avocado melt, an extra side of macaroni and cheese for myself, and two items for the \"pick 2\" meal deal for my wife.  When taking our order, the cashier (who seemed to be new) did not notify us that one of our items did not qualify for my wife's \"pick 2\" meal, so we were charged full price for an expensive entree when we had communicated that we specifically wanted to do the \"pick 2\" meal deal for her order. We did not notice this problem until we were leaving, but the bigger issue I experienced made me feel unwelcome and unable to bring a complaint to the supervisor. 

When we received our food, I brought it to the table, bit into my chipotle chicken avocado melt, and noticed it was missing avocado. I went back to the service station, and while waiting, I saw a customer complaining that they did not receive their baguette - a side dish that comes with most meals. The two people behind the counter rudely told him off, said that he was a scammer, and told him to leave. I do not know the truth of these assertions, but this was no way to speak about a patron in front of other customers. When the person left, appearing very upset about the situation, I went up with my sandwich and receipt and told them that they had forgotten my avocado. I opened the sandwich for them to show that it was missing avocado, and I asked if they could remake my sandwich. The two persons behind the counter seemed upset about the request and said that they cannot take it back, and kept talking about \"customers\" (as in plural - not the singular customer from before, but multiple customers now) trying to scam free things. I said I was not trying to scam them, but the person nearest the counter sarcastically said they were not talking about me and continued to discuss the issue while gesturing toward me. They then said they would not remake my sandwich but would give me half an avocado. The other person behind the counter cut half of an avocado into two pieces, diced one of the quarters, and gave me both the diced and the not-diced avocado pieces. 

I felt incredibly upset about the situation, and did not want to raise any more of a fuss in person because of being humiliated by these servers. My wife and I finished out meal (we had not eaten in several hours and were very hungry) and left. During the meal, I had looked at the receipt and noticed that we had been charged the full price for one of her entrees. 

Once we left, I called Panera Bread customer services and lodged a complaint. I explained the situation and they told me I would receive a call back in two business days about the ordeal, and I was asked if my call could be used for training purposes because of how serious these problems were. I consented to the training question, yet, I never received a call from the store. I called again today and was not satisfied with the response, which amounted to, \"They are a franchise. I will send the complaint again. Have a nice day.\" I gave them ample opportunity to contact me to discuss the problem, and they failed to make that effort.

Update: I called the store today and spoke to a supervisor. They were very understanding of the situation. They offered to provide us two free meals or coupons, both of which I declined. They seemed to take the problem seriously and said they would address the problems with the manager who was in charge that day, as well as the associates who were on staff. My review still stands as it is an accurate reflection of how I experienced the restaurant, but I may give this establishment another chance in the future."}
{"text":"I came here on a recommendation that the French Onion soup was really good and that the pastries are really delicious as well. Well I must say my friend was right! I did enjoy the french onion soup quite a bit and the caesar salad is not bad either. The food is filling as well even though it looks like it might not be. If you come here you must scoop a Cheese danish, they are my fav! Panera has definitely gained a new fan."}
{"text":"Imagine eating soup out of a bowl and when your done the soup you can eat your bowl. That is exactly what you can do at panera bread. Panera offers a great variety of breads bagels, soups, sandwiches and salads. The food is always made fresh daily. But with freshness comes issues. If you come to this restaurant at night for diner they may be out of the bread or the bagels that you want to eat. Most of the meals come with either an apple or the kettle chips. There is a large variety of drinks available and the service is great for a fast food restaurant. I highly suggest this restaurant as it is a sit down fat food restaurant probably in and out within 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Worst Panera EVER. It deserves negative stars. I walked in and there was not a single employee to be seen. Once someone came out of the back, he wasn't actually an employee that could get food or make espresso drinks. When he got more people out from the back, about 5 people started walking around, but only one person took my order and made everything. The others just stood around while one employee tended to me. Side note: I had ordered online for pick-up and was late to the pick-up time, so the food should have been ready to go.

I finally got my food and drink, the food was mediocre and the drink was wrong. I ordered a cafe mocha with almond milk and it tasted like they forgot to add the mocha sauce to it. The \"barista\" kept having to ask the manager questions on how to make it and what to do.

Which brings me to my last complaint. The manager. He didn't interact with me ONCE. I never received an apology from anyone for the lack of customer service and absence of employees when I walked in. Nor did I receive an apology for not having my online order ready for pick-up when I arrived like it was supposed to be. His employee had picked up a phone call that was for him, he asked who it was, they didn't know, and he rudely said \"well, find out,\" and made them get back on the phone just to ultimately tell the person he \"wasn't available.\" 

This Panera needs a complete restructuring and needs all new staff, or needs to be shut down. I'm pretty sure the only reason they're still in business is because of the area they're in(the busiest intersection in town). I will be going out of my way to a Panera farther away just to get better service and product."}
{"text":"This particular location is busy during lunch hr. It's loud enough that they have a hard time understanding the order. the frontega chicken sandwich is bland could add a little bit of flavor. The creamy tomato soup is good. I love their Mediterranean sandwich which is so flavorful. Their breakfast soufflés are great especially the spinach one. They display the calories and every time I'm surprised at loading so much calories on eating so little."}
{"text":"What I like about Panera is that they evolve well over time, but slowly.  When I compare the Panera of 10 ten years ago, when it was more of a bakery with sandwiches to a more dynamic restaurant now.

There are still the pastries and soup in a loaf but more.  There are a daily selection from a handful (careful...hot!) of great soups.  Soup and salad combos abound.  The \"pick two\" option is very convenient.

And the fresh quality of everything is excellent.  Breads, meats, spreads, soups are all crisp, clean and fresh.  

They have an electronic ordering system where you can order ahead and upon arrival go straight to the pick up counter.  This greatly reduces the ordering line and process which still goes pretty slow.  Slow because there are many choices and if you don't know what you want going in, the temptations are many in making  your decisions.

They have been better at cleaning the tables of those without consideration for others by busing their own china and debris.  The drink area has good selection, but can get backed up as people get ice, then pour, then put lids and lemons in their drinks.

Kitchen puts things together fast and accurately.  They truly do a great job.

If you still think Panera as a coffee and pastry shop, think again and give them a try.  Menu and variety now rule.  And it is a clean place to eat."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Panera bread and have been long-term customers since they have a location in our workplace at CMC-main. We have always known and been accustomed to their importance of customer satisfaction. But unfortunately we had the exact opposite experience at the University Panera bread location. The check-out staff was great, but the manager left us very upset and dissatisfied. They got my order for a breakfast sandwich completely wrong and just sent out a totally different sandwich just assuming it was ok. This location doesn't  make the Mediterranean egg white sandwich anymore. They never asked if they could me something different, they just sent something random out. Secondly, my husband's sandwich came out completely cold! The cheese was hardened and egg felt like it was in an ice bath. When we spoke to the manager, she didn't apologize for their mistakes, but simply just took it away and said she can just give us a refund. She didn't offer to remake our breakfast or offer us anything else to please us. She didn't want to deal with us. So we were provided our refund and left hungry and very disappointed."}
{"text":"Always a great meal from Panera. Love the soup and 1/2 sandwich option.  Always had a great salad from this location as well. Staff blah and not enthusiastic. Multiple kiosks to order without the line makes the whole experience impersonal. 
Blueberry muffins are amazing as well as cranberry orange. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Not coming back. Overpriced garbage. Soup was cold, so I microwaved it myself in the dining area. Sandwich was tasteless and carelessly assembled. $4.69 for half a sandwich that literally I could make at home. Do yourself a favor, go to subway, get a big sandwich the way you want it, and save your kids' college money. Two stars only because WIFI was free and good connection."}
{"text":"Not bad, I tried a few sandwiches from here, and while they are good, they are expensive.
Avoid the chicken, it seems like pre cooked stuff.

Free wifi though"}
{"text":"This Panera is like all the others. I have been several times and have noticed they have trouble keeping Avocados in their menu. I spoke with a team member and she said this was true that they often get avocados that are too green and can not be used. They have nice salads and it is an okay place to get fresh baked items. The only reason I sometimes go here is that is so close to my home."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! It's a great place to study and fill up on  baked goods.... free refills on the coffee! Their food is pretty good too. I had the mozzarella and tomato paninni and the tomato was spectacular. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite location. My cashier (Treyvon) was nice had a great smile was nice to talk with & for the rest of the employees I can't say the same, while I was waiting for my food (for awhile) they didn't look happy at all cursing and walking around with attitudes. I Came in happy and I wasn't happy when I left."}
{"text":"Great staff friendly  too bad they did not get our order correct  then we drove to lake mills to enjoy it only to find out they didn't give us what we ordered and it was a couple of items they missed."}
{"text":"After hearing so many good things about this place, I finally got a chance to go there and I was so disappointed.  The girl who took my order, Natalie. was so busy trying to sell me extras that she didn't listen to what I ordered so when I got my order it was wrong. 

Another girl took my sandwich back and, instead of making me a fresh one, just had them put that same one in the panini press, lettuce and all. When I got it back it looked like it had been practically thrown in the box. 

I went back in and spoke to the manager who was lovely and left without buying anything even though she offered to make another panini for me. Also, two other people came in after me and the girl who served them asked if it was their first time there and when they said it was they got a free pastry! Natalie didn't hook me up like that."}
{"text":"I came to Panera and I ordered the Mac n cheese and I was really disappointed bc the large and the small are the same size and $4 different and when I asked about why I got so little the guy told me that's the size it's supposed to be and he said this with an attitude but overall I'm really disappointed w the service and the amount of food for the price"}
{"text":"I love Panera bread! Placed my order in the kiosk and was handed my food as I finished making my coffee! Coffee is a little on the weak side. By broccoli cheddar soup keeps me coming back! Server was attentive and very nice, will be back."}
{"text":"If I could give them a negative score I would. I ordered delivery and it took the sorry bastards 2 and a half hours to get me my food and didn't even offer to discount my food or refund me for the ridiculous inconvenience. 

THEN when I finally got my damn food 20 freaking years later, it was cold. I hate them and will never order food from them again. Fuck you Panera!"}
{"text":"giving this panera 5 stars because they always spell everyone's name correctly for orders without customers having to dictate the spelling to them. also the food is bomb af"}
{"text":"I really look for the positive in a place before I say anything AND I speak to the management of a place that might be struggling.  If it weren't for the folks behind the counter and the baked goods, this particular Panera would get no stars from me.

Almost every time I visit this store (which is in my place of business), I receive a \"how are we doing survey\".  I complete it honestly and give my contact information.  The last time I actually dined in, I had the opportunity to speak to the manager, but....

My issue is the inconsistency with the food (not the baked goods).  I almost always order a salad, with the occasional sandwich thrown in.  The first time I ordered a salad, I ordered the half size and was shocked at how much I paid for that small bit of salad so I decided to stick with the full size.  The problem is, of the 6-10 salads I have ordered, there was only one occasion when the salad was actually a \"full\"...the other times, it was as though they took a half size and put it in the whole container.  I usually go with a friend and we have similar tastes...the difference in the amount of salad in her box and mine is always drastically difference.  AND there is almost always something missing...I ask for olives...no olives...I ask for gorgonzola...no gorgonzola (or maybe one small chunk of cheese).  

The only food that has been fairly (fairly, not always) is the soup.  They have a hard time messing that up.

As I mentioned, I've given this feedback on the surveys AND in person and I bought my LAST salad there this past week.  I got all the way back to my building and compared my salad with my teammate's...much smaller and two small chunks of gorgonzola cheese.

I'll stick to the bread and sweets.  The people running the cash register are super nice and incredibly helpful.  The folks in the kitchen need a lesson in consistency.  And management needs to listen to (or read) the surveys...contact the people who give the feedback and fix the issues."}
{"text":"Not any better than the Paradise Bakery that was here before. Guaranteed an error during each visit. Even when ordering with the Ziosk the food still comes out wrong. Not sure what the problem is here since that eliminates the human error during ordering."}
{"text":"This is a review I thought I'd never make for a Panera Bread ever, but sadly I will be avoiding this location at all costs, which sucks because it's less than 10 min from my house. I'm an avid Panera customer, as they're one of the few choices that provides healthy eating in a somewhat fast manner. I religiously go to Panera, I would say at minimum 2x a week, some times more than that. Every time I get the same exact meal, Fuji chicken apple salad, chicken noodle soup and Frontega chicken sandwich with no cheese. Every single time I come here they mess up my order. Every single time they put cheese on my sandwich. The first couple of times I didn't care. After it became the standard it began to really annoy me. What's worst is if I don't check before I go home I'm stuck with it. It's never the cashiers fault because I always see the 'no cheese' on my receipt. Today was just the last straw. I mean after seeing me every week, knowing me by name, why is it that you cannot get a simple order correct? A order the is exactly the same every freaking week. And it's the same people working. I use to be offered a beverage or a dessert for the mistake and having to wait longer for it to be fixed, now because it's every visit, they don't even bother trying to compensate the error. Cafe Zupas is also in Boca Park and it's just totally amazing food, similar price but offers much more food plus they make the food right in front of you, little room for errCafe Zupas is closed on Sundays so I reverted back to Panera today and what do you know, they put cheese on my sandwich. I'm just done with this place. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the manager is quite a sweetheart and sincerely apologized for the mistake that occurred just 3 days prior. Plus they donate their leftovers which I believe is admirable. But I'm going to avoid this location in the future."}
{"text":"I usually like Panera Bread.  Perhaps I still do...somewhat.  However, I don't like the experience that I recently had.  I visited there a few days ago and placed my order which consisted of a bowl of turkey chili and half of a chicken walnut sandwich.  Once I received my order I asked the person who accepted my payment at the drive-thru window if they had pickle spears.  She consulted with someone else and acknowledged that they do have them.  She then politely asked me how many I would like.  I stated that I would like two of them.  She searched for a container to put them in.  She had a hard time getting the pickles to remain in the container that she selected.  I saw her use her bare hands to push the pickles down into the container.  Then she handed the container to me.  I was appalled, yet I didn't make a scene and I took the container and drove off.  I could tell that she was new and perhaps unversed on proper etiquette.  I am considering calling the store to report the incident."}
{"text":"Ordered pick two including a Fuji apple chicken salad. The chicken was a frozen block and stuck together. Zero love went into my order. Glad there are other Panera locations that get it right. Won't go near this one again."}
{"text":"It was horrible. Chicken salad sandwich was very salty. They no longer give cookies with a meal. Instead, you get a piece of a baguette. Guy behind the counter used his bare hands to rip a piece off & toss it on the plate. Then he wiped his hands on his pants. I told them to keep it & no one looked surprised."}
{"text":"I ordered the full size power chicken hummus salad and when I got to the cashier I looked at my salad and there was barely any spinach so I asked her if this was a full salad and very rudely said yep and handed me my drink!   Seriously 6 bite size pieces of chicken and a handful of spinach with a scoop of hummus.  Worst salad EVER! For a $10 lunch I cursed the whole way home and hungry!!!"}
{"text":"The staff here is wonderful the food is good especially when looking for a light lunch.
It's usually filled with the trendy or super nerdy. You see the soccer mom that still trying to  hold on. But besides all that the good is good and fresh.  I really enjoy the baked goodies over here. Also got great rewards program"}
{"text":"New location with great service! All the cashiers have been very friendly on both my visits! Food is always made to order- that menu is way to big t even pre make! Ingredients are fresh. They have really good coffee and breakfast treats. I enjoy the sandwiches the most!!! 
Has a drive thru!!! First time I've ever seen that! They also offer delivery! I saw a car one day out driving in warner then today I saw their sign by drive thru. So that's a great option for locals!!"}
{"text":"I would leave them 1 star, but it is Panera after all and the food is delicious. This location is the worst, I swear. The service is awful and the staff always makes you feel like you're irritating them by even being there. My drive thru visit last week consisted of them forgetting two items, which resulted in me having to go inside, which I was trying to avoid in the first place. Then I go inside and was basically accused of lying by the girl who supposedly put my grilled cheese in my bag. There's a reason I don't go there anymore. This is a prime example."}
{"text":"I had a positive experience with my first visit. The turkey sandwich was quite good. Lots of turkey (thick pieces of turkey breast, not luncheon meat slices) and chunks of avocado. I would have preferred that it had been grilled but is was alright."}
{"text":"Good food; mediocre service. When attempting to put together an order to split for two people, I asked the cashier which was better pricing: You Pick Two or individually ordering (for what we wanted). Her response was \"i can put the order in however you'd like.\"  I explained my question was about pricing not order entry. She finally admitted individual item ordering was cheaper but added \"i'm not supposed to point that out to the customer!\" Oh!  Next visit using rewards, cashier only told me about two rewards when I actually had three I could use and one was for free item!  I found out later after updating my account."}
{"text":"I must say, I've been to this location 5+ times and every time I go it is never great... It's always fresh but the flavours aren't always appetizing. The strawberry smoothie tastes sour. I love the bread and the broccoli cheddar soup. I think I'll just stick to the American Panera."}
{"text":"Panera has good food for a chain restaurant. I think their bagels and bread are generally delicious. Go for the Asiago Cheese Bagel with some veggie spread or cream cheese. Their Cinnamon Bagel is good if you're in the mood for something sweet.

I've tried the majority of their sandwiches but my favorites are the Asiago Roast Beef and the Frontega Chicken. They now have Mac and Cheese which is more flavorful than you'd think and worth a try, but I usually prefer their soups.

The biggest problem with Panera, and the reason they are only getting three stars from me, is that their sandwich portions can be ridiculously small. It's supposed to be a half sandwich but far too often it's like a quarter of a sandwich. Even with dainty bites you'll have it finished in about six bites. It's not bad for a light lunch but the price is a bit steep for what you get. The portions do seem to vary depending on who is making the sandwiches. I've had them range from nicely sized to ridiculously small. If they work to standardize these a little better it would be a big help."}
{"text":"Had a great experience with Cassandra, awesome manager! I was completely satisfied with my salad, and she took care of me like I was family. Will definitely be coming back. Made my night!"}
{"text":"I like Panera Bread,  and when I found myself at Homestead with less than an hour to get linner (cross between lunch and dinner) and saw Panera.  Problem solved.  Great!

Since it was about 3:30 on a Friday, the place was fairly empty.  The girl at the counter can only be described as surly.  From the snappish \"Here or to go?  Is that for here or to go?\" (apparently I didn't answer quickly enough for her), to her giving me a child's cup (I later learned it was the size they give when you want a water--I suspect she wanted a drink and used the cup I paid for to use it when she was on break) when I deigned to ask her about getting a cup, it was a miserable experience.

There was a girl halfheartedly putting around a broom/silent butler and wiping off tabletops.  The table I went to was not only dirty but really sticky, like someone dumped a coke on the top of it.  I asked her if she could wipe it off for me.  What I got was an eye roll and a heavy sigh.  I told her \"never mind\", went to the bathroom, wet a couple of Kleenex and did it myself.

By that time my food was up.  I ordered a tuna salad sandwich.  It was good, the bread was fresh, a generous portion of tuna.  

The food I would give a 4, the cleanliness/attentiveness to cleanliness a 2-3, and the service a zero."}
{"text":"Slightly high In price which wouldn't be if the service 33 min and I received my meal the way I ordered it."}
{"text":"Panera Bread Phoenix  has truly disappointed me! I was so excited walking in to the Central ave location but to my chagrin I was met with an extremely long line, terrible customer service and the soggiest Mediterranean Veggie sandwich I have ever seen. Not only was the sandwich soggy, the sandwich wrapper had sauce all over it and the ingredients on the sandwich didn't taste fresh AT ALL!  After a sad attempt to stomach another bite of this sandwich I called Panera to let them know about this situation and NO ONE answered the phone SMH. Needless to say, I will NEVER be returning again!"}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with the entire Panera chain and this one is no different.

Love: their light roast coffee, free refills, $6.99 breakfast combo, two floors, free Wi-Fi, loyalty card with free treat

Hate: their overpriced, over seasoned pick 2 combos and lack of quality ingredients, tiny booths and the fact you sometimes have to walk up the stairs with your coffee and food, which can really result in terrible accidents, but that's my own fault.

Verdict: just like other Panera's, great coffee, sub par food and average ambiance."}
{"text":"Bigger than the one at Square One and nicer, but too noisy. Ample parking. Good coffee break place in you are in the area."}
{"text":"I wish they had not changed this from Paradise Bakery to Panera. I think Panera should migrate the other way to Paradise but Panera is the bigger gorilla so this is the way it is. I have been to this Paradise location hundreds of times. The first time I went into the new Panera I was greeted by \"The Wall\". I thought they had changed the entrances and I had come in a back door. Nope. Welcome to The Wall and the iPads that they apparently want you to order on. I went looking for real people and gave my order to them. The new design does not flow well and feels closed in compared to the old design. There is a bottleneck where the food pick-up point is close to the drink machines. The Wall really closes in the space and makes it feel fast food-ish. I did not get that feeling before. I come to Paradise for the chicken walnut sandwiches and cookies. They still have the chicken walnut but now you get chips instead of a cookie. What?? No cookie?? Push the eject button. I'm outa here. Now this feels like just another sandwich shop to me. You may feel differently but my experience is not the same. I went here this once and now drive past this store to go to Paradise out by the 101 & Northsight or at Tatum & Shea depending on which direction I am heading. I hope those don't get changed to Paneras. Helloooo Panera, bring back all the cookies and maybe I will try it again. Or not. I saw the little rack of cookies in the corner with a few specialty cookies on it and did not even bother to browse. Seriously? Who ever came here without thinking about all the various cookies. KOOOOOOKIES. KOOOOOKIES. I want KOOOOOKIES!! What was Panera thinking?"}
{"text":"I went to visit this Panera today. I got myself an Ancient Grains Chicken Arugula salad and a turkey sandwich (pick 2). I went to eat in my car because I wasnt feeling like sitting inside. I was so hungry I took a bite out of my sandwich and started to eat my salad. All good at the beginning... I got about a quarter way through the salad then I look down and omg what do I see?! A bug wing!!! I'm thinking a dragonfly. So I started freaking out. I began to try to induce vomiting.... Why? Well I may have ingested a part of a bug...so gross. Then I called my husband, which got me thinking I should ask poison control if the bug is safe. I called they said dragonflies are okay to eat...okay so then I called Panera Head Office they took the matter seriously and told me that they will notify the necessary people. Then I decided to go into the Panera itself to complain since Head Office told me to fill out the complaint form. The lady there was ok at the beginning. She got the form and after filling it out I asked her if I will be getting a refund as this is unacceptable. She said ''we will only refund you for the salad since something was wrong with it, but not the sandwich''. My jaw dropped, I told her that I think a wing in their food should be enough to refund me for the whole meal. She had to message the store manager or someone else to authorize the full refund. MAYBE I AM JUST TOO SENSITIVE, IF YOUR FOOD HAS A BUG IN IT AND A HUGE ONE FOR THAT MANNER WHY WOULDN'T YOU ISSUE A FULL REFUND?! I was shocked by the lack of care I received at the location. Not only did they loose my loyalty but none of my friends ever want to go into that location. I will try to post those photos here for everyone to see. Maybe I will save someone from unintentionally consuming bugs. But, if you are into wings and poor customer service your best bet is this location ;)"}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with panera bread tonight. I have had a gift card without an expiration date and I went to use it online tonight. It told me that it could not accept the card. I decided to go into the store to just order in person and I figured that they would be able to use the gift card. The gift card kept reporting at frozen and then declined. The manager told me there was nothing she could do and to call the customer service number. I did so and it gave me the following message: \"we are currently experiencing technical difficulties. Please try again later. Goodbye\" so now I have an unusable gift card."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Panera Bread at their new Boca Park location. I got a sandwich and cookie and it was yummy. The staff is really nice and cute."}
{"text":"I love that their is a Panera in the Grove Road shops. My chiropractor is located here, so if I don't feel like cooking after an appointment, it's nice to have some options available. This location was really speedy when I ordered two take out sandwiches. They were friendly, the location was clean and the service was quick. Our sandwiches were packed well and were very fresh and delicious. I always go for the you pick two- sierra turkey & mac & cheese. So yummy. Definitely not a lot of food, so it's better for lunch- but it's still delicious. This location seems really nice for a lunch spot or an evening hang out. It's pretty spacious. Overall- great experience and I will keep them in mind when I have a Panera craving."}
{"text":"To start off... Panera has gotten rid of the breakfast menu. Unfortunately , the breakfast menu was still up for view inside of the Charlotte Northlake location making my decision for breakfast before work even more difficult.  Ellen, the sales associate, was very rude but in a passive way.  
As I was looking at the menu to decide what I wanted to eat, Ellen interrupted my thought process but loudly stating \"I'll take whoever is ready!\"  Shocked, I looked at her in awe. In my experience to this establishment and any other fast food shop, I have never felt like I'm being rushed. This time was different.  
Ellen was an elderly woman and looked like she might have one or two grandchildren. She stood with a grin as I apologized confusingly for taking my time browsing the menu. I saw there was one potential customer behind me in line also browsing the breakfast menu, so I decided to make a quick resolution. 
I wanted to order a breakfast Asiago bacon, egg and cheese on a toasted Asiago bread, a sandwich I have previously ordered. Ellen, my helper, informed me with a smug grin across her face, that they no longer served breakfast. To my amazement, after observing the loud and proud Breakfast Menu, I was yet again bewildered about my food. 
So I then settled for a toasted croissant with butter, another item I've purchased previously. After a short pause, Ellen informed me that they will not toast the croissant because it will in turn ignite on fire. I was thrown back. I have never received so many denials in all the times I've dined from Panera Bread. I've never NOT gotten what I wanted from a Panera Bread in the duration I have been a customer. And I have never been treated so rudely by an employee of any Panera Bread in my current city. 
In fear of writing excessively and over stepping my point, I will conclude my complaint of a recent experience at the Charlotte North Carolina Northlake Panera Bread with the last straw and perhaps the result of my lack of ever returning to this location again. 
After not being told that I received a free pastry due to it being my birthday, I had to apprise Ellen that it was a valid coupon for me to use. I then began to search for a suitable birthday dessert and chose a giant cinnamon roll. I asked nicely if I could get that pastry warmed up.  Ellen proceeded to instruct me that there was a microwave right behind me. Again another experience I never had at a Panera. Someone refusing to heat a pastry up for me. More work for me to handle when I came there expecting a pleasurable time. After microwaving my giant cinnamon roll I noticed that my pastry was thrown into the bag with no napkins and ended up upside down resulting in the icing to get stuck on the brown paper bag. In order to enjoy my free pastry, I had to rip the bag open to avoid getting the excess icing on my hands as I didn't want to have sticky fingers before I head into work. 
I was shocked and appalled at the horrible service I received from this establishment and I surely will not be returning anytime soon and will pass this story on to my many acquaintances and advice them to avoid experiencing a unpleasant visit like I had.  
Yours Truly, 
Morgan Greene Esq."}
{"text":"I love Panera. I always have, and I always will. However, this location is sub-par. I would go to the one on Lake Mead instead.

Parking can be a nightmare. My suggestion is to park towards the Chase bank or take the valet parking before it gets shut down in early afternoon. 

This location is always busy with the line being out the door and slow service. Be prepared to wait or do rapid pick-up. 

My favorite is the autumn squash soup! Get it when it is out."}
{"text":"The sandwich I ordered looked like it was thrown together, very sloppy and when I picked up a half to eat the innards fell out all over my plate. It was poorly put together with no thought or care. The bread had finger imprints from when they smushed the sandwich together. I'm never coming back to this location again. 

Also I ordered a whole sandwich, and at other Panera locations I was given a cookie but this location said it only comes with when you get a drink."}
{"text":"I went in to get some cupcakes but there were flies sitting all over the cakes and scones ... I lost my appetite and left the place. They should at least have a plastic cover for all of the pastries like Atlanta Bread. It was disgusting... Sanitary issueeeee"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect as chains usually suck, but I was pleasantly surprised.

had a ham sandwich, which was tasty and found the staff super nice, almost weirdly as most chain resto's have staff that look ready to murder you.

anyways, coool

I've been back a few times and good experiences every time."}
{"text":"Stopped in on May 15th, it was rather busy but still seating available. We were waited on almost immediately,  I had not even decided what I wanted yet! I ordered a take 2... we were given a pager and told to place it on our table and the food will be brought out to us. We got our drinks and picked a table.. within 5 minutes our food was at our table with a smile!   The French onion soup is delicious! My Panini sandwich was very hot and delicious! I LOVE the acai berry tea!"}
{"text":"GREAT COMMERCIALS, TERRIBLE COLD FOOD AND AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE
  

Panera Bread Co. has the best ads, boasting of non GMO, healthy food. However, it is all ruse...this is my experience: I stopped at Panera Bread for a quick breakfast and ordered a cappuccino and the ham & swiss souffle. I paid and was given a receipt. Shortly after being seated, a employee came out with the cappuccino. When asked where the soufflé was, I was told the cashier was supposed to give it to me. I then returned to the front to request the soufflé and it was given to me. I noted that the soufflé was cold and asked that it be warmed. Alicia, the cashier, told me there was a microwave under the coffee stand and that I could heat it up myself. I advised I did not want to heat my food in a microwave and requested a refund. Alicia then went to get the manager, Crystal. Crystal came to the front with the attitude of a pissed off truck driver, never addressed me and then loudly said 8-10 days. I asked \"what will happen in 8-10 days\" and was told by Crystal that I will get my refund in 8-10 days. (no one offered an alternative meal or apologized for the cold food) I then asked Crystal where the corporate office was for Panera Bread and she said, \"I don't know, somewhere in California.\" I immediately used my smart phone to look up the corporate office and found it was in St Louis, Mo. Soooo...although Panera Bread has great advertising that is where it stops, the food was cold, the customer service was a step down from a truck stop, and the employees are idiots. In a word, eat here at your own risk."}
{"text":"Food was good and came in a timely fashion. This place is super hit. Too bad for he high speed Internet doesn't work. I got the Turkey and avocado BLT and the broccoli cheddar soup. Can't complain. Everything was as it should be. Probably will come again, even though this place isn't that cheap."}
{"text":"First time here today. Cashier was so fast with her script I had to ask her to repeated again and then still couldn't understand her so she said nevermind.  Food wasn't worth the price. Soup tasted like it was from a can and the sandwich slapped together without care."}
{"text":"Smaller selection than the store in Hudson, and less seating, but really friendly staff.  Good selection of pastry and bread at 7:30 am on a Sunday when the rest of town is still asleep. 

Cafe Mocha may be $4 but it's a wonderful hot chocolate with a shot of espresso that isn't too sweet or bitter. I love that by having my Panera card swiped they already have my name on my coffee order."}
{"text":"I dropped by to pick up 2 bakers dozen of the bagels for a breakfast event.  They have a great selection and they were fresh!  I tried to pumpkin pie bagel (the crunchy topping was like candy) and asiago cheese bagel (get it warm) - both were delicious.  I checked out the menu but didn't have time to stay and eat but I will definitely add it to my rotation for breakfast or even a quick bite.  Great service from the girl who served me and packed up all my bagels."}
{"text":"I Really wish I could give this location 0 stars!!! The store manager is seriously the Worst! He's Chubby man with a disgusting attitude! He couldn't do anything for us when We complained about the cheese on our sandwich, he overcharged us instead!  As manager you supposed to try to make your costumer happy but instead he ruined my meal and my day ! I'll never come back to this location ! Oh and wait District manager didn't even care when we filed a complaint about the Chubby! WHAT A JOKE! Panera YOU suck!"}
{"text":"Food... meh
Service... meh

I used to come to this location when it was a Paradise Bakery and although back then it felt like chaos most of the time, I still felt good leaving satisfied with the food and service.   

This visit left me wanting more but regretting not going to one of the many other options in their area.  It was okay.  Normally, your food looks presentable but it was just a Chicken Caesar salad and a New England Clam Chowder soup and a tea.  It was just $12 - I remember how excited I used to get to have my chocolate chip cookie included with my \"You Pick Two\" options... but no more cookies.  I was offered bread, chips, or a fruit; so it's okay I guess.  Most of the traffic areas were dirty, sticky, and out of lids for specific sizes.  

The person bringing out the food to the tables seemed to be the Manager.  He was very nice to us but I wondered if he was going from table to table bringing the food out, why he couldn't see the empty tables that had no plates or anything on them but were still dirty.  Nobody was wiping them down.  

I won't say I won't be back because I have enjoyed their food in the past.  I just hope this was just tired staff, getting to the end of the day (you know, when they're more concerned with cleaning up to leave on time) and not an understaffed team."}
{"text":"Get food great service employees really make you feel welcome. Try the steak and egg sandwich it is delicious"}
{"text":"Not only did it take FOREVER to get our food, the staff was rude and playing around like they were on a break while in the dining area. Two young employees with earbuds in chasing each other around the restaurant joking about how they \"shouldn't have gotten hired together.\" I'll say. Not to mention the profanity they were dropping around the dining area. There was still an hour and a half to lose and the staff was acting like they had already closed. Ridiculous. Won't go back to this location."}
{"text":"There are worse chains and worse fast food joints than Panera.  But I'm not a big fan.  This is a particularly large franchise.  Fairly busy, and has an unfriendly atmosphere.  The can't give a s&%! attitude of the staff contributes to this problem.  They seem pretty unhappy, suggesting either that it's a poor work environment, or they hire or train badly.  

They botched my order, acted like this was my problem, and more or less threw the bag at me when it came up the 2nd time.  I'm giving them 2 stars rather than 1 because the reincarnation of my order actually tasted alright, though I had to rush to eat it because it was so late in arriving.

Bottom line - if you have mediocre food to start with, good service is pretty much mandatory.  This joint needs to get its act together."}
{"text":"My lady and I had always really enjoyed Paradise bakery before they started the switch over to Panera. The food was always good and you get a free cookie! Since they switched, we have been going to this Panera and to be frank it's terrible. 

When it first opened I swear it was not that bad, albeit expensive, the food and service kept us coming back. However the past four or five times we have gone the food was awful. The sandwiches are way smaller than they used to be and commonly have very little ingredients on them. For how expensive their food is I would hope for more. I got a grilled cheese and the bread was rock hard and the cheese looked and tasted like it had been melted on it months ago. 

In addition, this is one of few places I have to double check my bag when I order to-go because they never get my order correct! Not just a roll or something minor but entire sandwiches before. Stop offering me free cookies when I have to come back and just get my order correct!

I'm sorry but three strikes and you're out with me. I will go the extra few miles to go back to Paradise. I wish Panera had never taken them over. If you are in the area and want a soup and sandwich go to Pot Belly. Way better food, without all the grief."}
{"text":"You would think a Panera would be the same anywhere you go, but that's not really the case here. 

I have gone to this place thousands of times (maybe not that much) and the food is fine, but the service definitely could be better. I have had my order messed up or never made a few times, and that kinda bugs me. Sometimes I feel like the workers are more interested in talking to each other about their personal lives, rather than speeding up the process for the customer...

Maybe it is just me, but the free WIFI never works, which is a bummer because this place has 2 stories of tables just primed for studying students."}
{"text":"I LOVE PANERA!!! I went there for my first time and it was a great experience for me and my family !!!:) There was this new girl, her name is Abby,she is very beautiful, and she was trained very good by her employees. I ate at the one table in the back, next to that one window facing the street, and it was very pleasing for my and my adorable husband. Their food is TO DIE FOR! Also everything is amazing especially their ice"}
{"text":"Good food but doesn't serve Soups until 11 on Sunday which defeats the purpose of having soups in the morning when it's cold. Instead have a hot soup during the afternoon when the Az sun starts to heat up smh"}
{"text":"Went to split a sandwich with my wife during a shopping trip.  When our Turkey bravo was delivered the paper from the turkey lunchmeat was still connected to the meat, conveniently tucked into the center of the sandwich.  When I took the sandwich back to the counter, apparently they thought their job was done, because it just sat in the window until I came back up to get it.  When I took it back to our table, they obviously just peeled the paper off the sandwich.  Thanks, that is going a lot farther than I could have done.

Come on, Panera!  At least pretend to show some remorse when you screw up your product."}
{"text":"This is the worst Panera in the area, maybe the worst I have ever been to.

For an example of the incompetence of the staff, here is my last visit.

My wife and I go in to use the remaining balance of a couple gift cards.  We have a couple dollars / change on two cards, then I attempted to pay off the balance with a fresh $25 gift card.  The young lady cashier was having a hard time scanning the card and was obviously getting flustered that the machine wasn't working.  After awkwardly stating \"I hate this machine, it does this all the time\" she looks up at us and says \"OK, you are all set\".  I ask how much is left on my card and am dumbfounded to hear \"none, it had the exact amount.\"  So apparently my new $25 gift card had EXACTLY $14.97 on it.  I really didn't push it because it wasn't that big of a deal, but later that evening I started to feel like I was robbed.

So after the payment fiasco, my wife and I move down the line to where the food if finished.  We stand by the window and hear the employee shout out \"Sue!\" once.  Look around, then set the bag down.  I am a male, with fairly common name, so I obviously didn't think it was mine, so we continue to stand and wait by the window for our order.  It wasn't until I started watching the employees who weren't doing anything that I started to wonder.  I looked at my receipt and see that the name given to me by the above mentioned cashier was apparently \"Sue\".  I ask the employee making the sandwiches if it was mine and why the name I gave wasn't used.  Her response \"Yes, you should have picked this up 15 minutes ago\".  No apology, nothing to insinuate that they could have done something to correct it.  Just a snarky attitude.

I won't be back and I don't understand why others go.  There are so many options that are better quality, cheaper, and even both!"}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday Dec. 17 @11am. No BAGELS!!! What the heck?? I worked at a Panera in Mentor  years ago and never ran out of bagels in the a.m. The girl was rude too!! Horrible management!!"}
{"text":"I feel like this review could be summed up in 2 words. Good/overpriced. 

I feel like I could end this review there but I'll elaborate a bit more. I have never had a bad meal from Panera. I love the fresh baked goods, the sandwiches and the soups put it over the top. I also enjoy the drink selection. My favorite is serve yourself iced coffee with 2 sugars and half and half. I could drink this all day. The acia berry tea is also very good. I still want to try the broth bowels but I have heard good things. 

Now the negative. I feel that the prices are pretty high. It's a glorified sandwich shop. I get that all the ingredients are suppose to be fresh but it's a sandwich. Why does it cost $8!?!? That said I'll still be back. If not for the food for the serve yourself iced coffee a muffin and a good book."}
{"text":"Not sure why so much negative feedback on this place?   I've eaten here probably 50 times and never had a bad experience yet.  There are simply some haters out there.  I live this place!  I definitely give this place a 5-star rating.  These guys have always been super friendly to my girlfriend and I!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service from a very busy Panera Bread. I forgot to order my drink through the self order kiosk. When they noticed I forgot a drink, they brought one out for me Free of charge. Plus I only waited 5 min for my food to come out. Best Panera I've been to. Kudos to team that works there."}
{"text":"Didn't realize changing from Paradise Bakery to Panera mentioned the cost would increase, the food quality would decrease and they'd nickel and dime you for any add on. 30$ for my order, then realized they didn't come with a cookie, had to order those separate.  Not to mention the bagettes for the salads were just chucked in the bad , unwrapped disgusting.  
I mentioned how I missed Paradise Bakery,  and the girl who rang me up...said \"me too, I already gave my notice\" that is all I needed to hear. Definitely will be looking for a different salad stop."}
{"text":"Very disapointed.  Salad was bland and girl behind the counter seemed bothered to be there. 
Won't go back"}
{"text":"I have always loved Panera Bread for many reasons: the great variety and changing seasonal menu that takes them beyond a breakfast in-and-out dash, the atmosphere that is simply so conducive to group project work, finishing class assignments or just hanging out and gabbing for our with my best friend.

The location at Bakery Square is no different. Conveniently large space located amidst the trendy and expanding Bakery Square, attached to the Spring Hills Hotel it is a great place to grab a coffee or bagel. 

The decor standard, there are adequate amounts of tables and booths depending on the size of your party, however only few of the booths in the back are besotted with electrical outlets. [they don't want you hanging out here all day every day after all]. The service is quick and friendly. The menu is a little overwhelming for me personally and ever changing. Sometimes for the better [Pasta dishes] sometimes for the worst [what happened to my favorite Chicken BBQ and Chipotle Salad!!!!]

I especially love their involvement in the community donating some of their proceeds to various causes such as Breast Cancer Awareness Month with the Ribbon Bagel or the Annual Puppy Walk in the Summer time.

Make sure to swipe your MyPanera card for different rewards and keep coming back."}
{"text":"Didn't have the full menu Ava. Somewhat rude staff. Bread for sandwich and the side for a pick 2 was hard as a rock."}
{"text":"The wall to ceiling windows are so wonderful. Granted, the view is limited -- plenty of buildings and cars whisking by -- but there is a lovely little park nearby. With comfortable seating inside and ample seating outside, it is a nice spot to grab a snack or full lunch. Breakfast sandwiches are served until 10:30 a.m. 

There is nothing to rave about -- it's a standard chain cafe. But free WIFI, which is wonderful. I tried the broccoli and cheddar soup and was sad to see clumps of un-melted cheddar in the soup. And it was just warm, not hot. 

I also ordered a BLT. There is no BLT on the menu, but the staff was pleased to make one for me, which I very much appreciated. Thus, it's hard to confess that the sandwich just was not that good. At all. The bacon also was slightly cooled and the one little piece of lettuce sat looking so sad. The whole grain bread was fantastic, though!"}
{"text":"If you come here in the afternoon, it's your average Panera. But if you come for dinner or later, they will probably be out of everything. They must not be very good at prepping. Since every time I've come to this location past around 7PM, they are out of baguettes. And they have never substituted it with something comparable."}
{"text":"My daughter ate thete on Dec 27th 2017 got severe foid poisoning. She had the salad w chicken,eggs, ect. Abdominal pain, 101 temp
Vomiting.  W/in an hr or two eating there. Lasted 1 and half days."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here today. The young guy at the counter (Zack) was very pleasant and went out of his way to find the right bread for my meal. He didn't rush us and we were so impressed with him!  The food is as alway good. Nice spot to relax and enjoy"}
{"text":"I love Panera bread. I was happy to find near my hotel where I started. The food is great as usual. It's consistent and fresh. I can't complain about it. But down side, I didn't know that customer supposed to warm our own food. Long line with only one microwave in small place, bumping each other to get our food over utensils station. They put brown napkins under pastry, after warm up .. guess what?......
I had to remove napkin pieces one by one every single bite, no joke!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was so bad. They didn't even know how to make a ham sandwich. Poor customer service. It also took 10 years to get my sandwich. No one looked like they knew what to do. Would not go again. When I finally got my sandwich, (which they had to remake) there was only one measly piece of ham on it."}
{"text":"I wanted to have a light lunch and decided on the tuna sandwich and greek salad of the smaller portioned pick 2 type.

The tuna salad was a paste! I was shocked as it looked and texture wise tasted like a mushed up tuna oatmeal. WTH? So disappointed. The greek salad was fine except they skimped big time on the feta which makes this salad distinctive.

The iced tea both sweetened and unsweetened were excellent.

I will not be returning to this Panera location.

PROS
Same menu items consistent at any Panera with the same results
Iced tea was fresh and good quality

CONS
No place to sit
Staff is slow"}
{"text":"Tryed Panera for the first time tonight, not totally happy. Mostly I'm not happy about paying $10 for a sandwich and apple, and my apple looking obviously old. Soft spots and a hole= dead giveaway :/ My sandwich being yummy, and the decent customer service, is the reason they get three stars."}
{"text":"I went to this location at 5pm on a Monday with my husband and 3 kids. It was pretty dead inside, yet all of the booths were dirty, the floor was disgusting, and there were 5 employees not doing anything. When I got my salad, they left off the chicken. I waited in line to tell them and they just gave me some chicken in a bowl without acknowledging they had made a mistake or offering me a treat like the receipt said. I will never be returning to this location, it was not worth the $40 we spent. The kids meals don't even come with a drink. Poor service and it made me feel like the food was gross because of the dirty environment we had to eat in. I wish I would give zero stars."}
{"text":"The cashier this morning was very rude and not personable at all she shouldn't be in a business dealing with customers"}
{"text":"My wife and I just stopped in for lunch. Pretty good crowd around 11:30 AM. They have six self ordering stations. Just walk up to the kiosk and it's touchscreen and place your order. The kiosk doesn't  except Apple Pay but the check out in the front does.  For lunch I like going with the pick two. You pick two of a a half salad, half soup, half sandwich, or a flatbread.  I ordered the Caesar chicken salad and the chicken ham and Swiss flatbread. I also like on the kiosk where you can customize and add or take off ingredients from your order. We sat outside on this nice day, and waited about five minutes for order to come. The lady brought our food and she was real nice and asked if we needed anything. She even went to refill my water for me. The food was excellent.  Not sure why all the negative reviews but I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I bought a loaf of the sour dough bread.  It is very good!  The sales clerk \"London\" gave me three slices of their multi grain rye as well which also rocks!  The restaurant was quite busy with lunch patrons.  I will be back to buy more bread!"}
{"text":"Ate here last week. Worst Panera Bread I have ever been in anywhere in the USA. Large house flies crawling all over the food sitting at the pick up window. Dirty tables, floors, and windows, YUK!! Know one seemed to care or even blinked an eye. I will never come back here again. Ill stick to the Brunswick and Strongsville locations."}
{"text":"I had a very pleasant experience at this location. I stopped in for to place a to go order. The restaurant was clean and looked nice. I was greeted by a very polite professional young lady. She helped me with my order. My order was correct and ready in a timely manner. I will definitely consider returning here."}
{"text":"Dropped by this place for my first Panera experience after having heard good things from people who have lived out East for longer. It wasn't disappointing. We aquired a breakfast sandwich and latte each, and it was great. The lattes were large (and had an \"old-school flavour\" to them, according to my boyfriend) and the breakfast bagels were filling and really, really cheesy. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I have been to two locations 4-5 times in a row around 10-10:30AM.  Each time they are already out of sesame bagels.  One location I was stuck in the drive thru and had to wait for everyone in front of me to get their food so I could go home.  You would think they would have given out a cup of coffee for my inconvenience.  When I wrote to corporate all I got was a canned response that did not address my concerns.  They want you to order the night before, but how do you know you are going to have a taste for a bagel the next day?  Maybe I'll want pancakes.  No doubt the executives who have a personal chef at home have no idea how the rest of us live."}
{"text":"They went above and beyond for me! I order the Fuji apple chicken salad and didn't realize it had a cheese on it I didn't like and they remade it for me with no problem and brought it right to me fast. The three people I came into contact with we're all super friendly! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I did an online order and I ordered a romaine and kale Caesar salad WITH CHICKEN. And what do I get a salad with NO CHICKEN! And this is my first time here!"}
{"text":"Food was ok but customer service was awful. I ordered a chicken caesar salad and received a sandwich. I went back and asked for the salad and I was given attitude from the person handling food and the cook. On top of that, the cook kept saying \"no\" that the order she gave me was right. It was an honest mistake but I just didn't appreciate being treated so badly & unprofessionally. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is a great location for food or just a coffee stop. The people are very nice. As for the food, it's average. I get a salad and the portions are always different. There's a patio in the back but it's scary because of foot traffic. I once packed up my computer and went inside because of a scary guy who stopped to sit. It's a usual hangout for me... And I just wished it was managed better."}
{"text":"From 1/6/16
Came into Panera for some lunch. This location is a decent size, and the selection is what you would expect from a Panera. I ordered a steak and cheddar panini that was little bloody, did not expect my sandwich to bleed, but it was still delicious"}
{"text":"Ordered on-line so there was not a way to get a cup for water. Went to the counter to ask for one, had 5 different employees make eye contact and walk away. Not we will be with you in a moment , can I help you, someone will be with you, nothing just turn and walk away."}
{"text":"I just left this location for lunch and waited in the drive thru for 20 mins. I ordered the Green Goddess salad (whole) just opened the bag and they gave me (half) 

Thanks Panera Bread for ripping me off! 

This is the second time I've been to this location and had poor service! I will NOT go back!!"}
{"text":"I would love to say that I'm so happy to see Panera supporting a youth chess tournament HOWEVER, seems that the management here would rather tell other guests that the chess tournament is more of a nuisance....I overheard management tell two old bitter couples that \"well you know they called a week ago to ask if it was ok and I mean I didn't expect them to claim so many tables and put people out\"....as far as I can tell by that comment, the manager DID know and DID tell them that it would be okay....but the instant you get bitter people you back track on your support...I feel bad for these parents who are attempting to encourage their youth to participate in an intellectual game and yet have no realization that at the same time management here would rather bash them with retired folk who are angry just because they couldn't sit at their \"usual\" table (not to mention it's not busy at all right now in the restaurant with at least 15 open tables to sit at)....though the food is yummy I just don't feel like I'll be supporting this business location anymore seeing as though they supposedly pride themselves on being community based and yet the instant an opportunity arises they don't have any backbone to support that community."}
{"text":"Good Panera location. Food is usually made pretty quickly. Cashiers aren't always very knowledgeable about the food."}
{"text":"Tonight I received one of the best customer service ever. The gentleman was so informative, patient and help is in every way he could. I couldn't make decision on which soup to get as I love all of them!!!

 He brought me a sample of all the soups he had available, gave me information about each and helped me pick one. I ended up having the corn chowder soup and the cheddar broccoli soup and a rhubarb pic. 

He also brought me an extra butter cookie on the house since they were about to close. I felt it was very sweet and thoughtful of him.

Both soups were delicious, warm and fresh. Rhubarb pie was more like a coffee cake and the buyer coke was absolutely delicious. I also love their soup dough bread bowl with my soup.

Thank you so much for your amazing customer service right. I definitely will not forget."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite locations to visit. Plenty of parking spaces. Plenty of seating inside and outside. Options to order take out, online, dine in and a tablet option to order as well. The customer service is always excellent. The ladies are always helpful if you have questions about their menu. My favorite summer seasonal salad is the strawberry poppyseed salad. If you haven't tried it, I would recommend ordering it with an iced tea."}
{"text":"I wish I could manage this Panera. It's just not up to par - today 3 dirty booths and nowhere to sit. Too many teens working with no supervision :( / food - good."}
{"text":"I'm sad for Panera. When I went to college in the late 90's Panera was the place to be. It was cool, clean, had free WIFI and had great food. I wrote many-a-essays on Panera and their success, great food and top-of-the-line service. I can say with confidence and honest sadness, Panera is no longer what it use to be and there are too many other great options out there. I have visited Panera for the last time. At The District, the booths are so old you plop down and truly almost injure your tailbone because the pads in the seat (specifically the 2nd booth from the bathroom area, but they are all probably the same as they are worn, torn and ugly) are virtually gone. The booths are so worn out, so old, so lacking padding, so hard, so broken. The bakery cabinet was 2/3 empty when I visited and the young many assisting me said they only fill it once a day, in the morning. So nice, these pastries have been there all day, want one? This location is also inundated with tweens. There must have been thirty 12 year olds with skateboards all over the District and inside Panera. They were yelling, cussing, skateboarding - I mean come on I'm not a \"get off my lawn\" type of person but where are their parents? Where is security? Is this beautiful Green Valley Shopping District turning into a playground for the local middle school? I was very disappointed with Panera and the District on this visit. I don't have any reason to ever go back."}
{"text":"I love Panera, especially their sprouted grain bagel and french bistro onion soup. 

The servers are super friendly, the food is fresh and very tasty and excellent value for money you spend, especially the pick 2 combinations. 

But be aware: this place gets packed during lunch hours."}
{"text":"I love me some Panera and so greatly appreciate their fresh, clean food offerings. This was my first visit to this location. It was incredibly busy which I understand, but it seemed very poorly staffed. It took nearly 20 minutes for our food to come out. Additionally, I think they raised their prices considerably. I ordered a full salad and small drink and it was just shy of $15... eeekkkkk."}
{"text":"We were so pleased to see them arrive close to our house!! Always enjoy lunch and dinner items for years! This morning we didn't want to wait in line for Starbucks so we tried your new drive through out. So upset...triple espresso overflowing out of tiniest cup ever, it spilled in my car.  Wasn't offered sugar either. Two sandwiches #1 steak was  all fat couldn't even bite through and it looked grey and  nothing else really  on the bread. So my daughter and I had to spit out . #2 egg white avacado,  it was okay but then when I bit in to something hard, an avocado stem tip,  I started gagging too.  Really bad quality and poor attention to detail.  Yuck,  really sad my first time at this new location and I probably won't be able to go back.  I always thought your company had really great customer service but maybe your growing to fast in Vegas? Tried to send them comments and website to much of a pain to get through process so yelp it is"}
{"text":"Walked in and got greeted immediately with a friendly smile plus no line that's a extra bonus. Bagels are freshly baked and delicious."}
{"text":"I always feel like I've eaten a healthy meal when I walk out. Feels good! I went in today with my teen daughter. We love this place. Food is great, staff is quick and always very nice. I love that the food changes so I always have something interesting to eat. The restaurant is clean. BUT.... the women's bathroom is always filthy. Minus one star for the bathroom. I paid $30 for us to eat. I'm sure they can afford a deep clean and some paint."}
{"text":"Was at the food court at Chandler mall and had the Cali turkey. Everything OK with the sandwich except the BACON. 2 small strips of cold hard meat. I was expecting more flavorful product, more freshly cooked for the money. 
The sandwich came with choice of soup and I had a bowl of french onion that we more like salty onion gravy with litttle cheese and  coutons. I have 10X  better soup at Applebees or Sweet tomatoes. My ice coffee was just a cup of coffee over ice. 
I will not eat there again."}
{"text":"Panera has the best coffee ever. Hazelnut coffee, that is. For that, I have to give them credit. 

For the way their restaurant handled the homeless guy the day I was there, I have to say... stay away from this place. I sit down at an extremely dirty table. It was the only option I had since I was limited to the plug on the wall. A guy at the table next to me even offered me a napkin so I didn't have to put my laptop on the gross table.

Across from me sat a man, asleep, hand in a bag of chips that weren't from Panera, and water bottle full of who knows what on his table. He would occasionally wake up, disturb the people all around him by yelling gibberish, eat a chip and fall asleep while chewing. He even got up, filled his water bottle with a fountain drink, shook it up and yelled \"pop\" across the restaurant as the top of his water bottle goes flying and pop comes spewing out. 

What gets me is... the employee working came over and had a conversation with him. Never once asked him to leave or anything. Just a BS conversation.

Panera! Raise your standards! Your customers were annoyed by this dude and the fountain drink machine is... eww. If you want to be a little higher in price and come off as a classier place, you need to be classier and take care of situations like this. Panera on Shadyside... no thanks!"}
{"text":"Why do I keep coming back to this over priced establishment? Three words...CHEDDAR BROCCOLI  SOUP. 

I'm not a particular fan of this location. The parking lot is horrendous. The employees aren't that friendly. The cashier I encountered was just there, no smile, no personality. And she seemed annoyed that I was struggling to put away my wallet with a fussy toddler. The restaurant itself is cramped. Too many tables and not much room to walk around. The high chairs were located all the way by the restrooms. Multiple employees saw me struggling to carry my 1 year old and trying to lug a high chair over to my table. Did they offer their assistance? Nope, not one! 

Now for the food, if it wasn't for that super delicious soup that I mentioned in the beginning, this place would be 1 Star. I'm not a fan of high prices and small portions. And that's exactly what you get here. My tiny sandwich and small cup of soup with a drink cost me $14. But damn you cheddar broccoli soup and your magical spell over me!"}
{"text":"Clean, fast, super friendly. One of the better Panera's that I have been too. 
My only beef is I think there are to many seats for the space, and when it is busy it feels WAY over crowded and hard to have a conversation with someone."}
{"text":"I really really wanted this to be awesome. I work next door and have been teased by the \"Coming Soon\" sign for what feels like an eternity! Well, the day had finally come, March 5, the GRAND OPENING of my new breakfast and lunch hot spot. 

Grand opening I was so happy they were finally open. My coworkers and I walked on over for some breakfast. I ordered a Four Cheese souffle and a medium Americano. They were pretty quick, happy to see you, greeted with a smile. Score! I'm happy now. Got our food and walked back over to our office. Coffee was great, I'm eating my souffle....there's a hunk of something in it that I bite down on. Upon further inspection of said souffle, there are artichokes in it. Ok, no biggie, I just didn't realize there were artichokes in the four cheese one....and upon inspecting the site, there's not. They had incorrectly given me the Spinach and Artichoke one. Not an awful mistake, except it's 70 calories more and I ordered the Four Cheese because it was lower in calories.

Lunch, let's just head on over and we can regain our excitement of Panera being next door. I decide on the Power Mediterranean Roasted Turkey Salad. Looks super tasty, super healthy and again I am happy! We get our lunch and head on back over to our office. I open up my lunch...what a cute box. A little disappointed because from outside the little boxed window it doesn't look very big. Not very big at all for a $9 salad. Oh well, I open it up and stop in my tracks. There's some turkey, cool; olives, check; no lemon juice, but 2 olive oils; and spinach, like less than 20 leaves. I move aside the spinach looking for more and I just get the bottom of the cardboard box....where's the rest of it. There's no \"salad\" in my salad. Now I'm totally bummed. I call over, more-so to let them know the kitchen might have a hiccup and the Manager tells me they want to make it right, to come on over and they'll fix it. At this point, there's a line out of the door and we just agree to take care of it the next day. 

Panera isn't all it's cracked up to be so far. BUT....they have promised to make it right!! And now here we are. Walked on over this morning, spoke with the Manager who once again apologized. No biggie, bumps in the road, it happens. I order up a coffee and the Power Breakfast Egg Bowl with Steak. The girl at the register isn't sure how to ring it in, the manager helps her...I hold my breath.....ok, we're all set. She comped my breakfast and coffee, the order got put in, we're golden right? Grab my bag, we walk on back. Sit down at my desk, mmmm steak and eggs and avacado and.....at this point is where you hear the screeching halt of tires. I get that things in real life don't look like stuff in the professional photographs, but they didn't even try. For some reason my breakfast was on salad (maybe that's making up for the lack of it from the lunch) the \"Two all-natural eggs, freshly cracked every morning\" were actually just two ice cold egg white patties. Gross. And their \"seared steak\", well that was a cold chewy mess as well. I couldn't even stomach it. Take a look at the picture:  http://i62.tinypic.com/2hcnsk2.jpg

After all that, they've struck out 3 times and lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"Pfffftttttt.......ordered the scrambled egg breakfast with bacon and toast.
The eggs.....terrible.
Bacon.....its the PRE COOKED bacon......I HAVE THIS AT HOME!
Toast.....1 piece and from the smallest loaf in the history of bread.
I only came to kill an hour and use the WiFi.

Go somewhere else for a real breakfast."}
{"text":"Good comfort food the service is very slow .howeverI don't know why they wear gloves because they touch everything with that one set of gloves they wear"}
{"text":"Pitiful !  Stay away from the steak and cheese.  This is what $5.99 buys you. Maybe 1-2 ounces of meat at best. Guess profit is an issue."}
{"text":"Disappointed to say the least. My coworker and I order from this store multiple times throughout the week. We love it. This is the second time this week that our order has been wrong. There was a hair in my food!!!!!!! They gave me 2 different dressings, they did not include our baguettes on our order, yet they are on the receipt, and the Mac and cheese looks and tastes completely different than normal. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"New Panera Bread on our area, love this place. Thank you for coming to our neighborhood."}
{"text":"As long time Panera fans, my wife and I were disappointed to have to walk out of two of our regular Paneras (one located at Ballantyne and the other at Pineville-Matthews & Carmel Rd intersection) due to consistently (and I emphasize, \"consistently\") unacceptable sanitary conditions in the low 90s before finally arriving at this shiny new Waverly location. Of course \"new\" can be deceiving; however, immediately upon entry, I recognized a long-time manager from the Arboretum store leading things here, which was cause for optimism (as was the high sanitation score). We arrived during the rush hour on a Saturday.

The entire restaurant and its workers did appear to be clean and the food was of the quality that we had grown to know and expect from Panera. Servers were also friendly and attentive. My wife and I ordered You-Pick-Twos, one with the grilled cheese and Ancient Grain, Arugula & Chicken Salad and the other with French onion soup and the Green Goddess Cobb Salad with Chicken. Other than the grilled cheese being a little on the dry side, everything was expertly prepared and displayed. Most importantly, it was delicious.

This will remain our go-to location, as we have given up on the others. I have confidence that as long as Carl, the \"super manager\", is here, that will remain to be the case. Otherwise, we will just move on from Panera altogether, as there is certainly no shortage of choices in the area."}
{"text":"It's a shame how everything about this once excellent restaurant has declined over the past several years. As a matter of fact, today was the last straw for us, after eating here weekly for the past 10 years. We're done! Let the eternal help wanted sign on the door serve as warning.

To begin with, I had to wait 10 minutes in line with only one person in front of me at the checkout counters while two cashiers fumbled away at the cash registers. I then had to wait another 10 minutes for my food to arrive. My order was a fairly simple breakfast sandwich and was tiny and just ok when it did arrive. If that wasn't bad enough, they completely hosed an order to go which consisted of another breakfast sandwich and a latte. Unfortunately, it wasn't until I got home that my wife discovered the latte had nutmeg added and the sandwich lacked cheese, both in error according to my receipt. As a result, she had to make a separate trip back to get things right.

Food quality had already become hit or miss, as well as the service. For more info, see my prior review. But once again, we will not be back. Save yourself the trouble, either go to a different Panera or somewhere else entirely."}
{"text":"Panera has really stepped up their game lately with the introduction of seasonal favorites, broth bowls and pasta dishes so I decided to go their for lunch today. I got the pick two: half roasted turkey sandwich (seasonal) and the half chicken thai salad, which is my favorite! I highly recommend the seasonal roasted turkey sandwich, which included roasted turkey, Vermont white cheddar, apple and cabbage slaw, arugula and a special sauce on cranberry walnut bread. WOW! The bread was the perfect addition and really made the sandwich. I didn't want it to end. Plus the you pick two came with a side- I opted for the baked chips.

This location is always busy, but they also have kiosks where you can place an order on your own. I've never seen this in a Panera before. I used the kiosk and was given a buzzer. The tables have this cool feature where you place the buzzer in a specific spot so the servers know where to find you. It was very convenient. Plus they work on the outdoor tables."}
{"text":"They have great, customer service we had a young gentleman that took the time to explain all the questions I had he even got the bread to show me. Food was great place was clean,."}
{"text":"Great food as like any panera bread. This has been my second time here and I never had any issues until today. I flagged down an employee in regards to my order I made through the app because it was taking so long just to get two things (lemonade and fruit cup). The employee was extremely condescending while I showed him  my receipt. My girlfriend had a separate order with two large cups, a salad, and soup. The way he was making it seem was that I took a large cup without paying for it and asked if I was going to use that cup for the lemonade. I quickly explained that we made two orders and paid for it. I've never have had this happen before. Really makes me not want to come to this location to spend my money if I'm going to be treated like I didn't pay for what I have on my table."}
{"text":"I love their cinnamon crunch bagel and soon to try the chicken salad sandwich. so fresh and inexpensive."}
{"text":"I recently met a few friends here for lunch and conversation.  I ordered a sandwich and salad and for the second time was very disappointed in the quality of the sandwich.  The bread was stale as it had been a few months ago and there was nothing especially great about the rest of it either.  The salad was limp.
While their muffins are good, that is about it.
I do not plan to give this Paradise a third chance."}
{"text":"I LOVEEEE this locationokay like this is an experience. I have been to A LOT of Panera Breads in my life and hands down this is the HOLY GRAIL, THE HONEY HOLE, literally rocks my world. The staff knows exactly what they're doing and always have a BIG smile on their faces. They are doing amazing sweetie"}
{"text":"I am in love with this restaurant.  Every location I've ever been to (thank god there are so many!) has been clean, friendly, and superior quality.

There isn't much on the menu I haven't tried at some point.  I can't think of anything I don't like here.  One of my favorites is actually the veggie sandwich.  It's always so fresh and flavorful!  I also love the baguette bread you can get as a side.  Bread and butter is one of those instantly happy things for me.  

I often run by here to pick up fresh bread and bagels, too.  Especially if we are expecting house guests.  It's such a nice little treat.  They also have a pretty generous rewards program for regular customers.  More often than not I get a free drink or pastry during my visit.

Stop by any Panera, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Panera is my go to place for breakfast catering and regardless of I'm on the east or west coast, the service is always good and they go above and beyond to help.

The new self service options are the best I've experienced in any food establishment. And every time I checkout at the register the associate reminds me of my rewards."}
{"text":"I like the food, but the service needs some work. Today they decided that my turkey sandwich would be better on white bread instead of sourdough bread, although they never mentioned anything to me. They messed up the order that was right before me as well. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Went to Panera for lunch and the service was good but my sandwich was a mess. Kinda just thrown together. The pesto and tomatoes were all on one pile in the middle of the sandwich instead of just dispersing it. Also a tiny ripped up flimsy piece of cheese was thrown on it and it just didn't look good. The mac and cheese I had was good so gave it two stars."}
{"text":"I love Panera Bread. And this location is my favorite. They always get the order right (you'd be surprised how many places these days can't lol) and the staff is always friendly and efficient!"}
{"text":"Wow! Thank you Panera. What a great, nice, clean, tremendous variety of goodies diner. You can walk up to the ordering station and type in your own order. Grab a cup of joe (in a ceramic cup!! you've won my heart, connect to the free wifi and they bring you your food. No waiting in line! The Panera in the District is losing it's luster and I have been concerned and saddened that the new bakery stores are taking over but not if this Panera has anything to do with it! YaY! Go Panera! thanks for the super yummy danish and coffee and wifi xoxo i will be back!"}
{"text":"This Panera is very disappointing and the employees seem to care more about daily operations and customer service than the managers do.  I say this because I have experienced issues on multiple occasions here.  The store itself is in a great location but they don't have a daytime Baker here because they claim they don't have the business.  That results in them being sold out of alot of different product especially when they process large orders, deliveries and  catering.  You would think they could call in someone when they run out of nearly all bagels but do they no.  The prices are seemingly high for my liking as they tend to increase more often than not.  I'd probably feel better spending my hard earned dollars at another local business.  The only real reason I spend money here is because they willingly accept Android Pay, Apple Pay etc at the register.  It's not accepted at the iPad kiosks though.  This location needs to do better!"}
{"text":"Hair at the bottom of my mac n cheese and the Mac n cheese was super salty. The portions also got smaller."}
{"text":"Extremely dissatisfied. My husband and I love Panera realized that there was one within 5 minutes of where we are staying so with that said we where really looking forward to eating here especially after a week of \"fast food\" i.e. McDonald's. Neither of us have ever had an issue with customer service or food at any other Panera until today at this location. What we received shouldn't even be considered a sandwich! The bread is stale dry and rock hard. The grilled cheese was stale pieces of bread and a cold slice of cheese not even melted or warm. I called to let them know that our order was disappointing and they asked me to bring back the food for a remake. With it being later in the evening I told them I would not be back out today for a remake, I needed to get my kids in bed and get ready for tomorrow. But I can bring them their food back tomorrow. Their \"manager\" tried to explain their process on how they make their bread and keep it as fresh as possible, which I am well aware of because of past employment within my family. The \"manager\" offered to replace the food tomorrow but was extremely rude and seemed displeased that I didn't want to go back out again tonight for food. The manager said I will replace the 2 sandwiches and grilled cheese and hung up."}
{"text":"Great food. Love the gourmet style sandwich options. Had their Pick 2 option. I had a Avocado Turkey BLT....loved, loved, loved it!!!! Also, I tortellini Alfredo. 
It was really good, but the portion size could have been slightly bigger. I got half a sandwich and a portion of pasta.Finished my meal in less than 10 mins.
Their tasty looking treats caught my eyes and I had to have one. I got a Cinnamon Crunch pastry. It was too delicious for words. 
My cashier was so friendly and helpful.
My only issue was with the cost. I spent over $15. Ouch!!! Too much for lunch time, and for half a sandwich and such a small serving of pasta. But it was so good, I will return but I'll order something else maybe just a sandwich on its' own."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich shop in Las Vegas.
Plus it's so relaxing here. They have great customer service and will continue to give you as much brad as you want if you ask."}
{"text":"Taking Too long 
I order on line 
It's asking me if I want to get it in 8-10 mins or longer 
I took the 8 mins 
Got there after 10 mins and they order took 35 mins 
\"Sorry \" that's what they said 
Never again"}
{"text":"We have probably eaten at the Panera chain more than any other restaurant over the past 10 years and this is our favorite Charlotte location. It's a shame however how much about this once excellent restaurant has declined over the past several years. Food quality can be hit or miss, same with service. 

Menu variety though is still a strength and is regularly refreshed based upon season. The dining area is comfortably configured at this location and includes a dependable wireless signal. 

If you are lucky enough to score some freshly baked bread, the breakfast sandwiches are very tasty, but the quality of the baked items themselves is inconsistent and depends upon the baker I suppose. Bagels are very good but  are more more cake-like than bagel-like. The cinnamon crunch ones are delicious and make for a great dessert. Other breakfast options include single serve quiches and steel cut oatmeal.

For lunch, the salads are varied and interesting. I especially enjoy the the Spicy Thai Salad with Chicken which is served with a spicy peanut dressing. I typically pair it with it one of their fresh soups as a You-Pick-2 deal. All of the soups are superb especially their chicken noodle with veggies.

Coffee is good but selection needs variety. only choices are Bold, Light Roast, Hazelnut and Decaf. Coffee condiments are superb and include honey and natural sugar. The latte is one off the best I've ever had.

Overall, Panera is still a wonderful concept and we do dine there semi-regularly; however, since its inception, I feel both its quality and overall value has fallen. One contributor may be due to the that fact that its staff seems to be constantly changing. As a result, we find ourselves regularly bypassing it for a growing list of much better independent Charlotte bakeries. What I once would have described as excellent has just become average, with this location bring a bit better."}
{"text":"Actually, for a Panera, this was quite nice.

I was at the Petersen Event Center and this was a quick walk down the hill....idiot me never realized I'd eventually have to go back up the hill.

The restaurant is huge...they must have room to seat 300 people, and every visit it's always been packed.

Surprisingly, this Panera, for its location has a decent staff.  They're quick and they prepare their easily prepared national chain foods quickly.

Personal pet peeve that Panera's are Pepsi establishments but soda and pop are bad for you and I shouldn't drink it anyways."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place was busy both times I came here. Both times the food was completely disappointing and overpriced. Sure, it's a relatively nice place to eat with comfortable seating but the food does not make up for it. Service was nothing to rave about, it's like any other fast food counter service. 

I paid close to (more than I think) $10 for a half salad and half sandwich. The sandwich was tiny and for that price, I thought my roasted turkey & avocado BLT would at least be warm. Not only was it cold, it was made with the cheapest, thinnest white bread and wasn't even toasted. The turkey was sad and flavourless. The accompanying salad was soggy and average at best. My boyfriend's mac and cheese was tiny. It tasted alright, like any normal mac and cheese that you can make at home. The bread that came with it was again, cold and hard. With the tiny portions, we weren't even full afterwards.

I saw a lot of other patrons ordering pastas and pastries. The pastries looked good, but if the food we ordered was any indicator, they'd probably also be cold and not living up to how they look. 

You get all you can drink iced tea though, with several flavours. So I guess that's nice. Probably will never come back though.

(15/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"I live close by so I go here frequently pretty much for the free WIFI and espresso. But here's a secret - they don't seem to know what an Americano is so often I am charged like 75 cents for a double shot of espresso to which they add hot water upon my request. Needless to say coffee is not expensive here as you can fill up as many times as needed without being hassled. Although there regular coffee is undrinkable to my taste. Pastries are baked fresh and are plentiful. There is other foods to choose from ie whole grain bagels are edible and about a buck with no extra charge for butta. Outside seating and people watching is always a good distraction plus there are all kinds of people who frequent this Panera from the very very old and decrepit to the fashionistas taking a break from Victoria Secrets, Ulta, Wet Seal and the other various shops at this water front location."}
{"text":"Wow! Best panera stop ever! So clean! They brought our order to our table. I had the thai chicken salad and it was way better than my panera back home makes it! Yummmm!!! Quick and easy to order and our food came fast! Again best panera I have ever stopped at."}
{"text":"Food is OK but service could use some work.

Stopped in today for lunch with my wife. Did not see much that looked interesting but being a fan of a Cuban Sandwich, I ordered a Cuban Panini.  Only complaint was that granted a Cuban has pickles on it, this one had so many undrained pickle slices on it that it dripped when you picked it us. Very messy sandwich and there were so many pickles , that was just about all you could taste.

My wife on the other hand, did not make out at well. She is on a Weight Watchers Diet and planned here meal before we even got there. She wanted one of her favorites which is also one of Panera's signature soup and that is the Chicken Noodle Soup along with a smoked turkey sandwich.

1:15 pm and we're still making the Chicken Noodle Soup. When we left at 2:00 pm, they were still making the Soup.

The Turkey Sandwich arrived in a bowl because the  young lady who entered the order, entered it as no Bread.  They did take it back and create a sandwich out of it.

Otherwise nice although a bit crowded and noisy."}
{"text":"Def reccomend this place. They offer breakfast and lunch items. 
I love the choice of \"pick 2\". Two items for a great price."}
{"text":"On a Friday noon, on a working day, the place was full! We needed a table for 3 but we couldn't find one inside so we just took a table outside while we find one inside. In the meantime, we also ordered our food using the Kiosks which are super convenient, placed on two sides and saving time especially during the lunch rush. 
I was in the mood for soup, so I ordered the French onion soup and a side watermelon and feta salad. My friends also ordered soup each and one of the ladies ordered a sandwich and the other ordered a fruit salad. 

We were served our food in no time. Everything looked delicious. I loved that my soup did not have a lot of cheese on top (even though I do love cheese); it is healthier this way. I also enjoyed my watermelon salad, although I wished there was more feta in it. I was hardly able to taste it. 

Overall, very good quality. Prices are average or slightly on the more expensive side considering the portion size but the food is pretty good so I'll be eating here again especially to have the French onion soup again!"}
{"text":"Got the broth bowl for lunch and it looked nothing like the menu, It was okay but will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"Panera is a chain so the food stays pretty consistent. The service here is phenomenal! Bussers during lunch to keep things clean and make sure the tables turn over.  

I appreciated that there was a good number of baked goods. Not to mention, the line moved quickly. If you plan to go to a chain, head over here."}
{"text":"Went in yesterday for the first time since this location transitioned from the Paradise Bakery name to Panera Bread.  The first thing I found out was that my Paradise Bakery rewards card was no longer valid.  The remodeled space is lighter and brighter, but that's about the only good thing.  I counted at least 7 employees bustling around behind the counter (with many more in the kitchen), but only ONE person was actually taking orders and payments from the customers.  She was very slow--even though it was 2:30pm and the lunch rush was over.  With only 1 customer ahead of me, it took 5 FULL minutes for her to take that person's order and payment and over 3 MORE minutes to take my order and money, even though I knew exactly what I wanted--and then another 4 full minutes waiting for pickup (they have a bench now, so wait times MUST be longer).

I was glad to see that they still have the chicken-walnut salad on molasses bread--but it is not nearly as good as it used to be because:
** There is now a much smaller portion of chicken salad on the full sandwich for the same price of nearly $7.50.
** No more free cookie (you have to include a drink with your sandwich order & then you get to BUY a cookie for ONLY 99 cents more.
** My to-go order had a pickle spear (which I didn't order and do not like) wrapped up with the sandwich, with a lot of pickle juice getting absorbed by the bread, plus a 1-ounce bag of chips (that I also didn't order and do not like), which I tossed into the garbage can when I got home.

Ordering a sandwich from Paradise Bakery and getting the free chocolate chip cookie used to be an occasional mid-day treat--not any more!"}
{"text":"Doesn't matter what time of day I come in here the service is always great and the orders are taken and given quickly."}
{"text":"9/28/17 around 6:10pm Terminal 4 Gate C 17. I ordered a sandwich at Panera at their new remodeled area with their tablet. Pretty cool technology. But here is the truth. They were behind over 30mins on orders. One person was waiting 1 hour. Yes 1 hour. I know these reviews can get extreme but this is completely accurate. No one working at Panera made any announcement or tried to take action. The TV monitor was not updating people orders. People kept ordering food through their tablets; which takes your payment with no receipt. I finally realized that I am not going to get my food soon so I went up to the manager. She was refunding people their money back: one guy waited 1 hour, another 30 minutes like I said above. People had to board their flights after waiting and had no way to get their money back. What was the worst part was that the manager actually left! She decided to walk away around 6:30pm. I wanted to go ask her where are you going. You could tell that they had no clue what to do. 
I hope they changed their systems on taking orders and give everyone who could not get their food and paid their money back. Please go get food somewhere else at the airport until they resolve this."}
{"text":"I was working on a network tv show (which I told them when I placed my order) and I had to order lunch for the small cast and crew (11 orders) . I begged them to make sure it was correct. There wasn't even a difficult order (no substitutions) and due to union rules, there are only 30 min for lunch, so if they screw up, I don't have time to go back and fix it. Nathan assured me it would all be ok. I told him, please make sure because I will be FIRED from my job if there was mistakes. (Due to the disaster from ordering lunch from a different place the day before). When I got there, everything looked good, everyone's lunches seemed to be separated and bagged. I paid and got in the car. Ummm where are the two drinks I ordered? Went back in, and oops,  we forgot...thank god I caught it,  I thought. Now I have just enough time to get back to set. When I got back, THREE lunches were missing and several were incomplete (missing soups). I called to speak to the manager, she was nice and she felt bad, but she said \" I'm not surprised that your order was screwed up because Nathan is really stupid\". 
Awesome.
So thank you panera bread, I have never been fired before- all because some of your employees are too stupid to handle 11 lunch orders. 
And, no, it was to be picked up in the afternoon, well past actual lunchtime. It was empty when I got there."}
{"text":"I stopped in a few weeks ago when I was in town to meet a friend for lunch. This is like any typical Panera Bread. My order was taken quickly and efficiently, the food was good and hot. It was crowded because it was lunch time on a weekend around a mall, that's a given like always. The two things I didn't really like at this specific Panera was the sitting arrangements and the parking lot. The seating was crazy spread out from everything and a real pain to drag a high chair around in. The park was just in the back, which was confusing for a first time visitor because I didn't know if there was a door in the back or if I had to walk toward the front. I ended up parking next door and walking over. Once inside I found out that there is in fact a door toward the back parking lot. I would just highly suggest a redesign in terms of layout."}
{"text":"I LOVE Panera. I eat Panera multiple times in a week. And I want to love this location, it's on my way to work, they delivered to my office, it should be perfect. But, they are terrible. Something in my order is alway wrong. Their salads and sandwiches are sloppily put together and it seems like the people assembling them simply don't care. 

I purchased a breakfast sandwich this morning and the egg wasn't even on the sandwich... the entire thing was a mess and not appetizing at all. Picture attached. 

While waiting for my order this morning, an employee ran food to a table and brought it back and said (in front of me), \"this needs to be remade, he didn't want tomato. I was just going to pick it off, but didn't know what you wanted to do.\""}
{"text":"Not far from home, but I don't frequent it much because it's too expensive and for what they charge, I can't say they give you much to eat. The soups are pretty good, but I was disappointed once with their French onion soup. I will not order it again from there. Sandwiches are good, but, again, too pricey and the sandwich is small. Sorry I cannot say many outstanding things about Panera. Millennials seem to love it and some elderly folks also seem to love it, but this senior citizen is not impressed."}
{"text":"Retrain staff please my man Xaviar shouldn't be greeting customers, oh wait he didn't greet me I pretty much had to say \"hi do u work here\"? Reallllly bad!! no can I help you, no suggestive selling, no thank you, it would of at least been entertaining if he said \" whatcha want beoytch\"
2 stars because the food was fast.."}
{"text":"loved the hot sandwiches...yum! and the apple cinnamon muffin was pretty good too."}
{"text":"I Love all Panera, equally!
I am def a fan of this easy, better than fast food, time-killing eatery.

Great place for a lunch social/date with good eats and a good place to sit and talk for a while or to get some work done between appointments.

PROS:
Great Food;
Free WiFi (though some locations are limited to 30 minutes during the lunch hour);
Seating is always tricky at the lunch hour.

CONS:
pricey for salads, soup and sandwiches;
tables should be wiped more frequently--even if you have to ask a newly seated guest if they would like it wiped, the tables should be wiped!

For Pete's sake, give a fork with the Mac and Cheese, not a SPOON!  lol"}
{"text":"Always have been a fan of Panera Bread for their soup's/salad's, sandwiches and free wifi but I have to say the last couple times I've been disappointed. I ordered their special You Pick Two / half sandwich and bowl of chicken noodle soup with an apple. This time the bread was dry, not sure if they forgot the condiments or if it didn't call for it - and the soup was cold. It was so odd to me as I've always had great food from Panera. I sent the food back and after at least another ten minutes I got a fresh order, and it was hot soup and a sandwich with mayo as I had to request....They were friendly and apologetic, not sure what happened but they fixed it."}
{"text":"This place used to be run well before the corporate management change. At this point they have changed quite a few recipes to cut costs and it shows. One of my favourites used to be the Brocolli Cheddar soup which has been changed (for the worst) and now tastes very much like the overly processed crap found at cheaper restaurants. The service hasn't been the same with a lot of the older employees leaving because of the changes in management and management practices. Had to wait for about 10 minutes and had to go through 3 employees for someone to find me a lid for my drink and was told that they were out. Prices do not reflect the quality of food or the service anymore. I'd rather direct my business to mom and pop cafes/restaurants."}
{"text":"Placed a delivery order yesterday which arrived way ahead of my selected delivery window, normally not something I would complain about but I selected that window for a reason (I wasn't home and was only going to be for a few minutes). My sandwich was the saddest Mediterranean Veggie sandwich I've ever had from any Panera location and it certainly did not have \"extra\" anything or even the normal amount of veggies it usually has on it. Last time I ordered for Rapid Pick up my drink was forgotten - Disappointed with this location time and time again."}
{"text":"I love Panera! 

My favorite thing about this location was the staff. The woman who waited on us was very friendly and ensured that we were satisfied with all of our choices. The cashier also made sure to tell us about all the choices we had, and what charges were going to be extra. When I choose the pastry, I picked a particular one that I saw in the case, and she made sure she had the exact one I wanted. I like when the staff take time to make the customer happy. 

For lunch choices, I had the broccoli cheddar soup and a baguette. My fiancé has the soup, sprouted grain roll, Italian sandwich, and the pastry for dessert. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Fresh food fast. Right in my neighborhood. Really like the Spinach Power Salad, and the parm-croutons on the Caesar salad are really tasty. Nice to have delish chocolate croissants close to home. They do specialty coffee drinks, latte and espresso. Its been a warm spot on recent cold days to sit by their fireplace. Ahhh!"}
{"text":"My complaint about Panera remains the same...why can't they fill the dressing cup?? Every time I go the dressing cup is never full. I paid almost 10 dollars for a full size Green Goddess Cobb and the 1.5 oz cups of dressing were barely even half full. I only had enough to cover half of my salad. So disappointing."}
{"text":"This is your standard Panera bread.  Nothing special, but it's good for the following:

-Breakfast
-Wi-fi
-Any type of coffee

Not good for:
-Big groups (booths are a bit crammed)
-Lunch (I find the pick 2 ridiculously expensive and very bad value).

What you should get now: they have a breakfast special where you get any breakfast item + any espresso/cappucino/latte for $6.99."}
{"text":"Thai chicken salad is amazing. so is broccoli cheddar soup. 

I really want to like the cranberry chicken sandwich but it's not awesome. 

Southwest chicken salad is also good. 

Their little chocolate chipper cookies are delicious and bite size, way better than they're bigger ones. 

Sometimes the line is wayyy too slow but that comes with freshly prepared food. 

Overall, love."}
{"text":"When they first opened, I was so excited since it was right across the street from my school. The mac and cheese was still wonderful so all was well. 

Then I had to stop eating the Mac and cheese and I went to a Caesar salad, which I've ordered quite a bit. The last maybe 5 times I've gotten it I've been very disappointed. The lettuce was soggy and old and I had to throw it away. 

Lots of waste for such an expensive meal. Will not be eating there anymore. 

BRING BACK PARADISE!"}
{"text":"All right I have a confession to make.  I have never been to a Panera Bread before.

We were shopping for the holidays and were famished, smelt the bread and followed the scent.  Walk into a packed house and got a bit excited.  We are not big carb consumers so when I do I get excited.  Looked over the menu, well organized and easy to choose your options.  We both decided on the soup and sandwich option.

For a quick sandwich hot lunch option, I will absolutely be back.  I am sad I missed this much of my life of this not being an option! 

Service at the desk was good, service cleaning tables was good as well.

I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Oh my.  I don't know what is going on at the \"always reliable\" Panera Bread. Or at least this location. Ugh. Worst PB experience ever..  Lackadasical service, if you can even use the word service.  Food was mediocre.  Brown avocado on my sandwich, bacon cooked maybe sometime this week?  The ice tea containers were either empty or merged to fill one up with the dregs from the others.  And the drink area was disgusting.  This PB is off my list, permanently."}
{"text":"As Joanne R. said, I usually love Paradise Cafe and this location is convenient for me but this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I just came from yoga so was pretty mellow about all the curve balls they sent me. They didn't have the bagel for the sandwich, was I okay with whole grain? I was.  I didn't want to drink out of a paper cup and wanted a nice mug, but they are out of them. What can you do? 

In a weak moment I ordered this carrot cake, thinking I would take half of it home with me but the breakfast sandwich order took so long, I had finished that dang cake and felt sickly full. Okay, I can't blame them for my lack of discipline; just the long wait.

 The busboy was around picking up busily, so I asked him to check on the order but then it shows up. There is a little hair in the sandwich, blond, not mine. I understand how that happens and know it won't kill me, so don't say anything. 

The sandwich is just okay. I probably couldn't eat it all because of eating all that carrot cake, so I ask the busboy to bring me a to-go container. He's sweet and friendly and I regret that I don't have change to leave on the table for him. I go refill my coffee and get change for the tip. I find out that they put hazelnut coffee in the light roast, so let the manager-looking lady know. 

I look for the busboy to give him the tip but don't see him. He's already cleaned the table, so don't want to leave it there. I was going to just leave it with the cashier but see the manager lady and give it to her and tell her the busboy was very helpful and she agrees. But under her breath, she says\" I don't know why she just didn't leave it  on the table.\"  That sense of nastiness just left a bad taste in my mouth. Otherwise I might not have felt impelled to write this review. 

I probably will skip this location next time."}
{"text":"Had my second drive thru experience today. Sooooo slow. And messed up my order both times. Recommend going in and NOT using the drive thru."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Salad Sandwich second time from this store today. Will try more menu on the item and update this review.

Now I'm not a fan of Don Mills Center, but I'll be back for Panera Bread.

1. Parking it a hassle, but that is Don Mills Center. Not Panera Bread.
2. It was lunch hour. There are 4 cashiers/order takers and they were all open. 
3. Got to place my order right away with one of the friendly staff.
4. Order was ready ready in a few minutes and off you go.

The restaurant is clean. That sandwich is spot on. And that is all I expect from Panera."}
{"text":"Typical Panera, but worse. This one is always crowded, and rarely gets an order correct without prompting. Several times I've had missing food or completely wrong orders after I've gotten home. Plus they regularly run out of a lot of their menu. They never have souffles."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Panera. I always have a good experience with them and the food is always great. This time I ordered 2 large Mac and cheeses for myself and my roommate and when I got home there was 2 small Mac and cheeses. The Mac and cheese was great just too small for us to feel full after."}
{"text":"This Panera is like all the others, free wifi, a good place to study, and free refills on coffee.  However, this one closes early at 8p every day except Sunday, when they close at 7p.  Usually they are nice and won't kick you out right at closing.  There are also only a few good tables to get power if you are using a laptop, and they aren't the best for spreading out your studying material.  But it's free, so I don't want to complain.  

Overall, the food is good.  If you are l looking for something healthy, get the \"You Pick Two\" with a turkey sandwich and black bean soup."}
{"text":"Fast service. They were out of a few items though. Bagels are good. Needed to be toasted a little more. Need more kids items"}
{"text":"I like Panera's food and I typically have a good experience there but my visit tonight was terrible.

I visited at 6pm and it wasn't very busy at all. I ordered chicken soup in a bread bowl. They were out of bread bowls. OK, disappointing but I ordered a cup of soup anyway. That's all I ordered...a cup of chicken soup. And then I waited...and waited...and waited. After 20 minutes, only one person ahead of me had gotten her food order and it was clear that I wasn't getting my food anytime soon. So I returned to the register to cancel my order and ask for my money back. The kid working the register went and got a manager. More waiting. He cancelled my order and returned my money, and never spoke to me the entire time. I was in that Panera for almost 30 minutes and left without getting any food.

So, to recap: no bread bowls, 20+ minute wait for soup, another wait for my money back, an unpleasant manager. Overall, terrible experience. If I could give this review zero stars, I would do."}
{"text":"This place always seems to be packed so I've learned to place my order ahead of time now... highly suggest this if your lunch time is limited.
OMG I LOVE the salads here. I know they are not the most healthy salads around but I honestly don't care. The Fugi Apple Chicken salad is to die for! Yum. Big pieces of dried apples, large and flavorful chicken chunks and the dressing is delicious as well. Probably one of the best salad's I've had.... perhaps I'll go this weekend, now that I've written this review I want one :)"}
{"text":"Nice early morning coffee and work spot. Free WiFi. Not annoying music selections. Staff is pleasant. The cafe is clean. Food and drink and standardized well. There's outdoor seating as well. Lots of parking and easy to navigate to. It gets crazier in nearer the lunch hours but you can order ahead or there is fast quiosk options in store. I'd just opt for delivery :)."}
{"text":"Food is always great. Service super slow. Got may soup but waited 15 Min for my sandwich. It was to go. Soup is now cold. :( got half way home realized that the forget my side. Ugh. Terrible service"}
{"text":"This is a candidate for 'Worst Panera Ever'. Now, the food is fine (mostly). It *is* Panera, after all. But I'm judging this location by its own standard...answering the question: \"Does this restaurant excel at what it attempts to do?\" The answer is a resounding \"no\". 

There are two main problems here: First, quality of service. Ninety-five percent of the staff at this location act as if they wish you would just leave them alone. They speak in barely audible tones; when you stand at the register, they do not greet you, rather, they stare at you and wait for you to place your order. Behind the counter, there always seems to be some sort of crisis--people are running everywhere, they're always out of something, everyone seems a little confused.

Second, quality of food. Again, this is Panera, so this is a minimum level of quality you can expect. However, the manner in which the staff slaps the meals together leaves much to be desired. Expect to get spilled soup, sloppy, tipped-over sandwiches, wet napkins, apples with bruises...the list goes on. It's slack, and not up to the standards of other Panera locations. 

I eat at this location solely because it is near my office. So, good job to Panera's corporate real estate department for selecting this site. However, given my choice, I would eat at *any* other Panera in Northeast Ohio before this one. I really hope they improve their game--this location is an embarrassment to the franchise."}

{"text":"Great first time experience. I went light with the chicken Caesar salad, but none the less it it the SPOT! Very fulfilling and super fresh. My friend tried the chicken chipotle panini and he was satisfied as well. Nothing to WOW about it, the food is good though. Kind of like a Paradise Bakery concept."}

I got here one minute before my order was due to come out, instead no order, then five minutes after they employees are back there laughing n having a good ol' time do they come to ask me if I'm waiting for my food. Why yes I am! \"Oh we are out of what you order.\" So you haven't even started my food 15 minutes after it was supposed to be done. Then long story short I get it, it was made wrong and I've had warmer ice cubes in my day. Terrible costumes service!"}
{"text":"im happy to come here.  its always a decent experience.  im so happy they put french onion soup back on the menu for a little while they took it off the menu (not sure why something about it being seasonal)... but last week when i went it was back on the menu and its my fav.  i love the mix and match combos."}
{"text":"Their product is as good as any other Panera, but the management of inventory and service side of things at this location needs a LOT of improvement. I live around the corner and the wife always wants to go and for some reason I keep giving them chances lol. Today we went in around 9:30 (an hour left to go on breakfast) and they were already completely dry of what seemed like half their bagel options. A sign of poor inventory tracking. Havent had this issue at other locations. They took our order with asiago bagels and was later informed they were out. No problem, Ill choose the cinnamon crunch instead. I just ordered it with butter toasted. The wife had some asiago sandwich ordered so she chose an everything bagel as her option. The cashier apologized and we undwrstood, we can be flexible. Got home and open the bags. Her order was right but I ended up with a toasted everything bagel with a side of cream cheese... i know first world problems, etc. I wasnt too upset, but for $10 for a sandwich, bagel, and a drink it should be what we ordered.  Fair warning,  check your bag here before you leave at this location!"}
{"text":"I don't often dine at Panera Bread but when I do, service is friendly and I order only the breakfast sandwiches. They've discontinued my favorite turkey, spinach and egg white on sprouted grain, but the staff went above duty to find a new alternative and favorite - the Mediterranean egg white with basil pesto (not only the menu, so you'd have to ask for it by name). I'm tempted by the endless line up of delicious looking pastries - cookies, muffins, croissants and cakes but I'm not trying to be \"carbie Barbie\" anymore. Panera is a great option for those who are looking for healthy choices, vegetarians, and those who pay attention to nutrition facts. And yes, those who just like good eats! The restaurant is relatively clean, they have a unique selection of refreshments, and is managed mostly by the under 30 crowd (nothing wrong with that, just an observation). Overall, 4 stars for the robust menu and good service!"}
{"text":"I went today......Absolutely Horrid. I do not understand how this place is still in business. Terrible food and even worse service. They have no coffee, they had the cashier doing soups too, it was a total freakin mess. I could not get regular coffee because they had none, no one filled it it since 12:45 and it was 4:30. So they gave me a free latte which was freakin terrible. The cashier was giving shit away to the customers because she did not give a shit. Pathetic.  I have not been to this establishment  in over 8 years due to it being complete CRAP. Why people still come here is beyond me. The food is mediocre at best. I much rather spend my money at Wildflower! 20 times better products, fantastic service and great food/coffee. Paradise bakery is not a place I will set foot into again. This is typical AZ wanabe garbage!"}
{"text":"I like be this place. Ate lunch here yesterday with my daughter. We were actually at the Ballantyne location. The food was great as usual. We both had the strawberry poppyseed salad with grilled chicken and water. It was awesome. I was a little disappointed at the cleanliness of the restaurant. The floor was full of bread crumbs and trash  and looked like it had not been swept in days. They need to do better with that!!"}
{"text":"Chain food with homemade bread.   Today's pick 2 was cream of chicken &rice soup and smoked ham & Swiss. 

Good part - the soup was really good.   I would rather see more chickie (especially at this price) but lots of flavor and rice.    The soup is served about 200 degrees, so plan on eating sandwich first.  Seriously ten minutes later,  the soup is still too hot to eat. 

Average part- ham & Swiss on rye without rye.  The country white bread not much flavor.   Of course,  you could really taste the smoke flavor in the ham this way.   They did pile on lots of onions,  maters, and lettuce.   But a little disappointing.   Again,  for $ 6.99 and no drink, this should be best soup and  half sandwich possible. 

Service was excellent and for heavy lunch crowd time waiting wasn't bad.   Decent lunch stop."}
{"text":"Just like all the rest. Really great pastry, good sandwichs and the same décor.  Good place to stop for quick bite.  They didn't have much in soup selection. Tuesday mid-morning may not be best time to visit.  But the staff is extremely friendly"}
{"text":"The moment you come in you feel its time to eat :), usually i have hard time at eating places because the music is too loud and it's too dark inside but I keep loving Panera Bread!!! Never get tired of it :) light breakfast, friendly staff, great food a wonderful way to start the day!!! :)"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Panera's food however I recently downloaded the free app and we tried the rapid pick up option. Not exactly impressive. My fiancé and I ordered two pick two's and half a dozen bagels. When I got to the restaurant there was no bag to pick up on the rapid pick up area? I went to the counter to find that they didn't have 4 of the blueberry bagels I ordered so the manager asked if I was ok to substitute, which I was. I got home only to find that there were only 4 bagels in the bag? I called the store to see if they could refund me for the two missing bagels... Apparently this is not an option for online ordering???? I was told that the only way to refund me is to refund me the entire order. I was however told I could come back to receive the 2 missing bagels and for my inconvenience they would give me a free bakery item... Not a huge fan of the rapid pick up."}
{"text":"Crystal at the front counter was nice and helpful. This is my first Panera experience and I'm pleasantly surprised. The ordering is deli style which I didn't expect. The pastry's are displayed which is definitely my cryptonite. I also ordered a Chai Tea ( one of my favorite drinks) . They did not disappoint in either area."}
{"text":"Panera is great for their soups and sandwiches. At this location, I utilized their touch screen devices to order, and it was super helpful for being able to visualize menu options and prices. It is user-friendly. I opted for the Pick 2 option, choosing a Cup of Chicken Noodle Soup ($3.79) with BBQ Chicken Flatbread ($4.69) for a total of $8.48. The \"Cup\" of soup comes in a bowl if you are dining in. Also comes with either potato chips, fruit, or baguette. I typically opt for the baguette to dip in my soup, especially if I get a creamy soup. While you can't go wrong with good ol' Chicken Noodle Soup, the star of my combo meal was the Flatbread. It was perfectly crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside! It includes Gouda, spinach, chicken, cilantro, and onions (I added caramelized onions) on whole grain bread. I hardly tasted the cilantro. I also wish there was more chicken and spinach. Still, it was tasty. Also shared a delicious Cinnamon Roll ($2.89). It was about the size of my hand!"}
{"text":"Tiny, tiny portions when you order to go compared to when you dine in. The \"you pick 2\" deal comes with a cup of soup and a small salad-which is about half the size of the small salad when you eat inside the restaurant. The deal doesn't include a drink either. Not worth $12.00. Bring back Paradise Bakery!"}
{"text":"Come back later.

This place is tore up from the floor up.  Construction strangles the parking, so good luck with that.

They don't have the screens that let you check the drive through order.  My luck the one time I drive through they mess up my order 

I tend to be very pro on panera, skip this because of macro issues such as Tryon being in shambles."}
{"text":"Disappointed they changed the menu, why change something that was successful already? No more Crumbly Bleu Cheese Salad. Also for the half size salads, they should get smaller bowls. My daughters Caesar filled maybe 1/4 of the bowl, sort of embarrassing for them. AND, I ordered a half also, but I got twice as much salad. Odd. Positive note...they at least have BREAD now to go w/salad. Always thought it odd that a \"bakery\" didn't have bread. 
Overpriced, but fresh."}
{"text":"Slow.   Tells you after you wait 20 min their out of whatever you ordered. When you get the alternative.... order not right.  Can't get these folks to turn around and talk.   So.  Dry turkey and cheese sand....30 min later.  Waste of good money"}
{"text":"Foods always good of course, but there's a young lady here that's got to be the rudest person. Great service and good food as always! But stay away from a brunette young lady with the attitude ! You'll be able to tell right away who I'm talking about trust me."}
{"text":"Great place for Salad and soup with their signature Bread. Straightforward quality  and Menu with excellent service! Great atmosphere and Worth the Drive-Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times but the customer service is absolutely fantastic. They have one employee is very helpful and happy every time I go there. She always has a smile on her face and she genuinely seems to be very happy to be working there. I don't know her name but she's the one with the red hair and gauges in her ears. The food is excellent and reasonably priced. They are quick even during their very busy lunch. Monday through Friday, the line is always to the door but taking that into consideration, the wait isn't too bad. Their Mac and cheese is absolutely amazing! The options when ordering are never ending."}
{"text":"After a major fiasco at Village Inn, my daughter and I were still hungry. She decided Panera Bread would be a good selection. We went to the one at Norterra as it is close to our house. We use to go here when it was Paradise Bakery and no problems. 

I ordered my usual - Fuji apple chicken salad. Panera must have changed the chicken as it did not taste good at all. The lettuce of my salad was also brown (I ended up removing a good portion that was too far gone. So much for being \"fresh\"?!) I was so hungry I ate it anyway. 

We also ordered a cinnamon roll and cinnamon crumb bread to eat later (or in the morning). While my daughter was waiting for me to finish my salad she tried some. She commented on how dry it was that maybe it would be better heated up with a little butter?? Not looking forward to that. 

I eat at the location at 67th Avenue and Beardsley which usually NO problems and the food is good. The Norterra location has gone downhill - WAY downhill!!"}
{"text":"Too many teenagers at register now and orders come out wrong and they are not very friendly at all.  Used to go there all the time but service is not so good anymore.  :-("}
{"text":"From Paradise Bakery to Panera for me was hard. I loved my neighborhood Paradise Bakery due to the menu items. I am not a HUGE fan of the items offered through Panera but in all fairness the Panera concept is nice. They have a variety of soups, salads, pastries, bake goods, soft drinks, coffee and much more. Many similar items that Paradise once had but not all. Especially my favorites like the lemon orzo soup, asian salad and a few other items. 

This location has been updated with modern technology to order your food fast. The staff is super friendly and always helpful. They keep the location clean and fully stocked with condiments. This is a restaurant style location where food is brought to you. I really can't say anything bad about this location. I just missed my favorite menu items that the acquisition removed. 

Now I am a fan favorite of the WARM fresh baked Chocolate Chip Cookie. Yes, you can have fresh out of oven Chocolate Chip Cookies."}
{"text":"Panera is usually a pretty reliable place to stop when traveling, but this location left much to be desired.  The person who waited on us was not friendly at all; a smile or a \"hi\" would have been nice.  The food wasn't up to par, either  There was one small dot of chipotle mayo on my Sierra turkey; guess they were rationing condiments that morning. The pricing structure on the You Pick Two has changed, now each thing is individually priced .  Our lunch was over $18; we drink water.....pretty pricey for a half sandwich with a salad or soup.  Bathroom needed some work as well.  Won't be back here."}
{"text":"Made a pit stop to Panera in Ohio, on our way to New York. I must say, this is one of the largest Panera's I've ever stepped foot in. The fact that it's roomy is a plus. They even have an outdoor patio with a beautiful view to accompany it. Weather was permitting and we enjoyed a delicious lunch outdoors. 

I got the usual: Pick 2 - Fontega Chicken with a bowl of Broccoli Cheddar and an iced Green Tea. Delicious."}
{"text":"This is what you get when you combine Starbucks+food+variety of both = Panera Bread! I loved the place! I tried the cuban panini with Tai tea! to die for! Green ice tea and coffee are great too! This is the perfect place to hang out with friends an dhave a good bite! Totally recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"As with any Panera, the food is very good. 

But, the management and service at this location is seriously below what I've been accustomed to as the normal company standard. 

The coffees are frequently empty and no one seems to know about it behind the counter because I guess they just don't typically check on their supply. Even when the coffee (which, by the way is inferior even to gas station coffee) if full, it is often not fresh. 

There never seem to be enough people working or registers open. It's very slow as a result. 

I'm consistently disappointed."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Hate their chicken noodle soup though."}
{"text":"When you get 5 Starr help. 
When you get 5 Starr smile. 
This place deserve 5 star yelp. 
The Manger here make this place perfect. 
Luke it's the guy. 
All stuff are nice , clean and quick food to your table."}
{"text":"Best note from their staff!! Thanks for having a sense of rumor and being awesome !!!"}
{"text":"Poor service (per usual) and they screwed my order up (again). I'd recommend going to a different location for your panera. Staff is always dismissive and rude. Never pays attention when ordering and it always results in mistakes."}
{"text":"Literally every time we go to this location (in the 4 years we've lived in Charlotte), this Panera doesn't have at least one of the items we order available. Especially with breakfast items like the soufflés. Clearly, they sell quickly, and I'd think that the person in charge might have the foresight to make sure they're kept up with. Service is slow, an overall unimpressive Panera."}
{"text":"Ordered online for pickup or delivery once or twice a month for almost two years and there is ALWAYS something they get wrong. Obviously the staff has trouble following directions even when they're printed in black and white. Don't try to customize anything you order because they will almost always mess it up. It even says on their receipts 'Accuracy matters. Your order should be correct every time. If it's not, we'll fix it right away, and give you a free treat for your trouble.' This isn't always true as at least half of the many, many times they've messed something up, they offer nothing. Their ads pride themselves as having 'clean food', but if you order a salad to go, they put the dressing containers in the box and they are touching your food. You don't know who's been handling those containers or where they've been. We even ordered delivery once, paid the delivery fee, and when we told the driver something they forgot, he just apologized and left. Then I had to drive to the store using my own vehicle - something we PAID to not have to do by ordering delivery in the first place - to walk in and have them correct it. I was offered nothing, and looking back should have asked for a full refund. Never going back to this location. Cannot recommend."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good bagle and cream cheese? Panera's bagels are borderline gourmet! I had a sesame bagel with honey walnut cream cheese this morning and it was dee-lish! I had an early networking meeting here, and we were able to reserve the meeting room for free (plus), AND they have free WiFi (plus plus)! It's in a great somewhat central Pittsburgh location off of McKnight Road - and it was perfect space for our meeting. I'll be seeing you every two weeks!"}
{"text":"Love the drive-thru salad idea. Order an half Asian chicken salad which was very good. Just wish I had order more dressing or the dressing cup size was a little bigger. 
The drive-thru was very fast and asked if I was part of the loyalty program. Which I wasn't, but he told me how to join which I did the next day.
Thanks for such a great experience."}
{"text":"I went to the Crossroads Towne location on a Thursday and there was only 2-3 other individuals in the restaurant at 8:15 am (so they were not busy). The staff at this restaurant are very rude. I ordered a Bear Claw and asked that it be warmed and the rude employee at the front noted I would need to warm the pastry myself if I wanted it warmed. The Bear Claw was very stale and hard (at least 2 weeks old). The microwave at this place is at knee level and the plates they give you with the pastry are not microwave safe. I won't be back. Panera Bread ruined Paradise Bakery when they bought it out. Shame on you!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited in line for 10 mins just so they can tell me that they don't have one of the ingredients for my drink so she had to go get it, knowing that I wanted to cxl my order because I was going to be late to work. When I told her again I wanted to cxl my order she then had to go look for a manager to cxl it. And when the lady I front of me complained for the same reason the cashiers told the manager she was exaggerating. Basically if u want to get something from here, give urself 30 mins, especially if u go in the morning."}
{"text":"This is my new local Panera, as I work across the street.  I eat lunch later than most so if I come after 2 I have no problem getting a table, but any earlier and seriously, good luck!  Service is friendly, but I rarely see anyone cleaning tables so sometimes I roam around till I find a clean spot to relax, eat and read for an hour.  The food is fine, you know what you're getting so no surprises there.  

There is construction going on right next to this spot so I can see that causing some issues with parking and what not.  I walk over so no issues for me."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Panera, it's consistent and prices are pretty reasonable when you consider how much food you are getting, and its possible to eat rather healthy and still be satisfied.

Came on Sunday for a late lunch and it was dead in there.  Got the Pick 2 with 1/2 greek salad and 1/2 chicken noodle soup, whole grain bread as the side...and then to counteract the healthiness of all that I got the chocolate chip cookie!  I mean its Panera's fault, they can't advertise everywhere that any bakery item is 99 cents with the purchase of an entree and drink, and not expect me to succumb to the not so subliminal advertising.  Everything was delish and I cleaned my plates, except I left half of the bread to save room for that yummy cookie!"}
{"text":"Ordered the bakers dozen with 2 cream cheese tubs  brought it home and was missing a bagel. The cream cheeses one expired the day I bought it the other the next day.  Have called twice to speak to the manager with no return phone call. Very poor customer service ."}
{"text":"With so many better options around, why are you wasting your money here?  It's expensive, low quality, and really not very good."}
{"text":"Located down flamingo right before the University of Las Vegas, Nevada, we have Panera Bread. Panera bread never seems to disappoint no matter which location I go to but this one seemed very lackluster. As soon as my friend and I walked in, we weren't greeted whatsoever and so we stood in line waiting but no one was there to assist us. Luckily there was a little kiosk machine that you can self order and customize your order, so I assume that's the new way of ordering from this Panera location? As our food arrived, my friend ordered a bowl of cheese and broccoli soup while I did the half sandwich half soup combo. My friend really enjoyed her meal but my sandwich came out warm and had a green stain on it which could've been avocado (at least I hope so). For my soup I got the chili. I never had a chili I didn't like but this one was a big letdown for me. It didn't taste like chili at all  with all these vegetables and the meat tasting not fresh at all. Throughout our entire meal no one came around to check to see if everything was perfect but not a single employee checked up on any of the tables."}
{"text":"They ALWAYS mess up my order at this location. I have been here about 4 or 5 times and each time they manage to mess up my order. I ask and pay extra to have my eggs scrambled and they never scramble them. But they have no problem charging me for it. Same thing when I order on the app and pay for 2 cookies but they give me one muffie instead. And now this time I finally got my egg scrambled but they ripped me off and only gave me like half the amount of steak they usually do. I'm VERY loyal to Panera, but this location is starting to make me think twice..."}
{"text":"I've met my boss at Panera several times for brief meetings. I don't get the hype around this place. The coffee  is over priced, often times the pots are empty on the floor. The staff is always very nice and accommodating but I couldn't see myself stopping in here just for a cup of coffee or food. I've had a couple sandwhiches here and they were just ok. The one thing in common they all shared was that they were over priced and small. To me its just another big business over charging for everything. I love my mom and pop shops and Panera Bread won't be the one to change that train of thought.

Friendly staff and WIFI are the only things that excite me about Panera."}
{"text":"Cory Smith is an excellent manager with outstanding customer service. My sister had a complain about one of her dishes and he immediately came over to apologize and replace her meal with another soup and then some. Terrific manager!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Panera, and now one has finally opened near Case Western Reserve University. This location just opened, and the staff seems friendly so far. Its clean on the inside, and there is seating on the main floor, as well as the upper floor. I usually do the Pick-2 option, I love getting soup in the bread bowl, the bowl itself is delicious."}
{"text":"I went to Panera frequently (embarrassingly frequently) during my first two years of medical school in Pennsylvania.  Since I moved to Ohio, I haven't been here as often, partly because I'm burned out on it, and partly because there's better options in the neighborhood.  However, every once in a while a craving strikes and I make a visit.

For whatever reason, this location does seem a lot slower than what I've been used to in the past.  This is especially problematic if you're trying to get a coffee and pastry to go in the morning.  Unlike other reviewers, I haven't had any problems with the employees being unfriendly or lazy, just not as quick as I'm accustomed to.  On the bright side, my to-go online orders have always been ready on time.  If you are planning on spending time to work or visit here, timeliness isn't as much of an issue, and then it's not such a bad location.  There are more outlets than I'm used to finding, WiFi works reliably, and the store itself is pretty clean.

I may not be a regular here like I've been in the past, but it's not a bad spot to end up for lunch, especially if you're hungry for tomato soup."}
{"text":"I have been to a number of Paneras in my life. This is the first one I've been to in Madison, WI. This Panera is in a convenient location with lots of parking! 

Very clean and it actually smelled like Apple pie when we entered!

The food came out quick and my Turkey and Avocado sandwich was delicious!!! I definitely will return!"}
{"text":"First time ever and we weren't disappointed!!! We asked what was the most popular sandwiches and soups and came out with the Fontaine chicken, broccoli soup, tomato soup and turkey bacon. Everything was delicious! The staff was ridiculously friendly and everyone seemed to be having \"fun at work\". I will def be back!"}
{"text":"I am so upset right now. I just worked a 13 hour shift and drove a detour from home just to get some Panera. I thought this was going to make me happy at the end of the day, instead it is disappointment. I ordered the pick two with a side of bread. The bread is one of my favorite parts. It was burnt to a crisp and rock solid. I could audibly knock on my bread. Then my sandwich. It was two splashes of half-dollar sized meat. I even \"splurged\" on a drink. My Mac n cheese was good. But I am hungry from my inedible food and $14 down the drain ):"}
{"text":"So disappointed in Panera. Used to be a great place with delicious food, but last three visits to different locations left a lot to be desired. Pretty sad the cost of sandwiches and you get enough of main ingredient too cover MAYBE a quarter of the bread if you're lucky.   Sorry, but a little spoon of the chicken salad, or turkey, or other meat is really disappointing! Must be why I see less and less customers"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that I love Panera. I visit one every time that I am in the US. Needless to say, I was really excited when the chain opened a location in downtown Toronto. I was pretty disappointed when I tried it though. I understand that the place is busy, but I found it really dirty. Also, they were out of a lot of baked goods. The kicker is that the place closed at 10 p.m. on a Friday. That is simply ridiculous."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Panera Bread. The staff at this location are helpful. The food is good, on this particular I ordered the chicken salad sandwich. Normally spot on, it was just okay this time around. It wasn't as good as usual but the customer service made up for it. But as stated before in previous a review, the parking is bad. It's the only thing that prevents me from going to this location more than I do"}
{"text":"Overpriced for small portions. My bowl of mac and cheese wasn't even a full bowl. It was only filled about half way. Wont be back."}
{"text":"The staff was rude. People waited in line while they stood around and chatted. I ordered a grill cheese to go. When I got home, one side was toasted, the other side was bread. Horrible. Get your act together!"}
{"text":"Really Bad food --and bad service.  Orders often wrong. Missed items. Short changed on food portions. Manager Shelby is outright rude and very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Service is typically very slow, regardless if its drive-thru or dine-in. Workers are unenthusiastic and borderline rude. The food typically comes out very sloppily made. It's kept clean, which is probably the best thing about this particular Panera. The convenience of its location is nice but if you're looking for your food to be done well, timely, and with any type of positive service, I suggest a different Panera or restaurant."}
{"text":"P-Bread as it's called in my inner circle is a nice little Panini/Sandwich restaurant/bakery around the Las Vegas are.

Most locations offer fresh bread and pastries daily that tend to be excellent.  They usually offer WIFI and make a great place to grab a casual/business lunch."}
{"text":"I have been in training the past couple weeks in Monroeville and they have been extremely fast and tasty each time. While the prices I believe are a little high for fast food, it's no different than any other Panera.

This resturant brings in extra staff around lunch too so they have been super accommodating as well as cleaning off the tables, as well as bussing the table!! That's a first I've seen at a fast food joint!"}
{"text":"I like eating here because the food is always fresh and made to order. The menu is large, offering breakfast, sandwiches, soups, flat breads and salads. They always add limited time season food too. My favorite is the strawberry salad usually offered spring and summer. 
This place is great to catch up with friends and eat a healthy lunch. Employees walk around and pick up your dishes too. Gives it more of a restaurant feel."}
{"text":"The manager was so nice,  she helped me order an item that I once had that wasn't on the online menu among a few other things today. The Walnut Chicken Sandwich and Thai Chicken Salad was wonderful, thank you!!"}
{"text":"Fresh sandwiches, salads, soups... and cookies!

I'm a big fan of paradise bakery. Consistently a good choice for lunch or dinner. I order the Pick 2: Half Sandwich/half salad. Or soup. I think you can get pasta too. The Bacon Turkey Bravo and the Paradise Club are my favorite sandwiches and the best part is they're served with a guilt free cookie. It's like whoops, I guess I HAVE to eat this cookie that came free with my sandwich. 

The salads are big too. The Fuji Apple is excellent, but I've been impressed with everything I've tried. They load you up with lots of fruit and mix it up in front of you. 

Also, in case you didn't know, PB is in the same family as Panera Bread. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"After I had eaten here I went back through the other reviews for this location and I am glad that I am not alone when it comes to having a bad experience here.  And I can see why so many fellow Pittsburgh Yelpers really do not like this place.

I showed up here because I had some time to kill before I headed to work and I wasn't in the mood for fast food.  When I entered I was hit by a noise wall that was extremely loud.  So loud that when it came to ordering I was basically shouting my order to the employee behind the register.

After ordering I proceeded to the pick up area and just waited, I'd rather do that when I am dining alone.  Once the order was placed on the counter and my name was called I became disappointed.  When I was yelling my order to the register girl I had said that I wanted the pick two combo, half tomato mozzarella Panini and mac n cheese.  When I picked up my plate what I got was my Panini and half a ham and cheese.  o_O  Mac n cheese does not equal ham and cheese.  And I ended up with a piece of baguette even though I said I did not want it.  Who wants that much bread on one plate?  The only thing I got right in this order was the lemonade.  I didn't even argue because I know that I wouldn't have been heard anyway.

When I got to the table, or should I said crumb top table, I was disgusted.  I really didn't even want to eat my food.  I know you are busy, but have one of the twenty or so employees prepping food come out and wipe down the tables that are recently emptied.  In fact, I really didn't eat my food, I more like picked at it.  One bite of the Panini and I was done, especially when I came across a nut that I'm pretty sure didn't belong in there.

I attempted there sad interpretation of a bathroom and left feeling even more dirty that I had when I stepped in there.  If I want Panera, I'll head to a different location, never this one again.  It is obviously the worst in this city."}
{"text":"This use to be my go to Panera Bread.  When I worked in the area I would stop here before work to grab my breakfast and then stop to get my lunch as well.  I was happy when I left the area and moved on to bigger and better things.  My waist also appreciated it.  Those scones are delicious.

I recently stopped back here when I was shopping and was pleasantly surprised.  With all my new allergies I came in here hoping to get some bread.  Not knowing, nor doing my homework before I showed up, I asked the manager if one particular bread had corn syrup in it or not.  Not knowing the answer herself, she was kind enough to pull out a binder that contained all of their recipes, ingredients included.  After looking through it for a few minutes I was able to select the bread I wanted.  They will sliced the bread thick or thin for you there right now.  If you would rather slice yourself, I am sure they will wrap it up and you can go on your way.  Yes, it's true, it may be a bit more expensive than your cheap bread on the grocery store shelf.  But it is much better tasting."}
{"text":"I find myself at this panera bread a lot because it's close to my work.  I was never a big fan of Panera bread in the past.  I think it is because we would always go for dinner and I don't think this is the best dinner place.  Like I mentioned I try to run in and out of this place when I need to grab something that ins't fried or a burger.  I always order the Turkey Bravo sandwich.  This is a big sandwich and tasty too! 
Here's what I don't like so much with this Panera bread.  The kids at the cash register are a littl slow.  I mean \"slow\" in a few different ways.  I try to run in and run out, but there always seems to be a line.  I know what you are thinking that I probably go during a lunch rush.  This is not the case because my lunch is at 3ish during the week.  I'm sure they are trying to the best they can, but they need to move it along.  
Overall I enjoy Panera because the food always taste fresh and it reasonably priced.  So, go enjoy a turkey bravo sandwich when you get a chance. Oh and the other stuff is good too.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Needing a quick lunch after running around all day I decided to stop here.  I was lucky to have stopped at the time I did because there was virtually no one in here making for quick service.  It didn't take long from the time that I ordered to the time that I received my food.  

That is the thing that didn't make me happy here.  I had ordered the mac n cheese and broccoli cheddar soup.  However both of them seemed watered down.  Although I hate the baguette it was necessary for this meal.  It was able to sop up all that watery mess.  

The saving grace of this meal was the lemonade.  I enjoy a good lemonade and Panera delivers there all the time."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Panera in a long time.  To me, things have changed a bit, from at least how I knew it.  After a day of running around the area with my parents we decided we needed to eat something.  My parents are a bit particular about trying something outside their comfort zone.  So they favored with going with something familiar to them.

Can't really write anything new about the food or atmosphere for Panera Bread, but what I can touch on is how service is here.  From what I remember in the past it was mostly a self serve type of setting.  By that, you pick up your own food once your coaster vibrated.  Now, it appears that your food is brought to your table and you don't have to decide whether to stand there or find a table and go back.  Kind of a nice touch as it is quicker.  But then you realize that the staff that is serving your food is less than enthusiastic.  

Panera is a belly filler.  But not a place I would constantly visit."}
{"text":"I usually love Panera, but this location specifically always messes up my boyfriend and my order. He is allergic to mustard and they always put mustard or something with mustard in it after we tell them. Yes they always fix it but we had to send it back twice because it was not even fixed the first time we sent it back. I had the Greek salad and it was disgusting and it smelt bad. So yes, very disappointed."}
{"text":"The usual Panera. My fave is their bagel selection. Very soft and yeasty; perfect for that AM carb load."}
{"text":"This is one of the busiest, yet, accommodating Paneras I have been to. Their portions are much larger (specifically the pick 2 Salads) than other Panera locations in PGH."}
{"text":"Second time here.  This is not up to the standard of other Panera's I have frequented.  Coffee pots not full and lukewarm coffee.  Perhaps this was the holiday crew, but my cashier looked to have been fired from the \"Watch me do my job in slow-motion store.\"  If I don't want the receipt,  please throw it out rather than insisting on pushing it into my hand."}
{"text":"We enjoy the healthy food, with tasty options. We also appreciate the WiFi access with electricity.  The facility was clean and the staff was very pleasant to work with."}
{"text":"Nice to see that Panera is the same here in Madison WI. Good quality food, very nice employees. This is a fairly busy location but they move people through rather quickly."}
{"text":"Another Broken Egg we go to Panera fairly often. I had the half sandwich with their strawberry salad. Sandwiches large very fresh and tasty. The salad was perfect. My wife had a large chicken lime salsa salad. It was extremely large and she love you. Would definitely go back to Canal."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick bite to eat in the morning, I found that the atmosphere is good for studying. One of the big downsides is that the internet speed is really slow, so it makes working on your laptop next to impossible."}
{"text":"I love Panera! The soups and salads are pretty good - you can't go wrong. Baked goods and pastries are really tasty as well. You get a lot of choices, which are all really tasty for a very good price. Service here was excellent; I also like that you can substitute a lot of things without having to pay extra.

This is the closest Panera to my place that has free parking so I will definitely be back.

Good for: lunch, dinner, snacks"}
{"text":"I love my local panera! They get my order right 99% of the time, staff is friendly. Use rapid order to avoid the wait during peak hours."}
{"text":"Their tea was delicious. The other day I came fire their iced coffee and they just gave you a cup. It was disappointed since I was hoping they would make it for me since I'm paying for it. I'll stick to their teas instead."}
{"text":"Don't come here, they don't want your business. We visit Panera bread everywhere but in our backyard, this location is a joke.  Waited for 15 minutes after ordering and no one seemed to be moving, except the kid that was sweeping around our feet while we were waiting for takeout. Where oh where is the management at this location?"}
{"text":"Solid lunch delivered in minutes. Med chicken flatbread and Greek salad. Iced tea. Polite if impersonal service."}
{"text":"good food, but every single time i call to place an order, they make me wait when i get there.  every single time!  one time, the order wasn't even put in and i was late to work.  unacceptable.  i even give them a time frame and they can't have the food ready."}
{"text":"Hey Panera! You should probably take your cashier \"Sarah\" off your payroll asap! Quite possibly the most rude food service employee I've came across. 
Food, as always is typical Panera, hard to mess up. They are \"now hiring\" I might put a add up for them so I don't get treated like dirt next time ;)"}
{"text":"This Panera isn't the best to go to. The parking lot is big, but a mess. It's in a shopping center and people zoom though so be careful when walking inside. Once inside,the staff that I've experienced is very cold and uninviting. Unknowledgeable, and uncaring. The cleanliness of this location needs some help but if you want to go to a Panera this is the only one in Monroeville. It's worth the drive to go into the newer Panera in Murrysville"}
{"text":"I had a meeting nearby for work so went here for lunch. It beats all the other sub and sandwich chains to death. The place is huge. It's clean. The staff didn't seem to hate their jobs even though there was a fairly long line. The line moved fast. The prices threw me off at first. When I paid $6.99 for a simple turkey sandwich I thought I was being a little ripped off when I could have found a $5 footlong. Then I found out I got an apple with it. I was sold. I fiend for apples. I got the sandwich back to work and was so impressed with the bread. From what I understand it's semi-made-in-store but whatever, it was the freshest sandwich bread I can remember having in a long, long, time. There was also a very fair portion of turkey. The food was simple but made so right. I think I'll be putting this place into my lunch rotation even though it's a little out of the way of my usual stomping grounds."}
{"text":"Great salads, and gimger tea. Large dining room, seat yourself, order at the counter, food ready when buzzer vibrates and lights up. Great for groups, or small gatherings. Casual atmosphere"}
{"text":"This Panera's wifi is shittier than the dial-up Internet I had in the 90's.  Don't come here if you're planning on doing work on your laptop.

The food itself is pretty decent.  My fav. is their Thai Chicken Salad.  I like the fact that you can get an apple as a side and make other healthy substitutions.  I got their Green Passion Power Smoothie once too.  It tasted pretty good, but it was pretty sweet so they must've dumped a buttload of sugar into it.

At least 50% of ppl come here to do some work, so get your shit together, Panera, and fix your wifi!"}
{"text":"A big, beautiful wonderful Panera. It is spacious with plugs aplenty. I sat there for a couple of hours waiting on my husband. There were lots of places to sit, lots of light, good places for groups or those killing some time like me."}
{"text":"This location is becoming very slow and rude , waited 5-10mins for a lemonade agave which should not take long to make when I looked around the counter everybody was standing around talking. No welcome to Panera or anything very rude and inattentive."}
{"text":"Can't say I enjoyed the homeless gentleman who fashioned a makeshift tent and made a table his temporary residence during lunch today. But at the same time I can't say I didnt enjoy it, either."}
{"text":"I love panera. Order it online for the conveinance. Except every single time something is wrong with my order. Sauce on my sandwich that's not supposed to be on. No avacado. Avacado including the rind. The list goes on and on. Today I only got half of my sandwich untoasted when it was supposed to be a full sandwich toasted. And my boyfriend got no steak on one half of his panini. I get it, I work in the food industry, you get rushes sometimes. That doesn't mean you can't read an order right, I'd rather wait for my order than have to come back. It's literally been at least 10 times now that my order was wrong. this is the only panera in the area so I can't even go somewhere else. Either train your employees to read or hire employees who know how to."}
{"text":"This is my favorite soup and sandwich spot but lately they've been slipping and today was the worst. I'm glad I pay an arm and a leg for a sandwich that was half assed."}
{"text":"I have to start off by saying I hate to give places a low rating, but I have been here several times and each time has been a diappointment. The only reason I didn't give only 1 star is because the place is new and clean. When the weather warms up, there will be a nice outdoor eating area as well.

This Panera is within walking distance from my house, so Hubs and I have tried it on 3 different occassions. Every single time, something is wrong or missing from our order. Every. Time. I ordered a bread bowl with chili and a baguette for dinner and both the bread bowl and baguette were missing! If you put any special instructions or modifications, don't expect them to happen. Another time, I got a bagel and cream cheese. the cream cheese ramikan was half empty and they charge you $1.30 for it! They did give me more when I asked for it free of charge, but that is just a rip off.

Everyone there is really nice, don't get me wrong. And I realize it's a newer establishment, but they have got to get it together in the kitchen."}
{"text":"excellent service, excellent food. best of all the manager is so professional, courteous, kind & helpful. bree our waitress so pleasant, cordial & friendly. thank you for hiring such a wonderful manager & staff .alexandra was so patient & helpful to my deaf son who was ordering several things & wanted to ask her a few questions. loved everything ! will definitely frequent your establishment many times. alexandra & bree should be acknowledged. great asset to your restaurant. thank u!"}
{"text":"Very good. Everybody friendly. Quick service. Our food Great. Table next to us had a problem with their order. It was handled excellent and people even got free cookie. Only problem I noticed. They were slow in cleaning tables off"}
{"text":"Outside looks small. Inside-lots of room-homey and above average of other Paneras we have stopped at. Staff super friendly. Super Clean. And of course food hot and great tasting"}
{"text":"Stopped in twice this trip to UPMC. Struck out 2x. Worst Panera we have ever stopped at. First grilled cheese was \"burnt\" on bottom. Hard as rock. Manager was nice and gave money back. 
Next day lunch-coffee med warm-ugh.  New chicken green salad was terrible. I loved the old Asian Chicken Salad I loved
Store is only about 5? Years old but looking worn and little dirty. Sorry Panera"}
{"text":"Just went to this Panera for lunch and was extremely disappointed. I love both Panera and Paradise Bakery but this one is not worth stopping at. I ordered their seasonal turkey apple cranberry sandwich. The lady at the register told me they were out of the cheese for that sandwich so she gave me other options which was fine! I proceeded to wait for my order for about 10 minutes when they called me up and told me they did not have the apples for the sandwich and if I wanted to pick somethings else. The restaurant was not busy so I'm not sure why it took so long for them to tell me that. I went back to look at the menu and picked out another sandwich to get. Once I told them it took another 10 minutes to make it. When I finally got my sandwich a lady called my name and did not even apologizing for not having the sandwich I had originally ordered or thanking me for waiting. Will not return to this location."}
{"text":"This Panera is horrible unless you like eating paper and getting your order correct on the 3rd try.  I ordered 2 bagels, 1 coffee, 1 soda and a muffin to go at 10:30am on a Saturday.  I walk to get my soda and the lady tells me they have no more bagels.  I say \"that's ok, let's start over\" but her response was \"it's only a few dollars difference\" which struck me as odd as I hadn't offered any replacement suggestions yet.  I say \"let's do 2x bacon egg and cheese on croissants\".  I start to get my coffee and she tracks me down again and says \"We don't have croissant\".  I say, \"that's ok, how about ciabatta, and do you know when there will be any coffee put out on this Saturday morning\"? She takes my cup and says she will bring me some.  The coffee jugs are brought out and set up, I ask for my cup back and the she says she'll get it for me in just a second.  They bring me my sandwiches on plates, I ask if they can have them wrapped up, and if they know where my coffee cup is, and if they know where my muffin is?  I'm brought my coffee cup by the girl who took it and she tells me they set up coffee out here, I thank her for the update.  I have everything but my muffin however the same lady throughout was kind enough to ignore me for only a minute before she stopped to ask what she can get me.  Eventually I am home with my muffin, two sandwiches, coffee and soda, I take my first bite of my sandwich and the wax paper from the cheese was still in it.  This Panera is horrible and it made me sad when it ruined my breakfast."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Panera Bread!

This location is very clean with friendly staff. Last time I went I just had a bowl of Broccoli Cheddar soup and Don had a tuna salad sandwich. Our orders came out right away. The Broccoli Cheddar soup was a little thick, but still very tasty with the bread that came with it. I'm glad they serve it daily because it's my favorite soup. The tuna salad sandwich tasted SO fresh and the red onion and lettuce gave it a very nice crunch. Our meals were very simple, so there's not much else to say, but pleasant service + clean restaurant + good food makes me a fan!"}
{"text":"Quick service, free refills, wi-fi, great food.  Bathrooms are sparkling clean.  Rapid pick-up is available at this location as well as front door ordering capable.  Very clean dining area along with seating outside too."}
{"text":"I was sorry to see this Panera Bread close.  It was so close to my house--right around the corner in fact.  Yes there are a lot of great local places in Squirrel Hill and I always prefer patronizing locally-owned businesses.  Still, for an impromptu lunch out with my girlfriends and/or my cousin, it wasn't a bad choice.  And I did like their breads.

I also liked their soups, including low fat chicken noodle and low fat vegetarian black bean.  Oh well, I guess I can always go to the one in Homestead."}
{"text":"My cousin and I stopped here on Sunday after hiking at nearby Settler's Cabin Park.  Since it was a wonderfully brisk Sunday morning and we just hiked about 6 miles or so, I was in the mood for some really good soup. Nothing else sticks to the ribs after getting the old blood pumping on a morning like this!  

I opted for the soup & 1/2 a sandwich combo.  I went for the cream of chicken & wild rice soup, which was so good.  The 1/2 a smoked ham & swiss sandwich was decent enough.  The soups are the best items on the menu here.  Otherwise there's nothing to distinguish Panera from any other bread place like Cosi, Corner Bakery, Einstein Bagels, etc.

Keep in mind, there are two Paneras within a couple of miles of each other:  this one and the one in Robinson Town Center."}
{"text":"Yeah, I know.  It's a typical chain place.  No better, no worse than Einstein Bagels, Corner Bakery etc.  But after a day of hiking at nearby Boyce Park, my cousin Cindy and I decided to stop and get a bite to eat.  There are three Paneras in close proximity along Route 22 (William Penn Highway):  this one, one in Wilkins Township, and one in Murrysville.  

I have to admit I do like their soups here.  I had a delicious Low Fat Vegetarian Black Bean Soup, with a side of Country Artesian Bread.  As any diabetic (like me) or anyone interested in nutrition can tell you, \"Low-Fat\" does not necessarily translate into \"Low Calorie\".  Still, their website says that the soup is 200 calories per serving, but I'm just wondering how many \"servings\" per bowl?

But the soup sure was good after a day out in the park!  The coffee was pretty good too.  So a place like this really fills the bill at times."}
{"text":"I am giving them 0 stars, but had to put one in there or it would not allow me to continue. I called to ask the manager of the Tempe, AZ location a question. Somehow I got some schmuck in customer service who flat out refused to patch me through to the Tempe location on Guadalupe Road until I told him specifically what I was calling for. What a jerk! I called back and I could not get through pressing option 5 (to the manager) until I unblocked my number. Boy, these people are unreal! I don't think I should have to display my number, but I did since it appears it is one of many of their stupid inconvenient rules. I got Samantha on the phone was was very rude and not helpful at all. I asked her for the corporate number and she refused to give it to me; she said she would only give me the \"customer service\" line, which would put me through to more schmucks! I asked her who is over her; she gave me a name, but again, refused to tell me how I could get in contact with that person. Not only are the people rude, and could care less about the customer, they have cheapened their food, call it \"healthy\" when it is loaded with so much sodium it could kill an elephant, but they charge far too much and only give you appetizer portions, hence, I do not recommend this place, and certainly do not recommend this location. Their staff wears gloves, but picks up the trash, handles money and opens doors in the back, with their gloves still on; very un-sanitary. 10 thumbs down, and less than 0 stars."}
{"text":"Hurray for a little piece of paradise... thanks  to Paradise for honoring my 3 year old free sandwich coupon  and giving me my scrambled egg breakfast for free. You get mucho points for class in my book! 

Glad your in Norterra , you are an oasis !"}
{"text":"Oh good another Paradise Location for meeting up with friends after work. Clean neat and well manned , the worker bees seemed in real force, cleaning refilling and picking up plates. Nice to see. 
Food wasn't quite paradise but it was tasty and filling . I usually have the panini with chicken and artichoke but today went for a Chicken wrap.Tasted like a chicken wrap.  The peach decaf teas was refreshing and the mango tea was too. 
I love the casualness of the setting and the ease with which you can order at your leisure . If you are meeting people with different time constraints , this can be very helpful."}
{"text":"The best thing about Panera is the mobile app. You can avoid the line and sit at your table to order & pay from the app and have the food brought out as usual. Ordering takeout on the app is a pleasure as well. The food is consistently good, on par with Cafe Zupas and Wildflower. On the downside, you can't get any crackers with your soup (how is that, and how easy would that be to fix??), the great iced tea flavors are gone, soup flavors are not there all the days, the outside patio isn't cleaned enough, and the managers don't really seem to care about fixing these items. And it's not Paradise Bakery. I almost never rave about apps, but Panera's is the gold standard and keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"I used to love going to Panera Bread in the Midwest. But something has changed over the intervening years since I've moved out West. They have changed up the menu, I get that, always trying to improve. The problem is that I haven't found my go to sandwich. After three tries you're out Panera. I had the Chicken Frontega and it was so so at best. I left a little hungry after spending over 11 dollars for a grilled sandwich and a soda."}
{"text":"\"Chain, chain, chain...  Chain of food...\"

There are good chain restaurants and not-quite-so good ones.  Panera does a better-than-most job; I'm pretty sure you already know how it works:  You order, they give you the square, marquee-like pager, you find a table, the pager goes off like the Rabbit Vibrator on \"squeal\" mode, and you fetch your own grub. (After, you are expected actually to bus your OWN table.  How very egalitarian.  And cheap.)

So going in you get the plan.  Tasty, some downright healthy food, freshly made, hot or cold as the dish demands, with you providing the after-kitchen labor.

THIS particular Panera isn't quite up to par with the others I've tried.  I'm on my seventh or eighth meal here, at different times of day, yet I seem to get the same treatment.  Uninterested service.  Uninspired service.  In fact, the only person here who WAS doing their job was ME!  I bussed that booth like I was bucking for manager, baby!

Here's a modern-day employee quirk that just sends me into a funk:  The guy or gal, while standing right in front of you, starts complaining.  \"I was supposed to get off at three today because Biff was taking me for a mani-pedi because we were heading to Hilton Head...\"  And on on on on...  It happens in banks, in restaurants, it may even happen at funeral homes.  For the love of Bourdain, could that wait until I at least have my meal?  I don't stop in the middle of my order and tell you about my open, weeping sore, now do I?  

Food is pretty good, as it nearly always is in the Panera empire.  Fix the whiny worker part and you'll get at least one more star.  Leave it all broke down and busted and I may not come back, no matter how good  the salads and sammies."}
{"text":"It's freezing, there's a lack of parking, the staff is overwhelmed and I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love Panera and the food in this location is great. However, I must say that the service sucks!!! They are such idiots who work at this location, stuck up, and expect only college students to eat here. The staff looked at me like I was crazy since I wasn't in college. Also, I see the employees' here texting, being unprofessional, and not even working! I would give this 5 stars if the people who work here would do their job. I had even asked why they don't put out napkins and I never see any of the staff putting out napkins, straws, or anything like that when they run out of napkins and I always have to ask them for napkins and they just give me a weird look. I don't recommend anyone going to this location if you rather have professional workers!!"}
{"text":"I was all excited to try the southwest Chile chicken salad. 
The chicken was \"suspect\" no flavor with a rubbery texture. The avocado was too ripe. I had to eat around the chicken. I was impressed with the amount of tortilla chips throughout the salad and the flavor of the salad dressing was good. The best part of the meal was the bread. I suppose I will stick up ordering soup!"}
{"text":"No stars unfriendly staff, they were out of bread bowls, cold bland soup (baked potato) I had to wipe my own table to sit, lemonade was ok other than that a big fail."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Convenient if not great. Food is okay but very pricey. 
Soup and salad are probably best. Sandwiches,,, well we are seeing sparse portions of meats and cheeses, compared to what made them good and popular in the first place. I stopped getting most sandwiches because of that. I do like most of the soups but boy are they expensive for the portion size."}
{"text":"10 am.  No breakfast crowd. No lunch crowd.  2 people in line.  Ordered breakfast sandwich took 15 minutes. While I watched people in kitchen rub faces and hair repeatedly.  All kinds of trash on ground in kitchen Dropped utensils on ground picked up without cleaning. 3 coffee carafes empty. Trash on tables. There were ALOT of people working. Decided against eating the sandwich, asked for refund. This is only Panera I have ever seen like this. It was gross"}
{"text":"Nothing negative about Panera.   Great food and service.   Just no free cookie....like the ones in the southwest!"}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars I would!! Has to be the worst location that Panera has. Absolutely so dissatisfied. Will definitely not order from here again. So sad the employees dont know how to make a Asian chicken salad.. very disappointed. And it's not a very cheap place. They could've at least made my food correct!!!! I did pay!"}
{"text":"I haven't had Panera in like a year and tonight I am so disappointed.. I asked the cashier if their French onion soup came like a regular French onion soup with the bread and cheese on top. She told me yes so I ordered one on my Pick 2 combo with a Turkey Apple Sandwich. I look at my receipt and see I'm charged $4 for a half soup and $6 for a half sandwich which I think is pretty high for HALF a sandwich so I was a little annoyed but whatever. I figured I'd probably feel more content after I finished my meal. I get home and see that there is no cheese at the top of my soup, it came with croutons like the tomato soup does and at the bottom of the cup is a glob of partial melted cheese  melted by the heat of the soup. My sandwich looked like a 1/3 of a regular sandwich that you could get anywhere else. The \"Apple\" in the Turkey Apple sandwich was a nasty slaw mixture that made the bottom bread super soggy, gross and almost impossible to hold. I asked for my sandwich pressed and only part of the crust had grill marks. I don't think I'll be returning. You've gone downhill Panera"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Took them over 30 minutes to refill the coffee pot.. Still sitting here waiting actually. 

Panera sucks why did I come here."}
{"text":"This is a cute little panera. Good location right off the highway. Unfortunately they don't have a drive thru though. Every time I have come here (even during lunch) it's not that busy which is nice because I don't want to wait in line for a sand which or pastry. I felt like coming here for breakfast- never had panera for breakfast. The eggs hire spinach avacado flatbread had two giant tomatoes on it which I don't like at all- tomatoes wasn't on the menu. This was basically the whole sandwhich so I returned it and left :/"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here and I'm a little confused as to the large number of negative reviews. The staff was polite and pretty speedy. They didn't make any mistakes on my order and there were lots of spots to sit. I used to love going to panera in Florida and this one is so far up to that standard. 

I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup pick 2, the grilled cheese was excellent, the tomato soup was acceptable. It was a bit more tomatoey than basil flavored. I also had an iced chi which was incredible! 

I did spend some time observing the staff and they do look like they are not too experienced but the manager came out and helped when there was a little rush at 2pm. 

I have no real complaints, I will be back."}
{"text":"The only reason we come to this location is to watch the employees fight with each other. They have this one older lady who is always yelling at the other employees for messing stuff up. It's pretty entertaining. Other than that, the pastries are always stale and the portion sizes have decreased. Seriously, how hard is it to make a chocolate chip cookie. Someone bring back Paradise Bakery"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, it's alright for a quick lunch with friends or by yourself. When I order a pasta dish they ask what type of bread I want on the side, which makes sense to me. But when I got my meal, the bread was stale as hell, as if it had been sitting out for days. And this has happened multiple times. Considering this place is called Panera BREAD, I would assume the bread would be fresh.
That being said, everything else I got has been quite good, like the tortellini alfredo, pesto sacchettini, and wild berry smoothie.
Give it a try, but don't expect much from the bread itself."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 3 times now, and have sent my food back to them all
3 times.  I ordered, what I thought was an Udon soup once, and it looked like beef broth, and
smelled like the garbage dumpster.

Went there this past Thursday, and ordered a tuna sandwich. I asked the cashier what was on it, prior to ordering, and he said lettuce and tomato.  I ordered a half of the sandwich, on plain white bread, with the lettuce and tomato on the side. Waited for 14 minutes, all the while, watching the people preparing the sandwiches working at the pace of a snail. 

I was given a bag, and checked it immediately. I received a scoop of tuna on a ciabatta bread, with ONIONS on top of the scoop of tuna. (the tuna had not been spread onto the bread, just there in a scoop in the middle of this large, thick ciabatta bread.)  I gave it back to the cashier, asking for a refund. How is this so hard to make a simple 1/2 of a tuna salad sandwich with the lettuce and tomato on the side.  Incidentally, there was NO lettuce or tomato in the bag on the side, either.

My husband had ordered a turkey sandwich with nothing on it, and the \"special sauce\" on the side.  You guessed it....sauce, lettuce, tomato and onions on his sandwich. 
Unbelievable.  This is not brain surgery. It is simple sandwiches.

There were so many people waiting in front of the serving station, waiting for their food, that
we all started laughing about what could possibly take so long.

Needless to say, we returned the order, and have no intentions of EVER returning to this location. They have had several opportunities to serve good food correctly ordered.  Three
strikes, you're OUT!  Sorry McCandless Panera.

Oh, yeah, and the manager's lame excuse for this was, \"we have a lot of new people making the sandwiches\".  Not a good answer, M'am, If they can't make a simple tuna sandwich, they need more training from YOU, or they shouldn't be here at all."}
{"text":"I just got a hot tea and to be there with friends. Gkkd easy service and welcoming atmosphere"}
{"text":"I've been known to eat at Panera for both breakfast and lunch, many times. I don't know what it is about this place but the food (for what it is) is pretty damn good!  Service is usually top notch and the food quality seems good.  I'm a little hesitant about their cafe drinks (frozen caramel, lattes, etc) as every time I have one I get an upset stomach. Only complaint is the tables/booths should be cleaned more thoroughly...nothing chaps my ass more than having to clean my table and chair/booth before sitting down."}
{"text":"As far as bread company / lunch places go this place is high on my list.  I can confidently know that just about anywhere I am there is a Panera and I can rely upon the consistency of their offerings.  I've spent quite a small fortune at these places over the years and don't see my wallet getting any heavier anytime soon.  This location is pretty new and is located in Boca Park down by Kona Grill, Cheesecake Factory, Total Wine and REI.

I posted a pic that I find amusing...802.11B wifi available?!?!?  Holy smokes that's so 1999.  Really 11 megabits?  Can we at least get g up in here...you're a few revisions behind guys :-)

Parking at this location can be a bit of a challenge due to its location in the Boca Park strip mall and people using the spaces for other businesses...worth a bit of a walk in my opinion though."}
{"text":"Typically love Panera, was very disappointed in the quality and service at this specific location. When asking for dietary accommodations such as extra cinnamon crumbles, my needs were not met! Along with my burnt bagel (image attached), the smoothies were far too watery. Sad! Will miss coming to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"16 minute wait in drive thru with only 2 cars in front of me. The guy made me repeat my order twice cause he said he forgot for my 2   items. Car in front of me was asked to move up he waited 6 mins and gave up he did not even wait for the coffee he paid for. Took them 5 mins to just acknowledge me at the window. Got my sandwich and he asked if I wanted cream and sugar I said yes. And now I'm drinking black coffee."}
{"text":"Great food, its clean.  Parking lot is a pot holed third world parking nightmare.  Not sire if they have any control over it but there are shopping carts scattered about and cars swallowed up whole by the holes in the pavement.

Otherwise my bacon turkey bravo was awesome.  Restrooms need more monitoring during heavy usage times.  They bus tables quickly though."}
{"text":"I've been to Panera Bread before, and this one really isn't too different then other Panera Bread stores. The ordering process is the same, the food tasted the same which is a good thing because there's consistency that you expect when going to Panera Bread. I don't feel I need to give a review on the food because the food was enjoyable it's what I expected it was warmer it needed to be crunchy where needed to be spicy where it needed to be in tasty where needed.

My only real gripe is that although they use metal spoons and silverware, my spoon was so disgustingly dirty, I don't know how they could've wrapped it in a napkin or set it out for use, without seeing the mounds of old cheese and soup junk that was left on it. Super huge big problem, as a spoon up in the manager apologized and swapped it out for a clean one, but still if you're going to offer silverware please make sure its clean."}
{"text":"Terrible management. Stopped in for a breakfast souffle. Didnt have any ready.  Offered me one from last night.  Looked old. Said they sold out.  Doubtful as case was completely empty. Said it would be 40 minutes.  Wont be back."}
{"text":"Beware of the fly in the salads... #nasty... \" I will give you a free meal\" how about I just not eat there again... Bad Paradise Bakery!  This company will not order from you again!"}
{"text":"I just had one of the worst experiences I have ever had using Panera.  I walked in and ordered two bagel packs that I take for clients.  

First off, the associate trainer Katie helped me.   She barely acknowledged me, she acted as if I I positioned her and just walked away from me after ordering with out even saying a thing.   Acting frustrated she thee the bagels around behind the counter.  Knocking signs off the bagels.   

I will never revisit this store despite all my rewards points."}
{"text":"Update since last review:
Wrote both the cooperate office and the GM of this location going into detail the series of issues we have had over the past couple months. Not a single reply."}
{"text":"Wow....its just like a regular Panera just at a stop on the I90 expressway....

I swear there were \"locals\" in here just for lunch...even though it is on the tollway.....

Anyway the food is great and so is the service........

Hot chocolate chip cookie!!!

U pick 2: Chx Ndl, Smokehouse Turke

Total = $8.75"}
{"text":"Only reason they get 1 star is because there is not a option for NO STARS.....I'm a very frequent Panera Bread Customer... however I just moved to the Matthews area and this location is the closest one to me... I ordered  a EGG WHITE, SPINCAH, and sausage sandwich on wheat bread... I waited 20 mins for the food... for it to be completely wrong!! Told the manager CORIE or CORY.. I explained to her that the sandwhich was incorrect.. expecting that she will just fix it or AT LEAST a APOLOGY! She immediately offered a refund... no apology no nothing!! Wasted 45 mins of my time for HORRIBLE SERVICE. I have been a manager for 8 years and she was not empathetic at all! I went to my car and decided that I will contact corporate... I called the cafe I just left 0774 Matthews location spoke with Cory AGAIN... still NO APOLOGY! Stated to her that I needed corporates phone number....lord behold this young lady tries to slide a slick one pass me and give me HELP DESK PHONE NUMBER! I don't know is she thinks that I don't have common sense or what not! I contacted corporate myself... and informed them of the situation... the lady I spoke with was appalled and very empathic. I will never go to this location again!!! I was late to work and frustrated at the same dang time!  I've never experienced service like this from anywhere! Then again this is 2017. Companies will hire anyone nowadays ...  I will Be contacting corporate again to make sure the issue is rectified! Cory has found the right one to play with :)"}
{"text":"I love tho place for any time of day. I love the you pick two because you don't just have to pick one thing  you can have a little bit of both. I am aways there for coffee an paninis.the price is okay for lunch and dinner. The breakfast is quick, easy, and cheap if you are in a hurry or are in a rush, even when you just want to hang out and read the news paper it is just a chill kind of place. Every time the staff is so nice, if their is a problem they will fix it immediately. The lunch/ dinner menu is great, even if you are on a diet or a vegetarian. Great place to go for every lifestyle and every time of day!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I visited here the other day upon recommendation of my sister and I was pleasantly surprised. The food was fantastic and the people were very sweet! I will 100% be back for another visit! Now I will be recommending this place to my friends!"}
{"text":"This location is not like the other places. They ran out of espresso so only decaf is available then bagels are out so we ordered sandwiches then after waited 15 min the order still came out wrong."}
{"text":"I can never make up my mind here especially with that Pick Two thing. By the time I get to the counter I just spin around, cover my eyes and point at the menu board, trying not to thwack the cheerleader with the Sharpie'd hearts on her nametag at the register with an outstretched palm. 

Whatever \"Southwestern Hubbaheyandtheho\" sandwich she says I pointed at is what I'll get. Same goes for soup. \"Give me the soupy one, please\" I say. \"The one with the things in it.' 

If that ordeal wasn't enough, she ups the difficulty on that by being all \"do you want some moooorrre bread with that or an apple?\". I have so much bread coming already. I'm already getting bread with meat on top of it with more bread on top of it. But. Ugh. How do you choose? Double ugh. I give up."}
{"text":"Sugar!! The lemonade tastes like it was made from a Kool-Aid packet. Definitely not fresh squeezed."}
{"text":"I've never had an issue with a Panera. Then I ordered delivery.  For the most part, it was fine. However, in my You Pick Two, this was supposed to be one of their Chicken Avocado sandwiches. I opened the bread and inside was this. I understand this isn't a fancy restaurant but this is barely a sandwich. It's not worth $6 I paid for it. I also ordered a 4-cookie dessert - which again was fine. But the delivery driver told me they contacted me to tell me a certain cookie was out of stock. And they didn't. Just lying to me like that left a bad taste in my mouth. I've yet to hear from customer service so I'm leaving the review instead - for whatever that matters. But I expect a refund or some means of communication because it's unacceptable. This isn't Burger King"}
{"text":"I came to Panera bread for the first time, I was so excited to have one of their sandwiches because I had heard alot of good things. However when I got my bacon turkey bravo it was not fresh. The bread was soggy, the meat tasted like cardboard the tomatoes were just a gooey nasty mess as well as the lettuce being not fresh I would like to recommend not coming to this location ever 12 dollars for a soggy non appetizing stinky sandwich I will never return to Panera bread 

Furthermore the staff was very unreceptive the manager tried to tell me the sandwich was fresh and obviously had been sitting and soaking in the sandwich juices since morning NOT FRESH!! please Panera bread stop lying to and overcharging customers

P.S. learn how to count! When the return was made the MANAGER gave me incorrect change because she was upset about the sandwich return"}
{"text":"This particular Panera had a very friendly staff.  Especially a couple of the women who are always smiling and ready to take your order!  However I am disappointed that that the dining area is always messy!  The floor is somewhat disgusting and there is rarely a clean table!  This is close to work and serves its purpose for a quickly needed lunch!"}
{"text":"I'm just going to say big Thank You to a manager Manny (sorry if I misspelled!) my husband and I had one issue there but he solves it perfectly back in autumn 2017 thanks again!"}
{"text":"Overpriced healthy hipster food.

I like how their menus contain the calorie content. It's good and it helps most customers I suppose.

All items in their menu are overpriced. I would only go to Panera Bread if I absolutely have no other place to go to.

There was a time when I would always order the French Baguette as a side, and the cashier would of course say they have them avaialble, but voila! when the food comes, the server would say \"oh we ran out of baguettes so I replaced it with white bread\". Well that wasn't the one I ordered now, was it? I hope that the cashiers could tell me right when I order that they are out of baguettes. They did this to me at least 3 times! Not so good service taking into consideration how much their customers pay for such a little amount of food.

The rewards program was also horrible in a sense that for a certain amount of visits I get rewarded like a dollar off something. There was an instance when I had to visit 7 times to get a reward. I was very curious of the reward after the 7th visit, so I kept coming to Panera, and when I came in to check what my next reward is, thinking it had to be at least a free sandwich or something (because it's 7 visits to unlock a reward), to my disappointment, it was 1 dollar off a pastry. WOW, that was the last straw, I'm not going back to this place."}
{"text":"A for effort. Timeliness, friendliness a plus. Tuna sandwich, i asked for was not on the menu at the drive thru. I now know why, it was pretty bad. Just don't order the tuna."}
{"text":"Always happy when I go there, and if a rare mistake is made in the order they have great customer service to replace the meal next time!"}
{"text":"This is the second time i went to this location, first time was okay didnt give me my drink and had to ask for it. They did this the second time. I went there for dinner both occasions and didnt feel very welcomed by the service. The guy made me my drink and left it on a ledge and ran off. I wish i couldve said thanks but i didnt feel very grateful towards anyone of them. thanks for forgetting to give me my drink!"}
{"text":"Sitting in here right now enjoying my meal (they got rid of one of my favorite items so i was sad), when i jear an unhappy customer saying a coupon was explained to her wrong. What looked like a manager and an employee both discussed the situation with the customer, deescalated the situation, then offered her a free pastry as an apology. I am very big on customer service and that speaks volumes to me. The employees were all smiles and the customer laughed about it and every one was happy. Customer service at its best and should be rewarded as such. Will definately return with coworkers often. BIG UPS TO KAT!"}
{"text":"I love all the outlets they have at this location. The food is always fast but finding parking is virtually impossible."}
{"text":"Seriously, people, five stars for Panera Bread?  Y'all don't get out enough.

So far as I can tell, Panera is a pseudo-trendy food stand aimed at the same suburban yuppies that shop for music from Starbucks and proudly drive Ford Escape Hybrids.  The pastries are decent at best but incredibly overpriced.  You can get donuts and cookies that are just as good for less than half the price at the Giant Eagle across the street.   And how about the food?  Decent soup, shitty little sandwiches, and again (as if it's a dominant theme), incredibly overpriced.

I guess that mark-up is for the \"hip\"-ness factor?

Panera always reminds me of eating lunch in elementary school, back when those Lunchable things were fashionable.  I begged and begged my mom to buy me those things for my lunch because they were cool, but once I actually ate it, I felt cheated and unfulfilled.  Glad I learned that lesson way back them... otherwise, I might actually be a Panera devotee today to get some coolness by osmosis.  Sure as hell wouldn't be for the food."}
{"text":"Best bread, soup and salads!!!  Very clean and fresh food. I've been Going to panera for years (I'm from St. Louis), and I love it.  Im so  happy that  AZ is getting more and more stores in AZ and California."}

We frequent this location a lot as there are no locations in the Durham area

We always go for the Bacon Turkey Bravo

Cannot go wrong with that sandwich

I also tried the Italian and it's not bad either

Love the large cookie you get

The cinnamon bun is quite yummy too

Can't go wrong here for a lunch or small dinner"}
{"text":"How does a restaurant with 'Bread' in the name run out of the very thing you go there for??? Also out of the salad I wanted! Poor management obviously - will not be going back."}
{"text":"Worst Panera ever!! Did the drive-through. Chicken apple cheddar sandwich was disgustingly soggy, sitting in a pool of liquid with both pieces of bread soaked through..and it had no cheddar on it. The side greek salad lettuce was wilted, there were no kalamata olives or peppers, and instead of red onions it had pickled onions!? Everything looked like it had been sitting around for longer than I'd like to know. Gross."}
{"text":"Good Food. but my goodness, portion sizes are so small. AND it's EXPENSIVE as hell. 

They have the BEST iced green tea! definitely give that a try!"}
{"text":"What a waste of money!! Ordered a turkey sandwich and all that came with in was meat, lettuce and bread for $7.34. Ripoff!!"}
{"text":"Accurate order.......Ha. I took out an order after getting home I found out the order was wrong. Will NEVER go back to that location  One chance to make a first impression"}
{"text":"at panera greentree watching the manager pretend to be busy while a long line of customers forms. is it necessary to clear dishes and count pastries while one cashier tries to help everyone? i stopped going to the galleria location for this reason. always people waiting and staff scrambling like mad while managers do NOTHING. this is how orders get rushed and go out wrong and customers stop coming back. remember that perception is reality so if it looks like your manager doesnt care about the customers then thats the reality."}
{"text":"Wow! I don't know who these paid review writers are but there is no way that this place is worth five stars. Perhaps I visited on a bad night? Maybe. But I doubt it. A well trained staff will execute/deliver all the time no matter what. That place was ridiculous. 

Here's the breakdown of my experience:

- overall appearance: 2.5 - 3
- customer service: 3.5 - 4
- food quality: 2
- food presentation: 1.5 (sloppy with dirty utensils)
- coffee: 1.5 (it almost tasted like coffee) 

Recommendations:
- retrain the staff 
- teach them how to mop a floor without leaving it wet for customers to fall. 
- stop serving customers shit that you wouldn't accept. 

Sad."}
{"text":"I used the rapid ordering using my mobile device. No account needed, I logged in as guest. It was a super easy and convenient. When I placed my order, I knew the Panera was across the street. By the time I got in my car and drove to Panera my food was perfectly packed in two bags awaiting my pick up. It was clearly labeled and ready to go. They mean it when they say your food will be ready in 8 minutes or less. So easy!!!  When I arrived home the food was well prepared and delicious. Thank you Panera, I highly recommend using the mobile ordering, so convenient."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Perfect place to come for a quick lunch as they prepare the food very effectively. High quality food with the taste to match! Enjoyed the chipotle avocado melt and chicken noodle soup came back today and had the Mac and cheese instead of the soup. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"The place is absolutely filthy from the bathrooms to the kitchen where they're cooking you got bacon on the floors just nasty"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh love this place! They have an amazing rewards program and the staff is always awesome, today a lady named April took good care of me thanks girl ! Be back soon:)"}
{"text":"I frequent this Panera and overall I have never had a poor experience here. The restaurant is always clean with the except of a couple of tables during the lunch rush. But I always see the employees wiping down table every 15 minutes to make sure it remains clean."}
{"text":"The salad had more corn chips than actual salad, i specifically asked for utensils and the women helping me assured me there was utensil well low and behold we have no utensils and no napkins. We grabbed this meal on the go, thanks Panera. Never again at this location."}
{"text":"Packed place during lunch time on a Saturday! A little hectic finding a table. 

Got the You Pick Two with Frontega Chicken Panini and Fuji Apple Chicken Salad. They got that I wanted dressing on the side and no onions,  but they forgot to omit the tomatoes in the panini. 

People on the line were friendly though I was disappointed with the table service. The girl placed our food on the table without repeating the order or telling us what it was. The cashier also did not repeat the order but she was friendly. 

As a former employee (at a different location), we were drilled to make the customers experience the best way possible by repeating orders and having orders come out both quickly and accurately. The customer service is just the difference that I noticed between other locations I've been to. Having said, I'm happy that the food is consistent (I picked the items with the least calories)."}
{"text":"Met some friends here for lunch the other day.  I had the soup, chicken with rice, 1/2 italian sandwich and a drink.  I thought they were both very good.  For only .99 I included a danish to bring home to my husband.  While there are many choices I thought that the soup and sandwich was a special however when I got home and reviewed the bill I realized that the $14 they charged (take away .99 for the danish) was a lot of money for what I had, and that does not even include a tip.  The soup was $4.09 and 1/2 a sandwich was $5.39.  I would visit here again but next time be more cognizant of the costs of the menu items"}
{"text":"Wonderful service, but never used buzzer before so that was weird. But worked out. I got a breadbowl and hubs got the Greek salad (he's Greek and loved it) will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful date with my husband, he got the chicken noodle bowl, and I got the chicken noodle bread bowl. We loved  our lunch."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came in after me having a major craving. I get my go to, chicken noodle in a bread bowl, my fiancé steak and white cheddar panini. Both were great.  But the location isn't the easiest to get to do this one isn't our immediate choice in store. But thank you for being amazing!"}
{"text":"We have been to many paneras in many states but this one is absolutely hands down the best!!  The manager Jason Pothier runs a tight ship. His people are great and he is constantly out and about doing everything that needs to be done. We could not have possibly had a better dining experience"}
{"text":"Oh Panera's....I always feel virtuous and healthy when I eat here, but in reality the breads are probably just as bad for me as a buger.  Oh well, the food is terrific and I always find a new soup to try.  Chocolate croissants and baguettes in the bakery are fantastic.  I hit this place up for lunch a couple times a month.  Yum. 5 stars."}
{"text":"My wife asked for a very simple sandwich...cheese with some veggies on sourdough.  Not only did they screw it up, they took forever to acknowledge her, and give her her money back...avoid if possible...there is too many other choices in the area."}
{"text":"Panera is a minute's walk away from my work so I go there on the days I don't bring my own food. Being that it's part of a chain and I like some of their items, I can't really complain about the quality of the food. I'm knocking off a couple of points for some serious issues, though, that don't necessarily affect everyone:

1. I'm allergic to avocado, and more than once when I specifically ordered the Chicken Cobb Salad WITHOUT adding avocado, I was given avocado. The one time that I mentioned it to one of the employees, they took it back and then brought me back the same salad, without the avocado on top. Now, I'm lucky--I just get really itchy and my throat swells a little. But if you have a severe allergy that can lead to anaphylactic shock, this is unacceptable. The way a lot of the staff handle food allergies isn't nearly as serious as it ought to be, especially considering I've never even ordered the \"with avocado\" option. I will say that the cashiers have always been amazing about noting allergies in my order in huge letters, though!

2. I work at the international school near Panera and we have students who regularly go there for lunch. Some of our students are Muslim and eat according to halal standards. A student of mine has ordered sandwiches and specifically requested no bacon, knowing that it's pork and he can't eat it, on items that come with bacon. He's been given the sandwich with bacon on it despite that.

Food allergies and food limitations are a BIG DEAL. It's not like someone's ordering something especially complicated in either of the above situations--we're just asking for an omission of one ingredient in each situation. This Panera location is pretty busy and that's why I try to be patient (and just stopped ordering items that can come with avocado altogether to be safe) but the blasé attitude toward special dietary restrictions makes me worry.

I do want to emphasize that this location does have great service in general. The cashiers are all sweet and happy to help you out, and the cooks get food out quickly even when they're swamped. The quality of the food is what I expect from the chain, too. And the bread, god, always amazing. Dietary needs just really, really need to be considered more carefully by the staff.

In the meantime, if you have any dietary restrictions, always make them VERY clear to the cashiers when placing your order. If you use the rapid pickup option from your phone or online, make the note in all caps - when I'm super obnoxious and put all caps and a ton of exclamation points, no one puts avocado on my salad!"}
{"text":"No matter which Panera location you visit, the service and the selections are consistently very good and satisfying. The lunch variety allows you to \"Pick 2\" with a soup/sandwich combo, or a selection of other items. Some great choices to pick from, order processing is efficient and prices are reasonable. Rapid Pick up is very convenient, and is ready to pick up when you specify the time online. 

The stores are clean, and the service is friendly and helpful. If you have a My Panera card, you are rewarded with free items on frequent visits. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a good while - today is not their best day.  Mid-morning:  two coffee pots empty, out of one flavor of bagels, and the staff does not seem greatly concerned.  They need a wake-up call soon."}
{"text":"Oh Panera, you've made your way to Canada.. Welcome! Ok I'll be honest, I've never heard of this place before about a week ago when my sissy mentioned it to me in passing.  Well if you know me, you'll know my name is synonymous with bread, so at the earliest time, I went.  

This place is packed to the max, the lines were the longest I've ever seen for a bread bakery place. Crazy! it's ironically in the same location as where Krispy Kremes used to be... I hope Panera isn't just a fade that faded faster than Krispy Kreme could bring out a fresh batch of glazed donuts.  

They have so many different types of artisan bread, it was carb heaven! They also make sandwiches, which were a little pricey. Everything was pretty pricey, but the quality is pretty worth it. I got the Asiago Demi loaf, as well as a chocolate chip muffin cap.  The demi loaf (a smaller loaf) was $3.29 which I guess isn't too bad. Bagels were priced at $1.39 each or a dozen for $11.99! That's a little too much, especially since you can go to other bakeries and get a dozen for like $5.  

Anyway, I like this place. It's not a place I would go to regularly, but if/when I'm in the area, I'll for sure make a stop through..."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for a quick salad and sandwich. Have been to many other locations, this was my first time in this one. I like the 2 for 2 menu,I  like trying different sandwiches. I got the chicken panini and Greek salad. I got my order to go and it was ready in less than 5 minutes. The cashier was friendly and helpful. Little disappointed to see my favorite panini- chicken and artichoke is now discontinued. 
I went in around 4 pm and it was pretty empty, just a few people on their laptops or reading. I like the vibe, feels like a library/cafe. Got home and my order was perfect. Nice spot for a quick fresh and inexpensive meal. I was excited to use my $2 coupon , but realized it expired 2weeks ago."}
{"text":"Great for soup and sandwich combos, pastries, smoothies, coffee, salads,etc.
Great place for meeting up with a small group of friends or a if you are in need of a quiet place to study and grab a bite. Service with a smile. Though the dining room/drink station was a bit messy, it was rush hour however and an employee was quick to take care of it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They have great coffee and tea at great prices. I especially enjoy the friendly workers and it also has a nice new decor. I would suggest their tasty variety of baked good for it is truest a delight."}
{"text":"This Panera is never clean. The table are always dirty. The lines are always long. The food is overpriced and is poor quality food. $9 for a bowl of soup and a tiny piece of bread. The soup is just broth. Complete rip off. The only thing good at Panera is their chocolate chip cookies."}
{"text":"Disappointed once again. Picked up lunch for myself and a friend. Got the Won Ton Broth Bowl a large iced tea, a you pick two Chicken Noodle Soup and Fuji Apple Salad and another large iced tea. It was $25 and change. What a joke. The portions are miniscual! Smaller than dine in. Both soup containers were only half full and the Chicken Noodle Soup was mostly broth. I would say 3 ounces at most. It was my first time trying the Won Ton Broth Bowl which was also only half full. As I was eating the wontons I was thrown off by the flavor and consistancy. It tasted exactky like the Chef Boyardi brand Raviolis with an asian broth. It had the exact same gross filling as the canned 99 cent raviolis. Seriously low quality and a complete rip off!! I am done with the over priced and low quality food chain. And what's up with the apple, chips or bread? None of the above please."}
{"text":"I usually love this place but this time they didn't remind me that my sandwich didn't come warm and when the guy came to serve it I asked him if he could just toast the bread and he walked off service is something to be desired"}
{"text":"$9.30 for a half-filled bowl of pasta. Seriously! See the pic. Yes, I have taken ONE bite; but the bowl is, literally, half full. Rip off!"}
{"text":"I was actually looking for Zabas, which has apparently closed, when I came across this Panera location. My review is not so much for the food, which was perfectly fine--a simple turkey BLT and a strawberry fields salad, nor for the employees who were polite and attentive. Nope, my impression of the place was ruined by the filthiness of the bathrooms.  After I placed my order, I went to use the ladies' room. It was absolutely gross--not just messy and needing a quick clean. The kind of grime on the floors, in the corners, and around the base of the stall walls wasn't from a busy day or even week. I don't think those floors have been properly scrubbed and mopped ever!  The restaurant didn't seem short-staffed either. I counted at least 6 employees at the counters. Management really needs to take care of that."}
{"text":"I waited almost 20 minutes while i watched others receive their food for soup, salad, and kids buttered noodles. When they finally brought out our food I was met with half wilted lettuce with nothing but dressing. I inquired about the croutons and was told they were out but never was I given the option to change my order  prior to this discovery. When I asked why it took so long I was simply told that the were busy. There were no attempts to make up for the slow service though the girl who brought the food out apologized, nothing else was done. I come here a lot and was shocked at this experience."}
{"text":"We used rapid pickup for our order. Everything was ready when we got there, accurate, and good! The cashiers were also friendly and showed us where to pickup our order. Happy to have a Panera on this side of town."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever @ South Rampart. Placed Rapid PickUp order #113219434@320p for a time ready by 340pm. 10min expired past the Time of 340p. Finally asked, \"I had a Rapid Pickup order for 340.\"  The response \"It's gonna be another 10 min; we just got slammed.\" I was furious! Are you kidding me?!  What's the purpose of ordering online for a rapid pickup? I asked for a refund. Waited in line as the GM issued me a refund with no apology asking for my CC which I didn't have because I was there to just to pick up my food. My wallet was in the car.  Whole staff didn't care at all!!!  Terrible customer service and terrible service. Period.  Lost a customer!"}
{"text":"What's wrong with this restaurant ? I ordered a chicken tortellini pasta with half a Caesar salad & a small drink ...total : $14.17 plus tax
The Chicken Tortellini Alfredo pasta costs $8.79; it comes in a small bowl, smaller than a salad bowl, with very little pasta..the chicken is almost non existent, I counted it in my bowl ...there was only 1 & a half piece of chicken. The pasta bowl is supposed to be served warm, but it came as room temperature aka cold . The salad is a little better with a bigger bowl. But the whole thing is so sorry looking that it is not appetizing at all. In fact I think this s is really pathetic to charge so much for food that is so wrong. I want my money back !!!"}
{"text":"Been to Panera a number of times and it is just so incredibly overpriced for the quality of food you get.  13 dollars for a pick two? They gave us metal forks and plastic knives, had no ice in the soda machine and the food took forever to come out."}

      I decided to bring my laptop and phone to browse around on while I Enjoyed my breakfast......I could not find an outlet to support my intent.  There one one I seen available for the whole entire \"sit-in area\", which was already being used by another early bird. 
     In this day and age with so much new technology, we find this particular location delinquent in accommodation for the modern folks.  Perhaps the owner of \"Panera Bread\" would consider an upgrade...
In the mean time, after this morning, I will be bringing my morning hunger to a breakfast  place that can accommodate my interest with the Internet as well."}
{"text":"This place has definitely declined since changing from Paradise Bakery.  In the past, I frequented Paradise regularly since I live in the neighborhood.  Since Panera has taken over, the quality of food has gone down and the staff isn't as friendly or efficient. The dressing for the apple fugi salad was so watered down it left the salad tasteless and both myself and my room mate didn't finish our salad.  My roommate said her corn chowder was tasteless as well.  Both of these items we ordered very often....Bummer...Never going back... not worth the money or the aggravation of seeing a great chain of restaurants ruined..."}
{"text":"I go often here and do have a good experience, is a little shocking to see they're low rating. Food is tasty and service is ok, my only concern will be the price and the service do not mach each other."}
{"text":"New location in the area.  Ordered online they provided a pick time, I arrived at the time exact walked in order was ready, labeled with name.  I was told by the cashier it's grab and go SUPER CONVENIENT!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome location and free parking! 

They also have a large isolated room that is excellent for studying.  I think this might be the same location as 3401 Blvd of the Allies."}
{"text":"Went there this weekend and ordered food for 6 people. $60 or so bill. When done paying, they make me aware that I can get $1 pastries for every drink I bought. Cool. I'll take 5. But wait, I had already paid so the cashier needs management approval to give me $1 pastries. Manager says \"Nope, sorry. You already paid. It must be entered all in one order.\" Wait, what?? I like Panera but the manager just lost a customer for life. Long live Einstein Bros Bagels."}
{"text":"It's been a couple of years now since the Panera Bread Corp of St. Louis got Dan Patterson to sell out completely. However, I can assure you he and his family were the only ones to have benefited.
Quality has gone so far down hill. You can just tell the ingredients are more processed and a manager confirmed many of their food preparations like dressings, toppings and sauces are made in a central kitchen in another state of highly processed quality with plenty of food additives.
That Spinach power salad: I've been belching up that garlic flavor in that poor excuse for croutons for 6 hours now.
You can tell this place is more about corporate up selling as well; you can't walk through the line without some poor under paid employee half heartfelt trying to push their over priced cookies and deserts on you.

What a travesty, I remember when this was a great local chain that prided itself on its quality. No longer, it's lost to an enterprise only interested in the bottom line where corporate strategy includes lowering the cost and, ergo, the quality of food production. Another loss for Phoenix in the fast casual domain. This place is off of our lunch schedule during the work week and should be off yours as well. Support something local and who maintains quality standards."}
{"text":"My work office has ordered here a few times and I've also come here more than a handful of times, and service is so-so. It isn't terrible by any means, but it isn't the best either. They definitely could use a little help with maintaining their tables clean and their whole dining area. Every time our office has ordered here, the order is never perfect but that could be due to too many items we placed. I love their broccoli cheddar soup along with their frontega chicken panini."}
{"text":"Went to lunch today with my husband at Superstition Mall. Everyone was very friendly and service was fast. I got 1/2 sandwich, turkey, avocado, bacon, tomato, and lettuce. The amount of turkey covered only half the bread and had no flavor. I had twice as much tomato as I had meat. My sandwich was dripping tomato sauce so it was hard to hold.
I also got a tulip sugar cookie and that was awesome.
I'd go there for the cookies, but not a sandwich."}
{"text":"Quick bite before putt putt with the family and the food/atmosphere is cool. Customer service was good, but the prices of some of the sandwhiches can be relatively high."}
{"text":"I don't know what's up w/the 3 stars but this Panera is legit.  I was super exciting when I saw the coming soon sign and now I may have a slight obsession with ordering rapid pickup since it's so close to my office.  Orders have always been correct - and even when I accidentally ordered the wrong soup, they replaced it with the correct one without a hassle.  I'm super sad to be moving offices because I will miss my (at least once) weekly half turkey avocado BLT and broccoli cheese soup.  Hopefully there's one near my new gig!"}
{"text":"This panera location is BUSY... Almost always very busy. The lot is small so if there's no parking you'll have to park in the mall parking lot or wait for someone to leave. One review said this location is dirty and I've never really noticed that. The bathrooms are clean. The workers are also nice.

I really like their pick 2. I've been trying different salads but none have stood out. The watermelon feta salad is probably the best one IMO. I've had the Chinese cashew with chicken, spicy Thai with chicken and bbq with chicken as well. 

When the baguette is hot, it's the BEST THING EVER. I like their French onion soup even though it's a bit salty. 

Download the panera app or sign up for their rewards. You get a free pastry for signing up and random discounts here and there. They were giving away a free bagel everyday in August. I'm not fond of their bagels. I've tried the cinnamon raisin, chocolate chip and jalapeño cheese. All of their bagels are super hard if left out for a day. I'm sure they are a lot better if they're eaten right away."}
{"text":"Fourth time ordering from here to go and twice they have messed up my order. The most recent time I ordered a half Fuji chicken salad and called in, I was told it was a half salad so it would be done pretty quickly. I called at 11:52 and was told, it would be ready by 12:10. I got there at 12:25 and didn't see it on the pick up shelf. They probably forgot about the order because I've never had to wait that long to pick up a half salad from any panera, even when I'm dining in. A shift supervisor had to go make it, but she made it wrong. Seems like every time I try to say NO tomatoes, they always leave something else out as well.

The salad was supposed to have an arugula, kale, romaine mix but I only got romaine. The salad is also supposed to have Gorgonzola cheese but the salad didn't have that either. At least it didn't have tomatoes? 

Disappointed in this panera, and probably won't be ordering from this particular location in the future, at least not during my lunch break and not for rapid pick up."}
{"text":"Let me warn you if you have a sweet tooth and your trying to be good don't go in it's a cookie heaven and they are good. Pretty good lunch place soups,sandwiches,salads and of course those cookies.i"}
{"text":"Should be 3 1/2 stars . It's a pretty good sandwich place pricey I will have to say. But nice and clean great pastries.."}
{"text":"Installed and used the Panera Bread App, used the Rapid pick up which stated to pick up at 9:08 PM, which we live three minutes away.  By the time we got there the doors were locked, which meant they close at nine pm, which the app did not make no indications of time.  Last resort we went through the Drive through.  The young Lady acted like the Manager very kind respectful and understood.  Which she proceeded to explain new store getting the kinks out.  No where did I see or hear from Mangement.  
NOTE TO MANGEMENT:
create a SWOT Analysis, and also a Risk Plan to show these minor details, but for the consumer it is major.  Plus Mangement should have been at the Drive through window.  Lessons learned Mangement ."}
{"text":"Sometimes I skip the line at Starbucks and pop into Panera for my coffee.  I think I've finally learned my lesson.  Everytime I go to Panera for coffee, I stand around forever waiting for them to brew it."}
{"text":"Since Panera is a franchise, I'm sure we all have the 411 on the food, prices and typical atmosphere.  So instead, here are some inside tips to this particular location.  While most people refer to the Panera at the mall - it's not IN the mall.  It is a free standing building a few parking lots away from the mall.  You definitely won't be making a dash from Banana Republic to a \"You Pick Two!\"  Nevertheless, it's a quick car ride away and you do not have to get back on any main roads.

Parking is of course free, but on weekends you may need to park a little further than you want.  There are other surrounding stores and restaurants nearby (i.e. Olive Garden) so sharing those parking spots is...caring?  No, it's annoying but it's rare that I have a problem.

The staff at the Northlake location have never disappointed me.  I always get my honorary extra pickle without a dirty look.  In fact, I usually see smiles.  

Lesson of the day: great location, friendly staff, clean restaurant but stay away from the peak weekend shopping times if you are needing a quick fix!"}
{"text":"My meal was great today!!! Thank you!! Friendly staff!!! My fav is the broccoli soup! Sometimes I go to a location and they are out but today I was able to get it! I have Panera at least once a week."}
{"text":"must be new.. service was terrible, didn't even know, I had to tell the girl the way the special was run!!!  then had to still ask for dressing for my salad!!!  hope thye get better because most Paneras are wonderful!"}
{"text":"I ordered two whole sandwiches here, spent around $20 and then took them to go. The Avacado was brown. Bread was soggy. Now, I feel my innards turning on themselves. I am not in a position to break wind but if I was alone I'd probably be leave a nice brown streak in my pants. Never again!"}
{"text":"Food came fast and everything else was great. I just wasn't too happy that the person that was going to take my order was helping an employee in front of me and they continuously laughed, joked around, and took about 10 minutes talking before she actually took her order while aware that a line has started behind them. Other than that the food was decent."}
{"text":"A little pricey the food is okay. The coffee has good selection. Thats about it... It feels like a quick pit stop place."}
{"text":"These days I've kind went to Panera everyday for breakfast or launch and I tried some of their sandwiches and salads and I love it all. Healthy, tasty and yummy."}
{"text":"Ok, I am unable to check if my Rapid Pick up order is correct every time, especially when I order more items. Every time something is missing, I am really disappointed. So today Basil Pesto dressing was missing and bread is not sliced, as it was suppose to be. Enough is enough. They really do not give attention to details at this location. I so much love Panera and this is the closest location, but these constant mistakes deter me from ordering more, as I know that I can't count that I will get what I have a taste for, moreover I know that for certain I won't get my order prepared right. If that day ever comes that my order will show to be correct when I get home with it Im going to jump up of joy. Panera you should pay these people more, because as of now they really don't care for your business."}
{"text":"This Panera is always busy during lunch and dinner hours, that reassures me their food would be always somewhat fresh because of the amount of food they through a day! 
They are more expensive than most other quick service places you go eat at, compare to jersey mikes, or Quiznos, subways, you will have to pay about almost $10 -$12 for an entree and a drink. 

Ever since they changed their to go salad box from a box to a bowl it does seem like the size have gotten much smaller, but their green Cobb salad and the goddess dress is the most amazing thing! Very creamy and it is perfect with that salad, i can almost just drink those dressing if it was a little lighter !  And i also replaced the chicken in the salad for turkey, with little bit extra cost, the roast turkey is absolutely tender! Must try

If you are in a hurry, always do an app order or online order for rapid pick up! They do a great job on having the salad there for whenever you are ready for pick up, and also if you use the app you can also accumulate rewards for a free sweet treat or sometimes even a free salad!  If not, you can always order there, their service is moderately quick, and the sitting environment is clean , they also have outdoor covered sitting for a nice vegas day!"}
{"text":"On my list of all-time faves, the food never disappoints! Awesome variety of salads, soups & sandwiches, breakfast items, breads, the best cookies to be had outside of my own kitchen...I could eat here every day. They come up with new items regularly, all of which I've enjoyed,  like flatbread sandwiches (try the BBQ chicken) and the Soba Noodle Bowl (so savory). The only thing I dislike is that the seasonal items I love are just that...seasonal. Can't stand the wait for their return, like turkey chili, so delicious, which will be retired soon, and lemon cookies, from heaven!"}
{"text":"I came for the broccoli & cheese soup! 

Although I did have a pick 2 combo at another location, I did recommend my boyfriend to try it this time around.  Myself... just that amazing soup is all.  

It is all in all a very nice little cafe and place for business people, families and couples alike.  Although it is a little pricey, I can see as to why with what is offered.   

Sandwiches look fresh and everything is clean and tidy. 

Staff are friendly as well and bring the order to your table when it is ready.  

Glad I found one so close to home.  Truly a blessing.  

Will try items from the bakery soon enough.."}
{"text":"The quality at this location has really declined in the last year. The addition of the kiosk has helped speed up the ordering process, but the actual food assembly, especially on the delivery orders, totally \"sucks\". Panera would be wise to send in a secret shopper. I'm certain this is below the quality standards set forth by the organization."}
{"text":"They do a good job, usually all the things in the bakery are fresh. They usually make everything right, sometimes I'll get a random apple or bag of chips that I don't remember ordering and sometimes they take a few extra minutes. Sometimes the tables might be dirty but hey, it's a panera and there are hundreds of them. They do have beverages well stocked and the teas are always good. The drink station is always kept clean and neat."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Cafeteria style type of place, meaning you order your food, they give you a buzzer, when you buzz you go pick up your tray and sit anywhere. I'm pretty sure this place has free wi-fi since I almost always see people working away on laptops during their lunch. 

The Asiago roast beef sandwich is by far my favourite thing on the menu (the cheese bread is insanely good!) and the soups are also really good. Whenever you order a sandwich you get your choice of an apple, a baguette, or chips (YUM!)

For a few months I worked around the corner from this place, so I'd hit it up every now and again for lunch. The food gets prepared super quick, which makes it even better!"}
{"text":"Got to read this scam on ...The Loaded Potato soup.. So today my daughter and I went out to get our Wednesday loaded potato soup and I decided to try this little test at home since I've caught other restaurants cheating us out of our money when it comes to how much food we are really getting for the dollar in ounces. 

I purchased 2 large loaded baked potato soups at 5.59 each that is before taxes. The soups come out to $6.17 per large soup that's taxes included. 

If you order the \"Quart\" , Which is the \"largest\" \"value\" more for your buck deal. 
it is $16.53 with tax. 

The difference is $4.19 

According to Panera the quart is 2 1/2 large. That's actually not quite the case. You're paying $4.19 more for not even half a cup of a measuring cup. 

Because they don't fill it to the top so really you're getting only 2 cups and you're paying $4.19 more if you buy into the \"Quart purchase\"

 if you guys don't believe me go to Panera check it out for yourselves. I used water at home just to prove a point of how much it will hold. 2 cups equals 1 quart. in the picture I'm showing my index finger that's how much room is left in the cup and that's how much you get because they don't fill it to the top anyways. So for $4.19 more you're buying AIR LOL.

The whole time we've all been getting scammed.

Corporate you guys need to redo the math because you've been BUSTED!!!! 

by the way I called the Penera location tonight in Goodyear and notified them of this  Little scam they got going on they mentioned they would bring it to the managements attention let's see if that's really true.


4/13/17 after further review you're actually getting less than half a cup there is an arrow inside the quart which shows where the cut off is and it's actually less then so you're actually really only getting about 3 tablespoons more for $4.19 SHAME... 

According to Peneras customer service website they claim to sell 8oz 12oz and 32oz= quart  soup's. I would say somebody needs to go back to school to take a little more math because you're paying more money for less food bottom line..."}
{"text":"This is the only location we have frequented, and it is probably the most inconsistent in their service/offerings.
Sometimes they get my order right, sometimes not, and sometimes absolutely wrong. It's really disappointing when you come here, pay lots of $$ (for soup and sandwiches of all things) and they can't even get your order right.
I love their soups, I think they do them really good. I find their customer service a hit or miss. They don't seem to double check if they don't understand something they just go on and punch the order in. When I request to have something modified, most likely will find that they didn't follow through with it-resulting in going back up and telling them. I like coming here but I'm quite prepared to say something about my order. It is quite costly considering it's a fast food kind of place. Soups are tasty, and their sandwiches are good too. Sadly, they might run out of BREAD. I don't know HOW considering their brand is bread. *sigh 
It's a hit or miss, but if you want soup and comfort food I'd come here."}
{"text":"The food is good but the staff is terrible. I placed an order online for a flatbread and it is supposed to be done within 10 minutes. I was sitting in the waiting area for about 15 minutes and the manager walked past me probably about 5 times without saying anything. Finally 25 minutes after I placed my order I asked one of the associates when it would be ready.. She walked back to interrupt two of the employees laughing and fucking around then returned to tell me that they didn't have flatbread.. Wow.. Nice customer service right?"}
{"text":"I am truly in love with most of the staff here at this location the management staff is always friendly, and it is nice to actually have a bit of the same west coast things to study here. I am know to sit here most days for long periods at a time.

Yes the Wi-Fi is slower during the busy times and they combat that by only letting you use it for 30 min during peak times. 

So that is when I actually have to work as Netflix and hulu don't really want to work when everyone is around. 

Love that they make bread in store, and donate to local charity at the end of each day!"}
{"text":"I'm really shocked this Panera is only at 2.5 at the time I'm writing this! Panera is my home away from home and where I try to get as many meals as possible when I'm traveling for work. I know the menu and trust the food, and my experience here was just as good as any other location in the many other states I've visited. Service was on par, too. 
Totally satisfied with this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great coffee too!!!

Again, the service is not great. Now, if you are a friend of the cashier or a regular the service seems to be better. Hmmmm"}
{"text":"I love Panera Bread, in several cities, we always stop on road trips for bagels. I have been to this location before, maybe once, seemed ok. But we stopped in there on our way out of town about a week ago and had a horrible experience. Mainly because of one obnoxious employee who kept making fun of us and I almost asked to speak with the manager. There was a young lady there who was very nice, I think she was training someone, but this other young man had no people skills whatsoever. I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Panera is Panera no matter where you go, so I am sure they all have the same tasting food and drinks.  I am a huge fan of the quiche and I came here for breakfast while on a business trip.  One made this an enjoyable experience was the young lady that took my order was the most pleasant person I dealt with all week.  She was helpful and friendly.  Things like this make Panera a great go to place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Always a dirty dinning area and dirty utensils.  Use plastic if they have it.  If they can't keep tables clean I can't imagine what the kitchen is like.  Not once but every time."}
{"text":"I love this place.The food is very good and the service is wonderful.  It can be a bit busy at times and I think their menu is a bit overpriced so I cant give it a 5 star, but it could get there.  There is a very nice young woman who works there names Alyssa.  She is always very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Ordered a broth bowl, I swear they gave me half what they advertised."}
{"text":"Very relaxing atmosphere. I often come here when i finish my classes at Tri-C. Service can be slow sometimes, especially when its around dinner time, but they make everything fresh so it isn't that big of a deal to wait."}
{"text":"i didn't experience problems when i came to this location on a sunday afternoon.  despite being pretty packed, they managed to crank out my order (frontega chicken) pretty quickly without blunders. just like any panera bread, it's just a tad expensive for what they offer, but it's good enough. nothing wrong with the location either (it's not shady)."}
{"text":"Very long wait (I get it, you're new). It seems like drive thru staff at window don't pay attention. They tried to send me on my way without giving me half my order. 
I ordered an iced mocha that came completely unstirred. What I ended up with was a mouthful of chocolate syrup, because the milk/espresso was all on top, with a pile of chocolate on the bottom. What drive thru DOESN'T STIR DRINKS? (Yeah, that's what we want to do, open a drink, in our car, and try to stir chocolate syrup into a cold beverage...)
The sandwich was good, though VERY small compared to places like wildflower bread Co., and paradise bakery. Also, the tuna to mayo/dressing ratio seems to be off. I feel like I got a sandwich that was mostly mayo. I don't think I'll return for that. 
All in all, 11 bucks (after tax) for a coffee drink and a sandwich. That price seems high, for what I received, after a verrrrrry loooonnnnggg wait. I think I would rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Oh I just love this place and they have great service here. The managers bus so nice an I'm very picky but they usually always get my orders right, even though I ask for a bunch of stuff on the side"}
{"text":"They are so slow here but maybe that's why they work at Panera bread. They take like 40 min on 10 min rapid go orders but thank gosh the managers are great!"}
{"text":"Oh this place has such great customer service and they always get my order right. Everything always runs so smoothly even when they are packed, it's greatly appreciated. Also the ppl aren't like McDonald workers that hate their job they seen like they are all happy an enjoy being there"}
{"text":"Day 1 of a cold and I needed some soup. I got the chicken noodle Togo/Takeaway and a small sandwich. I got home and It was warm and good. I recommend not putting the sandwich on the bottom of the bag as it was slightly smashed. Not a bad spot."}
{"text":"Not your average Panera. I paid over $8 for a chicken salad sandwich that had hardly enough chicken salad to taste. They did, however, give me double the tomatoes. Not worth $8."}
{"text":"Your average Panera but one thing this place has that you would not expect in an urban location is a free parking lot."}
{"text":"This is something that Irwin desperately needed.  In a town that had almost nothing but fast food restaurants and chain sit down restaurants, it was so exciting to see a place like this open.  I know Panera is also a chain, but it is a different type of chain that has fresh food made fast (not your traditional fast food)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Panera!  I like the pick 2 that they have on the menu. I usually get a salad with soup.  I would recommend trying out the steak and blue cheese salad.  I'm not a fan of blue cheese, so I ask them for feta cheese instead.  The cream of chicken and wild rice is really good too!  I have yet to try the broth bowls, but if you go on their website and watch about 2 videos that are 2 minutes in length then you get $5.00 off of the broth bowl!  Hopefully, it's still on the website!  Check it out! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent choices of soup and great tasting but expensive for the amount you get in a cup or bowl.  Nice selection of salads and sandwiches."}
{"text":"There has only been a few occasions where they have messed up our order slightly and they handled it very well. I think their food is very delicious and a much healthier alternative than other fast food places."}
{"text":"Finally a panera that is close to me. The staff was friendly and my order was ready pretty fast too. I will be coming here a lot!"}
{"text":"Terrible food. I ordered a half sandwich and soup to go and it was ready in about 60 seconds. I just figured they had some skilled sandwich makers back there but this turkey apple cheddar sandwich was made hours ago, if not earlier. The bread is soggy wet all the way through and I had to peel it off the wrapper. The contents look just as old and sloppy, I have posted pictures separately. Panera is usually delicious, Gastonia needs to get their stuff together."}
{"text":"The staff were very friendly and accommodating to my dietary restrictions. They went over and beyond to help me by providing suggestions, adding extra veggies at no extra cost, and making sure I was happy with my selection. The food was fresh and tasty. The facility was clean and organized. My food came out vey quickly."}
{"text":"Great breads and sandwiches.  I don't have too much to say about Panera.  I visit occasionally for a sandwich and they have not disappointed.  I have never gotten any soups or even stayed to eat so I can't comment on dine-in service.  The staff is willing to recommend sandwiches and offer opinions if you ask.  If you are looking for a well made sandwich on fresh delicious bread, I don't think you could go wrong here."}
{"text":"This location is amazing! I frequent here during lunch time and the staff is always friendly and very quick. Completely satisfied with my experiences here and will continue to return!"}
{"text":"I loved my salad.  I asked plenty of question at the register.  Green Goddess Cobb is delicious.  I enjoy the option for a Fuji apple instead of bread.   $10.26 and full .  

Salad has antibiotic fresh chicken breast, fresh greens and a generous portion of   quality ingredients including a perfect avocado."}
{"text":"Sad, the best thing we had there was the mac n cheese.  Probably the only thing I'd go back for.  Paradise Bakery food quality was much better so I'm disappointed about this change.  Panera sandwiches are smaller too so not worth the money to eat here.  Go to Wildflower instead."}
{"text":"Not my favourite branch... Too dim and can get too crowded...

Similar to all paneras, good bread, salty but tasty combos..."}
{"text":"Not a huge Panera fan. Feels a little overly elitist? I don't know. Fresh bread but the soup is frozen like most all restaurants. 

ANYWAY, came in here since my partner had a hang over post wedding. Breakfast sandwich was fast and looked decent. 

Unofficial. Football games. You're going to want some hangover food. Even late night studying. Lunch with friends. Etc. 

Place was clean. Chairs strewn about but I think that rests on the patrons more than staff. Unsure if Panera has someone reset tables and chairs or just wipe them down. 

Dish drop off location could have used a wipe down. Maybe the staff is as hungover as the patrons on a Sunday. Still a Panera is a perfect \"nicer\" meal on a college budget. Study. Eat. Quieter place that isn't a Starbucks or a library."}
{"text":"I like this place but the parking situation can be nuts. There is parking on the side which is helpful. Power breakfast sandwich is very good and healthy. It can be a tad on the pricey side. Over 6 bucks for a small sandwich and bottle water, but I guess you are paying for atmosphere a little. Popular spot for business meetings. Can't imagine how much business gets done here!"}
{"text":"Quality has gone done significantly. Ordered a egg, bacon cheese on ciabatta. Open the sandwich and it's all egg and the bread isn't even toasted properly and the egg was cold. Last time I ordered here my food was also a hot mess. Save yourself the hassle go to the McCalisters in the shopping center across the street."}
{"text":"Ahhhh Panera! Love it! Wish there was a closer one! Miss my quick drives to the Panera for a nice lil quaint lunch or breakfast on the go. 

Bagels are always awesome, and freshly made. 

Pastries always melt in my mouth. 

Soups are always hearty and healthy.

Ambiance (for those not acquainted with Panera, think Starbucks, but BIGGER, and more variety!) So yes, college student, bring your laptop and study here! I have seen everything from corporate interviews (not for Panera by the way), to high school projects, college study groups, social gatherings, even people working from Panera vs. an office cubicle.

Staff are always friendly, and quick to serve up the food. Mistakes do happen every once in a while with orders, but not enough to be alarming. Place is always clean."}
{"text":"The music is very very loud. Don't come here for meetings or socializing. Impossible."}
{"text":"I went to Panera Bread for the first time and got a Kale/Romaine chicken Caesar and a fruit smoothie.  The salad came with a very large piece of bread and a cookie.  It was a decent salad and I liked the little parmesan crisps on the top. The sugar cookie from Paradise Bakery was yummy.  I would go back as you get a lot of food for a reasonable price, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"This is the worst panera establishment I have ever been to. They mess up your order 40% of the time and the customer service is horrendous. Drive to Sweet Melissa's or The Fix for soup and sandwiches. The worst part is the servers get very defensive when asking questions about items they end up messing up."}
{"text":"I love that I can walk to this Panera! Consistently delicious food and and a very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Had a great Greek salad. Very fresh, and good ingredients. 

I was surprised to find that they deliver your food directly to the table for you. No more waiting in line at the window to get your food. Kinda handy. 

Per usual, coffee was fresh and a little above average for a ship that doesn't specialize in coffee... But then I'm a bit of a coffee snob :-)"}
{"text":"The worst Panera I've ever encountered. I'm upset Yelp makes you put at least one star. After waiting an hour for my delivery, which was estimated 30 minutes, my order is the wrong one. The only solution I get is having my correct order delivered in an hour and a half. When I asked for a refund, the girl laughed at me. In what world should I pay for food it takes two and a half hours to receive and horrible guest service? Dana at Mayfield, you should be embarrassed by the way you handled this situation."}
{"text":"Like most chains on Green, it's okay for a meal, but it's not exceptional in any way. This place is often times packed for lunch, but I can't imagine it's because the food is so great, or the price is good. I grabbed dinner here once, and was let down. The food tastes no different from something you can make easily and cheaply at home with a microwave. I had the chicken tortellini alfredo and the mac & cheese (they have some sort of half and half option where you can pick two things). I also got a dinner roll. First thing you might notice is that the portions are SMALL. It was no where near enough food to satisfy an average adult IMO, and the price suggested larger portions. As I alluded to earlier, you could walk to County Market (5 mins), buy some premade pasta and sauce and kraft mac & cheese for about the same price, and get the same flavor, but easily twice the food or more. To top it all off, my so called dinner \"roll\", was nothing more than a slice of bread that they just threw in the bag (seriously, not wrapped or anything). I wouldn't give them any more of my money."}
{"text":"I go to a lot of Panera Breads but this one is my favorite is in Fairlawn they're very polite and friendly and the food is always good and they always are willing to have to have small talk with you"}
{"text":"Love the you pick two deal. I using get salad and sandwich or salad and soup. The French onion and broccoli cheddar soups are good. Love the Greek salad and the baked goods are delicious. I have always had great service the price is moderate to high"}
{"text":"the one star is for the seating..the rest is a no star. the coffee was out or cold. Staff were either not well trained and barely customer focused or they just don't like people. the food quality is mediocre at best,  cheap ingredients. food tastes lake warehouse made and site delivered abs maybe hated. online impersonal ordering may work in your east coast markets but in the west,  we like to talk to real people. we've tried on multiple occasions but doesn't match the marketing ads. AT ALL."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. We had delivery and it was very overpriced. I got a salad that was supposed to have pecans in it. No pecans. Two sides left off of order. Soup with hardly anything but broth. To top it off, three baguettes were tossed in the bottom of the bag. Almost $50 for 3 people and the portions were not large. I can't believe this place is still in business. I miss Paradise Bakery."}
{"text":"2.5 stars actually.
I come here a few times a month only because my mom likes to come here after I take her for a speed walk in the mall. The bagels are just ok. The prices are alright. The booths are comfy and coffee fresh most of the time. I like that there is a dark roast that truly is bold in flavor- consistently. The staff is never the same every time we visit, which means a high turnover rate. There are always lots of employees, but the only person busting their patooty is the person at the register that:

#1 - takes your order and is your cashier.
#2 - (thank goodness) puts on gloves and prepares your bagel for toasting ( by the way, for the years I have been coming here the toaster never works right.. it either under toasts the bagel or burns it to a crisp.. there is no in between) and then plates any baked goods and said bagel.
#3 - makes your espresso drink or smoothie.

The egg sandwiches are ok, about the same as McDonalds.

The oatmeal has only tasted fresh on one occasion. The topping includes pecans, so if you or a loved one has a nut allergy: BEWARE.
The oatmeal without the huge serving of brown sugar dumped on top is probably the healthiest thing on the menu for breakfast. 

Enjoy."}
{"text":"The food is what you'd expect,  decent,  however it's almost impossible to get a correct order from here. The drive thru takes forever,  for reasons I can't figure out.  They've given the wrong dressing for the wrong salad, wrong ingredients in the salad (adding almonds and chicken when they weren't supposed to be there when a vegetarian ordered the salad),  forgetting the chicken when I order it on something that should have it and etc.  It would just be nice to go there and actually get what we order."}
{"text":"This will be my last visit to this or any other panera store. I was just charged $5 for a 12oz smoothie (in a 16oz cup) and when I asked about it, was basically ignored. No manager was present for me to ask for a refund so I left. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Tonight is my last time trying this location. Over the last year they have gotten most of the orders wrong but tonight they really messed. I ordered potato soup but what i was given was clam chowder which i am allergic to. Thank goodness instead of taking a big bite i only stuck my tongue to check if it was hot. My mouth and tongue are swollen now but if i had actually had a bite i would be in the emergency room right now. Thanks panera for messing up yet again but almost killing me this time. I am done"}
{"text":"saw a fly dancing on my sandwich when waiting for my order, they don't bother to pay attention anyway since there are quite a lot customers , awful awful place even though i have very good experience with other panera bread"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times before and normally the food has been on point and the service has been decent. But after today's trip to Panera, it pains me to leave this 1 star review, but after what occurred today I felt that it was the only thing that I could do.

First, they were out of Broccoli Soup at 12:45 in the afternoon. I would have understood had it been later in the day sure, but you are in the middle of the lunch rush and you run out of a key item. Second was I ordered a Tomato and Mozzarella Panini and it was the most pathetic thing I have ever seen. The sandwich had 2 pieces of mozzarella cheese, 4 slices of tomato and and a pathetic amount of sun dried tomatoes. Third, the Turkey & Bacon Sandwich had no flavor what so ever. The sandwich looked like they just threw it together and there was no care to what it looked like. 

The only positive of this trip was the Peanut Butter Cookie, which is sad to say.

It really pains me to say this but I don't think I will be going back to this location and may not go back to Panera because this trip has really left a sour taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I was honestly a little disappointed in this location. I have been to Panera many times in the past when residing in Oregon and this location just did not live up to the standard. I understand that they are new and are working out some of the kinks, however, there is still a long way to go. 
The line was long, but don't let that stop you- they actually got to me VERY quickly. I asked the cashier for a recommendation between 2 options and she said she never tried either. Ok... no worries... I went with the Turkey Avocado BLT, tomato soup, and an iced chai. The soup was barely warm, the sandwich was gross (the meat appeared to be cooked but the texture once I bit in did not seem cooked) I took ONE bite. The chai tea is very delicious! However, I didn't pay ~$18 for good chai and lukewarm soup. I didn't bother discussing this with the manager because she was busy dealing with other issues from other customers."}
{"text":"Love this location. Ever since transition from paradise to Panera, I've been a big fan of stopping in when I'm out and about. No matter how busy it is, you always seem to be able to find a table and your food comes out super quick. When you order pick up, the food is waiting for you when you get there. No waiting in line. No unclear ordering procedure. Smooth and simple. Just the way it should be. They also have the best oatmeal raisin cookies in all of the valley and if you are as into them as I am, don't forget to ask about the \"buy 6, get 6 free\" :). Such friendly staff as well. They have their own delivery service now too. Yes they have a delivery fee but their fast and it beats having to pay the extra fee for third party drivers. (Postmates, door dash, Uber Eats). Thoroughly impressed. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this Panera location pretty much since it opened. It helps a lot that it is close to home. It is definitely a convenient place to go for a quick lunch or dinner. I like the homey feel of the cafe/restaurant, with plenty of booths and tables. 

Some of my go-to menu items include the Napa almond chicken salad sandwich (a refreshing crunchy chicken salad on soft white bread that has almond slivers and grape pieces in it - trust me, it works!), the Fuji apple chicken salad (with crispy apple chips, blue cheese, and a sweet vinaigrette - delicious!), and the barbecue chicken salad (vaguely reminiscent of the Cheesecake Factory barbecue chicken salad).

The staff are pretty friendly, especially the smiley Filipino evening manager, Jun. My hubby and I have lucked out sometimes when they have given out free pastries while we were dining in. 

One important tip: if you plan to eat at Panera more than once in your lifetime, make sure you sign up for their Panera card, a free membership that comes with tremendous benefits including a free pastry of your choice for signing up, an annual free pastry for your birthday (that unlike many other places does not need to be redeemed only on your birthday), and various other offers the more times you visit and make purchases at Panera locations. It seems over the last six months, I have received 3 emails from Panera informing me that I was entitled to a free daily coffee (any size) for the months of August, November, and January. For these reasons as well as the consistent service, clean comfortable dining atmosphere, and healthy food choices, I am happy to continue to keep going back to this location.

{"text":"I love Panera and the location always serves constantly great food. I have never had an issue with the food the only issue is space. Granted, it is the only location downtown so it gets crowded quickly during lunch hour rush but that's my only complaint."}
{"text":"Decent food. Overpriced. Ironically the bread is nothing to rave about. It tastes like it was frozen and warmed up which it probably was. All of this is ok though. I seldom go in there. In my part of town Panera has located in THE worst parking environments in town."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches and soups, a good deal with the soup and 1/2 sandwich and premium sandwiches only a dollar more!"}
{"text":"Fast service is what you'll get at this Panera. A nice family atmosphere, it's also a good place to meet friends and enjoy lunch or a sweet treat from the bakery. And don't forget to take some of your favorite bagels home. My favorite is the Cinnamon Crunch with the hazelnut cream cheese."}
{"text":"So it's been YEARS since I have been to a Paradise Bakery! Working at the mall will do that to you. Stopped in Sunday for some shopping fuel with my mom & sis. I had the sour dough bread bowl w the fire roasted tomato soup they also had posole which I thought was interesting. Mom and sis had sandwiches chicken walnut and the albacore. 

I had never been to a stand alone PBC before it was a little chaotic maybe because it was Mothers Day and the line was out the door?! They had their bottled water ads out and proceeds go to Free Arts of AZ http://www.freeartsaz.org/ just so happens to be my FAV charity they only had a small basket full and they were warm not on ice, the cashier suggested the cold Dasani water instead eh we drank it warm anyway then went down to Paciugo to cool off.

All in all I am glad we are getting some healthier chains up here as opposed to the Olive Garden, Applbee's, TGIF, Logans accross the street I will be back!"}
{"text":"I was so pleased this morning to pick up my catering order! The staff was so kind and the order was absolutely perfect. I so appreciated having all of the extra silverware, plates, napkins when traffic prevented me from arriving nearly enough to set up. Turns out it didn't matter because Panera made sure I had everything I needed :) The whole thing was met with appreciation by my coworkers. I will definitely be ordering again the next time we have a reason to celebrate at work! Thank you so much Panera."}
{"text":"First time at this location...inside is nice but smaller than expected. The food was good and consistent with other locations I've been to, but my soup was room temperature and I had to microwave it   The service staff never smiled except for the pleasant girl that brought my food to the table. The drink station is in the back and a little difficult to find. The fireplace in the wall is a cool feature!"}
{"text":"I ate at Panera today for lunch. I had a Greek salad and French onion soup. Within an hour, I started suffering from stomach pain, nausea, and diarrhea. It is obvious to me that it was food poisoning and I will not return to that location."}
{"text":"My favorite office on the go spot.   Staff is friendly and extremely helpful,  especially Shirley and Brandon.  Jim,  the manager goes out of his way to make your Panara experience the best imaginable...."}
{"text":"I am such a fan of Panera that it pains me to scribe this review, bit I must. As a self proclaimed regular of this location and several others within the Charlotte metro, I have noticed a disturbing trend at this location. While I can imagine that this is quite the profitable location, with bragging rights of over $3,000hr of service, I must report that the cleanliness level of this location has dwindled significantly. One has only to look along the walls, windows, floors, bathrooms to understand what I speak of. I'd like to see this location receive a  top to bottom scrubbing and a reinstalling of what I'm sure Panera corporate standards of cleanliness for their sites enforced. For it does little good for the company to invoke a healthy food campaign and the store fail to maintain excellent inviting levels of cleanliness."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the workers there are rude, lazy, and sit there on their phone at the register. C'mon, do your job!"}
{"text":"One of the better Panera's in Illinois

They have Apple Pay! Don't find that in many places even though Apple made it seem like it was the future.

The girl behind the counter was friendly and efficient.

The food came out fast and the soup was hot and delicious.

I have been here 3 times and it's always a pleasant experience. No surprises just a solid Panera"}
{"text":"I love the menu at Panera! No GMO's and all of the choices if you don't eat meat. What I'm confused about is the lack of security. My friend visited your location and ended up having credit cards taken from her wallet and her wallet put back in her purse.  Then the thieves went to Target and bought over $8,000 of items there on 3 cards. It is even more disturbing to find out that this is a common occurrence across the country between Panera and Target. Google it and read the articles. BE AWARE of your cards while visiting. These are professional thieves. Why isn't Panera putting better surveillance in their restaurants?"}
{"text":"Love Panera, but this morning I had what looked like a pretty grumpy cashier (Brianna) take my order. She didn't seem happy to be working there and made me feel like I had to make my order quickly and if I changed something, she's get bothered. I understand that everyone has their days, but leave your bad emotions at home and know that you are the first person I will be talking to for my order. Smile...it's not so bad. 

Everything else was ok. Waited a little longer than expected for my oder. It was an order To Go and they prepared it to dine in which added to the wait time."}
{"text":"Really, Nothing Special 

Panera Bread is a healthy option for lunch. Today, my lunch companion and I ordered sandwiches, chicken salad, and 2 different turkey sandwiches with chips. 

The chicken salad was on dark bread, with lettuce, tomatoes, and walnuts.  The walnuts really made the sandwich, however,  the chicken was a tad on the dry side as was the turkey.  All alone just a pretty average sandwich.

The food was fresh.  But in all was just an expensive sandwich."}
{"text":"Got breakfast from this location yesterday while out & about. I ordered the Greek Yogurt with Mixed Berries & a large Papaya & Passionfruit Green Tea. The drive thru service was very quick & efficient & my order? It was so good! I will definitely come back for those items again as well as other items & meal times. Having this restaurant close to where I live is awesome & knowing it's open & I can swing by & get it on my way to work is very much a definite plus! I WILL return!"}
{"text":"Definitely drive to settlers ridge instead of this one. 1pm in afternoon. Had to wait 15 minutes for my salad. Avocado brown and hard but yet they put it in the salad. Each time I try to come back to this one, I'm still disappointed. Had southwest lime chicken salad"}
{"text":"I was excited when Panera opened in old town. And I was pleasantly surprised to find that this location has the rapid pickup system where I'm able to order via a kiosk and bypass the lanes. The food is great and it's affordable."}
{"text":"Fabulous service!  Dining with my daughter who has food allergies and the staff was extremely accommodating."}
{"text":"I called earlier asking if they had the cinnamon crusted bagels, they were out and told me to come in around 6:00pm. Walked in and someone had just bought all they had made. Was I Upset, Nope! The manager immediately stepped up and offered me 1/2 dozen of breads or sweets to make up for my inconvenience. Sweet, courteous and very customer oriented. Thank you for a wonderful experience"}
{"text":"The service was fast and good! Also Good employee there to help you with the manu if your not sure what to order! Well enjoyed :0)"}
{"text":"Every time I have been there I have always gotten dirty silverware with food dried on it. So today I tried to order it to go and when I got home my sandwich that I ordered was completely messed up. My salad also came with only a couple of drops of dressing."}
{"text":"Always packed to the rafters! Great service and staff is awesome. Food always fresh and delicious. Only reason I did not give a full 5 stars is the location. Definitely keep it in the neighborhood but needs more space and tables. District location has a nice patio and if this Panera could find similar ..all of my cash would be well spent! Love you guys!"}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff!
I was more a fan of the soup than the sandwich, I got the \"you-pick-two\" and got the french onion soup and the steak and cheese panini. Steak and cheese was ehh-ok, lacking in thickness and really lacking in a steak-y flavor,  but the soup was delicious and the all the bread involved in my meal was awesome. Probably why they are a \"Bread Cafe.\" The soup was one of the better french onions I have ever experienced, the croutons in the soup were soaking in the broth and the soup wasn't too salty, but had a great onion-y flavor and was a pretty good size. 

The service was really good and fast, and the place was clean, and the food was pretty solid. It's in a nice location, close to the intersection of St. Rose and Eastern, where they pretty much have everything you can imagine within a 3 mile radius. 

I've been a fan of Panera bread since the first time I ever went years ago, and this was a solid experience and not pricey at all. The sandwich lacked a little, but with the total amount of food it was great for the price.

4 solid stars. I'll be back"}
{"text":"We used the Panera app to purchase a rapid pick-up order. It was really user friendly and simple enough to navigate and pay. However, when we picked up the order, our items were smashed in the bag, the baguettes looked like they had been tossed in as an afterthought. They were just rolling around in there. A sandwich that had avocado wasn't wrapped well so the sandwich was falling apart and the avocado was turning brown pretty quickly. The pastries were in a box, but one of the cookies was in its own bag and it was thrown on top of a brownie. The bag the cookie was in was covered with icing from the brownie.  Ugh. The order was correct at least, but it was a mess and food was everywhere. I really like the app, I just hope they work out the execution."}
{"text":"I used to go to a Panera in Lacey, WA quite a bit. I don't know if it's just me but the food here is nothing compared to that location. My egg white avocado, spinach sandwich was soggy like actually dripping water while I was trying to eat it. The bread had  turned to mush. I might try it agin but not this location."}
{"text":"17 minutes for my food.... I see all the staff standing around, and one employee is on their phone.  I get it's NOT busy around 4:33pm, but my Luke warm soup and cold bread had to take the fall for it. This Panera always takes to long. I've spent so much money and chance after chance I finally wrote a review. Save your money and go somewhere else. They also forgot my cookie and gave me a cold hard one... the girl who gave it to the employee running the food was extra rude."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous. I ordered a soup and salad for lunch to be delivered to my job today and could only eat the soup. My salad was rotten. I got the green goddess salad and the lettuce was brown. Some pieces were mushy. My avocado was brown and rotten. I'm afraid I will get food poisoning from the few bites I had before discovering the bad lettuce. Whoever made this salad should be ashamed. I have paid for a salad I could not eat and remain hungry. Thanks a lot Panera."}
{"text":"Great new offering at The Shops at Don Mills. Lots of fresh delicacies. Well priced. Great service. The staff seems genuinely glad to be here."}
{"text":"One star because on a Friday morning only one cashier working. Waited 5 mins while the cashier and customer chatted about New Years plans . Plenty of staff walking around but no one acknowledged the line of 3 people waiting. Very disappointed won't be rushing back to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Panera's rewards program and their baker's dozen bagel special on Tuesdays. I feel like I'm getting a special reward every other week. I would recommend splitting their family-sized soup for 2 or 3 people."}
{"text":"Typical food you would expect here. I enjoy it even though it's expensive. But it would have been nice if when I got up to refill my drink, I didn't come back to see the bus see clear my table with half my soup and my whole cookie still on the tray (all I had finished was my sandwich) but all my stuff was still at the table. It was clear that I wasn't finished is my point. But the teenager said sorry and gave me back my soup from the tray which had other tables trash on it at this point. The tray not the soup. But this experience just reminded my why I spend my money other places. Shoot, even subway with that kind of crap."}
{"text":"I'm seriously disappointed that all of the Paradise Bakeries were replaced with Paneras. It's just not the same. They do not have all the same menu items that Paradise did. For example, the fire roasted tomato soup is not carried by Panera, and neither is the Turkey Cranberry Sandwich. The fire roasted tomato soup was amazing! The current tomato soup offered by Panera does not compare. And Paradise used to give you a cookie with your food. Panera does not. When I ordered a half sandwich and soup, they gave me a bread. I mean really? If I'm eating a sandwich, why on earth would I want more bread? Just give me the damn cookie, shoot. Speaking of cookies, they also used to offer BOGO deals with their cookies and now they don't, because they're cheapskates. I paid $11 a few days ago for a small French onion soup (by the way, where's the CHEESE?), a half of a turkey walnut salad with the saddest little scoop of turkey walnut salad on it, a drink and a cookie. I guess it wouldn't be so disappointing if their portion sizes weren't so small, but they are. And the food is just not as good or as satisfying as Paradise."}
{"text":"Avoid this store! Very questionable, unprofessional, abusive employees. There is no manager and they refuse to give the number for customer care. They can,t take an order and the food is a problem- I.e. Yogurt with no date ,inedible sandwiches,stale pastries.Since the company went private this location is terrible-no accountability, no decent employees.STAY AWAY! The franchisee doesn't care about customer service."}
{"text":"Sometimes the line is long but they staff is fast. The cafe is very spacious and the Internet works fine. Parking is a little tricky here there are plenty of other busy businesses. I'm always tempted to grab coffee before  a massage. If I am studying and don't need coffee I bring my refillable water bottle and self serve. Plugs are scarce in the booths but available along the walls. I have only had a problem once with a patron trying to talk to me while I was busy studying. It can be very busy during soccer games but only experienced that once. I come here 2-3 times a month at random times and days. The seats are more comfortable than the coffeebean and tealeaf down the street."}
{"text":"I'm quite new to Panera, as there aren't any conventient to where I live or work, so apparently I don't know the proper \"procedure\" of how to order. The girl at the register as well as the man (or should I say boy) were quite rude and gave me dirty looks. Maybe if the staff wasn't comprised of all teenagers, my experience would have been better. They were ALL very rude and not helpful at all.

As for my food, I ordered the Asiago steak sandwich, which was very tasty. But very sloppily put together. The onions and tomatoes were falling off and the steak did not cover the bread. I had to rebuild the sandwich, but it was very tasty.

I will definitely try Panera again, but not this location."}
{"text":"I ordered a half sandwich abd a bowl of soup.  The sandwich was a beef sandwich.  We sat down and my lunch was brought to me, ok, the sandwich was barely a sandwich, the portion of meathad to have been for a child of 2 yrs, I went up to the sandwich counter and asked if this was correct in size, the girl behind the counter stated that it was, that as Panera, they are only allowed to use the pre portions.  As I ate my sandwich I noticed a odd taste, I thought that it tasted like horse radish, I went to the front counter to read the cluttered menu board to see if it was there, no, it wasn't I asked four the manager, a young lady asked if I had a problem, I shared that if they are going to put horse radish on a sandwich they should show that and not make it a surprise, I Hate Horse Radish.  The bun for my sandwich was so big that it weighed three time what the meat did.  

She says thanks and stuff she would look in to it.

The staff is so young that you aren't sure who is in charge.

I will not go back,  please bring back, paradise bakery."}
{"text":"Always have issues with an order. I ordered the pick 2- Chicken Caesar salad and broccoli cheese soup. I received Italian dressing instead of Caesar. I went up to get the correct dressing and the employee was very lazily standing around and had no sense of urgency to get me the correct dressing or apologize for the mistake. I did get the correct dressing finally but irritated with lack of attention to detail and laziness."}
{"text":"Not very happy!  Ordered pick 2 Salad(which was good) and Bistro onion soup! I was given chicken noodle and when I let the food counter know that it wasn't what I ordered, they walked away and wouldn't fix my order. My receipt showed bistro onion as well.  Irritated that they couldn't read the order properly and wouldn't fix it!"}
{"text":"Service isn't horrible but could use some improvement. Food isn't that great anymore. Stick to soup and you'll be happy. Anything else sucks. The line is sort of confusing when you walk in. Kept very clean."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Ordered two half sandwiches and a salad at 2:31pm. To go. It's now 2:48pm. We are two of 5 customers here (they had there food before we arrived) and I'm pretty sure they forgot our order. I just went up to the window to ask where our food was and the woman told me it would be brought to us personally by her. We waited for another 10 minutes. I went back up to ask what was happening and our bag was just sitting there. We finally left with our to go order just after 3:00pm. Very disappointed

Update:
Just got home and our order was completely wrong. We got a completely different sandwich than we ordered and it was missing our salad. I cannot believe this. I have no idea how this place is still functioning. If you're trying to get a quick lunch during your break GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. If you're trying to receive the food you ordered, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

UPDATE:
In my chicken walnut sandwich, there were three walnut shell pieces that hurt dearly when trying to eat my sandwich. Also, on the receipt, there is a section for \"order checked by,\" not really sure why this is there; just for show?"}
{"text":"Lots of food and beverage breakfast options. Super fast service. A short walk from UPMC MaGee-Women's Hospital."}
{"text":"This is the worst Panera I've ever been to. There were 2 other tables besides us there & crap was all over the floor, coffee urns were either empty or coffee was 4 hours old, staff was obviously apathetic, our soup was lukewarm & bread alongside it was straight up cold. Not \"unheated\" but cold like it came out of the fridge. The table next to ours sent theirs back. We didn't bother, we just vowed never to come back."}
{"text":"Best food ever!! Love love love their salads, sandwiches, cookies and soup! A bit pricey but good portions and fresh food."}
{"text":"Best place for soup and sandwich... Great service and food! Autumn squash soup really good and get it with any half sandwich, makes a great combo!"}
{"text":"I love this Panera! My husband and I come here once a week and everyone is always so nice and so friendly. I can't even count how many times we've been here and they have only ever gotten our order wrong once, and they gave us a pastry and fixed it really quickly and couldn't have been more accommodating. 

I just recently tried placing a mobile order and it is the most amazing thing ever. It was done so fast, five minutes before they said it would be, and the manager showed me where to pick up and offered me a drink while I waited. So easy and so convenient!

I feel like we get better service here than most of the more expensive places we frequent. I know it's a chain but they're really getting it right at this location."}
{"text":"I love panera for healthy(ish) fast food!

Been here since opening day on day 1 @ 6AM, still coming here today.
This panera is usually very crowded, especially during lunch rush and weekends but the staff are all great and work efficiently. The front-line staff are always pleasant and friendly, and always serving with a genuine smile. I like that. 
They are helpful and don't rush you as you are deciding what to order, and they always give recommendations if you don't know what you're going to get. 

I love the idea of paying and sitting first and then the food comes to you like a formal restaurant. The food comes very quickly and it's always made fresh for that day. 
I find the soups here to be amazing! I love the chicken noodle and black bean. If you like bread, you will absolutely adore the bread bowl. Soooo hearty and good! I can never finish the bread though, it's just too much carbs for one meal. 
The drinks are also pretty good! They always change and you should try them all!
I love the salads as well, the portions are pretty good & will fill you up!
It's not the cheapest option, but definitely more worth it than something like mcdonald's."}
{"text":"Walked to a very nice greeting, we knew someone that works here. The food was very good and fresh as advertised. The smoothies are amazing, but of course they're? made with a Vitamix, where I work. So, absolutely amazing experience."}
{"text":"This is a review of the bakery.  We did not dine here.  We had an event, and needed cookies.  Five-dozen.  They have a reasonable variety of cookies.  It is cheaper to make your own, of course, but these aren't too outrageous.  About $8 for a dozen, and they're reasonably large.

The cookies themselves are pretty good.  Frankly not as good as mine (I just follow the Tollhouse recipe, or whatever...I'm not a master baker by any means!).  But good.  Chocolate chip, sugar, snickerdoodles, and even a lemon cookie.  I also like their muffins."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place.  A sandwich shop that emphasizes \"clean\" food?  How great is that?!  Alas, not great enough.

First, let me say the employees are great.  Despite being really busy they were very friendly, very helpful, and very cheerful.  They seem to have a good team there.  Kudos for that.

We went with the \"pick 2\" option.  You can buy half or whole of most things, and then there's a \"pick 2\" in which you get two items.  The pricing per item is different than the half or whole, and I assume the quantity is also (but am not certain).  Anyway, that's what we did.  I had the \"Italian\" and a bowl of turkey chili.  When they arrived I was surprised how small they were.  I paid around $11 for a tiny sandwich and a tiny chili??  

Well, maybe the flavor will make up for it.  Except it didn't.  The sandwich was small in every regard.  Not a lot of filling (meat, lettuce, cheese, etc).  The bread seemed a bit crumbly.  Not exactly dry, but sort of.  The chili was a bit soupy but had decent flavor.  A bit more meat/beans would have been good.  

In short, don't believe their product photos.  The chili isn't that chunky, and the sandwiches aren't that big.

Overall, very underwhelming.  The combination of good people, \"clean food\", and a decent (if small) chili gets them two stars.  But I definitely wouldn't come back for another sandwich, especially not at these prices."}
{"text":"OMG finally a Panera by my work. I have been here twice and always such a great experience. They greeted me when I walked in and the staff members are so nice !!! Seriously beyond excited and really happy to have had great experiences so far. I'll most definitely be coming here twice a week"}
{"text":"Amazing fast service, healthy food, my fav are the salads. very clean place.....only thing is if you need internet it is extremely PAINFULLY slow..so make sure sure you use a personal hotspot from your cellphone. 

Other than that its a very nice place..although some of the staff are very nosy and will approach you and ask you what you do and what your occupation is..which is extremely unprofessional."}
{"text":"Their service is pretty good and friendly. The food at this location is fresher than other locations. The salads were not wilted and we're full of ingredients. The Mediterranean chicken flat bread was delicious!  The soups were good (autumn squash and roasted vegetables) and came out hot. The Avocado Cobb salad had huge chunks of avocado and blue cheese. 

They came and cleared our tables and checked in with us about the food and service. Good lunch spot but a little pricey still."}
{"text":"I usually stop here on my way to work and treat myself to an Asiago, Bacon, Cheese Breakfast Sandwich. These sandwiches are delicious! I stopped this morning and they were out of Asiago Bagels. RING THE ALARM! LOL. But the girl behind the counter was very accommodating about it. She explained on Fridays they're very busy. It's a running joke among staff that they named Fridays there Bagel Friday's. She did offer me the Asiago Bread instead but I choose the Whole grain bagel. Gotta have my bagel ya know. It was a great compliment to it.  I ordered a Café Mocha and she gave me a choice between skim or 2% milk. Never been asked that before."}
{"text":"I've always loved panera bread and I was so happy when one come to Phoenix :) the manager, josh I think was his name... is so friendly and welcoming!!! Absolutely love this location!!!"}
{"text":"This Panera knows what's happening. At 7am, they have this place fully stocked for professionals grabbing breakfast and lunch at the same time. Everyone is on point. Boom. It still takes a bit of a wait to get that sandwich made but these guys at least have a system and a STAFF ready for ya."}
{"text":"I have always been a Panera Bread fan. I office out of a number of their locations around the country.They have great wifi, but some locations have time limits during peak hours. However; all in all when I travel and need a familiar spot for lunch, Panera is usually where I go. I am very excited about the new clean menu. It gives me hope for all fast casual food establishments. I have allergies to a lot of additives so the new menu makes me smile. Depending on the time of day you go, the quality of food and service changes. The best times to visit are breakfast and lunch...anytime before 3pm. Something seems to happen to the freshness and the attitudes of the employees as the day goes by. My favorite item is the veggie sandwhich w avocado no cheese on the black pepper focaccia (which is all vegan friendly as well). The new herbal ice teas are refreshing as well. Now, I wish they served my garden vegetable soup year around....as of now it's seasonal.  The black bean soup is among the best."}
{"text":"I am very happy that panera is cleaning up their act. It's the reason I stopped eating there. However,It pays to know the ingredients in a place that is now bragging about how \"clean\" their menu is becoming.Management gets a super fail on this one. But we finally got it all together. After having the ingredients found for me, I had them remake my sandwich on a clean bread item. I had a veggie sandwich on the black pepper focaccia with the vegetable soup and chips and herbal tea....it was yummy! Make sure you ask for a clean item if this is a concern, because the chain is still cleaning up locations and all have not arrived just yet. But I love where they are going!"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review of this Panera bread based on feedback I got from the staff at the Quality Inn in which this Panera Bread resides. 

This Panera was convenient for breakfast, mainly because it was in the same building as a Quality Inn which does not serve breakfast. There is even a special elevator stop in the building for it (press \"R\"). It's quite large - plenty of seating. I have no idea if it gets crowded during lunch or dinner but it's pretty quiet at breakfast. Maybe people aren't enthused about their breakfasts. I know I'm pretty \"meh\" about it. A lot of their breakfasts are sandwiches on ciabatta or a bagel.  I asked if I could substitute a different kind of bagel than advertised for a particular sandwich (turkey sausage, egg white, avocado) and was told yes. I asked for an onion bagel but got an everything bagel. Maybe they don't have onion bagels, I didn't check the bin before ordering, but it would have been nice if the person who waited on me clarified. Also, I was not aware - because you can't see it when coming in from the elevator - that the coffee is in carafes in the dining area. Had I known that, I would have bought a small instead of a large and simply gotten a free refill. The sandwich was otherwise ok except that they flattened the bagel.  On this particular visit, the soda machine was also broken. So if you wanted water, you couldn't get free tap water by pressing the lever on the soda machine, you had to buy bottled water. 

The Quality Inn in which this Panera resides maintains they are not allowed to provide their breakfast - and had to get an exemption from Choice Hotels because of it - because whoever owns this Panera Bread appears unwilling to negotiate some kind of deal with the hotel regarding breakfast. That's too bad. Had I known about this, I definitely would have looked for the more interesting independently run restaurants or diners in the area. If you're staying at the Quality Inn, you're better off looking elsewhere for breakfast."}
{"text":"PSA for the day:
Don't let Panera's claim to have gluten \"conscious\" bakery fool you! It's NOT gluten free, which I found out the hard way after only 2 bites. Their version of gluten \"conscious\" bakery is not meant for people who can't eat gluten (celiac disease or wheat allergies), which is not specified on the signs or labels in their store. You have to look at the fine print on their printed catering menu. Thanks for the gut ache, Panera!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The food waa delicious and filling. It is a lot healthier than a burger or something like that. The girls working were really nice too. We did get a tiny bit confused bc they give you a number and the tables have numbers. Apparently its not assigned seating lol. Got a delicious half sandwich half salad and it came with French bread. Got a really good pastry at the end for only $0.99."}
{"text":"Panera Bread is just OK to me. I really don't understand the hype behind it which is why I generally don't eat here to often. Last night I was craving a good salad and sand which. Was being pretty lazy and Panera Bread was really the only thing open around my area. So I stopped in and waited for about 5 minutes until I had to walk up to the counter on the other side and ask if anybody was taking orders. Not very attentive to your customers I see.. The girl who took my order was somewhat helpful with my questions on certain items on the menu. I would say overall my experience could've been better and also I would say that the meal was pretty basic. $18 later I almost feel like I should've drove a little further for something different."}
{"text":"Super fast takeout service. My food was still warm and delicious by the time I got back to my hotel. Definitely better than the average panera chain that you run into.  :-)"}
{"text":"I love this place! Probably my most visited place! I go there after my classes end on weekdays and sometimes get to go orders on the weekend. It is really just comfort and healthy foods that really makes you full without the feeling of being stuffed. My favorite is ordering the Cream of Chicken and Wild Rice soup not saying that the other items on the menu isn't good enough, just that this soup reminds me of how my mom used to make it when I got sick. The place is homey and comfortable. My table is 37! 

A little trick or you may know this already, I know it gets busy during lunch and dinner time, so I order my food online through their app or website, then I place it as dining in and pick my table, so I don't have to wait and order in line or their iPad."}
{"text":"Always have great service when we are here. The food is served quickly, the drink stations are clean, the food is fresh and tastes good, and the staff there are very pleasant. Occasionally the food order will be wrong."}
{"text":"This location always get my To go sand which orders incorrect. I don't understand what the point is of being able to edit your sand which when the kitchen never reads the order. The fountain area is not that clean, there's water dripping everywhere from all over the fountain. I had some water fall on my foot, hoping it's all clean."}
{"text":"Was pretty upset to come here sick just wanting a sandwich and soup, not knowing they put mustard and mayo on every sandwich without telling you. Wasn't going to be the person to send back the food but if your going to put something on a sandwich you should put it on your menu."}
{"text":"It's Panera... Chain food. Consistent though.  Sandwiches aren't anything to write home about.  Service is friendly,  great location with lots of seating. 
However With many other ethnic places to eat in our multi cultural city down town,  I'd prefer to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was prompted to visit due to the free bagel promotion (advertised free bagel every day this month via an email campaign) and was absolutely disappointed.  I literally begged by boyfriend to drive out of his way to visit Panera (he had never been) and I raved about how amazing this place was.   Regrettably, I was wrong. We arrived to the establishment and I ordered a bagel with cream cheese.  I mentioned to the attendant that I was here for the complimentary bagel promotion.   My boyfriend then asked the counter attendant to put my order on his tab, and proceeded to order a specialty sandwich and chips, along with a bagel to go (since they were advertising 1 free bagel per customer).  I had a feeling this might interfere with the promotion (since both our bagels were going to be listed on the same order), so before we checked out, I asked the girl, \"both bagels qualify for the promo, right?\" she told me yes, and with a swipe of his credit card--and gratuity that we chose to add, we ended up paying for my bagel anyway!  I noticed this as we were finding a table, so he went back to the counter and talked to the counter attendant.  She said she thought she'd mentioned that they had to be on separate orders previously, and did not refund the dollar.  Really??  It might sound silly, but to me service is everything.  It wasn't the measly dollar that upset me so much as the principle of the situation--ESPECIALLY because I made a point to ask the girl before we paid for our food(!)  Bravo to Panera's marketing team for employing such ingenious advertising tactics; they would have earned several loyal customers including myself, my boyfriend and potentially countless others whom I may come into contact with.  In theory a great marketing idea, but in practice, nothing excuses poor customer service.  Sadly, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I used to work at this Panera.

Do not go here: the food is not safe to eat because it isn't properly kept cold (like the salad lettuce i.e), most of the employees behind the counter do not go above and beyond for their customers because they do not care, and the management is a mess because they have a lot of expired food in the back of the house that who knows if someone uses it or not plus they're just rude. The thing that bothers me is the amount of apathy for the store overall, it's awful."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a number of times and I have to say I love their food.  There is always plenty of parking and I love the kiosk that allow me to order my own food at my own pace.  It's usually prepared rapidly which is another plus.


The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because Panera is overpriced.  For the same price of some of their salads, I can go to sit down restaurant like Flower Child and get organic and fresh salads larger in size.  Panera is more of a fast food place with sit down restaurant prices.  I also gave them 4 stars over 5 because whenever I order something to eat and get it to go, I usually request the dinner roll or apple.  But for some reason they keep forgetting to put it in there. They've only ever remembered 1 time.  But repeatedly forgetting my free apple or roll is no reason to quit going.  For now I like the place."}
{"text":"Horrible experience, even if you reach out to their customer service there is no response, will not eat at any Panera's again!"}
{"text":"Really friendly staff, very helpful. I've only been here for breakfast. The food is alright, but definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Great for a quick breakfast.  The croissants are quite large, and the bagels are fresh and chewy.  It took very little time for the food to be ready.  I would go back to try lunch at some point."}
{"text":"Food is food but maybe try another Panera Bread! Employees on strike sign outside, construction loudly drilling during lunch time, and when I got to the get front of the line and asked the cashier about the pick 2 meal she rudely replied you just pick 2 with an attitude like she was annoyed to explain the menu! Wow never coming here again! Unfortunately this was a work lunch with my coworker so I was not able to just leave but had it not be I would have!  I would never spend my money here with, this service."}
{"text":"I like Panera Bread, but this particular location always seems to get my order wrong 4 out 5 times. Something is always missing that I've paid extra for, my salads have come with no dressing kind of a pain to go back to get the right order. The people are super friendly, but I would like to enjoy a meal that isn't incorrect for once."}
{"text":"Poor service! My daughters and I were looking for something to eat and they threw out Panera. OK, so we started calling to place a phone order so we can pick up and go. Made several phone calls between 7:35-7:50. There answering machine says their peak times are between 6-7. Finally arrived and as I was looking for a spot to park, notice there was no one in line and one person waiting for there food. I was walking up and see 6 team members gathered around I believe was the manager. She was not wearing the black uniform everyone else was wearing. They were all gathered around her with her phone, talking and laughing. As I approach to place my order I ask the cashier (Kaymarie) what was going on and why no one was answering the phone. She goes on to state what the answering machine days, they don't answer during peak hours. I told her I know between 6-7 and it is 7:50. The other cashier with blonde hair standing next to her rolls her eyes at me. Told her that was great customer service to roll your eyes to someone that is going to eat your establishment. Kaymarie apologized again to me and offered some free cookies and I told her she didn't have to worry about it. My girls love this place and we often visit for their turkey chilli and sandwiches. Told them I'm no longer going to give my money to a business that doesn't have good customer service. So heated that I knew if I talked to the manager it would not be good. If Panera wants to know who may have been on that shift, my Check Number was 210515. 

I'm all for having some fun and laughs in the work place. It should not come at the expense of customer service. Maybe its time for their top manager or GM to sit them down and have a meeting about customer service. 

Kaymarie, appreciate the apology and the offer of cookies. Hopefully you can train your co-worker to own a mistake instead of rolling her eyes.

{"text":"Extremely rude... I ordered a dirty chi tea. Never have been to a panera that did not know what that was. I was given a regular chi tea. Not a problem.. I went to the counter and ask nicely to give me the correct order. The manager laura said \"we are not Starbucks...we don't know what that is\" and gave me a dirty look. I explained that it was an added shot of espresso and that I have never been to starbucks. She walked away and gave me back my drink about 5 minutes later slammed it on the counter and walked away. If you don't have people skills don't be a manager. I should add that i am a manager at a restaurant   I would never treat a guest this way and if my staff did they would be let go immediately."}
{"text":"My first EVER visit to Panera! I'm probably the only person in America who hadn't been here yet. Well now I am one of the happy, carb filled masses.

My mom and I came here on Sunday morning to grab a quick bite to sustain some last minute gambling at Green Valley. I thought my Turkey Sausage and Potato souffle was tasty, if a bit dinky in size. I also didn't notice any potatoes. My mom's breakfast panini was much more substantial and I was slightly jealous.

A lot of their menu sounds really good, but don't be like me and check out the nutritional stats online when you get home or you and your thighs will be sorry. Trust me!"}
{"text":"We love this place.... great staff, Ary, Hannah, except for Nick. He's arrogant and rude, and should put a smile on his face as well and be a little more courteous. Otherwise, great place. :-)"}
{"text":"Location still has Paradise Bakery logo on it. But the menu and everything is being switched to Panera."}
{"text":"Always enjoyed eating here back in the Midwest...now that it's AZ I still enjoy my favorite soup here.  THe Cream of Chicken and Wild rice (available only on Tuesday and Thursday)"}
{"text":"Went to Panera today with my son and ordered a kids grilled cheese and a turkey/avocado sandwich. My sandwich was pretty bland but not bad. Needs seasoning or something with more flavor. The blood orange lemonade is okay but I taste more carrot than lemon or orange. 

The issue I have is that my son ate the apple provided with his sandwich and then took a few small bites of the grilled cheese, but then he made a face and ran to the restroom where he was sick. I followed him in and helped him recover before speaking to an associate about it. I don't know if it was the apple or the sandwich but my money is on the sandwich because I ate an apple too. Manager gave me a refund on the giftcard we used, but I am not going to return to Panera. What also adds insult to this is that the manager commented on how my son looked fine and that it takes 24 hours for any type of food poisoning to set in. I said she wasn't a doctor to which I got a response of \"I was a nurse for 27 years.\" I don't care if you are a former nurse, but you work at a restaurant now and you can't diagnose illnesses as a manager or as a nurse anyways. Very unappreciative and makes me wonder why she no longer works as a nurse and decided to work in a third-rate restaurant. I will always recommend WildFlower Bread over Panera. It's a terrible shame too because Panera used to be decent until they bought out Paradise Bakery. Now the quality and care has drastically declined..."}
{"text":"Ordered a drink and dessert and from what I can see it's really awesome. Friendly employees and it's a nice change of pace from the other fare available in the mall. Not really too much else to say about it other than it's nice."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would.  Every single time I come here, our orders are messed up.  The staff in the afternoon shift are extremely rude.  At night around 1900, the staff are super friendly.  I don't think anyone should eat here until 1900.  Horrible horrible customer service.  In fact, I don't even think it's worth coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I would like to be able to give a good review but the price is killing me. I ordered the Vegan Lentil Quinoa Bowl. I'd heard it was delicious. Priced at $8.79 a bowl, I was not only expecting delicious, but a generous portion. It was delicious. The portion was ridiculous. My \"bowl\" was about a measured cup of soup. I would have been embarrassed to serve that after charging over $9 with tax."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a try and had not been since paradise was taken over.  I got the chicken Chipotle melt and a drink and sadly no option for a cookie as my side....  I am not sure why but the kiosk asks if you want to add a tip?  I only get a sandwich handed to me, why are they asking for a tip?  Are we supposed to begin tipping the people at McDonalds?  I got my sandwich delivered to me by a man who never bothered to talk to me .  He did make sure to ask the table next to me if they needed anything and was very friendly with them but I guess he has a thing against men because it was a table of all women.  The sandwich stunk... it reminded me of the canned chicken I can get at costco and had no real Chipotle flavor but a lot of cilantro, so I guess that counts in their eyes...  

I wouldn't recommend this at all.  Bring back the sandwiches people liked and stop trying to be hip.  Also offer a dang cookie as an option instead of chips or a baguette.  Also train your male staff who bring the food to the table because they are either racist or sexist."}
{"text":"Minor issue with Togo order. After speaking to the Store Manager Dakota via phone. After arriving to the restaurant employees went above and beyond. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice looking store, and I'm sure(maybe?) a lot of what they serve is delicious.. but we just did not have any luck. 
This Panera is part of an Interstate highway travel stop that's almost like a mini mall slash food court. The panera was large and moderately busy in the middle of the day.
We ordered one ice tea and one coffee. The ice tea tasted like homeopathic remedies (ie plain water with nothing in it), and my relative traveling with me said that her coffee was the first time in her life that she'd actually dumped coffee out because of how undrinkable it was. 
Prices weren't that great either."}
{"text":"Well this location managed to live up to their poor rating. It took me 20 minutes to receive my \"you pick two\" which is uncharacteristic of Panera and when I finally received it, it was wrong. I didn't have time to get it remade so I ate it as is. The food was still tasty though earning two stars."}
{"text":"We can here for a quick bite, got two sausage breakfast sandwiches, an iced latte and a hot mocha.

The sandwich tasted off... there was something wrong with the egg, cheese, or sausage. 

The mocha was decent, nothing spectacular. We didn't try the iced latte until we left. This is what really angered me.. there was no espresso or any caffeine in it and the milk was sour!!! I was so angry about this!! Guess what 3 hours later and food poisoning kicked in! I had to notify the health district, not sure what's going on at this particular Panera Bread but the other ones seem to be a  bit more on top of their game

I will not come back to this one"}
{"text":"I've never been so dissatisfied & disgusted in my life... I often come to Panera bread & have an enjoyable time with great food but the food sucked. i got a Broccoli cheddar soup which had powdered cheese in it that wasn't even melted  the bread was ice cold and stale I asked for new piece of bread and they gave me the same exact cold piece stale bread and then told me to microwave it on my own.. I got the avocado spicy chicken chipotle melt and I was completely disgusted my chicken was undercooked pink and raw the bread was stale and it had old watery tomatoes.. i felt so sick to my stomach i threw up. I will NEVER eat here or at any panera again this location completely ruined my expectations."}
{"text":"I have noticed a trending issue at this location.  Often, my order is incorrect.  I know this is not Burger King, but I would like to have my food my way since I paid for it.  I don't have time to do your job, and check behind my order each time to see if you gave me all my items, and if I have everything on my sandwich etc...  I have my own job! I also get very tired of sitting in the drive thru for excessive amounts of time.  You guys charge quite a bit for some of these small portion sizes.  I ordered a sandwich today, it did not have any of the stuff it was supposed to on it. I was also missing items as well.  I decided that it was not worth it to drive back over to get my order corrected, and it is also not worth it for me to come back to this location, ever.  I would like to suggest working on your time management, and not having your customers waiting excessive amounts of time in the drive thru.  Why even have one? Also, check the customers order before presenting it to them.  You supposedly pride yourself on accuracy.  I have found that your definition of accuracy is quite distorted."}
{"text":"I have been to Panera several times and have never really been super impressed or super unimpressed.  I suppose it has always just met my expectations.  Today I ordered the Italian Sub sandwich and French Onion Soup.  First of all, do not call the Italian Sub a Sub.  It comes on a sub looking roll but I suppose technically that must be a french roll as the cashier had not a clue to what I was trying to order.  It is called the Italian.  If you tell them you want an Italian, they will know what you are talking about. 

So, if you have Bread in your name, (Panera BREAD) you would think the bread would be the star.  The bread on my sandwich was cold and so I would assume it was in the refrigerator.  It also had that taste that bread gets when it comes out of the refrigerator.   A sandwich is not difficult to make.  I can make it myself at home with bread that comes out of the refrigerator. I was not looking for that.  I was looking for a sandwich with fresh bread. 

Moving on to the French Onion Soup...It was amazing.  Incredible depth of flavor with a hint of booze, possibly sherry and lots of tender onions.  Ordering French Onion soup can be hit or miss.  I have had my share of French Onion Soup that tasted like dog water with onions but this was not the case.  My only gripe would be that there was no traditional piece of bread/crouton on top with melted cheese. Honestly I quickly forgot about that omission as the soup was that good.  It is on the menu on Monday nights and I will definitely be back for that."}
{"text":"Free Wi-Fi!  Woohoo!

Yeah, they also have food here.  The food's also good - very good.  If you've never had this place, you're missing out.  Yes, I know it's a chain.

This is a healthier alternative to fast food.  I got some chipotle chicken sandwich, I think, and that came with chips (which I had replaced with an apple) and a drink.  They make their own bread here and cook everything themselves.  The best part about this place is the bread, in my opinion.  No chain marketed by Jared Fogle or singing gerbils - or whatever the hell Quizno's was trying to do with that ad campaign - can match the quality and the taste of the food here, especially the bread.  It's cooked perfectly, too.

If you come here, you'll feel like less of a fat-ass.  That's a promise."}
{"text":"Super irritated right now !! Went to panera ordered over the phone got a half of a sandwich and a half of a salad. I asked for extra dressing get all the way home and there is NO dressing !! I called them gave them my receipt number and the manager looks it up and says oh yeah it does say extra dressing smh. Good job. $15 for dry ass salad. They said they would deliver some dressing let's see how long this takes... So they ended up bringing the dressing which I appreciate. But still check your order save yourself some frustration."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this location of Panera. The catering service is HORRIBLE. The woman in charge of it is spastic, rude and unprofessional. 
Today I had an egg soufflé and there was a dark hair in it - not a hair from someone's head either. I wanted to throw up when I saw it. 
Please save yourself the time & trouble and go to another location. Panera isn't cheap so having a good experience makes it worth the cost. The Indian Trail location will not provide that."}
{"text":"Great food and good service. Very good coffee and excellent atmosphere. I really love Panera bread. Great pastry's and best macaroni and cheese ever."}
{"text":"Ordered:
You pick two: Greek salad and Macaroni and Cheese

I ordered the food ahead of time and the food was ready for pick up within 10 minutes. That was definitely a positive for me. Service on the other hand is different from the previous location I use to go to. I'm use to walking in and being greeted by an employee. For this location, I passed by two employees while walking in and then out and was not greeted or thanked once. Off day? Possibly. I'll still come back though because they got my food ready to go in a short time period."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Staff is friendly. Anaya rocks!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE 

I ORDERED TAKEOUT AND HATED THE SLIMY POORLY PREPARED SOUP.  I DIDNT EAT IT

TBE SALd dressing had after taste like stevia and I threw the entire salad out 

Yesterday I brought back containers and receipt

The evening manager was defiant to offer me any replacement or monetary refund

His attitude was shockingly indifferent to sustained satisfaction

Their good tastes like institutional commissary food like that of my relatives nursing home 

I guess the low rating of this company indicates many unsatisfied customers

Simply pathetic!"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed their breakfast. I gave 3 stars because I feel they need to train their employees about food safety and sanitation. The young lady making several sandwiches today, touched her hair and adjusted her hat with gloves on 5 times in less than 2 minutes. Had she had any training she would know that is how foodborne pathogens are spread."}
{"text":"Poorly managed. Went in to get a sandwich at 12:25 pm on a Saturday and they had no bread! Maybe they should change their name. Not our first bad experience here. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"It's a busy day at this location with multiple teenage basket ball teams dining in, but the young woman working the dining room, Lynn, is rockin it! She has been so sweet, friendly, and attentive, and her customer service is very personalized for each person. You can tell she is a genuinely caring woman, and she has made my day. I'm about to head out now, and my hope is that I can be a Lynn to someone today. Thanks girl!"}

{"text":"Going downhill FAST.
I work in the Winston Business Park, I've been to this location and it's getting worse and worse.  
My usual is the chicken cobb with avacado salad.  The salad used to be nicely presented, lots of dressing, ingredients chopped.
Today, 2 - 1/4 full containers of dressing, my avacado was in 2 large hunks on top of my salad (and it was partially brown) and my egg was in 2 halves in the salad.  These items used to come chopped or sliced (as you would expect with a cobb).  The salad itself also seems to be getting smaller.  I may have to find a new lunch place.  This is just getting disappointing."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with the rising price and the decreasing quality of panera bread over the times. I always picks 2 items and the tastes are great, however the sizes are half compared to what I was getting before! it is supposed to be a fast food restaurant, and they are asking for voluntary tips! It is wrong and even though it is an elegant restaurant and good food, I just dont think they should manipulate customers. I am so disappointed at my steak sandwich, it was not a half cut, it was a quarter cut! I am a small girl, but a girl gotta eat. I will never come back to panera bread again as their reward program is useless, and I would rather spend my money at chipotle and other places who serves food generously and with integrity!"}
{"text":"I like this panera but sometimes the cashiers are a little young and you can't take their word for suggestions. 

Most of the time the lines aren't long and they offer the same thing all the other Panera's do. The dining area is quaint and spacious but sometimes it can get crowded when students are there studying. 

My favorite is the chicken and wild rice soup. Their coffee is good too."}
{"text":"Came in during lunch- obviously they are busy! EACH AND EVERYONE OF THE EMPLOYEES were fast fun friendly and courteous! I do not mind waiting! I think those characteristics of an employee during a peak time says a lot for the leadership of the team! Thanks for lunch! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I don't typically review restaurants like this (chains, or ones I frequent weekly), but I love Panera.  It started out as a place where I could easily take my busy toddler, but not be subject to a greasy lunch.  Years later, my son and I make a visit to this Panera every.single.weekend.  It's our lunch date mothership.

The food is pretty good, IMO.  I most often get the broccoli cheese soup, chicken and wild rice soup, steak/arugula sandwich, chicken caesar salad (really, any of their salads!), napa chicken salad sandwich, avocado BLT, asiago bagel, mediterranean flatbread, and if I'm early enough - I love their savoury soufflés.  The only things I haven't enjoyed are the hot chocolate, thai wonton bowl and the basic turkey sandwich.  

I guess I could be classified as a regular, which always makes the service special.  The staff are SO nice, and they love my kid.  I'm always greeted with a smile and some small talk.  Big shout outs to Nicole (who no longer works there, cry), William and Cindy.  They are all so nice and I enjoy seeing them on my visits.  

My only really complaint about Panera is that people come in on the weekends, during the lunch rush, and set up their laptops, BUY NOTHING, and hog the tables.  Management told me they can't do anything about it -- they aren't allowed to ask people to vacate.  I think that's annoying but at the same time, any time I've ordered with intentions to eat in the restaurant, they've found a way to get me seated.  

Coffee is REALLY good.  They have pastries and cookies, but I'm really there for the savoury options."}
{"text":"Had this Panera cater an event at the Red Cross. Everything was delivered on time, and everything was fresh! They did a great job. Recommend for any catering event."}
{"text":"Can you believe that a toasted bagel is not available because their only toaster is \"broken\" this morning? Neither could I."}
{"text":"Extremely terrible service. Three girl standing near the cash registers but they tell me only one is working and she is filling up bags for to-go orders and does not take my order after 7 Minutes of me standing there. I will not repeat my visit here"}
{"text":"This store is open 24/7 and after living in Japan for 2 years this was the obvious choice! Had some trouble ordering through the app with rapid pickup. This store is new and had a promotion with a free cookie though rapid pick up as well as $3 off $6 or more purchase. Ordered myself a bacon turkey bravo which was delicious! Then I tried the rapid pick up which never went through but the staff this morning on October 22 at 3:39am were so kind enough to pay for my Mediterranean egg white. Great service! Will definitely come by this place if I'm in the area again"}
{"text":"Great customer service here! The cashier saw me eyeing the free brownie sample and offered it to me. The food isn't as salty as it used to be so that's a plus. I ordered the autumn squash soup and it's good but not amazing. The base tastes like the Campbell's grocery kind. I tried the new turkey/Apple/walnut bread sandwich, it's really dry, needs some form of mayonnaise. Would probably still come again to panera and keep trying different dishes."}
{"text":"First time here and we loved it. My daughter had a blueberry bagel with peanut butter,  my son had chicken noodle soup with a sliced apple on the side, and my husband and I had a chicken avacado Cobb salad. Food was fresh, healthy, and tasty!!"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in they have kiosks so you can bypass the line. I decided to try it even though there was no line. It asked for my Panera card which I do not have. If you don't have it they want you to sign up which would be perfect if I wasn't already a member. There was no option to enter my phone number. I walked away and decided to order from the table on my app. The first table I sat at number 38 was sticky so I moved two tables down. The app asked for my table number. Easy enough. Ordering on the app was super easy. I was able to redeem my free bagel coupon which the people at the counter can never find. You can pay off the app which is a plus. The only thing I don't like is that it asks if you would like to leave a tip. I chose not to because I haven't received the service yet. My food was delivered by Caleb who was super polite and well mannered. I think I just found my newest way to order from here. You guys rock!!!"}
{"text":"I used to frequently visit the Panera Bread on Fort Apache and Tropicana. I loved the casual setting and even more so was satisfied with the food. 

When I found out that a Panera Bread was opening up in Boca Park, I was ecstatic! Another option on the list for a hang out/eatery in the area made me a happy gal. I went on a lazy Sunday late afternoon to meet and dine with a friend. The restaurant itself is huge with lots of seating. Lots and lots of it, it's twice the size of the one on Fort Apache and Tropicana. They also have an outside patio area for customers to use. 

I always get the You Pick Two deal which include any two from their soups, half a salad or half a sandwich. Depending on the salad or the sandwich, this deal will run you about $8-$10. I got their Spinach Power salad (mushrooms, egg, onions, bacon and spinach in an onion vinaigrette) and French Onion Soup with a side of bread. Portions were good and tasted delicious. 

This place has free wifi! So if you're looking for a hangout spot, a study spot, a grub spot, or just a spot to sit and stare, this is the place! I really appreciate that this place popped up here because there are a lot of instances where I would have to turn away from Sambalatte because there wouldn't be anywhere to sit to get some work done! I'm not saying Panera is my second option to Sambalatte, but I'm glad I now have another option."}
{"text":"I come to this place at least 3-4 times per week.  I'll say I love that they have free wifi for business.  The only thing I would say is I wish they had a little better coffee.  Their food is great, shows the calories on the menu, and it's a business friendly environment.  If they just got better coffee, this place would rock!"}
{"text":"There is nothing else really good to eat in this area, so it is great this place is here.  Usually here once a week for YP2 or oatmeal.  All the food is great.  Not a fan at all of any of the drinks, but for the price you will be filled with something fairly healthy and fresh."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Had steak sandwich and cinnamon bun with chips to take to movies.  You get what you pay for here!"}
{"text":"First time going and it was awesome the food was ready last in 10 minutes and the restaurant was really clean so I don't know why people complain about it so much!!!"}
{"text":"Leo F - I wish I would have written this before you visited 28 minutes ago. I was there this morning at 6:35 a.m. - first one in the lobby. Girl at register looked completely surprised and annoyed she had to put her phone down to wait on me. Not a smile - barely a \"good morning\". After I popped in for my unscheduled order of: 18 bagels, a ring of pastry and originally 1 dozen scones - they only had 7 available- I got a quick \"I would call the night before\" by Andrea the Asst manager AND I got a half roll of the eyes. I kid you not! It was like she was aggravated that I wiped out the 7 scones in the case. It's Wednesday morning! How many do they sell a day?!  As I was called get my order, I noticed the bagels were thrown in a large paper bag. AFTER they were IN the bag I was asked by the cashier if I wanted them sliced or toasted!  All the other Panera restaurants I have been in (or most McDonald's even) would make this joint look like the Taj Mahal. I will never go back.  The staff is awful and shame on the General Manager for allowing this location to continue to have crummy employees."}
{"text":"Manager Alex answered the phone after I was upset regarding the customer service at the Mall Ring Circle location.   I explained my disbelief with her and she assured me everything was going to get taken care of at her location.  After sending my order through email, she called and told me she received it, gave me a total, and confirmed my pick up time.   When I arrived she gave me a free drink for the wait and off I was.  When arriving back at work, I see they followed my request by bagging everyone order individually and with their names on their bags.   Way to go Alex and team.  I will send everyone I know from CCSD your way!!"}
{"text":"Great Panera Bread. Had the soup and Sammy which is always yummy. The service was friendly and on point. Drinks and teas was full even though it was close to closing down. For dessert we split a bear claw which tasted fresh and was a perfect semi sweet treat.  Gotta love Panera bread!"}
{"text":"Excellent salads and the staff is most gracious. They ignore the men's bathroom, but not a deal breaker for me."}
{"text":"It's a Panera Bread so you know in advance what you're gonna get. However, compared to many of the others I've been to, this one is quite small, uncrowded (YEP! Even at lunch time!), and efficient. I even had the Manager wait on me this time. As you probably know, if you venture into a Panera any time around 11:30 or 12:00 hoping to grab a \"quick lunch\", you're gonna wait. Wait in line, wait for your food, wait for a place to sit... Something about Panera Bread that encourages people to sit around and chat, check their email on the free wifi, have meetings, conduct interviews, etc. Makes for a congested, often overcrowded atmosphere. In the 4-5 times I've been to this location, none of that has happened. Same food, same benefits, same everything. Except the crowds. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Panera? Great concept, free wi-fi, decent lunch offerings and good soup. I just am sad to see that they've all decided to eliminate the sample stand that used to great you as you walked in. It was great to grab a piece of bagel or artisan bread as you contemplated your prospective lunch selection. This location is convenient for me and former co-workers (mostly all retirees!) and we set up lunches here to visit and shoot the breeze. It's always packed and it can be tough to get a seat. The pick two is usually how I roll and get half a sandwich and a bowl of soup. It used to be a great deal but prices have steadily gone up and I barely have enough change from a $10 bill to rattle around in my pocket. Food is tasty, atmosphere is conducive to conversation, and its location is convenient right off the turnpike/parkway."}
{"text":"Panera sucks. It was better when it was Paradise Bakery. I like being able to watch them make my food. Since that went away, the service declined. I would like the order kiosks if it had everything that was on the menu. I dont understand why it wouldn't have everything that the menu behind the counter has but it's super irritating. I just got something today because the sole cashier that was working was super slow and I was hungry so I got a different salad than I actually waned simply because it was on the kiosk menu."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try since we've seen their ads all over TV, magazines, and billboards. We found the only table available for 4 people. It still had dishes from a previous customer so I asked an employee if they could have it cleaned up. He said he'd have someone do it right away. Nobody came so after a few minutes we just did it ourselves. They were pretty busy so no big deal.

We chose the half chipotle chicken avocado sandwich and the Cobb salad. I also added in the sweet corn chowder to share with my girlfriend. The soup was too sweet for my taste. I prefer a more chicken stock based soup with cream/milk and corn. The Cobb was pretty bland but they go light on the dressing which I don't mind. It's nice and healthy. The sandwich was good. Bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. You could tell it was freshly baked. 

Overall a decent experience but nothing to write home about. Maybe we'll come back and try something new on the menu."}
{"text":"As much as I want to hate Panera, I just can't.  I tend to hate chain restaurants, but Panera is my weakness.  Damn you Panera.  Another day of good soup and a tasty sandwich, served quickly and efficiently.  One day I wish you would just screw the pooch and deliver something awful so I can live out my dream of openly hating you.  But not today.  You delivered another tasty lunch."}
{"text":"Judging at the previous reviews. This is the worst branch that I just so happen to go to. Everything was overpriced, portions were tiny, big plate, brownie sized sandwiches this place needs a overhaul. 

I fear for a similar experience. I will never come to this franchise ever again goodbye."}
{"text":"Every time I show up at this location I am buying a bucket of pastries.   I always get excellent service.   The service is fast and painless.

I know I have personally increased the stretchy pants demand in the region :-)"}
{"text":"Panera Bread is the newest addition to dining choices in Boca Park. This location provides some very comfortable seating. There are several dining areas with various seating options such booths small and large tables. The decorations are pleasing and the background music fits right in. There are 2 outdoor patios with umbrellas.
On our visit there was no line at the counter and once we placed the order the food was delivered to our table in less than 5 minutes. Great service with a smile. The dining room was almost filled to capacity. Depending on your level of hunger there are a number of choices, soups, salads, sandwiches. We had the French Onion soup which was very good with a nice sweetness to the onions. Also the chicken caesar salad and turkey sandwich are winners. This location continues Panera Breads tradition."}
{"text":"I go to this panera on a regular basis and I've never had any issues. Always great service and the food is consistently good. I went there this morning for a Mediterranean Egg White breakfast sandwich, got it to go, and drove to work. When I looked at it I thought it looked like it was missing some of the ingredients, the only thing I saw was spinach and egg white. When I bit into it my suspicion was confirmed, there were no tomatoes and the ingredients that were on it were very limited. The sandwich was pretty much just ciabatta and egg white, very dry, and tasteless. I'll definitely return to this location because it's really close to my work, but it wasn't even busy when I was there. No reason to be forgetting ingredients."}
{"text":"It was my first time ordering from this panera and I will go out of my way to never order food from here again. 
First of all, I got a half Mediterranean veggie sandwich and I paid to add avocado. There was maybe an eight or an avocado on my sandwich. 
Secondly, I ordered a cup of autumn squash soup. They gave me a cup of chicken noodle. 
I'm livid because that soup was the primary reason I went to panera, and they gave me chicken noodle. 
Honestly this franchise has gone downhill. I don't know if I'll ever go to panera again after my recent poor experiences. 
Everyone: DONT go to this panera if you must go to a panera. I would recommend cafe zuppas, they've never had a wrong order for me and their food is better."}
{"text":"This is the Bainbridge area incarnation of the Panera Bread chain opened within the last two years.  Panera is located in the plaza next to Heinen's along E. Washington St. (old 422).

Panera's menu offers many wholesome sandwich ingredient options, fresh breads, chai / tea drinks, and more.  

The store decor offers an upbeat yet relaxing interior with pastel colors, wall art, and comfortable seats and the staff takes good care in keeping the counters, furniture, and carpets clean and in good condition.  Definitely a nice place for quiet meals, studying, and Internet usage especially during the off-peak periods.

Very popular for its free Wi-Fi (limited to 30 min during lunch hour)."}
{"text":"I'm really into health. I'm also really into the idea of not feeling like crap after I consume food. Their [fairly new] Mediterranean quinoa salad is a complete grand champion. I highly recommend it to anyone who cares about their body and cares to give their taste buds a borderline foodgasm."}
{"text":"Delicious salads, sandwiches and soups! Fantastic, frothy chai lattes! Great atmosphere, variety of table options, and friendly service. Free wifi, though limited during busy times.

Calorie contents are readily available and very reasonable for a restaurant. 

The Cream of Chicken and Wild Rice soup is my all time favourite menu item. They would deserve a definite 5 stars if they would have it all the time, instead of only 4 days a week and often running out on those days, leaving me frequently disappointed when I visit. :-("}
{"text":"Great fresh food though a bit expensive but everything always taste fresh and good. My favorite bread is the baguette.  Friendly service and they always get my order right! I wish they had more salad selections like chef salad or southwest salad."}

{"text":"Order is always wrong!  Went here 3 times already & each time, they messed up on my order! I'm done with this place!"}
{"text":"I work in the plaza and eat in the area often.  I've given this location several chances, as have my coworkers, and everyone has given up.  They forgot egg on my Mediterranean EGG sandwich......   Come on, it's in the name.  Save your money, go to Chipotle a few stores down.  Cheaper and consistently good."}
{"text":"It was Sunday morning and we did not feel like making breakfast, so we went out and decided to try Panera Bread for breakfast.

It was an excellent decision.  Panera has a good selection of sandwiches, pastries and drinks and we were very happy with their service. 

The atmosphere was very relaxed and the cafe was very large and thoughtfully decorated.

I ordered the Asiago bacon and egg breakfast sandwich and my love ordered the spinach, egg white and avocado sandwich.  We also got a hot chocolate with big marshmallows!

The food was tasty and we received good service.  I enjoyed my bacon and egg sandwich and when I tried a bite of the avacado sandwich it was also good.  The hot chocolate was slightly too sweet but I liked the marshmallows and the presentation.

Overall, good (almost excellent) food, excellent service and excellent atmosphere at Panera gave me very positive experience at a very good cafe.  3.9 / 5.0"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Portions are little smaller than ideal for the price, but the quality is pretty good.  My only complaint is that I got cut in line by some guy who literally just walked in front of our 10 person line, and several employees and the cashier just continued to serve him by asking him for his order.  Other than that, the employees range from adequate to people that could care less. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Paradise bakery was better definitely miss that cookie with my pick any 2 and it's  pricier now ."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Panera bread - however after visiting today, now I know why I used to go there quite a bit.

Being more health conscious these days, it is not just about where you eat, but WHAT you eat.  I find that Panera bread has a lot of tasteful selections that still allow you to meat your health/nutritional goals.

What I opted in today for was the \"You Choose two\" menu:

- Half Asian Sesame Chicken Salad (200 cals,10g fat)
- Half Smoked Turkey Breast on Country Sandwich (280 cals, 7g fat)

My third item I got on the side was an apple.

The salad was very good.  Fresh, off-the-grill chicken with: the romaine lettuce, almonds, crispy wonton strips and sesame vinaigrette was very flavorful and did not disappoint.

The Smoked Turkey Sandwich was equally satisfying.  This half sandwich was more like a full one portion-wise.  The sandwich was put together with some good slices of turkey breast, leaf lettuce, tomatoes and red onions with mayonnaise, spicy mustard, salt and pepper.

The experience from walking into the door, ordering our food and having it on our table was a very quick experience and we enjoyed a nice clean atmosphere to eat our lunch.

I was expecting the place to be much more busy, however since we arrived at 1pm for lunch it had all its booths filled up, but not very tables - which is where we sat.

Again, I can see why I came here a lot in the past. I am glad my wife suggested this place to try.  This one is definitely going on my work lunch rotation. :)"}
{"text":"Not a lot to say. They good fresh food that's a little high priced. Everyone is friendly. They could do a better job wiping off the tables, especially since they have us clearing the dishes and sorting them. While it was a busy lunch time food came fast."}
{"text":"Terribly disappointing. Panera used to be a favorite place of mine but after tonight I'm pretty sure I'll never come back. 

The first thing we tried to order...sorry, out of whole grain flatbread. Hmmm...
The second thing we ordered...soup in a bread bowl. After we sit down, sorry, we are out of bread bowls!!
The bowl of soup was almost ice cold and when I told one of the girls working, she let me know she could warm it up for me. Really?!?!? Can't even be bothered to get me a new bowl of soup?? Almost no salad dressing on our salad either. Just a horrible experience overall. 

Go somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews. This Panera location is new (Sahara & Rancho). It is very clean and organized. I have only been here a couple times, however I have been impressed by the Staff. They are super friendly and attentive. The environment in here is relaxed and has  good energy from what I have experienced. I forgot to add, the food is well presented and good! 

Panera On!! (Party on)"}
{"text":"Reviewing a chain restaurant? Darn right I am. And I'm not one to complain about big box restos, but there was just something about the lackluster service (and fruit flies) that really bothered me here. 

Food: same old stuff. Good, healthy-ish options and reliable for the most part.

Parking: Love the 1hr free parking option for that building! 

Service: Noooooooooope. I understand the need to hire high school and college students on spring break, but I would vet out some of the bad apples a little better if I were them. The gal who took are order was great. But then a bunch of stuff happened that irked me: 

1) We got our cups and went over to the fountain area. This tall, large male employee came out of the back and then basically stood over my boyfriend, his son and I while we filled our cups--WAY too close for comfort. Then he made our little one feel so rushed and uncomfortable that he didn't even want to get a drink. So he turned around to let the employee go--and the guy didn't even say anything. He just ran our little guy over to fill up his cup. Once he was done--he then stalked me while I was trying to find a lid and straw. If your manager isn't going to say it, I will. We are customers. Guests. You are an employee. I shouldn't see you hanging around the soda fountain rushing paying customers out of the way while you're on the clock. You wait until there isn't a line and then help yourself when the paying customers are done. This is a common sense thing. I don't invite guests over for dinner and then rush them to get my food first. Makes no sense. But you're also a man! You're rusing a child and a woman to help yourself? Your answer when our little one turned around to tell you to go ahead should have been, \"Oh--I'm sorry young man. Please go ahead. I can wait.\" But there was just a crappy look and no manners. I'm sure your 17 year old existence is full of lots of angst, but you might have better luck in life using borderline human-nature-manners and common sense. 

2) While this whole drink thing was going down, an entire table of managers and employees were sitting at a table right next to us witnessing this. No one said a thing. 

3) Also while this was all going down, a young female employee comes rushing out, interrupts the manager meeting and so the whole area can hear, loudly describes how she microwaved the icing for the pastries but can't figure out how to pour it on. She then tells everyone how she put her finger in it to test the temp and burned her finger. Ooook. That's gross. And why can you not pull a single manager aside to ask her to help you in the back? Did you need to broadcast your seedy behaviors? Note to self: I'm never ordering pastries with icing from this location--I'd rather not have random, unclean fingers temp testing my food. 

4) Fruit flies. 

Again, our food was good--no problem there, but the service needs some help. Big time."}
{"text":"Had often been to Panera in the us, and quite liked the place for a casual lunch. We decided to try this location (Don Mills Centre), in spite of not liking the Panera in Thornhill.

We were pleasantly surprised, and we found both the food and service excellent.

First a word about the service....they seem to really care!

The feature an array of freshly baked goods including pastries. I don't know if all the doughs are made on-site, but they seem to bake everything there.

They offer a wide array of soups, salads, and sandwiches. They also offer a combo consisting of a 1/2 soup and 1/2 a sandwich of you choice. I tried and liked the Onion Soup, and the turkey/asiago sandwich.

They feature a cold tea \"bar\", and their coffee is good.....

Overall a nice place to have a quick lunch and in the spring and summer to enjoy it al-fresco."}
{"text":"It is part of a very successful U.S. chain. This MUST be franchised. It is not on par with the other restaurants in the chain.

It is too expensive and a quick lunch for 2 will run you over $29.00. At that price there are a lot of options in that neck of the woods. I say this for this type of restaurant, with no table service.

Since it is called Panera Bread (is that redundant?..but I digress) I did not found the bread too tasty or for that matter good. The crust was 'plasticky' as opposite to crackling or crunchy, and it was on par with a day old baguette from the supermarket. They are also stingy, they only give you a slice of bread with the soup, although in their other restaurant you get a small fresh small quarter baguette loaf.

The soups are alright but to thick. Not everything is heartier when it is thickened, but these people seem to believe that. We met some friends for a quick lunch there and the verdict was not to return. It was not bad enough to warrant inclusion on a 'black-list' but they have a lot of work to do."}
{"text":"I absolutely love paradise bakery but will avoid this location like the plague. Do yourself a favor and drive the extra distance to superstition mall food court or the val vista location. The service here is terrible, the employees all act like they have better things to do and any type of special order is a burden. I always end up being disappointed with my experience at this location"}
{"text":"Very fast service with smiles, and the food was fantastic. Very clean drink and condiment area. Dining room very clean. Restrooms very well kept. Will return!"}
{"text":"This is quite honestly the worst Panera I have ever been to in my life. The customer service is beyond horrible, all they do is roll their eyes as if the customer is an idiot for not knowing about the menu. Honestly with how they treat customers, the employee must be dreadful to have to manage and even work with. I can't image going back here. Even in the drive through they are beyond rude. The only good experience I had was when Ashlee greeted me at the drive through window. Every other employee I came in contact with was beyond rude. Don't bother coming here. Better off taking your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Today is the first time I visit the Panera Bread restaurant. I ordered a 1/2 Italian Combo Sdw and get the pager at 2pm. I wait for at least 30 mins, and finally after the second time I ask where is my sandwich. One of employee notice they did not trigger my pager and give my order to another person. They made another sandwich, and thanks for that I am late for an appointment at 3. 
Beside this unpleasure order. This restaurant is very hot too. They turned the AC off and only few poor fan working."}
{"text":"Oh Panera, how I wanted to like thee.  Unfortunately even with good service, this isn't a place I will be visiting again.  First off, they were well overstaffed.  Seems maybe they were training others from other locations here.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  

What wouldn't bring me back:

1) Considering the number of staff on site, you might want to just take the order of customers eating in while they are seated.  Doesn't make any sense to have this many staff and still have customers make their orders out front.  It was difficult for me because I had a little guy and so, I had to find a seat first, leave my jacket, baby bag, grab a high chair myself then walk back to the front of the restaurant to make an order.  Didn't make any sense when there were 3-4 staff + 2 managers just standing behind the counter.  This is 3pm on a Friday.

2) Pricey:  I ordered a Cheese and tomato grilled ciabatta (1/2 sandwich) a chicken noodle soup and a Ham and Swiss full sandwich with 1-small chocolate milk came up to a whopping $23.

3) Food quality:  terrible.  C'mon guys, I work downtown Toronto and I can get better food in the food court!  For the price I paid; I got an overly salted chicken noodle soup, tasted like a canned Campbell's soup; barely any chicken/no veggies and and even noodle.   So really, it's more like chicken broth.  The sandwich:  3 slices of tomato with barely any cheese in a thick ciabbata bun.  Again...terrible.  Ham and swiss:  the bread was good (it better be with a name like Panera BREAD) but it was a typical ham and a slice of cheese, lettuce tomatoe.  There weren't any condiments nor did they even ask how I like my sandwich.  It was bland and boring.  Subway makes better sandwiches than this!  Went home with 90% of the ciabbata sandwich and half of the ham and swiss to give to the dog.  Frankly, I think he would've preferred something else.

I wouldn't be going back."}
{"text":"Walked in the door, I thought perhaps their vacuum was broken.  Worst I've ever seen it.  Got a cup of onion soup....it was apx 115 degrees, Health Dept. requires a temp of 145.  The manager Mark didn't seem concerned at all that the floor/carpeted area was in dire need of vacuuming.  I like Panera's but won't return to this one."}
{"text":"Large selection of breakfast & lunch items.  Looks like they don't use any artificial sweeteners or color just natural ingredients, I don't think it's organic or anything but none the less I'm happy to know they use fresh ingredients.  I enjoyed an all egg white with turkey sausage, cheddar cheese & spinach on a 7 grain fresh bread.  The hot tea selection was nicely stocked with fresh tea bags, they had peach & mint 
Mango, grey earl & hibiscus.   The staff was courteous and friendly, bathrooms were clean.  I'd totally go back"}
{"text":"Wonderful salads and super for calorie counting!! Always a nice place to get a good meal that is consistent.  Can't go wrong with the food or atmosphere."}
{"text":"When hungry reach for Pantera's. They'll make your tummy feel good about itself again. 

You know the feeling of soup, when it's made for you. Not commercially made for tons of people. That feeling is great, and that is why I'll spend a bit extra instead of a quick McDonald's fake meat burger. 

Customer service is spot on. I knew I wanted the soup, but what went with I couldn't think that far. The girl at the register was quick to peep with good sides that would compliment the soup without making me over indulge. I picked the turkey avocado. 

Nice cuts of meat, hearty portions to eat. The sauce was not for me, but you have to try it at least once. And the soup, we'll let's just say I felt like Mom was behind the counter cooking just for me. 

Highly recommend, great atmosphere, not loud. Andindoor, outdoor and patio seating. 

If you're in the neighborhood stop by."}
{"text":"I'm giving them three stars, because my favorite soup is back on the menu!  It is the Summer Corn Chowder and I hate it's only available a couple of months, because it's so good.  The staff seems friendly enough.  However, the place is always filthy.  I can never find a clean table.  The floors always need attention.  The chairs and booths are never cleaned out well.  I got the Pick 2, and the soup did not disappoint.  However, i got the Tomato/Mozzarella Panini, and it was not very good.  There wasn't a whole lot of Mozzarella in it.  It could use some basil or arugula.  I've been in a few Panera locations lately, and they seem to follow this same M.O.  Corporate really needs to address the cleanliness of their stores.  Also, it advertised Free Wi-FI, but yet I could not find an available Wi-Fi connection.  Glad the soup is back, and that made the visit decent, but it could have been SO much better.

I changed my star rating to 1 today, as I believe they gave me food poisoning.  I've been sick at my stomach all day, and that's the only thing I ate.  Needless to say, I won't be back to this location.  I should have known that if the dining room is filthy, odds are the kitchen/prep areas will be treated with the same care, or lack there of."}
{"text":"I was happy they opened another restaurant with healthy options close to my job.  They have totally redone the design of their stores.  I walked in and was helped right away.  The staff is very helpful and they actually have someone checking the \"To Go\" orders to make sure they are 100% correct.  They also have an expedited area to pick up call-in or website orders.  I was also surprised to see a Drive Thru.  I've never seen a Panera Bread with a drive thru.  My order was good, correct and hot, so I was very pleased with this location.  I hope they keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I used to like paradise bakery a lot but here is an example of an inferior company buying out a better one. Today I had the sausage over easy egg and cheese with a coffee. The sausage was very good and the egg was cooked great not over done. Cheese a little too sharp for me but was fine. light coffee blend was good but it was the last of the big pot so I told them. why didn't they know? I had to hunt down a fork as none was offered. A wierd restaurant. My 3rd visit and others were similar. Not bad and not great."}
{"text":"This place is horrible! Got an order there a few nights ago. Arrived home and found that Sesame Asian Chicken salad had no chicken. My daughters salad had chicken,but it was in a lump(like boiled chicken out of the pot). What in the hell is going on here? This place needs an overhaul!!!! Come on Panera Corporate,do something! Your restaurants are going downhill fast!"}
{"text":"We are big Panera fans and we go there often. The last few times service has fallen off. Tonight when we went, they left items out of the order, and the food was cold. We tried calling 4 times over a 30 minute period, but nobody answers their phones. We the  wasted 15 more minutes waiting for corporate to answer. The last time we tried calling and nobody answered, so we gave up."}
{"text":"never gets orders right or answers drive thru I've been sitting here ten minutes yelling hello no reply, awful don't bother, kids working there socializing not worth the price"}
{"text":"Panera bread is one of my favorite places to grab a quick sandwich or salad. My go to sandwich that I get every time is the bacon turkey bravo (on ciabatta bread). I have been to the McCandless Crossing location many of times; all of which have been great experiences until the last one. 

A month ago I used the drive thru (which I love) and didn't check my order until I sat down to grub when I got home. I ordered my usual bacon turkey bravo and was very disappointed because they left the signature sauce off. I'm not sure what the signature sauce is made of, but it takes the sandwich to the next level. It tasted like a very basic turkey sandwich without it. After looking at my receipt I noticed it said to notify them of any orders that are incorrect. So I sent out an email with my receipt information and explained the slip up but never received an email back. After looking at the low yelp ratings this location has received, they really should take their customer service a little more seriously."}
{"text":"Love Panera, but this location, without a doubt, always messes up our lunch order. I used to get the Asian Sesame Chicken Salad, but they started forgetting the cilantro. : ( I thought if I made a note of it or asked for extra that I would at least get the normal amount... no such luck.  If you aren't eating in, definitely make sure to check your order before leaving."}
{"text":"I am a former employee of this company, and my time spent there was a memory to be frank. However there is one fella I'd like to address. It's that manager Nick Carilli. I  was 16-17 when I started work here and in March, Nick decided that he would perform a wrestling maneuver on me. In the process, I was injured and couldn't race in my upcoming track meets. This didn't bother me because he said he was sorry, and I really didn't want to ruin his already pathetic life. However, new information has surfaced that concludes he hurt me with malicious intent. This was all because I was \"an asshole\". I don't care if I was an asshole or not, you don't hurt someone just because you feel like it. I have many of my friends who work there who will confirm this happening. I hope that his employer sees this, so he can realize what he's done."}
{"text":"Are you kidding, how can a Panera be out of all 3 side breads??! Someone isn't doing their job very well. First 1 star review I've ever given."}
{"text":"We eat here often, and always enjoy the menu. The use of the kiosks are great. The one in Surprise runs out of stuff regularly including baguette bread twice!! Never had an issue here."}
{"text":"Some of my co-workers rave about Panera Bread incessantly.  They eat here several times a week and swear Panera is the best thing since sliced bread.   I finally joined them for lunch yesterday and my unbiased opinion is... meh.   Nothing was terrible but I just don't see what the fuss is about.   First, the prices are higher than I would expect for soup, salad and sammies.   I had a flatbread chicken sandwich that was decent, but small for the price.  The salad was good, but my mind wasn't blown.   I guess for around $11 I expected more.  

For the price, I think Café Zupas offers better food and portions.  Your mileage may vary."}
{"text":"Ordered through drive through, was quick n easy. 
They seemed to be done with all the breakfast items by 9:40am itself! 
The staff was nice and courteous and offered other items close to the breakfast sandwich I wanted. 
Because of the construction opposite this location it seemed a lil difficult to get there but otherwise I'd definately love to go back again and again:)"}
{"text":"Love this Panera here in Chandler, AZ. The food is always fresh! The service is Great! The employees are friendly and very accommodating to customers on their birthdays. Will recommend this location to others as a very fresh restaurant and you get a free pastry on your birthday with the Panera member card. This location has a drive thru which is very convenient. Tyler and Simone are truly great assets for the Panera company to employ!! Great job guys, keep up the great service!!"}
{"text":"I called when they opened to place an order for delivery to my job around the corner from them. I am told that he will be doing the order online and will have to charge me over the phone for the order. I have plenty of cash but had forgotten my debit card at home and the dude told me that there was no way around it and I had to pay now. I told him thanks and hung up. Now I have to stave on my break because of this inconvenience."}
{"text":"Ordered the pick 2 and tried the new turkey cranberry flatbread and the tortellini Alfredo. The pasta is delicious.. Not a huge fan of the flatbread, however. Great tea selection!"}
{"text":"Just one of the worst Panera's around.  My husband and I do a lot of takeouts from this location.  Although the food is good and consistent, the service is terrible.  They have gotten our takeout order incorrectly 8 out of 10 times.  They either miss something or just completely not put it in the order.  I ordered their chicken soba bowl and guess what???  They did not put the broth in there.  I had to call the store and the person offered me a bowl on the next visit.  He proceeded to tell me they had none of that bowl when clearly I got it with no broth. WTH???  That was my dinner!  So my husband now had to go back there just to get that broth.  They need some good quality control in this store."}
{"text":"I am always in the mood for Panera!  Cloudy day?  Panera soup. Rainy day?  Panera Mac and cheese!  I usually head there for lunch, but I try to go after the lunch crowd ( around 2pm is a great time).  Even when they're are slow there is still a line so you have to be a little patient.  What I like to do is if I'm with another person I try to get a seat while the other stays in the line, and yes they are constantly that busy.

They're menu has grown a lot and the newer items on the menu are really good!  I love the \"You pick 2\" where you can get half a sandwich and half a soup, or really half anything on the menu.  The options are endless, but I always have my go to, the chicken frontega and the chicken noodle soup or french onion soup.  The sandwich is literally the best, and its on focaccia bread.  Amazzzzing!  Their mac and cheese is really good, but I think the pasta is a little too mushy for me ( I think because they probably make a big batch in the morning and just have it sit all day).

I love how they are changing their menu to where everything is going to be \"clean\" food, so no preservatives, or basically anything not good for us lol.  The staff here can honestly be hit or miss, sometimes you get someone that asks how your day was or smiles and sometimes you get someone that looks like they rather be somewhere else.  But this establishment is kept very clean and there is a good vibe there."}
{"text":"I used to love Panera! And honestly, every other location/experience has been so great...until this one.

1. The girl at the counter was extremely short and rude and we felt very rushed from the counter. That was a turnoff. 

2. My mom got a soufflé, which granted, she didn't realize we're sitting on a warmer in the bakery section, but when she asked to warm it they told her to do it herself and pointed to the microwave near the coffee. At that point, you might as well have just gone to the grocery and bought a frozen breakfast right?

I will say, in the end, the food was satisfactory. I wasn't overjoyed. I'll just say - I don't remember Panera being so \"fast food.\" It has certainly lost its quality with me."}
{"text":"Let me preface the forthcoming critique of this particular location by saying that I realize Panera Bread is not exactly a gastronomic Shangri-La.  Now that we've cleared the air of any haze of uncertainty and made it known that I have not set the bar particularly high, let me say that this particular Panera bread location is performing a great disservice in the way it manages its menu.
 
I hope that you won't judge me too harshly as  a pendant for mentioning that the grilled chicken Mediterranean flatbread sandwich, advertised as being served with tzatziki  sauce, was instead served with a pumpkin colored, paste-like curried  condiment.  

When this happened upon the first occasion of our visit to the establishment we took it as a fluke and a simple mistake. Three weeks later we have returned and the curried serpent has reared its foul tasting head having been slathered upon my wife's sandwich once again.

When she inquired as to why there was no tzatziki sauce on it this time the young lady replied that they were out of it and that the curry sauce was what was \"closest\" to it. 

This is truly unacceptable and flat out wrong. I realize that the fine staff at Panera might not have the culinary wherewithal to come up with something close to  tzatziki on short notice but curry paste is a far cry.  Why not just let the customer who is ordering the item know that they don't have the necessary ingredients to make it? It seems logical but I fear logic may not be present in the lexicon of those running the establishment. 

And finally, Panera has seen fit to remove the one menu item which I truly enjoyed, the chilled shrimp and avocado salad sandwich. Now my choices containing any sort of protein not mammal or fowl related are whittled down to no choice at all... just one item, the soba noodle shrimp salad. This could be a well-made salad with nice flavors but instead it takes several very fresh but unseasoned and completely flavorless shrimp and mixes them with soba noodles, sliced cabbage, and some spinach leaves and as the coup de grâce drowns the whole thing in a palate-numbingly tangy vinaigrette which renders all the remaining ingredients undetectable.

A little seasoning, some toasted sesame seeds, perhaps a  hint of citrus or some other semblance of flavor would go a long way in this otherwise abysmally bland concoction.  

In the end, after my wife was informed apologetically that the curry paste was substituted for the missing tzatziki sauce she asked if she could purchase a cookie. \"Sorry, but we're closed already\" replied the young lady.  

It seems, as Robert Frost said, that perhaps we should have chosen the road not taken and picked another restaurant for our evening repast creating a fond memory of a meal enjoyed. 

Panera need not worry about our return as I for one shall not be back."}
{"text":"Haven't been to p-nairs in a while.  Basically $20 for a whole sandwich and bowl of soup. Reasonable price is this was a full service restaurant with a chef, but since this is a corp franchise with high school kitchen assembly workers ..."}
{"text":"Place: nice and cozy

Food: mediocre 

Price: too pricey for the quality of food

Only food deal: 
Unlimitted coffee, tea and juice refil Tuesday Bagel Deal however you need to come really  really early or else there not much options left"}
{"text":"The Soup is always good at Panera.  

The sandwiches are inconsistent.  Their choice of type of bread is suspect.   It doesn't adequately hold the content of the sandwich.  Often crumbling apart.  

Today I asked for the bread to be toasted.  It arrived untoasted.  No big deal, I sent it back.  It arrives and there was no difference.  The bread was still soft.  So I sent it back.  It arrives again, and they said it was double toasted but the bread was still soft and there was no browning.   I asked them to quadruple toast it.  It finally arrived toasted properly.  

Seriously?  They are suppose to specialize in sandwich making.  

Two stars because the Soup was good and the Decaf coffee was not bad too.  And there was seating available."}
{"text":"Not the best experience today. The soup was very good but the sandwiches were poor.  I don't remember them being so tiny.  The chicken avocado was impossible to eat as a sandwich. The bread just crumbled apart.  Two strips of bacon.  That were cut in thirds and then in half lengthwise again.  Pretty cheap presentation for an $8.00 meal.  They forgot the sides on both meals too.  Seating is normally a problem.  Asking those with laptops and hogging seats to leave during lunch hours would help."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Panera Bread. That place is an amazing way to start the day.
Friendly, down to earth staff. Delicious food. Cozy atmosphere. Just amazing.
I love eating the Sierra Turkey sandwich with a side of a house salad. Their bakery also has a wide and delicious variety of goods to treat yourself with!"}
{"text":"We order at drive thru and food was fine but make sure you always check how it is packaged. I made the mistake of not and when i got home I was not satisfied. I ordered a bowl of their summer corn chowder.  Soup is always supposed to come with a roll and mine did not. I also ordered a brownie which they are always sold out of, so I was super stoked that they still had one when I got there. When I opened the box...it was put in upside down. All the chocolate topping was smooshed to the bottom of the box. Not to mention there was chocolate smeared ALL OVER the outside of the box. It was a MESS!  What kind of quality service is that?! Bring back Paradise Bakery!!"}
{"text":"The new menu is great. HOWEVER, there is nothing online or on paper to take home that shows what is gluten free. Also, they got out to go order wrong last time and we only ordered 3 meals."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch recently, and was reminded of how much I enjoy the place! The first time I went to a Panera was last year, on a date. The atmosphere was laid back, and there were so many people surrounding me that some of the tension of a first date was relieved -- not too intimate or romantic like some restaurants. 

This time lunch was during the work day, and at this location (Steele Creek) you will find many business professionals also on their lunch break. I suggest going before noon if you want to avoid the wait. The line can be kind of long and aggravating if you are hungry, but regardless, the staff moves quickly and you won't have to stand in line for longer than 15 minutes. 

I ordered the You Pick Two deal, where you can select a soup and salad, or soup and side. I chose the broccoli and cheddar soup, and a Caesar salad. WOW. That soup was so creamy and delicious that I have been thinking about it again days later. I could kind of go for it right now just talking about it. The Caesar dressing is to die for, and the leaves were fresh and tasty. 

The staff were friendly and efficient, and the facility is very clean and comfortable. 

I may have to go there today now. =)"}
{"text":"I loved this place!  Perfect for a healthy delicious lunch with a ton of options to pick from you can't get bored!  Personal favorites inclue the Mediterranean Veggie Sandwich, the sundried tomato bread is great, and the vegetable soup with pesto! Panera has great options for kids too."}
{"text":"My favorite things about Panera are their apple side option, their 99 cent pastries, and Mediterranean  Sandwich. The sundried  tomato bread is delectable. My least favorite things are the smoothies ( taste too syrupy), the autumn squash soup (too sweet I couldn't finish it) and the long lunch lines. 11:30am  is a good time to beat the lunch rush!"}
{"text":"It is chain rating time for me folks... So here is another one for ya...  

Panera has some goooooood pumpkin spice lattes, and brownies, and danishes, and coffee, and turkey cranberry sandwiches, and power breakfast sandwiches, and soup, and  and and and.......  

That is all."}
{"text":"I go here often as I love salads and soups.  But they often run out of key elements such as bread for the sandwich, or quinoa for a quinoa salad.  This happens so often I have lost track of the amount of times.  The staff is unapologetic about this.  

Today they were out of ice tea and quinoa. I feel like once they changed from paradise bakery they lost their shine."}
{"text":"The food is pretty standard and the parking immediately in front of this place stinks.  I've always had their salads and they are either a hit or miss."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the quality of my food, not to mention the meal itself taking a little more time than normal to be prepared. Time is of the essence and a meal done correctly is becoming harder and harder to find."}
{"text":"Not ordering from this location again.... I had an extremely important breakfast meeting with a large office that I'm trying to build trust and ultimately an account with. This meeting is at 7:30. I submitted an order yesterday for a 6:45am pickup. It's now 7:25 and I'm watching the staff hastily put my order together...... I have a 20-30 min drive ahead of me and I will definitely be late. This may seem small but it makes me look irresponsible and flaky. The business I'm in is all about punctuality and this could easily cost me an account and a gap in my goals and quota. Pharma reps, don't bother with this place!"}
{"text":"This time of year I am all about the Sweet treats, Panera is the place!  Mint Cookies make for a great holiday party treat to give or to receive!  If you are anything like me......and earned the title \"cookie monster\" as a kid......because I ate all the icing out of the Orieo cookies and put the cookie part  back in the package...thinking no one would notice......then get the Petite Cookies instead.   Not that you won't make up the difference by eating 20 of them, you will just think your eating less."}
{"text":"My go to spot for a healthy lunch or dinner, fast service, wifi is great for working on projects. A bit slow on cleaning tables, it gets real cluttered and seats can be hard to find during rush time. Food is great, many tasty salads."}
{"text":"Great location, ok food, poor quality at everything else. Crumbs all over the booths and floor, and tables always dirty. Orders are not delivered accurately, plus the food receipt states that a treat will be given if they make a mistake in the order- no treat given every time I correct them. Seasonal bread not quality controlled- bought a Christmas loaf last year and it was grossly under cooked with raw dough still stretchable. Soups are decent, salads not too fresh and presentable and sandwiches are dry if not a panini. Pastries alway good. It's a decent place to study or do homework in a convenient area of town- just don't have any expectations."}
{"text":"I seriously cannot say enough amazing things about this place and this location! Megan has always been my cashier and she's amazing! Even when I place an order for delivery the customer service is amazing! Food is always hot, delicious, & fresh! Amazing! Will continue coming back!"}
{"text":"Came to Panera, ordered my usual... half chicken Cesar salad, half broccoli and cheddar soup. So I finish my soup and about to start on my salad--as I put my fork into the salad I notice a little piece of hair. It's about the length of someone with super short short short hair (pixie cut) also it thick and dark black. I only noticed it because I almost ate it. Anyways I took it back to the counter and let them know what I found and BOTH food preparers roll their eyes at me. They look at each other like they were expecting that I found a LONG piece of hair, but no it definitely no where near long. Then I just stood there because I wasn't sure if they were just gonna prepare a new one right there or not the Asian guy rudely said \"we'll bring it to you..\" no apologies with another eye roll. I didn't intended to write a negative review because I assume they would be more professional about it, turns out they couldn't be."}

{"text":"Being a native of Chicago, I was excited when I found out they were opening a Panera right down the street from my apartment. This Panera was awful though! 

I went to order my usual, pick 2 of the Asiago Turkey sandwich and broccoli cheddar soup. I was told when ordering that they were out of the usual baguette they typically serve with the soup. Instead, they gave me a really hard roll. Strike one. 

The food arrives at the table and my girlfriend and I start chowing down. I go to take a bite of my soup and immediately feel something hard and sharp in my mouth. There was a large piece of glass from another soup bowl inside my broccoli cheddar soup! Strike two. 

We went up to the counter to alert them of the matter. We spoke with the manager and he was apologetic, but said there wasn't much he could do other than offer me another soup. No thanks. We return to our table to find it empty! Yep, an employee cleared our table and our food and drinks were gone. Strike three.

I won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Worst service ever No avacado added to sandwich even when I ordered for it and chicken is bulky n tasteless and soup is also not at all of the same taste and I asked for triple chocolate walnut cookie bt got something else instead of that."}

{"text":"Wait times for food have just gotten terrible. Once my go to lunch spot stinks for service.  Someone in management needs to get a clue!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Locations is nice. It's not really too packed with tons of people during lunch."}
{"text":"I'm not really a Panera fan but my wife is, So being the yes dear man that I am, I've been through this drive through more times than I can remember... plus if your a warm blooded NE Ohio human, you like Carbs, and they have plenty to go around at Panera. So I've had a couple warm buttery cinnamon bagels, which is the only thing I really \"want\" from Panera but I've also had lots of over priced half sandwiches that always seem to be lacking something.... food! And the cookies are too crunchy for my liking, but when you are in the mood for soup or a dozen bagels chances are you won't be disappointed! So see ya soon...  because ya know I'll be at Wally World in a few days and get that buzz in my pocket: \"Can u please stop at Panera on your way home...\" Yes Dear!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner because I wanted a sandwich and salad to-go.  The roasted turkey avocado BLT on sourdough sounded good.  How can you be out of sourdough bread? Okay, that's fine. Oh, hold the bacon and no mayo please.  Maybe I should have added a little mustard but the sandwich was tasty just the same. 

A salad is a salad but this one hit the spot with a delicious balsamic vinaigrette. 

I ordered to-go so can't really comment on the dining area.  This location is still fairly new and everything was neat and clean.  Lots of people chilling, eating their bread creations. Staff behind the counter appeared helpful and motivated.

I say \"appeared\" because what do we know?  But then appearances can mean all the difference to a customer and what appears to be, becomes reality.

I could have probably ordered the half sandwich because with the salad, I was full before I finished."}

{"text":"I heard they're suop is froZen? That skeeves me out for sure! I'm also just not happy with the pastries. Eh, the salad was ok but the chicken was bizarre!!! So chewy and long, it just can't be! Next, the atmosphere, it was ok. I guess. I really don't like to sit outside but they wouldn't let me sit inside with my small chihuahu? Anyway; I'm not comin back"}
{"text":"Despite the fact that it always riddled with undergrads, this is a pretty solid Panera. The food is good, the employees are pleasant, and my order has always been correct. You can expect to wait in line at all hours, but they move through the line pretty quickly. 

I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars because Panera is so overpriced, but I do find myself here more than is good for my wallet because of the soup and salad varieties."}
{"text":"Bad service unclean, poor customer service. Paid $10 to heat up my own roll, hot chocolate was cold, servers busy visiting while I waited for silverware.  
Asked for two forks. \"I was given 1 and told I was being demanding now.  \".    In case management is wondering what's going on with sales every afternoon or evening I've visited they're out of everything in display case.   Sad I really liked Panera Bread before. We're disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for several months and could always count on good food and good service. But lately it's gone downhill. I order from the app a lot, and they used to keep it up to date, but lately I'll order something and get there to pick it up, only to find out that it's not available. Or, the app says something is not available, and I walk in to find it sitting in the front case."}
{"text":"This place has become incredibly horrible: in a bowl of tortellini, about 10 pieces were completely dry and impossible to chew. The brownie has probably been sitting for three days, as it's completely dry and very hard.... I think the days for this place is numbered, if they don't get an overhaul soon! Never coming here again!"}
{"text":"It was out so before hitting the vegas strip. If you're kinda on a diet, this is the place to eat. I'd recommend the Kale Cesar salad and broccoli cheddar soup. Getting the half and half of these won't fill you up and the wait wasn't too long."}
{"text":"Monday night at 6:30p. Its 7:05p no food. When it arrives it's wrong. ugh"}
{"text":"Awesome food, very fresh. I wish they would fill up the bread bowl like they advertise it. I'm lucky if the soup fills 50% of the bread bowl. I always ask them to make sure the soup container is full but it's always missing quite a bit. Its aggravating to say the least. Docked two stars for this."}
{"text":"The southwest flatbread has a really bad sweet taste to it, otherwise it probably would have been alright. The chili soup wasn't hot. At least the apple was alright."}
{"text":"Small observation that didnt care for at all. Lets be clear this isnt my first time dining at this restaurant at all but there is alot I noticed at this location. Not sure if its the color my skin but if I didnt have the money I wouldnt have came in to sit down and have lunch. I took my nephew out for lunch at paradise bakery and noticed that not only was i not greeted which fine who cares but i sat down to eat here. As im waiting ordering she doesnt let me know to go to the other side until im standing there for some time. Then i ordered a pick two item with a salad and she tells me oh if you look here this is the cheapest salad like wayment pause bitch did i say anything about needing to stay on some budget or ask you whats the cheapest? NO so not sure why that was suggested then I clearly had to let her know the PRICE IS NEVER A CONCERN. I finish my order and pay before i could leave the counter my stuff was ready for me to take away. Meanwhile as im sitting here eating everyone else that places there orders while im hearing and seeing the same girl making suggestions, asking if they want a free membership and telling them what her favorite desert is etc. Then each person eating in was brought there orders of food to there table. Its really disrespectful to me in my opinion to act different toward others dispite the way you may feel. My average lunch here for a lil bite of bs is typically $30 clearly and if I was a cheapskate i could have went to in and out. I expected a level of respect that I typically receive in any other establishment that wasnt received. This will be my last time here thats forsure. I will spread the word as well smh so disheartening but some people aren't raised correctly."}
{"text":"We have picked up orders here several times, but will no longer. The order is often incorrect, but the most recent time we were missing half of the PB&J for my son. When I called, the manager lied to me and said that was all they normally do, but when I pointed out that we gotten an entire sandwich in the past, she prevaricated and asked me to bring the sandwich back in. What an absurd request! I tried to be patient but her only proffered remedy was for me to drive 20 minutes back to the store so she could \"assess the situation\".

Thankfully there is a better Panera down the street in Green Valley. Hopefully they build a new one a little closer!"}
{"text":"Fast service and a clean environment. My food and smoothie where okay but my bagel was horribly burnt. Sad to see this because all you literally have to do is put it in the toaster and get it when it's ready so it doesn't burn. No skill required at all! Smh"}
{"text":"Great selection with decent prices. Free wifi and a decent rewards card. Great lunch date place! A lot of children but that could be a pro or con!"}
{"text":"This place is fine if you're dining in, for when they get your food wrong. Leaving the tomato on when it says no tomato, fine. Not putting on extra sauce when it says extra sauce, fine I can make it. But this time was just the opposite of the order and this time I'm just not going back. 

 I get the Italian combo every time. No tomato, extra sauce. But this time I went for extra ham as well, three instructions must have been overload because I got no ham at all. Opening this when I got home, like twenty minutes away, it looked like just two pieces of bread held together with sauce with the spec of roast beef and small slice of turkey and salami that did make it on. 

Done with this location, go to another that can read a screen."}
{"text":"The biggest problem I have with this location is the lack of consistency.

Bakery items are nearly always delicious and just what I expected. But the cafe portion of this establishment leaves much to be desired.

A few weeks ago, I ordered a bowl of soup and it was really good. I went back last week, and for the same price, the portion size is much smaller, was more watery, and they didn't have part of my order in stock (this cheddar biscuit that comes with the soup, and really makes the whole dish). When I noticed it was missing and asked, the employees didn't care. 

A few times I've been here and there are long lines despite the fact that the restaurant is nearly empty. On other occasions every table top seems covered with crumbs, or there are dirty rags sitting on tables with no one attending to them.

I also loathe the fact that you can't get a glass of water (they now keep the water cups behind the counter and you have to ask for them).  I will find it hard to return here."}
{"text":"Decent, if overpriced for breakfast. Lunch/dinner is overpriced as inconsistent quality.

Coffee is average. Espresso drinks are pretty good, I'm not a coffee connoisseur but they get the job done. The bagels here are by no means traditional style, they are almost like a croissant/ bagel hybrid but I like them that way. My favorite thing is probably the mini soufflés, always consistently delicious.

As for lunch/dinner, your best bet is to only get a seasonal item once or twice. If you order the same thing each week, it will decrease in portion size and quality until eventually, the restaurant has to make substitutions and they take it off the menu. And the staff will by no means be apologetic or helpful about it.

Another fun trick is that of you order to go, your portion is smaller than if you eat in.  what? 

They do occasionally have some great salads or sandwiches, but it's always expensive for what you get. And it always feels like you're part of some corporate marketing scheme."}
{"text":"First time ever at a Panera.  They completely botched the order.  Gave me a half and half, when never did I mention a sandwich.  Gave us bread instead of grain roll (on receipt).  Didnt ring up a drink I ordered.  And the Asian sesame salad was missing ingredients.  And, when i brought the sandwich to them, they didnt offer the \"free treat for your trouble\".  Salad was dry and tasteless.  Charged us the adult price for kid salad.  This place is a dumpster fire in disguise.  The only accurate thing on the receipt was at the bottom where it reads \"HERE POS\""}
{"text":"Typically I love Panera however today I try to order online and systems were down so I go into the location and kiosk were also down I usual get s salad and have Tuna as my protein. I get my salad and they put 1,teaspoon of Tina on the salad. It was lunch and i didn't have time to wait but was so disappointed. What made it worse I reached out to them on Twitter and no response."}
{"text":"Ok, when a place screws up 4 times, it warrants a pretty crappy review lol. I've been here more than 4 times, but honestly the last two times they forgot to put part of my order in the to-go bag.

I was there today and asked twice if everything was in the bag. My fault for not checking myself, but it seriously doesn't take rocket science to read an order, make it, and put everything in the bag especially if there are 2 PEOPLE working on your order. 

When I called the place to let them know of their mistake, they tried to have me come back to pick it up. Ok, this is why I really feel that there are some pretty incompetent people working there. WHY WOULD I COME BACK IF I ORDERED TO-GO? Clearly there is a reason why I ordered take-out and there was no way to come back based on my time! When I explained this to the manager, he tried to instead just take my name down so that when I come back at a later time, I can get a free sandwich. Again, no, this has happened before and when I went back that time, there was no record of my name. So, after explaining that to the manager, I just told him I wanted to refund the missing order. He finally refunded it and we'll see if it shows up in the next couple of days.

My girlfriend also got sick from the sandwich she had. Funny thing is that she had said the ham on her sandwich smelled a bit funny. Sure enough, 3 hours later she was having severe abdominal cramping and vomited.

Pretty sure I will NEVER visit this Panera Bread location again."}
{"text":"Could not order sandwich online so drove there and went in. Ordered and waited and left and when I got to my desk, all the things I asked for were not on my sandwich. There was only cheese and a small serving of ham. No tomato, lettuce, onion or mayo! What's up with that???"}
{"text":"If I could give it less than a star,  I would.  How do bagel spots run out of bagels... at only 10am!?!?!? Then, why give a patron a buzzer if they are not going to use it to either a. Buzz you or b. Bring your food out to you as promised.  So we wait and we wait and we wait. My daughter finishes her bagel and we decide to go ask what's going on. Guess what!  It's been sitting there for who knows how long!  And lastly, my husband gets his bagel and it does not have the egg. Come on folks!  It's Panera! Get your stuff together! #notreturning"}
{"text":"I just couldn't bear to have another McMuffin or other type of fried egg sandwich. But I was hungry. I stopped in at a nearby Panera bread, and noticed all kinds of carbs surrounding a few small soufflés. I tried the four cheese soufflé at about the same calorie count as a McMuffin, what a great alternative!

The egg centre was almost custard-like, and the pastry surrounding it was light and fluffy. It was really a great breakfast snack! I'm sure I will try the others.

The coffee however is a bit on the weak side, but what the heck."}
{"text":"Let me say this.... I did not eat here. But I had to meet someone here around lunch time and the first thing I noticed before sitting down was how FILTHY the dining area was. The floor, not just around my table, but in general, was littered with food, paper, particles of who-knows-what. It looked like it hadn't been swept in several days. The table was sticky. The surrounding tables were all out of sync, with chairs jutted out of place. The restaurant was crowded, as you can expect any Panera to be at lunch time. I was planning to pick up something to-go after my meeting, but after seeing how poorly the area was kept I thought I'd better not."}
{"text":"I worked at a Panera when I was in undergrad, and the standards were much higher than this one. My food is always sloppily prepared, my orders are frequently wrong, and the wait times are excessive. I know it is a busy location, but the Panera I worked at was the busiest in its franchise and our wait times never got like that.

I used to love Panera, and I still enjoy other locations, but this one is seriously lacking."}
{"text":"One and done.

Got a tuna sandwich and it was bland. Bread was basically hardtack. The lemonade was pretty good. 

Service was, to be kind, a tire fire. Place was generally dirty. Layout makes no sense either. Basically you wait in line forever, get rude service, walk around the corner, wait forever, and hopefully recognize your order."}
{"text":"Leah the Supervisor on duty this afternoon was very friendly and went above and beyond to help me out with my order today."}
{"text":"Good food little busy to sit and stay long but love the French onion soup. First time at this location just happened to driving past"}
{"text":"Quick.  Friendly.  Clean.  Fuji Apple chicken salad and a brownie.  What else is there to say?  Great.  I love the outside tables."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would.... Called to place a to-go order and the lady was telling me about their gluten free products and about how their mobile website would be easier even after I told her that I was In a slight hurry to get to work.... I asked for a soufflé and she told me my favorite kind as well as the other 3 were available.. I arrived before I could even start placing my order and I had already been on the phone with her for 7 minutes. I walked inside to a full line with one person on the register. Not only that they only had 2 soufflés left.... Spent 10 minutes in line got my order taken and waited near the To-Go stand. They called my name and I picked up my order... Walked out to my car and they FORGOT the soufflé..... I was late to work at this point walking back inside and telling them they forgot part of my order. I was told there was a note on the bag yet I paid for the soufflé and there was no note located on the bag. I told them I paid and wanted one. They told me they only had two left in stock. I told the lady it did not matter which kind that I just wanted any kind. She walked me to the soufflés and moved extremely slow almost on purpose. She stared at me with the soufflé in hand asking if I was late for school or if I wanted utensils which was alright. But then she placed each utensil while staring at me separately in the bag. It was the slowest panera I have ever been to and they got my order wrong. I will never be coming back to this location and sadly I'll be telling my peers today at work... Please fix this"}
{"text":"Great place, this was the first time i ever tried Panera Bread and I'm a fan. The food is great for people who are trying to cut weight and for people trying the bulk up. The price is alittle high but the food is amazingly fresh and good."}
{"text":"This Panera is tops due to its efficiency! I'm a huge fan of places who know how to deal with heavy lunch crowds and this location fits that bill. Now that I work in the area, I find myself stopping by here at least once a week. Thankfully, every time I know that I'll be able to pop right in and out should my schedule call for it.

This location does fill up on the inside during lunch hours so be prepared to grab your lunch to-go but there is also a small outside area that is nice.

Friendly staff also help make this location a winner!"}
{"text":"Avoid the drive-thru if there is more than one person in line. The drive-thru is annoying, slow, and completely negates the point of its \"convenience.\" 

Go inside, the staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Went to Paradise and it was bad. No croutons, no bread, supervisor was argumentative, talking about customer  -bad attitude."}
{"text":"I always have mixed feelings after I leave Panera.  So here are my pros and cons:

Pros:  the food is generally very tasty and fresh.  I haven't eaten anything there that I didn't like.  The salads are good, sandwiches are good, and I love the chocolate chip cookies.

Cons:  The bill is always higher than I want to pay--especially if I bring my kids.  I don't want to spend $20 to $30 for lunch for myself and two children.  Also, sometimes it's hard to find a table and you walk around waiting for people to finish while some person sits in a booth with their laptop, not eating anything, and loiters for hours.

I will most likely go back to Panera, but not with children and not during the busy noon lunch hour."}
{"text":"Today there was a Christmas parade on 8th Street which created a lot of traffic so, we decided to stay at the Waterfront for lunch and chose Panera.  I had a You Pick 2, and the stand out was the Autumn Squash soup. It tasted great, and it was so hot that it thoroughly warmed me up!  Good stuff!!"}
{"text":"Took the person over 5 minutes to take our order and got it wrong multiple times. After being helped by 2 other employees she finally was able to take our order. It was a to go order and they forgot one of our salads. Overall the service is terrible and the food is not worth what you pay."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't understand what all the hype is about. Despite what others have said, the prices are outrageous for what you get. I guess when you are posting your calorie count, you're forced to provide smaller portions to make it 'appear' as though they are a healthy option. Keep an eye out though, some of those posted are for only half a serving!

I opted for the broccoli and cheddar soup with a half turkey and avocado BLT and although the flavour was spot on, the quantity didn't justify the price.

This was my first time at Panera so I will definitely give them another go. The service at this location was okay, nothing spectacular so I was left feeling just 'okay' about the place and a tad disappointed with my first experience at Panera. I really expected to be wowed based on what I had heard about them. Oh well, maybe next time."}
{"text":"Great Food as usual, but the exceptional service sent it 5 stars all the way.

I've been to plenty of Panera Breads and this one by far the friendliest and most courteous one. It was around lunchtime and the place was packed. An employee brought us our food and rather than drop it off and leave like normal, she asks if there's anything we need, and just let her know later if we need anything. WOW. Unexpected and appreciated.

The food was top notch like always. Frontega Chicken and French Onion Soup.

Kudos PB Kudos"}
{"text":"Screen ordering system is a long, arduous hassle that I just gave up on and left. Not worth the effort and time."}
{"text":"I have such a love/hate with this place. I've been coming to this location every week (sometimes several times) for over 2 years because I work within walking distance. The food is always consistently good and the staff is friendly. However, there have been several times that my order was incorrectly made/I was given the wrong order/something was missing from my order and there have been several times that they gave me a tiny amount of food/not hardly any salad dressing/they were stingy with like, everything. Probably in most cases, something was wrong. If you ask them to correct it, they will. Except for the time they gave another woman my order and when she returned it, they just handed it to me. I asked that they make me a new order because I didn't want to eat something another person had in their fat greasy fingers for any amount of time. The kitchen put up a fight with me but they eventually gave me a new order. The food here is not cheap and you really are paying for the quality, which is great when it's right and a fair amount. This is where Panera sadly and very often falls short. I will continue to come here for the things that I enjoy and I will continue to complain when things aren't right. I just really hope that this place gets their shit together."}
{"text":"Looking for lunch this afternoon, I decided to try a place I drive by all the time, The Paradise Bakery and Cafe. 

As I walked in I saw a large dining area and menus hung on the wall behind different stations. I surveyed the menu and wandered up to the front awaiting direction from one of the many employees standing behind the counter.

I was greeted with  \"Soup or Salad?\" Confused, I explained I would like to order a half sandwich with a cup of soup. The employee took my sandwich order and then handed me a receipt and directed me down the line for soup service. I carried the paper slip down to the soup section of the cafeteria like presentation line. There, another employee fulfilled my soup request and asked for the paper slip. Handing me my bowl of soup, drink cup and order placard, I was told the total and paid for my lunch. I ordered the Turkey Avocado BLT with a cup of Fire Roasted Tomato soup.

Walking away from the counter I discerned that the employees were neither rude nor friendly, just void of emotion. 

As, I filled my drink from the self service station and looked around for a seat I noticed every patron was staring at me like I was unwelcome on their sacred ground. I took a seat at a booth and awaited my sandwich.

Within a few minutes my sandwich was dropped on my table and my number placard taken without an exchange of words. Looking at my recently delivered plate, first thought was the presentation was insulting. It looked like someone tossed the ingredients on the plate and topped it with a piece of bread.

After reassembling the sandwich, I took a bite. Considering it's a bakery, the sour dough was bland and tough, same could be said of the turkey and the bacon was either microwaved or prepackaged. Moving on to the soup, it had more flavor but didn't wow me by any means. 

As I finished my meal and looked around I was encompassed by 2 types of patrons, the elderly and suburban hipsters flaunting their Mac Books and tablets and glaring at me. 

The highlight for me was the not so terrible chocolate chip cookie that came with my my sandwich. Perhaps the other baked goods are tasty but I'll never know. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Super disappointed with Panera Bread's chocolate chip cookies. Not only are they much smaller than the original Paradise Bakery cookies, but they have also changed the recipe since the acquisition and it is no bueno! Coming from Northern California,  my family and I used to look forward to getting a dozen of Paradise Bakery's chocolate chip cookies. Now that it's owned by Panera Bread, the recipe has obviously changed and no offense, but even Costco's chocolate chip cookies are way better. I guess we will start doubling our visits to Wildflower Bakery instead."}
{"text":"First off, I love this company but... there is something about this location that just does not sit well with me. There has been countless times I've thrown food away and wasted my money because of how it was made. I have a very bad dairy allergy so when I ask for no cheese it's kind of a serious matter. 
Tonight I picked up my food and low and behold cheese everywhere on everything. 
I really hope the cooks are briefed to read the order and just not make a dish. I will always not return to this location. 

The way it's ran is just not the same from other locations in charlotte."}
{"text":"They are fast friendly and efficient. The salads are fantastic. I love it there because you can trust that you food will be fresh and tasty. They also have the best bagels in town. I go to Panera around 4 to 5 days a week. You just know it's gonna be a great meal.!"}
{"text":"Screwed up my to go orders  TWICE and gave me lame excuses. If Ur going to charge $8.99 for a sandwich at least make it right. Getting HALF of what u paid for is not good for business. Then offering me LAME excuses as to WHY u messed orders up is weak and lame! I want Paradise Bakery back...."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Staff members were rude
and manager Ben did nothing when employees were rude inside of restaurant and then somehow found me on social media and then complained about me on Twitter."}
{"text":"The only redeeming factor of this place, is that they still carry the same food as Paradise Bakery. Paradise Bakery was once my favorite restaurant, they had awesome staff and they served good food. Panera is much different... Staff has become mundane and impersonal. The cookies are overpriced and missing my personal favorite peanut butter chocolate chip. When you order food its not brought to you even when you have a table marker specifically for that, so when your food is done they place it on the counter where it sits until you realize they just want to watch the world burn and you get up to get it yourself. My old paradise card was also not grandfathered in, so my reward couldn't be used here. Overall, I would recommend you go a little further west on McDowell to Estrella parkway while it's still a paradise bakery."}
{"text":"Oh how I miss Panera Bread! Thank you Colleen for your great Customer Service. You were awesome. Keep up the good work and hopefully I can make more trips to Panera. I will let my coworkers maybe one of our Company lunches can be Panera next time."}
{"text":"Today was a soup day for my sister and I. Victoria my cashier was great nice and friendly. I'm a talker so I felt right at home. Tyler or  who wrapped up everything for me was awesome. She even made sure I had enough bread for our soups. Broc&Cheddar the best soup and we love it!!!"}
{"text":"This place is no good, the staff seems friendly but their food sucks! I ordered half a  salad and a cup of soup. For \"soup\" they gave me just chicken broth and for a \"half salad\" they gave me half of a half. Everything was bland, basically I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"My chicken sandwich was good but overcooked, the bread's crust was extremely hard.  The cooks and other employees were talking loudly and not real helpful.  My friend had never been there and ordered a ham sandwich and wasn't asked if she wanted hot or cold?  disappointed with a cold sandwich!!"}
{"text":"I hope the cook just needs to learn to prepare the food properly! We had sandwiches that were only warm but the cheese was over cooked it was hard.  It is expensive for a quick stop lunch.......  the atmosphere is okay.  I have had better experiences at other Panera Breads!!!!  Not in any hurry to eat here again or recommend it again!!!!"}
{"text":"This is about the worst Panera I have ever been too. I ordered a salad , pasta for my kid and my husband got a sandwich. The salad missed about half of the add ons I wanted, the pasta was cold and seemed old. The restrooms dirty, the beverage area was not refilled. The trash cans so full you can't even throw trash in. This restaurant needs serious attention from management."}
{"text":"This place is new to boca park.  i love it because it is closer to my job (i think) than the one on lake mead and 95.  the downside is parking.  good luck.  panera is right next to total wine and rei. this parking lot is always full.  so get ready to do some searching, parking spots and few and far between.  other than that i am totally happy with this location. the staff is friendly and my food usually comes out pretty quickly.  i go on my lunch break so i have to try and get lucky with timing.  if not, it is busy (understandably so) and might take a while to get in and out.  that does not deter my desire to go here.  the food is delicious, i like the mypanera card they are doing now, and the seating is really nice. (i think the one on lake mead might be bigger, though)."}
{"text":"Their tomato soup is divine. And the staff are very nice. Customer service is excellent and the food is very good."}
{"text":"This Panera is a hit or miss for me. I come here a lot during the week before work and I can normally have a good experience here. This location is like all the others in that there can be some great customer service and other times it is just ok service. I realize that this is not a fancy restaurant but a lot of these restaurants are becoming a lot more enjoyable to go to. I really like that they have the self-service kiosks in the front corner right when you walk in. I usually go for this option if the line is really busy in the morning or at lunchtime. This alternative is fast if you know how to work the system. The first time I tried to use it I had to ask someone how to work it, but now it is pretty easy. The other great option is to order online before going to this location. I really like the Panera app and it is simple to just go into Panera and pick up my order. 

Once you order your food you can sit down and it will be brought to you. I really like this new system that they implemented, it is fast and usually pretty reliable. I really like getting the egg and cheese breakfast sandwiches on an asiago bagel. You can choose to have a over easy egg or a scrambled egg to go on your breakfast sandwich. I really like how they are adding different options and really catering to the customer. I also love the egg soufflés that they have in the early mornings. The pastries are great, and I love the 99 cent pastry deal when you get your lunch later in the day. 

I find that the customer service is lacking with some of the staff working here. When your food is brought to your table they are sometimes rude when you have something go wrong with your food. At a lot of the other locations I do not have this but for some reason this east side location is one that I have had trouble with. Overall I will still come back here as their breakfast sandwiches, bagels and pastries are wonderful."}
{"text":"My daughter ordered the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich with an orange juice that already comes bottled. The orange juice tasted acidic like it was bad so i told an employee and he didn't apologize and just asked \"what else do you want\"? Then my daughter stated her sausage in the sandwich tasted weird so i took a bite, was disgusted and told her not to eat it! That's the picture shown with old nasty \"sausage\"! My bagel sandwich was hard as a rock and it had been toasted, old bread too maybe!??? I went to buy my daughter a cookie because her breakfast was ruined, and i spoke to the manager John and he literally just said \"ok\" and didn't apologize once!!!!! He didn't even come out from behind the counter to talk to me! No John it's NOT ok! And i still walked out of there with an almost $3 mitten cookie on top of the $17 a had already spent on the tasteless food. Sometimes all you want to hear is an apology! Instead i literally felt like he didn't care and even the next customer in line noticed it! I would think if he cared that he'd pull me aside so other guests didn't hear my complaint. But nope, John doesn't care."}
{"text":"Too expensive for soup and sandwiches. I paid over $30 for two sandwiches (one was1/2), 2 bowls of soup,  3 deserts and 3 drinks. One sandwich was a kids grilled cheese.  Food was average at best. The pastries were only .99 each so I don't know how the bill was $31 Ridiculous! Soup was soooooo cool. Had to warm it in the microwave there. Did not get a spoon with my meal/soup. Had to ask. Grilled cheese was not edible. It was just two pieces of bread with a slice of cheese barely toasted. My son did not eat it. Kids meal did not come with a drink???  There was barely any soup in the bread bowl.  It was all bread. Very bad experience. Im embarrassed that I recently gave my mother in law a gift card to Panara for Mother's day. I hope her experience  is way better than mine. Shame on Panara!  Probably won't go back. Not impressed at all for that much money. SMH."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and probably the last! Pro-they have a drive thru. Cons-expensive for the amount of food they give you and the taste isn't worth it. Plus, the employees seem like they could care less. They should spend less on packaging for your order and lower their prices."}
{"text":"A FLY came out my food. A legit fly. Totally gagged when I realized. NOT COMMIN BACK"}
{"text":"I normally order Thai Wonton soup for a while and was always satisfied at other locations. This location gave me a tiny portion and was told by the supervisor that they do portion measurement and it's what it is supposed to be. Definitely NOT worth 9 bucks! (See picture). On top of half side cooked grilled cheese for my son. I was being questioned how impossible that is because they use panini cooker. I honestly couldn't answer this. I didn't get a refund for half sided grilled cheese but the soup. Yes, I had to drive 5 miles round trip to get a refund. Poor management and food. Am disappointed! Gave one star only because I got half of the refund on my order."}
{"text":"Went during lunch time and it was busy, but the cashier was pleasant and took my order quickly and accurately. The wait for food was a little bit longer than I expected (~13 minutes) and I could've gone next door and gotten some Thai Iced Tea had I not have the buzzer given to me. Once I received my order I briefly checked to make sure that my order was correctly filled and then left to meet a friend elsewhere since all the tables and seats were full. What I was not expecting, was a charred Chicken Frontega Panini -- despite the busyness of a weekday I cannot believe they had the audacity to serve such inedible food. though I had a to-go order and the priority is to provide fast service, I would've rather waited an extra 5 minutes for an edible Frontega chicken panini - as long as I was told (otherwise I'd be in the dark about the extra long wait for a measly Frontega chicken). By all means, the other half of the panini was great, but would've been better had I got to enjoy the entire sandwich that I paid $8 for."}
{"text":"I love Panera Bread, especially this location. My food is always out quickly and the temperature is spot on. I have visited this Panera when out of town guests, friends or family are in town. I've even met here to sign papers. This location is friendly and inviting. I've even seen multiple people use the space to have meetings and interviews."}
{"text":"Rude employees. The little blonde cashier was very short with me for whatever reason and dropped my change on the counter then quickly walked off mumbling have a nice day. Definitely not the southern hospitality that I'm used to (nor do I expect it being in another state) but a little common courtesy never hurts. Disappointed in this location.

Edit- my turkey kale sandwiches were cold and cheese not melted. Awesome."}
{"text":"1st and last time here. Have no idea what everyone raves about Panera. Took my mom who is in a wheelchair and the restaurant is so cramped that it was difficult to get thru the tables. 
Ordered chicken noodle soup and BLT and the soup tasted like out of a can. The broth was extremely watery. 
I ordered the Asian chicken salad and it was such a small size for the price and the dressing was funky tasting. 
Pricey for their portion sizes and the quality. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Soo unimpressed! Tried to be healthy after the gym today so thought I'd hit up Panera for the first time. 

I ordered the pick 2 which included 1/2 a Frontega chicken panini and a cup of the broccoli cheddar soup and baguette for $12

The chicken in the panini was absolutely disgusting! Very very dry and rubbery. Completely uneatable that I had to take all the chicken out and just ate the bread. 

The soup on the other hand was much better. Very thick and flavourful, although the baguette that came with it was a little too hard. 

After having a bad experience I contacted Panera using the online chat and they said the franchise team would contact me. Not sure where the issue will go from there, but overall, after having such a bad experience I definitely WOULD NOT RETURN."}
{"text":"I ordered breakfast sandwiches online the night before for our monthly staff meeting. The online service was very easy to use, quick, and efficient. I get a little nervous about online orders so i tend to call and make sure it was received. The only issue was the 3x i did call it would go straight to voicemail, and it made me a little nervous. However I'm glad i stuck with them, because my order was ready and beautifully packed right on time. The manger was friendly and the cashier was as well. The restaurant was clean on the outside and inside. 

The food I ordered was 25 different breakfast sandwiches and they were all labeled which made it super easy for all of us to pick from! The one i ate was the avocado/spinach/egg white sandwich and it was delicious!! I did ask all my teammates and they were all super pleased and requested we do this breakfast again next month."}
{"text":"Once again, it's Panera.  This location is usually jam-packed and parking can be a hassle (although you can park in the Target lot).  Service is pretty fast for take out; however, due to how slammed this location is at seemingly any given time of day, I usually visit the Indian Trail location if I want to sit at a table for a while."}
{"text":"It's Panera.  The food is good, as is typical; however, this location gets super busy around lunch time.  Service is quick, so it's fine if you're taking your lunch to go, but you might have to fight the smartphone-wielding and laptop-bag-slinging crowds for a seat if you want to dine in."}
{"text":"Panera is Panera, and the folks who work here are nice, but weekday parking is AWFUL at this location.  I actually drove away without getting anything this morning because there was no where to park that wouldn't get me towed.  The workers at the office building on the other side of the lot really need to be required to use the parking deck."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to find out a Panera was opening in the East Valley. Every time I'm in California we seek out a Panera for that salad and sandwich fix with awesome iced tea. Paradise is ok but no amount of rebranding or bringing Panera items to the menu really did it for me.
This location...was a bit disappointing. They could have done so much better. The most glaring difference between this Panera and others I've visited, the staff is completely missing the signature customer service and efficiency. The first visit, the cashier didn't know the menu, the tables don't have the location pagers so we had to flag down our food. The employee cleaning the soda machine was chatting with friends and people behind the counter and we had to interrupt just to ask if we could get to the ice. Another visit when we used the drive through, every part of the order was wrong. I know food allergies are a pain to deal with but it's just a bummer to get all the way home and find out I couldn't eat most of my food. Especially when I double checked that the items I ordered didn't have cheese.
I'll probably come back if I'm in the area because the food really is good. But I'm not making the drive just for a Panera fix anytime soon."}
{"text":"Paneras is typically a decent place to get a bagel and salad.  The food is usually alright, yet overpriced for what you get.  I can normally overlook that if the customer service makes up for it.  Sadly, that is not the case with this particular location.  The customer \"service\" at this location is typically poor, but today's visit was horrendous!  It was as if I was doing them a favor by letting them take my money!  My gift card was not appropriately applied and when I got the attention of a manager to try and remedy it, he did not fill me with confidence that it was fixed.  It was as if somehow I was at fault for their computers not working, and what an inconvenience I was to deal with.  Clearly, they must be making tons of money that they can afford to be so rude and disrespectful to their customers.  Go anywhere else but here...there's plenty of other places to be treated badly,  for less."}
{"text":"Love Panera. Sign up for their rewards card (free) and you will not be upset. Everyone is very nice at this location. Pro tip though: go early during the dinner rush if you are craving soup. They run out quickly."}
{"text":"I frequent this Panera quite often because I work across the street. I love Panera and have been to various across town, but never have received as low quality food as I have at this one. Every time I have ordered to-go, something has been off about about the food. Whether the meat tastes old, there is barely ANY meat on my sandwich, or the cheese was not melted on my sandwich and the bread was tough and not fresh, seemingly. Now that my Panera gift card is used up, I will not be returning to this Panera. Don't waste your money on mediocre food."}
{"text":"This may be the worst experience I've had at Panera Bread. My grilled cheese sandwich was burnt to a crisp. The girl at the front counter was nice but I would not come back. Food was not good. My advice don't get the hot food."}
{"text":"Absolutely no sense of urgency. Food is good. Service is disappointing. Waiting for 10 minutes for a small mac & cheese to go, AFTER  the cashier forgot to add it to my original order."}
{"text":"Jessalyn and Mia gave me exceptional service! They provided me with a few vegan options.. their personality was so refreshing and amiable! Thank you ladies !!!"}
{"text":"I try to like Panera, I really do... easy, convenient, can customize items to make them somewhat healthy, but I continue to have not so pleasant experiences at many of the locations near me.  

I went to this location for a quick lunch while I was out in the field for work and ordered the Chicken Cobb salad with balsamic... it was definitely not the balsamic... I was given the dressing it normally comes with.  I get this enough that I know what the difference is.  When asked, they insisted it was Balsamic... actually kind of argued with me on it. I ended up eating a few bites, tossing it and then ordering a few pastries to go for customers. 

I was bothered at the fact that I spent another $11 or so on lunch and a drink only not to have eaten so I called to let the manager know... I was given attitude by someone who I do not think was the manager.  I give up. 

If you care about getting what you order, and decent service, do not come here :("}
{"text":"I am forced to use Panera for catering much to my own dismay at times... as I am more impressed with places like Roma pizza (amazing service, and they can work with any budget even when you are feeding 125+), Chick Fil A, or even Jimmy Johns.  

I continually ask that the spreads do not get put directly on the sandwiches (please put them on the side) as I know they make the sandwiches earlier than the pick up time when things are less busy.  I understand that they do this so that is why I ask... every single time I end up with mushy sandwiches courtesy of this not happening.  Very few locations get this right, if ever."}
{"text":"Great locale, good service.  My only issue is the table tops...too dirty.  I stopped in during the lunch hour and had difficulty finding a clean table without crumbs.  The food was well prepared.  I tried their new Southwest chicken salad.  I enjoyed it...great taste!  The cleanliness needs improvement.  Also, they need to stock more chocolate chip muffies.  Usually, at the end of the day is when most Paneras tend run out of these great bakery treats.  This location ran out before noon."}
{"text":"My favorite Madison WI Panera!  This place is awesome!!  Cozy and clean.  Organized and delicious food preparation.  The salads and soups are my favorite.  There are always plenty of pastries available for $.99."}
{"text":"Always too slow. Food is decent but nothing spectacular but I know what to expect here."}
{"text":"Asian Sesame Chicken Salad is my favorite 'healthy' lunch."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan. My favorite dish is the mac and cheese. I actually have a hard time ordering anything else. It is even better with the bread. But on occasion I'll order the pick two and get the Apple salad or the new wheat berry salad. Both are pretty good. 
I'm not a fan of their pastries. I'm not sure what the issue, but they usually taste bland to me.

Free wifi is a plus. They also have a few tables with outlets for charging (laptops or phones) and a pretty good iced tea."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I went in here for a quick takeout meal and our service was excellent. Lily was behind the counter, and went above and beyond to help us. We were asking a lot of questions about the menu and she was very helpful. She was able to explain many of the menu items in great detail. Her super friendly attitude and approachability was super refreshing. She was such a delight. I honestly will return more often knowing that this location has such great service. The boyfriend usually tolerates service staff and lets me take the lead, but while we were waiting for our food, he was raving about how nice lily was to us. 

I ordered the white cheddar mac and cheese and it was delicious, one of my favorites. Make sure you get the bread with the mac and cheese because it goes so well together. I also got the grilled cheese sandwich with Fontina and Gouda. It was really good. The boyfriend ordered a super large sandwich, The Italian. He really liked it. It was really big and had a lot of stuff on it. Steak, Turkey, Ham and Salami for meat, as well as Swiss Cheese, Peperoncini, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions and some kind of special sauce. Definitely recommend for those that are super hungry."}
{"text":"I assume all of the PB&C all mostly the same but the few times I have been here it has always been nice. 

The staff is friendly and helpful, the store is clean. 

I had an Asaigo bagel with egg and bacon. Apple wood smoked bacon as they tout. The bagel was kick ass, smushed with a panni grill. The egg and cheese were good. The bacon was small rubber strips of ?bacon?...

The prices are a little high but this is supposed to be more high end then Mcdonalds right?"}
{"text":"Be prepared to eat your soup with your fist like a savage because they never give me a spoon for my to go soup! Oh, and the bread is almost never fresh. Funny for a place that has the word \"bread\" in the name"}
{"text":"If you want twine (yes, the stuff that you jam into easter baskets) in your salad (which is yellow and gross to begin with) along side frozen chicken, go ahead to this location! Nothing like a twine salad and horrible customer service to jazz up my Monday lunch. Jerks."}
{"text":"I love Panara- we eat there too much. But this review is based on the staff not the food. It is Christmas Eve and they close in 10 min. I am that guy who forgot that we have no food at the house and need to grab dinner. We called they said they were open and so we went quickly. The staff is amazing. I know they want to go home and we were not the only ones who waited to the last second to grab dinner. Again thank you so much for being open and ready and accommodating. Love you guys. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Panera is known for having some of the best salads. So I thought to give a try. And frankly they stay true to it. I came in late, not knowing what to order, so I started asking questions such as what's the most popular item on the menu, the most ordered drink and so on. 

I finally ended up with the apple crisp salad and a glass of sparkling water. The salad was on my table after 10 minutes which seemed pretty reasonable given the fact that most tables were taken and it was during the busy time of the day. 

Nevertheless, the quality of the salad was outstanding. Just as I was expecting it. All the flavors were there and freshly made. Now put some ranch on everything and it's something out of ordinary! 

Overall, I'm very satisfied with the service and will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Service sucks. Employees barely pay attention to you. I'm an employee who works at the mall and this location turned me away from \"paradise bakery\" or \"panera\" or whatever they want to call themselves now. I know working food service sucks but at least be nice to the mall employees who have to be there too."}
{"text":"My wife is from PA and they have Panera in every corner. The food has always been great there and here in AZ.

We are happy to have things that remind us of home, but the staff needs to focus a bit more on getting the orders the right way. We order two tuna sandwiches, a chicken noodle soup, a lemonade and a latte. 

For one of the sandwiches we added cheese and asked for no onions. For the other one we didn't want tomatoes. We got our order and both sandwiches were wrong. The one with no tomatoes had tomatoes and cheese. The second sandwich had onions. We asked them to fix the order and finally at the third attempt we thought everything was right. As I bite my sandwich, the first thing I could taste were the onions! At that point I just decided to put the onions aside on my own. Too hungry to wait anymore! My wife's sandwich was fine, but as she takes a sip of her latte, she realized that they gave her hot chocolate instead of coffee... 

We love the food here, but next time we go back we hope to get our order right. I'll definitely make sure too check my sandwich before biting it!"}
{"text":"The avocado on my turkey avocado BLT consisted of two pieces, both completely raw, inedible with parts of the seed still attached :(  on top of that there was no dressing in my Greek salad.  It really sucks to spend 15 dollars to get something like that!! I could have gotten an Applebee's dinner for that price."}
{"text":"I am very upset and disgusted. I ordered a broccoli cheddar soup to go in a bread bowl -- I got home and was eating my soup when I started chewing something weird.. so I took it out of my mouth and it was a huge piece of plastic. It must have been from their packaging. Never returning to this location."}
{"text":"I love Panera, always lots of good options ,options that can be healthy, if you want it to be! My favorite is the breakfast soufflés!"}
{"text":"Food is good however got a bowl when I ordered a large bread bowl, then they got me a small bread bowl and I didn't get a receipt that I clicked to print out with my meal on the tablet. Bad food running and accuracy is my issue."}
{"text":"This Panera Bread is THE best!! The assistant manager was awesome! He was kind and had amazing customer service. Never a bad time at Panera Bread!"}
{"text":"I work in the nearby area and usually stop in for lunch once a month or so. I have never had any issues in the past and the food has always been delicious. However, this time was a bit different. The food I had tasted OK, but I ended up with food poisoning for the next 48 hours. Needless to say, I will not be returning to Panera anytime soon. I sure hope they are receiving fresh food and preparing it in a clean kitchen. Be careful!"}
{"text":"I love eating here. My boyfriend used to work at this location and first introduced me to the food here and honestly, I LOVE IT! I would eat here everyday if I could afford it lol. ALWAYS satisfied. And nice customer service(:"}
{"text":"Worst service I've had in a long time. I usually love Panera but this time the food was bland and the servings were smaller than usual. I waited for 15 minutes for someone to make my drink when there were 3 people behind the counter doing absolutely nothing. Next time, go to a different Panera."}
{"text":"I am a customer of the Panera in Surprise and have been since they opened.  The food is always good and the environment is as well.
Tonight other than a good meal I had to see the 'order taker' yawning throughout our exchange.  She repeated the order endless times which gets me to believe she was not listening.  In any case not a good sign before having dinner."}
{"text":"I visited the new location for lunch.  Big mistake. There were no seats for me to enjoy my lunch.  I sat outside for about 5 minutes, and decided to take my meal to go.  Very overpriced meal as well. A Cobb salad and chicken noodle soup was $11.  The server forgot my roll as well.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"It's one of the most popular chains in the United States so I think it's fair to say we have all been to a Panera. This one is very unique a definite standout. 

They are very slow, the staff does not seemed trained. I ordered a bagel toasted with butter. There was no one else in line yet I was asked to repeat my order 4 times. The cashier had to re enter my order twice and than asked what kind of smoothie I was having again? 

I don't have very high standards for service at Panera but wow they were really off their game. It took about 5-7 minutes for them to toast a bagel, they than put it in a to go bag even though I was dining in. 

My girlfriend ordered a turkey sandwich plain with just lettuce and turkey. They served her a sandwich with just lettuce. Literally the sandwich was two pieces of bread and lettuce. They did correct the issue but what is going on here, cooperate should really invest in taking the time to train their employees."}
{"text":"Had several great lunches here over the past few weeks.  The pick two combo is awesome (so far my wife and I have tried a ham sandwich, grilled cheese, turkey sandwich, the french onion soup and the ... potato soup I think).  All awesome.  Love that it comes with a slice of their amazing bread too.  We've also tried a sampling of their baked goods, all of which have been really tasty.  Service is fast, friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"We stopped in here a couple times while we were in town to get some work done, grab a snack, and have a coffee or smoothie. Both the mango and berry low fat smoothies were fantastic and the coffee was good as well. Great scones too (we liked the blue berry and the orange best). The place has free wifi and tons of seating, so I can see why it was packed with students. The facilities could have been a bit cleaner (both the tables and restrooms needed a good clean) so I will take off one star for that, but I get that its tough with so many students in and out."}
{"text":"I think the flow is weird- hard to know where to get in line & where to wait. Even the staff seems confused. Can't tell you how many times I have gone for a bagel and when it is ready, they give me more than I ordered because they don't pay attention. I bring their error to their attention and am always fair. When I order a hot tea, I always have to ask for the cup!

Anyway, always love their food! The turkey bravo sandwich is so freaking good! I also love their Everything bagel & all of the souffles. What I don't love: dirty tables & lack of outlets. Even with their latest expansion, they didn't add more outlets."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Panera's food and have been for years. The baked potato soup is good on a cold day, and the sandwiches help heal you on Sunday afternoons when you're feeling the pain of a late Saturday night. The soup, sandwiches and salads are all good-quality and relatively cheap. Not to mention the delicious baked goods they sell.

I'm not as much of a fan of this location however. Parking is a pain there. It's a popular place, and there is often a long wait to order. Plus, the Myers Park crowd is pretty snobby. Warning: Don't go on a Sunday morning or early afternoon. The place is packed with Myers Park socialites who just got out of church and you'll struggle to get a table in the large restaurant. 

On the bright side, they've got free wireless."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Where do I start? This establishment was in horrible condition when I brought my family in. Almost every table was dirty ( including the one we are on) trash was all over the floor, emptied bottles etc. Then I looked behind their line.... Every trash can was full and over flowing, trash and debris on work stations, no sanitation buckets, food debris on floor.... Bathroom was dirty with trash over flowing.. they had a group of employees in the back area that smelled of pot.. then when I brought it up to a manager she said she was trying? I'm sorry I run a dietary department for a hospital and never have I seen anything more disgusting, the manager did get staff cleaning but I could tell that she told them that I complained cause they kept looking over at us like we were the bad people!! This was a horrible experience, I hope the owner sees this. Please reach out to me if you need help getting this place back up to par. Until then my family will not be eating here."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location in 10 months (when it was Paradise Bakery) but now that it is a Panera and I went in to give it another shot.  I thought MAYBE with Panera taking over there would be new management in place and things may improve but I was wrong.  I gave it a try today, went in at 11:35 (before the lunch rush), ordered a salad and soup and AGAIN it was slow, slow, slow it took 25 minutes for me to get my food and get out of there!  It's unbelievable how many people are standing around when there are long lines of people waiting (at least 20 in line).  What made it worse is that the ONE person who was running the register was also the same person who was serving up soup which was incredibly frustrating and SLOW.  What is the problem?  Why can't they get it together here?  I love the food but the whole experience of ordering and getting it is horrible.  So disappointing."}
{"text":"Panera Bread's Cream of Chicken & Wild Rice soup is very good. They make it only a few times a week Tues, Thurs, & Sat. The food quality has gone down over the years. The pick 2 is good combo if you don't know what you want. My usual is the tuna san. & chicken noodle soup. The salads are a hit or miss. The pastries and breads are good. And the toffee cookie always satisfies when they have them.

We don't usually eat in Panera but they run a clean restaurant, play mellow jazz music, they have free wifi, and the bathrooms are also clean. 

Panera's can get very busy for lunch & on the weekends. The restaurant will seat a lot of people and they also have outside tables too."}
{"text":"Ok. We are done.  Again our to go order is screwed up.    No dressing with an Apple Fuji Salad and it's full of kale instead of spring mix.    Won't be back ever."}
{"text":"Back when I worked in Gastonia, I ate at this Panera so often that I had the number programmed into my cell phone. Why did I need Panera's number, you ask... Because the wait there was always so long that I had discovered it paid to call ahead. They didn't really have a good system set up for picking up call-in orders, so I'd usually get the attention of one of the sandwich-makers and they'd go find my order. It was frustrating, but far less frustrating then the line that often went out the door. Still, the employees there were very friendly and the food was consistently good. I'm a big fan of the sierra turkey sandwich and the baked potato soup."}
{"text":"I LOVE Panera Bread!!!!! Great location, always clean, fast-ish and friendly service. Lovely menu-I'd recommend the egg/bacon/cheese on a bagel, if you can manage to get in before 11am for breakfast! Otherwise, everything else is spot on, I enjoy it all (delicious salads too, if that's your thing!). Great perks if you have the My Panera Card, monthly promos such a free coffee and such. It is expensive for what you get, so as long as you are prepared to spend a bit more than Tim Horton's, you are good to go!"}
{"text":"I finally tried Paradise last thursday with a co-worker.  I was expecting, well, paradise, but sadly was disappointed.  I wanted to go somewhere for soup A) because I've heard so many good things about the Fire Roasted Tomato Soup, and B) I had to eat soup because my mouth felt like someone hit it with a brick.

First off, I have to disclose that I dont care for cafeteria style dining.  I like to relax and order, so I wasn't thrilled about the set up.  But I didnt let that bother me too much, I just prefer sit down dining.

Anyhoo I ordered a bowl of the tomato soup, and the bread that goes with it and iced tea.... we then trotted off to find a table outside as it was pretty crowded in there.  

The soup was just okay... I was expecting greatness and instead I got luke warm, chunky soup that reminded me of bottled pasta sauce.  The bread was rather hard so I had to soak it in my soup to be able to eat it... and I know its not their fault that I was having brace-face problems but I wish the bread was a little fresher or maybe even warm?

So maybe I'll try it again sometime, but not as long as I can make a big pot of \"way better\" tomato soup at home probably for less money.

Oh, and I do like their cookies... I will go back for those :o)"}
{"text":"I like this place in Florida but here the staff have attitude and I feel sick after eating the food. I would not come here if f it weren't for the kids menu.  And one of the servers here who is delightful"}
{"text":"My wife and I've been here several times since it's been open. We've never had a bad experience. What Carly wrote her book about I'm not sure other than she went into too much detail. Food has always been on par with other Paneras. They have what I think is a new thing, they give you a buzzer to place on your table and then they will bring your food to you instead of you standing around waiting for it. It's nice, but when they're busy, the servers sometimes have a difficult time finding the table that the food goes to. All in all though I would go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here more often than the one in Stow. This one I feel is cleaner and more open. We've never had a bad meal, at least so far we haven't. Staff is always friendly and willing to help. Comparing this one and the one in Stow, I'll come here over Stow if I can."}
{"text":"Love many of Panera's soups including the French onion, potato, and broccoli cheese. 

The steak with arugula sandwich is very tasty yet sometimes it comes a bit red for my liking (you can have them cook the steak if you prefer no red).

One of my favorite features is being able to order online then easily run in and pick up my order avoiding the long lunch time lines."}
{"text":"This is the most filthy location I have ever been too...I was shocked when I went here for lunch the other day and the floors along with most of the tables had food, garbage, left over food just sitting there on the tables...crumbs and garbage everywhere. ...I tried to be as discreet as possible video taping because you won't believe how dirty it was...the employees overlooked everything...unbelievable...I guess they don't believe in team work because God forbid, cleaning is not in their job description...the manager overlooked it too...I didn't eat my $30 meal because I was afraid to think about who prepared my food...I am certain that place will not pass inspection if food inspectors walked in.....it is digusting."}
{"text":"I have always loved Paneras food and their pastries. I have been to many locations, and this was my first time at this location. And I must say their bakery/pastry items were extremely dry! I have never had this problem... Made me dislike my all time favorite bakery item and I did not think it was possible. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a quick breakfast here and it's much better than places like Einstein's for a comparable price.  I had a coffee and a cinnamon bun and both were good.  Would come back!"}
{"text":"My black bean soup had a small stone in it. Fortunately I caught it before destroying a tooth.  My wife's sandwich had a whole sheet of deli paper inside the turkey, layered right into that sandwich.  For Pete's sake...  We got a full refund, but this team is disturbingly sloppy.  Nothing wrong with the taste though, if you get something that's actually done right."}
{"text":"Large Panera Bread with tables and booths. While the architecture gives you a homey feeling, it's easy to get lost in here!

I have no complaints about the food - though my bagel was barely toasted - but for a ton of employees, there were quite a few messy tables and unorganized areas. Lemons were missing from the drink bar section, and for some reason the place served soup but without crackers? 

Good place to walk in and pick up pastries and a drink, but dining-in may be worth reconsideration."}
{"text":"Excellent stop on our drive through town. We have our dog aka four legged baby with us and it was perfect with a covered outdoor area and plenty of nearby parking!  Excellent quality food and friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"My first review was harsh, but they really got it together.  I also enjoy seeing some of the regulars each week.  Finally, the staff is really friendly and always helpful!"}
{"text":"Good staff with lots of energy.  Yummy soup, great pastry and good Sammie's .  Very consistent chain.  Best bet in this area for sure."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and tried several bagels including whole wheat, everything, sesame, blueberry, pumpkin, asiago, sprouted bagel. My favorite is sprouted bagel and pumpkin bagel for the season. Their garlic herb cream cheese and honey nut cream cheese is just delicious!!! very friendly staff, quick checkup process, excellent membership deals!! atmosphere is great too, less people in the morning, evening are busy and crowded, still was able to find a place. So many options under 10 dollar, this is definitely a go if you haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"Great service great location. The food consistent as other locations as 4 stars. Would be nice it the patio had more trees bit it doesn't. Patio a bit too close to traffic."}
{"text":"What a God send! Panera was one of the very few restaurants in the area that was open on a Sunday! 

I was driving around the area on the verge of becoming very hangry, which can be a dangerous thing since I can cross the line very quickly (ask my hubby). I was so relieved to find Panera close by. I walked in and their special caught my eye - Mediterranean Egg White Breakfast Sandwich with Vermont White Cheddar, tomato sofrito, spinach with a nut-free basil pesto on a Ciabatta. I ordered the sandwich with an Iced Mocha with whipped cream. The cashier was a trainee and had to have a manager come and help her, no worries there was no line up.

At Panera after you order and pay at the front, you go to the pick up counter where the barista makes your drink and the kitchen staff makes your food. My order came out quick (that's why I like ordering sandwiches because the wait time is super short, same with salads). Would you guess that my drink order was wrong *sigh* I told the Barista of the error and with a smile he said \"no problem\" and even asked if I wanted to keep the wrong drink as well. I can tolerate mistakes just as long as the mistake is fixed and the staff are considerate. A breakfast sandwich and two drinks for $6.99 OH YEAH! 

The sandwich was delicious with fresh, savory ingredients in a crusty just baked Ciabatta bun. They bake all their bread in house as well as their pastries. My iced mocha was weak in caffeine strength but still tasty. I've had salads and other sandwiches here and they've all been consistently good. 

Open early with lots of seating space inside and out, with a number of booths as well. For big groups they combine the small tables. There was a large group enjoying their breakfast in the back while I was there.

So much better than a microwaved, greasy fast food breakfast any day!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a great lunch & sit awhile. The food is always great but it's always over $10 & super crowded. They now have a rent-a-cop at lunch time directing traffic in the parking lot. Not sure if it's the tight squeeze, lack of parking or not many lunch choices in Southpark, but it's busy. Be prepared."}
{"text":"Great staff. They delivered to my car because I could not run inside. Missed the extra dressing I asked for but no biggie."}
{"text":"It tasted good because it is Panera!! But I don't really like their service. The guy who looked like a manager gave hi and ask about the food to everyone except for us. WHY!!!! I do not think it was his mistake. Because it was not the first time. So my friend and I never go this branch again. Simple!"}
{"text":"I posted a picture of an \"Apple\" from my most recent trip to Panera...I've had consistently poor food from this location. I have eaten at Panera's nationwide and usually have a good experience. I've been to this location by my house half a dozen times and always left underwhelmed. Slow service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"As many people that crowd this Panera Bread, there should be more reviews for this place! This is a hangout spot for a lot of people, including me. They are a great place to grab breakfast, lunch, and dessert. Their hot sandwiches are delicious and I always get the chips with one, even though you also have the choice of a baguette or apple. I took the unhealthy route with chips, but they're pretty good.

Their bagels are a staple there. My favorite is the French Toast and the honey walnut cream cheese is to die for.

Their breakfast sandwich, the Power Breakfast Sandwich, or whatever it's called, is really good and you should try it was sausage instead of ham and add some jelly.

The pastries are also really good. The mini Pineapple Upside Down cake is delicious and not too sweet. Their brownies are some of the best I've had from a to-go food place. The chocolate chip cookies (get them in the bag) are so good, I'm curious how they get them to be that good.

I'm a die hard Panera fan and I recommend you go because there are options for everyone."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from Panera frequently since they started delivery....but damn, their delivery is hit or miss.   Sometimes we get all of our order...sometimes we don't.   One of things they seem to always forget is our drinks...so the delivery driver tells us they will do something, and we never hear from them.  Now we call the place.....and they are very apologetic; however, it does nothing to rectify the situation at hand with everyone at work eating lunch and no drinks.   They do offer us to come in and they will give us free lunch..??  We paid for delivery so that we don't have to go in!  Beware of ordering delivery from here this Panera......I think my office will not be ordering again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I live near here and have eaten in at least a dozen times.  Not once have they made a mistake in an order .  I get a Lot of to go orders .   Great because no matter what you feel like eating, they will have it in the menu.

Always good quality.

I miss the turkey Chile!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely don't go to this place at night Panera bread Ha! I ordered a broccoli and cheddar bread bowl and got no bread bowl after the fact I was told that they were out of bread the girl standing right behind me waiting for her order also heard the same thing and had ordered a bread bowl as well out of bread how do you run out of bread at Panera BREAD?  and if you do don't you think that it would be a good idea to tell people that you're out of bread bowls instead of continually ringing customers up back to back for bread bowls that are going to receive what they ordered. Not to mention I couldn't even get a refund because the whole entire soccer team came in for 20+ girls immediately after I received my incorrect order my cup of broccoli and cheddar"}
{"text":"Very busy in this Panera Bread location at lunch time. Long line up for food or even coffee. $14 for 4 drinks. Was it a bad visit? Not necessarily, but I just think there are so many other options, I'm not sure under exactly what circumstances I'd choose Panera over something else."}
{"text":"I've been to this location three times (all drive-thru), and have had issues during two of my visits. 
First visit: I ordered the bacon turkey bravo sandwich. Before I left, I checked the sandwich and it had turkey, lettuce, and onion....
.... the bacon turkey bravo has BACON, lettuce, tomato, turkey, and cheese. I ended up going inside and an employee (don't know his name) prepared another sandwich for me, the correct way.
Second visit: I checked my food before leaving, and all was well. 
Third visit (tonight): Like always, I ordered the bacon turkey bravo. This time the sandwich had all the correct ingredients, but, the tomatoes were cut into wedges... yeah, wedges... on a sandwich. 
I ended up calling three times and finally got through to a manager. She didn't say much, not sure if she truly cared, so here I am. 
No clue why I've only had problems with this location, but it definitely seems like they need to train their employees again, because they don't know what they're doing when it comes to preparing menu items. 
This is what my sandwich shit out:"}
{"text":"The food was good my problem was the girl Leslie who took our order was the embodiment of bad customer service.  She was so rude and condescending, that it completely ruined my entire dinning experience. Not to mention that she also messed up the order. I will not be returning to this establishment for this sole reason. I will also recommend to my friends to avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Too many non paying customers hogging up all the tables.   Please put a limit on how long someone hangs out on your wifi.   I'm sure you would rather have the $$$$$.   Sure customers have drinks(water).  I have brought this to your attention so many times...  Nothing ever changes!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience at panera (over $10 may I add). Where to start? As I waited over 8 minutes for a pick 2 with salad and a blt, I enjoyed the numerous managers walk back and forth without offering the lonely 2 employees any assistance. As the first person in line, I was entertained by watching the line behind me grow and the orders on the screen accumulate. The manager did I great job supervising the poor salad maker as he asked for more eggs to which the manager replied they were in the back, sarcastically I may add. This lead to the salad maker having to leave his station to go get the eggs all while 3 managers, the sarcastic one included, walked around too entitled to be bothered with a task that was obviously beneath them. My absolute favorite part of my visit was watching a lovely female manager get in the way of the salad maker to make her OWN FOOD as the line behind me continued to grow. The cashiers were lovely and so were the food preparers. Could I apply to be a manager there? I too love getting paid to do nothing!
sincerely,
A very unimpressed first customer

On a side note, I have worked in the food service industry for almost 14 years. Everything from downtown high volume venues to fine dining. I am not a jaded person who complains often so please take this criticism seriously."}
{"text":"I went there for the pastries.  I had a cinnamon bun and a large muffin.   They were pretty standard pastries, good, but not super outstanding, still went well with a cup of coffee.   

I saw that their hot breakfasts seemed to be pretty popular.  People generally enjoyed decent portions of food.   Next time I'm in need of breakfast I will check it out.

Oh...they have a loyalty card, that gives a free pastry when you sign up, and another free pastry when it's your birthday.  :-)"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've eaten at Panera Bread, so it bummed me out when I learned that the Turkey Artichoke Panini was discontinued, and my \"You Pick Two\" combo might as well have been a kid's meal. 

Maybe this isn't the case for other Panera Breads, but my sandwich was tiny.  I was recommended the Roasted Turkey & Avocado BLT as a substitute for my Turkey Artichoke. Can't say I'm a fan. They held out on the toppings, but then again how much can you fit on two tiny pieces of bread? I also ordered a Caesar salad. Definitely did I receive more salad than sandwich. If there's a lesson to be learned from my experience, it's order the full sandwich rather than going for the, \"You Pick Two.\" My boyfriend ordered the Italian Combo Sandwich that looked more like a real meal rather than a snack. 

The service was fine, and the restaurant is much more spacious than other Panera Breads that I've visited. 

Overall, I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Only go here if you want hard stale bread and sandwiches so small you'll need 5 to make a complete meal. My chicken walnut sandwich literally had one bite of chicken salad and the rest was wilted lettuce and tomato.  I won't even get into how the cashier screwed up our order so we had to order twice and it ended up being more money than it would have been if they'd gotten it right the first time. Total fail and will not be back. Wish Paradise Bakery was still here. Much better quality and product."}
{"text":"I love Panera's salads and French onion soup. Yum! However, when it comes to eating at this location, I usually just order online so I don't have to deal with the extremely unprofessional employees. 

Most of the time, the employees are grumpy, rude, and flat out don't care about the customers or the food. For instance, one time when I visited, the employees were passing around a baby in the food prep area, another girl was throwing things at another employee's backside (totally ignoring me as I tried to order at the register). I've had cold food more than once. A friend of mine had to witness the employees yelling expletives at each other as he ate. It has gotten slightly better recently, so I'm assuming they have new management and/or employees. I was given a few coupons for my poor experience after I called Panera's headquarters. 

The restaurant is usually clean and they are efficient at getting orders filled quickly."}
{"text":"Delicious bread bowls! And for $5 who can complain! Great deal! It's the perfect place to get something exceptionally yummy. Excellent comfort food! I got the cheddar and broccoli soup in the bread bowl. It was filling by itself. My husband got the chicken noodle and he said it was tasty as well.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the best sandwhich i ever had was the California Turkey at Paradise Bakery and Cafe!!! Everything is good here, especially the salads! I like the fact they offer half portions of the soup, salads, and sandwhiches!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch discovered it was a bad choice.  Restroom stinks and sink over flowing.  Told manager I. Training and she acted like she did not care.  Very pricey for food.  First and last visit."}
{"text":"I love the food, and two of the associates working the drive window (Rylee & a male I didn't catch his name) have fantastic customer service however, I'm so sick of going to this location and not getting my order right. 3x this has happened!! First time they forgot my soup, 2nd time which was last week they gave me the wrong soup, now today I ordered on the app. and was missing a sandwich. So I had to go in when I told the girl I was missing my sandwich her response \"oh, we ran out of that bread\" I was like okaaaay??? Obviously they need to find a better way to communicate w/ other associates, and  double check orders. I might give this location one more chance but if they mess up I might lose my sh*t!"}
{"text":"I have to be clear when ordering because the organization and methodology and lingo of the menu can be confusing to both the orderer and the orderee but when things don't go well they will make it right. The food quality is great. I come here a lot and realize that if you are in a hurry it is hit and miss regarding getting exactly what you want in a timely manner. But after thinking about what I want in a restaurant, I put food quality up high above speed because there is always a health price to pay when you go the McDonald's route. I order the whole Greek salad regularly because it's yummy!  And the employees are really cool too."}
{"text":"It's nice that you can get healthy food fast but it does come with a big price. $8 for a half Riley club sandwich seems like too much to me.
The last time I went for lunch I had a summer salad topped with avocado, corn chip pieces and chicken. The chicken was of terrible quality. I spoke with a staff member and she immediately knew I was going to complain about the chicken. She said the supplier had changed and they too weren't happy with the chicken they were now receiving. She gave me a gift card for the cost of the meal ($15), for which I was very grateful but I do not feel they should be serving questionable meat like that of which i had in my salad. 
I won't be heading back any time soon."}
{"text":"Love the Asiago Cheese Bagels, but not a big fan of their sandwiches or salads, nor their very limited sides, especially at their high prices. For $8 hubby got the Smokehouse Turkey Panini, which was okay, and the side was a bag of chips. My Strawberry Poppyseed & Chicken Salad, while large, was meh. The chicken was not seasoned or tasty at all. I couldn't even eat half."}
{"text":"Panera has very good food and service.  My amazing boyfriend and I love coming here for the bear claw pastries!  The tomato soup is very nice and the bread that the sandwiches are made from are always fresh.  We will continue to come to this location."}
{"text":"Needs more registers in the mornings. Mildly unorganized. But the breakfast sandwich is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I love me some Panera, but they must be really off their game tonight at this location. The staff was running around playing and being really loud. They were already closing things up at 8:30 pm when the closing time is 10:00 pm. The cashier was on her phone while ringing me up. Almost everyone on staff had ear buds in and took forever to get the food. It wasn't busy at all. There was one person in front of us and no one after us for 15 minutes. Well over 20 minutes before getting our food. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"This is one of the few Panera locations that I've been too and each visit is always good. First off, the staff are always great and enjoy talking to their customers. They are very friendly and nice. There is a good amount of seating and no matter what time of day you come, the service is quick and efficient. In addition, the food is always fresh and delicious no matter what items you decide to get. However, the desserts are sometimes a little hard and stale most likely because they sit for some time. Occasionally they will get part of your order wrong but they are more than happy to fix whatever mistake they made. The main complaint I have is that it's always really cold in this restaurant. Even with a jacket on, the cold still finds a way to get to you."}
{"text":"I eat at Panera usually a couple of times a month at different locations. This particular location was not on it's A game this week. We walked in with no line. However, there was no greeting either by the cashier. She was standing behind the register looking into space. Standing right in front of her, I had to initiate the hello. Maybe she worked a long shift. Either way you could tell she wasn't excited to be there. They were out of chicken noodle soup. How is that even possible? The turkey chili was good. Portion sizes seem to decrease quite frequently. We were offered a free pastry because of our rewards. It was stale...so that was wasted as I'm guessing it sat out all day. Should have thought about that first. Not a great experience at all."}
{"text":"Worst service by Panera standards.  How hard is it to make a drink in the correct size when there is only one size listed on the menu.  When I asked about the error, they made me go back in li e to speak to the person at the cash register like I was making it up.

When they person brought my correct drink there was no apology for recognition of the mistake.  

Basically to fix their error, the poured the drink into a larger cup and filled the rest up with milk.

The sign of true lazy workers."}
{"text":"Although it is expensive, this has become a family favorite. Elizabeth was the best! Give it a shot, and if Elizabeth is helping you, it's bound to be a good experience! The picture is my disappointment from my next visit. Ordered a turkey sandwich and as you can see, it is lacking of turkey. Maybe my original thoughts of this place being nice were too much."}
{"text":"I normally love eating with Panera but this location is the worst I've ever experienced. The staff is great but their management needs adjusting. Any issue you have is guaranteed accompanied with attitude. If you want your order wrong or canceled, dine here."}
{"text":"So, this place is an enigma. The morning staff is wonderful, I've never had a problem then. Quick, friendly and efficient.

The afternoon/evening staff though... different story.

A couple weeks ago, I was waiting for my food, and a girl in the food prep area was doing nothing but loudly complaining in front of the customers about how she hated being there on a day that was supposed to be her day off. I know, we've all seen Clerks, \"I'm not even supposed to be here today\". We've all been there. But in front of customers, really? Her manager didn't even chastise her. Just let her loudly complain.

I was there again Saturday night. Walked in, huge line, only one person at the register. They opened up another register while I was there. Sure, okay, groovy. Ordered our food.

Then we wait. While we're waiting, we're watching the prep staff again. Oh hey, that same girl is back there making food, complaining. Apparently her scissors weren't working. Rather than, you know, going to get a new pair of freaking scissors, she walks around behind the counter, holding the scissors blade first towards her coworkers, trying to get them to work, and complaining nonstop. Not helping prep at all. A good 8 people or so were standing around waiting for their food. Things behind the counter were slow, I think her coworkers were more concerned about being stabbed by this idiot employee than, you know, working.

I get it. Panera staff aren't paid much. But still, it is their job. I spent $40 on a bowl of soup, two mac and cheeses, a Caesar salad, a loaf of bread, and a sandwich. That's a lot of money for so little food. I waited almost 20 minutes for it to be done. At 7:30 on a Saturday. They should be staffed better.

Finally another employee brings this worthless girl new scissors. This girl had been complaining directly to her manager on staff in the prep area; the manager didn't seem to care. Customers were getting visibly frustrated by the delay.

Finally we get our food. We go home without checking the bag. A mistake, of course. No salad, after 20 minutes of waiting and listening to this dumb employee complain. I'm already in my pajamas.

I call the store, the girl who answers says that she can enter me into the log for a replacement salad that I can come get some other time. I explain to her that we wanted it now, because, you know, it was our freaking dinner. She puts me on with her manager, the same one who gave zero shits about her employee walking around with essentially a weapon and complaining. I told her to have it ready when I get there, which at least she did, as I walked in in pajamas.

Seriously, these people should be glad I'm not their manager. I'd be firing to the walls like I would if my own employees acted this way.

So, morning crew: you rock. Keep it up. Evening crew: get rid of that idiot employee, hire a couple more people, and get with it. This food is way too expensive to have to wait that long and be \"treated\" to employees that complain about their job in front of customers."}
{"text":"I generally don't like to leave reviews about poor customer service because i know we all have our bad days, but one worker here seems to have a lot of them. Two times I have ordered a hot drink and it has come out iced, ok, these things happen, no big deal. When I asked for it to be fixed, the woman (who was wearing what appeared to be a managers shirt, I should have gotten her name one of the times) acted as if I was lying and inconveniencing her. She did not offer an apology, let me keep the old drink, or anything else to make up for the inconvenience. That's  fine, if she felt like I was lying then I can see why none of this would be offered.  Still, it doesn't feel good to be treated as a liar when I'm just trying to get what I paid for. Both times, when she fixed my drink, it came back in a medium cup even though I paid for a large. I suspected this, but did not confirm it until I got to work the second time and on the bottom of the cup's rim was \"16 oz\". My third interaction with her involved a morning where I went to order a coffee and the machine was broken, she stared at me while I debated what to do, did not offer any suggestions for a substitute drink, but suggested I go to the coffee shop down the street instead (again, acting very annoyed that she had a customer). I always try to be pleasant and understanding because I know food service can be a tough job, but I feel very disenchanted with this location."}
{"text":"Terrible service. First tables. Slow. Employees standing around. I apologize to the people who might work hard at this location but my experience on a Saturday afternoon did not reflect well."}
{"text":"Visited this location today. Customer service behind the counter was really bad. I asked what was on a certain sandwich and the clerk that had \"trainer\" on her badge appeared to ring it up, it came on the screen that it was $5.89 or so and I said \"oh I just want to know what's on the sandwich first\" and she \"yeah I know\" kind of sarcastically. I didn't realize that was the way it worked, then she told me what was on it so fast I I taken back. I am a young, educated person, there is no reason I shouldn't be able to understand you. Trying to finish the transaction I swiped my card, it said waiting and she said \"Ok, you're number is 80.\" I started to walk away and she said, \"are you going to pay me?\" I looked at the machine that I swiped my card in and it said waiting, yet she made it seem like we were finished. She was just really rude and fast talking with bad people and customer skills. The food was mediocre, and unfortunately I was sitting too close to the front counter and heard her fast talk and be snobby to the rest of the guests that passed through. At least I wasn't the only one. She is awful."}
{"text":"Food is good, service sucks never fails we always get the rude guy who seems to hate his job an the seating areas are always messy the last time I went I cleaned my own table because it was sticky an so where the seats I'll stick to making the drive to Henderson Panera"}
{"text":"THIS PANERA HAS A DRIVE-THRU! Never will you have to leave your car for Panera ever again! #FirstWorldProblems

The Steak and White Cheddar Panini is one of my favorites, as well as the Broccoli and Cheddar Soup, but Panera's menu is loaded with a plethora of healthy and delicious options! 

Considering this Panera opened not too long ago, and also considering the fact that a Panera having a Drive-Thru seems like an oxymoron, I was genuinely impressed with the speed in which we received our food! I honestly think we received our food faster in the drive-thru than we ever have dining inside of any Panera we've ever visited! 

Also, Laura was working the drive-thru window that day, and she was such a delight! So full of happiness and positive energy, you can't help but smile while in her presence! If you're visiting this Panera, I sincerely hope you encounter her so she can make your experience that much more memorable. 

Overall, it's Panera...with a drive-thru...and one of the nicest ladies to ever grace this planet. Craving sandwiches, soups, or salads? Go!"}
{"text":"Panera is expensive af. I mean we all know that but I've been getting to you pick 2 for years now.. But why on earth and I paying $6 for a half sandwich and $4 for a cup of soup?????? My total was almost $11 and I wasn't even full"}
{"text":"Average Panera Bread. We originally tried to have dinner at two different places in Lawrenceville. Both had hour+ waits. We were sick of walking in the cold looking for a place and headed for waterworks, since we were planning on Christmas shopping anyway 

I ordered half of a turkey avacado BLT as well as broccoli cheddar in a bread bowl... Bc you can't go to panera and nottt get a bread bowl. My sandwich was both filling (for a half) and satisfying. It was not turkey deli slices but thick chunks of turkey meat. 

Bobby ordered a chiptole turkey sandwich and soup/ bread bowl. He was also happy with the iced coffee dispenser.

Service was very kind. For some reason they didn't give out pagers, just yelled names. Also it gets a little cramped where food pick up and cold beverages are since it's narrow right there.  Other than that we were happy."}
{"text":"Average Panera.. My friend and I stopped here before Painting with a Twist. I ordered the Broccoli Cheddar soup in a bread bowl. She ordered the soup and sandwich deal. Nothing stuck out as good or bad to really review about. We enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"4 stars for fresh coffee, a delicious blueberry muffin and a relaxing vibe while our car was getting inspected. I was nervous that they wouldn't be open at 8am but luckily they opened at 630 on Saturdays. (woahh) 

Pastries all looked delicious. My muffin was fabulous!"}
{"text":"Panera is a great example of what happens when you sell your dream to a soulless corporation. Before Panera ruined everything this was Paradise Bakery.  A true Arizona original, with amazing food, great service, and delicious baked goods! Cherished by locals and snowbirds alike, you could always count on Paradise Bakery delivering a great experience. Now it's nothing but a cold, heartless cafeteria with screwed up orders and terrible service. If you want to know what the original vision was for Paradise Bakery read the article below.
I wonder if David Birzon or Dan Patterson have had the experience of eating at Panera since the conversion? My hunch is that they stay as far away as possible, which is what I plan on doing as well. It's sad that the dream has died but based on reviews I've read it's likely that  the nightmare won't last much longer.

{"text":"So after three months of pestering their customer service I finally get an e-mail back stating they believe this was an isolated incident and they will not be accepting any responsibility.  Honestly, even a freaking McDonald's would own up to their poor service more than this place.  I'm contacting the health department on them.  Will never ever EVER eat panera again.  Seriously, what a bunch of filthy scumbags."}
{"text":"Every time I go there I order chicken noodle soup in a bread bowl just to find out they are out of bread bowls. How do you always run out of bread bowls??? The workers are not very polite either :-( I won't go back instead I'll go to Safeway for my bread bowl and soup."}
{"text":"I came by earlier this month. I was starving and needed some fuel before going to the gym. I got a BBQ chicken grilled flatbread with spinach. Delicious. I was even surprised to see it come with free potato chips. Place was clean and comfortable. It got really busy when I was leaving. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's Panera.  The food is the same everywhere, so that certainly doesn't set this one apart (though I will say that a reduced fat blueberry muffin and unlimited refills on coffee have gotten me through more than one exam period).  What makes this one special is that the staff here have been working in this location almost since it opened.  They are friendly, warm, and cheerful (regardless of the time of morning you make it in) and actually remember my face, even though it's frequently months between visits.  I'm a big fan."}
{"text":"There aren't many places in Monroeville where I can sit with a cup of coffee, my laptop, and get some work done. This place barely fits the bill.

This premises is OK, but not great. For being so large, there are not many outlets. There is a meeting room (you can reserve) that is quieter than the rest, but they crank the AC so hard, you should bring a sweater even on 95º days.

The pastries all have that \"store bought\" texture. I see an extensive kitchen in the back, but the pastries must not come from there. I recently had the soup. I was looking forward to a nice bread bowl, but the creamy tomato had the flavor of spaghetti O's. If you really want a nice bread bowl, take the bread home and pour in your favorite can of chunky soup.

The saving grace is their drip coffee selection. They have DARK roast and HAZELNUT, among other flavors, that are replenished regularly. Coffee is bottomless if you stay in. 

But hey, any port in a storm I guess."}
{"text":"My new place to get fresh, fast, hot and delicious food!  It took me a while to finally find the time but have now been to two locations for lunch. I have now had their French onion soup, creamy tomato and today had the new corn chowder. Absolutely wonderful. The broth creamy, poblano peppers just the right sweet with a tiny bit of heat. Their unsweetened iced tea flavors are spectacular. I especially like the hibiscus one. For rapid pick up boy was it fast!  I had created my order on the app and as I created my payment (it took me a while) my lunch was waiting in the pick up area. And they have a drive thru! Awesome!  Great menu choices.  I will be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Panera bread and I truly enjoyed it. I had their bistro French onion soup in a bowl although next time I may try it in a bread bowl. It was hot and very flavorful with good size chunks of onion. I had the half turkey salad with Apple and cheddar on cranberry bread. The bread was fresh and had just a slight sweet taste to it. I even signed up for a Panera loyalty card. So now I will definitely be back to try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"Panera was a regular spot for meetings and lunches with friends when I lived in Chicago. It was always busy but very well maintained. Very bright and inviting.

This location is just as busy, especially during lunch. My issue is cleanliness. Tables are always dirty. Dirty dish bin kept overflowing. Fountain area cluttered and not consistently wiped down. Looks dingy and dark. Servers are hit or miss- polite or dismissive. 

Better coordination needed to keep tables clean.

Sometimes my food comes out and an menu item has run out. However, I am a fan of their salads and soups.

Hope management looks to improve quality of space and customer care."}

{"text":"Cashier (receipt says Courtney) has been rude to me multiple times. This time she had what appeared to be a friend, non-employee, hanging out up at the register. I stood patiently waiting and she never asked if she could help me. When another customer mentioned something, saying like 'hey move up and order', she acknowledged me and the other girl moved aside. As I ordered she batted her eyes and acted as though I was doing her a great disservice to be here ordering food from her. She is not polite in any way shape or form. I do expect you to tell me you're open to taking my order with something as simple as \"I can help the next customer here\" rather than screwing around and talking to your friend. Sorry for ruining your day!

I come back because its within walking distance to work.

This particular panera is otherwise pretty much on spot with other paneras. The food is okay, seems fresh, and the tables are, of course, dirty from the constant flow of patrons and the lack of employees coming to clean tables.

Lunch time is very busy here because of surrounding businesses."}
{"text":"Don't eat here.

Cashier, michelle, could not care less about her job and was rude. Perhaps had she been paying attention she would have gotten my order correct.

My turkey flat bread looked nothing like the photos and barely had any meat.

The baguette looked like someone had sat on it for an hour."}
{"text":"Great place to get a healthy bite to eat!  I just wish they'd figure out their stocking methods better.  We've been here a couple of times where the Special is already sold out and it's only mid-afternoon!  :-(

Otherwise, the food is extremely healthy as are the smoothy options.  The prices are moderate fair for a Downtown location.

They have free Wi-fi and the noise level is quite tolerable.  :-)"}

After a long day of catching villans dressed up as giant electric eels in order to scare off folks who might discover the giant vein of gold ore running a scant few inches underneath Old Man Jenkins' property nothing beats going to Panera and unwinding with a nice cup of coffee and a Frontega Chicken Sandwhich."}

{"text":"Just visited this place two days ago. I did not even know it wasn't Paradise Bakery anymore.  I was happy just to get parking at 1:30 in the afternoon. The half filled parking lot was what I noticed first as it was always always full on previous visits. Have not been on this side of the valley for months and can't remember the last time I was at Paradise bakery which is now Panera but frequented it a lot when I lived in that part of town

Sorry to drag it on. In short?  This place is not very good although I must say their Orange scone was very good. The chicken soup?  Tasted and looked like it came right out of a Campbell's soup can. The piece of bread that came with the soup was tasty. I had some sort of chicken and noodle bowl Asian style. It was worse then the soup. They drown the whole thing with the dressing. The noodles were horrible. The young girls working behind the counter were bright and friendly but the person bringing the meals to the tables seemed as disinterested in his job as one could be. 

They did not bring butter for the bread with the meal so I went up to where the table server was and asked him for some butter. It appeared like he could care less. Did not even look at me when I asked him for the butter. He just reached over the county where he was standing and out his hand out to me with one butter. I asked if I could have another. He did the same thing. Grabbed another butter and just handed it to me without looking at all in my direction. Really no big deal but the food was no big deal either. 

I have been to Panera in several other states and by far, this is the worst one I have ever been in food wise. I will not be returning to it."}
{"text":"The slowest Panera bread I've ever been to. Went in at 7:40am and left at 7:55 without my order so I wouldn't be late for work. I ordered a bagel and a cup of fruit. In previous experiences, this takes about five minutes to slice a bagel and put it in a bag. Had to leave without the food and without a refund. Ended up calling and the manager took my info to process the return. Heard many others in front of me complaining about the wait time who were also still waiting. Stay away if you're in need of a fast breakfast!"}
{"text":"Finally in Markham! Woohooo...I love you Panera Bread! You guys ROCK!

Always had to visit the RH location whenever I wanted a yummy delicious salad with quality and freshness..=D

Now, this is a place I will come often I believe...since it is much closer to home. I went on day after grand opening. Was lucky enough to get a FREE travel mug and 2 weeks of coffee...nothing beats free..oh yeah..=D

This location has alot of light and seats available. There is still construction outside therefore it may get dusty but its all good. The food quality is even better than the RH location I find...

Keep up on wonderful work!"}
{"text":"I order from Panera's Bread all the time! They deliver to my house like 2 times a week, if not more. Being a mother of 2 babies it's hard to go into places and get lunch. I am a rewards member so all my info is in their system. A couple days ago I order a tuna sandwich with extra tuna and avocado on the side. I paid for the extras. And never got them. When I open my sandwich all the tuna was on the wrapper barley any on the sandwich. I called a spoke to a very nice women manager and she said to just call when I'm ready for it and she will have it made for me no hassles. I called today to get my order and the General Manager Adrian Hernandez was very rude and jumpy like it was my fault they messed up my order totally gave me a crap about it. Saying he needs to know the managers name and the exact day I order. I told him it was just a couple of days ago and that it should be in their system because I am a loyal customer. I gave him my info but he insisted on me knowing the exact day. Which I didn't know of hand. I would have to hang up to go on my app. apparently he was to lazy to look it up. Needless to say they lost a loyal customer because the GENERAL MANAGER doesn't know how to politely talk to customers and do his job."}
{"text":"What the Heck is this? Burned bread and a slice of cheese. Anyone else see their glamour shot of their grilled cheese? Crap is so hard and smelly, that's its nearly impossible to eat. Gonna be some time before I spend cash on overpriced and bad food again. You can't even bite into this cardboard garbage. Hate this place."}
{"text":"Ahh panera bread, the much talked about soup and sandwich, salad and soup restaurant....

I've been to many panera's in the past few years and to be honest, it's hit and miss.
This past visit was definitely a miss.

First off, while the menu is large, the prices are steep for a soup/sandwich/salad place. Your looking at $15+ per person.

I ordered the 2 item combo, half salad, half sandwich. Tuna salad sandwich and chicken cobb salad. 
I asked to substitute the blue cheese for cheddar (and charged extra, unbeknownst to me) and got my sandwich on whole wheat bread because *surprise* they were out of any other type.
My husband got a salad, sandwich and soup. Was informed that they were out of rolls, so he could only get chips to dip in his soup... Lovely.

Once we got our order, my salad was covered in blue cheese and had no chicken..... Wtf? I sent it back and waited 10 minutes for a new one. My sandwich was soggy and sloppy, I could have made a nicer one at home. My salad was okay once it cane back correct, however it was just okay.

Another member of my party's order was also wrong and had to be re-made.

The atmosphere is nice and the restaurant is clean and welcoming but the service was just awful.... I honestly don't get how a chain restaurant can be out of certain items by 6pm on a Saturday... It's called being prepared.

Sigh you know it's a lacklustre visit when an elite doesn't even take pictures.

{"text":"Broccoli cheddar soup bread bowl is the best invention ever. It's pretty shady I can't get my smoke house turkey panini anymore though BRING IT BACK!! I love your breakfast, but I need more coupon  incentives to spend that much $$ on breakfast"}
{"text":"I'm at this Panera often. My order is always as I requested and delivered to me on time. Love that I earn generous awards for eating such great food."}
{"text":"I have usually liked Panera Bread, as I feel it is one of the more healthy fast food chains.  I would say that this location has great customer service.  I do feel like the food is overpriced for what you get.  

I am mainly writing to complain about the Quick Pick Up.  Today I took the time to order online at the Panera Bread website.  I did not want to go inside panera bread because at the time I was sweaty from working out and was covered in dog hair.  I got to the drive thru to pick up my food.  Apparently you can not get the quick pick up by the drive thru!  What is quick about having to park my car and go into Panera Bead?  Also, the quick delivery is just sitting on a shelf.  I did not have to prove I actually ordered with the emailed receipt.  So in conclusion, I do not understand why I had to go inside and pick up my food.  Couldn't some one walk a few feet and give it to me in the drive thru?  
Secondly, I feel like anyone could just claim the quick delivery food before I arrive.  They would be getting a free meal!  Love the idea of online ordering but not at all convenient!"}
{"text":"I have waited a long time for Panera to make it out to Phoenix and I'm less then impressed so far. Parking is awful during the lunch rush. I came in, ordered, paid $13 for a half sandwich, soup and large drink. Pastries are $.99 extra. Pepsi products only with a few tea options. My food took almost 20 minutes to get, thank goodness I get an hour for lunch! Seating spaces are awkward unless you get a booth. I would rather get the cookie instead of the roll with my meal, which I didn't even eat. My turkey avocado BLT on sourdough was good, as well as my fuji apple chicken salad. Food runners were constantly confused of where orders were going and was asked several times if random orders were mine. I know they just opened but they certainly have a lot of kinks to work out before I come back."}
{"text":"Chicken flatbread please...uhmmmmmm CHICKEN and ON A FLATBREAD?? 4th time in 5 visits order was TERRIBLE... wrong bread AGAIN and layers of thick cheese to disguise no, spinach, chicken or onion...NEVER AGAIN THIS STORE!!! Take the tip!!!"}
{"text":"Evan is RUDE and has messed up my orders multiple times. Do something about this young lady."}
{"text":"Normally a great place, but this location is in need of a good cleaning, restrooms are a smelly mess and the carpet is in need of a good vacuuming.  The service is slow, I can handle that, but when they ignore you that's bad.  This is the second time I've stopped at this location and it's the same. Perhaps the buy outward a bag thing?"}
{"text":"Just a great chain with good healthy food.  Yes they are growing up and getting non GMO sources."}
{"text":"This is the third time I've been to this location and I think it will be the last. Panera already has high prices but the food is really good so you decide. 
Today my chicken salad croissant was a joke. There was enough lettuce for three sandwiches but barely enough chicken salad for a half. The croissant was hard and when I picked up the sandwich, EVERYTHING except the lettuce fell out. I had to eat my sandwich with a knife and fork. Yes, I said a knife. 
So all in all paying $8 for a sandwich could be acceptable if its a good size or even made well but this Panera location doesn't seem to care about pleasing their customers. I will not be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I do everything we can to avoid this location. We prefer the Arizona and Ocotillo location. My latest mess with this place included the manager coming out to tell me they ran out of the bread I already dosed for as I am type 1 diabetic. After finally deciding on a \"close enough\" bread my meal came out with no chicken in the salad. It was a Chicken Salad!!! Man I can't stand this place. I only stop here when it's absolutely imperative I do so."}
{"text":"I met up with my girlfriend and we grabbed lunch here. I've been to a few different Panera across the country and this one was just as good as any other. My order was correct, I usually order the bread bowl with cream of chicken and wild rice soup (SO DELICIOUS!). I love that they deliver your food but that you don't have a server. Their food is on the healthy side and quality. I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Service was poor. The young girl (Blair) who checked me out for my cookie was extremely rude! I proceed to her register, I ask for a toffee cookie, she screams \"are you talking to me?!\" With an attitude- lots of \"Tude\" Wth- I'm baffled as to why she is yelling- I'm thinking ok maybe she has a hearing problem or something. But no, she apparently thought I was on my phone because I had one ear piece in my ear- really lady, I'm going to ask someone on the phone for a toffee cookie, when I'm standing in line with obvious eye contact with her. Smh. I just don't get why she was so unhappy that day. Nevertheless management just needs to work on customer service with her- it may have been a personality thing, but I'm in customer service and I always tell my employees \"leave your attitudes and your problems in the car- when you get off work they'll still be there waiting on ya\"... But seriously there was no need for the attitude and poor customer service from her. I simply just wanted a toffee cookie - that's it!"}
{"text":"I just went there today during my girlfriend's lunch break. We both got the pick 2 and sharing one large lemonade drink and the total was a little over $20. I say it is quite pricey for my range, especially whenever the quality was not the best. My sandwich was quite small, seems like a 5 inch size. The bread tasted like cardboard, looks toasted but probably wasn't because it was cold and my cheese was not melted. The soup was good but salty and I felt like it was more like a sauces dish than a soup. It taste well with the roll that came with it but if you eat it individually, it is not good. I cannot even describe the depressing experience this was. And yes, it was a take out order, eventually they even messed up on my girlfriend's soup; giving us the same soup when we actually ordered different ones. The environment seemed nice and ordering from their tablet looking device was a good experience. The lemonade however seemed really fresh, just a bit too sour to be drinking a large drink. I might give it a second chance but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I ALMOST gave up on trying after multiple fails on rude service and being so unorganized.  The past few times have been a great & cheerful experience though.  They definitely got it together and found a team that works!!  I never met a soup I did not like at panera!!"}
{"text":"I changed my view about Panera bread after visiting Virginia this morning here. The new bowl a boiled egg with baby spinach in a bowl was too sour for me even I'm an Asian eating dumplings with vinegar in low sodium soy sauce. 
They delivered chicken salad to me by mistake, yet they told me to keep it since my pad did sY number 3.
Virginia was nice to swap the bread I ordered after I showed her my missing teeth.
Couldn't chew that French bread even I can save the outside layer for my hubby.
I ate all the fresh  ingredients, packed that sour leftover vinegar to add my red pepper and broccoli pieces later for late night snacks."}
{"text":"Fair food,  nothing great. Cute new decor but not worth trip. Seems like three set up will be fast when busy.  Just not very good and the price is OK but not great"}
{"text":"I stopped here because I had a sweet welcome reward to use. I haven't been here in years. The last time I was here I was not impressed. The place was dirty. This time it looked spotless! There is nice lighting and plenty of comfy seats to sit at.
The hazelnut coffee is so good! And it's set out for your convenience! Free refills?! Say what?! Hells yes! Plenty of sugars honey , spices, half and half, and skim milk to add to your cup. The sweet treats look delicious. It was hard to choose what free treat I wanted. I went with the cranberry orange muffin. Muffins are my weakness. Th cookies looked really good with different pastries and scones. They have a nice food menu for breakfast lunch and dinner. I already had lunch so I did not try out. The prices seem a lil steep for a soup, salad, sandwich, or pasta. But eh it is a chain. I just love the coffee and the environment. Privacy and relaxation. 
The one downside, big downside..where is the charger stations? I don't see any unless I'm blind. Not convenient. My phone is dying and my laptop is half broken so it needs to stay on a charge to work. Ghetto I know. There is free WiFi!! One point added
The staff is so pleasant and helpful. I had no idea what I was doing so the cashier helped me out tremendously!
If you download the app and sign u, you will receive a free sweet treat, like I did. You can also order ahead and pick up quickly on the app! Good for people on a short lunch break. 
Overall it's a nice place to unwind and enjoy some good coffee and food. Just bring your wallet, it's a bit pricey. I'd recommend."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to pick up lunch. A newer location opened up closer to my home but I just feel comfy and familiar at this PB. Being a bakery and cafe, they offer lunch and breakfast. They have some tasty options when it comes to breakfast you can choose from bagels, pastries, souffles, breakfast sandwiches and fresh baked bread. It wouldn't be breakfast if coffee wasn't offered so they do have a nice variety of options for that too. The lunch menu is my favorite. I love that they introduce new salads & sandwiches, but also love that they bring back old seasonal favorites. The \"You Pick 2\" option is great. I love that I can switch it up between soup, salad, and sandwiches. I have eaten inside this location a couple times, but usually just phone my order in and pick it up. They have a program called \"My Panera\" that you should look into if you plan on eating here more then once. You can earn free food and other cool stuff. I am able to log in online and check the status of my rewards. Please note that currently if you have a freebie and don't use it for 60 days that it will expire. This last visit I saw a sign that they offer catering. I never thought of PB for catering needs, but I bet it is a big hit at most offices. 

My absolute favorite sandwich from PB is the \"Roasted Turkey Artichoke Panini\"and it really hit the spot last night it is so good! I get the \"Broccoli Cheddar Soup\" and love dipping my panini into it. Such a nice combo and a comforting meal no matter what time of year it is. I'm glad we have PB!

This location is in a small strip mall with other popular places and the parking lot can be packed. Patience is key!"}
{"text":"Never again. Worst customer service experience. I came in to work on school work as the libraries were closed. I often come to Panera (though usually the one off Green) and have never been treated so poorly. Guess it's my fault for switching locations!

I had been working in a booth, when I came in there were several large meetings going on around the larger tables, so choosing a booth away from them made sense, right? My father called me for a quick but important phone call. I'd been on the phone for less than two minutes when dear manager Mike Maloney decided it was appropriate to try to talk to me. I said \"Excuse me I'm on the phone with my father can I speak to in a minute?\" Of course this did not appease him so he chose to speak louder saying \"I'm only going to ask you to move to a smaller table..\" at which point I again said \"Excuse me I will speak to you in a moment.\" 

As a paying customer first of all are you kidding me? I was here first. I'm quiet, working on my school work, not bothering anyone. I'm not loudly holding a conversation or holding a screaming toddler. All around me I see several people sitting at tables that made for more than one person, but clearly interrupting a phone quick call was appropriate. I'm currently sitting next to the freezing door on a dirty table. Never again Panera.

Starbucks, I see the error of my ways. Forgive me."}
{"text":"Made an online order and the whole order was not delivered. Tried calling TEN times to let them know I had a missing item and no one would answer the phone. Very frustrated with this location. Am I supposed to just lose out on my order AND my money?"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a lot of space with tables, seats, and booths if you want to hang out with some friends for a while. The cashier was very nice in her conversation. My order was prepared very fast. I enjoyed the taste of my broccoli cheddar soup and baguette. The bacon in my BLT roasted turkey avocado sandwich was soggy and not as good as I have eaten at other locations of Panera."}
{"text":"We typically love Panera but this location is ridiculous. They are out of just about everything because \"they had a busy morning\". It's at an airport, of course it's busy. And the wait is horrendous, avoid them like the plague."}
{"text":"You guys are often very good, however a pet peeve or call it what you want - you guys run out of ALL your bagels by 7:30- 8:30AM WAYYY to often; has happened at least once per week for me the last two months. Bad business practice. Cost pennies on the dollar to make bagels, make more."}
{"text":"Worst service and food around. Don't ever have a problem at Panera. They'll tell you to contact corporate, who will, long story short, basically make it so inconvenient and embarrassing to be reimbursed, that you'll just give up and say: \"nevermind, you bastards!\" 

Several bad experiences. As I often say, I don't want people to grovel. I don't expect anyone (let alone, kids) to get everything perfect all of the time, but y'all: I've experienced several mistakes. 50/50 chance that my drive-thru order is off. That's okay - just don't treat me like I'm a dick when I try to rectify it. Once, I asked, immediately, if I could just simply get my $2 back for my old, hard choc chip cookie (advertised as hot out of the oven). They said no. I hadn't touched it or anything. 

Prices are ridiculous. I'll pay for quality. This is not quality. Hell no! 

I had an epiphany: it really is just Campbell's soup, TV dinners (TV dinners rival their pasta), undercooked sandwiches, and iceberg lettuce (with chicken comparable to Subway...gag). 

Not a fan."}
{"text":"They were out of Mac and Cheese, then the chicken in my sandwich was frozen. I gave 2 stars because the manager comp'd my drink and seemed really nice because they were out of the Mac and cheese, but then I went home and found out I got a chicken ice cube sandwich instead."}
{"text":"So it takes 25 minutes to get a simple breakfast sandwich because the 5 tables in here make them really busy... they have more employees than a McDonalds yet move half as fast. Next time we will go to PT's . Better service!"}
{"text":"I love panera and I'm so happy there's finally one near me but I still hate that the large bowl for an in-house order is bigger than the large to-go order. for the price, I want the same amount. But I still love their bagettes! they'd be PERFECT if they came a little warmer and a little less stale."}
{"text":"No longer have the autumn squash soup so I ordered black bean. Went to the counter to get it and I asked for sour cream.  Was told, rather abruptly, that they don't have sour cream. Tell them I wouldn't have ordered it then. The manager was gathering the orders together and she asked if I wanted something else. I did appreciate the offer and chose another soup. However, they seemed rather perturbed because I wanted a condiment that they didn't offer."}
{"text":"This place is now Panera, all remodeled and they stepped up their game. Great food and service."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm done with this location. Usually slow service, today there were two cashier's, one went to fix a drink for her customer, the other finished with her customer and just walked away, leaving me waiting to order. LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE"}
{"text":"Panera's used to be great in that it was quick, healthy and had a drive through but this location is the worst. Not only are they slow, forget things and the quality of be food prep is bad (way over dressed salads, fatty chicken, cold food, etc.) but I found an object of some sort in my soup and almost chipped my tooth. Yuck. So gross I can only imagine the issues with filth there."}
{"text":"I was with a group of friends and wanted to eat lite that day. I had no idea how lite it would truly be after ordering half a Chinese Chicken Salad. Paid $6 dollars and change and got about $2 worth of food here. There was enough chicken in there to fill your back tooth. The dressing was good but very little else included in this item but some cabbage and a few crispy noodles. I can think of may other places to spend $6.00 and get my money's worth."}
{"text":"I arrived at 12:30 middle of lunch only one cashier. I asked if there's another cashier she's on the line helping. Oh go use the kiosk that'll be much faster and you can get your order in. The kiosk is way too complicated takes too long to find your stuff they have no arugula the tomato mozzarella flatbread which sucks. It timed out because it took me so long to figure out how to order lost my order had to go up to the cashier anyway by that time six other customers had been helped. And they had added another cashier when I walked away. This may be in the Sun City area but not everybody is a senior citizen and has 2 hours to spend at lunch. Some of us still have to work and go back to work and don't have a half hour to wait for them to serve you your food. Most aggravating experience."}
{"text":"Never thought I'd imagine a Panera Bread this far north. So when I came back to Toronto to visit my parents, I happened to swing up this way to try out a new sushi restaurant. To my surprise, I see Panera Bread. Having not had any Panera Bread in weeks, I immediately went into withdrawal. So out go the sushi plans in went Panera Bread. 

I wasn't sure if the food would taste the same here but to my surprise, the french onion soup tasted just like the french onion soup and the tomato mozzarella tasted just like the tomato mozzarella from the States.

The thing I love about this place is the bread. The bread is what makes or breaks the sandwich. Their french bread is ridiculously good and I always get it with the sandwiches instead of the apples of chips. The chips suck btw so don't get it."}
{"text":"This new layout is irritating at best - no sweetener over by the drinks - ie unsweetened tea ... irritating!!!"}
{"text":"Do not get delivery from them it will take over 2 hours and your order will be wrong so they will go back and try to remake it... The worst!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean environment, yummy pastries. Definitely a good place to study (read procrastinate) when you need a break from the library. My favorites are their artisan chocolate pastry and asiago bagel (yum)."}
{"text":"Swing by here to grab a salad Togo before a flight. They lady checking me out was friendly and patient with my complicated order. 
They need more people in the kitchen though. I had to wait 15 minutes to get my food because there were only two people in the kitchen during the beginning of lunch time..
Sprouted roll was a bit stale. Shouldn't have been the case at 11 am.. Greek salad with chicken was delicious though!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here for a cup of coffee and dessert. The coffee was fresh and delicious. The carrot cake cupcake he ordered was neither! It seemed old. It was hard and very dry. He ended up throwing it away. This Panera was not as clean as the one near Concord Mills that we usually go to either."}
{"text":"I love Panera. The food is fresh, healthy and delicious. This Panera has lots of cozy seating and just added a drive thru, which is awesome!"}
{"text":"I love Panera's salads. I like that I can order at the kiosk and even customize my order. Very pleased with being able to eat and work here. It has a great atmosphere with plenty of space. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I really like Paradise Bakery. The employees here are friendly and helpful. The food is good. I would give it 4 stars, but every time I come here, they are out of something that I want. So, there's that.
On my last visit, I had to use the restroom. I opened the door to the ladies room and heard gasps and had to start walking backwards because toilets were overflowing and I didn't want to get my feet wet with *that* kind of stuff."}
{"text":"What a great experience here! I stopped in one day for breakfast. They didn't have what I wanted, so I just bought a tea. The manager was so nice and didn't charge me for the tea, apologizing that they didn't have what I wanted.
So, I hadn't planned on going back, but because that manager treated me the way he did (there are a lot of homeless people in LV and I don't know that he could have distinguished me from anyone else, as I was on foot and dressed very casually), I would make it a point to go back. 
The next day, I went back for dinner with my traveling partner. They had a great deal on 99-cent pastries with the purchase of a meal - I believe a limited time promotion. But, we got great salads and pastries and tea and it was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Love their salads! I love that many Paneras have a kiosk where you can order your food - even customize it - and then go sit down and wait for it to come out to you.
The staff is always friendly. Very happy with dining here."}
{"text":"Panera as a company has really come a long way! First off, love that they have higher quality ingredients now (no artificial sweeteners, preservatives, etc). Other improvements from over the years:
-more vegetarian/vegan options (the bread bowls and strawberry poppyseed salad have become my favorites I've gone in for frequently).  
-delivery of food to your table, no more standing waiting for your buzzer to go off
-variety of non-soda drinks like their natural sweet teas in delicious flavors 

Only thing that's bugged me is multiple times (and at various locations) I order a salad without chicken and it still comes with chicken. Picking it off wouldn't ordinarily be a big deal but there are many little pieces that fall through to the bottom and are basically throughout the whole salad making it a constant pick while eating. I started politely sending them back after settling for it wrong once--too much work but hate to waste food since I'm sure they dump it. I know it's an unusual request to ask for no chicken/meat, and may just slip by kitchen staff, but better communication of special requests would be nice. All in all, I love Panera!"}
{"text":"I love Panera! Their food (everything, and I do mean everything) I taste is absolutely wonderful. I love their pumpkin muffies. The muffies are muffin tips with no body. Delicious! I love tyre fact that they have fountain green tea! Not a big fan of their lemonade though. If you have never gone to Panera you are truly missing out. GO NOW!"}
{"text":"I would've given a five star, but I feel there's room for improvement on the breakfast menu. There's not enough variety. I love Panera, and usually go there for lunch. Their lunch menu is very diverse. The Breakfast menu should be the same, or at least half as diverse as the lunch menu. Just my opinion. Anyway, I purchased an Asiago bagel (toasted), with roasted vegetable medley cream cheese. Very good! I had a cup of delicious Panera coffee that I made at home with it! Oh, the cashier that took my order was very friendly, and want afraid to smile! I love that! Well that's my 2 cents! Have a wonderful day!"}
{"text":"Just visited Panera and the staff is a most unfriendly bunch. (with the exception of one). No greetings when you come in and minimal interaction. I felt like I was a burden. The oatmeal was good and as ordered, the cinnamon bagel with walnut cream cheese, not so much. 20 minutes later and after we had to go up to the counter to ask. Again, no real concern from the manager or employee........an obligatory \"sorry about that\". Peace - not going back"}
{"text":"I signed up here before it opened for a rewards card, and man I love that thing! Free drink every day for 30 days! They have great tea, and this morning I had a breakfast sandwich that made my heart and soul happy. Give it a shot! Similar (maybe even same company) to Paradise, but food seemed better to me."}
{"text":"$9 for two bagels and 2 small coffees, expensive.  Cashier was a total miserable 'bad name'. What's worse Vaughan or woodbridge?? 
Horrible block-box stores and chaotic traffic.  Not a good location."}
{"text":"Great menu. Amazing hot chocolate cookies. Nice mango smoothie. Friendly staff... Only downside, EXPENSIVE!"}
{"text":"Went in for soup...soup was very tasty. Reason for low stars...the chicken noodle was,sll broth. .hardly anything inbit, had to go argue to get ingredients added.  For the money it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Omg disaster!!! Service: the cashier didn't hear 1/2 my order..I didn't look at receipt..it was busy I just swiped and sat. We are waiting for my mom's salad..not coming..when we realize it wasn't put in the order.  WE INTENTIONALLY came early to beat lunch rush..now there's a line and wait. UNACCEPTABLE!!!
FOOD: I ordered small bbq flatbread $5+.. tge cashier says would you rather do smaller flatbed and small soup..so I assumed it was a deal.. $9+.  The flatbread was dry like a cracker. .the chicken wasn't even warm..no cheese..I swear I think they forgot it!!! No onions.  Crammed w fresh spinach..the aim ingredient.  No bbq sauce..jad to ask for it on the side.
The chicken noodle soup had 2 noodles
.ingredients was ALL broth.  
Mom's food: fuji apple salad..loaded w huge chunks of red onion..the major ingredient next to lettuce.  Tge apples were dried chips not fresh..and big chunk of tomato. 
Terrible lunch...ingredients think the cook must be rushing. .ingredients know the cashier was!  Go elsewhere.  Cost over $16 and it sucked!!!!"}
{"text":"I have never been so surprised with continuous poor service. Not only from this location but several others in the valley. It seems like these poor employees have absolutely no coordination and can not modify an order for the life of them. Too bad since I have been a long time Paradise Bakery customer but since the switch to Panera something has gone down hill."}
{"text":"Stopped in for chocolate brownies around 830p...they were hard as rocks on the bottom.  Terrible after taste.  Not good bakery items."}
{"text":"I love Panera! I always go for brunch or lunch and even dinner on occasions. Today is the first time I'm trying breakfast. Very disappointed. I ordered a bacon and egg breakfast sandwich on a brioche bun and coffee for myself; a plain croissant and hot cocoa for my little one. When our order arrived, the breakfast sandwich did not look anything like the picture. The bun was toasted (panini-pressed) and was almost burned making it hard. And I didn't see any bacon! A crew member was walking by and I told her that there's no bacon. Her reply, \"Oh, it's inside.\" I opened the sandwich to inspect it - there was no bacon! I called the attention of the same crew member. Her reply this time, \"I'm sorry. We'll fix that for you.\" When she came back, I made sure my order was right this time. It was right alright. There was a piece of bacon, broken into three and carelessly placed on top of the \"scrambled\" egg. Too bad, I didn't take a picture. I could have made a better-looking sandwich for myself at home! For $4.89 +, I think it should have been better. Then there's the coffee. Went to get my second cup, and it was not hot! Almost room-temperature! And it's not even 10:00 AM yet! I informed a staff member at the register and she said she'll ask someone to make some. Granting this wasn't my usual location, but you would think all these places are held to the same Panera standard. The only saving grace was the crew being really nice and the cheese Danish that never fails.  Nevertheless, I'll give breakfast another chance but I think I'll stick to the soups and salads for the time being."}
{"text":"This is not a location I frequent, but was looking to get a quick bite and was already in the area. Ordered a \"pick two\" for my husband and I and a kid's meal and milk for my daughter. I always have water with my meals and inadvertently forgot to order a drink for my husband. Being that I had already paid and was still in line, I informed the girl at the counter that I would like to add a fountain drink to my order. She said it was alright and proceeded to hand me two plastic cups for the drinks. She basically gave it to me for free and I thought that was very nice of her. Thanked her and went to find a seat. Not long after, our orders came. I got a Fuji Apple Chicken Salad with a cup of tomato soup. Instead, they brought the tomato soup and what seemed like just salad greens. So I go back to the counter with salad on hand and inform the same girl that there must have been a mistake because I ordered a Fuji Apple Chicken Salad. A lady at the counter, turned out was the manager (this I found out later), said it was the salad I ordered - it was just \"the toppings were missing\": chicken, Fuji apple chips and pecans. I thought that was funny (not) - a Fuji Apple Chicken Salad without apples and chicken. Nevertheless, manager said she was going to bring it over. A freshly made salad came out, with manager personally bringing it and saying she wanted to make sure I get my order right. You'd think that was the end of it. But, no. I flagged down a staff member and informed him that my salad did not have chicken and this is the second time they made a mistake. He apologized and asked if I wanted a new one made. My reply, \"I don't know what you're supposed to do. I just want the salad I ordered.\" He took the salad and was back in no time. It was the same salad which they sprinkled with chicken on top. My husband asked to speak with a manager. She came to our table and immediately said that she yelled at everyone in the kitchen for the mistake. She said they \"check the food\" before it goes out to make sure it's right. My husband was like, \"It's just unbelievable that this could happen twice.\" She replies, \"I know, I know. That's why I yelled at everyone. We're sorry that this happened.\" She offered to give us a treat or some kind of pastry or even a free meal for all the trouble. I wasn't asking  for anything. All I wanted was my salad. I mean, how hard could that be? Someone in the kitchen is clearly not paying attention. Nevertheless, manager gave us the free meal and on our way out, I was going to bring the dishes to the station, she offered to do it for me. Truly appreciate that they tried to correct the mistake. I love Panera and I love the food but... maybe I'll stay away for awhile..."}
{"text":"Enjoy Panera's food and was super excited to see this location has a drive thru. The only downside is that the drive thru takes SO long.  I'm talking 10 minutes per car sometimes!  A suggestion would be to designate a place for cars to pull up to of the order is going to be awhile. Or tweak the workflow! Doesn't stop me from going though :)"}
{"text":"I was here the other day, because we were dying for some bread.

So...although tasty, I spent $18 on a half sandwich, a small salad and a lemonade.
That's uber pricey, for a non-artisan meal.

I had a half avocado BLT, and the bread was a little soft to hold onto all those toppings, so my sandwich came apart easily.

I had a summer strawberry salad with poppyseed dressing, that was also good, but the portion sizes leave much to be desired for the price.

It was only OK."}
{"text":"This is my fave Panera location in town. There's a lovely off-street bike path that leads here from across town. The staff is friendly & helpful. The bike parking is scant but available (so don't hog all the spaces).

Food offerings are typical Panera fare - sandwiches, salads, soups, coffee, etc. It's pretty standard across most Panera franchisees. What differentiates this location is that it's not as crowded as the one near the mall & it has normal hours when the university is NOT in session where the on-campus one closes often."}
{"text":"Crowded but convenient if you're on campus, this Panera offers just about what you'd expect: sandwiches, soups, salads, coffee, tea, bagels, bread, pastries. Generally, I like Panera but this location isn't the best for me. Also, shortened hours in the summer."}
{"text":"Love the bread and the French Onion Soup.
The Lemonade is delicious in the staff is always friendly.  Great lunch spot."}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience I ever had in my life there the person at the cash register just made me a smoothie that was lukewarm and gross it literally looked like some type of broth the smoothie had no thickness and she was rushing I know she was I'm gonna contact a manger next time I come here this is unacceptable I'm pissed"}
{"text":"Since this place was gradually taken over from paradise bakery to panera, it has just been ruined. The menu options have become more limited and many of the best items are just not even available anymore (Chinese chicken salad wrap). This new location is just plain awkward to get to, and the inside was freezing cold. The staff said the system wasn't working right but didn't seem sure how to adjust it. The staff were super nice though. Back to the food though, nowhere near where it used to be when it was paradise. Panera needs to go back to form, this new menu sucks."}
{"text":"Great service. Never had a problem with my previous orders. It's close to my home and it's at a convenient location. If I'm ever craving salad or soup or a sandwich, panera comes to mind!"}
{"text":"Well, I was excited to try this but not surprised at ALL by these reviews.  I've never been to another Panera, but heard it was good.

The line is always out the door at lunch time.  I didn't have to wait too long to get my order taken, but I had to wait about half an hour (that's my whole lunch break you guys) to get my salad.  I got a chicken cobb with avocado, it really should not have taken 30 minutes.  I wanted to leave and get my money back, but I was already out of time to go somewhere else and just had to wait it out.   Apparently I'm not the only one that was not going to wait -- there were two separate orders they kept calling out that had been abandoned. 

Anyway, I finally got my salad and had to run back.  Sadly my salad was not worth the wait.  None of the ingredients tasted fresh at all, the chicken was pre-cooked and dry, I got only 1/2 a small avocado and two very small cups of dressing.  The whole thing was just slapped together, looked awful, and was 99% lettuce.  Ended up throwing half of it away because it was just LETTUCE.

So food wasn't good, service wasn't good, and everyone in their \"kitchen\" was flying around like crazy people while at the same time not producing very many orders.  Saw two orders returned while I was standing in the little hallway.  I feel for the guys in the kitchen because they were busy and you've got people staring at you the whole time waiting for their food, but seriously they need to get it together."}
{"text":"Formerly a Paradise Bakery.  

Visited this location twice since the \"transformation\" from Paradise to Panera.  Ughhh.

First visit, placed a to-go order where we referenced a salad that Paradise offered.  Promptly, the spouse was advised that this is no longer Paradise \"we do not have a salad like that\". While I appreciate the re-branding effort, please don't chew me out.  I am customer - you are identity crisis,quick serve, fast food sit down, maze place that makes zero ergonomic sense.  

Second order - in person.  Paradise used the always moving order/prep line.  Panera uses the a customer funnel where you never really know who is next.  Place your order and turn 180 degrees to go get drinks/sit.  Hold please....remember the order funnel?  Yup, it is right behind you.  Commence the \"excuse me, pardon me, sorry I bumped you, can I get by\"?  Leaving the order line rivals waking the wrong way down a busy airport hallway.

Drinks!  One fountain inside of what feels like a butler pantry.  Four cash registers, one drink station.  Cool, I'm here, in the butler pantry awaiting my turn at the drink dispenser.  Yeah, you are gonna get up close and personal with the guy sipping his tea for 90 seconds as well as the person behind you who just finished a smoke.

Time to sit!  After you patiently smell and bump everyone in the drink pantry, use your phone's map to help you navigate to a table.  Careful, weird turn and a dead end.  The lay out is taken right from \"lab rate maze\" experiment kit starter kit.

Err, sorry for walking behind you, looking for a table will certainly be chanted by all who have manners.  Interior is laid out like the maze from the film \"The Shining.\"  If you figure out the maze, thank your cell phones maps and post some tips.

Food is on par with Paradise - on step above the Way of Subs or the Jersey of Mikes. 

The good news?  If you need to scream from frustration, the ergonomics of this place will provide you a catalyst for venting."}
{"text":"Called in over 15 phone orders - typically correct and ready to go.  - Lost a star for errors

Had breakfast here three weeks ago.  Food service time was greater than the time in a traditional sit down spot.  - Lost a star for this.

Price is acceptable.  Service is not bad.

As I type this I self realize that Paradise is a high end Subway.  New genre for food, mid-speed food?"}
{"text":"Panera vs. Paradise bakery.

Paradise wins from an ease of ordering standpoint.  Panera has an odd order taking system that prevents salads from being made in real time.

Quality and taste - this is a draw.  Very similar items, quality of ingredients similar.

Overall ease of use - Paradise wins.  Paradise provides a 16 oz (complimentary) cup for water.  Panera provides a dixie sized cup - think mouth wash sized.  Most Paradise have two  beverage dispensing stations.  Panera has one and the lines can move slowly.  The position of this locations beverage center is in one of the main isles - lots  of \"whoops\"  \"sorry\" and \"excuse me\" going on @ Panera.

Best of luck Panera."}
{"text":"Awful service & undercooked food, actually got a refund because I couldn't eat my meal. I haven't gone back since, the Panera in Avon is now my go-to."}
{"text":"After several negative lunchtime dining in experiences at the Panera Bread on Center Ridge Road in neighbor city Rocky River, I thought I would try the downtown Lakewood Panera Bread.
Hard to believe that this location is actually WORSE than the Center Ridge Road.
The whole place needs a good bath - dirty floors, dirty tables, dirty furniture fabric, dirty prep areas - disgusting!
How come the Lakewood Health Dept. hasn't cited this location?
Staff seem clueless, not customer friendly, and not very happy. The cashier made multiple errors on my order, so that a \"manager\" had to come over and correct them. The food prep area was beyond dirty - food scraps all over the counters and floor, bread not covered, a couple flies enjoying a free lunch around the lettuce storage area. Can I say really gross!
This location makes the not great Rocky River location appear Michelin Star ready!
Is there no regional management of these two Panera Bread locations? Doesn't Panera Bread understand what just happened to Chipotle with dirty restaurants and under-trained staff?
Where is the District Manager's supervision of these 2 locations?
And where is the Lakewood Health Dept. inspection?"}
{"text":"Well, what can one say - dirty food prep area, young employees who don't seem to really know much about the menu or customer service. Tables in dining area left dirty. I sat at a table while I ate lunch and then worked a bit on my laptop. For two hours - midday - not one employee came out to clear/clean many tables. Truly unacceptable. Where is the management at this Panera? Where is the District Manager at this Panera? For now, I'm going to take my lunch time business somewhere on Center Ridge Road. Just not worth the hassles at this Panera location."}
{"text":"Fabulous PLace!! Great Food and the employees here are always so freindly.  They even offer my kids a complimentary cookie sometimes.  Keep up the great work Panera!"}
{"text":"This is the closest paradise bakery to house and have been here many times. There are only a couple of the employees who are nice the rest are just there for a paycheck. It doesn't matter what time of day you go in or how many people are in line you will wait because the service is awful! There have been times I have been there and employees have just left their stations and none of their employees have a clue where they are. My son wanted a cookie cake for his birthday I called and spoke with a manager who confirmed what it was supposed to say and the colors. I arrived at the scheduled pick up time and the cake was not ready because they didn't know what to write on it. Are you kidding? When I am spending so much on a salad it should at least be full of lettuce but that is never the case. The blonde manager is a joke and can't control anything and never has a clue of what's going on. If the one at 67th Ave and the 101 wasn't so far I would go there. They are always nicer and on top of their game!"}
{"text":"As soon as the door, opened, we were greeted!  I wanted to try there sopa bowl!  I'm not a big fan of Panera bread.  So I got up to the register ASAP!  It was Easter Sunday!  So I ordered it with chicken to go!  I got home, and it had some french bread with it.  It was good!  But not sure if I will be back!  I didn't expect it to cost $9 and some change!  So to me it was good, but was it that good!  Naw!  I'm good!  But it's the best thing I've ever had at Panera Bread!"}
{"text":"I love Panera in general, and this location is great.  Food is fresh and tasty, service is reliable, people are friendly.  The nutritional aspects of Panera food are excellent."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Panera Bread for more than a decade. It's truly healthy and delicious. I love the variety of options and the You Pick Two offer is great for people like me who like variety in their meals. 

Favorite dishes: French Onion Soup, Tomato Basil Soup, Chicken Salad Sandwich, Tuna Sandwich."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot for healthy lite meals. I discovered his restaurant after a friend suggested we meet here for lunch during the work week. It was very busy and seemed to be very popular."}
{"text":"WiFi seems to inexplicably ban access to some games. Tea selection is limited.

Despite this, the staff is very courteous and helpful."}
{"text":"Went there for a cookie in the afternoon, although the place was nice and clean, the stuff was friendly, but the cookie (Chocolate Duet with Walnuts) was way too sweet. I was just curious, checked on their website, there is 36g of sugar in this little, innocent cookie!!!! Won't go there again!!"}
{"text":"Lunch pick 2 for me and the wife order taken by mike.....Panera is Like Burger King, McDonalds or any other food chain, you get what you expect and nothing fancy, standard Soups, and Sandwich, want to try the Soba Bowls but can not imagine it would be better than a a true Pho.
I will keep coming back because the wife likes it but it is never special in anyway shape or form.
But consistently decent or as the review sex A-Ok!"}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwiches are delicious - quick way to eat before church. The parking here is terrible but the food is good. I haven't used the Rapid pick up service but with the way parking is, it won't be rapid.

I like the cheddar broccoli soup with the grilled cheese sandwich (add mayo, lettuce and avocado). The agave tea is tasty and the only thing I drink while there.

Customer service is always good - could be better but not as bad as some other Panera locations I've visited."}
{"text":"First time ever trying Panera bread. Was pretty good. I had half of a Strawberry poppyseed w/ chicken salad and half a roasted Turkey Apple and cheddar sandwich. The salad was ok. The chicken had a strong seasoning on it I didn't care for. The sandwich was real good except the arugula was tuff. All in all not a bad experience."}
{"text":"I have never been to this panera before an I was in The area,  I orderd the turkey apple an cheddar  an autumn squash soup,  I started eating my sandwich an our came a long strand of hair, ( not mine)
I about gagged , manager did  offer to make a new one  but I was already nauseated,  he told me sometimes it happens , Wow Really ...
So then instead  of giving me money back like I requested, have me a bagel an cream cheese...ugh needless to say I didn't even finish my soup.
Too disgusted!"}
{"text":"I was hoping this location would improve once it switched from Paradise Bakery to Panera, but thus far I have been disappointed.

Pros:
Convenient/Quick
Reasonable prices
Good sourdough bread

Cons:
Several times they have been out of menu items with no explanation
Food was only ok; edible but I can make better (and I don't really cook)"}
{"text":"The parking is always rough, but the tomato soup is worth it. That paired with a half a sandwich or salad and I'm a happy camper. I have always found it funny that you get a choice of an apple or bread as a side. Especially when got order a sandwich. Some of the food is too dog for me, but I do enjoy their baked goodies!"}
{"text":"Thank you to Contesa who made our whole day better by fixing my best friends sandwich! You deserve a raise!"}
{"text":"My kids love this place...pretty consistent.
I have had a few problems with to go orders not being right.
Over all we like the menu choices and you can eat pretty healthy for a good price."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Panera for years. This place recently opened near my house and I've used the drive thru a few times. Today I ordered soup in a bread bowl and a chocolate chip cookie. 

On the way home I decided to eat the warm cookie. Much to my dismay is included a special treat....

A LONG DARK HAIR! 

GROSS!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, good healthy choices to choose from.  You got to try their smoothies, tum delicious and healthy...."}
{"text":"Our house loves Paradise Bakery but over the years we've found out that they aren't that consistent with their food. We go to two locations either this one or the one in Chandler Fashion Center. We've found out that the ones in the malls just don't have the exceptional food like the ones that are outside of the malls. 

If you grab the paradise pasta salad from the mall even though it's good they don't put the added touch of shredded cheese on the salad BUT if you go to a store that's not in the mall they add shredded cheese on top of the paradise salad which all in all makes it better. I just wish that their food was the same from location to location."}
{"text":"This comment applies across the board to all Panera locations:

Get the accountants out of the kitchen!  Your \"portion-control\" efforts, (food cost containment) makes your serving size pathetic. Had a catering order delivered with all sandwiches having only small shreds of meat.  No pretext to cover the bread. It is little wonder Capriottis is kicking your butts!  I won't repeat the mistake of ordering from you...it was embarrassing!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly and timely while stopping in to get a few bagels and coffee as a road trip snack due to missing breakfast that morning.  That's about all you can ask for from a chain restaurant/fast casual. 

If the food is prepared to standard, you can't expect anything else.  No chain will go above and beyond with quality over what they have to do - that's why it is a chain."}
{"text":"This is a good Panera bread location. They are near my work and quick in and out. Not too much traffic. I really enjoyed the salad here. Their prices seem good for a non-fast food meal."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich no flavor ... Very bad.  Smoothie was good - coffee is good and pecan roll was good"}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin. I placed an order and waited over 20 minutes for two egg sandwiches to go. It seemed a little chaotic so I asked the manager, who was standing at the window, if my order was correct. He assured me it was. I got out to the car and nope, not correct
Went back inside and explained situation. He said he was making me a new sandwich immediately. Well he started to and then walked away and did something else. After waiting for 15 minutes for replacement, I mentioned to the manager I had been there over 30 minutes and he said \"oh ok\" then he offered me 6 free bagels. Super nice gesture. He handed me a bag (assuming it was the free bagels). I waited another 5 minutes for my sandwich. When I got to the car, my sandwich was still wrong and with the bagels, was someone else's to go order...didn't notice til after we had driven away. Sheet confusion and chaos"}
{"text":"I frequent this place for my pick up orders and it's quick and tasty every time.

I usually call ahead for their pick two combo with a Thai chicken salad and either the black bean or garden vegetable with pesto soup. Served with chips, apple or bread it's less than $10 and a full meal at a great value. 

I love the salad, they always make sure to put the dressing on the side and everything is packaged nice and neat. 

The cashiers are always friendly and my food is always ready right when I get there. 

I'm happy with Panera and I'm lucky it's close enough for fresh salads and soups when I'm looking for something quick."}
{"text":"I love this Panera.  It is one of my favorites and the husband and I only like going to this one as their food is always fresh.  This location has also started the new system of delivering food to you, which is nice not having to wait at the pick up counter any more and wondering if it's your food or not that's out.  Great place and location.

The only negative is that trash seems to pile up a bit.  As in the plates and bowls and trays tend to over flow and is not a pretty sight.  Also the staff can use a personality injection at times.  Or just smile.  I know it sucks to be in the food service industry but please don't make me want to leave because you are being a negative nancy."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this Panera's food.  It didn't taste fresh, it tasted stale and was at mild temperatures.  I ordered the Soba Noodle and Shrimp salad and nothing tasted right and shortly after eating, I became sick.

The staff here are nice and friendly but I wouldn't eat their food."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere. I've dined in and have ordered delivery from this location. Constantly nasty! Tonight was the last straw ordered the chicken tortellini alfredo with a bacon turkey bravo for delivery. For starters Panera robs you blind when you order delivery. They charge you the same exact price as dining in but give you  significantly smaller portions. I've ordered soups that don't even half way fill the bread bowl, but at the restaurant it's nearly spilling over. As for my order tonight, I received an email saying my food had arrived went downstairs and opened the door saw the driver at the end of our driveway inside her car. Waited a minute for her to bring the food, few minutes go by and nothing. Figured she was collecting herself stepped away to grab a drink. Few minutes later I go back to the door still nothing. I give up. I walked out in the rain to the car. The driver was incredibly rude and on her phone. Took the food and went on my way. The  tortellini was extremely crunchy and dry in the middle not to mention it was cold. The sandwich was meh at best. I don't expect this kind of service especially not when I'm paying nearly $20 for food including a tip for the ungrateful driver. Never again."}
{"text":"This is our first time going to Panera and will definitely be our last!!! My husband wine to pick up lunch for us and a staff member at my company. We open up our bag and my Asiago Steak Sandwich is just 1/2 instead of a whole and guess what.....it has no freaking steak in it AT ALL!!! Who makes a sandwich and forgets to put in the main ingredient???? That's 2 strikes. Then they completely forget my staff member's Roasted Turkey BLT sandwich...but they sure did charge us for it!!! The worst restaurant ever!!! If I could give negative stars I would.



I would like to update:

The manager was very sympathetic about the inconvenience of having to come back and our order completely wrong. He was refunded in full. They were kind to offer pastries but my husband declined. He only wanted the order to be done correctly."}
{"text":"The employees are super sweet and the strawberry poppy seed salad is amaazzzing."}
{"text":"I have mild issues with the Panera Bread chain (they advertise healthy and fresh, but not all of their food is), but will occasionally visit.  This location was a notch below most.   Service was a bit slow and dysfunctional - got my takeout order wrong.  It was sad watching them prepare my soup from a bag and heating it.  Taste of most of the items was ok.  There are other places nearby that offer truly fresh, non processed fare superior to this."}
{"text":"Good location on Tiedeman.  Was a little disappointed when I ordered a flatbread and did not find out until after I paid they had no flatbread and they made the sandwich on another bread that was not as good.  Ingredients fresh, drinks are good, soups are good.  Good choice to stop for lunch or a late bite."}
{"text":"I love the food and coffee but the staff needs to trained in customer service. As I walked up to the counter, two order takers walked away."}
{"text":"Coming from only knowing Panera in California I was super bummed till I found out about paradise! I love that it's the same way and the staff are fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is always a zoo! Sooo busy! Large lines and all tables are usually taken. Highly recommend to do the rapid pick up online. You pay online and just pick up your food from the shelves. It's quick and you can choose to eat there or take it with you. 

I got the pick two with vegetable soup and Thai chicken salad. The vegetable soup was good but taste more like a minestrone. I didn't care for the salad. The vegetables had a weird vinegar taste. I have had other things on the menu and the food is pretty bland. I miss paradise bakery. I thought the quality was a lot better.  The one thing I actually love is their teas. The mango black tea is really refreshing. 

I would say to skip this place and go to another option. Not worth the money and chaos."}
{"text":"Good food. Nice selection of sandwiches, salad, drinks and bakery. Fast lunchtime service. But who doesn't already know what Panera's is like!?"}
{"text":"This place is very spacious! Wifi connection of course also features an upstairs and they bring your food to you.
This location was super convenient and right downtown. I like this location because it's convenient."}
{"text":"The food is delicious from the sandwiches, salads, soups and baked goods I have never had something I didn't enjoy. Great selection of unsweetened ice teas too.

Paradise Bakery gets four stars for the food, but loses a star for the price and ordering system.  Today I got a whole classic salad add chicken and a large drink, it was over $12. It was delicious in spite of the southwest chicken salad being removed from the menu resulting in roasted corn & peppers not being available (argh).

As for the ordering system, they really need to figure out how to remove the inevitable first timer confusion and worker needing to explain repeatedly where to order what from.

There is typically a line greeting you when you come anytime around lunch. Today I took food to go and it took 17 minutes."}
{"text":"Sad to see an inferior outfit buyout Paradise Bakery. Food isn't really different but the service model of Panera is lousy relative to Paradise. I have never gotten my food exactly the way I ordered it because the interaction between customers and food preparers is gone. Also, the fact Panera has made zero effort to integrate the Paradise reward points does not help my loyalty. I'll still drop in for a cookie, but plan to find a new place for salads. 

***update

I retract my statement regarding food being essentially the same. Paradise had an outstanding club sandwich on a croissant roll that Panera has not continued. Also, the cookies are not as good. They're more like grocery store cookies than Paradise's. This seems odd to me as I was informed that Panera uses the same dough as the remaining Paradise stores... The texture is markedly different though."}
{"text":"I am a Panera rewards member . In the past I have been to this Panera plenty of times . This time , they were really backed up with orders . It was 1 30 in the afternoon and not one person at the front counter . After waiting for a few minutes one guy came to take my order . He seems to rush me placing my order . . The only table I could find was dirty . Over all it just seemed unorganized . Many people standing around waiting for their orders ."}
{"text":"I do have to say, this location is kinda annoying to get to considering there is no direct way getting in. You have to go through the mall basically to get here and the parking is so so limited, especially around lunch.

I know that's not their fault, but the developers fault about the parking. 

The employees are really nice here, they give great recommendations when I am confused on what to get and they take their time when you're ordering and trying to decide. 

I'm obsessed with the Green Goddess Salad"}
{"text":"This Panera is solidly what I expect from Panera. The food is consistently good and the restaurant is clean. Easy parking and friendly service.

The only downside to this Panera location is that it is EXTREMELY busy in the morning on weekdays and often busy at other times. Unfortunately, they haven't quite mastered moving the line during peak hours. 

If you're getting it to go, use their Rapid Pickup service for a quick in and out. I live a few blocks away and have ordered from my driveway on my smart phone which makes for a less than 5 min stop during busy mornings - and 3 min are spent filling my coffee cup...because mornings. My order has always been on the shelf by the time I arrive (before the guaranteed time) and there are 2 parking spots up front dedicated to Rapid Pickup."}
{"text":"This location moves very SLOW. Regardless of time of day, you'll wait a while for room temperature food. You'll ALWAYS be missing food, guaranteed with that one. Seriously, I could bet money on it. Sauce, topping, etc. you'll always have to go up and ask for it. They're sometimes better with pickup but this recent time I was waiting 10min after my pick up time. Our food was finally ready and we looked in the bag and we're missing a muffie. My husband asked why wasn't it in there, and the woman was just like \"because we don't have anymore.\"  Okay...understandable, but no one ever told us that until we asked. He finally asked if he could have something else. Like HELLO! We just paid for it like why are we even having this convo?! They're petty workers, laughing at mad customers in the back, manager is cold. Get it together, dang."}
{"text":"Great spot for meetings. The wifi is great and power is close by. The tea is great!  They have many flavors that are all freshly brewed. Food is great! It's a little over priced in my opinion, but it's good stuff. The club sand which is great and the snicker doodle cookie is legit.   Definitely worth stopping by."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Healthy food, they measure food out unlike most restaurants! No MSG or  preservatives in most of their food. I am so glad this is in the west valley please don't let the negative reviews keep you from visiting."}
{"text":"Jessiah was super nice, thank you for serving with a smile. I do wish that the autumn squash soup was dairy free/vegan. The salad was good and it was easy to substitute the chicken for a cruelty free option of avocado. Service is great and it is a clean restaurant with a nice patio to sit on."}
{"text":"Healthy food and tons of options. Absolutely love this place I am vegan and they manage to make the sesame chicken salad without chicken and the Mediterranean veggie sandwich without any dairy. My father had the French onion soup and the steak and cheese sandwich he said it was very good. My mother had the quinoa salad and said it was fabulous! I'm so happy that Panera I took over paradise. You can even order from the tables on your cell phone or from tablets on the front no human contact needed. Once you're finished ordering you bring your buzzer back to the table place it on the allotted space and the waiter come straight to you"}
{"text":"Holy yummy fresh food! Unfortunately it seems they have no Vegan soups. Would love to see the autumn squash soup without the cream. I do wish the salads came without animals protein or there was a vegan choice. Also vegans beware you cant get a dairy free pastry on your birthday"}
{"text":"I have been there three times since the change. Food was okay but every time they are out of something???  Dining room cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired. They better get it together soon or I'll be going elsewhere"}
{"text":"I've spent a lot of money here on orders I take to my clients.  A couple weeks ago I had an order from this location delivered to one of my clients for a meeting and they were 1 hour and 45 minutes late delivering it.  I don't think it was the driver's fault because when I called twice the driver still had not left yet because \"they were overwhelmed with orders...\"  Then don't commit to delivering an order at a certain time if you cannot do it.  I felt sorry for the driver.  And when I go there for meetings or to get work done, there is this one manager (I'm assuming she's a manager because she wears plain clothes and runs around the store like she owns the place) with blonde hair who shouts her business like there's no tomorrow.  It's quite obnoxious.  The one day I was sitting in the booth eating my sandwich and she was flipping out that her daughter was in a minor car accident.  I mean she was truly yelling into her phone.  I get that it was an emergency situation, but either take your call in the back or leave your store.  I see her now and then when I'm in there and she's beyond obnoxious.  I gave this place 2 stars because some of the workers are very nice and do a good job making food and bagels.  They also have good lattes."}
{"text":"I am from out of town and am I big fan of Panera's all over when I would like a quick breakfast spot to go to. They do not have cream cheese here for your bagels and by the time I received my bagel it was already cold. Looks like Paradise/Panera needs a bit more work to fully transition."}
{"text":"The good things about Panera was the service and the soup. The cheddar broccoli and the bread that comes with it were pretty good. I wouldn't go out of my way to go for their soup but It would still be an option. Servers were friendly and kept up cleaning tables for the crowded lunch.
I had the BLT with avacado. The B was for bland. The sandwich had no flavors and the bacon was non existent, very underwhelming. Too many other sandwich shops with better food than coming back here."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here lately, since working from home all the time becomes claustrophobic. Much better than local Starbucks..."}
{"text":"This is all you would expect from a Panera Bread. Easy ordering. Good sandwiches, salads and bakery treats. Not to mention good coffee. 

I go in expecting what I always do, but sometimes I need more than food and drink. There is wifi, which is always reliable. But there are no power outlets. Which prevents me from getting some work done.

I was there today, but had to leave without giving them any business because there are only two outlets in the whole place

More outlets please. That's the only reason I gave 4 instead of five stars."}
{"text":"My issue is with the service, not the food we received.   We stopped in last night to pick up some muffins and pastries to have for breakfast.   We went right to the counter where the pastries are while the cashier stayed at the register.   Did not offer any assistance until we asked.   We ordered three pumpkin muffins and two pecan rolls.  Didn't notice how she packaged them until we got home and opened the bag.   Three muffins thrown in the bottom of the bag, unwrapped, and two boxes of rolls on top of the muffins.   Although not absolutely necessary, a smile and a thanks from the cashier would have been appreciated.  When we pulled out of the parking lot, we noticed that she was resting her head on the register.   Perhaps she was tired or not feeling well.   If so, management should have sent her home."}
{"text":"I've frequented this Panera several times over the years, and it's the same story every time: dirty restaurant, crude employees, and typically out of the more popular items. Panera is very expensive for the experience; drop $15 on a \"you pick two\" combo (since a half sandwich is $5 and a cup of cold soup is $5, a drink is another $2 I think) and still walk out hungry.

It seems that there are more available seats here than in Cranberry Twp or in Monaca. It appears that Cranberry Twp has more seats in total, but they fill up less briskly in Wexford.

I will say, though, that this Panera is better than the ones in Monaca, Cranberry Twp, and Butler about keeping baked goods in stock, bur still fall short of my expectations."}
{"text":"Pretty poor service here - no wonder they're being replaced by iPads.

Came in around 10:30 and the coffee was emptied. Informed a young employee and she rolled her eyes at me and snapped \"I'm aware\" and stormed away. Didn't get coffee for about 15 minutes, there was a very annoyed crowd. A gentleman let the manager know about the situation. 

Not impressed."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Free Internet but connectivity is sporadic at times and capable bandwidth is limited due to non-trunking, cheap service.
Sandwiches are above-average priced for a below average portion/sandwich-content.
Customer Service is top level, in the industry."}
{"text":"I'm giving this review two starts and only because I love the food. Been to this location several times and always encounter the same problem. SLOW SERVICE! Last time I came in ordered I waited for 20 minutes. This time I'd thought I'd call to speed up the process and ended up waiting another 15 minutes and my order was not complete. I don't understand the system they having going on there but it definitely needs improvement. Will go to one on Bell next time :/"}
{"text":"Ordered the soup and sandwich combo
Chicken soup and turkey and cheddar and apple
Both very good soup a little salty but I like it that way
Turkey sandwich was very good however the turkey was in big chunks and kept falling out of bread
Think they could have put sandwich together better or at least served it with a fork
Girl who delivered food was very Pleasant as were the girls that took my order
Will return"}
{"text":"Yesterday I asked for a plain bagel with butter
And then I asked that it be cut in quarters 
Well it was cut in quarters alright but just put in 
the bag no wrappings just open in the bag
Strange!
One star rating for yesterday however other than that they deserve at least 4 stars

Today deserves 0 stars 
Asked for chips got bread
Girls in back having good old time
Looking in bag but not checking receipt
They have a large captive clientele and should do a better job
One of cashiers doesn't even smile when taking orders
Management needs to retrain all of staff
If they don't shape up will lose a lot of business"}
{"text":"I have to say that the prices are outrageous!! For a plain turkey sandwich it was almost $8! For a cup of chicken noodle soup that I can buy in a can is almost $5! Food is mediocre. Not going back!"}
{"text":"What a load of old bollocks, the most schizophrenic place, menu and staff I have experienced since living in Canada, the portions are overpriced and underweight and most of the tweeky numpties working there don't know their elbows from their arseholes.

I walk in and order, then get told to walk to the back, which resembles a waiting room for the imminently underwhelmed.  The woman behind the counter calls my name, so im thinking 'nice one this is quick', only for her to tell me they've run out of half my stuff, I try to pick an alternative only to be told my choice has to be the same or similar to what I had ordered.  So I stand there and give her a verbal dressing down about customer service and learning her trade and all that, and she gets all twatty and then decides to back down.  I get my order, and the sandwich is half the size of a slider and consists mainly of soggy tomato and crippled lettuce, there's some sort of protein in there, but it looks like something dragged out of a gladiatorial arena after a days savagery, so no joy there.  The salad I had was boredom in physical form and no drink included, that's another $400 or something.

This place is really really really really really really crap, soup/salad/sandwich places generally are, but this pace wins the Oscar for lead performer in a pooh sandwich role, just awful."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant, very clean, modern design. Seems like the future. We are both vegans and were disappointed the Sobo noodle dish wasn't vegan. It indicated it was vegetarian and the ingredients seemed vegan. We ended up with the kale, lentil dish and ordered a French baguette. Found out the baguette wasn't vegan.... \"none of our bread is vegan\". Why NOT!?!?!  Won't be going back! The dish we ordered was tasty enough, but we were hungry in an hour. I'd rather go across the street to Chipotle or to Pei Wei and get a belly full of plant goodness. My body isn't a graveyard."}
{"text":"Vegans beware... They were only one or two choices for a sandwich here. I would love to see this location branch out a bit to accommodate the vegan community in regards to bread soups and pastries. As far as I'm aware there was only one bread from Panera that vegans can eat.

This place has amazing cookies and pastries and soups and sandwiches!! I've eaten at Panera's several times prior to me going vegan... And I have never been disappointed. However since going vegan I find Panera a bit of a challenge to eat at. The staff is always really friendly and they're always trying really hard to help me find something that I can eat, that's not a salad... so they get points for that! 

The parking here super easy the location is always very very clean and the staff is always nice! It seems as though there's plenty of space for even a large group to enjoy. It seems as though there's plenty of space for even a large group to enjoy.

If you're not a vegan and you want to sit down for lunch or take it to go this is going to be a great option for you! If you are vegan be sure to have a little extra time to discuss what you're looking for in a veggie sandwich, so you get something you can eat. The one I ordered was hot and delicious... Just not very much in the way of choices."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have ordered soup after 8pm and all of the soup containers are in plastic bags. As a cancer survivor I am pretty sure this is not a good idea. Hot plastic with soup? Anyway, it appears this is probably done when they get close to closing so they don't need to clean the stainless containers. Also, I think cleaning the restaurant while people are still eating is unprofessional."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Took five minutes for a sugar cookie when there was no line. First I tried to get an employees attention, which failed. I then ordered at one of their kiosks, to no avail. Finally got someone to give me a sugar cookie. Also, even though it's summer there were no lemon cookies."}
{"text":"I love Panera, I don't know what's taken me so long to write a review but there food is good and healthy. My fave thing on the menu is green tea, Fuji apple with chicken salad, & Frontega chicken panini is AMAZING. Also there macaroni and cheese is so creamy it's amazing. It's super clean and extremely nice and helpful staffs. I love how interactive they are and how polite they all are. There's still so many other things I want to try at Panera but I keep getting my favorite salad there lol. This place is a must try if you hadn't tried it their soup is super good too but I just stick to what I always get!"}
{"text":"Dirty. If you ever plan on eating here, walk through the dining area & look at the floors. I swore up and down that I wouldn't return, but the manager seemed very sincere. He insisted that I had just missed a busy rush and they hadn't been able to catch up on the dining area. Just walk in with open eyes. Under every single table, there's a substantial mess. I'm not talking about just crumbs, but whole chunks of meat, pieces of lettuce, spilled soup... The tile isn't any better. Some areas were sticky where others showed obvious spill outlines of dirt and dust. Either the people who eat at Panera are the filthiest eaters on the planet or the staff just doesn't care. It's easy to dismiss a little mess as the result of some lunch/dinner rush, but if you look closer, you will see an obvious apathy towards cleanliness that is only addressed at the close of business.

While we, as adults, know better, it is not uncommon for a toddler to explore his surroundings as mine did. Unfortunately, there is a one inch gap between the seat and the wall. This design flaw leaves a perfect hiding place for dropped food. A diligent restaurant would recognize this and clean such a space often. This restaurant failed to do this. As a result, I spent Father's Day eve caring for my son who spent the night throwing up everything. I've been to a good number of restaurants with this same gap and yet, Ive never had to worry about it not being clean. Absolutely disgusting. 

And if you still decide to brave the squalor of the dining room, do not order the brownie. They look beautiful, but have the consistency of adobe. My BBQ chicken salad was good as was the wife's sandwich/soup. It's a shame they don't take more pride in their dining area."}
{"text":"Checked out this location while in the Concord Mills area and it just so happened they have renovated. The biggest change I would say is that now bakery window spans across the front of the registers. The colors are lighter as well and the lighting has changed making it seem very bright and airy inside.  The self check out kiosks (tablets) are still available.

My favorite menu item these days is the Roasted Turkey, Apple, and Cheddar sandwich. It's has great texture with soft cranberry walnut bread and crunchy apple slices and apple slaw. Panera of course has the best cookies, muffins and teas."}
{"text":"This Panera Bread location is the closest to my job, so I frequent it quite a bit. This is located near Whitehall Business Park/South Tryon. This location does not have a drive thru, but it does have rapid pick up and delivery services ( even on individual orders). I cannot recall a time I use rapid pickup and my order was incorrect. I also cannot remember a time at this location when the staff was rude; this is a very mature team , that understands what customer service is and how to communicate with people. This is definitely a preferred Panera Bread location for me."}
{"text":"I can be a picky chooser but everything here is soo yummy. Sometimes it get's hard to choose but if you're craving pasta, delicious salads, handcrafted sandwiches or bread and only have about less than an hour to spare, Panera is the place to go. It's classy, very clean, staff friendly and delicious. 

Also a place where you can study, hang out with friends, host a meeting etc. Definately a place I'll be going as long as there's one open."}
{"text":"This store has the best cinnamon rolls ever!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place and the staff has always been friendly. Managers are actually knowledgeable. They also check in with you to make sure your meal was to be expected."}
{"text":"Rude and dirty 
Most of the tables were too dirty to sit. The soup was a watered version of better soups at different paneras. Even the manager made a rude comment toward me!!! Will never be back to this location"}
{"text":"So happy we finally got a location near by. And the best of this location is the drive thru. Love everything in their menu, don't remember anything I haven't like.  I get free drinks very often with my rewards card, but then I eat here very often as well. One con is sometimes drive thru is not as efficient as it should. They've mess up my order a couple of times."}
{"text":"I am an avid fan of this place and whenever I have the time and money to make a visit day or night I will make sure to visit and have my usual \"turkey bacon avocado sandwich, combined with clam chowder soup and a variety of naturally brewed ice teas!"}
{"text":"Decent food but place was dirty and bathrooms not clean but food and people made up for it"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their Lil bakery! The salads are probably  my favorite around compared to some of the other fast salad places. I enjoy there sitting area too, comfortable and quiet. The service  has always been good and fast!"}
{"text":"For a chain...not bad. Had clam chowder in a bread bowl and partner had small bowl of autumn squash soup and the Greek quinoa salad.  

We were given the options of sides...roll, baguette, fruit cup and what we thought we heard was \"apple chips\".  We laughed when we were brought two whole apples and realized the option was apple or chips! 

Both meals were fine and with our gift card cost us a whopping $1.18 plus we left a couple of bucks for a tip."}
{"text":"You have to try the App ! Rapid pick up is the way to go - their food is so fresh and their salads are just amazing. I usually have their oatmeal and during lunch time  I have the YOU PICK 2 ! The tomato soup is delicious with my steak and cheddar panini. Thank you Panera for giving healthy options."}
{"text":"We go to panera regularly as my son loves their mac and cheese. The service has been getting worse and worse with time. I have ordered turkey salad and then it has come to my table missing the turkey. Ordered apple fuji salad and got it without the apples. 
Yesterday was the last time we go there. Service was horrible. I asked very patiently to the waiter if he knew if the coffee was coming out soon and he raised his tone at me! Same waiter has been rude to my son once he had a cough. 
So definitely we gave them a chance and it just keep on getting worse. Not worth it. Rather take my son for mac and cheese somewhere else.
Food isnt cheap, service is gross 
No need to support their business"}
{"text":"A lot of people didn't know this was a chain from just south of the boarder. I've been to a few in Houston and the one in Richmond Hill is laid out identically. The breads are baked fresh daily, their cookies and pastries are delicious, and the sandwiches are a decent size. Problem is, everything is just a tad expensive for what you get. There's lots of sun and free wi-fi. This is a good place to drop by and have lunch, I just wouldn't go out of my way to go here.

Overall, the chain remains consistent and keeps to its promise of fresh breads and delicious baked goods. The prices are slightly higher than you would expect and the sandwiches don't seem worth the price. Come for a cookie (or five) and the wi-fi."}
{"text":"I love Panera and have always had a great experience at other location. This location is NOT ALLERGY FRIENDLY! I ordered the oatmeal with blueberries and granola, asked if it had nuts, and was told that it has almonds. I said I'd be happy to order something else because I cannot eat nuts and the cashier assured me that it could be ordered without added nuts. I picked up my bowl of oatmeal, and it was covered with pecans. The cooks behind the counter were unfriendly when I took it back but did make me a different version. I much prefer the service at the Willoughby location."}
{"text":"Food is great...when they have it. They are always \"out\" of everything!! Egg soufflés, bread bowls, cinnamon crunch bagels....they never have them. I can always just drive up to the Concord location which is MORE busy yet they always have what I want."}
{"text":"I went there this morning at 10:29. I asked to order a breakfast sandwich. The sign for breakfast was still in front of her register, as I asked her for the sandwich that was advertised. The girl that was taking my order very rudely turn the sign over and said sorry we're no longer serving breakfast. So I ordered a bagel instead. She then told the girl next to her to change her sign as well, as breakfast was over. I ignored it and went to go pick up my order and I asked the other girl giving me my bagel what time is breakfast stop serving at? And she said we stopped at 10:30. Really you couldn't give me a sandwich because it was right on the DOT? Horrible service rude people wouldn't suggest this location"}
{"text":"I'm a fan. They've got great customer service, great food, and free wireless. You can set up camp for 5 hours, and nobody will bother you a bit. 

My favorite are location is the one off Providence, at that nightmare intersection of Providence and Providence and Queens and Queens. The staff is friendly, and the service is fast. 

Right now, the roasted tomato panini is magical. There's a great tomato soup that is good with it as well. I think it's a little stupid that they give you a side of bread to go with your bread sandwiches, but that's ok. I spring for the apple when they remember to ask. 

One of the most recent times I was there, the lady at the cash register gave me a cookie for free because it broke when she went to pick it up. That's the best...the cookie totally didn't taste broken at all! Hah!"}
{"text":"I really like Panera, but like Amy R, I've had a bad experience with this location. The service strikes me as being ill-equipped to deal with the crowds, and they can get a little fussy about any requests that are slightly out of the ordinary. For instance, I had a teabag in my coffee cup the last time I was in there, and I asked if I could get some hot water. The woman behind the counter really, really didn't want to get me hot water, and then she charged me the same price as she would have for tea. It was pretty lame.

That said, I have business in that area of town, so I kind of find myself drawn to the yummy sandwiches and free wireless."}
{"text":"I give this Panera a complete zero rating. Stay away from this store. I think the cashier was high, couldn't get our order straight and then put it under the wrong name. Oh and by the way they ran out of coffee but didn't bother telling us until they all ready charged us. Unbelievably bad service. Stay away from this place. Go to the Starbucks down the street."}
{"text":"For a nearly empty restaurant, it lacks a lot.   Had to remind server to bring all our food we paid for.  Food arrived and husband 'so sandwich was wrong."}
{"text":"It's funny that they have BREAD in the title because bread is hardly what this place makes me think of.   Instead I think of it as Panera Sandwich Company.  Nothing exciting about the bread.  I used to eat here quite a bit.  The sandwich quality has gone downhill.  The value for the dollar we think is a bit out of proportion.  We don't like the \"wait your own table\" set up.  We have never had a good cup of coffee here.  The bakery has always been just so-so.   Recently they were somewhat disorganized and weren't able to fill some of our order at the time. 
Their patio is nice with a nice view but rather small.  They need to really improve their food all the way around.   
We can pay the same price at the Great Dane next door for way way better food and we are more than happy to pay 20% tip for a better dining experience.
Went here recently to see if anything had changed and ordered the turkey artichoke sandwich.  I used to order this one in past years.   What a got was a similar sandwich with spinach and turkey.  No artichoke.  I took it back to the counter and they said the artichoke is in there it is just in the sauce!   I should have refused it and ordered something else but I ate it and it was ok.   Very skimpy turkey portions in sandwich and mostly bread.   Way way overpriced for what I got.   This is really pathetic.
The interior is pretty clean and pleasant.  Many people like it for it's internet and coffee shop atmosphere I think and miss how crumby their actual food and service is.
I now lower them to 1 star.

update:  I stopped going to this place some time ago but returned because a friend insisted (above visit) and I won a 5 dollar gift card so I went there to use it up.
When I got there a manager was about to explain to a customer why her receipt was rung up the way it was and she said she didn't care to know.   But the manager insisted on explaining the bill to which she reluctantly allowed him to finish.  
Now when I am ordering at this place I am invariably asked again and again if I am ready to order.  Don't they see that I am looking at the menu which is hung behind them?  So I won't be ordering until I decide and when I decide I will know to walk up to the register to order.
I decided to try the Ham and Turkey Panini because it was a little more expensive and one I had not tried in the past.  I think it was 8.25.  So with my card I spent  three and a quarter.   The sandwich came with a bag of chips.  It was a pretty large sandwich and the bread was good.  The ham was of somewhat ample portions but the turkey was skimpy and the cheese was almost non-existent.   What they do is shave the cheese paper thin and put two slices on the sandwich.   This is not what I call a good panini.  I give it about a 6 as it was fresh and tasted ok.  But it was nothing to rave about nor come back for.  It should have cost around 5 bucks for its simplicity and skimpiness.   
Look at it this way.   I can buy a frozen dinner for 4 bucks which will have a protein, carb and vegetable and weigh in at about the same weight as the sandwiches I get from Panera.   But I have to pay double at this joint. 
Sadly, Panera didn't used to be like this.   They used to have a turkey artichoke sandwich that was loaded with artichoke, turkey and cheese and the bread was delicious.   So someone came in and revamped all the food and wrecked the place.
Amazingly this has not dampened the number of patrons.  What I think is happening here is that Panera has a type of coffeshop feel and people meet there for it's casual atmosphere without paying a lot of attention to the quality of their food.   They sit, they talk with friends and eat their food and just have a good time not realizing that they just got ripped off and made to wait on their own table!  I gotta hand it to them.  They sure pulled off a good scam when they came up with the idea for this place.
Now please.   No more gift certificates.   They are more \"insult certificates\" than anything.

Update: 2017.  I had a wonderful meal at the Panera Bread in West Bend not too long ago so I decided to order the same thing from this location to go.  Boy was this a mistake.  Are no two Panera Breads alike?  Mac and Cheese portion was about half of what I got at the West Bend location and my sandwich was skimpy and thus overpriced.  What a disappointment."}
{"text":"I got the broccoli and cheddar soup which I've had before but decided to get it in a bread bowl this time. It was pretty good and you could choose between a side of chips or apple. I don't normally go here solely for their food/drinks since I mainly just use it as a place to study. Food is average I have to say, but the second floor is a great place to get some work done!"}
{"text":"I frequently come here for my coffee and a bagel. I've also had a couple of their sandwiches but I am not a big fan. They are usually too oily, too bland. The only thing I would get on occasion is the Thai Chicken Salad, but it's quite pricey for what you actually get.
This particular store is so close to my home and that is the only reason for me to come back. Staff is very unfriendly and so terribly slow. 
Also, I have ordered bagels for meetings and they couldn't be bothered putting them in smaller paper bags, but threw 30 bagels in one big giant bag and threw the cream-cheese on top of it. I had to stop somewhere else to buy a couple of paper plates so it wouldn't look too bad at the meeting. I've recently asked if I could have 10 paper cups for coffee (while buying 30-40 bagels plus cream cheese) and it was not an option at all. Very poor service."}
{"text":"I didn't take out order for five people. Had a couple questions about the menu and the service was very good Corlee and Monica were very helpful and patient.  The food was prepared very quickly and it was fresh and tasty good"}
{"text":"This is a busy location but it's 2 floors and during slow times, panera is a great place for meetups, studying, etc"}
{"text":"If you enjoy overpriced, bland, hospital food...then this place is for you! Order for 2 ppl. rang up to over $36. A sandwich, soup and pasta dish and sides of chips and 2 drinks. The portions are small, like what is served to inpatients at a hospital. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm not normally one to write reviews, but when someone goes above and beyond to rectify a situation, I feel like they deserve some recognition. 

My mom and I had been at my grandma's apartment all day, getting it packed up to move her. We placed a to-go order from Panera for lunch and when I got back with the food, I realized that the dressing for my salad was missing and there was not a fork in the bag. Typically, the fork wouldn't have been a big deal, but since all of the utensils have already been moved, I really did need one. I called Panera and explained the situation to Melissa, the manager. She apologized profusely and told me that I could swing through the drive-thru to pick up my missing items. In addition to my salad dressing and fork, Melissa threw in all of these bakery items (YUM!) and wrote a sweet note on the bag. Now, THAT is what I call top-notch customer service."}
{"text":"This is a brand new Panera, and it's a great location: big, clean, and great jams!

The only downside, it's way too cold, like, bring a jacket cold. Also, no meeting space, but they will rope off a section in the back for you. The food is Panera, so it's okay, but nothing to write home about. At least the coffee is good and never-ending!"}
{"text":"it's panera. it will always just be okay... the coffee is alright though and usually fresh.   If your a squatter, panera is the place to be! you can do work on the wifi for hours and drink coffee till your hands shake!!"}
{"text":"Ok this is tough because the food itself is great, I love it. But I order online for delivery for lunch while I'm at work. This location ALWAYS leave stuff out. Every time I put extra of anything I either get none at all or barely anything. It is all the time. How do you get EXTRA confused with NONE, they do not pay attention at all. I am getting fed up with ordering online because it's never right. How do you mess up caesar salad with extra croutons? So upsetting. I want to give 4 or 5 stars for the food but I can't when my order is always wrong"}
{"text":"Horrible experience... I ordered an egg and sausage sandwich on bioche from the menu.  The egg is advertised as over easy.  What came is an egg cooked over had, with no yolk.  Following a trip to the cash register and another wait in line was the offer to remake the sandwich.  The second sandwich was half cooked, appeared sunny side up with runny slim all over the top.  I proceeded to the front, DID NOT receive an apology, asked for my money back, received the money back for sandwich (not the 2.39 fountain drink) and left.  If you cannot cook an egg, you shouldn't have an egg on the menu.  Also, customer service... kind of important!!  I will never return... BLACKLISTED!!"}
{"text":"Panera is my go-to trusted stop for a solid iced tea fill-up.  Laugh if you must, but good iced tea is important to this Texan. It can make or break my day.  

If I'm out and about and needing something to drink it's good to know there's someplace out there offering top notch, gourmet restaurant style iced tea for an affordable price.  At Panera you can get a large cup to go for a couple bucks. They've got mango (my favorite), regular unsweetened, and a tropical hibiscus, if your into that.

When they've got it in stock, there's nothing better around, and they keep the flavor pretty consistent.  I say \"when\" they've got it in stock because sometimes they run out and I don't realize this til after I've paid. I've made a habit out of checking the tea urns to see if their full before ordering.  Most of the time I get lucky though!

I'm not sure I can recommend the food. I haven't tried much.  I had a soufflé not too long ago, and it made a really decent breakfast for the price. Every time I've visited after, however, they've been sold out of these, so get here early if you're interested. Everything else I've had has just been so-so.

They do an excellent job at making you want every pastry and treat they offer. The display case is set up really nice and it's hard to pass up their sweets, or not order some form of bread selection from the wall.

I had a bagel the other day that had an okay taste, but was hard to chew. I'm not sure if it was way over toasted, or just really old. Either way, I don't think I'll order a bagel anytime soon.

The M&M cookie I tried had a burnt butter taste, and I didn't enjoy their cheese Danish either.

Definitely come here sometime because it's a really nice store and a decent place to hang out with family or co-workers and talk. There's free wifi, which is never a thing to pass up. The drinks are awesome, and despite some off experiences, I'm convinced they do have some decent food offerings."}
{"text":"Very bad experience. To start, they had no bread left? One family needed help with finding non soy products but it took three people to figure it out. The line could of gone a lot smoother than it did. After, they did not even apologize for making us wait an extra 20 minutes. Will not be returning and very disappointed. My sandwich also tasted like horse crap with a hint of ass..."}
{"text":"Worst Panera ever!!! They are always out of something or a machine is broken. In the past three weeks I have been there 4 times. Twice their toaster was broken in the morning. The third time they were out of American cheese. What restaurant runs out of cheese at 10:30 in the morning. Management really needs to either be replaced or trained properly. I'd rather drive a bit further and get better quality and service."}
{"text":"Went to this new location of Panera  bread on S Rainbow Blvd and was a little underwhelmed . Went for lunch and Service was average . The food was just average too . In the fast casual food market years ago Panera used to be at the top of the food chain but nowadays they are just an average sandwich shop . I got half  a sandwich and French onion soup with some apples .  The meal was underwhelming . But it is just lunch and a sandwich shop at that so what can be expected ."}
{"text":"I think it is THE place to go on Sunday afternoons.  It is packed like crazy.  Lines out of the door, people hoover around for tables, etc.  We placed our order and everyone is scrambling to find a place to sit.  Of course, the table is dirty...we wiped it out ourselves.  Our food came out to us, and of course someone was missing their meal.  The turkey & brie sandwich was ok, bland.  The potato soup was very good.  They did not give us enough silverware and we needed to flag someone down for that.  For the money spent, I rather go to a full service restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered for a 6am pick up for a party.  I got bagels, a ring of tarts, muffins, etc.  I was surprise when I got there, it was all packed and ready with napkins, utensils, and plates.  SWEET!  I have been back for sandwiches and soup.  1 con, the waiting area for togo/pick ups are very small and often a little dirty."}
{"text":"I had the worst Panera experience ever at this location.  

I ordered a chai latte and sat down with my computer.  I wanted to get a lot of work done, and I needed a little milky treat to get me started.  After a few minutes I went back up to pick up the drink but the girl was still working on it (even though there were no other drink orders other than mine).  I stand up there, and I can hear that the girl is not aerating my milk at all.  She's just keeping the wand all the way at the bottom of the pitcher.  Bad sign.  About 5 minutes later, I finally got my drink.  I was excited to finally have my warm, delicious chai, but I was so disappointed when I took off the lid and saw a thick skin on my milk.  

Having worked at coffee shops for many years, I knew that this meant that the girl had seriously scalded my milk.  I took it back up and asked her to remake it.  Now, let me tell you something.  I never complain about food or drinks.  I usually just live with it and/or throw it out.  But I don't complain.  This was disgusting, though, and I knew that if they remade it without scalding the milk, it would be fine.  The girl reluctantly agreed to make it, but only after acting like I was crazy and telling me that milk skin is normal.  Umm...no.

So she makes it again and when I get it, I take off the lid to check it out.  This time there's no skin, but my drink is curiously only 3/4 full.  I think, \"she did this on purpose to get back at me for having to remake my drink.\"  Instead of having her make it a third time, I ask for my money back.  They get the manager, who gives me a refund.  As I am getting my stuff to leave, the two girls behind the counter are audibly talking bad about me and laughing.

I will never, ever come back to this location."}
{"text":"Definitely not coming back here again. We've been waiting for 20 minutes for some damn bread bowls then they come here and tell us they ran out of clam chowder. You guys couldn't tell us at the counter earlier while we were paying? Customer service was horrible."}
{"text":"Ok...rough day, I run into Panera Bread for a sandwich.  I took it to go - get home opened the wrapper and saw this amazing MESS!!  I called the store and spoke with a shift supervisor who said that she had already spoke to the kid that made it.  She said she had reprimanded him already about how he was making the food.   Ummmmm...couple things wrong with that statement.   A - why Is he still making sandwiches?  And B - if you see and saw this MESS why did you let it go to a customer???
 
Unbelievable!!!!  BTW - it looks like I bit the sandwich....Nope!!!  It came that way!!!"}
{"text":"We order here from work often.
Its convenient because of the rapid pick-up. I've only had to wait around one time with ordering it this way.
The food always tastes good and fresh. The only time I've ever gotten something that I didn't like was one of their flat breads, which seemed soggy. 
Will continue to order from here because of the convenience and the quality of food that is available - just as quick as drive through fast food, but way healthier!"}
{"text":"Always double check your order.  They rarely get it right.  Just got home and they forgot to give me the cookies I ordered.  They don't qualify check, so you'd better."}
{"text":"I will never return to this Panera and the current manager should be replaced.
I ordered two soups and one cookie. The cashier told me they were OUT OF COOKIES after offering me one for 99 cents. The MANAGER was standing behind her and told me that they were not out, but that they had just come out of the oven and had not been frosted yet. AND he would not even go out of his way to frost ONE cookie for a customer because he was too busy placing his OWN order!!!!
The soup I ordered took over 10 minutes to fill two small bowls because the employees were just standing around chatting. As I walked out with my order, the same manager who could not be bothered with frosting a cooking stood at the door, in my way of exiting the place, to talk to an employee. In that time, he could have frosted about 3 dozen cookies!!  Nice customer service. This Panera is also really dirty, by the way."}
{"text":"I have always liked panera and this location is no exception. I always get the same thing (a chicken Caesar salad) and it always tastes  delicious. The service I got here was pretty decent. The line moved quickly, my food was out about the same time I filled my coffee and everything was about exactly what you expect... BUT...

But here's the deal. I know you can't expect to keep a dining room like this perfect all the time. But when I see an employee empty a trash can an walk right past tons of food on the ground some kid probably spilled... I mean really? It isn't the hardest thing to walk by once every 15 min or so (with as many people as they have working there) and quick sweep up big spills. Also, none of the tables were cleaned off when I got there or when Ieft. It would have been 5 stars from me... But alas."}
{"text":"Ridiculous!

My fiancé was nice enough to get my favorite chicken noodle soup bread bowl take-out after a long day of work. Too bad what I got was a bread bowl with a side of chicken broth (with literally a single noodle, and single piece of chicken and celery).

What's worse is that when we called to report our disappointment, the manager made excuses by saying that their soup was a \"low fat\" recipe that had less substance than other chicken noodle soups. 

As a customer, I don't want to hear excuses. As a business, you should be more than willing to correct a problem...especially when you have such a terrible Yelp rating.

Simply disappointed."}
{"text":"A great place to grab lunch during the week and do some work on my computer; good food and good environment."}
{"text":"This Panera Bread was a disappointment. The cashier didn't know what he was doing. The food was subpar. The bathrooms were dirty. There were teenagers hanging out right by the pick-up counter all over the food. They didn't even move when our food was called."}
{"text":"I love Panera and order delivery all the time, but this location is terrible. I was there for maybe 10 mins and saw at least 3 people get the wrong food. They forgot the chicken on my CHICKEN Caesar salad!"}
{"text":"I was here for business trip and Panera was closer to the hotel so I went in. The place was clean and spacious. The lady who helped me at the cashier had an attitude which she telling me that store will be closed in few mins, which is nonsense. They had full hour of business to be open. I guess she didn't want to work. 
I ordered a sandwich and a cup of soup, and my mother ordered same combo but a different sandwich. The iced coffee which they had at the counter was way water Dow iced coffee. It wasn't good at all. 
Couple mins later, we got our food. The food looks present well. The soup was lukewarm and not hot. The sandwich was not bad but too much pepper. I guess it's a Cleveland thing?"}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I chose to eat lunch at Panera Bread on Saturday afternoon. We went to Panera Bread inside Arrowhead Towne Center. We had a short wait to place our orders because the mall's food court was very busy.
I ordered the Italian sandwich with chips and green tea. The customer service was excellent and the waiting time for my order to be ready was relatively short.
My sandwich was fresh and tasty. It was loaded with Italian meats, provolone cheese, fresh vegetables and pesto spread. The chips were crispy and the green tea was refreshing. 
I enjoyed my lunch. Panera is great because they have something for everyone. If you come hungry, you leave satisfied."}
{"text":"My husband, two adult sons and daughter stopped in for a late lunch. We did the express order system. I found it to be easy and navigable. 
We ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with chips, cup of broccoli cheese soup with bread, Half green Goddess Cobb salad/chicken with fruit cup, BLT roasted turkey with provolone cheese and chips, walnut chicken salad-half with side green salad and chips/bread, tortellini and bread; mango tea, Pepsi and Sierra Mist and water rounded out the meals. 
Can you say Hungry? We were and we ate with gusto! Everything was fresh and every bite was delicious. 
The restaurant is clean, the employees helpful and the restrooms clean and tidy. We will be back."}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff. Food is to be as expected, Panera's are always consistent, which is good. But they forgot the cream cheese. Pretty simple, bagel + cream cheese."}
{"text":"The saddest grilled cheese ever. Ugh ! Plain white bread, only one side grilled (is that cause I got 1/2 a sandwich?), hardly any cheese. Blah! Was better when you were paradise bakery! They lured us in with the promise of paradise :("}
{"text":"Not too bad if you have to stop and get a snack.  The food is alright but a little pricey for my taste.. not saying it's uber expensive, but there are other grubs in the area that would rather mosey on over to instead of Panera.  What I do like is the fresh lemonades they have.  Usually pretty tart and not overly sweet, I find myself getting just this when I stop by rather than something to eat.

The bread is tasty but not tasty enough to draw me in very often.. ok grubs for an ok lunch at a little-over-ok price."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the quality of food, the pick 2 is my go to and this time I tried the Broccoli soup...very tasty.  It was busy but the speed of service and the staff was awesome!  Everyone I came into contact with was nice and helpful.  Place was clean, even in the restrooms.  I will return when in that area."}
{"text":"Catering manager Danielle lacks service and follow up."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I hope to prevent some other person or group disappointment with this store. Don't get me wrong Panera has a great menu with great food, when it's prepared correctly. I work at a job where I buy my employees food occasionally, and we have ordered through the catering website a few times previously. Many times, at least three I can remember off hand, that our order was not correct. Either sandwiches were made wrong, we were given the wrong salads or even worse orders were completely left out and not in with a large group order. I'm not sure how this happens as the group order is written and the person who prepares it, just has to read off the paper order. It is just a terrible feeling when you have to tell your employee their lunch is not here. We have complained previously and have spoken to managers where we've been told to call in (after placing the online order)and speak to someone to ensure the order is seen,reviewed, and make sure it would be ready within the allotted time. After doing this, they still have left out lunch orders completely off our large group order. 
I don't recommend placing large orders online through this location! It is a guaranteed let down! Take your business elsewhere! They don't even care that they have made mistakes! No apologies, no attempts for any compensations. Not a good way to run a business."}
{"text":"Great location in southwest vegas. Quick, easy, affordable, and good meals. I just had a drink but my sweet little niece had the mac and cheese...which was great.

If you need a quick bite this place is great!"}
{"text":"A chain restaurant with good food and a tad high prices. Normally I wouldn't review but the service at this panera was pretty bad. If you want panera I'd recommend another location."}
{"text":"This location has horrible customer service.  No one smiles or wants to be there.  And the pasta was disgusting and completely undercooked.   Worst ever I could not even eat it.   Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"I've never actually been anywhere with bad service.  But I really like their drip coffee and their cinnamon scone.  I pass by it all the time whenever I go to the Eaton Center so I thought I'd try it out for the first time and I am glad I did!  After eating the scone, I said to myself, \"Is this what Heaven tastes like?\"  Haha"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying this review is specifically for this Panera at McCandless Crossing.  After doing some investigating, it's a franchised store and apparently this franchise just doesn't give a rat's behind.  I've had plenty of good experiences with Panera, so I don't want to overgeneralize.

First, whoever designed this store should never work again.  You can fit like three people in line before everyone's having to stand out the door, weaving here and there to let people out.  On to the real issue, though.  This store is the closest to my house and we've tried repeatedly to pick up orders to go there.  Every time we get home and realize that multiple parts of the order are wrong.  We've taken to trying to remember each time to check the bag and have them fix the mistakes before we leave, but there are times when you're just in a rush and don't end up doing that part of their job for them.  Today we had multiple parts of our order wrong, and the manager was the one packing the order!  When we got home and realized that the sandwich was the wrong sandwich and the salad was just plain missing from the bag, the \"manager\" said I could either come down and get a free pastry or get a free \"you pick 2 coupon\" in the mail.  They've had to give me coupons before, and quite frankly, I would much rather just get a correct order than have to  be offered a stupid coupon every time I come to the store.  I will drive to Wexford or down to McKnight if I want Panera; this place has been like this since they've opened and there's no excuse any more.  They're relying off of the popularity of McCandless Crossing but refusing to actually make their restaurant a better run operation.  Panera, keep an eye on your franchises: I'm reasonable enough to realize that this one store shouldn't represent the company as a whole, but not everyone's so understanding."}
{"text":"Maybe I should have checked this place out on Yelp before I ever stepped foot in this establishment. This morning I decided to go for a light breakfast in which was the biggest mistake I've made. I order a bagel/cream cheese sandwich in which the sign reads 2.39 plus tax. I was charged 2.96 which included tax but how is it that I was charged nearly 60 cents in taxes. I was trying to explain that the the cashier before he stormed off to his co-worker to tell him \"I am being effing cheap\". Well I heard the conversation and he told me that I am being cheap for 50 cents while he is laughing. 

Future customers beware of the harassment of this establishment. Managers will not take appropriate actions on their employees so think twice before coming in here. Unbelievable how rude a company can be while they think it's okay to talk down to people."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time. Probably  an average 1-2 times a week. Not the best food but many things we do quite enjoy quite a bit. I love their broccoli and cheese soup and Mac n cheese a lot. 

In the early days of this location opening, they would forget items almost every order. Whether it was a ladle, bowls, or even the bread. Once they forgot my smoothie. I liked the food enough and they were nice about. We kept going back. 

We used to have them deliver a lot, but those were the orders that were always missing stuff. Once we started just going there, the forgetfulness got a lot better. Still something occasionally but not much. Plus the delivery might be available one day but not the next... hate looking it up to be disappointed. 

I really been enjoying their chili, so a couple days ago my wife went to get us dinner. She ordered for the family and spent over $50. 

She gets it home to me and there is a long hair in my food. We called them up, and they said we can get the whole order replaced on our next visit (my wife even spelled her name over the phone to them), they would put a note in the system.  this was 3 days ago.  

Still craving my chili, my wife texted me today asking what I wanted on her way back from Walmart. Chili!!!

So she orders the same exact same thing, tells them we have a credit. They asked her to pull forward and they would look it up. 

Well... it turns out they never wrote our info down. Called the manager over, and she was rude, acting like we were making this up. Offered us a bowl of soup, which we refused (I'm not eating anything from people that treat us like that). How dare they treat a very regular customer this way. The manager should be replaced, unacceptable, a manager should know this. Her name was Asia and extremely rude. Seemed like she came to the window wanting to pick a fight. 

We left with no food and no doubt in our mind, this place is on the never visit again list. 

Kind of a bummer. $50 worth of food trashed and lost a favorite spot."}
{"text":"This place is terrible, and the people where so rude. My sandwich looked as if they just tossed everything on a plate. The salads were crap and the ice machine was broke and they had a sign saying the ice is in the bucket next to the soda fountain, very unsanitary."}
{"text":"Inconsistent service for pick up orders, not enough staffed people at the order counter.  I always use the automated order kiosk here.  It's super easy but I do it because they only seem to staff one person to place orders.  Probably a conspiracy to use the automated stations LOL.  Wait time for pick up is super fast sometimes but then others your order seems to be left in the dust bin behind others who ordered behind you.  

Lastly parking during lunch is a bitch, unless you want to use a back parking lot.  Place is just no longer Paradise in many ways."}
{"text":"Dreamy orange muffins, lemon zester cookies, and peanut butter chocolate chip cookies.  I went in this morning and ordered a bacon cheesy something something sandwich.  It wasn't bad it wasn't good.  It was non descriptive.   I figured that going forward I would just stick with the lunch sandwiches and salads.  I decided to grab a couple cookies and then saw this glazed orange muffin smile at me.  I couldn't resist, I ordered that to go as well.  It was perfect, I moved on from that mediocre breakfast sandwich in three bites.  Staff is friendly.  I don't like the parking here or lack of it but this is trending in a few places in Phoenix now.  Lastly on the lunch combos, they will let you substitute a cookie of your liking.  Try the lemon zester, it's like a refreshing lemon drop martini at happy hour."}
{"text":"Great soups and awesome muffins!  We're having an unplanned \"lunch\" date with our first born granddaughter Alysson \"Aly\" Marie. She even got a muffin for tomorrow's breakfast!  Bet it won't last till then!!!!!"}
{"text":"Order the bread bowl with cheddar broccoli and honestly I think they gave me 4 spoons of soup. For $7 I think you should get a little more soup than that. It was really pitiful. They out pricing themselves."}
{"text":"So disappointed in the quality and very small potion of the kids mac n cheese. Three bites for my 8 yr old and its gone. No cookie. No drink. And it was $6. Wont go back."}
{"text":"We were looking for a breakfast place but all restaurants were packed. We spotted this place and figured why not! It turned out to be the most efficient spot. They have kiosks where you can order on your own, no lines, and pretty much self serve! You then find a seat and they bring the food to you. The food is fast and delicious and they have a ton of drink options. We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This cafe is pretty busy but most staffs are very helpful and friendly.
I love Mediterranean Veggie Sandwich and creamy Tomato soup."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Panera location for a very long time and have noticed a significant decline in quality and experience. As managers have switched over time, I feel like this location is yet to find a good fit. 
The menu changes very often and is now much more limited than it once was. I know this may be out of control of the location, but I'm not happy about it. 
My latest experience was not good at all. I waited in line for 15 minutes with only one person before me because the girl working cash had no idea what was going on or how to cut bread. After serving the person before us, she asked someone else if they were ready to order even though we had clearly been in line before the other party had even walked in. 
When paying, we were shortchanged $5 and it seemed intentional, as the manager who took over cash punched in $45 rather than $50 which seems suspicious as it is one bill and it wouldn't make sense to punch in the numbers in that order. 
The food was okay, but the salads were very underdressed. There was a big globe of dressing near the bottom, but that's about it. 
It's unlikely that I will return."}
{"text":"We just came here for a late lunch. There was no line but since the last time I have come panera has changed their menu. One of my favourite items is now gone :( the chipotle chicken has now become a chipotle chicken avocado melt. It was basically a toasted panini but the chipotle chicken and bacon version was much better. And to top it all off they ran out of smoked pulled chicken for their sandwich and so I had to get a turkey substitute instead. Not a big deal but just sad that they had to take a good thing away for a healthier alternative, why fix it if it's not broken."}
{"text":"This is a typical Panera Bread location.  They have the usual sandwiches, soups, and salads. I come to this location typically for breakfast sandwiches and iced coffee. The egg and cheese on brioche is my favorite breakfast sandwich. The egg is cooked perfectly over easy and the brioche is light and fluffy. I love having their iced coffee - it's batch made and served chilled with unlimited refills. I do the iced coffee with a splash of hot hazelnut coffee for just a bit of nutty flavor. Add some half and half and you're good to go!"}
{"text":"This particular Panera branch is absolutely horrid. I ordered a simple bagel with cream cheese, sliced and toasted. When I got my bagel, the top portion had been sliced so thin (literally, it was 1-2cm thick) that it burned to the consistency of a potato chip. When I inquired about possibly getting a new bagel, the individual behind the counter said \"no,\" and that it was \"your fault for ordering it toasted.\" Wtf? 

On a separate visit with my family, the soups and mac n cheese we ordered ranged from  lukewarm to bone cold. When we took them back to the counter, we were instructed to use the microwave located near the napkin dispenser. Again, wtf??! 

AVOID this Panera Bread like the plague. It's most certainly not up to the par of other Panera locations.

EDIT: I've called corporate regarding my above experiences, and was informed that I was not the first person to complain about this particular branch. Just an FYI."}
{"text":"Not feeling it anymore Panera.  I used to look forward to my visits.  Now, they happen simply out of necessity.   

Bagels, salads, and coffee, still rank, but the menu overall is getting old in my opinion.  The quality of the food, and it's appearance, seems to be lacking pizzazz. 

Overall, I always found my visits to Panera to be a great place for a quick bite.  Dining area is comfortable , staff is prompt with food preparations, and prices are reasonable.   I like the Panera reward offers, but seldom do I find myself craving anything listed on the menu board.

Today's experience was less than ideal when I found a hair in my food, but it was addressed properly by management, and would not be the reason I find myself drifting away.

Perhaps with some tweaking, I will discover a more appealing seasonal menu in the months to come.  The old standby options are not doing it for me."}
{"text":"I've never been a complainer but today I ordered a steak and cheese sandwich from Panera light cheese I ate it not 15 min later I begin to feel sick so I lay down for 30 get up and throw up everything I just ate completely disgusted with the food and the fact I threw it up considering contacting corporate will never order from this place again"}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location. My panini was a little burnt and my broccoli and cheese soup was lukewarm. At the drink counter, an off the clock employee spilled her ice water on my foot. The inside and outside of the restaurant was dirty. Tables needed to be cleared and wiped down. Dirty dishes were on the tables, the floors needed sweeping or vacuuming. Employees were nice, but someone needs to step up in keeping the restaurant clean."}
{"text":"Even though Panera isn't a locally owned business, I feel i owe it to them to write a good review for using up their services. For the longest time this place has been my go-to spot to do some work. 

Free wifi! I come here to use their internet and have lunch, but even if I don't buy anything sometimes, they never find it necessary to boot me out or refuse service to me. I usually sit in a booth because of the big table space, and its good for some private seclusion from everything else that's going on in the cafe. It helps me focus more. 

The great pro about this place:
They have an awesome you pick two deal which is an option to choose two of any three: cup of soup, 1/2 a cafe sandwich, or 1/2 a cafe salad for 6.99. 
They also have a member rewards card that's free for every time you come. Which has a whole bunch of benefits (I honestly haven't read the benefits yet because I just signed up).
The service is great! NAKANA is such a sweet heart, and very friendly. 

I sometimes find all sorts of people studying here, conducting interviews, doing meetings, or just people socializing on their lunch break. So you get that great \"work\" environment with a casual ambiance to the place. 

All these pros just give me a reason to go back, and I partially thank them for helping me with my current success in life (passing my exams, and getting good grades in class)..

So thanks Panera!"}
{"text":"Aargh! I bought a whole turkey sandwich because the half was only $2 less, and that seemed like a rip-off. My frustration comes from the fact that they give you what looks like two whole sandwiches. I don't know about other people, but \"half\" of their sandwich is the size I would make at home as a whole sandwich. I'm so tired of the massive portions all places seem to hand out. I also find it ironic that a place that has \"Bread\" in their name serves such dry, flavorless bread. (I had the whole grain.) If the bread had been better, the sandwich wouldn't have been too bad...

My last whiny gripe here is that I hate how all the Paradise Bakeries turned into Paneras. Paradise used to give you a cookie with your meal, but Panera offers the *special deal* of giving you the privilege of paying 99 cents for one. 

I will add though that the guy on the register was extremely friendly and nice. Everything else about Panera will keep me away in the future."}
{"text":"I absolutely do no know why I continue to try to patronize this Panera! I am a long time customer of this company and when they opened the Euclid Ave location I was excited because it is conveniently located on my way to work. However... The service is now and has always been terrible. This morning for example I ordered a toasted bagel with cream cheese and a medium coffee. When I got the coffee it had coffee grounds in it so I told the employee that I needed a new cup and that someone needs to change the coffee. Very unbothered she gave me a new cup and when I tried one of the other selections it was empty!! This is before 7am... How do you not have coffee and your open for breakfast ? At this point extremely frustrated I asked to speak to a manager because they still had not changed the other coffee and they cared nothing about other patrons drinking coffee grounds. The manager was aloof for a lack of better words, she looked like she had just woken up 15 min prior and when I told her I wanted my money back for the order she only reversed the charges for the coffee not the bagel. Since I'm on my way to work I don't have time to argue.. So now I have a bagel from Panera and coffee from Duncan doughnuts which is hot and fresh!! I'll never go back!"}
{"text":"Ordered bagels for a group (3 Bagel Packs) and received several complaints that the bagels were old and hard. However when we communicated this to the manager, they provided us with a refund. Great customer service, very responsive!!!"}
{"text":"Nice outdoor patio. Very friendly and helpful staff and managers."}
{"text":"The worst customer experience at any Panera I've been to.  The staff as lazy and are unaware to help you.  They will walk by and stare at you and never open another line, even if there are 10-15 people in line.  The newer manager they have there is lazy and incompetent as well."}
{"text":"The lady at the counter is being an absolute idiot i was standing in line and some other lady cut in front of me and got her order before mine and the lady said nothing"}
{"text":"Check the bottom of your samie, they burnt mine. Only posting cause this is the second time. Ran out of half and half,  brought over the empty one for refilling, shift supervisor at 9 am told me well there is another one. That was empty too. A thank you would have been nice. What's happening to this place??"}
{"text":"NEVER order for delivery from this location!!! Ordered over an hr ago and STILL isn't here. Called location and spoke to female manager and was offered nothing but sorry it's traffic. Just lost a frequent customer!!!!!"}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch through the drive thru. Order was correct. Food was fresh and delicious. Service was quick and employees were very friendly. So happy to have a Panera close to home and added bonus is that they have a drive thru! :)"}
{"text":"Decided to try Panera out with my husband around 8pm tonight and were terribly disappointed. Waited roughly 20 minutes after ordering and receiving our buzzer, with no one calling out our food or the buzzer going off. Keep in mind, there were 4 tables occupied in the entire establishment at this time and we had ordered a bowl of mac & cheese and a salad. Both our meals had been sitting out nearly for 15 minutes so I asked the cashier if I could just grab my food that had been sitting there; she didn't even look up,  and said \"sure\" as if not even caring about the fact that I had not gotten my food for 20 minutes. As I grabbed my food an employee from the back comes out and says \"oops.\" We will not be coming back, and do not recommend this establishment; customer service is horrible with no regards to the customer or professionalism at all. If you're looking for a good sandwich, pasta and salad place, Kneaders down the street has far better customer service and employees that truly care about the customer."}
{"text":"Ordered TOGO a pick 2 with a chicken Caesar salad and a bowl of chicken soup and dinner roll... didn't know until I get home that there's no chicken in my salad, no roll, and my soup was a small cup and had more broth than anything in it. I seriously spent $11 for this mess and it's not okay. Check your order before handing it out!!!"}
{"text":"Recently ordered a bagel pack from this location with two cream cheese tubs. Had my heart set on asiago and everything bagels to share with company the following morning. I tried out their rapid pick-up order on my way home, normally I pick bagels from Chompy's but this sounded better.

I was called to be advised neither of my bagel flavors were available. Almost all the available bagels were sweet, which I'm not a huge fan of. I asked if they had any bagels that were not sweet and advised only the sprouted grain was available. I hesitantly asked for the 6 sprouted grains, and ended up getting only 5. The rest of my bagels were made up of french toast, cinnamon raisin, and cinnamon crunch. I also had to change one of my cream cheese tubs over the phone to honey walnut to match the bagels, which would have been great if they didn't give ones that expired in four days. Also they don't give you tubs, they give you four individual packets instead which was a bit of a surprise.

The bagels were not great, most were pretty hard and stale, I would be surprised if they weren't baked a day go. The sprouted grain bagel ended up being half the size (apparently a flat bagel, this was never communicated to me by the employee) of the other bagels and hard. Not exactly the type of bagel you want for straight cream cheese for a bagel breakfast. 

I can say the best part of the experience was that the order was ready quickly without a line up. I will never order bagels this way again though, and will just go to Chompy's. They always have tons of bagels in stock no matter what time you go and they taste a lot more fresh!

I did email Panera head office to express my experience, but received a very canned and insincere response. Not impressed."}
{"text":"This location's food is phenomenal and the prices are good. Staff are always polite and the restaurant is always clean. They are highly recommended."}
{"text":"Worlds worst panera. If you need to be somewhere relatively quickly don't come here. Even if you schedule your order to be ready an hour+ in advance, it won't be ready on time. Staff is so slow and just plain don't pay attention to what they're doing."}
{"text":"I had a soup and panini, my panini was more of a lame grilled cheese with a hint of chicken. My cup of soup was missing about half of the soup.
I like Panera, but this place is not good."}
{"text":"I generally like idea of Panera. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich. It was promptly served piping hot. I would be willing to bet that it was cooked ahead and then zapped in the microwave. If somebody from Panera let's me know that they ARE NOT microwaving there stuff I will take this review down.   What next--hot pockets?"}
{"text":"Healthy food and extremely popular. Place is packed with people. If you like healthy, this is the place to come to. Has a Starbucks look w with the upscale plastic glasses and little nick nacks for sale. A little rooming AC for my taste but overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"This location is pretty consistent all the way around. I use to come by more often when I was studying nearby. It's a great place to just grab a soup and maybe a drink and just hang out upstairs in their quiet area. You got WiFi here which is timed though. I can't recall how we got around that =P But atleast you know you can work here! 

The food is okay. I came more for the lounging quiet space than for the food to be honest. I love the smoothies and the soups are usually good. I find the sandwhiches are sometimes really good and loaded, and other times I'm getting something a bit less stuffed and more burned. I stick to the smoothies and now the kale ceasar.. Eveyrthing here is pretty over priced but service is good.

Get a membership cause every so often you get a free hot beverage or some pastry. :)"}
{"text":"Panera is a nice spot to visit and fairly consistent across properties. This location is pretty big and I didn't find it to be busy when I visited so it was nice to enjoy a quiet meal. Service is great here and food is consistent.
I ordered the pick 2 option. 
I love their salads because they are always evenly dressed, not too light but not drenched in sauce.
The sandwich was not really enjoyable. I ordered the chicken avocado melt. There was hardly anything in the sandwich and the avocado were falling out. I liked the grill on the bread though

Honestly Panera is a nice place to go once in a while, but I think it's very much over priced for what you get. Never ever ever get take out because the portion sizes shrunk by a ridiculous amount!"}
{"text":"Nice to have a Panera near by but honestly service here has been horrible. I've been here about 7 times now and more than half my visits had issues with order mix ups. I understand mistakes happen, but it's the staff attitude I don't appreciate.

Just right now, I ordered a smoothie. My boyfriend started to take out cash while I looked for my Panera card. She cashed it out before even asking for my card and when I showed it to her, she just plainly said \"it's to late..\".. 

She didn't ask if I had a membership, didn't really answer my question when I asked what was in the smoothie, and then just plainly said \"it's too late\" in a tone.

Oh, and have you tried to take take-out from here? The portion of your salad will surprise you. You get a small little box that's enough to top a sandwich instead of the full size salad lunch you would expect. 

This place is an over priced, rip off."}
{"text":"The food is good and I love the ice tea selection but it is on the expensive side for what you actually get. The service is fast and friendly though and the restaurant is very clean and organized. The only reason I gave this review 4 stars is because of the prices."}
{"text":"I am always a huge fan of Panera Bread in general. And in fact, one of their other locations gives my non-profit whatever is left at the end of the day once a week.

This visit was frustrating because they seemed to be short handed at the register and the two seniors ahead of me in line took what seemed like a lifetime to sample the soups before they ordered. I just wanted a cup of coffee and a cookie"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Panera Bread as a whole and they support feeding the hungry by donating their end of day inventory to supporting non-profits. I don't go in very much because I am trying to cut down on carbs but I had to kill 2 hours before my hair appointment next door.

I ordered the Ham and Cheese sandwich which is served on a very soft wheat bread. Soft was good because I have a tooth issue and can't bite into anything hard for another week.

They offer you two side choices. And apple or a piece of hard crust baguette. I asked for a substitution because of my teeth and they would not bend. Setting aside apple is an option, who in there right mind would order a full sandwich which has 4 pieces of bread and a side of crusty bread. Maybe for soup but this side offering makes no sense."}
{"text":"Went today during the lunch rush, so I understand it was busy, but I ordered a salad to go, and my name or number wasn't called. A young associate actually looked at the bag, looked in the bag and walked away. I finally went up to the counter and they said, oh yeah, that's your order. So baffled why the associate didn't ask me if it was my order when I was clearly standing right in front of her holding my to go number. Big fail - train your employees to have better service. The guy who took my order was great, so one star for front of house service."}
{"text":"I was surprised at the wide variety they had in their menu (sandwiches, soups, baked goods and even pasta).  I like the set up of the place where you order and sit down and they bring you your food.  I also like how meals come with a side apple or baguette (or something else I couldn't remember) - I wasn't expecting that.

I had the mushroom soup and half grilled cheese.  The grilled cheese was very tasty.  The mushroom soup on the other hand - I didn't hate it, but I was expecting it to be more mushroom tasting.  It almost seemed like mushroom tomato soup.

I tried my boyfriend's pasta - it was pretty average, but the portion was a lot bigger than we expected - and quite filling with the pasta, soup and baguette!  

Prices were surprisingly decent.

I was very unimpressed, however, with the baked good I bought.  I cannot remember what it's called for the life of me but it was some sort of apple strudel/cinnamon bun mix.  It was so sweet, and the raisins were over powering.  The worst part about it though...it was dry as hell.  It had obviously been sitting there all day.

I feel like the best way to describe this chain is like a middle class Tim Horton's."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic, but the experience left a lot to be desired.  I walked in for the first time, looked right, then left at some kiosks, then walked to a line at the back of the store.  I want to be helped by people, not machines.  Anyway, I get my food, I start eating, and the food manager is shouting to the workers, \"WHO ISN'T PUTTING LIDS ON THE FOOD?!?!  COME ON, LET'S GO, LET'S GO!!!  WHERE'S THIS, LET'S GO, LET'S GO!!!!\" I mean, I understand that you want to do your job, but you don't need to shout at your staff in front of the whole restaurant.  It was just hard to enjoy my food, because I felt bad for the staff."}
{"text":"First time I've had a bad item.  Treated today for a belated birthday lunch and ordered half a grilled cheese sandwich with the tomato bisque.  As usual, the soup was awesome (the only reason I rated the meal with two stars) and the grilled cheese was HORRID!  The bread tasted like cardboard, it was overcooked, and I am suspicious as to whether there was actually any cheese between the bread.  Worst lunch in a very long time. The chocolate macaroon and the soup was the only saving grace.  SO  Disappointed."}
{"text":"The employees all seem very unhappy to be here.  I'm not even saying they aren't making the effort to smile, they seem to be making the effort to frown.  Doing there job seems to be a pain.  Seemed annoyed to answer questions.  The facility is nice and the food is good like any other Panera but portions are small compared to price."}
{"text":"The worst Panera I've ever been to! Been here a few times now and it's my last. Service slow, orders messed up all the time and dirty most of the time! How do you have one person working up front at 9:40am on a Sunday!!!! People walking out left and right! If you can find another place to go in the area, I'd drive there!"}
{"text":"Oh GOD BLESS PANERA for coming uptown for those of us wanting more lunch options during the workweek!!!!  This location opens today in the Charlotte Plaza building (same building as Bentley's etc. next door to the EpiCentre)  This new Panera location is also boasting weekend hours - I love it!  Their current operating hours are M-F 6AM-7PM, Sat 7-7 and Sun 7-5.  Yahoo!!  :-D

My favorite lunch here is the Chicken and Wild Rice soup which they have on the menu Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Get the You Pick Two if  you are really hungry or hungover - my fav sandwich here is the Sierra Turkey.  

I noticed new outside seating too!  This spot will be awesome in the Spring :-D"}
{"text":"I normally order deliver from this location. Very often my order is slightly wrong (bagel not sliced or toasted, meat added to vegiterian pasta) but delivery is always earlier than expected. In one occasion. I ordered delivery ahead (a few hours) but 15 minutes later they called saying they were at the location.  When I actually got my food a few hours later, it was cold, as if it was left in the delivery car until my delivery time."}
{"text":"The staff are very friendly and punctual, every time I order rapid pickup the order is ready early. They are usually not busy in house during the evenings, but will not deliver to ASU campus, though they will deliver further from ASU"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.   Staff yelled at my mother with dementia when she was in the wrong line.   I requested a call from a manager and never got one."}
{"text":"Completely empty at dinner time for a good reason.   This is the worst run Panera in North America.   They are constantly out of food.  Their \"rapid\" pick up is anything but,  usually 10 minutes late.  Which is amazing since there's never anyone in here.   Just go to the one at Dana Park or Queen Creek instead.   Luckily this place will be closed soon so you won't have to be disappointed."}
{"text":"If there was a negative star, this store would take it. It's not even 9am yet and they ran out of bagel and souflet. WTF?!?  The cheap ass franchisee who owns this location should have his license revoke.  For a classic Panera service and selection head to the Square One location.  It's corporate and they do things the right way!"}
{"text":"We don't try Panera often, but compared to other locations,  this new Waverly location is very nice. Clean interior,  friendly fast service.   We only had coffee and a Greek yogurt which was fine."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service.  Always busy but the line usually moves quickly.  Went there for lunch and my bill was $11-$12, for the soup/salad combo with a drink.  A little pricey for the amount of food they gave.  The salad was served in a huge bowl but it was almost empty.  I was surprised at how small the serving of salad was.  Overall, good place for lunch but not worth the money in my opinion."}
{"text":"Yesterday I was at Panera's in Mentor - placed my order and went to the restroom to wash my hands. From out of the handicap stall came an employee with a dirty bandaged hand. She exited the stall and proceeded to walk out of the bathroom. I asker her, \"shouldn't you wash your hands?\" She looked at me as if I were nuts. She replied, \"I didn't use the bathroom, I just changed the toilet paper roll.\" And then she walked out and immediately pushed open the kitchen door and entered the kitchen. I asked to speak to the manager, Mark. I told him what happened and again he gave me the same blank look as the toilet paper/kitchen girl. So I actually had to explain basic hand hygiene and public safety to him. She may not have been wiping her behind - but she was touching the toilet paper roll, the door handles, etc. And the filthy bandage on her hand was surely capable of harboring some kind of nasty bacteria. Then she wandered back in to the kitchen to handle who knows what! \"I'll speak to her\" was Mark's response. I watched as he walked into the kitchen and walked out without speaking to anyone. This is how the public is exposed to germs, bacteria, ecoli, etc. This lack of protocol and common sense is a public health menace and I AM contacting Panera corporate and the State of Ohio Health Department. I Will NOT eat there again. It's called \"Dangerous Dining\" and I encourage readers to be on the lookout for this kind of irresponsible behavior. Shame on the nonchalant manager Mark for allowing employees to do double duty!"}
{"text":"Ok - here we go. The food is really ok. But here's where I have a serious problem. I stop by here once a week to grab a quick dinner and each and every time I have witnessed a major lack of proper handwashing and glove protocol. Oh - perhaps there is NO protocol.

Watch for this: The person taking your sandwich order is wearing gloves. He or she picks up the pen to write down your order (hint - who else has touched this pen?) Next the pen-person hands you a red plastic number (hint - how many other customers have touched this number with their e-coli, bacteria rich hands?) Then the pen-red plastic number person turns around, grabs your bread and begins to make your sandwich still wearing the same pair of gloves.

Next, this very same person wanders around the restaurant looking for you in the hopes of delivering your sandwich. Can't find you? Maybe you're outside on the patio. So the gloved sandwich maker/delivery person opens the door to the outside (hint - same gloves now touch the filthy door handle twice) As the nasty gloves deliver your sandwich - they once again pick up your red plastic number and head back to the counter to write up someone else's order and spin around to handle the bread.

Yes - I've spent many times watching this process over and over again at this location. Here's a question you should ask the manager: Whom do the gloves protect? The sandwich maker or the customer? I'm sure you know the answer. Apparantly the kids who work there wear the same pair of gloves all day.

This is a health hazard - it's called cross contamination. This is how people get sick. It's dangerous and ridiculous. The manager insists that they do have a glove protocol. Yes they do and it is called \"only use one set of gloves per shift\"

One afternoon I saw a father pick up each of his two young daughters and stood them on the metal bars used to slide the trays. Both kids leaned over the salad sneeze bar with their faces almost touching the food on the other side. Oh how cute! Look at the two germy kids contaminating the salad area. No one said anything but then again the employees are just kids themselves with no understanding of sanitary behavior. 

This is the fault of management. Training needs to be strict and exact and someone needs to follow up, watch, reprimand, retrain ... Public safety is at stake. The health department is my next phone call.

I encourage you to watch for this behavior - not only at this location - but at every eatery. Say something when you see less than appropriate handwashing and glove use. How about some old man's feces with your bagel???"}
{"text":"It was ok to me - the bagel was a little tough & didn't really care for their coffee."}
{"text":"Ok so I have been a regular at Panera for some time but since the buyout things have changed. For the last few visits the food has not been as good. One of my salads was filled entirely of little bushes and trees and was inedible. I even asked for spinach in the salad but there was little spinach. The bushy lettuce had taken root and overgrown the spinach. The size and shape of the salad bowl has also changed and after I sans a few ingredients that do not agree with me I am left with little salad for the price. The soup is still good but the bread also does not seem fresh and is not as good as it used to be. Also the Lake Meade location was not that clean and it was fairly hot inside and I'm one that always carries my Linus blanket ( jacket) with me. I am sadly no longer a fan and look to replace my Panera habit with another chain such as Cantors deli in Tivoli Village. I hope that Panera can pull it together because as my friends and I have discussed, Panera appears to be losing steam. But you can decide if you're all aboard or not."}
{"text":"This location is awful! Will not eat at this location again. I ordered a Fugi apple chicken salad minus cheese, nuts and tomatoes. I was looking forward to the apple chips in the salad. They didn't tell me they were out. They were also out of butter and apples or chips as a side. And they must have been nearly out of chicken because I needed a magnifying glass to find the chicken in the salad. I don't think there was an ounce of chicken in the salad. If the buyout of Panera Bread has anything to do with all of these problems then count me out for good. And I eat at Panera several times a week. Also they never added my points to my card for the last 3 times I ate here and I gave them the correct phone number to look up my info. What gives Panera? A very very unhappy customer! Can no longer recommend Panera."}
{"text":"Service here is pretty bad. They were out of napkins and cup lids. I ordered chicken tortellini pasta and chicken noodle soup. My chicken seemed undercooked in the pasta and there wasn't any chicken in my soup."}
{"text":"Super busy all the time. Parking sucks, too many shops not enough spaces!
Food is great, a little to pricey in my opinion.
Staff is not very personable but probably because they are so busy.
The floors needs to be swept up!"}
{"text":"Yummy.
I love the breakfast Souffles - check em out.
 If you dont have a local Bakery/ Deli this is the next best thing. The food is not great but it is strong. And, the bread is good/fresh. I mean it does have bread in the name so it better be. I agree with other posters that the price tilts towards the pricey side. But Ill pay for a little bit of quality vs a plate load of crap."}
{"text":"Usually I love Paradise Café. However, I have given this one four or five different tries. Unfortunately this one does not make the cut is not make the cut.  I don't know how you can mess up the salad but they manage to do it each and every time.  Ordered one half of a sandwich and after one by the bread was crumbling apart.  I specifically asked to make sure the bread was fresh because I've had this problem time and time again.  I guess they can't tell the difference between stale dry and fresh bread.  

And last but not least is the Joker that works the cash register.  If he would just do his job and quit trying to entertain it might be a nice experience.

Won't be coming back here, maybe another paradise café but not this one"}
{"text":"So I let it slide when you took the California turkey sandwich off the menu, but this time, I just can't overlook it.  My hubby and I were craving Paradise last night, so I went in to place a to-go order.  I ordered the BBQ chicken salad for my hubby.  The girl tells me it is no longer on the menu.  \"You mean you still have the ingredients for it but it isn't on the menu anymore?\"  I asked.  Nope... you can't order it at all, she tells me.  It is banished from the menu.  My heart stopped for a minute.  My hubby LOVES that salad.  In his words, it is his \"soul mate salad.\"  I can't even get him to eat a salad unless it is the BBQ chicken at Paradise.  It's gone!  How the heck am I ever going to get him to eat a salad again??

So I tell the girl that I have to go to the car to tell this unspeakable fact to my husband.  He was not happy!  He said we will never be coming back to Paradise ever again.  You have lost two very loyal customers because you can't seem to keep the same thing on the menu for any extended amount of time.  Does Paradise not understand that it is not a sustainable business model to change your menu every few months?  It gets really annoying when you find something you like, and the next time you stop in, nothing on the menu even resembles that item.  

Not only that, but the menu above the counter no longer has any descriptions of menu items.  What the heck is the Frontega Chicken sandwich?  I wouldn't know because the descriptions that used to be there are gone.  I shouldn't have to ask what every single sandwich consists of before I place my order.  

Venting session over.  Someone needs to go back to the drawing board at Paradise Bakery and fix what's broken."}
{"text":"I like Panera in other states so I keep coming back to see if this location improves and they are consistently awful. Tables sticky, coffee empty, bakery items mislabeled and 10 \" plates for 3\" items. Too bad - products not bad but lots of better options like Wildflower across the street. Maybe the Mgr should walk across the street to see what success looks like."}
{"text":"I could tell you how good the mac and cheese is here, but you wouldn't actually KNOW how good it is until you have it in your mouth. Panera's mac and cheese is the best thing i have ever ingested. I want to take it out to a nice seafood dinner, and then propose to is on a moonlit beach in Maui. I want it to never leave my mouth."}
{"text":"Great place for anytime of the day meals. The service was good, not the best. The sandwich was fresh, the bread was soft as it should be. Love the chicken noodle"}
{"text":"They have an acoustics problem here.  It's horribly loud in there, and everything feels rushed and crushed together.  I had some vegetarian sandwich, it was mediocre and gave me heartburn supreme.  Blah.  

Also there was an article on MSNBC that revealed that Panera uses additives in their bakery items that cause hyper activity in young children.  

So if you are looking for a place that's crowded, loud, has mediocre food and pocked with spastic, hyper active children who will gnaw on your leg, go here."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good.  They need to have a dedicated cashier ring you up. Management obviously doesn't get it. Customers don't like waiting to place an order over 5 minutes.   Then waiting another 5-10 minutes to get it prepared. Green valley location is much better."}
{"text":"Ordered a sausage egg and cheese sandwich and coffee to go. Got my sandwich fairly quick, get to work and it's only cheese and egg. Yuck. Had no time to obviously go back so I called the manager said he would refund my credit card but I was left hungry until lunch which is pretty frustrating. It was not that bust at the time either."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast. I was a little confused. I heard of Panera before, but had never been to one. This place said Paradise Bakery on the doors. The receipt said Panera. Wow, what an identity crisis!

I ordered a breakfast sandwich. Once I placed my order, I wasn't sure what to do. The cashier disappeared and someone else asked if I needed help. I explained that I ordered a sandwich and she said to wait and they would bring it out.

The sandwich was quite tasty. I really enjoyed the flavor. However, the packaging seemed a little extreme. The sandwich came in a cardboard box with a plastic window to view my breakfast. I don't know how recyclable cardboard with plastic is. It also came in a heavy duty bag with twine handles. Holy cow, I was just going to eat it in the courtyard, not take it on a 500 mile journey.

My summary
 - Tasty food
 - Who are they?
 - Environmentally unfriendly packaging."}
{"text":"I really want to like Panera Bread because I like the idea of it! It's convenient and they have healthier options. But everything I have tried tastes like a frozen microwaveable sandwich. Today I tried the Spinach Avocado Breakfast sandwich and it was extremely disappointing.  The bread was so soggy it was inedible. They didn't even bother to slice the avocado. It still had the hollow from the pit. And the black stem was still attached. Yuck!"}
{"text":"I usually like to go to \"Grand ma\" type bakeries for all my bread needs and avoid the chains but Panera Is an exception. It's hard to find yummy soup bread bowls these days atleast It Is in las vegas with all our hybrid dining options and ultra shic veggie spots. seems like theres no more room on the menu for carby bread but not Panera....Bread made fresh."}
{"text":"the food is always fresh and made correctly to order and I truly believe it's a result of the people that work up front they are amazing. however if your order is to go be ready to wait a while. once the order is placed and put on the screen awaiting for fulfillment the people in the back often spend more time talking about their personal lives and playing around then they do looking at the screen regularly. on multiple occasions I have had to clear my throat or asking if my order was ready for them to even realize that one has been placed before they even opted to look at the screen that notify them new orders are up. Despina is extremely convenient for me and typically has great customer service the management is wonderful and always very accommodating. however it's not somewhere I would recommend stopping if you're on a time crunch I have a shorter lunch break than usual. by the time they actually made your food even if you were the only customer in line good luck being able to get back to work on time and let alone sit down and enjoy your lunch."}
{"text":"Consistently great good, fast service, free wifi (although there is a time limit during peak hours). Always come back for the broccoli cheddar soup, grilled cheese, iced green tea, and kettle cooked chips. The manager is sometimes a little cold when interacting with customers, but it's nothing that deters me from returning."}
{"text":"This is a very lively Panera. There are middle school and high school kids here often. They don't really clean up after themselves so you do a little cleaning before you sit down it is alright. The employees are pleasant enough and the food is good. I love that Panera keeps their calories listed on the menu so that you can plan accordingly. Not my favorite location but still a good one!"}
{"text":"They have the best customer service 
In the SW area
I will recommend this place to anyone 
Make sure you Aaliyah and kaylee 
There are grate......"}
{"text":"Always love Panera.  I love getting their Pick 2 combo meal.  Free wireless internet.  Staff is friendly.  Food comes out quick.  Amazing sweet treats and their iced tea is one of my favorites.  Plenty of indoor seats, including an outside patio."}
{"text":"I am loving the new Panera app! This place has always given me great service and with the app it is even easier. I recently had an issue with an order and when I came in Nick gave me the best service possible. As someone who manages a medium sized company I can say that if he is not a manager, manager in training, or assistant manager, he should be."}
{"text":"I've lived nearby for more years than this location has existed, and have visited this location maybe 20 times. Unfortunately, 99% of Avondale restaurants fall victim to seamy clientele. They manage to entirely ruin most businesses around here. 

About 6 months ago, you were doing well to find your salad was made with all fresh ingredients. Then they started tasting  slightly more spoiled. Now my husband and I find they can't even get themselves together to sell us a pastry or smoothie."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why everyone gets so excited over this American chain. 

It's basically a step up from Timmy's. They \"bake\" (reheat frozen pre-baked)  there bread, and the soups are made from powder. 
 

Fast food calories, carefully glossed over with a \"home cooked\" illusion. 

Panera Bread touts artisan breads, hand-tossed salads and hearty sandwiches. With the hearty taste comes a hearty calorie load.

According to the nutritional values listed on the Panera Bread website, the following sandwich menu items have nutritional values of:

Frontega Chicken on Focaccia: 860 calories, 39 grams of fat

Smokehouse Turkey on Focaccia: 860 calories, 39 grams of fat

Tomato & Mozzarella on Ciabatta: 780 calories, 30 grams of fat

Turkey Artichoke of Focaccia: 750 calories, 27 grams of fat

Chipotle Chicken on Artisan French: 1070 calories, 55 grams of fat

Sierra Turkey on Focaccia w/Asiago Cheese: 970 calories, 54 grams of fat

These have more than double the amount of calories you may expect from an innocent little turkey sandwich. Panera Bread's nutrition page also lists the nutritional values should you only eat half the sandwich - but are you really only going to eat half the sandwich? Probably not. Unless you order a cup a soup- which they have many good options to choose from (just stay clear of any \"creamy\" soups).

I will give them an extra star, based on the fact that they were the first in its industry to post calorie information voluntarily at all company-owned cafes."}
{"text":"We ordered the New England chowder bread bowls, which were really good. The service was great.  Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Ordered the corn chowder in a bread bowl, which was pretty good.  Love the soups and seating. Service fast and friendly.  Would come back again to this location."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic with absolutely the best service!  Sign up for rewards card and earn free meals.  Parking at this location is a drag, I try to avoid the rush hours.  my favorite is the FUJI apple chicken substitute creamy dressing for vinaigrette. YUM."}
{"text":"Missing Paradise bakery... Panera shame on you! $12.79 got me a very small half of tuna salad sandwich and a palm sized  ceasar 3 microscopic  pieces of chicken salad oh and a faucet cup of water. The prices are ridiculous they even charge $2.49 for the cup of water because it's a regular cup! My son got mac and cheese meal it was literally 3 teaspoons spoons of  it He's 9 and he was like mom its so small He spent $5.69 for his bite sized meal and water! Even worse is the soggy paper box they put food in kinda like left over feel. Do not try this place it's not worth it.
Someone needs to re- train employees so they stop skimping on food."}
{"text":"This Panera location is just okay to me. 
The food is up to par with other Panera locations and the tables and bathrooms are kept clean. 
Some of the employees here are very helpful and friendly, whereas other ones seem like they hate their jobs and would rather be anywhere else.
I personally don't really mind as long as my food is made correctly, which most of the time, it isn't. I always order the same soup and salad with one adjustment (no cheese) at Panera, and I didn't think it was that complicated until I started coming here. I'm not sure why but they either leave the cheese on, or give me an entirely different salad. They have always been apologetic and fixed it right away which I appreciate, but it happens every single time we come in.
Overall, I would probably choose to go to another location instead of this one, just because they do mess up my order so much."}
{"text":"I used to go to this Panera every week since it was between work and my beach volleyball place!  The ambiance is very chill and perfect for laptop studying and work which is mostly what I did.  At the same time I kept of log of the things I ate and rated them... they change their menu all the time so some of this stuff might not be on their menu anymore.  Food is ok, coupled with the environment I give it 4.  Food alone probably 3.5.  Wifi not the fastest though which was only negative on the environment.

Name of item, rating (10 being highest), my comments.

Soups 
Cream of chicken wild rice, 8, The cooked wild rice adds a umami savoriness to the soup and feels like it dillutes a typically rich creamy soup.  The dillution is in no way a negative criticism but actually a compliment of an intelligent balance of flavors that makes this soup taste healthy yet satisfying.  It has a taste that most resembles the filling of a chicken pot pie.

French onion, 8, lots of cheese! Pretty good, not too salty, most french onions I find too salty croutons were a bit burnt, clearly a cheese bread in its previous life; only complaint is that its pretty greasy even for a french onion.  Thickness and texture is pretty good.  not too runny

Turkey Chilli (Signature), 8, Pretty good chili; turkey is not very plentiful but nice mixture of beans and veggies; lima beans, etc.

Garden vegetable with pesto, 6, Pesto taste is nice but not nice enough to mask the overcooked tomatos and acidity

Country mushroom (with truffle), 4, Can't describe the taste but not very pleasant.  

Vegetarian creamy tomato soup , 5, Panera is not capable of making tomato anything.  There I said it.  Taste is burnt.

Low fat chicken noodle soup, 7, Chicken chunks were better and were real 
chicken.  Less watery than last time but still watery... salty too.  Texture of all the ingredients was baby food level soft.  Still - ok soup.  It's chicken noodle after all.

Baked potato, 7, Tastes a little like clam chowder with potatos; bacon flavor helps to give it that baked potato feel

Sandwiches  
Sierra turkey sandwich, 8, good solid sandwich 

Fontina grilled cheese, 7, For those who like their grilled cheese greasy this is right up your ally.  Nothing special but cured meat is a nice touch though you'd almost expect it at the price!

Napa almond salad, 8, Nice springy salad task, sliced grapes are a nice touch, overall and pretty good.  Could have used less dressing; was a little watery and messy.

Asiago steak, 8, Pretty good sandwich.  Steak is well done.

Bacon turkey bravo salad, 8, Good sandwich.  Bread was especially good today; has some herbs like sundried tomato/roasted red pepper infused; honey mustard works well too and not overpowering

Smoked Turkey, 7, As regular as it can possible get.  I can make this in 2 minutes.  Nothing special about any of it.

Pasta  
Rigatoni san marzano, 7, The rigatona was well cooked and hard to the tooth.  Sauce was decent and not too runny.  Pretty good pasta dish.

Mac and Cheese, 6, Way to salty and too much cream - though the cream was watery.  Bearable with bread to dilute the 

Sides  
Baguette, 9, Their namesake is their strength.  Good healthy softness with just enough integrity and hardness to the outside.

Chips, 8, \"Kettle\" cooked chips.  Good solid chips for when you need that greasy sodium fix.

Drinks  
Chai Latte, 10, Not usually a latte fan, but this is super!  I don't order anything else.

Salads  
Mediterranian Cous cous Shrimp, 8, Panera's salads are always pretty tasty, this is no different; tangy and crisp; shrimp is nice; spinach and lettice mix with beans, cous, feta, and a few roasted red peppers and olives

Spinach power salad, 7, Too much dressing, was kind of soggy.  Probably due to the mushrooms.  Was ok taste, sweet and salty.  Bacon is always safe bet.  Only half an egg...kind of stingy?

Classic chicken, 7, Chicken with salad.  That's all.  

Panini  
Chipotle Chicken Panini, 7, Pretty good panini, nothing special; it's a bit spicy which is nice.  The bread wasn't grilled the same on both sides which was weird.  Overall decent taste.

Forcata Chicken Panini, 7, Bread was slightly burnt, but nothing to do with the sandwich.  Chicken was kind of tasteless and in chunks that were a bit too big.  Sandwhich was all over the place.  Mostly could only taste the cheese; tomato was nice if it stood out more... but it didn't"}
{"text":"Still amazing. Best service of any Panera in the country. Great, sunny, outdoor seating. I just love this place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Panera. Every time I go and meet someone somewhere, I choose Panera. Great food, always clean, quiet and comfortable atmosphere, and unlimited coffee! How could you not get excited about that?!? I'm rating this place a three star because they have all that except friendly staff. I've been going into this Panera for years now and for some reason every time I go in there, the managers seem over stressed and not polite; which then trickles down to the other staff around them. Again, I love everything about this place and will choose to still come here (mostly because it's closest to my home), but I will not rave about it in no means because of the staff being non-friendly. Often I find myself wanting to ask the managers...\"How are you doing?\" \"Are you okay?\" \"Everything alright?\" - But I'm not sure that would help. Honestly if there was a local coffee place that was open later and offered the same kind of idea, I would not go to Panera and endorse that coffee shop place."}
{"text":"Wow! Fantastic place! 1) Portions were great! 2) You can use the Ritual app and get rewards 3) the good is delicious AND healthy 4) bright spacious restaurant. This is the perfect take-out place for any busy healthy urban professional."}
{"text":"* Ridiculously fast service. 
* This restaurant is always busy, and it can be especially crowded during lunchtime! 
* The ordering lines are usually long, but they employ two cashiers to expedite orders.
* There is plenty of comfortable seating.
* This restaurant was always immaculate and the dirty tables are bussed quickly. 
* The staff at this particular location seems to be well trained. 
* Panera Bread has many healthy and delicious menu selections. 
* They have some nice breakfast sandwiches, muffins, and pastries; however, these items tend to disappear quickly.
* Their free wifi is greatly appreciated.
* I never had less than stellar meal at this location."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Had poor very slow service. I will not go back to this Panera. Seems to have gone down hill in the last six months."}
{"text":"Slowest moving Panera ever but nice people! Do not come to if your in a hurry! Next time I'll order online!"}
{"text":"My daughter is obsessed with the white Mac and Cheese. She will eat the first \"kids meal\" like nobodies business (~5) then wants more so I order her another small sized Mac and cheese thinking it might be $2-3... Nope $5! Really?$ maybe you should include a larger size. I thought Payne me ordering a Pick2 meal with my sandwich and her extra Mac n cheese would save me a few bucks but really the YouPick2 is about 4.75 per item...
No savings! 
My sandwich tonight was the Frontega. Pretty sure I just realized there weren't any basil or mayo as I read in the menu. Picture include"}
{"text":"After listening to the cooks complain about my order I receive it. I get it home and there's no dressing on my salad. The lettuce is brown, No feta cheese on my Greek salad. And the tomatoes have brown spots. No spinach on my bbq flatbread. I've always had really good service/ food here but this was a horrible experience. Manager did offer to refund money and was very apologetic. Only saving grace to this experience! 

Food 1/10
Service 3/10"}
{"text":"I meant to write this review sooner but it slipped my mind. I came here on a sluggish Monday morning I ordered a Spinach and Artichoke Quiche. I'm not a big Quiche fan but Panara is the only place I'll eat a Quiche from, they make it in a croissant, it's so buttery and delicious, definitely worth more than the 5$ they charge for it, it's that good! Their honey wheat Loaf is the bomb too, I make a great French toast with it ...Omar at the Register on a Monday morning Is such a breath of fresh air, he makes such great suggestions and is the one who put me on to the spinach and Artichoke quiche, he even made sure to give me a fresh one that just came out of the oven OMG Amazing! Omar also has such a great sense of humor and really made my Monday feel like a Friday! I wish everyone is as funny as Omar on any given day....thanks for making my week special! Way to go Panera bread!"}
{"text":"If you sign up for their MyPanera card and register it online, you get a free drink/coffee! So ask for a card!
 I love panera, I just don't know how I end up spending $10 on half a sandwich and a bagel
    butttt, their bagels are totally worth it :)"}
{"text":"LOVE THE DRIVE THROUGH!!! YAY this is a great location for Panera, wide open parking lot, easy access, and a huge comfy space inside. I am thrilled, now I have another option other than McDonald's or Sheetz!"}
{"text":"Only reason why this Panera is missing a star is because this one is always busy, and I feel like it gets packed fast. I am spoiled now because of the new location right by my house, however, this one is near the mall and all my other shopping. I think parking is also quite hectic over hear too. Pulling a left of out here is a hassle, but a right not too bad. I enjoy this Panera over Middleburg but I love my new North Ridgeville location. I was telling the cashier about that one and how it has a drive through and she was shocked. haha :)"}
{"text":"Holy crap this Panera is always packed, but the bagels are soo good! I just can't believe when I get lunch, how pricey it is for the little amount of food. I mean I guess it's a nice treat every once in a while, I just don't think it's worth the money. I just go here for my cinnamon crunch fix!"}
{"text":"This Panera is supppper nice but I think the drive thru concept doesn't work. If your behind someone who has a lot or complicated order you will be stuck foreverrrrr. I ordered a drink and pastry and waited 9 min. I should of just went to Starbucks. If you have the time to wait...go for it!"}
{"text":"Never had issues with Panera restaurants until I visited the one located by the mall. My order was about 15 mins apart. The kitchen seemed like they didn't care to speed up the line knowing it was getting busy. But there was a nice girl that was at the register who apologized and tried getting the rest of my order, which I did like."}
{"text":"Went to this location to treat a family member and hadn't been to one of their stores in a few years. Was sorely disappointed with the soup and sandwiches we were served and the prices for what was more like fast food quality was outrageous. The soup tasted liked it came from a can and the sandwich which was small, had hardly anything on it. I had ordered a steak and cheddar, and the alleged steak was just like steak-umms and had a glop of cheese-like substance on it with no flavor. It was also very greasy. Upon leaving, I ordered a loaf of the asiago bread and we were pleased with that. Seems only the bakery has survived. Will not return to this place for anything but their bakery, but since my business that takes me in the area is moving, I won't make the extra trip for just bread."}
{"text":"Nice location, large eating area. Very friendly staff and always, food came out fast. Wasn't too thrilled with the roast beef sandwich however. Even with the horseradish which must've been the weakest stuff around, it was a bland sandwich. I've had other sandwiches at other locations that were much better so I'm not saying this location sucks, it's just this particular day, this sandwich sucked!
Tomato bisque (creamy they called it) was tasty, wasn't really hot enough. Good thing for the incredible baguette to save the day!"}
{"text":"Extremely bad customer service, employees are idiots... The food is trash, Michelle the so called supervisor is horrible, she has no common sense and should go back to some basic customer service, people training.  This place makes Panera look bad. If you are here, go to Popeyes or Burger King.  The food is trash, not like other Panera's."}
{"text":"I'm only speaking of, and rating, their delivery service. The drivers deliver healthy generous servings, while providing excellent customer service. I especially like that they deliver FAST."}
{"text":"I said in an earlier post that I would never be back- I should have taken my own advice! I stopped here because I wanted to go to chick fil a but the line was too long (deservedly so)
This place has become even worse than it was at the time of my previous post, if you can even believe that. Slow service, prices have gone up- and have the absolute nerve to ask for a tip when this is the filthy table , debris on the floors and tables, absolutely disgusting. The irony- \"clean\" eating in a filthy establishment!!!!
This time I WILL take my own advice and NEVER return! Just horrible! I hate that I had to even give one star, it should be minus 5"}
{"text":"Like everyone else, we REALLY wanted to like this place.

Like mostly everyone else, we used to go to Paradise Bakery at Alma School and Queen Creek at least once each week. 

Have been here 4 times now. Here's the skivy:
- if u do go, sit outside on the cute patio, enjoy the yummy baked goods and coffee house music and have a regular cup of coffee.
- the above is actually a great experience

If u decide to eat inside, u will be there with folks with oxygen tanks and families with crying babies...and the inside decor reminds us of a Residence Inn or Denny's...ok but not cool.

If u order a latte it will be better than Paradise but not even close to as good as Starbucks...just get a regular cup of coffee or go somewhere else.

I go to Starbucks EVERY weekday...tried coming here but frankly I miss the ultra friendly, cool, professional guys at Starbucks....so back to Starbucks .

So if u want to bike over and enjoy the cool patio experience with coffee/orange scone, go for it...it's fun. Otherwise, u have lots of better options."}
{"text":"Convenient location, off the strip. Plenty of parking,  Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Staff are friendly and extremely attentive.  Free coffee refills, plenty of plugs, free and strong Wifi, makes it very competitive to Starbucks, with the advantage of a broad menu.  Decent frequent buying program."}
{"text":"Let me start your saying I do love Panera. BUT this location can't get a rapid pick up order correct to save its life. There is always something missing or wrong and they argue with you instead of just fixing the issue. It should be noted we have no dined in since the switch from paradise. We've only done the online order to go."}
{"text":"This Panera has had quite a turnover in staff since my last review in 2013, but that's because the young men and women who work here are college-age and are naturally headed for bigger and better things. During their time here, though, they are friendly and efficient, due in part to the very competent managers and shift supervisors.

Last week, this Panera was slammed with a HUGE lunch crowd (possibly some big event at the college campus across the street?) with customers  lined up out the door. The Panera team just kicked into overdrive and I didn't hear one complaint from the customers. They saw that the supervisors and manager jumped into help and that each and every worker was working as speedily as possible.

Kudos to the entire team for a job well done!"}
{"text":"This 2000th Panera opened on 3/23/16, but it is already showing its fine heritage by echoing the high quality food and friendly, well-trained staff of previous Panera restaurants. This is a great place to come for quick, delicious food and drinks, but it is also a fun place to meet friends and spend a couple of hours drinking coffee and playing on your computer."}
{"text":"Nice remodel. Comfortable atmosphere. Very average food. Bland sandwich. No taste. Panera is a disappointment."}
{"text":"I usually love Panera Bread franchises, and I am a loyal customer back home. But for this one on the Boulevard of the Allies, I have to give a thumbs down. Four outlets for customer use in the whole place??? That is both sad and bad in this age of mobile devices. The Panera over on Forbes is much more savvy...even installing extra outlets in the floor. Get with the program, Allies Panera!"}
{"text":"This morning at breakfast there, the hallway to the bathroom was crammed with kitchen equipment and highchairs and I couldn't get my wheelchair down there to use the restroom.  I told the manager that was against the law and she said they were waiting for a shipment of some kind in the kitchen. I asked her what that had to do with me being denied access to the restroom? She apologized but could not answer my question."}
{"text":"Me and my friend were here yesterday AUG 10th around 11am and we think its the Cleanest panera we have ever been to just about spotless and the food was pretty good also just the cashier was rude."}
{"text":"When did Panera take such a horrific nose dive? I used to like this chain - quality ingredients, everything was fresh... somewhere along the way they stopped caring.

I dropped by for a quick lunch after a hair appt at the salon next door. I was starving. Took more than 15 minutes for a simple to-go order (no changes, completely on menu) of a turkey sandwich with an apple side and a bowl of broccoli cheddar soup with a baguette. And no, the store wasn't busy.

When I got home and opened the bag, I found a rotted apple - I'm talking visibly rotted, not just bruised, with an oozing spot and dents all over the rest of the fruit. So I sat that aside. Unwrapped the sandwich and it was sloppily assembled and WET. I mean the turkey was a sickly gray color and I could've wrung it out it was so soggy. It was disgusting and inedible and I fear very likely could've made me sick.

The soup and bread, if you're wondering, were fine but certainly nothing to write home about and definitely not worth the price.

I complained to Panera and they didn't even bother to apologize. Instead, they said they'd send me a \"treat\" which, after I questioned the further, was $10 on the Panera rewards card I don't even have. $10 towards a $20+ purchase of rotted food. Here's a hint: an apology for serving someone slop can go a long way. Pretend you care. It's the polite thing to do.

Panera has a lot to learn about customer service and food quality. I suggest some training for your staff and maybe a colorful chart detailing what an apple should look like. I mean, I should'n't have to tell you that turkey isn't meant to look like waterlogged insulation but hey, maybe your carelessness will cause an epidemic and the health dept will explain it to you in words you can understand - namely \"FAIL\"."}
{"text":"Good Food, Good Coffee.  And you can get a genuine ceramic mug, very civilized!"}
{"text":"Slow.... Always out of breads needed for certain dishes.   No panera should run out of a bread type on catering before they even open for the day.   Menu items should be able to be fulfilled in a timely manner.  Sad :("}
{"text":"I love Paradise Bakery and have done so for years but, the location on Signal Butte and Baseline is notorious for having terrible service, lack of staff and rudeness to be blunt. We just left the location after standing in a line of 2 people for over 5 minutes. We were being totally ignored at the soup bar after having our salads made. Even the manager ignored us! 
If you want a quick enjoyable meal, I would do the same as us.... Drive across the parking lot to 'Rubios' where they greeted us with a warm friendly smile and couldn't be happier to take our order promptly."}
{"text":"Is there a way to put 0 stars . This place NEVER has bread bowls like WTF this is what you're designed for . The fat baker Bitch needs to order more supply  because I'm seriously not happy . Every time i try to eat dinner here THEY NEVER have bread bowls and it's not even late it's fuckin 7:30 ! I'm OVER it . The owner or the manager needs to stop being fuckin cheap and order enough food for the ENTIRE DAY"}
{"text":"Very rude management! 

I placed an order through the app for Rapid Reward pickup.  Gave 1/2 hr notice for pickup at specific time.  At that time my order wasn't on the shelves. Okay.  Things happen.  I went to the area where they dispense orders and told a management person that my order wasn't there.  She rudely replied that it was on the shelves.  I replied that it wasn't.  Then she notched up her rudeness level and told me that I probably ordered it from the wrong store. I contained all of my rage as she walked away from me.  She came back with my order and said \"It was on the counter.\"  Meaning the \"Panera behind the scenes counter\" - not somewhere I could find it.  No apology. No smile. No nothing.  I understand that they were busy but there's no call for rudeness.  And from someone in management!"}
{"text":"Catering service horrible. Zero stars! If I could give no stars I would...but not an option. Presentation made to 15 hungry people. Order placed in advance for the lunch. Food suppose to be here an hour ago. No one will answer phones, no food has been delivered, no phones answered at corporate offices. DO NOT USE THE CATERING SERVICE IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT FOOD DELIVERED."}
{"text":"I had the Italian sandwich. It had a good balance of meat, cheese and dressing. The bread was fresh and tasty, with a crisp crust. The lemonade tasted good too. It was a pleasant all around experience."}
{"text":"Oh, I like Panera. I love their you pick two combos. Awesome grilled cheese and tomato soup and desserts. It's a nice place to hang out while you're waiting for your car to get inspected."}
{"text":"Twice now they have \"forgotten\" my order. I've had to wait an extra 10 minutes to get it. Won't be back. I work in this mall and won't be referring people there."}
{"text":"Update: still lovin this Panera. Rapid pick up is the bomb!"}
{"text":"I ordered a breakfast sandwich. My spouse finished his breakfast already and still waiting on mine. A good 5-10 minutes go by when a worker comes by and says they are out of croissants. On a Saturday morning?? Then said workers asks if I want something else or money back. I said money and he presses me getting into something else so fine I'll get a muffin. Then he only returns a few dollars a not the  full breakfast sandwich cost. Seems shady as he was pushing for me to get something else basically implying it would be on the house due to inconvenience of waiting on then and not having the product ordered. Guess what, cornerstone cafe is right around the corner about to open- I'll go there instead."}
{"text":"You never go wrong with Panera Bread. I actually like their sandwich.
I don't know why people have problems with Chain restaurants.
I can go there for lunch everyday."}
{"text":"Can't really go wrong with Panera Bread. I got pasta to go because I had a reward."}
{"text":"Felt like having a sandwich for lunch and ended up leaving. The service was horrible. These people act like it is such a chore to do their job. The staff didn't care and made us feel like we were burdening them to have to check us out. I honestly felt like walking out and leaving everything there. I don't know if it was my experience that day or if the food was just blah."}
{"text":"Meh. Every time I go here, I regret it because I somehow end up paying $10 for a half sandwich and small salad. A meal I can make myself for a couple bucks. None of them stand out to me either. I've had good experiences here with the staff but they were out of the sandwich I've ordered on more than one occasion. The silver lining is Panera encourages me to just be an adult and buy my own produce and meat."}
{"text":"They did not honor the veterans day special.  The \"manager\" did not receive and email.  I told her it was on the web site. She did not look.  DO NOT GO HERE.  CORPORATE: Get a new staff and train them.  I will not be going back. Went 3 times and every time there is an issue.  They don't have a clue about filling orders and have horrible customer service."}
{"text":"My sweet husband went to pick me up some chicken noodle soup and bread because I have been sick all week. We ordered two soups, bread, Mac n cheese, and two cookies. (The restaurant was out of bread bowls, which was a real letdown.) What was completely ridiculous was how we ended up with a bunch of random soups, no bread and no cookies. It was as if the people at Panera weren't even trying to get our order right. What a disappointment. We certainly won't be going back to Panera again."}
{"text":"Called to pick up lunch for co workers and myself and Kimberly took my call and was extremely nice and helpful! She did mention she was new but she did GREAT and was very patient. I did end up missing one of my soups BUT I called and Daniel said he would have it delivered which they did and added some goodies. Keep being friendly and having that bubbly personality Kimberlyyou don't see that a lot nowadays and thank you Daniel for having that delivered! Great customer service"}
{"text":"I used to out for Sunday breakfasts with my ex when our schedules allowed it.  One thing I still do for myself is go out for breakfast and get my car washed.  I normally go to local places.  On my cross country trip my brother and I went to Panera and I had the four cheese soufflé. I have been thinking about this for about two weeks.

This Sunday I decided to go to Panera.  I don't normally think of this as a place for breakfast, but I am definitely adding this one into my rotation. Seriously the four cheese soufflé is to die for. I went to another location and they were out. Vi called ahead the first time I called I got hung up on immediately. That cost a star...sorry! Second time I got Kristy, she saved me the last soufflé they sell out fast! I got lucky.  I ordered an orange scone.  Very tasty. And a latte again very tasty. Service was good too.  The pastries are beautiful, I'll have one of each. 

Panera not just for sandwiches."}
{"text":"Service was nice, the set up is great for a quick lunch in a hurry. The apple slices were rotten with both of our lunch combos, but the Pick-2 combos were good aside from the fruit."}
{"text":"Ordered an everything bagel with veggie cream cheese. They said they are out of cream cheese except for plain. The plain cream cheese is not Panera's cream cheese but a generic looking cream cheese called Hahn's. And they charged me for it! $1.30. Really Panera? The last time I was there they didn't have the cream cheese I wanted either. And they screwed up our order by shorting us a bagel."}
{"text":"Ah Panera! Always loved Panera but for some reason this location was a let down. The pastry I had which was the same I get from other Panera's was a bit dry. The coffee is as good and fresh as ever. The service? well, their cashiers need a bit more education about their menu and also needs to clean up their counter spaces just a little bit better. I'll give them another try being that it's the location closest to me. Don't let me down next time Panera at Boca Park."}
{"text":"I liked to hide here between classes @ Pitt.

PROS:
Free WiFi;
Great food;
Great pastries;
nice staff;
clean

CONS:  
CRAZY busy between 11:30 and 1pm (lunch rush is nuts here!)
Parking  (either street on Forbes or surrounding or the Sennott Square garage underneath the building, but the garage is busy after 9:30am)


As for the \"takes reservations\" question, they have a room that you can rent out for meetings and anything--but that's the only reservations they take.
Phone/Fax Order are a \"can do\" here."}
{"text":"This one's a decent Panera to visit.

Always clean, the staff has always been friendly and the food follows the Panera guidelines/standards as the others do.

Bathrooms are clean, Tables in this location are plentiful.

If you're smart--you'll avoid this place from 11:30-1:30 at all costs.  All Paneras are Stupid-Busy during the lunch rush!

{"text":"I ordered the steak and cheddar! Well, when I finally got to the steak it was pretty good. However, I got about 2.5 bites that had steak on it. Also, I've never ordered food, going through a drive thru, where the bread isn't wrapped. The bread sat on top of my order receipt that had pink highlighter written all over it. I find that unsanitary. This was my first time going there and I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Accidentally ordered a rapid pickup to the wrong store and they accommodated with no questions asked. Great customer service."}
{"text":"This place is over rated! Can't figure why I paid $9.44 for a bowl of soup with a bun. Never coming back again ."}
{"text":"For there being no one in front of me the food took unusually long to prepare in comparison to other Panera's I visit across the country. 
Once the food came out, the Chipotle Chicken Avocado Melt and Autumn Squash soup, I observed it. 
The sandwich seemed thinner than usual and there were no seed on top or inside of the soup. 

The real reason I'm writing this review is because of DIRTY SILVERWARE!!! The spoon looked like it hadn't been washed since the last person used it. 

Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm really tasty salad. I would come back to eat this salad again. But the sandwich was only okay. I would choose something different. Have a look at my picture. I had the south west chile salad and a turkey kale panini. I went before 11AM and it wasn't too packed. However if you want to try their soups, you will need to show up after 11AM."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely infatuated with the \"Rapid Pick-up\" process. It's not only fast but accurate. To be able to just walk in past the huge line EVERY TIME and find mi food waiting in its little cubby... Magical. Oh yeah, the food is great also. Not super cheap but I... Do... Not... Care."}
{"text":"Their soups are delicious, however, the way they prepare sandwiches in this location is atrocious. The bread is soggy, cheese is not even melted, and portions are minuscule for what you pay. I suggest going else where."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and to do some Studying & Work.  A friend of mine highly recommended this place because of the relaxed atmosphere and FREE Wifi.  I've passed it 100's of times and have never been here.  This was my first visit.

Since it was lunchtime, I was hungry and ordered the Italian Combo Sandwich with Kettle Chips & a Bottle of Water.  The menu is simple and you don't get to pick the toppings of your Sandwich....so that was a bummer to me....I like to select my toppings.  Oh well, no big deal.  On a positive note....they post the # of calories for each menu item....that was helpful....1,040 calories for my Sandwich + 180 Calories for the Chips....I was at 1,220 for the meal...not bad.

The place is a Bakery and had a ton of fresh Bread & Pastries....all very tempting, but I didn't want to pass out from food coma....I had to get some work and homework done.

I settled into a small table and setup the wireless on my laptop while I waited for my food.  It didn't take long and the food was ready.  I dove into the Sandwich....the Bread was pretty good and the proportion of Meat and toppings was good too.  It was good, but not great.

After lunch I moved over to a plush chair in the corner and got to work....got some work done and hung out for a couple of hours.  It was very comfortable.

Will I return?  I think I found a new place to add to my FREE Wifi work rotation....of course!"}
{"text":"My mother in law came by and dropped off breakfast and an iced vanilla latte from Panera Bread this morning. I ordered the asiago bagel with egg, cheese and bacon. 

The sandwich was okay but the coffee was so sweet, I could barely drink it. 

Now I know to not go to Panera for breakfast and coffee."}
{"text":"The quality....and everything varies here.
Can't guarantee clean floors. Sandwiches are different every time I get one. 
Service is mostly positive.
Also, there's a big hump in the floor - see if you can find it!"}
{"text":"Family of 5, we spent 93 bucks here. The service was not great; the chicken in the sandwich was gross (tasted old) the roasted beets were shrivelled."}
{"text":"Not the best experience at a Panera I've had. Stopped by for lunch with my wife and ... Out of apples? Apples keep forever, how do you run out? I then had to wipe down a table for us to sit at (the location is rather busy at lunch but not kept up all that well). I had ordered a soup and sandwich, and after a long wait got an apologetic kitchen runner telling me they were out of the soup I ordered (still showing on the menu) and would I like to select another.  I selected the tomato soup instead and it came out not hot and too salty, though otherwise good flavor.  If I'd had a better experience this might be a go-to lunch place since I live around the corner, but this was not my first mediocre visit."}
{"text":"I ordered a chipotle chicken avocado melt and southwest Chile lime chicken salad. It also came with a French baguette. The meal was VERY rich in flavor. You could just taste every flavor that existed!! Very good"}
{"text":"Not much to say about Panera Bread that people don't already know.  That's actually a good thing because it means that this chain has a standard that they are keeping. The standard is consistent throughout the chain and you can always depend on a high quality of product in each store.   I particularly like this Ballantyne store because the staff is so nice to my 83 year old mother, who joins a morning group of senior friends there as much as she is able.   The staff dotes on her and makes her feel special. That gives a warm, down home feeling to the place.  Today I had the chicken noodle soup and the fuji salad.  Both were good. I don't remember them asking what I wanted for a side item (I would have ordered an apple), but that sumptuous bread appeared on my plate. How could I refuse to eat that?   I dipped it into my soup and it was really good.   The salad was very good too - especially with the sweet dressing that comes on the side.  It's easy to be a big fan of Panera Bread for a lot of reasons.  It's a good thing, because they have popped up on almost every corner in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This has be the largest Panera Bread I've been to; seating isn't an issue here. The food was traditional Panera with the great bread and the prices were the same. Service was quick and easy."}
{"text":"Just bought a 1/2 chicken Cobb avacodo salad to go.  When I got home and took a good look at the salad which cost $5.99, I immediately thought it was overpriced.  The salad contained a couple of pieces of the core part of the lettuce that was uneatable.  I threw those away thinking \"I paid $5.99 for this?\" The container of salad dressing should have been bigger for the size of the salad.  The dressing was good, but the salad would have tasted better with slightly more dressing.  Otherwise, everything was fresh.  I called the  restaurant to make sure I was charged the right price for what I received.  I was told  I was charged correctly.  Based on this first experience with ordering a Panera half salad, I won't make that mistake again.  If you decided to go that route, make sure you  pay close attention to your order before you leave the restaurant."}
{"text":"This place went from good to just bad! Their prices went up and their portions got smaller and they have gotten our order wrong I don't know how many times. My most recent visit I ordered a salad and when I got home and opened it, the lettuce was old and it just looked disgusting."}
{"text":"I came here 5 days a week for 4 weeks to study for one of my board exams. Which may explain my review. I got to know the staff and the other regulars here. Everyone is real nice, down to earth, and curious about you. The service is good and quick, occasionally I would be waited on which is unusual at Panera. The food was good but its a chain so it can't be fantastic. I would recommend the chipotle chicken, sierra turkey, chicken noodle soup, black bean soup, toritilla soup, and the grilled chicken salad. I was never a fan of their breads. It is a nice cafe like environment to study tho.

Unfortunately I am no longer in the area and won't return there, but I would go back to visit another Panera."}
{"text":"There hasn't been a time where  I went to Panera bread and not been satisfied with what I've got. Not far from the strip on flamingo and paradise. Today I got the Fuji apple salad with chicken. Only 570 calories and 29 grams of protein. My new favorite salad"}
{"text":"I've been here several times during lunch (I work just around the corner), and am always impressed.  The rewards card is outstanding- nothing makes my day more than when they tell me I have a free drink or free pastry waiting for me!  I've tried multiple bagels, sandwiches, and salads and always been impressed.  Having the calories posted right on the items is also fantastic for those of us who want to know what we're putting into our bodies.

My only complaint is that their menu is exceedingly high in salt content, but it's hard to find a restaurant that isn't these days.  Definitely 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I used to love Paradise Bakery, but I don't care for the changes Panera has made. The straw that broke the camels back is that they are getting rid of my favorite salad (southwest chicken Caesar). It's time to change to Kneaders!"}
{"text":"It's fast food in a healthy mask. The price is right. The menu is not spectacular, but in a hurry, you'll feel much better about your decision than if you were to grab a Big Mac from McDonald's. 

The Mediterranean Vegetable sandwich is really delightful, the tomato soup is good, and the salads are fresh and well portioned. 

However, the broth bowls are definitely over seasoned. 

I must say, the service at this location is ALWAYS 5-star, even if the food is not."}
{"text":"Been here after a break in between visits and I remembered this place to be good! Got the choose two option with the steak panini which is litterally two bites and ur done, a joke of a panini with a blob of steak and mustard out of all sauces out there! Meh. The salad was also really sour and unnapetizing and with chunks of cold pieces of chicken ! Never again!"}
{"text":"No one is friendly here. Seating area had not been cleaned. Tired of getting tomatoes like this--unripe with big hunks of yellow green that aren't edible. Are the employees told just put them on the sandwiches instead of discarding them?"}
{"text":"I used to work for Panera Bread, not at this location, and I used to be so obsessed with it. Back then, 7 years ago, I enjoyed the 5.99 U-pick 2. (I didn't even mind paying the full price after I used up my employee discount) Even when they raised it up for 6.99 a year later, I considered it to be worth it.
Our family got stationed over seas for 3 years, before they raised it at 7.99. For me, I thought, heck I'd pay for that, it will be worth it.  Within that 3 years, there's no Panera Bread around. I've missed it and craved it ever now and then. Came back last year and relieved to have Panera back in my life. Although, I didn't go as often as I did before, and when I do, I would just grab my favorite sandwich (Bravo) and a cup of soup. Never disappointing. I never did pay attention to the prices either.
Today, I ordered a U-Pick2 at this Location as a Rapid Pick up, (which to my surprise they started that and delivery, that's a plus). 
Anyways, my main complaint: When did they start downsizing their portion? My half salad looks like a quarter size of the salad I used to get. 
The packaging looks nice, that's a thumbs up.
More Tea selections, another thumbs up. Super yummy btw.
Oh and staffs here are friendly, so thumbs up to them. (They did forgot my cup of soup though, but fixed that right away.)
I guess something has to give and that's the portions you buy with the money you spend. For this size salad and a cup of soup, I spent about $10. I'm beginning to think this isn't as worth it as it did before. 
I think I'll go to Kneaders for my salads for now on, at least there, i get a good portion for the money I spend."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY IF YOU ARE PLACING A CORPORATE CATERING ORDER! Beyond terrible customer service and unprofessional catering manager, Jen. It starts from the top and trickles down when it comes to management and how you play an example of a good customer service. I placed an order online last minute due to a last min request, I went ahead and placed the order, called into the cafe and asked if there was any way they could honor an earlier delivery time than what was given online. The answer was a hard NO, not a let me see if we can try since we are so busy, or any thing attempting to accommodate the request but I understood. An hour later, i get a phone call from Jen, the manager who tells me not only are they NOT going to honor the 12:45-1pm window I selected online but they were possibly going to get it into me by 1:30. I was very irritated at this point because had I known it was going to be even later, earlier in the morning when I placed the call, I would have ordered from another deli that I normally call and they always seem to be able to help me. At 1pm I then get a call from the \"\"Manager\" Jen again, when she mentions that she managed to get our order in by 12:48 exactly and I answered \"oh wow thank you for getting it in earlier than you had anticipated\". She answered back, \"Yeah so we did and just to let you know, we are never going to take an order from you again, we will not honor your orders\". She claims I yelled at her and I didn't. I was actually very monotone, but to say I sounded, unhappy and completely dis-satisfied, ABSOLUTELY. There were so many things wrong with my experience from the moment i attempted to have them accommodate me for my order. The worst of it all was the way in which she went out of her way to still deliver it and ban me. To say this was unprofessional and grossly personal is an understatement. I called corporate and wrote an email. I have gone to the extent of writing this so that others are forewarned on how TERRIBLE this store is managed. If you want a store that will partner with you when you need the catering service, this is NOT IT. When you need last minute requests because that is part of the customer service aspects, this store is not it. Luckily we have more options in Ballantyne, this will not be it for me."}
{"text":"I usually never have anything to complain about at this restaurant, but this is kind of ridiculous... I ordered a Greek salad with EXTRA dressing in the side.. I revived one dressing that was filled about a quarter of the way.. very disappointed...

{"text":"Paid $10.26 for processed grilled cheese sandwich and an apple. Rent must be very expensive here. Barista was condescending. Ugh."}
{"text":"This is the friendliest Panera I've ever visited... Not that the other stores aren't friendly, but these guys (and ladies) are extremely cordial and I love it here... 

I tried the Broccoli Cheddar soup about 3 years ago and until they were out the other day, that is the only soup I had even tried because I love it so... Who knew the Black Bean Soup and French Onion were also out of sight? lol  No one told me, but I'm glad I figured it out... The new turkey wheatberry salad was meh, in my opinion, but that is not the fault of this establishment... That's just my odd tastebuds... (I tried with the gorgonzola... Really, I did.)

I've never had a problem with a call in order (which I do a lot when I'm feeling lazy or don't have time to cook) and even if you do have to wait for everything to be prepared, it still doesn't take a long time..."}
{"text":"Over a year ago at Panera's District location, I had ordered a breakfast sandwich and was immediately displeased when I found a long hair in the middle of it. I didn't complain about this one, I instead just stopped frequenting altogether. 

It had been a year since I had gone, so I decided to pick up lunch at this location, since it's really close to where I work. After a year, you would think I wouldn't be unlucky enough to encounter this SAME problem. Unfortunately, as I was dipping the baguette into the soup, I go to pull it out and guess what I find? A HAIR. Fml, right? 

You can bet me giving this establishment another chance is over. Panera, please make it a requirement for your employees to wear the proper hair net/hazmat suit."}
{"text":"Avoid the salads. What a rip off. If you get a salad that mentions a specific ingredient in the title you probably will see the tiniest amount of it. My chicken cob with avocado salad had the most depressing amount of avocado like.. 1/6th of the avocado.. One small crumble of bacon and two thing strips of chicken.

The same situation happened the last visit. With the Mediterranean chicken quinoa salad. 
A teaspoon of quinoa and two lovers of chicken.
What a complete joke.

I'd be OK if I could just go to a different location and have a better experience but happens in all the Paneras I go to...


The Italian combo was great, on the bright side."}
{"text":"Every time we come to eat at this location they're always out of bread bowls, can someone take care of this pls pls pls pls."}
{"text":"Terrible service!

We called in an order for pick up and every single thing was wrong. 
No chicken on salad, cold grilled cheese, no dressing for salads, bad avocados. 

Terrible service and food."}
{"text":"Love panera but this is a bad location... staff is nice but we had all burnt baguettes and my friend had the cheese paper still on her sandwich.."}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday around 1030am they were out of most of there bagels.  Their toaster was down so they heated it on a press poor choice came out hot like it was microwaved.  Coffee had a brew time of 9:15 however it was really bitter tasting by the time I got to it.  I requested a refund,  and they lost me as a customer.  I won't be returning to many other places for bagels in a big city like Phoenix."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful experience and it was all because of the manager Christopher; he was kind, courteous, and humorous!  We will definitely be visiting this Panera again!"}
{"text":"I was super excited about the picture of the chipotle chicken avocado melt. Got back to the office and there's NOTHING IN IT! Ok there might be one tablespoon of chicken, and 1/8 of an avocado, I think there's cheese in there, but it's super scant. Really disappointed. It's not worth the 5.39 I just paid for half a sandwich that looks like it's got 1/2 the ingredients missing. I love that they don't put a lot of preservatives and crap in their food, but come on, you can't honestly serve this as half a sandwich. I'm going to Kneaders from now on. Now THAT'S half a sandwich. I always have leftovers because I can't eat the whole half. I only gave it two stars because the mac and cheese side was actually good. Not worth $11.10 that's for sure. I didn't even get a drink."}
{"text":"So helpful! I ordered online for \"rapid pick-up\" and it wasn't on the shelf just yet so they walked it out to me and made sure I had everything. Thanks guys you made a late night trip for food easy and delicious"}
{"text":"The sweet bread was really good, we head never eaten here so we decided to order a sandwich... It wasn't that good, the bread was really hard and couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"I am not a Panera regular. A friend and I stopped in for lunch today and I was pleasantly surprised. Arriving at noon, it was very busy. The employees worked well together taking orders and minimizing the line. 

We both ordered soup and a sandwich. I had the cream of chicken and wild rice, recommended by the helpful man who took our order, and she had the broccoli cheddar. Our food arrived to our table steaming within minutes. The fresh baguette topped it off perfectly. 

It was a quick, delicious lunch for under $20. I will be visiting more often!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this Panera. I am occasionally sent to work at a location that is near this particular one, and I remember when it was closed for the transition between Paradise Bakery into Panera. They have always had good customer service in my eyes, and adding the 5 Kiosks to the front is very efficient when you want to skip the line. I've never had a problem with their food either."}
{"text":"This store embodies customer service. I ordered the Pick 2 and had it delivered for convenience. Once I got my delivery I realized that the dressing for my salad was the wrong dressing. I called to let them know and they were very apologetic. I wasn't expecting much out of it, I just wanted to let them know and wanted to see if I could drop by and get the correct dressing. A couple of minutes later, they  arrived at the front desk of my work to drop me off not just the salad dressing, but a completely new salad as well.

This Panera location definitely goes above and beyond to make sure that their customers are getting treated right!"}
{"text":"I love the staff here! They are always so nice and process your order quickly! I love all of their salads especially the chicken caesar. The bonus is the free wifi so I can catch up on my work while enjoying lunch. This is hands down my favorite lunch spot!!"}
{"text":"Asked for my Sierra turkey to be grilled but I guess that's too hard to Remember. And only one cashier now? WHY ARE YOU SO CHEAP PANERA"}
{"text":"I ate at Panera Bread frequently when I lived in the North Dakota/Minnesota area.  It was easily my favorite of the chain restaurants.  The one here in Phoenix just opened a few blocks away from work.  I gave it a few weeks just to be sure that I didn't run into the messy opening crowd.  I finally went in this morning for brunch.  I ordered the asiago steak sandwich, which is one of my favorites.  This iteration was pretty bad by comparison.  The bread was very dry and chewy.  It scraped up the roof of my mouth.  I realize that this kind of asiago sourdough has a chewy texture, but this was beyond unacceptable.

I still give it two stars because the lady at the register was pretty awesome.  Plus, they have some really delicious bagels and pastries.  I'm not sure what it's called, but there is a cinnamon crunch style bagel that is one of most delicious I have ever tried.

I'll try them again, but I'm probably going to wait a few more weeks."}
{"text":"Good natured staff who deal with our shenanigans! Willing to custom make a Caesar salad sandwich that used to be on the menu for my wife. It's the small things. Smart workers were also trying to make life easier for us while making us smile in the process.
Thanks for the laughs guys!"}
{"text":"Dirty Dirty Dirty.... the reason it takes so long to get your food is they allow their employees to pull out their phones and play around. Dirty restaurant... food everywhere on the floors. Rude young people working. I'm done with this store.."}
{"text":"Panera is always an easy choice when I want a quick sandwich, salad, or soup, but I especially love coming here in Summer because the strawberry poppyseed salad is my favorite!  The only drawback...Pepsi products!  Good thing their iced tea is fresh."}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard Panera with tasty soups and fresh salads.  Our crew always seems to find plenty of healthy options to satisfy our hunger.  The loss of a star for this location is for tepid soup and the lack of a tidy dining room. We had a hard time finding a clean table for late lunch."}
{"text":"Panera is my \"go to\" place when I want quick and healthy meal:) it is a \"sit down\" type of restaurant, but meals are prepared in minutes. Very busy during lunch, it offers rapid ordering via smart phone app or their website so you can do it ahead and just pick up your order from a shelf without going to their counter"}
{"text":"Dirty place, bathroom was horribly dirty. Ordered soup and sandwich which took longer than expected... That was fine but when it arrived, the spoon that came on the plate was obviously not washed since the previous customer used it. Was sticky and covered in old food. The health unit should likely shut this place down."}
{"text":"Along with Subway, this is a fast food place that doesn't go out of its way to make you obese. Which is basically the only reason I come here. I've gone to many Panera Breads before - hell, I have a rewards card when I patronized another of their establishments elsewhere - but this one isn't quite as up to snuff as the others. I invariably get a half bowl of tomato soup with a baguette, and a half bowl of Cobb salad with avocado. As others have noted, I've gotten dirty silverware, and their portion of salad is never as much as I'm used to. Finally, the place looks just slightly less clean and well-maintained when compared other Panera Breads that I've been to. I don't really know why that is."}
{"text":"Worst Panera Bread ever been to. Usually don't write bad reviews but since I've been to many other fantastic ones i know what to expect and I was extremely disappointed at this location, with staff and food. The only pleasant thing was the cashier. They were out of the Peach & Blueberry smoothie (only smoothie offering Almond Milk) and they were out. I proceeded to ask what's in the Superfruit smoothie and she was like \"uhhhhhhhh.....\" are you kidding me? I said just give me Greek yogurt. They didn't even offer to refund the difference to me or give me something for the hassle. So they basically stole from me as well and took the surplus money I paid. Management needs to get in here and get inventory and staff corrected. What a joke."}
{"text":"Again I will post one more critique of Panera in Oakmont I hope either someone in management will pay attention,care enough and address ALL the negative posts. I ordered soup the other day and it q a. Luke warm so I addressed this with the girl at the register and ask for the soup to be reheated she told me there the microwave and for me to reheat it myself, now that's not a big deal but that is also not good customer service and when I asked her to reheat it she said no that's not her job and told me to take the soup to another employee instead of doing it her self. This is just another example of the rudeness ,lack of customer skills and total lack of training or a laziness on her part and to make matters worse the soup was VERY watered down. I TOTALLY DISLIKE THIS PANERA AND AM.SURE THIS WAS MY LAST STOP THERE. Hey Sam Covelli read the messages all pertaining to the poor service  and at the very least address the situation and at the very best train osome of the people working there and fire some as well,you odloowould be doing both the corporate a good deed as well as sevall of them for gthe customers  before you  loose most of them."}
{"text":"I come here a lot.
I work nearby, so it's super convenient. 
They have installed kiosks to take your order since the name change from paradise to Panera, which makes the process a lot more seamless and easy. 

I am super traditional when it comes to Caesar salads and I typically just get a plain caesar, but I will say I love their chicken! The broccoli cheddar soup is amazing. I love the passion fruit tea. Ugh. I could ramble on.

Actually. The cherry pastry gets its own spotlight. I'll take one of these every single day of my life until I find myself in a sugar coma."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place after wanting to from their ads. I got a salad to go, the Green Goddess Cobb which is probably not exactly diet fare but hey...sometimes ya gotta live a little. 

I'm a salad junkie - I love a good salad and make them frequently for myself so sometimes, I like someone else to do the work and I was not disappointed. It was delicious!! Unlike most take out salads, it was NOT made up of soggy, wilted iceberg lettuce with a couple of tomato wedges thrown in. The ingredients were fresh and plentiful and the dressing was yummy. It was more than satisfying and filling. 

I only wish we had one of these near me because I would definitely be going there probably more often than I should."}
{"text":"They recently remodeled and it is very nice. They have very convenient Kiosk and everybody there was very nice. The food was very good and it came fairly fast. I have only been to Panera 2-3 times but this one was very nice. A lot of seating and everything from booths, tables, and Pub style seating. They have a drive thru which I had never seen for a Panera. I will definitely go back and would recommend to my friends I had the New England chowder and a Steak sandwich. Went very well together but was not over whelming."}
{"text":"Prices are usual for Panera Bread. A little premium on in exchange for the great food and atmosphere. Chill music, free WiFi (had problems with this for my laptop), and in a great & convenient location.

Hours are 6:30-10pm From Sunday-Thursday."}
{"text":"This location is the absolute worst. I gave 2 stars simply because the food is consistent. That's the good. The bad is a lengthy list. Rapid pick up is never ready at the quoted time. Employees lack a sense of urgency - it's like they know this location sucks and they accept it. I've had more orders prepared wrong than right (croutons in my soup when I requested they be omitted because I'm gluten-sensitive, no chicken in my salad, entire items missing from to-go orders, I won't bore you with any more examples). Once I was promised they would make note of a salad credit because I called to tell them they messed up my to-go salad and when I tried to redeem the credit a week later I was told the manager must have forgotten to write it down so they couldn't honor it. Nice. 

After today's rapid pick up order experience, I've had enough. I actually asked if I could bag my own order because I'd been there twice as long as I was quoted and it has sat on the counter for 5 minutes. I can't keep spending $10 on a meal that consistently frustrates me. Bye Panera."}
{"text":"sunday breakfast here is really nice. a couple times a month we get up early, sit on their lovely patio and enjoy a lazy breakfast. this location has plenty of tables and chairs outside that are comfy and sturdy. he always enjoys the waffle, which is always served with lots of fresh strawberries that i pilfer. i like the eggs, toast, fruit and bacon (bacon is redistributed to his plate). the bread they use for toast is always awesome ... they call it leven bread, but i think it tastes like sourdough. the fruit portion is a bit small and full of melon, but enjoyable and fresh. portions are neither too big nor too small. staffers are helpful and friendly. all around a really good, consistent breakfast spot."}
{"text":"The food is great, as all Panara breads are. However, the staff is awful. I ordered food Togo that was paid for and never received. I called when I got home to tell them the mistake and that I wanted a refund and they didn't offer anything except to drive back and get it. They were so rude and didn't care about their mistake. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I go to the location on Fort Apache all the time so I was happy when I found out there was one closer to me.  I read all the reviews and was hoping that since they've been open for a bit now that they've improved.  Sadly no.  When I opened my order at work I had to pick out half of the greens from my salad because they were wilted.  I decided to risk with the rest of the salad and I haven't had any bad effects yet as I'm still eating it. I'll update if annum bad happens.

I added a star because of the convenient drive through otherwise I'd give 2."}
{"text":"We have stopped at this location a few times lately while my house gets remodeled and I can't cook at home right now. The food is very good, I have to admit, BUT it is extremely overpriced. Charging over $9 for a simple turkey sandwich seems outrageous to me. We paid over $22 for 2 cups of soup, one full and 1/2 sandwich and 1 drink.
No way! Not happening again."}
{"text":"I like the food at Panera. This location is fairly nice but parking can get crowded during high-demand times. The bagels are about the best in the city in my opinion. The staff is constantly changing so your service will vary depending on who is working. One thing I wish they would improve is their toaster. If you want a toasted bagel ask them to run it through the machine twice. It's a chain and very reliable. Sometimes I wish they'd change the menu more often but overall it's a good place."}
{"text":"Very disappointed as I went in to get food the other night. Paid for a full Mac & cheese, and upon returning home realized it was only a half. also ordered their chicken southwest salad & there were NO tortilla strips, which frankly is the only reason I drove out to Paradise. Tried searching the Internet for a customer service line & it is not in service. Totally unprofessional if you ask me. They charge way too much for the rip offs they incur on their customers. You have lost the business of my friends, family, & myself."}
{"text":"Ordered the bacon turkey bravo panini (the tomato basil bread is amazing!!!) the mac & cheese is always great. I love the fact that they deliver."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars. Better service and food quality here than other Panera locations. Occasionally I will receive a salad with a couple of wilted leaves, but for the most part the food here has been pretty consistently fresh. 

There are a number of electronic kiosks by the entrance to streamline the ordering process. Grab a buzzer and your food will be delivered to your table when it's ready. Dine in service is usually quite fast, less than 10 min, and very friendly. 

As other reviews mentioned this used to be a Paradise Bakery, which IMO was preferable for the wider variety of their menu and free cookie with each meal - both of those are lost with Panera. 

Prices are a little steep - expect to pay around $15 for a half salad, half sandwich, and drink. 

Most of the menu items are decent. A little generic, nothing spectacular, but it gets the job done when I'm craving a light, simple meal and am too lazy to make my own sandwich. The one exception are the bear claws, can't get enough of those!

Of note, the rapid pickup online ordering option usually takes longer than the promised 5 min. Give it closer to 10-15 min. 

TL;DR
- Food 3.5/5
- Service 4/5
- Price 3/5
- Good place for a quick bite and light, healthy meal"}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru and everything was fast and efficient. I just can't believe how expensive they are and the little food you get. I can't believe it costed me about 20 dollars for a half a sandwich and a drink. Definitely not coming here again for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I frequent panera bread quit often, mainly on my lunch breaks.. My son also loves the mac & cheese. They have a lot of variety, and the food is always fresh and good. The staff is also very friendly and helpful. I went there yesterday and there was a problem with the ice maker on the soda machine. They gave  me ice and I got a soda from the machine. The soda was flat, so I tried another one. That was also flat. I spoke with a person who appeared to be a manager. She explained the sodas were a little flat because the machine was not cold but after being ice it would be ok. I explained to her that that was not the case. I at least would of expected a refund or offered another beverage. Since I paid for a flat soda that I did not drink."}
{"text":"My soup arrived lukewarm and salad arrived hot- lettuce leaves wilting and all. Somethings up with their temp control. I don't like to get up and ask for my food to be served at correct temperature. Plus receipt says you get a treat for trouble of reporting any issues. Good luck being offered that."}
{"text":"The food is decent but their prices are ridiculous. If you want to pay $10 for some soup and a drink, go ahead. I got a plate of pasta and a small salad. Cost me $15. Bro, if I'm paying $15 for a meal, I'm going to a real sit down restaurant and getting service with it."}
{"text":"I like this place.  They have a great selection of healthyish foods for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Their selection includes pastries, sandwiches, soups, salads, wraps and beverages like coffees and teas.  The staff was all very friendly.  I ordered a chicken soup and salad combo and when the server found me he told me he thought my soup might have gotten cold, so he brought me a new one.  I thought that was very kind.   It's a large cafe with comfy sofas and chairs to lounge in.  They also have internet access if you want to bring you laptop in.  It's bright, clean and airy.  The bread is yummy."}
{"text":"I love this place! Good, clean, quick, and consistent. I love a grilled cheese with tomato soup and they have the best! Just right not too much."}
{"text":"Not a fan. The food is ok, but a little too expensive. The biggest problem that I have is that all of the booths are always taken up by fake business people that do not have an office to conduct business in, so they spend all day here. We are here at lunch on a weekday, and every booth is taken up by people with laptops and iPads, but no food in sight. If you want people to come and spend money, allow them to actually sit down to eat."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Panera Bread because i can get a quick meal on the go. However i was disappointed in this particular location. To start there was no one in the food prep location. I thought maybe they were all at a staff meeting as they all came out from the very back at one time to start making food. I was the first one in line to order my food out of about 10 people and the last one to get served. That was only after I asked them to please make my food for me. I thought maybe they had ran out of the soup I ordered however when I asked the gentleman he simply picked up a ladle and scooped it into a bowl and handed it to me.  Great food, terrible service. Next time I am in the area I will yelp for a different Panera bread."}
{"text":"Just picked up a Modern Caprese sandwich which looked like a $2 sandwich at best, not $10 - filled with arugula and balsamic.  Fresh Mozerella was barely visible and had one piece of tomato confit per half. Comparing to the picture on their online menu, it looked like a terrible knock-off prepared by a 5-year old."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food was very good an the service was great an fast. Love the pastries too. Would have lunch with my mom a lot at the one in Ca. Will def be back."}
{"text":"8:30am Sunday, no body was there to take my order because they were hanging out in the kitchen. Final made my order. All coffee was brewed 1.5 hrs ago and cold. Asked if I can get fresh brewed, I was not the only one who came to say the coffee is cold. took over 10mins while my sandwich was getting cold. The casher was so arrogant, never said sorry, only \"your welcome\" when I said thanks. Ruined my morning. So annoying. So overpriced. Why did I come here again? Ugh. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite while on the road.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  It was hot out and the a.c. was kicking and if felt great with a lite dinner."}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this place off my food bucket list for quite some time now.  My mom had let me taste her broccoli and cheese soup from takeout that she brought over a few weeks ago and ever since I've been dying to check this place out.  There menu is pretty easy to read and they are pretty generous with there portions.  If you're looking for a nutritious and healthy hearty meal, you've found the right place.

You order your food, find a table, then they come serve you within 5-10 minutes.  Not dining service, but fast delivery of food.  Place was somewhat messy, but food was very good.  I can see how some reviewers believe Panera Bread is univiting, but don't let looks fool you.  The broccoli and cheese I ordered in a bread bowl and it seriously is something I could have everyday for lunch.  Will definitely come back to check out more items."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch. I had the salad with fuji apples & chicken. The salad was good, but I couldn't get past the fact that the apples were dried apple slices. Why can't Panera serve fresh apple slices? It's not like apples are impossible to come by or ridiculously expensive in February."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Panera. It's my go to place to grab a bite. However this particular location hasn't impressed me. I keep giving it a chance but the past three times I've gone an ingredient has been missing in my Fuji Apple chicken salad. First it was the cheese, second time the nuts, and the third time the actual chicken! I always ask for the missing ingredient and receive it, but it's been disappointing to not receive the complete meal."}
{"text":"You pick 2 is the way to go. Good service, even when it is busy they are very attentive & friendly. Good place for a quick lunch. Love their chicken noodle soup."}
{"text":"Yummy!! Love this place from the soups to the sandwiches. Love the fact the everything is fresh and the chicken is free range. They have so many selection on both salads and sandwiches. The bread selection is awesome! My favorite is the Cobb salad. Love that they give you the option of bread, apples, or chips. Service was quick and staff is polite. It is a little higher than any other place with the same type of food but its because its fresh and great quality. If you want to something fresh and healthy this is an excellent choice!"}
{"text":"Went to this Panera location on a Sunday morning around 8am.  Was looking to purchase 6 plain bagels. However, they only had 1 available. Asked the employee when the new ones would be ready and was told that they were not making any more for the day. How is that even possible to be out of product so early and no plans to make more?  SORRY PANERA. Went to Brueggers Bagels and got everything I needed. Plus the bagels tasted much better than yours. Lost a customer."}
{"text":"Have been to a panera breads and they are pretty much the same. Love the the menu. They have great sandwiches, soups, salads, yummy breads, and cookies, muffins and basically just good baked s***! Love their breakfast sandwiches and the amazing selection of breads they have to choose from. Definitely a healthier version of a normal sandwich place or other places like it. This location  has an outside area to eat which is nice. I would say they need to be a little cleaner at this place."}
{"text":"Last visit to Panera.  Portions are way down, and Prices are way up.  For a few dollars more you can eat a nice place.  They even have the balls to solicit tips for there staff at the register.  Fck this place."}
{"text":"If you want a quick meal that's much healthier than the fast food restaurants in the area, Panera's the way to go.  Delicious paninis and great soups (even greater in a bread bowl) for super cheap.  And free wi-fi.  Thank you for opening a Panera in my area.  Wow, that rhymed."}
{"text":"Management is amazing. Everytime I walk in they always great me. When I am eating they come up to me and ask me if I need anything and ask how is the food. A very positive up beat environment. I eat a lot of dinners there."}
{"text":"I took a long time to express my dissatisfaction. I've been a.fan of Paradise Bakery and knowing Panera was same family and being around the corner I've given the several chances..

A) always running out of items
B) drive thru is horrible.. they always mess up my orders.. ALWAYS
c) 4 different occasions we have found hair in the food and twice inside their cookies  (gross)..

Very bad service....  way too bad because have been a loyal client for years to their PB stores"}
{"text":"I've been at least 6 times in past 2 weeks. Drive through wait is extremely long. Food is always prepared differently (one day the flat bread is good the next day it's not) it's never consistent. I understand they're new but it's not a good way to start the business. I usually love this place but the more I go to this one the less I like it. They need to step it up, before they have one less costumer."}
{"text":"Oh I love Panera Bread! I'm having the Strawberry Chicken Salad!  Yum and the chicken dumpling soup! Their desserts are yummy and BIG! The prices are resonable and the portions big"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place only has 3 stars. I came by here to study for an exam and I literally stayed ALL DAY. I love the set up of this Panera - and having lived in St. Louis (where Panera originates - St. Louis Bread Co for life!!), I have to say I really love this location!

The waiters are nice, the ambiance is nice, the fountain outside is BEAUTIFUL! The food is reliable as always - 0 complaints! 

After spending an entire Thursday at Panera, I found the busiest times to order were 11:30AM-1PM. The kiosks are super efficient during these times! I'll definitely be back here to study."}
{"text":"I like most Panera locations I have been to, and this one is a delight. The food is great, but most importantly the employees and service are far better than most places in Vegas off the Strip. It is easy to go to fast(ish) food places and find sad, apathetic service. Thank you to this location for having people who care and seem happy to be at work. Clean, nice, efficient with crowds or without."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice and the only consistent thing is rude staff who apparently are not trained in customer service skills. The potato soup was *ok*."}
{"text":"Bring Paradise back! 

Stopped in here today for lunch. Ordered a salad. Had no idea where to wait. She register girl just said \"have a seat, and we'll call your name\". So I sat and waited in the dining area for about 10 minutes.My name was never called. Then I went over to the area where it seemed that people were retrieving their orders. I looked on the counter and there stood my bag. 

I finally left and am (attempting) to eat the salad now. They give you two cups of dressing which is nice, but doesn't help that the chicken is undercooked and chewy, and that they severely skimp on the corn, black beans and tortilla strips. This salad was nearly $9. Not worth even $5.

I really wish Panera never bought out Paradise Bakery. I won't return here."}
{"text":"I would give this place one more star if they didn't discontinue the IC Spice drinks. Grr. They were good.

This is a good place to get a cup of soup or a sandwich. Nothing fancy, but tasty none the less. I like being able to do a combo with basically whatever. It's nice to have options! Decent bagels, although it's best to go early in the morning to snatch those up. Good spreads to take along, too."}
{"text":"This is a very nice panera bread. There is lots of room for sitting and chatting with friends. My friends and I go there regularly for coffee."}
{"text":"The food is always good. The bread is so soft on the Roasted Turkey Alvacado BLT and the Lemon Chicken Or so is so delish. Great flavor. I also like the way the employees are so helpful. I was here having lunch with my son and noticed a few things that surprised me in a good way. A guy walked in whom was probably homeless and all he wanted was some water. They showed him where the cups were and let him get the water he needed. Then not 2 mins later I see a blind couple come in and they helped them to get their drinks and to a table. I think that is great that the employees here are so caring to help these people out."}
{"text":"I order rapid pick up food was ready on time!
Panera is great overall every where I go is pretty nice the employees are always energetic and friendly"}
{"text":"First time coming here for Breakfast and it was amazing and the atmosphere is cool and they have the best service and the food us unbelievable amazing like the steak panini and Chicken Cobb and Avocado salad and great prices and deals and get a my panera members card so you you get rewards and it's great for gathering and hang out . High recommend!"}
{"text":"It good place to eat.I had almost ever sandwich there
And every soup almost.The food was good and health.
You get pick soul or sandwich or sandwich or salad.You get half sanf soup and you don't all day anymore. The desert s are amazing to.
The employee s are so nice and caring and helpful.
You should get panera rewards card it help.

It one best places every been.Great atmosphere there."}
{"text":"This used to be Paradise Bakery... until you guys bought them out and made the food horrible....  you know why you get 1 Star, you know why! Also bad customer service."}
{"text":"It's not paradise bakery... never will be .. so upset like the change the sign you're now Panera ... the salads aren't the same... thankfully the cookies still taste good! The customer service is pretty dope too. Just wish it was paradise bakery.... sigh"}
{"text":"Nicer newer panera.  The inside is modern with nice looking hanging lights and a fireplace.  A very nice feel, just like your living room.  The workers are very helpful and pleasant.  

My main gripe about this location is the poorly designed drive through.  Do not try to come here during lunch as the drive through line clogs the entire parking (good luck getting out of your parking spot) and the wait for the drive through is blevwn worse, 15 minutes on average.  What is worse is that the drive through is so narrow that you would have to be an expert driver to not run over this curb exiting the drive through!

Gripes aside the food is very good made from high quality ingredients.  The price is a little on the high side but that is panera, expect to pay at least $10 for lunch.  I've been here several times and on my latest trip I enjoyed a strawberry poppyseed salad.  Very refreshing on a summers day."}
{"text":"probably one of the worst sandwiches i ever ate....you know why they are panera bread?because that's all it was...bread, you couldn't taste the two peices of meat and one slice of cheese on the sandwich...know when you order any of the steak sandwiches...it's roast beef."}
{"text":"This place has serious problems with management.  I went to order a simple caesar salad today...and never received it.  Total disorganization is the only way I can describe the experience today.  Ended with a refund.  

I ordered $100 worth of food from the Mccandless location this a.m. Completely different discussion. I was in and out of the store within 3 mins.  Great management.

Won't go back to the Oakland location in Pittsburgh for a long time."}
{"text":"Great little location. Very close to everything. Very clean...staff very diligently cleaning and picking up all the time I was there. 
Seems to be a great meeting place. Friend I was meeting there, said a lot of tutors meet their clients there. I witnessed a professor that met with MANY of his students here.
Love this location as it's building and thriving. They seem to be doing a great job. 
I'd definitely go back to this location for a meeting. 
Doesn't hurt that their salads and teas are great!"}
{"text":"I went here to enjoy a day out while still sticking to my 'diet'. My boyfriend and I both chose the (full) Greek Salad w/ Chicken.  We had the choice of a side: hunk of baguette, apple, or kettle cooked potato chips.  Not the best sides for one on a low carb diet so we left the chips for the next customer.

The salads were fresh and delicious, with a nice amount of dressing, not too much or too little.  I did notice that they either got rid of the pickled onions or didn't have any this day, because I got normal sliced red onion.  Also, a couple pieces of our chicken were actually frozen in the middle (they were fully cooked and everything, just literally frozen) which was off-putting but we just ate around them until they thawed out a little bit lol! Although clearly fully cooked and frozen from a bag, their chicken is always delicious and seasoned nicely. 

My boyfriend tested out most of the teas- he really liked the green tea w/ mango and stuck with that one for his meal. 

I think $8 for a salad is a bit high for fast-casual but in my opinion, it has a restaurant quality and portion size to it and also it comes with your choice of a side, so I am just fine paying that amount to be able to treat myself to a nice fresh healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Panera...with a DRIVE THROUGH!!  Love it, I have always been a fan of Panera, but now that we have one right down Providence from my house with a drive through, Well, wonders never cease. How nice to be able to get hot soup or a Panini or even a Green Tea in your car. I was there last night for a Meeting which I hosted. Internally it is a small restaurant compared to some of the other ones locally. But the flavor and friendly employees are all still there. Outstanding customer service at the counter - they bring you your food at this establishment. The only thing that I disagreed with is that it closes at 9:00PM and I went to the counter at 8:45 and they had already packed up in huge plastic bags almost every loaf of their bread, now the great thing is they give it to the local homeless shelters but I did want to purchase some myself and I think if they just could have left a few loaves on the shelf! So it is a great addition to the Arbo, Try it..swing by and use the Drive-thru !!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the cafe on w lake mead and they're fabulous with everything. Something changed my mind this time. I went to the one on rampart and I did a to go order over the phone. The customer service was out of this world! I was pretty upset due to the fact that they were out of a lot of things that I had ordered. The assistant manager and one of the associate trainers were so kind and payed for my meal!! They greeted me with smiles and were so happy to help me! I'll be visiting this one more often!"}
{"text":"All time favorite lunch spot!  Best cookies you'll find anywhere!  Also fantastic lunches, such as Chicken Walnut and Turkey Cranberry sandwiches.  The salads are excellent too.  I usually create my own, but all of their Signature Salads are delicious. Go here for lunch if you haven't yet, I am sure you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"Having worked for Panera bread for 4 1/2 years, I hold it to a fairly high standard. I hate to say it, but my most recent trip left little to be desired. The staff was not very friendly and we were not greeted when we got to the register. The girl taking our order was wearing gloves when she took my money, and I'm really hoping she changed them before handling food. 

The restaurant itself has a lot of tables for two but not many tables for a larger group of people. We chose a table/booth combination and unfortunately the table top was dirty. I asked the employee if she could wipe down the table or provide me with a rag to wipe it down myself. The carpet was dirty and the service was very slow considering there were not many people in the restaurant. 

Overall, the food was good. I had just a cup of broccoli and cheddar soup, the little one had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with yogurt and apple juice, and Adam had you pick two with a chipotle chicken sandwich and broccoli cheddar soup.

It's a good option for a fast dinner without the fast food vibe, but I'm hoping the service and cleanliness improves by my next visit."}
{"text":"Super slow service.  Waited no joke 20 minutes for my food.  I have 30 min to take for lunch.  Speed up or get more staff to help.  I am actually typing this while I wait so wait time was at least 23 minutes ."}
{"text":"Not a bad thing on the menu in my opinion.  The selection also has many healthy alternatives which is important to me.  This particular location I have dined at a few times now and the service is always good and they do an exceptional job of getting people in and out while maintaining a clean dining area.  

The patio area at this particular location isn't that impressive due to the fact, the only real view is Independence Blvd. so keep that in mind.  

And of course with all Panera Bread locations there's always the free wireless and in this day and age if a place doesn't have wireless connectivity that is a serious bummer for me."}
{"text":"My wife disliked this Panara. The staff was very rude and nasty. Her orders were all wrong, when she got back from Panara,"}
{"text":"I remember this place used to be friendly, but now the quality of the restaurant has since gone down hill.

Food wise, the pastries aren't the freshest, nor is their coffee. The latest brew of coffee was 2:45pm and we visited at 5:00pm - naturally the coffee was lukewarm. The place is obviously understaffed and not upkept well at all - mess everywhere, coffee spills on the coffee refill counter and unfilled milk/cream jugs. A mug provided even still had lipstick stains on it.

The only saving grace is the atmosphere  - quiet, quaint, apt for a sip of coffee and scroll through your phone and or working quietly. But that being said we won't be revisiting anytime soon."}
{"text":"Really, not too bad!   I get they're trying to set themselves up as a millennial kinda restaurant with  a cause kinda thing, but I just came here because I wanted to try something different.   I got the steak and white cheddar panini with some cheddar broccoli soup and it was delicious.   Its cafeteria style kinda place and they do it nicely.    

I'll be back."}
{"text":"What caught my attention to this place was the Health food aspect. So I bit.
The theme is like Starbucks if they only served food. Also There was deal for 7.99 to get half of the signature items. I thought i was ordering that but instead got the full which was good I got the chipotle chicken sandwich with an apple. The bread bowls are huge.

The lady behind the counter was rude, but the service beyond her was great and a little spot to relaz and eat good food. I love it."}
{"text":"A great hang over cure..

I love this place, and walking in is so inviting. So I love the chipotle chicken sandwich. And it fills you up quick. That and a bottle of Jones soda pop makes it complete. Screw normal fastfood, this place is awesome."}
{"text":"Half steak white cheese panini for $8+tax and the portion is SO SMALL! laughed when the food came out. The taste is just average. I think is too over priced for this tiny small piece of panini. If you want decent cheap and good panini, just go to Tim Horton. Panera is going downhill. This is just unacceptable. Will not recommend anyone to come here unless you got too much money."}
{"text":"I love Panera I really do but this mall location has me so lost
I don't get it. We came today for lunch my hubby got the pick 2. Mac and cheese and a steak and cheddar sandwich I got just the squash soup.. 
it all goes down hill from here my hubby his sandwich wish tasted like sour milk omg the smell coming off it was so nasty!!!!!! So I was back and tell them ask them for a different sandwich bc that was just god awful so I pick this chicken one and said please no onion or tomatoes guess what was on the freaking sandwich.. yup onions and tomatoes!!!! Why is it so hard to listen to something so dang simple?????????? Put ur little listening ears on and do your job.
But my soup was amazing minus the bread that comes with it meh it was frozen cold in the center . Kinda bummed me out .
Anyway we will still go to Panera but the one across the street not in the mall.."}
{"text":"$7.49 for a 1/2 sandwich with a 1oz bag of chips? It was far from memorable. To each his own I guess.."}
{"text":"I love Panera.  As far as a chain goes, they are fairly consistent, you know what they are going to have and it is going to taste good.  Found this fairly new Panera as we were traveling the back roads of PA and both of us were famished.  As Sophie was still small, I was able to smuggle her in.  I ordered our normal items while adding the Macaroni and Cheese:

Chipotle Chicken sandwich with potato soup
Roast beef sandwich with chicken noodle

The Chipotle Chicken sandwich is one of the FEW sandwiches I will order and NOT add or remove items.  It is good the way it is: chicken, tomato, chipotle mayo, thin onions, ciabatta bread.  Be wary of the potato soup, though, since some of the Paneras mix it up with the clam chowder.  The potato soup is good, the clam chowder not so much.  Ask for a sample, if you see any red then skip it.  Today, it was the true potato soup and it was good.

While the Mac n' Cheese was okay, it was nothing special.  I don't know that I would ever crave it."}
{"text":"Wow. My soul hurts. I miss the Paradise. 

From the half-hearted attempt at beautifying prepackaged food to the complete abandonment of functionality, this place is a step below the corner QuikTrip. No ice. No clean tables. No available highchairs. Table service from a Walker straight out of your favorite post-apocalyptic cable drama.

The macaroni is made-to-order out of an envelope. The salad materials look like they were prepared by a tool from the 'As Seen On TV' store. The chicken, when it was fresh, was part of a juggling act, it seems. And all of this is served at your table by a girl who can only be described as walking through life as though she were in locked-in syndrome, mobile but trapped in her own living hell.

What about the layout, you ask? Well, I'll tell you. If you want to walk in the most logical door, you end up sidestepping around people's table in the tiny dining room. Then you arrive at the counter, where queuing theory is more like chaos theory. Once you place your order, you go sit down. Then you get back up and push your way into a little corner right next to where the food is served. Maybe you get to the fountains, maybe not. Then you push your way back out of the throng and shuffle around more cramped tables until you sit at one of the 2 clean tables and crunch white salad, tasteless cold cuts and bland bread.

Did you ever make it out to Paradise? Over by Grimaldi's and the excellent greek place, Cyprus Grill? Yeah, well that was pretty good food, and a nice, relaxed and comfortable atmosphere. This place, however, makes me want to spit bile. It would taste better than what they are serving."}
{"text":"Paradise is great. My go-to meal is the southwest Caesar salad (an item Panera Bread doesn't have). This location is rumored to transition into a Panera which makes me sad. The loss of star is because this place sometimes seems a bit mismanaged. The employees often look lost, and as an orderer you have to keep an eye to make sure they are getting your order right. Great food though."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed with this Location!

I have been here more than 5 times now,and each and every time the cookies have not been properly baked!

Underdone and or old! I can tell just by looking at them,I don't know why I continue to waste my money here.

I gave them a chance being that they were new, but their cooks really need to get a clue, none of the other locations I have been to have a problem with their cookies only this one!

I will not go back here for cookies or anything else!"}
{"text":"I placed a very small catering order online.  Unfortunately something came up and I had to cancel the order.  Their web site indicates the order can be cancelled up to one hour before the scheduled pick up time.  I cancelled the order at least 4 hours prior to pickup.  I was surprised when the charge still showed up on my credit card.  I called the number on the web site and after spending over 1/2 hour on the phone, they said there must have been a \"hiccup\" in the system, but I would have to contact the manager of the pick up location to try to resolve the issue.  I cannot spend another hour on the phone, I disputed the charge through the credit card.  Regardless of the outcome, I will not order from Panera again, the food is good, but the aggravation of this is just not worth it."}
{"text":"Boy who served me my food, name Alex or Andy, was very courteous and was very nice to my kids"}
{"text":"Just ordered a Fuji apple chicken salad only to find out once I got home they forgot the chicken...annoying"}
{"text":"From San Diego, I visit Panera bread all the time.  This is my first time to Las Vegas in 14 years, and thought I'd check out this Panera.  It's an extremely busy day, with hundreds of soccer families storming the restaurants, including this one.  Although it is extremely busy, the food was served quickly, and very good, and the wait staff is especially on top of things.

Amy was quick to clean off the table for me and my family, and when she realized I needed a couple more chairs, she helped me locate vacant ones around the restaurant.  You could tell that she really cares about doing a good job. Very attentive, with a nice smile, and a calm demeanor, especially considering how chaotic and busy it was.

This Panera bread is really on top of things, with people like her serving patrons."}
{"text":"I love Panera, and the food and folks at this location are fine, but the internet here is the worst, completely unusable!"}
{"text":"Great except for knowing this was heated up in the big soup tub & not fresh from the pot. The bread was okay too."}
{"text":"Do not go too this location without checking your bag first. I paid for a tub of cream cheese and was given a small. Not enough for 2 bagels. Please please please check your bags!!!"}
{"text":"Very good and fast! Dined in and was very happy with my order. While I was eating I did a rapid order and it was waiting when I was finished eating. A+"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the fact that my sandwich, steak and arugula, bread was soaked on the bottom. The sandwich was sitting on the napkin, not sure if the arugula was washed and soaking wet, or if it was the tomato, but how would it get that soaked when it was just made? Turkey chili was good, the part of the sandwich I did eat had a great taste. My daughters food was good. I go to Panera's all the time cause I love the food, usually! 
You can see in the pic how wet the napkin was"}
{"text":"Food was fresh as usual, turkey bacon bravo sandwich was good. French onion soup was on point. Always fast always good!"}
{"text":"I'm from New York, so there are a lot of things down here in North Carolina that I'm not familiar with or that they don't have, like Tim Hortons :( But Panera is something we have up in NY and a place I'm quite fond of. It was great to have a little piece of home while I'm here. Nothing but good things to say about this place."}
{"text":"For a long time, Paradise Bakery was the go-to bread company of this nature in the Phoenix Valley.  I hope that is changing, because I think Panera is better on their bakery items.  Maybe it is exactly the same?  I don't know but I like Panera better for whatever reason.  LOL

I am in Panera this month as part of their launch of several new changes, most notably I understand the local joints just launched the \"order-by-app\" feature and high-tech in-store kiosks.  They have lured me in now three days in a row with their free daily coffee for a month.  DID I HEAR THAT RIGHT!? FREE DRINKS FOR A MONTH!  BAM.

Yep.  It is pretty dang smart too.  I've now spent upwards of $40 on lunches to get the free drink.  And I am reminded of why I love the brand again!  This place is top notch.  The people are friendly as all hell too, and I am re-addicted to the macaroni and cheese!  OMG SO GOOD!  The paninis are great too ... and the sugar cookie ... oh lord.  It will marry your palate in heaven. You'll buy another ... I just know."}
{"text":"What do I love about Panera? The food is prepared fresh, they use whole foods, and their chicken is raised without antibiotics. That's awesome! I can't wait until more restaurants start following suit. 

What do I really, really, not love? The prices and lately, the portions. Prices are going up while sizes, particularly of their salads, are decreasing-and that's the chain, not just this location.

Today I got a cup of soup and a full size greens salad. I didn't go for the pick 2 because I never feel full after going the soup and salad route there. I thought if I got a full salad instead, that would fix this issue, right? 

No.

My salad didn't come close to filling the bowl. I paid $12+ for my meal, no drink, nothing but the soup and salad. So the tiny greens salad-which is the cheapest one on the menu and the most plain, without any meat or ANYTHING but greens, a couple slices of red onions, and dressing-cost nearly $7.00. That's crazy. All they have to do to improve the salads is just add more lettuce/greens. Even when I'm ordering a specialty salad, I don't want or expect more chicken/nuts/etc. Just please. Please help the salad to not look completely pathetic. 

I like Panera, I'll keep going for the food, but I'm staying away from their salads for good. My wallet hurts looking at what cost $7.00 when it would be less than $1.00 for me to throw together at home...any maybe then I'd actually be full after."}
{"text":"Regardless of the other reviews ,this is our local Panera..always friendly and clean  and we will come here often . Breakfast lunch or Dinner they hit the marks .  Thanks Panera."}
{"text":"Always fresh and ready for the pastries and bagels. The staff is very helpful and polite ."}
{"text":"The only time I eat here is when it's someone else's idea. Not that the food isn't great, but the crowd is annoying. The place is always slammed. I guess that's a good thing. Means the food is pretty darn good. And you know what? It is pretty darn good. I'd recommend it to anyone.

I hate to say this, but since the arrival of Cafe Zupas, I always refer them over Panera Bread when a friend suggests we eat here. The sandwiches, soups and salads are just better. But, they suffer the same thing this place does. Very crowded. This place isn't as congested as Zupas, so I would come here more often if I didn't want an issue with finding a place to sit and being able to hear the person sitting across from me. 

Great food here. Great food. I recommend. Just be ready for the packed house if coming for lunch."}
{"text":"Food is excellent and I like ordering and paying before eating; saves time. BBQ chicken flatbread was great. French onion soup was a bit disappointing due to few croutons instead of bread slice, hardly any cheese and not in a crockpot as is normally the case elsewhere. The free side of kettle chips is a nice side."}
{"text":"No matter how many times I go, I'll never get used to the ordering system. But the food is delicious (expensive, but it's one of the few places near me with healthy options). I love their Broccoli Cheese soup and the Greek Salad. Plus it's nice to take some time to sit down with a good book or NDS game and relax on my lunch break."}
{"text":"I had the salad they are featuring, turkey with cherries, feta, pears and pecans. It was good and fresh but a bit spendy for 8.00 or so alone. i got a drink and a cookie add on and it was almost 13.00 which is kind of a lot since I still felt hungry after.

The food was fresh and the place was pretty tidy, ok, but not somewhere I go out of my way to get to."}
{"text":"i love the food honestly i do, and i ordered three times a week roughly. but id say they get my order wrong 50% of the time so that's a bit of a hassle"}
{"text":"I have to say, that I haven't had anything bad off the menu from Panera Bread, but this particular location ALWAYS lacks in the seating area. The service is always great, the manager is always back there with the crew working right beside them, the food has always been great.  The seating sucks, though, and sometimes I'd like to eat there instead of getting everything to go or have to eat outside when it's too hot or too cold."}
{"text":"I have been a long standing Panera fan and customer. I enjoy their fresh baked sweets and breads. I think for the price you are much better off buying bread from Panera than so called better quality bread in the store...lets face it nothing beats fresh bread! 

This store is a good store and nicely situated in Boca Park. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful however, I have to admit I don't like the counter lay-out (sometimes the staff is around the corner and you have to seek them out), the staff needs a little more training (I bought bread and the clerk didn't know how to bag it) and they need to work a little harder to keep the place clean. 

But overall I enjoy Panera and think the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"We came at 9:50 PM to have dinner as we waited out a layover. When we get to the counter to order the employee did not great us, she just stated we only have vegans and soup. Ok, I was a bit taken back by her lack of customer service etiquette but also astounded that they \"only\" had those two things. 

I order a bread bowl and she says they don't have bread bowls and says I can have bread on the side. At this point I'm starving so I just take it. My gf orders a bagel with cream cheese and the lady at the counter says they have no cream cheese! How do you not have any cream cheese? You specifically specialize in bread and you don't have the necessary ingredients to serve some of your most well known menus items? Ridiculous. 

So we only end up getting a soup and a nasty attitude. Several people were lined up behind us and the lady tells them all that they are closed and turns off the lights! At this time it is 9:53PM and people are clearly upset. 

I cannot believe the service that is provided here. I will be reaching out to corporate because I know this location can care less about what the customer thinks."}
{"text":"I have only made one stop here, and that was to buy some bagels.  I had a sesame bagel this morning and it was OK.  Service was quick and the person who took my order was very pleasant and courteous.

My only complaint about the place is the same for any storefront in this area.  The parking can be a bear."}
{"text":"Had the Apple turkey sandwich and tomato soup. Was very tasty and would get again. Only an average review, as the restaurant was not very busy, but many dirty tables. Also the pricing outside a \"pick 2\" option is very expensive."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. Always puts blame on others instead of fixing the problem. The young Hispanic girl who works the night shift needs an attitude adjustment before she's out of a job. However, Juan (I think that's his name) he's the manager and was really nice !! He helped us and fixed the issue. Even returned our money because of how horrible the service was and how upset we were"}
{"text":"This place can be great or a disaster. I have found that it is impossible to eat here on Sunday's for lunch. I have tried but it took 45 minutes for me to receive a salad. Some times during the week they run out of simple food and that can be disheartening. They do have a great menu and there are many opportunities to customize your meal. I have never had an issue with the taste of the food but the service needs some improvement. It's fast casual and they bring you your food after you order at the front. I like the kiosk options because it lets you explore the menu more. The tables in the cafe are often dirty or sticky. I have never seen it genuinely clean when I enter. The drive through is descent but can sometimes take a while. I prefer now to order on the app on my phone for rapid pick up and then take my food home to eat. Many of my favorites seems to be seasonal. I enjoy the black bean soup and the sesame Asian chicken salad."}
{"text":"Oh Panera Bread. Why are you so good?

Yes, it is a franchised joint. However, they do everything very well. 

Your best bet is to get the combo meal in which you choose 2 items out of a variety of soups, salads and half sandwiches for a little less than 10 bucks. I highly recommend the Napa Almond Chicken Sandwich and French Onion Soup. 

The staff is very friendly at this location but beware! They will always try to persuade you to add a delicious pastry to your meal for 99 cents. The English Toffee Cookie is large and extremely delicious. 

The iced tea here is the best!! Don't forget they have free wi-fi too!"}
{"text":"I'll leave my review at 3 stars for now.  This was my first visit to a Panera Bread to get sandwiches for dinner.  We needed a break from getting subs at different places and I chose to try something new.  This location opened recently.  It makes where I live about halfway between to Panera's but I decided to try this one.

Service was great at the counter, but the wait seemed long for the take out until I realized they had a number of people eating in who had ordered just before I got there.  I brought the sandwiches home and they were very good.  My wife had their Cuban chicken panini and I had the signature Steak and white cheddar.  They were both very good.  My panini had a fair kick from the horseradish spread on the sandwich.  With the sandwiches, I opted for the small bag of chips for each of us.

The order was packaged really nice in two small cardboard boxes.  My only complaint with this is there's really no way to tell which sandwich is which unless you peel back some of the bread to reveal the contents.  Some places put a numbered sticker on their sandwiches to match the items on your receipt.  The boxes at Panera have a place you could write the name.  I sent a suggestion to HQ and the responded that they'd look into it.

I'll return and I think I'll eat in.  The dining room is very nice and there's outdoor seating for when it's cooler."}
{"text":"Love that there's a Panera closer to me, and love that it has a drive-thru!  So convenient, especially when picking up breakfast for the office.  Has all of the typical Panera food, and is the same quality I've had at other Panera's.  Breads are always freshly baked, and never, ever skip getting a chocolate chip cookie with your meal.  They are delicious!  Love the inside, lots of tables and corners for private conversations or some quiet solitude.

This is a new location so I think they are still working on efficiency with the drive-thru.  Sometimes the wait can be a little long, even for simpler orders."}
{"text":"Typical Panera food.  Good sandwiches, soups, salads, and pastries.  My favorite is the basic grilled cheese with the creamy tomato soup or the You Pick Two combo with tuna salad sandwich and one of the soups.  Their chocolate chip cookies are always the perfect amount of gooey, fresh out of the oven flavor.  I can never order a meal without getting a cookie.

Food is very consistent with this location and the service is also pretty friendly and helpful.  Plenty of seating, even during the busy times.  Make sure you sign up for the Panera Rewards card.  It's free and you can get free goodies with it, which is always a plus in my book.  I don't like how the ordering line is situated.  It wraps around this rather large pillar so you are unable to view 95% of the menu until you are the next one to order."}
{"text":"First let's begin by saying the store is located INSIDE the hospital. No where on the website does it state that. If I knew that we would have gone to a more easy to access store. So beware you have to find parking and go inside a hospital. 

Second I placed my order online so it would be ready when we arrived. Well they do this thing where online orders are placed on a shelf inside the cafe. No one watches this shelf. No one makes sure people are taking the correct orders. Someone STOLE my order! I had to wait for them to remake the whole order. What was the whole point of doing the online ordering in the first place???? 

Also my order stated that I DID NOT want my bagel sliced and toasted so that way I could eat it whenever I want too. It was not only sliced but toasted as well. Extremely disappointed. 

Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches got a lot smaller but they still offer a half sandwich. I ordered a Greek salad that was supposed to have olives. There were maybe three olives. I'm very disappointed. I'll need to look for another place that has soups and salads."}
{"text":"Food is always good here, smoothies are excellent as well. It is way to small for the area, typical peak times are very crowded. Off hours during the week are good times to go..."}
{"text":"Loud employees shouting orders.  My french onion soup tasted like old broth.  My chicken panini was almost all cheese.  My cafe mocha looked nothing like the picture showed.  The cookies and cherry pastries were OK though.  Wish I could get my $50 back and go to a different Panera location.  Been to many and was never so disappointed."}
{"text":"Panera is one of my favorite places to eat. When it first opened, it was hard to find a parking spot, but now it's not SO bad. Boca Park is always busy, so parking is usually an issue, but it's cleared up a lot since it opened last year. The food can be a little inconsistent at times. Everytime I've gotten an apple as my side, it feels like it's on it's last day, it's kinda mushy and just not very tasty. Once in a while, the lettuce doesn't seem super fresh either. But for the most part, everything I get is delicious. My favorite sandwich is the asiago roast beef, without horseradish, and I've never been disappointed. All of their soup is great, too. 
Sometimes the service is also inconsistent. One day a cashier will be very friendly, the next day they seem a little distracted and impatient, not necessarily rude though. The food does come out quick, which is great for my lunch breaks. Overall, I'm really happy with this location and come for lunch often!"}
{"text":"Great service. Everyone is so friendly. I love going there to work. Great atmosphere. Soups are all great. I love the chicken with wild rice. It's amazing. I would recommend going there for your next lunch break."}
{"text":"Well look I say, I do not know if I've ever been in a bad their bread. But everyone that works

It is so friendly. The place is always immaculate. The food is always consistently good. It's one place I do like to hang out since I do work from home I do like to get away every once while and their bread is my choice I love the chicken and wild rice soup."}
{"text":"I miss Paradise Bakery.  Prices are much higher now that they converted to Panera.  Smaller portions and a confusing menu.  They are not honoring any points earned on the loyalty card from Paradise Bakery.  Gone are the BOGO cookies 

I am going to stick with Sauce for my salad fix."}
{"text":"Where are the Paneras of yesteryear? We always come in hopeful. The decor is promising and the place is filled with conversation. Then, your name is called and you're given a haphazard sandwich on a white microwaveable cardboard tray. If I wanted a hot pocket I'd... Scratch that. I don't want hot pockets. We're done here."}
{"text":"Very pleased with this location after the fee times I've visited. The staff is friendly and the drive thru is quick also. The tablets inside that allow you to order are easy to use and convenient. I will continue to come here."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast here this morning! When we went in there was a line, so the manager opened up a fill to speed up the line right away. The staff was friendly and smiling. The seating area was clean. There was more than enough seats, and the parking lot had more than enough spots. The food was fresh, and our caramel latte was great!"}
{"text":"Their Tuna sandwich is like Hors d'oeuvres or finger food, probably a tablespoon of tuna on some type of bread that was hard, I'm done with these high price Yummy sandwich shops ! No wonder their stock is way over 200 per share, the sell a 7.00 sandwich with 50 cents worth of ingredients 
I'm one & done ! I liked Paradise better.
The Thai salad was good, it was better when paradise made it."}
{"text":"Bad experience with dirty dishes and utensils at this Panera Bread.  After seeing my son's Mac and cheese bowl with dried up food in the bottom that was the last straw.  It was so bad we had to ask for a refund.  We will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"The food is always a treat at any Panera, but this time was a bit disappointing. The menu is so heavily geared towards items with avocados, yet they were completely out of them. No Green Goddess salad for me. Then when I finally chose something else and was ready to select a pastry, they were out of chocolate chip cookies. How can any bakery ever be out of chocolate chip cookies? Very disappointing visit today."}
{"text":"Not impressed!

I ordered a sun dried tomato boconchini sandwich- and it was just bread and tomato sauce.

I am not a big fan of chain sandwich shops- and this is why.

Generally lacks character."}
{"text":"This location is closest to my place in Spring Valley.  

Food is always fresh, and the service is always friendly and quick.  

Fuji apple salad is my favorite!
Perfect combo of sweet and tangy, and the fruits/veggie combo is really refreshing.

Tomato soup is always perfect.

My favorite location is the Boca Park just because of seating, but this one is suffice!"}
{"text":"Chipotle Chiken Avocado Melt is great! The employees are nice, and our order came in less than 5 minutes! I definitely will come back again to Panera, especially this branch."}
{"text":"I don't love and I don't hate Panera. I agree with most that it's over priced but I don't eat at most fast food places so when I need something quick I typically can get something from Panera. The majority of the food is healthier and their movie app makes it easy to navigate nutrition content. 

This location however always messes up! Busy or not! Whenever I catch it they'll usually replace it but sometimes not. 

I ordered a BBQ chicken flat bread and Greek salad. My BBQ chicken had a nice piece of paper that I mistook for cheese! I brought it to their attention and they made me another."}
{"text":"A great addition to Caste Village! This Panera just opened and already has a big crowd. It's nice and clean with fast service that you'd expect from a Panera! 

It does seem a bit small compared to other Panera's but it's still a nice addition to this shopping center."}
{"text":"One on every corner.

I mean they are nearly as bad as starbucks now.  Could you imagine that merger?  But seriously, delicious samiches and yummy-in-my-tummy soups.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way through town. We were kind of in a hurry so we asked how long it would take, and they said 10 min. After waiting 35 min I went up to the front counter to get a refund. There were still 10 orders ahead of ours!! They had been waiting for an hour and all wanted refunds. I expect better customer service- maybe offering a free treat or meal in the future but nothing. I love Panera and visit multiple locations across the U.S. However, I won't be returning to this one."}
{"text":"This Panera was a disaster the afternoon I visited.
-4 out of 6 order kiosks broken
-extremely slow service
-forgot one of our cafe drinks
-burned panini
-women's restroom was filthy (paper towels everywhere, out of toilet paper in one stall, water? all over the floor)
-watched an employee take out the trash and spray garbage water all over the floor and a table and chair, which was indifferently wiped up with a single towel

Best to avoid this one."}
{"text":"This is a nice location to the chain with several other stores nearby.. I decided to wait before doing my review so that I could see if they were consistent. I have come at several different times- breakfast, lunch, and late night and the staff are friendly and attentive. They actually appear to like their job which is pleasant. It's always clean. The WiFi is not the best but if your looking for WiFi Starbucks is always reliable. They food is fresh and delicious. It's noted that's it's all clean and natural. I would recommend this one if your deciding. If you never been to Panera they have a rewards program that varies with freebies or discounts based on your account. Good place."}
{"text":"I have always been a Panera fan. I'm hooked on many items on the menu. However, other than the expensive price they put on a quick service meal, I am extremely disappointed in the service I receive at this particular location in the Miracle Mile. Not only have the general waitstaff given attitudes for no good reason, so have the previous MANAGERS that I've had the unfortunate experience of being served by. Every week I walk in there, there's new people. I guess everyone hates their Job there. And have expressed it by giving attitudes to me more than once. I will say that I am not a complainer. I'll usually make the observation and keep it to myself. And the attitudes I've gotten multiple times were not over me causing a problem or being a nuisance customer. I am always polite and place my order as would anyone else. But sometimes the people are just downright rude. I'm not saying don't go here ever, but don't expect good service."}
{"text":"Came here because I needed a quick lunch, and panera bread on junction provided just that. I ordered the Fuji apple salad and turkey chili, and my pager buzzed before I could fill my coffee. Talk about fast service!

A lot of previous reviews suggest that this location has mastered the quick lunch. Though I'm not used to it, it is always appreciated when I need to eat and go. I had a negative experience the last time because I wanted to take my time and think about what I wanted to order. Disclaimer: Do not do that during lunch hour! I had a great lunch because I knew what I wanted and got it in minutes. 

I did what I promised: I came back and tried this location when it wasn't as busy. And I had a pretty good lunch. They didn't mess up any orders this time, and the woman who took my order took her time and didn't try to get rid of me right away. Though these aren't the only requirements I look for in a great lunch, Panera Bread on Junction is fast as everyone promises."}
{"text":"I ordered the famous cobb salad and the smoked turkey sandwich. The cashier was so attentive and was patient with me as it was my first time. The food took awhile to come but it was a pretty packed place. The salad and sandwich were delicious. Cobb salad had a good amount of ingredients. The sandwich was nicely made.

I went back and ordered a smoothie for my date and the second cashier, a much older gentlemen gave me a bit of attitude. I guess he didn't like the fact that I was ordering only a drink. I took 1 star off for this. He looked like he hated his job so much. 

I will return to Panera Bread but maybe not this location. 4 ****"}
{"text":"There portions are too small for me...I need to order two meals to not be hungry by 5pm.

The food is good, but for the cost to not be hungry after the meal at this place I would rather go somewhere nicer.

I like the greek sandwich and you cannot go wrong with most of the soups."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly enough and the place was clean. The food is always great so I was not upset about having to drive for half of my break to get a nice big chicken cesar salad but when I got back to the office I had no dressing. So..my dry salad was definitely not worth the trip. I don't think I'll be going back to this location. :/"}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying I love Panera food! It's literally in my Top 5 places for quick, healthy, options.  However, today was a mess at this location. 

Their location is in a prime spot and always very busy.  I come in on a Saturday afternoon a little before 2pm. The line was short only about 2 people in front of me. However the person at the register had multiple questions. Now by this time I had at least 2 new people behind me. The poor lady at the register was by herself. Why was that when I finally got to the register she actually got some help.  

I love Panera Bread and normally service is good. But i would to go to other Charlotte locations for better service."}
{"text":"First, I will preface by saying I love Panera Bread! However, my experience on Friday for lunch wasn't what I used to..food was excellent, but my order was wrong. I ordered a Grilled Cheese and Broccoli Cheddar Soup. I received a Tomato Basil Soup. Granted it was tasty, but after the manager checked my bag and handed it to me saying everything was perfect, I was slightly displeased that it was wrong. I had a meeting and couldn't go back to get the correct soup.


The store made up for it on Monday by comping my lunch, which was awesome. A pleasant surprise and awesome turnaround for the store..that's why they get a 5 store. Manager Jess was beyond accommodating!"}
{"text":"Frustrated with this place. Their breakfast is good but my order is always missing some component"}
{"text":"I should have read my yelp info first. Ran in to get a Latta. Serve wasn't the nicest and it was a problem for her to swipe my Panera card. Paid for a Lrg Latta 5.10 later I should have gone to Starbucks. Yep, I paid for this visit but learned my lesson. Panera in Gastonia not for me."}
{"text":"As of today, June 14 2017 they are closed. There was no proper notification of closure to customers and I drove here from miles away. Disappointed in the conversion from Paradise Bakery to Panera. No longer maintains the same standards as before. Perhaps they will re-open after desert ridge mall update- no signage so wouldn't hold your breath either!"}
{"text":"Just did the \"rapid pick-up\" order... Let me just say that it seemed like they tried to get my order wrong.. I spend over 50$ on food for my family and ended up getting half of the things I ordered wrong and forgot to give me my drink. I'm quite confused on how you can mess up an order especially when it's on a screen right in front of your face.. I will not be returning to this Panera Bread location and is really making me question using the rapid pick-up order again.. Not a happy customer"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken Thai salad to go and I was disappointed to come home and see they forgot to put chicken in my salad!  Avoid this location and go to the chick filet next door."}
{"text":"A bit loud to work here but overall is a decent place to grab a quick bite 
Serve order is a bit slow 
But cashiers are very nice with full of energy
Environment is dirty here table are never clean."}
{"text":"To anyone who is hesitant, let me preach:
1/2 sandwich- get the turkey cranberry (only a fool would choose otherwise)
1/2 soup- all of them are grade A fancy to the max
FREE COOKIE?! This chocolate chip cookie is more than a food article; it's an experience. Prepare yourself for the most mouth-watering, precious dessert God has graced this earth with. And weep, dear soul, for now you are nourished with the greatest cookie in human history. Wipe away that single glorious tear from your face and smile, food warrior. Until you meet again."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  I ordered black bean soup but since they were running low and too lazy to warm up more, they gave me a partial portion and filled it with (what I hope was just) water to make up the volume.  Once I got home and began to eat it IT TASTED TERRIBLE!!  It was beans with a layer of dirty looking water.  I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager who treated me like I was a bother to her.  I was so insulted!  No apology.  That was worse than the soup!  I will NEVER spend another penny at this panera!!!!"}
{"text":"I like this Panera Bread.  I like it better than the lo action on Happy Valley mainly because the parking situation is better.  And when I say it's \"better\", what I mean is that you don't need a can opener in order to get into your car.  If you've read my previous reviews, you'll know I'm a fan of ample parking and large parking stalls.  Door dings in the mighty city of Phoenix run rampant and I do what I can to alleviate them.  [end rant]

This particular location has plenty of ample parking.  The location is clean as is the restroom.  My only minor gripe is that for some reason whenever I eat inside of a Panera Bread, the empty tables have not been wiped down.  They're clear, but not clean.  I really don't like having to set my plate down on a pile of crumbs from the previous person who was sitting where I am.  eeeew.  Not a huge deal, but still kinda gross.  Last I checked, my paycheck ain't signed by Panera Bread.  I shouldn't have to do the job.  Just my two pennies.

Otherwise, the turkey, bacon, avocado BLT is pretty much my go-to sandwich when I eat here.  The crispy bacon combined with the fresh, creamy avocado in conjunction with the fresh turkey make it my favorite.  The best part of the sandwich is the fresh turkey.  It isn't sandwich meat turkey.  It's not paper thin Carl Buddig lunch meat.  It's actual chunks of fresh white turkey meat.  All of that in addition to a couple of fat slabs of ripe tomato and some fresh green lettuce!  Healthy and delicious!  

My meal with a fountain soda was $13.  Approximately two and a half times the cost of a 6\" tuna at Subway.  Obviously, the meal at Panera Bread is a step up.  It's more like a café with awesome food.  You can kick back with your laptop, enjoy your sandwich, sip your iced tea & write your Yelp review 'til your hearts content.  So to re-cap... super clean location, plenty of parking and room to stretch out with your dinner and do some work, if need be.  Or just enjoy your dinner and slack off on the Internet like I did.  Either way, Panera Bread is a great place with good, healthy food options in a relaxed atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Lunch time!  Just like most of you, I'm a member of the Panera Bread rewards program.  Sign up online or in person at the restaurant and you're suddenly opened up to a world of discounts, coupons and free offers!  WIN/WIN!  I got an e-mail from them out of a blue - \"FREE SANDWICH!\"   SCORE!  Who in the heck doesn't want a free sandwich?  ...pretty much the only reason why I came here is because of the free sandwich offer.  Mind you, I've frequented Panera Bread in Minnesota, Wisconsin and now, Arizona.  I've got dozens and dozens of visits to my name and have never and I mean, never so much as had anything but a positive, normal experience.  

This location is conveniently located right off I-17 & Happy Valley.  There are a TON of shops wedged in this relatively small area so parking is at a premium.  It's no fault of Panera Bread's, but I absolutely loathe this parking lot.  The layout is awkward, the parking stalls are fairly small and overall, it's just cramped.  Again, no fault of Panera Bread's but there is A LOT going on in this little shopping area.

When you walk into the restaurant at this location (and most of them I've been to), you're immediately greeted with the treat counter.  And what I mean by \"treat\", is the plethora of fresh-baked pastries, cookies, muffins and other goodies.  *mmm*  The restaurant was clean and the restrooms were also equally clean.  Plenty of seating and everyone is always willing to assist, when need be.  I placed this particular order to-go after running several errands this morning.

My all-time favorite sandwich at Panera Bread is their Roasted Turkey, Bacon & Avocado sandwich.  For a treat, I opted for a fresh cherry pastry.  I raced home as quick as I could where I could not wait to devour this lunch.  So about this sandwich...  did I mention the bread is also baked fresh daily?  I'll start there.  The bread is beyond fresh and soft and so delicious!  The turkey isn't your typical paper-thin Carl Buddig lunch meat chock full of nitrates.  No, sir!  This is fresh chunks of real turkey meat seasoned to perfection.  On top of the turkey are several slices of bacon and on top of all that bacon and turkey are fresh slices of real avocado.  This isn't an avocado spread.  This isn't a watered down guacamole.  These are thick, fresh slices of REAL avocado.  Mouth watering yet?  On top of the bread, turkey, bacon and avocado are a few slabs of sliced tomato and several hearty pieces of fresh lettuce.  One heckuva sandwich, right?  Not only is it an awesome sandwich, but it's good for you!  How can something built that awesome be so good for you?  YUM!  Next to the sandwich is a fresh pickle spear coupled with a small bag of potato chips.  Such an awesome lunch!

After I devoured the sandwich, I inhaled a fresh cherry pastry.  Very fresh, light and delicious (check out my pics!)  For a quick, awesome (and healthy) lunch or dinner, I would not hesitate to opt for Panera Bread!  It's the perfect choice if you have an active lifestyle!  Let them do the cooking and preparation and I'm certain you'll be pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I can never wake up in time for their breakfast items!  But everything else is delicious.  What sets Panera Bread apart from all the other restaurants is the nice and chill atmosphere.  The Lake Mead location is no exception.  

My most recent visit I had their new Steak and White Cheddar Panini w/Tomato soup in a bread bowl and chips.  I always go with the Napa Almond Chicken Salad (it's a sandwich!) if there's nothing new on the menu.  It doesn't matter if I come here at noon or at 9pm, the food always tastes fresh and service top notch."}
{"text":"The service is usually good and the food is delicious and great portions.  I always go here with my grandma."}
{"text":"Went through drive through..  after telling the girl 3 items, she stated o I'm sorry I wasn't paying attention.    After I shook my head I started over and still had to repeat it 2 more times.   Paid over 40 bucks for 3 sandwiches and a kids meal.     The sandwiches came out looking squashed.   I frequently go to the arrowhead location which is amazing.    Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed by the soup here and the Pick 2 lunch is a fabulous deal. Love the option of a pastry for $.99 with your order too!"}
{"text":"Love the Pick 2 lunch option! You get the best of both worlds by choosing two items from the soup, salad and sandwiches. It's plenty of food for a lunch break and all of their prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"So sad seeing the poor reviews for this location. I have been here many times over the years, but my review is based on my most recent experiences this month (May 2015). I had one dine in (late lunch) and one take out (dinner) experience. Both experiences were just fine. Did not have to wait long in line either time. Staff interaction is hit or miss. On first visit, the person taking our order was just kinda indifferent, it seemed. On the second visit, the cashier was WONDERFUL. Orders were executed correctly and quickly. Was pleasantly surprised by the side of the orders. Food tasted great like always. There was apparently an issue with the ladies bathroom during our first visit and a customer was complaining about it, but I don't really know what it was about. One complaint- they don't have the baked potato soup and garden vegetable soup often enough. Going twice, my dad couldn't get either during either visit. Big bummer for him."}
{"text":"If you love bagels, definitely hit up Panera.  My favorites are their cinnamon toast crunch and asiago cheese!  The cinnamon toast crunch is really popular, so come early or else they may be out of it.  So so so yummy!  Their sandwiches and soups are pretty good, too.  Another plus, is their free Wi-Fi.  It's a great place to study on a weekend!"}
{"text":"I love Panera, but not this one. 

If you want to use the catering service select a different cafe. Each and every time I ordered catering there was an issue and I order catering often. 

I usually write lengthy reviews but I refuse to spend a significant amount of time on this store. It's my hopes that someone will hear the complaints of your customers and get this store and it's manager some serious training. 

For now, I use the Panera on Cedar Rd. and have had no issues. I suggest any catering customers do the same."}
{"text":"@panerabread #HEARTLAND #PANERA #BROTHBOWLS #YELPGTA

I know a lot of people are upset with Panera because of the prices. However, I feel like the prices are well justified - think McDonalds, but better and healthier. Those small portions are good for you! 

Now, by no means am I a Panera expert, especially because I've tried just one item. I had the tortellini and although small, it wasn't bad. It came with a tiny bag of chips. My friend ordered a sandwich - it came with an apple and a pickle - and it looked dry and not so good. 

The positives about this location - it's big and nice with ample seating and a good amount of sunlight through the windows. Definitely a good place to grab a bite on a winter afternoon (which is what I did). 

However, I am not crooning or craving, so I think I'll probably have to pass on coming back."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Horrible parking, freezing temperature and overly loud music. The business people that take calls on their computers, speaker phones and conduct business meetings loudly at their tables with no regard for anyone around them are jerks. So annoying."}
{"text":"Wow. Probably some of the rudest service I've had in a long time. The shift supervisor dealt with a customer before me who was understandably upset about the kitchen forgetting to put pasta in her pasta dish. Thrown off her a-game by that, the employee was very annoyed to take my order. Two star rating is because the food was fine, but service like this is unacceptable."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place and when I eat on site I like the food and the staff is very pleasant (although can someone explain to me why they ask for a tip at the counter and then you still have to pick up your own food?)

The 2 stars are actually a reflection of the catering/to go.  My last large catering order was incorrect (wrong sandwiches), and the sandwiches were overall mediocre....(do they just not travel well because they look and taste better on site.)  To add to my frustration when asked for my feedback in a follow up survey I never received a response.   Disappointing."}
{"text":"Horrible. With my job I ordered a bowl. I received a salad. Ok. Fine so I wasn't going to complain until I tasted the salad. It claimed to have edamame, red peppers, wontons and chicken.  Welling came with edamame, red peppers, extra won tons and NO CHICKEN. the salad was disgusting to say the least. How hard is it to add chicken to a salad. Like that's the key ingredient and they missed it. The salad dressing was bitter. The red peppers were soggy. I just can't with this place. This is the third time something I've ordered from there was wrong. The last time it was chicken noodle soup that looked more like chicken broth. No noodle or chicken or nothing. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this location a few times since it's the closest to my office. I did a large lunch order a few weeks ago and when I called to see why it hadn't arrived was told that they had someone call in and were behind on deliveries. I had to come pick the food up which still took another 10 minutes to be completed. When I told them I needed to change the tip I had done online I got major attitude from them. There have been a couple of other times that orders were incorrect or late and yesterday I ordered a small pickup order for a meeting at my office. Two of the five orders were steak and egg sandwiches and neither had egg on them. When I called to complain I was told to order directly thru the manager next time and she would \"take care of the order\" ok, so does that mean it's free or that she will double check it for me? I'm not sure that there will be another order from this location. 
As a side note, the location at 7th Street and Bell ALWAYS gets my order correct."}
{"text":"Had food catered by this Panera location for a meeting I was hosting at my job. Delivery driver spilled half of the soups that we ordered in the parking lot. When asked about getting the money for the spilled soups refunded, we were instructed to call the Panera directly. Called them and got the run around about getting a refund because they wanted the card number again. It was a company card that our director was in possession of, and he wasn't in the office; so I waited until the following day to call back.

When I called the following day I was made to feel like I was being less than reasonable for wanting a refund for the spilled soup. The lady brought up how it spilled in transit. I felt bad for the delivery driver; but that doesn't change the fact that we ended up short on soup for half of our guests. I also advised the lady that we did not receive baguettes for the soup we ordered. She told me they were packed in the bag (which they weren't) and proceeded to try to explain what a baguette was as if I didn't know. At that point, I was over it, and I asked for a refund for the spilled soup as well as the $20 tip charged to the card prior to service. She seemed surprised, possibly even insulted. I'm not saying accidents don't happen, but what ever happened to taking the initiative to make things right when a paying customer doesn't get what they paid for? Definitely will not be ordering from this Panera again under any circumstances."}
{"text":"Paradise continues to surprise me with their healthy, smart sized offerings.  This time it was for breakfast and I had the Mediterranean but requested it on their whole wheat bread instead of the ciabatta (which they were happy to do).  Light roast coffee tasted a little off but when staff was notified they began attending to it right way."}
{"text":"I especially enjoy this Panera location.  The staff here is über friendly and patient, especially if you're not sure what you're in the mood for that day.  Besides the variety of breads and bagels that I enjoy, the sierra turkey is a favorite of mine. 

Also, this is probably one of the best lunch options in the area."}
{"text":"I called just to ask a question about the menu and I was hung up on in the middle of my sentence. I called a second time because I could have been wrong and our connection was lost, nope. He hung up on me again. I even called a third time. Whoever this was should be fired, this is ridiculous. The question could've taken maybe a few seconds to answer but I guess hanging up on me over and over would suffice, huh?"}
{"text":"This is one my wife's new favorites.  Most everything on the menu is tasty.  I was not a fan of their baked desserts,  but the soups, salads, and sandwiches are delicious every time we go."}
{"text":"Its a great place for a quiet meal on a Sunday afternoon. Anyplace in the \"city\" is nice on a Sunday afternoon. I can't imagine the zoo that it is mon-fri at lunchtime.
The food is reasonably priced,  tastey and the service was good.
The 3 bums hanging around outside panhandling??? Not so much!
Such is life in hipster central ....."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. How can you possibly run out of Asiago bagels on a Saturday morning at 9:30. You can also tell that the people working here work here would rather be anywhere else. They can't be bothered to even acknowledge you when you walk in. I'd go out of my way to go to any other Panera Bread in the area."}
{"text":"Service was great but the lunch menu is not worth the $ spent. Would have been better off going to subway."}
{"text":"This place have a horrible service...the manager and staff are rude I order a sandwich it come out cold and I told them they look at me like I'm lying and want some for free this is  suppose  to be healthy food and it's not cheap i have been to panera a lot this is one of the awful place to go to..never again go to this place again  if they don't do anything to make it better this place will go out of business soon"}
{"text":"Only order on the board and my hot sandwich sat there while it took 10 minutes to prepare my oatmeal. Maybe if the employees focused on their jobs instead of personal conversation they could get the food out in a timely manner! One of many disappointments and definitely my last! I'm DONE!!! You've finally lost this customer for good!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous wait at drive up with only one car ahead of me. Wrong order repeated back to me at window. Told her what it should be. Still received the wrong food. This place has had many issues in the past. Lost me as a customer for good!"}
{"text":"After over 5 years of coming here, I am giving this bakery 2 stars due to the last 5 visits that I have had with them. I come early in the morning, I do a \"Rapid\" online order...which allows me to pick my items up without speaking to anyone (because I don't talk in the morning until 8:32am).....but each and every time I have come over this last month and a half I have had to wait for my order, or they don't have what I have requested and take it amongst themselves to substitute for me without asking. I LOVE Panera...for myself as well as for team breakfasts, but the service has gone DOWN major over time...and it's sad to see. I manage a team in a large healthcare organization and it is my responsibility to be in point and look for issues and work on quality and best practices....I'm asking that their manager do the same...the morning shift is full of young girls who take issue with doing their jobs when asked!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I got my dimples pierced at Kat Like Us, and I need to eat soft foods and a basically liquid diet. I decided a good soup would hit the spot. After moving here from L.A., I didn't think there was a Panera here. Thanks to Yelp, I found one only 12 miles from my house. A cheddar broccoli bread bowl hit the spot! Of course I paired it with a ice cold, Jones cream soda. The service was friendly, the place was clean, and food came fast. I love this place. Once I can eat regular food again, I can't wait to go back for the 1/2 sandwich and soup for $6.95. Also the bread itself looked sooooo good, and I know its great from previous tastings. Can't go wrong here for a quick, healthy meal."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and ordered the Sierra Turkey 1/2 sandwich on asiago foccacia bread & broccoli cheddar soup in a bread bowl :) Amazing, and filling. No wonder its packed at lunch time. I'd eat here a few times a week if it was closer. Yum!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere service can be slow because this location gets busy but the food is still good"}
{"text":"Located on rancho and Sahara right off the 15! Pros: healthy options! I love that they have those awesome (but somewhat unhealthy) soups and bread bowls/sandwiches.. but also awesome salads and protein bowls. I went with the Thai chicken salad and it was great! Tons of flavor, the regular size was super filling, and this location makes it convenient to pick up and go! Order online to make it easier to just pick up and go from their rapid pick up"}
{"text":"Great Panera location. Clean, friendly service, fresh food. I like the Asian Sesame salad. Just tried the creamy tomato soup. Very tasty."}
{"text":"I didn't come here for long time. 
I dropped my dog off at let smart and I was looking for coffee.  I could go Starbucks but I wanna have some sweet bakery .
Coffee was okay not amazing and they just give you cup and u put coffee at the bar. They had 3 choice which is light coffee dark coffee and decaf coffee. 
I'm not sure what brand of coffee they didn't show
Small coffee was $2. 
Cobblestone was $2.79"}
{"text":"I came in here specifically by name as one of my favorite bakeries. I'm on a visit to Toronto with family and I felt like having a morning coffee and cookie here.

The place is well kept, but can tell that it's been around the block for a bit.

The service was great."}
{"text":"I go out of my way to dine at this Panera. The staff is super friendly and seem to work with such fluidity. I got a salad and asked for no cheese but it still came with it. They were so nice and apologetic about it. The manager, Chris, even gave me a pastry for free!! We all know Panera has great food but if customer service matters to you, this location is where to go!"}
{"text":"Coffee is very important to me in the morning and sometimes a pastry, and they make a mean muffin. I was in a hurry this morning and drive past this location in the morning, so I can go in or even have my order ready by the time I get there at Panera. Their bakery department is so extensive that an individual must usually buy two pastries to curb the urge. 

The staff was super friendly this morning and always is. Their store is welcoming and warm like an extension of my own kitchen. I ended up with a blueberry muffin and a croissant.  Both pastries were impeccable and fluffy soft. The coffee was drip and very strong that I flavored myself with cream and sugar from there bar. Then sat for about ten minutes enjoyed the muffin and coffee in their dining room for a small moment to myself."}
{"text":"Let me say this unequivocally - PANERA Bread is a rip-off High end loot Take this for example 6-7\" of sandwiches, on very thinly sliced bread for $10.99 Stale ingredients, leftovers ate pass-overs and they expect you to eat it. Next, 6oz of soup for $4.79 I haven't seen a bigger loot Then, my receipt says 'Treat on us if we make a mistake' How about giving me Tomato Mozzarella Flatbread instead of Tomato Basil Bread. Where is my treat? I didn't get even after asking. Then the lady who made my order, so called manager and probably the owner wanted to give me their both wrong orders just because they would otherwise throw it Give it to your hungry Mama damn it, I don't need no charity. 

Nett net, Never Ever Panera Ever 6\" sandwich for $10.88 and I thought Subway sucked!"}
{"text":"Panera is such a fantastic place to eat and gather with friends and family  This is my first visit to this location and was not let down. Our homeschooling group was taking part in a bakers class just for kids Parents were allowed to be present.  But the chef decided that it would be best to let the kids go into the kitchen and learn about baking themselves. 

This is a great way for children to learn about how important the ingredients are and what additives that are in our food. Panera uses vegetables in there frosting maybe that is why their pastries taste so good our bodies need the veggie count. 

While the kiddos did baking for this hour and half class the adults ordered food so it was like a big banquet and I am so pleased for Panera allowing us to gather in there restaurant and caught up. The atmosphere of the store was vibrant and uplifting for all!"}
{"text":"Not wanting the typical fast food choices decided to have dinner at a restaurant that serves \"real\" food. Beware once an individual decides to go Panera there is no substitute. With this being my first experience at this location I was extremely excited to try the food and atmosphere that Panera delivers continually to its customers. 

This store still has that new building scent. The decor of the restaurant is amazing. The booths are so comfortable. The lighting is fantastic and the natural hues of wood that they use make this location amazing. The carpet is even soft and fluffy. When they built and designed this location of Panera, I feel they wanted the customer to feel at home. Which it does the restaurant just needs tele's.

As I sit here and eat my dinner I have yet to be surprised again with the use of new technology and how Panera is using it. The guest may sit down at their table and order online from the table itself. Basically, the Panera table in the restaurant is the destination of the order. I checked it out you put the table number in that you sit at. How wonderful! Plus, when you decide to order one can do it on a new kiosk electronically in the store, or the good old fashioned way with a real human.

I decided to have the Caesar salad which was very filling and delicious. The Caesar dressing had that proper balance of tang to it. The lettuce was crisp and fresh too. The croutons are made by hand here and one could taste the quality of this. For dessert I ordered a sugar cookie that was in the shape of a tulip. The frosting of the tulip sugar cookie was amazing. This cookie was very soft and fresh. I enjoy knowing what I am eating for these reasons why I continue to trust Panera with the excellence they constantly deliver."}
{"text":"After having lunch I figured it could be timed for dessert. The selection on pastries and cookies is so extensive here and makes for better moods. I know that sugar is bad for you, but when life deals lemons eat chocolate it makes it better. 

The staff here is so helpful despite the machines that they are being replaced with machines for ordering. The new ordering technologies that they are using are very easy to use and more accurate than the human staff sometimes. You have to be the judge if that."}
{"text":"First time visitor. Regular at another Panera. 
Issues included

a long wait, e people in front of me and I still waited over 10 minutes to order. 
While I waited I noticed 3-5 people around the coffee station. Dark and light were empty.
Got my turn to order. I got the new simple egg with bacon and cheese. It was cold. I went to get coffee and again regularly and light were out.
Speed of service wAs horrible. What breakfast place does not have at least a light or dark roast coffee available constantly?
How hard is it to make and sandwich  when  everything is pre made already 

Poor 


In summary, go to Starbucks"}
{"text":"The food is okay, everything tasted a bit saltier than i would like it to be. The soups are not fresh made in the kitchen, they are the same soups other restaurants order from a supplier. 
Currently eating beside a pule of dishes because they are under staffed, no one here to clean up the messes."}
{"text":"They almost always mess up the order with the wrong food being sent out or 8/10 deliveries there is forgotten items. Good quality food, poor production. Need to be double checking orders to avoid a simple issue. Panera is overall a good experience. But for what you're paying there should be no mishaps!"}
{"text":"I love the location of this Panera, it's always filled with the most interesting people. Great baked goods, the bagels are pretty amazing, I get the multigrain or the whole wheat. Great coffee, awesome dark roasts. A bit expensive, but much healthier than Micky D's and Wendy's."}
{"text":"With Pittsburgh's lack of Bagel places, Panera fits the bill perfectly. Asiago Cheese bagels are some of the best i've ever eaten. Try toasting them under the broiler then rubbing them with a little raw garlic and dip into a good extra virgin olive oil.

Great soups and sandwiches. Good people at the counter!"}
{"text":"I love Panara, I hear some bad things about management but I don't believe the rumors. Anyway, Pittsburgh is sorely missing good bagel places and Panara comes through not only with bagels, but other great, fresh bakery items. 

Good soups and sandwiches, being vegan I love their offerings. Good coffee too, they have a french roast that puts Starbucks to shame."}
{"text":"Great as far as a Panera is. Fresh baked breads, muffins, cookies, bagels, soups and sandwiches. My go to place at Settlers Ridge for a quick lunch of a whole wheat bagel, jelly and that delicious, rich French Roast they serve here."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem of Panera's ! Fireplace could roar a bit more, but otherwise great set up and pretty secluded. Plenty of space to work in peace

I might've missed the memo, but pretty lame to have to pay a meter to park for extended hours of working. Not cool panera, where's the free lot ?! Fill a girl in (:"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service, good food and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Non-era (bread outage) I've visited this panera a few times for dinner and there has been a dough or bread shortage. They should disclose to customers bread available during open to 5pm only."}
{"text":"First time at Panera Bread, had a ham and cheese on Rye  with chicken and wild rice soup and ordered a mocha latte. My sandwich and soup came in very short order and both were scrumptious! Sadly my latte was not ready until I had finished my lunch. They just set it on the counter and I would not have known it was ready unless I asked. The sandwich was chockablock with ham an cheese , the soup thick and seasoned perfectly. I like their to go cups for lattes , it is an ingenious design with a toothpick like design to fit in the steam hole which adds added safety to help you keep from burning your mouth! I will continue to go there because everything is FRESH and beats fast food all to heck! This is a great place!!"}
{"text":"How does a Panera Bread get an overall score of 1 star?  Go there to find out.  You will never forget it.  Why JAB Holding Company doesn't do something about this location is anyone's guess.  I wish I could give it less than one star. 

Full disclosure:  The *food* (that we actually got) was fine.  :-O"}
{"text":"Congrats Paradise bakery at Norterra, you convinced me to never go to another Paradise bakery for as long as I live. Second time now you've given us old food that has sat out. Croissant should not be hard, pesto Sachettini also should not be hard.  Two kids meals which both came with yogurt only got one yogurt. And a top it all off the best part of Paradise bakery is the cookies and, Upon arriving home we found no cookies for the three meals that are supposed to include cookies. I don't expect stellar food every time I go to Paradise bakery, However this location is the most inconsistent restaurant I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Panera is a great healthy place to relax with friends and fills your tummy up... Not to lie panera is extremely delicious everything on there menu is except the prices are a little much. But I guess you really do get what you pay for which is a great meal"}
{"text":"Growing up in SoCal, I loved going to Panera! I would go after school and do my homework (using their free wifi) while drinking soup and eating half a sandwich! 

Finding a Panera so close to home here in Vegas, I got very excited...but also was quickly letdown. 

The food is great. It's consistent and I cannot complain but the service...man. When our food runner came by with our sandwiches she forgot which one she was holding and got irritated when we told her what it probably was. Then when we noticed that the soup was broccoli cheddar versus the chicken noodle we ordered, she suddenly became very defensive and started blaming the cook for cooking the wrong one when we weren't accusing her in the first place. Especially since we also work in the service industry, we hate it when we encounter rude guests/customers so we make sure that we don't become those rude customers when we go out. Sigh, it's just weird and not ideal to have a server to not be knowledgeable of the products she's serving or be so defensive when we were just politely asking her to double check our food. 

Disappointed but at least I enjoyed my sandwich~"}
{"text":"Sandwich was 1/2 the size of the picture and flattened completely. Used the kiosk and was supposed to get a free cookie, waitress was annoyed when we asked.

Tons of dirty tables, crumbs in the booth we sat in, table was sticky. Run very poorly."}
{"text":"They have really good sandwiches and offer chips, apple or bread as a side.  I love their paninis too.  This was my first time at this location. I told my parents how good they were and took them there while they were in town.  But unfortunately they messed up all of our orders and we all got a sandwich other than what we ordered.  It was frustrating but we didn't say anything because we were hungry and didn't want to wait any longer. I hope the next experience will be a better one."}
{"text":"I came in today at 1:00pm and ordered a You-Pick-Two combo and a water cup. It was pretty busy inside and people were filtering in and out. 1:30 rolled around and I didn't mind waiting because I know how busy it was, but I was starting to get really hungry. I decided to approach the front to ask if something happened to my order. Fortunately a manager was the first person to help me out, he realized I had been waiting half an hour for my food.  He asked the staff to get my order out immediately AND offered me a free large beverage and a free pastry. I really only wanted my food I ordered, but he insisted on the free drink and pastry. I went to fill up my drink, came back to my table and my food was right there waiting for me. Thank you kind sir for helping me out and going beyond what you needed to do to please a customer! I have always loved Panera Bread and today I loved it even more!"}
{"text":"I think of Panera Bread as comfort food for me.  The food here reminds me of food you'd get at a Bed & Breakfast.  Or, food your neighbor's cousin's sister's mom use to make when you were a kid.  The menu is basically sandwiches, soups, and salads. But there's enough on the menu to satisfy almost everyone.  One thing about Panera Bread is that their food is always fresh and price is even better.  You can even getaway with a sandwich and soup for less than $10.  My order is usually the same...turkey something.  Either I'm getting a turkey in a panini or their smoked turkey sandwich.  Also don't be surprised if I get my turkey with extra meat.  

The restaurant itself, along with their service, is always right on.  I tend to frequent Panera Breads that are located inside shopping malls, which tend to be smaller. So you can imagine the shock when I walk into a freestanding or strip mall PB.  I had a great time on my last visit, more of those great times to come.

{"text":"So this location just opened near my place of employment and for some reason they never know how to give you the correct salad out of the drive thru also they hand it to you freezing cold, chicken and everything. I submitted a complaint because I was unsure if the chicken was even cooked through at all and they issued me credit online but that's about it. Went back again today and I got a salad with no chicken, again cold as ice but the sandwich I ordered was delicious. Maybe it's just the salads?"}
{"text":"Now that cooler temps are here, I have found myself hooked on soup from Panera... And this is my favorite Panera location in town. 

The staff is always very friendly and helpful, and I even when I go during the lunch rush there is rarely a long wait. The eating area is kept clean, the only thing that could make this panera better is the parking area can get a little crazy at times. 

I don't particularly care for the \"soup schedule\" (soups that are available one day aren't necessarily available the following day), but it is very rare that Panera doesn't have a soup that appeals to me every time I go in. And I really love that the employees will let you sample the soups if you are having a hard time deciding which to get!

Nine times out of ten, I go with the 'Pick 2', which allows you to select soup and half a sandwich, or soup and salad, or 2 soups, or a sandwich and salad... you get the idea. I've never been disappointed with what I ordered in terms of flavor or portion size. 

I typically get my food to go from Panera, but every so often I eat in and this is a pretty cozy spot to do so. I always see people working away on their laptops. 

I am definitely a fan of Panera, and this specific location in particular."}
{"text":"Came here for a downtown dinner and the location was perfect. Easy to to find and a short walk from the Embassy Suites hotel and NASCAR museum. We were greeted and quickly placed our order.

The food was very typical of other PBs so no surprises! The quality was just as good as others. 

I can highly recommend this location when staying or working in the downtown Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"Don't state you are open until 10pm sunday online and then say your closed at 9:15 when we walk in. If you close at 9pm on Sundays it should be shown as such online and your doors should be locked at 9pm. Walked inside this place I've been to numerous times and employees ignored me and my boyfriend for a few minutes before they told us they were closed 15 minutes ago."}
{"text":"I am not really sure why, but I had never been to a Panera Bread before this past weekend. I was going to the mall to return an item and had a rumbly tummy, so I decided to give them a try... 

My tuna salad sandwich was basic, the best part was the honey wheat bread... I guess I should have expected as much considering where I was eating! The tomato soup was better, I really enjoyed the croutons that came in it. My iced chai latte was excellent, but rather small for the price... 

Overall it was an ok lunch experience. I found Panera to be on the pricey side for what they offer, so I am unsure how quickly I will return."}
{"text":"I never have an issue with this location. However today my Mac and cheese was really watery, like it had been heated too quickly and not enough time to solidify into the usual Mac and cheese consistency. Im a nut for your green tea. And the cinnamon crunch scones are to die for."}
{"text":"Great service!
Coffee was good
Greek salad, red velvet cupcake, and the chocolate chip coconut coockie were great ;)

By the way they have special pink ribbon bagel! I like this place!"}
{"text":"I was lucky that no one pulled behind me, after waiting ten minutes in the drive thru without any movement I opted to go in. 
It's way too extra. The set up is weird. Paradise Bakery wasn't broken so why all the changes? 
I won't complain that it's over priced, I mean I pay for the convenience but for goodness sakes! If you wanna charge over 5 bucks for a small order of mac & cheese, can you fill the container? 
I won't be back ever again."}
{"text":"Been a few times. won't be back. Disclaimer - I never liked Shops on Don Mills and seldom have good experience at any business there - but it's on my way home so occasionally I give it another chance.

This Panera location is chronically understaffed at the front counter. Counter is often abandoned for person to multi-task at prep, cleaning, replenishing or discussing something in the kitchen. Have walked in a few times and stood around 2-3 minutes unattended. Other times waited unacceptably long because attendant was multi-tasking. Sometimes Manager is present for this and continues to be absorbed in his tasks without even apologizing or empathizing with the customers in line. People have also forced to wait while cassier conducts personal conversation with in Tagalog with already served customer.  Half the time I give up and go to the Starbucks next door. 

Coffee is OK but nothing special, seems a bit watery, and the Decaff is not available half the time. Pastries are good but my favorite Pumpkin Muffin is not available half the time. 

Ordered food once - made mistake of getting Grilled Chees without reading description - Processed Cheese - really? What is this the 1980's? A place with the slogan \"food as it should be\" shouldn't be having processed cheese under it's roof??  Was curious about the Black Bean soup & Chipotle Chicken Sandwich, but I don't think I'll bother."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery..COME BACK! Couldn't find a table and not because they were busy..because seven tables were dirty. Four of us ordered the breakfast sandwiches. All four of us agreed poor quality eggs, stale bread and very bland. Avacado was literarlly hard as a rock. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"WHY? Why would they be out of the most popular bagel Cinnamon Crunch on a Sat morning at 8:30am? There are two empty trays. Plenty bagels available that don't sell but zero of the two most requested! Simple solution...make double batches of the most popular so you don't have to tell one customer after another \"sorry, we're out\".  We asked for the egg white sandwich on Asiago Bagel, waited 15 mins and they brought us egg sandwiches on focaccia bread! Yikes, no wonder 1.5 stars"}
{"text":"Two stars since the egg bagel sandwich was amazing but their staff is horrible! Two different customers complaining that no one was helping them, they were out of THREE carafes of coffee, out of half and half. Had to ask cashier twice for help. Six tables were filthy dirty. Learn how to hire and supervise your employees!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I continue to give Panera chances to win. They are a huge fail. This morning, after a doctor appt, I passed a Starbucks and drove to this Panera. Big mistake. They were out of cinnamon crunch bagels so I settled for pumpkin. Then they were out of honey walnut cream cheese so I settled for plain. I also ordered a chai tea latte. Wish they would have been out of that!  Bagel was ok, cream cheese was less than mediocre and the latte was poured out. Those things cost $7.15!  Their prices are too high for the sorry quality food they serve. I have given Panera their last chance."}
{"text":"Not one employee had a smile on their face.horrible customer service! The place is dirty.. the bathrooms were gross. Vegetables were at least a day old ! The food is Soo not worth the price. I'll never come back here again ."}
{"text":"Really like this place.  Food is great, staff is excellent.  Service is fast and friendly.  Atmosphere is warm and inviting.  There is ONE thing I wish they would change though - the music.  There is a loop of music that plays endlessly.  It seems like I only hear the same 4 songs or so over and over and over again.  Once you are conscious of it it becomes quite annoying.  So bring headphones if you stay to work as I do.  This is my only complaint with this place.  Oh yes, lots of power outlets for your laptop too, that's a plus.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Lady at the cash was really nice but the mac and cheese I got was half cold half boiling hot also probably the worst Mac and cheese I've ever had."}
{"text":"It's a decent central location (right beside Boston Pizza, and right by Square One) if you need to find a spot in Mississauga for a meeting, to meet up with a group, or to basically find a spot with WiFi where you can park yourself to do work and where there are food options available so you won't starve. It's also clean, spacious, with lots of tables, so those are the positives.

However, other than for the purposes I listed above, I wouldn't come here otherwise. For example, I wouldn't come here if my sole purpose was eat a good meal - you will find tastier, better-valued options elsewhere. As well, I'm sure you can find places with WiFi nearby with meals that are better put-together.

I recently came by for a dinner meeting, and we ordered a couple of salads, a sandwich, and soup. Our order came to almost $30.00, and the meal was nowhere close to matching the value we paid. The chicken soup was bland and was basically a bowl of Campbell's broth with noodles and chicken thrown in, the lettuce was wilted and everything we ate was something we could have easily made at home. Quality was definitely not there. 

It's in a convenient location, so come here if you absolutely have to, but if it isn't necessary, I'm sure you can find better options for food + WiFi + meeting space elsewhere nearby."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with their asiago cheese bagel!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing about Panera is that you get to sit for as long as you want, and there's no pressure to get out. This location is always clean, and the staff has always been polite. The prices are what keep me from going to the 5 star mark, but even as I write I recognize that the quality of food is excellent. But...can't bring myself to go for the 5."}
{"text":"Very clean and friendly staff. We stopped by after a long flight to kill some time before we could check into our hotel."}
{"text":"the only Panera Bread I come to in town, such a clean area & enough seats for lunch time when the rush comes in. the food is always great. I have yet to have a bad experience."}
{"text":"Visiting town and looking for a familiar place when I stumbled upon this near my hotel. I was so grateful to find it. Service was excellent. I came in just one step ahead of a giant high school swim team around 4pm. I saw the fear in the employees' eyes when they say them, but the whole team was seated with food in less than 15 minutes!! 

The wifi was very poor though, to be fair, I was sitting in the very back corner. The cleanliness could use some work - dirty tables. At the same time, the *patrons* should be picking up their trash. I saw one woman leave 8 open sugar packets and napkins all over her table! 

Overall, it was a good time and I was grateful to be in a familiar place."}
{"text":"The Pineville Panera has a 93.5 sanitation rating and it is absolutely disgusting. The food, which we normally like, cold and did not taste good. Then I made the mistake of using their restroom which was an absolute pig style. Sadly I saw several employees and people who looked like managers. Will never return to this location and likely not to any Panera for a long time after his experience.."}
{"text":"I went to this location for the first time today to pickup an online order over lunch. The location is nice. There was plenty of parking. The restaurant was clean and the whole pickup system was pretty easy (I just had to walk in and grab it from the cubbies). I wasn't expecting gourmet dining, but for the price and quality, I thought it was pretty good. If you are going to dine-in, there seems to be plenty of seating and the employees are nice."}
{"text":"The service was extremely prompt. I waited for about 5 minutes to receive my food. I unfortunately did not enjoy the salad I ordered. I ordered the southwest Chile lime ranch salad, as they did not have the original southwest caesar salad available. This was a surprise, because although most Paradise Bakeries have been bought out by Panera, they are still able to accommodate their customers with the original southwest Caesar salad. I also had the mac and cheese and this was amazing as always."}
{"text":"As far as Paneras go, this one is a-okay. As with most restaurants it can be hit or miss depending on the day, time and employees when you are there. I find that in the evenings, the \"C-crew\" is usually on duty. That means SLOW service, small portions, and an unwillingness to make the customer happy. On several occasions when I've dined here after 6 pm I've been told that they were \"out\" of different soups, whole grain bread, etc. with no offer to fix something else. Call me crazy but I think a restaurant with \"Bread\" in its name ought to have whole grain and plain baguettes, which come as standard sides with every meal, cooking up fresh. If the kitchen is out, then they need to bake more! What the heck? 

At lunch time the \"A-crew\" is usually working so you get better food and service. This place gets insanely crowded during the lunch rush so get there early if you want a seat and you want to avoid lines. The staff tries hard to keep the tables clean but there are always some jackass businessmen who get there at 9 am, order coffee, and then sit and hog boots or tables made for 4 people all day long. So rude. 

The interior could use a little TLC and renovation; the place is usually pretty clean but the furnishings are falling apart (note the photo I took of one of their chairs with a huge hole it in fixed with tape). 

The salads here are really good and they use good ingredients. I do agree that the portion sizes can be very small, especially if you don't eat bread or carbs. I usually have the cobb salad here since I'm a low-carber. Check out my photo of the salad they actually served me recently -- the chicken portion on top was SO SKIMPY, even by Panera's standards. 

This location has a good selection of fountain sodas (Pepsi brand) and they even have caffeine free Diet Pepsi. Their fresh brewed ice tea is great."}
{"text":"I love Panera Bread so much that I frequent all of the different locations in the Vegas area. This location is the absolute WORST! I went for (most likely) the last time last night. I went in for a takeout salad. The employees were not friendly and looked a bit \"out of it.\" 

The girl who took my order never smiled and seemed to be \"chained\" to the cash register. While she was attempting to take the order of the woman in front of me, a kid came up and asked for a takeout box. Instead of finishing the order, she stops the customer mid-order and walks away to get a takeout box. 

When it's finally my turn to order, I ask for a little extra salad dressing on my chopped chicken cobb with avocado salad. She tried to charge me almost $1 EXTRA for dressing. What? I've never had a Panera attempt this extra upcharge before. I mean, I asked for no eggs on my salad so you'd think they could toss in a spoonful of extra dressing for free. 

As I waited for my order, I kept hearing the kitchen yelling about being out of this and out of that (bread, sauces, etc). Luckily they weren't out of any ingredients in my salad. I grabbed my takeout bag and headed for home. 

Once I started to eat my $10 overpriced takeout salad, I was so disappointed. First, the portion size was super tiny. There was a good amount of chicken but hardly any blue cheese, lettuce or avocado (I'd say the kitchen was attempting to hide the fact that a miniscule amount of avocado was on my salad -- it was about 2 small slices that were chopped into 5 pieces each to make it look like there was more). I eat this salad at least once a week (no joke) and most Panera locations add at least 4 or 5 FULL slices of avocado. 

And as if to sum up this experience, the whole grain baguette portion in the bag was totally burned on the bottom (see photo). 

Panera is a good chain restaurant but this location is horrible. You can do much better than wasting your money here. I hope the corporate office can address some of the problems here. All you have to do is take a look at the Yelp reviews and you'll see the common themes and problems."}
{"text":"I usually don't review chain restaurants but this Hughes Center location of Panera Bread is one of the THE worst managed restaurants I have ever been to. I usually order takeout from this location (I've done so at least a dozen times), and every single time my order is wrong. Every. Single. Time. No, really. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME!!

This location is by my husband's office so sometimes he'll pick up a takeout order that I place through the My Panera app and bring it home (which is a 25 minute drive away). I love Panera, but even I now refuse to order from this disastrous location. I have complained -- repeatedly -- to the manager here (who is obviously incompetent, lazy or both) and corporate and nobody seems to care at all. This has made me have very, VERY negative opinions towards Panera in general. 

I can't even begin to list all of the things that have been wrong with my orders. EACH AND EVERY TIME my salad is missing an ingredient, be it avocado, chicken, bacon, tomatoes or, as was the case with my most recent order, THE WRONG KIND OF LETTUCE. Who makes a mistake like that? I've had the wrong soup put in my bag (since when is broccoli cheddar soup easily mistaken for french onion soup? They don't even LOOK the same)!!! It's the manager's responsibility to double check every order before it goes on the takeout shelf, and he is seriously failing at his job. 

This location is ALWAYS out of something too -- they never have any sides other than potato chips (um, you are called Panera BREAD, that means you should always have bread available as a side). Want one of their delicious sprouted whole grain rolls as a side item? Forget it. They will never be available.

The worst error this place has ever made was when they gave me PEANUT salad dressing instead of the Greek dressing that usually comes on my salad. What if I had a peanut allergy? What if I gave that salad to a child with a peanut allergy? OMG! That could've KILLED somebody!

I called the manager right away to tell him and he was less than concerned. He offered a \"free meal\" but I told him that I live on the other side of town so it's not like I could just hop in the car and come back. Plus, I don't want any free meals from this location. Guys, it's THAT bad!"}
{"text":"Although my favorite salad has not lived up to former standards I still love this franchise.  The Lake Mead store is full of friendly,  super helpful employees.  They always greet us when we walk in. I have been getting coffee here for 2 years and it's always hot and tasty!  This location is close to our place and easily accessible!  It's a great feeling to find a restaurant that feels so homey and comfortable."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to a Panera in a couple of years. It was always a favorite of mine, as franchise restaurants go. I went to Panera many times while living in Chicago. One usually (if you can believe the ad claims) did not have to worry about the freshness or sources of their menu items. And overall, except for all the self-service bumping into others and clumsiness of getting your food to the table, a pretty pleasant all around lunch experience. Good choice of delicious baked goods and creative tasty sandwiches.

The thing I noticed at this location was the \"hybrid\" self-service had been adopted where you order at the counter, and your order is delivered by staff to your table. So that does help a bit with the traffic problem.The biggest problem I had was the quality of the orders. I ordered a Noodle Bowl ($9.00) and my companion ordered a 1/2 panini and cup of soup. My noodle bowl was a sad excuse for a noodle bowl, and definitely not worth the ten bucks or so. My friend's sandwich was almost completely lacking in contents, such as chicken or veggies as advertised. It just looked like they adapted some corporate cost-saving program, or maybe and adaptation of the Greek government's austerity program. But I left with some remaining noodle longing, and full of mostly broth.

I would come back here for the baked goods or maybe to take out some Cheese and Broccoli soup, but not for a sit down meal. I'd rather in this case patronize the other local spots for sandwiches or soup, or Noodle Bowls. Panera just seems like it's no longer a good value."}
{"text":"My coworker utilized the delivery option today and ordered some soup for me. I love the broccoli cheddar soup so much. It's always very good. Also, the delivery order said 45 minutes.... but it was at the door in less than 15 minutes! Amazing!"}
{"text":"If I could give them zero-star I would ......the service is so bad ....the waiting time is so long and they always charge you extra stuff for no reason beware beware."}
{"text":"Managed to get in before the lunch crowd which was good because the place got packed quickly after.
Really fast service, food started arriving at the table before everyone had finished ordering.
Taste was pretty good, everything was fresh well prepared.
Price was just over $10, not bad for lunch.  However, small portion sizes.  If you are hungry skip the pick 2 option and go for 2 different full size choices.  Even the women who usually end up getting some of their meals to go from other outings finished everything.."}
{"text":"The breakfast selections are limited. I had a spinach and cheese soufflé. It had half a bacon strip on the top and mush in the middle. It was terrible. I ordered a cinnamon raisin bagel for backup, that was fine. The orange juice is bolted and not fresh.  I think they need a new menu."}
{"text":"Their roasted turkey and avocado sandwich is one of my favorites. Problem is it's always lacking something. Barely any turkey or barely any avocado etc. The service at this location is also not so great. I've seen one of the women in the kitchen pretty much yelling at her staff. To get a smile out of some of the food runners is impossible. My most recent visit will definitely be my last. It tasted as though my sandwich was put on white bread and not sourdough bread. I had went inside from being outside while dining to request that my sandwich be remade. One of the food runners came outside, picked up my sandwich with her bare hand and came back into the restaurant said she'd be back with my remade sandwich. Several minutes later I received the same exact sandwich with an extra piece of bread attached to it. This is absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews, but this specific Panera takes forever to order if there are customers, the avocado for multiple days has been black and gooey (bad produce at a Panera?!), no one staffs the coffee bar so they pull someone off register to make each coffee drink (slowing everything down more) and the internet is the worst I've ever seen. Even basic Google will just time-out before you can load the page. 

I love Panera. I hope this one can bounce back."}
{"text":"Order placer person nice. Everything else sucked. The greasy floor was especially bad. An old woman would have busted a hip on that oil spill. Order wrong. Stuff not available. First and last time."}
{"text":"A new facility. Food lives up to Panera quality. But CAUTION. DO HAVE A FRESH MAP IN YOUR GPS. TUCKED-away behind a tall building. Keep looking, worth the adventure."}
{"text":"No issues here. Quick service, hot food. Dining area clean and staff pleasant. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Worst Panera I've ever been experienced. They told me I was eligible for any free drink of choice (it was actually $1 off any drink of choice) and when they discovered their mistake it took over 5 minutes for the cashier to figure out how to remove the drink. I watched them slowly assemble my botched turkey avocado BLT over a span of 10 minutes. Meanwhile, I was the only customer at the time. Ridiculous wait times, and bad customer service."}
{"text":"I have come to this location several times, and each time had a great experience. The staff is always pleasant, kind, and helpful. I am able to place my order quickly and it comes out just as fast. I love the Green Goddess Cobb Salad. I do think the portions and prices aren't always compatible, however I still enjoy coming here for fresher and better options. Their menu has great selections for gluten, vegan, and vegetarian needs. I also am part of the Panera Rewards, which definitely comes in handy and has perks if you visit regularly."}
{"text":"My office ordered breakfast for 25, online. It was delivered 5 minutes late, but completely as ordered. The delivery person set it all up on the buffet table. She brought plates, napkins, and cups for the orange juice. The food was lukewarm; fortunately, we have  a microwave to re-heat it. The sausage sandwiches were not nearly as good as when they are fresh in the restaurant. Both the sausage and the egg were exact circles, and quite thin. Tasted okay. Not exciting."}
{"text":"Went there today with friends and they were crowded because of a girls soccer tournament.  They got everyones order done in a timely manner.  Their salads are wonderful.  Best part of our visit today was having Jaye help us - she got us water, salt and was just so nice!  What a sweet young lady and Panera should be glad to have such wonderful employees like Jaye.  This is a great place to get a healthy meal with good service  if you are in the neighborhood.  My friends also love their \"sticky buns\" - sadly not a fan of them but they said they were delicious."}
{"text":"I've only been here one time and I can probably say that will be my only place here as everything is overpriced and their WiFi does not work at all.  I only had a 7 dollar strawberrry smoothie and left soon after as the longer I stayed there, I felt like I was in God's waiting room or his time share cottage.  

The city of Toronto doesn't need more overpriced bakery cafes, we need more yoga studios or Arby's"}
{"text":"Visiting from Dayton twice this month and stopped in for breakfast both times. Noticed restaurant very dirty and restrooms a disgrace.  Will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! Perfect bread, perfect cheese, perfect customer service. Oh and the smoothies taste like love in a cup!!! I was wondering why everyone said this place was good and now I know why. Go here, this place is to live for!!!"}
{"text":"I get lunch from here a few times a week. I really like it, healthy fresh food. Nothing fried, no preservatives .
All the people who work here are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Pathetic. Vegan quinoa bowl. Here's the menu picture, and here's what I received. If I wanted a bowl of spinach, then I would have ordered it.  This was their last chance. MOVE ON FROM THIS ONE"}
{"text":"If I had to study, have a coffee or tea with a friend to talk or get light breakfast, Panera would be my go to spot. 

First, if you have not tried their breakfast soufflés, you are missing out. These flakey, savory breakfast quiches are sitting on a warmer so it comes out warm. The cheese, egg and base are so well put together, it doesn't matter which one you order. They are all amazing.  Salads are good too. 

Next about Panera, they have comfy booths for 2-4 people to sit in. These are good to have good conversation with friends and to study. Some of them have outlets on the wall so you can plug your devices in. I'm also pretty sure they have free wifi."}
{"text":"Great service, fast, and inexpensive. You can order half sandwich with pasta salad or soup. With that, they offer a side of bread, chips, or an apple. The portions are enough for the price. Great for on the go!!"}
{"text":"Panera Bread. The Paradise Bakery of the east.

There is plen-ty of seating at this location. And the staff was very friendly.

Since they are the Paradise of the east, I was already familiar w/ their menu. So, I opted for the Parmesan tortellini and a half of a Fuji apple chicken salad. Our food came out quickly, which is nice cuz I was starving. Ive said it before and Ill say it again, their pasta portions are way too small, but delicious. And I love the Fuji apple salad. The chicken has some great seasoning, theres dried cranberries, walnuts, blue cheese, tomatoes, and apple chips on it. W/ some fruity vinaigrette, its the perfect combination.

And apparently on the east coast, they sub out the free cookie w/ some free bread.

Id definitely recommend this place over the hotel its attached to."}
{"text":"Came in here and ordered catering for 12 people. Called in a day ahead and was told it would take about 15-20 minutes. When I got here and ordered, it became 30-45 minutes. Over an hour later still sitting and waiting. Staff was friendly, but will not order from here again."}
{"text":"Good luck getting them to answer the phone to place an order. When you call there is not an option to place a pick up order. You can speak to a manager , place a catering order or connect to the bakery. Tried all 3 for 15 minutes and phone will just ring and ring and go to a busy signal. Wish I had a business that I could just throw business away because I was too busy. This location is a hot mess"}
{"text":"This isn't against this particular Panera bread, this is a 1 star review in regards to the brand.  It's amazing to me how this place still exists and it's amazing that I went against my word to come here again.  You go to Panera bread and order a 7 dollar sandwich that literally looks like a middle schoolers turkey sandwich that's stuck in a plastic lunch box all day and a 5 dollar CUP of soup that comes in the ugliest plastic little cup that looks like the same soup served at the local soup kitchen.  The most over priced low quality crap on earth they serve at Panera bread.  Their are so many other \"fast food\" places that have way better quality for less money.  If you go to Panera Bread.  Start saving your money and get better value elsewhere."}
{"text":"This location is hoppin' in the mornings - especially on a Saturday with a convention in town and plenty of locals.  On our most recent trip to Monroeville, my husband wanted some kind of pastry/bread for his morning breakfast, so I suggested we hit up Panera.  (There wasn't much else in the area according to Yelp - so that was that).

Actually, I was quite happy with my breakfast quiche.  Hubby ended up with a breakfast sandwich and I ate the pastry.  Either I was starving or the food was really good.  Since I'm definitely not starving, I think it's fair to say our choices were tasty. 

Despite the crowds, the line went quickly.  They had plenty of people manning the cash registers, and the wait wasn't long at all!"}
{"text":"Love this Panera location. Clean, welcoming, great service and staff!  Always great food."}
{"text":"I made my first visit here. Inside the store is cool, and there are machines that are ordered separately. Employees deliver food directly. It seems kind of nice. Food is delicious and recommended."}
{"text":"It's Panera.  They're the same everywhere.  They've spent millions on figuring out what we want, so they've basically figured it out.  It's pretty good, pretty cheap...  You know, I wish some local would come up with something better but what can I say?  I'm not going to force-feed myself crap just because I won't support some corp.  What can ya do?  It's good stuff..."}
{"text":"Very nice example of how a chain restaurant SHOULD be. Wonderful building and atmosphere, different than all the \"greasy spoon\" joints in lakewood.

Fresh and different breakfast food as well.

The only improvement would be a price cut. I wouldn't go here to buy bread (blackbird or breadsmith on the west end), but for a quick breakfast or sandwich for lunch, it's great!"}
{"text":"Based on our experience today. Our food was served on soiled dishes. The bagel was rather odd shape and ugly. My wife's carrot cake muffin was very dry. Tasted stale. Panera Bread has been subject to inconsistency. This branch is normally one of the better ones but not today. In talking to an assistant manager, they have difficulty getting the dark stains out so deliberately serve food on soiled dishes. Our dishes at home do not have dark stains. Other restaurants do not have this problem."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with Panera last night. I ordered a strawberry poppyseed salad, full size, to go. We also ordered a chicken tortellini, a lg drink and 2 pecan braids. I eat this salad probably at least 2-3 times a week, I was so frustrated with this store. I got home and the lettuce in my salad was very limp and a lot of it was brown. It tasted terrible. I called and spoke to a manager, she told me to bring it back and they would give me a new one. I drove back down there, gave back my salad in exchange for a new one. I was very pleasant at all times. Got back home to find that the salad was worse this time. Called back down there and the manager told me, she had checked the lettuce and it looked fine to her, so they did not give me better lettuce, they used the same batch. I ended up throwing the entire second salad away. I sure would not have wasted my time, gas, and money on a 2nd trip for another horrible tasting salad. I am very displeased with the customer service and quality of the food, probably for the first time since I started going there 2-3 years ago."}
{"text":"We brought our kids here for breakfast, and at 10:37 they refused to sell us breakfast sandwiches. We were planning to buy a dozen bagels to take with us, but we are happy to spend our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wilted salad alert. I ordered the arugula with chicken and it looked like the leaves were wet and frozen. I can only surmise that they don't give a shit, although they apologized profusely."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad. The trash cans were over flowing. Trash was everywhere. And my chicken Alfredo tortellini didn't even have chicken in it."}
{"text":"Went to check out this panera, was my first time at this location. Food was delicious, friendly staff and a clean restaurant. Liked how they had tons of seating outside to enjoy the weather!"}
{"text":"After hearing about the take over coming from Panera I was upset with all of the changes especially how Panera's allows salads to be made without gloves. I was very impressed that after speaking with the owner how he took it upon himself to force his employees to wear gloves. Very appreciated!"}
{"text":"Today I placed an order online, for some reason it just canceled! But I didn't get a notification. I have been calling for the past 15 minutes and it just rings and rings.....and then it just hangs up! Not cool...."}
{"text":"Updated review: 
Had this location recently and they have tremendously improved. French onion soup as well as broccoli and cheddar were both great. Turkey bacon bravo was excellent. Lines moved quickly and pastries were delicious as usual. Only area of concern is that the men's bathroom could use a bit more attention or possibly an upgrade."}
{"text":"Only registers open were in front of breakfast menu. Makes it confusing when they tell you breakfast is over, so you have to walk to the other part of the counter to see the lunch menu. Then walk back over to the breakfast counter to order. 
Also horribly expensive. 
Service was slow. Counter help didn't smile or seem to care about their job. For the price of a sit down breakfast it should be better service/food."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place since it's quiet enough to spend your evening or have a business meeting. Haven't noticed any teenagers there and I believe that's a good enough reason to go. Food is fresh and bakery is good. I also like the idea that they used a transmitter, which allows them to bring food to ur table. Panera was smart to do that bc it avoid unnecessary lines. Prices are fair enough. They also have drive thru for busy people but I'm not sure how fast it takes to get your order there."}
{"text":"Wow, I really wish I had checked Yelp before visiting this location. Then I could understand why there's only 2 stars. This is honestly my first time ever eating at a Panera Bread. This location used to be a Paradise Bakery and then recently changed this year I believe. So I thought I'd give it a try today.

I visited about 4:15p and it wasn't busy at all. A few people sitting and eating and a family not sure what they wanted to order. I went up to the cashier and inquired about what was on a particular sandwich and she seemed bothered that I asked her and didn't even know what was on it until she looked it up. She didn't seem like she wanted to be there, and it was a rather poor customer service experience. I don't really care that much about customer service as long as they're not being rude to me. So I ordered a half sandwich of Turkey-Apple-Cheddar and a cup of soup. I don't try to make my order complicated or ask for anything special about it. I ordered it exactly as it comes.

I was the ONLY person on the order preparation screen and my order came up rather quickly, which I thought was nice. I grabbed my order and and took it home. However, once I finally opened the bag and looked inside, I saw a rather pathetic looking half sandwich. Which honestly I think was over priced. I think it was almost $7 just for a half sandwich. Anyway, that didn't bother me too much as long as the food was good.

Well, it was mediocre tasting when I started eating it, but then I noticed something just wasn't right about it. No turkey! How do you forgot the most crucial and expensive part of the sandwich?!

I could maybe understand if I had tried to customize my sandwich in some way OR if maybe they were busy making other orders and mixed mine up. This was not the case though. This was a very poor experience with Panera Bread for me. Some of you out there may like Panera Bread, I personally prefer Wildflower, but do not visit this location if you do. This will be my first AND last time at a Panera Bread.

I blame myself for not checking the Yelp reviews prior to visiting this location. I won't make that mistake again."}
{"text":"Staff clueless. Friend ordered, then after stepping to side for me to order kitchen yells they are out of that bread. I ordered. We sat to wait on to go orders. My coaster goes off and I go up. They \"cleared\" my order, but did not have ready. They told me to \"sit down and wait\", that was rude. Could have said would you please or give us a minute. Glad my local Panera does not act like this!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here early Saturday morning. Story was empty and there were no lines. I age always liked the concept at Panera/Paradise bakery, large selection of food items are available, and definitely enjoy the light roast coffee they have. For this trip I got a light roast coffee, and a ham, egg and cheese sandwich that was delicious. It was and as always the only negative I have to say about Panera is that the food portion, is not worth the price we pay as all their items are expensive."}
{"text":"Probably the worst ordering process I have ever seen.  You have 5 employees standing their looking at you with half the iPads not working, waiting to take a bag from the back to the front.  Compounded with a $13 sandwich that tastes bad, I can think of a worse place to eat.  Panera, will be the next Chipotle.  I still can't figure out what their value prop is in the market.  Go Jersey Mike's!"}
{"text":"The service is excellent. The staff is friendly and accommodating. On this evening I came in for a late supper before a meeting. I chose to have the French Onion Soup and steak and bleu half a salad. The soup was wonderful. Full of flavor and not skimpy at all on the onions. More cheese would have been great, but that's okay. That's salad was okay. The steak was sparse and kind of fatty, but the dressing was nice as was the chunks of bleu cheese. As always the coffee is good. I like this location head and shoulders above the others in the valley. I guess that's why I keep coming back here."}
{"text":"I stopped in on Saturday for lunch with both of my daughters.  I've been to this location in the past and it's fine.  Food is, basic Panera.  Nothing noteworthy to say other than the food is consistent throughout the country.

This location seems to be a bit mismanaged though.  Saturday right before lunch so we walked in at 11:45 and it was just dirty.  The outside area was not swept, and the tables weren't clean.  Grimy would be a good description of the tables.  There was plenty of staff and not one of them were cleaning.  Not sure where the Manager was, but obviously they weren't walking around the place to see what needed to be done.

If you have time, go to Rock Hill off Dave Lyle instead."}
{"text":"Great option when you're craving soups and sandwiches. Delicious bakery items too! I usually dine here or Rachel's Kitchen, both are convenient and fast options at The District. 

Recently ordered Thai Wonton broth - dish is ok. Very salty. If it wasn't salty, it'd be great ~"}
{"text":"Was thrilled to have a Panera location nearby! However, I think that for the price we are paying, it's a very small amount of food."}
{"text":"Since I was going to visit a client in the area this Panera cafe was a good choice for Bfast. The cafe has free Wi Fi, clean, comfy and I love the dark roast coffee here.

My order the power bfast sandwich - smoked ham, egg, Vermont cheddar cheese on whole grain bread, OJ and coffee.

Free refills on coffee and the Wi Fi will keep me returning here for sure!"}
{"text":"I wish they had kept the same menu and quality of food as Paradise Bakery.  I've  been to more than once location and they are all bad. Breakfast was more like Macdonalds.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was so excited to learn Fort Mill was getting a Panera, and one with a drive thru.  My first two visits were after 8 pm, 1-2 weeks after they opened, both through the drive thru, both involving salad orders.  Both times I was the only person in line - both times I could see at least 6-8 young people in the kitchen.  Unfortunately, they spent more time talking to one another than working - both orders were a lengthy wait.  I finally went in on my 3rd visit two weeks ago.  It was after 2 pm, and it was mostly empty, with only one couple ahead of me in line.  While I waited for my food (soup and salad - 13 minutes), I was horrified to see how dirty the dining room was, even though there was plenty of staff and few customers.  I had to bus a dirty table and wipe off my chair to get a seat.  Empty tables around me still had plates and food debris.  There was food under the tables and in the aisle.  Finally a manager came and took the dishes away from two of the empty tables.  Five minutes later, two young women came out - apparently sent to clean.  They cleaned the larger tabletop, but none of the smaller tables or the floor.  Before I left the restaurant, I asked to see the manager to suggest he have someone check the dining room.  The restaurant is constructed in a somewhat odd layout - it is not possible to see the DR from behind the counter.    I held off on reviewing thinking this might be a one-off situation, but after reading the other reviews, that does not appear to be the case.  I think the issue here is that the very young staff just needs closer supervision.    I would suggest scheduling an employee in the DR or at least walking through every 15 minutes or so, especially when it is slow."}
{"text":"Twice I've ordered the bowl ($8.99) of Mac and Cheese and both times the container was half-full. So a cup of Mac and Cheese is almost $10. I've never had an issue with food quality or any notable horrible service. The drive-thru takes a while sometimes."}
{"text":"Previously Paradise Bakery I love this place all the employees know my name and order by heart they always greet me when I walk in the door, my only complaint is that now that they are Panera they have changed their hours to open later for breakfast which I was not too happy about since I usually get off work early & go straight there but now I have to wait an hour :/ other than that, amazing menu and amazing customer service you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Had the soup and sandwich with a Green tea to wash it all down!

The soup was the Broccoli Cheese which the broccoli was pureed like baby food, and the sandwich was the roasted turkey with bacon and avocado and I didn't realize it at the time but it comes on a ciabatta bread, if you want something else you gotta ask for it."}
{"text":"I am a fan. I stop frequently when in the neighborhood as I like their local and organic produce that they use for their food. Another thing that I like is the coffee refills and reliable wifi.
Their food is creative, diverse and evolving menu, especially their seasonal specials. I love earning the every day free bagel on your birthday month, their discounts for pick 2, bagels, free cup of coffee, or breakfast pastries.
I signed up for the mypanera rewards program early on and it does pay off. I love their online app and fast rapid pick up.
Another nice thing is the mini-scan card on my key ring."}
{"text":"One of my old time favorites - healthy food choices, fast service and I like the rapid pick up when you order from your phone. My go to place when I don't want to cook and have an healthy option for dinner.
The only trouble I have experience is that sometime the app on the phone does not work properly.
Be sure to become a member to you a lot of perk throughout the year"}
{"text":"Panera as a chain as come a really long way, focusing on local and organic produce, I love stopping at either one of their locations in Madison when I am not in the mood to cook and want a healthy choice for a meal.
This location, while definitely not too far from my place it is quite out of the way and therefore I usually do not stop here that much, but definitely good to know this location as well."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, so it's time for an update. Panera is a great place to get to when you want to drink coffee (free refills!) while you suck down some internet and maybe try to get some work done. Quite a lot of tables, many of which do have a power outlet nearby.

The \"pick two\" is the best way to get a variety of flavors and textures for your meal. Choice of a smaller salad, a reasonable bowl of soup and a half of one of their signature sandwiches. But for breakfast, I prefer the toasted everything bagel (you may want to ask them to put it through twice) with cream cheese is a good meal. Especially since the coffee is refillable.

During the busy lunch times (11 to 1), the wifi will cut out after a half hour. This is your cue to start tethering your phone. Though if the place is filling up, it's not polite to take up a table and not be eating. Give folks a chance. There are also a couple tables outside in the sun that still reach the wifi (but no power).

The kiosk ordering system is great. Skip the line and you can still get your order in and pay. Panera now accepts NFC payments as well from your phone!

Tip: If someone is taking up an entire four seat table by themselves and there is no other space, you're perfectly okay to ask if you can share."}
{"text":"I had never been to Panera Bread until I got a gift card for my birthday.  I've heard its good from several people.  I just don't get it though. I got a turkey and avocado BLT sandwich on sour dough.  It was a fine sandwich but nothing spectacular.  For $9.00 I would have expected more.  And what was with the choice of sides?  An apple, a bag of chips, or a piece of bread.  A piece of Bread?  Really?  What on earth would I want a piece of bread as a side for when  I am eating a sandwich?  It seems redundant to me.  And an apple just isn't my thing.  So a bag of chips it was.  Kettle cooked I believe.  Again, fine but not spectacular.  They're just chips.  There is nothing especially wrong with Panera. It just isn't a place for me."}
{"text":"So a Panera is a Panera, I guess... in general they range for me, averaging somewhere around a 4-star, I mean they are a chain but I tend to crave some of their soups and sandwiches... and they have free wireless... which should be standard now-a-days but isn't.

This location was just okay because my soup was only luke warm and did not come with any bread. I'm pretty sure a bowl of soup comes with bread; if it doesn't it should.  What am I supposed to dip into my soup? Since it was only luke warm and all I had was an apple I turned my broccoli cheddar soup into fondue.

Meh, I'll search for a local place next time."}
{"text":"It's bread, scones, pastries!!! You know it's awesome. That should be all I need to say. 

But they have yummy soups and salads, too! (I love their lentil-kale soup) I read recently Panera has eliminated all additives, preservatives and food enhancers in their foods, too. Bonus! Service at the District Panera is great, too. They are always friendly and well organized.

We go there on Fridays a couple times a month for their clam chowder and warm bread."}
{"text":"As someone who used to work at this location just under three years ago it pains me to say how poorly our food was prepared. We ordered a half green goddess salad and a whole Asian sesame salad on May 11th, 2018, and once delivered to our home we were extremely upset to see the asian sesame salad was missing half its ingredients and was a very small portioned. My green goddess Cobb with chicken was something I always look forward to and it was missing ingredients and was very small as well. Not to mention our baguette was poorly ripped it looked like a dog got a hold of it before delivered. For 30$ this was not worth it. 

However the woman delivering it was very kind."}
{"text":"Panera Bread has taken off the Chipotle Chicken Panini off the menu, if you want it back as bad as I do, sign my petition by quickly clicking this link http://www.thepetitionsite.com/503/274/237/panera-bread-please-bring-back-the-chicken-chipotle-panini./"}
{"text":"Been here twice, Actually first time ever trying Pamela was at this location a few weeks ago. It's really good. Customer service is great and I've never stood in a line that would hold me up on my lunch break. I'm indecisive and haven't explored the menu yet, but the workers there have been completely nice and patient with me which is a plus. They have really good deals i have got the salad and soup as a pick two and today i tried their turkey bacon avocado with the salad. I've only tried the fuji salad. Omg it's freaking AMAZING! It comes with ( i forgot what kind of cheese ) but i usually wouldn't eat that cheese but on this salad it was soooooo good!!! I always get that extra Fuji sauce. I jut had it a few hours ago and I'm already craving it. It's a nice place to sit relax and catch up on work as well. Not too loud. Not too crowded. It was perfect. Can't wait to explore the rest of the menu. Because YES!!! I will be back (:"}
{"text":"So far this location moves pretty slow. There needs to be more consistency in flow and maybe next time buying a dozen cookies won't take 30 minutes. It just seems that everyone is all over the place.
I look forward to a better experience."}
{"text":"I love their Cesar salad and the broccoli soup ! Just their customer service sucks. I order online rapid pick up and the employee who handed me my order did not give me my drink which I did pay for ,I asked her for it and she gave rolled her eyes at me . I don't know why she would get upset it's not like I'm not paying for my food"}
{"text":"I'm always respectful to the staff but I often get attitude from roughly 90% of the employees.
I hardly, if ever, have a negative experience at the Willoughby location, though."}
{"text":"tuna sandwich runny and tuna was used \"sparingly\" on my 1/2 sandwich. My clam chowder was cold and I returned it to be warmed.  I'm not sure I'd call it clam chowder, it was more like burnt milk with a couple of potato cubes in it.  All out of plain ice tea.  I don't drink that fruity stuff.  But noticed that people who did try to get some, half of the containers were empty as well.  Definitely picked the wrong day to go, and wrong section to sit in....  nothing but whinny fussy kids that parents didn't seem to realize needed to be removed from the place."}
{"text":"The food is good. The service ok.  Cleanliness awful.  This was the cleanest table I could find.  Crumbs everywhere."}
{"text":"The service here gets worse and worse. I waited 12 minutes for a half saladduring off peak hours. The half salad and drink i got totaled around ten dollars. I could have gotten the same from Cheesecake factory and a giant salad to feed two people instead of a snack salad with too little portions."}
{"text":"An incredible lunch spot! The smell draws you in. I've been coming to Pantera for years. I think I've been to almost all of the Vegas locations.  I've never had a horrible experience or bad service at this location. They are fast and keep the place clean. 

My lunch of choice is the Pick Two. I go with the broccoli cheese soup and the half sandwich. My favorite sandwich is the Turkey Bacon Avocado. You also get your choice of bread or an apple. Being a carb addict,  I always choose the bread. Yeah, yeah I know it's not good for me. I also enjoy the flavored teas they offer. I feel slightly healthier drinking the tea even though I have no idea what's in it. 

This is a great place to enjoy some lunch as I often do with some coworkers."}
{"text":"Wow this place is busy, but the staff does a great job handling the mob.  The food quality is top notch and is easily one of the best Panera Bread locations in Vegas.  This place is so consistently good that I will branch out of my usual items and try different dishes.

My wintertime favorite is the pick 2 combo.  Get half a sandwich and a cup of hot soup for a price that's so low you'll think they forgot to charge you for something.  I recommend any Panini to pair with the tomato bisk and select the bread side option.  Start by dipping the bread in the soup, then get nuts and dip the Panini in the soup.  Crazy good!

My favorite sandwich is the Turkey Bravo, everything on that sandwich is incredible.  My favorite part is the bread they use for this sandwich, which is a dope tomato basil!  You'll want to get the whole sandwich and not the half when dealing with the Turkey Bravo, you were warned."}
{"text":"The food is always very good at Paradise Bakery but at this location they are very slow at the register. I would hate to be on a time crunch when I go in there. They seem to get a big lunch crowd, there was no parking."}
{"text":"The Turkey Bacon Bravo sandwich is great when you want something light.  Full of flavor but won't leave you feeling sluggish, I love the tomato basil bread, it's got a sweetness to it that's unique.  This Panera is a long row house of a store.  The service here is always fast and the people are nice."}
{"text":"Rude customer service. The cashier acted as if we were inconveniencing her. And got an attitude when she gave me my food and I told her it was to go. She should have asked when I placed my order. I blame these types of attitudes on management. Why would you allow workers to act like this? Clearly from the reviews on here this is a problem at this location. Stop hiring people that are not friendly and that give bad customer service. Or better yet, teach them how to do this and expect nothing less."}
{"text":"Very delicious lunch option! Love the bagels and the frozen lemonades! Plenty of seating and parking. Slightly confusing check out. Drinks are at a different counter"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Panera, and this restaurant meets my expectations. I particularly love the Asiago Cheese Bagel, Caesar Salad, Bacon Turkey Bravo Sandwich, Tuna Salad Sandwich, Smokehouse Turkey Panini, Broccoli Cheddar Soup, and Iced Chai Tea Latte. I've ordered all of these items at this location, and they have been very tasty.

I have had this location run out of the side of French Baguette once or twice. However, last time that occurred, I asked for a bread bowl as a replacement, which I was given for free.

I'll definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped at this Panera while traveling between Pittsburgh and Hilton Head a few months ago. The pros were the ability to order via iPads (in addition to a couple cashiers) and the great outdoor seating (especially on a gorgeous day). The con was an awkwardly placed soda machine that created a bit of a bottle neck and the super packed parking lot. We had a tasty, typical Panera meal. However, I likely won't be stopping at this exit again. The parking lot and traffic in the area were hectic enough that it slowed us down a lot more than we expected."}
{"text":"This West Mifflin Panera is one of the better restaurants in the area (definitely better than the mall's dismal options or the Chinese buffet in the same plaza). I've dined here and gotten take-out multiple times when we lived in the South Hills several years ago and now again that I work from this area occasionally. It's never disappointed and the service has always been prompt. I'll likely be back."}
{"text":"I dropped by this location Monday morning last week while on my way to the airport. The dining area itself was pretty empty other than several people dining together and talking loudly about their plans for the day. I ordered a simple bagel, cream cheese, and iced latte. The bagel was delicious as always - gotta love Panera bagels - and the latte was also good, even by my pickier coffee standards. However, the girl serving me wasn't the most warm or enthusiastic individual... she needed a little more pep in her step. Overall-- good food but just OK customer service and dining experience."}
{"text":"For some reason, every time that I go to this Panera, something annoys me! I am quite the Panera lover, too, and this is the only restaurant of probably 20-30 locations that I have been to that has consistently not met my expectations. 

The annoyance starts as I walk into the door. I stand behind the roped off line every time I'm there trying to decide what I want. However, this is the only location where I'm asked 5 times while standing there if I need help. I'm sorry, but I understand how a line works and will make my way into the line when I'm done staring at the menu! 

In the past, I had a simple bagel and cream cheese order confused. More recently, I've been disappointed by some part of my meal every time I'm there. The last two times that I've been to this restaurant, my issue was the french baguette. Their baguettes are cut very inconsistently and are often very thin and flat. The You Pick 2 sandwiches are also unusually tiny.

The best part of the restaurant is how huge it is! It's at least twice as large as a normal Panera and looks like it's a popular spot for college students to study and take a break."}
{"text":"This Panera has become one of my favorites in the city and my new Sunday lunch destination after the Boulevard of the Allies location disappointed me one too many times. Generally, Paneras are pretty similar -- food is good, delivery is fast, and service is adequate. I believe that the food, delivery, and service at this Panera are what I would come to expect from the chain. 

What I really appreciate about this location is the very large dining room. Instead of feeling that I'm practically sitting on top of someone, this location allows patrons to spread out and have more privacy. Plus, this is a nice little plaza! After filling our bellies with Bacon Turkey Bravos, Caesar Salads, or Broccoli Cheese soup, my husband and I split up, with him heading over to Coffee Tree Roasters and with me to Anthropologie. Everyone is happy!"}
{"text":"This is your average Panera location... average customer service and average food and average wait. However, I like Panera a lot, so I really can't fault a Panera for being average. The location is conveniently located right off the west portion of William Penn Hwy. It's the perfect place to stop if you're sick and had to go to the MedExpress next door. Panera certainly knows how to serve up tasty comfort food!"}
{"text":"My family loves their bagels but take it to go! The tables are always dirty, employees joking around that don't care about customer service AT ALL. Paradise Bakery was so much better in every way. The Managers don't seem to care about the customers either since we witnessed a gentleman complain about their order, she didn't even apologize and seemed put out. Train your cashiers to be polite and not annoyed."}
{"text":"We went through the drive through and were served by Joe.  Nothing but 5 stars for his customer service and the food is 5 star as well.  Very tasty and fresh.  They don't make sales here they build customers."}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru and ordered a whole Italian sandwich.    I always order the sandwich and it is always meaty spicy and delicious with lots of flavors.  This time around they duped me in the drive thru.  This sandwich is supposed to come with smoked lean ham, Chianti wine salami, spicy sopressa, provolone spicy giardiniera, basil Mayo and fresh arugula.  What I got was so disappointing I may never come back again.  At first glance the sandwich looks like bread and lettuce.  I only got one slice of meat and one slice of cheese and wilty gross lettuce. There was no basil mayo, and a couple of chunks of the giardiniera. The sandwich is supposed to be three meats cheese and ARUGULA.  DO THE SANDWICH MAKERS IN THE BACK NOT HAVE LIST OF INGREDIENTS THAT NEED TO GO ON A SANDWICH?  Paid over $9 for this.  SO VERY DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"Nice place for breakfast or brunch. Great atmosphere friendly staff.
Self serve coffee is a big turn off for me. I would expect coffee to be served at a breakfast place."}
{"text":"Good Food, Good Service, Fresh, not to unique, a bit pricey for some items."}
{"text":"I usually come in for lunch and get their salads, but decided to try their breakfast today. I got the turkey sausage,egg sandwich and added avocado. It was the saddest, ugliest sandwich I have ever gotten(see photos). First of all, that amount of avocado is NOT worth the extra charge of adding it on. I couldn't not even taste it.  Disappointed. And why on earth is there a giant lump of turkey sausage in one area, and the rest of the egg white has nothing?? 
I am hesitant to come again because this was a waste of my time."}
{"text":"I went to this location for the first time and was glad to see they had drive through. I ordered the summer corn chowder and salad but when I got home very disappointed that they had given me Clam chowder. A waste of $4 since I don't like clam chowder. It would be great if they would confirm the order either as I'm ordering it or at the window. Instead, she told me the total, asked if I needed a receipt, and handed me my food. 

The food is okay but indeed small portions. One of the few places that offers easy to order, lite and somewhat healthy foods."}
{"text":"food quality is good. serving size is small. price is very high. bathrooms are filthy and cold.   poor value!"}
{"text":"I just tried to give zero stars but Yelp has yet to add that feature. This new Panera is very clean and pretty but that is where the pleasantries end because the manager is rude and condescending. I was with a group who placed a large order (over $100) for delivery and there was a payment issue. We tried calling 4 times and nobody picked up. Finally we knew we had to drive there or we would go without any lunch. 

Upon our arrival we were greeted with negativity and disrespect. The manager let us know because of the payment issue we would have to cancel the entire order and re-enter it online. There was no option to re-order in store or offer them an alternative payment method. I quote the manager directly, \"I don't know what to tell you, I have to get back to the kitchen.\"

Back to the kitchen? To what? Ruin more people's business lunches? After 45 minutes, we finally walked out with food. 

But in true Panera fashion, upon getting back to the office it was discovered that they forget a sandwich, 2 chips, and 4 french baguettes. What else did I expect? This Panera has let me down time and time again but I chose to give them the benefit of thinking they'd at least remember to give me a piece of bread. They should re-name this location to Panera \"you are lucky if you get any\" Bread.

Some things never change, but where I am going to for lunch from now on will."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this Panera... Customer service is awful...Employees almost seem depressed..Food is subpar for what we pay...One particular item is the pasta..clearly they stuck it in the microwave...PANERA this location does NOT represent you well."}
{"text":"This is my fourth visit to this location and I remain disappointed. Due to its convenient location and my love for their bagels, I continue to return hoping that the new facility kinks will be worked out. As of yet, flaws remain evident. 

Three of my visits were on week days around 8:15am and only 1-2 other tables were occupied. I ordered at the kiosk not because of long lines but out of habit. I ordered a toasted bagel with butter and a coffee. The self serve coffee is always hot and the bar tidy. Today I opted to overlook that ALL of the coffee was brewed at 6am when I poured mine at 8:17am. I'm suspecting that their coffee business is not booming since a new Starbucks sits next door, but I believe keeping fresh coffee would be a no brainer. 

After waiting for my bagel to be delivered, I went to the pick up window and saw several staff in the back area preparing what appeared to be a large catering order. Since nobody acknowledged me and could not hear me over loud equipment, I went to the front counter for assistance. I was finally able to get the attention of the sole cashier who had his back to the cash register while he organized pastries. After I explained my situation, he let me know that the kitchen was probably toasting my bagel.  After he made no attempt at customer service, I returned to the pick up window.  Seven (7!) staff members were still busy preparing food for what I assumed was a corporate order since I was at this time the only customer in the establishment! Finally, a young man stepped forward to assist me. I explained that I had waited over 8 minutes for a toasted bagel. We both noted that I was the only name on their order log (computer screen in pick up window) and indeed I had waited now 9+ minutes. Without complaining, he quickly started and completed my order within 2 minutes. 

I know this location is relatively new, but I believe that a month should be plenty of time to get kinks worked out. Unless staffing/training issues are addressed, I fear that the business may not thrive despite its prime location. I believe that management needs to step in and step up to help this fledgling establishment before it fails."}
{"text":"MMmmmm, their soups are DELISH!!! The brocolli cheddar soup is good enough to pop up in my dreams, lol. The pastries are also good. I like their mini loaf cakes and the cheese pastry. They are the only ones I know that sell bear claws in Toronto. If you know of others, please message me!"}
{"text":"I tried this Panera once and it wasn't the same as other Paneras I had been to.  Usually Paneras are very clean and this one looked like they were in a shift change.  I was so hungry I had to order that veggie sandwich but was scared to eat it because everything seemed chaotic.  The staff was OK but didn't seem very happy so the whole experience here was actually depressing.  I love other Paneras and will continue to frequent those but not this particular store.  Sorry!!!"}
{"text":"I frequent this location and the one at Boca Park often.  After visiting both within the past couple of days I realized that I prefer this location over the other.  The crew Is the main reason for that. They are awesome!!!!! I like how they are genuinely nice and attentive =)  Cashiers are helpful & personable, food is fresh & served up quickly and the location is clean - the girls were constantly clearing dishes and wiping up tables."}
{"text":"I come to Panera often for lunch. I either go to this location or to the one on Lake Mead. One of their salads and a tropical hibiscus Ice tea is what I usually order. The bakery Is also pretty good with a nice selection to choose from. The store is clean, food is served up quickly, ingredients are fresh and most of the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Haven't been here since Paradise Bakery name left. Now I know why! Almost $7.00 for half of a sandwich with disgusting brown lettuce and maybe 1/4 cup chicken salad. I won't ever go back for that poor quality and too much money."}
{"text":"Every time I go here it's worse and worse !!! No one on staff seems to even try ! They all stand around with no expression and botch up orders left and right ! Should I have to wait fifteen minutes for a lousy sandwich ?? When it's dead nor even busy . Seriously get your staff on board train or something . I'm done I will not be back !"}
{"text":"We love Panera for their many healthy food options.  However, this location needs some managerial help.  The last three visits were all the same.  Nobody in line but it took 10 minutes to get food.  Most of the tables were dirty, and the floor littered in food.  We hope to see improvements."}
{"text":"I love this place...one of my favorite lunch places. Tuna sandwitch and brocclie chedder soup."}
{"text":"Do not go to this Panera Bread, the service is absolutely ridiculous. Every single time I go there my order is messed up. Today they gave me two different sandwiches and still did not get it correct. Don't waste your money and save yourself a headache, they should be out of business. The last time my order was messed up I called and was lied to by an employee who told me they were a manager. He then continued to call me vulgar names, the GM didn't seem to care about this."}
{"text":"Just about what you'd expect from a Panera. It's always totally packed because it's right across from a busy mall, but they always seem to have enough seating when I go there. The staff always seems slightly overwhelmed, though, and could probably use some help. I wasn't even there at a peak meal time and the lines were long! The cashier was pleasant to me and made good small talk, but was clearly overwhelmed by her line. She also burned my bagel :("}
{"text":"Not sure why these bad reviews below, might just have been a bad experience but mine are usually very positive. Had the watermelon and feta cheese salad with chicken added, very nice, fast and great service."}
{"text":"So for Mother's Day instead of slaving all day to make a home cooked meal, our all female house hold decided to get Panera delivered for our lunch this afternoon. We acquired a few issues with our experience our delivery was almost 30 minutes early.(Which is normally not a bad thing, but when no one is home to pick up the delivery it makes a difference) but originally delivered the wrong order, returned later with the correct order.
 But in the middle of our meal my aunt bit into her sandwich to find a metal shard in her sandwich. This is very displeasing especially to find it in a Panera sandwich where everybody is suppose to be made fresh and by hand ...."}
{"text":"I had an emergency mission come down from the CEO at 4:15 PM on a Thursday:  food and beverages for 80 people, delivered, Friday at 7:30 AM.  Sounds impossible, right?  Not for Kathy and the folks at this Panera location!  Great price, on-time delivery, and Kathy even called me at 7:40 AM on Friday to let me know everything had been wrapped up.  They will be my new \"go-to\" place for catering going forward.   What a great experience!"}
{"text":"Love Panera Bread! Customer service here is great! The staff are attentive and take care of their customers. Plus it's the healthiest place to eat on Rainbow.. subway is 2nd.. haha"}
{"text":"Typically I refrain from writing reviews however I feel as though I needed to write one about my experience this evening. I went to order my food and I wanted a pick two. When I asked for soup in a bread bowl, the girl told me that they were out of bread bowls which okay I understand they are made fresh so fine. I just ask for a cup of soup and a salad. It took over ten mins for me to even get my food and there were not many customers in the place at this time. I go up to grab my food and take it back to my table. I start to eat my salad and the lettuce was just the worst I've ever had. It definitely was not fresh and it tasted more like herbs than lettuce. I didn't complain at the time I just decided to eat it because maybe thats how it was supposed to be. I have seen people eat salads from there and this was my first time ever ordering one so I thought maybe it was me. I finished my food and went into the restroom to wash my hands. It absolutely wreaked of urine. I went into the stall and I'm relatively certain that there was urine on the floor. I just hurried up washed my hands and left. I'm not saying I'll never go to panera again but I'm definitely saying I will not be going back to this one."}
{"text":"Really like it here! I love the counter where  you place your order. It's very open, and you are not all crammed in with other people. Theresa took our order, and she was super friendly and outgoing."}
{"text":"Went in for 2 salads there were no other customers except us. I ordered the green goddess and Thai salad and 2 sprouted grain rolls.  There were 3 employees laughing and joking acting silly and not doing their job. The girl who was making the salads stopped in the midst of making them stated I will be back, a young guy came over with no gloves on from the window, he puts our bread in a bag with no gloves I said I don't want those he said \" my hands are clean\" I'm thinking really so I went to the manager to let her know this and she said she would wash her hands and get gloves which she did.  We arrived home and found the Thai only had tortilla chips and lettuce the girl did not complete the order!!!!!  The goodness salad had limp lettuce and barely any chicken. What a bunch of lazy shiftless ppl those 3 were, had I been the manager-out the door they would go!!!! I read all the reviews on this Panera and it's sad not one nice review, I will NEVER return.  The area of food prep was not that clean and it was 345 in the afternoon why were 2 cartons of egg whites sitting out and sone of the veggies were not covered!!!  Health dept where are you?"}
{"text":"Panera is just ok to me. I mean, if you're looking for a quick lunch it's all right. But I will tell you they are so stingy with the meat on either a salad or a sandwich. They're a little bit overpriced for what you get. But again - OK if you're just looking for a quick lunch. Very friendly employees and most of the time the place is average when it comes to cleanliness. I usually have to get someone to wipe off the table."}
{"text":"Updated again on 5/24/18:
Horrible! Again, they are always out of breakfast items. I just don't understand it. Why can't they ever keep enough egg soufflés ready and available? And there has been no response from management about my complaints either here on yelp or the ones that I've made in the store. It's so frustrating because in Gastonia there aren't really a lot of places to go and get breakfast. I know, I know I should be making my breakfast at home but like many of you I'm often in a hurry. I wish there were more breakfast options in Gastonia. If somebody would open up a restaurant that served halfway healthy breakfast items they would make a lot of money.




Update: i'm downgrading my rating from 2 stars to 1. This Panera bread makes me so annoyed in the morning. I order from the mobile app in order to have my food ready when I get there. 9 times out of 10 they never have the egg soufflés ready. The problem is they still have them available on their website. So I order expecting my food to be ready when I get there. But then I sit there and I wait and I wait and I wait. After going past the time that it's supposed to be ready I ask them where is my food? They say oh we are out of egg soufflés. So no one was going to tell me that you're out? You just see me sitting there and no one says anything. This is like the fifth time this is happened.

So the first thing I will say about this location is that the employees are very friendly. After that it is extremely disappointing to come into an establishment that is known for breakfast and for them to always be running out of or be out of items. For instance, the soufflés - they never make enough. And when you ask for them they're always \"in the oven\". Fruit cups are rarely available. They never have enough people working up at the register. Therefore the lines are long. I don't understand how you can be a business that is known for breakfast and always be running out of things."}
{"text":"I love studying here on the weekends! The food is delicious, the coffee has free refills, the staff is friendly, and the wi-fi is free. My favorite menu item is the cheddar broccoli soup. I usually get the \"Pick Two\" in which you can pick any two menu items from their soup, salad, and sandwich lists. Their pastries are excellent too, especially the cheese danish. 

If you come regularly, be sure to sign up for their rewards program. I redeemed my first reward today, a free pastry, and was immediately awarded my second: a free smoothie or expresso on my next visit. Who doesn't love freebies?!"}
{"text":"I like the food you provide. It's pricy, no doubt, but that's ok. I enjoy it. This store, however, has the worst customer service I've ever experienced at a Panera. I'll order food here again in the future, but I'll never eat it there. I've never had employees be so obnoxious that it ruined my lunch time. Firstly, if they don't operate the register then they shouldn't be standing behind one. I approached the counter and was ignored by the 4 woman standing behind it. Much more interested in each other than assisting any customers. Secondly, once I sat, another employee demanded that her colleague speak to her as if she's a guest. They argued that point loudly... And excessively. Can you please ask your staff to simmer down in the dining room? They're ruining your guests lunch hours."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Took away the vegan options for the fall and now there are 0 vegan soups.  Ordered a sandwich online and requested no cheese, picked up my order and when I went to eat it (after leaving) there was EXTRA cheese.  Horrible service, pick up orders never ready.  Take your $7 for a sandwich somewhere else!!"}
{"text":"Well yet again did not have black bean even though it was in the board. Husbands chicken was pink on the inside oh and did I mention we had a big black hair in our salad. Will be our LAST trip to this panera. Avoid this location at all costs!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I eat at this location quite regularly. For a while the management was a little suspect, because the place wasn't very clean and the staff was not very efficient. However, here recently they must have got some new management especially at night because the place is much better.
The last couple of times it has been very clean, and the food was good, staff was efficient.
Would once again definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars just cause I'm usually a fan of Panera bread. Especially their pecan rolls. 

Only downside though is this one does not have enough outlets! :( More outlets please."}
{"text":"I like Paradise Bakery, but this location has such horrible parking! Every time I think about going to this location, I think about the parking and instantly I decide to go somewhere else. The fact that people camp out in the dinning area is the reason why there is no parking for people who want to get it to go! Grandma go home!

The quality of their food has decreased from when it first opened. The salads are no longer mixed in the large salad mixing bowls before they put it in your bowl. Sorry, but you can't mix the dressing into the salad as good in a tiny bowl. You need a salad mixing bowl for mixing. Also they stopped putting cherry tomatoes on the salads and instead use tomato wedges? Now with inferior ingredients and the same great price?!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to get a pick two from the menu.  The food was good, a little different, but OVERpriced.  The dining area was clean and well-kept.  They had a posted sanitation grade of 98.5!  The restrooms were also clean.  I would definitely eat there more often if the prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Panera is one of my favorites! Always fresh and always delicious. They have a great variety of hearty and also healthy choices.  I'm at this location all the time and it's rare that I don't get excellent service. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. All of their soups are really good, but the broccoli and cheddar is amazing! Mac & cheese is another favorite! If you're looking for something sweet, try the cinnamon crunch bagel (toasted). Sign up for a rewards card to earn free coffee and pastries"}
{"text":"Although I miss my Paradise Café, I can still get some of my favorite things here at Panera.  This location is convenient when shopping or for a working day lunch.  Although Tempe Marketplace is a busy place, you can usually find parking not too far away on a weekday. 

My favorite is the 1/2 & 1/2 -  your combo choice of salad, sandwich, flatbread or soup.  I usually get the tomato soup, but opted for the Autumn Squash along with 1/2 a chicken salad sandwich.  The service was pretty speedy - they brought it to my table when ready.  Everything was tasty and fresh.   Just what I needed.  

I noticed they had iPad stations at the entrance for preorders, but I didn't take the time to check them out - they were being used, so will check that out on my next visit."}
{"text":"Food is great, price isn't so much and portion sizes are minimal. Atmosphere is ideal! Internet speeds are slow. Staff was nice n friendly. 
Would be a regular if prices were more approachable."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but the employees here are always grumpy and not very helpful. If you are just looking for a bagel or sandwich, I would order ahead just so you don't have to deal with them. I really wish I could get a little bit of a smile with my coffee or an intelligible response to my question than just a grunt. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Bread Bowl Heaven!

Feeling under the weather or not, I love their bread bowls! My favorite is their Broccoli Cheddar. 

This place is pretty big too! And it can get busy! Amanda, one of the workers is really nice and answered all my questions I had. 

I love it here and will continue to come back :)"}
{"text":"First time at this location. Good spot on Royalton Road. Plenty of parking. We ordered the pick two. Fast service and we came during lunch so the vibe was a little noisy and hectic. They do good business. Like the rest."}
{"text":"This is a welcomed addition to our neighborhood. I come here often and my wife and I are always happy. I like the calorie count next to all of the menu items. We did rapid pick up this time but it wasn't so rapid(a little over half an hour behind schedule) It was in the middle of lunch and I understand. Overall the restaurant is clean and well kept. In this location an employee has always managed to grab my dirty plates and garbage off of the table before I have the chance to do it. The bakery displays are always well organized and filled and everyone from the front to the pickup is friendly.  A+ service for fast casual! Will recommend and be back!"}
{"text":"I agree with everyone else, skip the lines. They're full of indecisive families of ten. 

Onto the food, I had a bbq flatbread and mac and cheese. The flatbread was average. The ingredients were fresh and tasty but the bread itself was cold and just very sad. The mac and cheese had nice flavor but the noodles were soggy.

Overall the food isn't awful and it's a nice clean place to eat, but with so many better dining options steps away (Cafe Zupas, Pita Jungle, Suace) , I don't see why you'd go to Panera."}
{"text":"This location is weirdly claustrophobic due to the layout. Most Paneras I've encountered separate their bakery and sandwich counters, but here they're combined. It leads to a glut of people when you first enter the door. There are a couple of iPads set up on the far right side where it appears you can place your own orders - I didn't notice it when I came in due to aforementioned group of people huddled around the register, but I will give it a go the next time I'm in and I haven't preordered. 

Another thing leading to the bottleneck is the Rapid Pick-Up shelf is along the same corridor where you pick up your food at the counter instead of near the entrance. This causes further back-up while people try to find their orders as others are waiting. 

The food is just as it is at other Paneras - in the last year or so I've been unable to break the habit of ordering the Turkey Avocado BLT - you get actual pieces of turkey and large slices of avocado, and the sandwich is surprisingly not terrible for you considering its size. It's a bit pricey, but I'd rather down this than a greasy fast food burger most days."}
{"text":"This location is fine. Paneras are pretty consistent across the board, but tend to vary in two spots: 
1) Service
2) Preparation

Service: great, actually. Surprisingly so. A line had started to form and another worker stepped up to open a second register. Realizing there was still another line, yet another person came up to run a third register so all were manned. I don't think I've ever seen this at any establishment, let alone a fast-food style place. 

Preparation: not so great. I got the Turkey Avocado BLT, my go-to order. The bread pieces were a bit small for the contents of the sandwich (likely the end of a loaf) and had a crazy amount of mayo on it. The mayo was also regular mayo instead of the sandwich's usual olive oil mayo - not a huge deal, but I've actually found the olive oil mayo tastes considerably better. The avocado on the sandwich was just a couple of big chunks instead of slices or more manageable pieces, causing them to fall out and only be in a couple of bites instead of evenly distributed. For almost $10, I expect a little more. I know they were busy but I'm happy to wait another two minutes to have my sandwich put together in a less sloppy fashion. 

Not the best trip I've had to a Panera, but not bad in and of itself - I know they're capable of better, though, so it was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Food is fine. Same as any other Paradise Bakery.

I wanted to comment on the Internet though. If you're coming here to study, and you like streaming music while you work to get your groove on, get ready for lots of interrupted music :( I  can't even connect very well to Google docs/sheets which is very annoying. I would move, but don't want to pay for another coffee at another spot. 

Thank goodness I can hotspot my phone!

On the plus side, coffee has free refills here so you can caffeinate yourself until you burst while you work."}
{"text":"Stoped at this restaurant to get a chicken salad sandwich to go. I frequent Panera Bread when I am on the road as they are consistent in quality. What separates them is the staff. 

When I picked up my sandwich I placed the pager on the counter and stepped away with an ice tea in on hand and my sandwich bag in the other. The millennial behind the counter says, \"the pager goes in the basket\".  The pager is equidistant between us.  I hold up my hands to say, \"my hands are full could you help?\"  He just glanced at the basket. I put the sandwich down and tossed the pager in the basket. Customer service at this store has its limits."}
{"text":"I order rapid pickup from this Panera all the time because I work very close. I haven't had any issues. I'm surprised by all the negative reviews on here. Panera in general is a bit pricey but the food is good. I think it's really good at this location."}
{"text":"Don't get a to-go order from here. Our office order, in which 4 people ordered and paid separately for was all wrong. I initially was missing my sandwich and salad, only to discover it was in someone else's bag. Other coworker got the wrong sandwich and no salad, another got the wrong dressing and cheese on her salad. And the restaurant wasn't busy. When we called, we were offered vouchers to come back but that was really inconvenient for us. They did refund us our money in the end."}
{"text":"Where do I even start. 

I would like to say that Panera has been one of our favorites for my family and I. Today after church we stopped by this location, we are a family of 4, we come in and begin to place our order. My husband began to order a Quinoa and lentil bowl, before he he even finish his order the girl at the register stops him and says \"Hold on, let me make sure we have some\" leaves and comes back confirming they were out. Okay, a little disappointing but we just ordered something else. Secondly, once we were done ordering, 2 kids meals, 2 adults, 2 drinks and juice boxes the total was $40!! $40. I don't remember the prices being so high! 
Once we were don't eating one of my kids ask if they can go bye more bread, preferably the bread that comes on the side with the soup or salad. When my husband goes up to counter to order the cashier says \" we can only sell that bread with an actual order of food. Not alone\" which is completely crazy since I'm wanting to pay for it! We ended up ordering 2 pastries and a croissant not only was it $9 but while ordering the girl said we can only have the brownies that were by the front. We asked if they were freshly made or if they were the older ones they want to get rid of. She assured us they were fresh. My 4 year old tried to take a bite and couldn't it was rock hard. We even tried to cut it with a knife, it took my husband to even cut it down the middle. We left so disappointed, sorry but this was our last visit. Never again."}
{"text":"I was here earlier in the week to meet somebody for a business lunch. I ordered an everything bagel with tomato and cream cheese and a bowl of chicken noodle soup. 

The soup was fine. But the toasted bagel came undressed with my 2 slices of tomato in a little cup and little sealed pre-packed thing of cream cheese. This seemed odd since they make sandwiches - they can't dress your bagel?

Also the cream cheese had an odd taste to it... Sort of blue-cheese-esque. I double checked to make sure they had given me plain cream cheese. Yup plain cream cheese. The bagel was pretty bland - a bit disappointing for an everything bagel. 

It is what it is... The service was polite and fast."}
{"text":"This is definitely my go to spot if I want some good to eat but not heavy on the stomach. There's a lot of healthy options and a lot of not so healthy options if you have a sweet tooth"}
{"text":"Panera is great. Food is spectacular. However this location is horrible. Customer service is non-existant here. You are made to feel like they are doing you a favor by taking your order or providing your food. go to another location or restaurant. This one is BAD!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was great. We came to Chez Vous and didn't realize they're closed until the end of the month, so we decided to come here instead. They have a bunch of iPads to order from and we almost went to the front register but didn't see the lunch menu listed on the boards, so we came back to the iPads. Being our first time at this chain, we were a bit confused about how to order but it was pretty easy using the tablets. We placed our orders (pick two was a popular choice) and paid and got a order number with the buzzer things. It didn't take long for our food to be brought out to us and everything looked fresh and delicious. A few of us ordered the same items: watermelon feta salad, spicy Thai chicken salad, chicken salad sandwich, and we got a few soups and breakfast items as well as drinks. 

Prices were reasonable considering the amount of food we got and I enjoyed everything that I tried, especially the tomato soup and cinnamon crunch bagel. My iced mocha tasted more like milk than coffee but it was still good. I really liked how customizable everything was, you can add and subtract toppings and sides as you please which made it a little confusing because some things were forgotten. However, they were good about giving us what they missed. Overall, I'd definitely come back and try some new items."}
{"text":"Fast service and clean atmosphere. Sad they don't have the Sierra turkey anymore. Wish I could remember the recipe as the turkey taste different?. I know bread is different but what r u gonna do. Food is fresh."}
{"text":"This is seriously the absolute worst Panera. Everyone is super rude and on top of it they are incompetent. I stood at the cash register for 10 minutes of my lunch break trying to use a coupon and it took the fifth try for the girl to say it's not eligible with this item. Okay well after waiting 10 minutes they better make it eligible. So ridiculous. And the assistant manager is so rude. Just spoke to him. Christopher was yelling at his employees in front of me almost tried not to remake my soggy sandwich."}
{"text":"\"Good place for a coffee (not espresso) and a conversation\"


Panera Bread is a chain of bakery/restaurants that offers a selection of sandwiches, salads and limited drinks. It mostly appears to be a place where people go to have a coffee and a conversation. And many others use it as an office. I once saw a customer with an external keyboard and a power cord with duct tape. It looked she she was going to be a while.

The food is average at best. The descriptions on their website set a high expectation. The actual food itself is much less spectacular. If you're looking for a classic bacon and eggs or pancake breakfast, go to Daylight Grill in Clarkson (the best in Mississauga in my opinion). If you're looking for a good bagel that happens to have some bacon and egg in it, Panera might do.

The healthy offerings include sandwiches like the Avocado with Egg White and Spinach. The sandwich itself has a few leaves of spinach, a flat white disk or an egg white and a couple of pieces of avocado covered with melted cheese.

The Fruit Cocktail mentioned in the online menu is actual akin to what you might get on a coffee truck.....a small plastic glass with grape and honeydew melon packed in the cup with a couple of other fruits. The interior is also getting dated with chipped tables and dark benches (except for the small area near the windows).

For a conversation with some coffee or tea and a quick bagel sandwich, Panera may be ok for breakfast, however I would really not classify it as a \"breakfast restaurants\". Again the main offering at \"Panera Bread\", is the bread. Everything else is a concoction of bread and something else. The food preparation is \"clinical\" with the perception that everything is carefully measured, prepared and offered for quick service."}
{"text":"The main reason for my review is the customer service at this location is excellent!  Zachary helped me with my order and was very helpful.  I can't stand  that the chipotle chicken sandwich is gone. He said they could make something similiar and it came out delicious. I also love their Greek Salad. My husband is not a fun so I go with my children every so often. The muffins are fresh."}
{"text":"Panera bread has good pastries.  Coffee is pretty fresh.  I ordered a croissant egg and cheese sandwich and what was good.  

The prices for breakfast are a little high.  They don't offer turkey bacon.  The cashier did not seem to want to be there.  He was not friendly at all.  I think he needed some coffee because it was too early for him."}
{"text":"The establishment was dirty. From the drink bar to the tables. The floor was dirty with food and paper. The food was mediocre, my soup came to me cold and my steak sandwich had a tiny piece of meat. We will not be back, over all spent $50 for 4 meals."}
{"text":"I am loyal to Paradise Bakery so much that I use their catering service throughout the valley. I've visited this Panera Bread twice and each time I was disappointed. I was disappointed the first visit because the item I ordered wasn't the same - different ingredients? The service was great! The second time they ran out of croutons and I had to haggle for an additional baguette.  The bakery is limited and being at the end of the day the selection was scarce. I actually prefer the setup over Paradise Bakery's but it's diminishing menu and lack of cookie with the pick-two selection (yet, an increase in price) won't have me coming back."}
{"text":"\"Accuracy Matters\" is the only thing in a bold font on their receipt, yet my order was wrong and I couldn't get anybody on the phone to resolve my issue. I spent over $20 on a half a grilled cheese sandwich, a steak sandwich and a bowl of broccoli cheddar soup. I got to work only to find that I recieved chicken noodle soup, which was very disappointing because I was planning to dip my steak sandwich in it. I tried to call the store and listened to the phone ring for several minutes, several times after selecting the option to speak to the manager. There was no option to leave a message to get a call back."}
{"text":"Worst access I have ever ever experienced.  The doors not only don't have a handicap assist but they are angled making it even more difficult.  None of the drink supplies like lids and straws are reachable and stuff pretend your not there.  I actually had a staff member step over me as I was struggling to get drinks to the table. Would never recommend for anyone who is otherwise abled."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick drink.

Got a caramel latte $4.49 and a frozen mocha $4.99

Both tasted great. Perfect sweetness for me so didn't have to add any sugar.

Not sure if its just me but I find that all Panera Bread locations I have went to the design and layout are exactly the same. Not sure why but I also find that when I'm at Panera Bread it feels like a breakfast diner rather than a coffee shop. I guess I'm just too use to Timmies."}
{"text":"I could sit here all day and much on all the baked goods and guzzle down cappuccino after cappuccino. On this visit I got a cream of broccoli soup, a chocolate chip muffin and a mint flavored cappuccino. Might not sound like much but it lasted forever because portions were large. The soup was nice and thick and just right on the creamy flavor. Everything tasted great. With the great quality you do pay for it at the end though. Prices are a bit high but its definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This place is super! The tasty bread and soup always cures my hangovers!!!"}
{"text":"Bacon Turkey Bravo with Bravo Sauce on the side.

I love Panera Bread and they have a great rewards card/ points program, that gives you point every time you make a purchase at any location.

My favorite thing to order is the Bacon Turkey Bravo of course with kettle chips and a yummy chocolate chip cookie. On my recent visit to this location it was late Wednesday night and the store was pretty empty. I walked right up to the register and ordered my food, and with in a few minutes my delicious sandwich was ready. 

The overall appearance of the store was pretty good, they just needed to restock their bakery goods. The staff were really nice and friendly and I would defiantly return whenever I am craving a delicious sandwhich."}
{"text":"Panera I feel is a place you go when you're looking for a quick homey meal. The items on the menu really aren't anything special, but simple sandwiches, soups & baked goods. However, I think it's the atmosphere that helps this place out. Instead of being at home and trying to make these meals, you can go grab a friend, sit down & enjoy the cozy space. 

I'm not exaggerating by how comfy the seating area is. There's a lot of room, it's not too loud, they play calming music & the lighting is great. Also, there's a whole foods near by which is always a plus. 

Nonetheless, these items are definitely a little pricey for what they are and the portions they give. Wish they were a little more generous with the serving. I ordered the cheddar broccoli soup & my friend got the standard chicken noodle soup. Their soups are $6.49 & come with your choice of apples, chips or a piece of baguette.

My soup was really good for the first half, but it was really heavy towards the end & the flavour got a little bit too repetitive. With the bread, however, it was definitely better. Only issue is the piece of bread they give is very small. Still a pretty solid dish if you're craving a soup. 

The chicken noodle soup was good for a chicken noodle soup, but to pay $7 for it is a little ridiculous. It wasn't as oily or hardy as other chicken noodle soups, but they did give a good amount of chicken. For a soup with less thick consistency the portion was definitely not enough."}
{"text":"I love this spot. I come here twice a week! It is usually busy during lunch time but with the 3 kiosks and the cashiers, ordering goes by fast. Once I sit, the food typically comes out in less than 5 minutes which is awesome! The salad is ALWAYS crisp and fresh, sandwiches and always yummy and the soup is bomb. And the amount of food is perfect whether I get the half servings or full. Desserts and coffee and always tasty too. But the service there is PHENOMENAL :) everyone is super friendly. I once forgot to order chicken with my salad and I asked one of the employees who was cleaning the area if I could get chicken and said of course and brought it right out to me. Good service good food!!"}
{"text":"Been eating here for years, usually decent foods and good service.  Here a week ago ordered their large garden salad and bowl of soup.  As we sat down to eat our lunch I noticed a thin, light brown item, about inch and a half long on top of my greens.  At first I thought it was an Asian Noodle that got in the salad by mistake.  When I looked more closely I realized it was a sharp piece of willow \"wicker\", as in from a basket. 
I realized it probably fell in by mistake, but thought I should tell management so that they are more careful.  It would have been hard to miss for the prep people, unless they never looked.  Also, super dangerous because of how hard, thin and sharp this item is had it been in the bottom of the bowl or hidden.  The youngish assistant manager was polite, and upon looking at the item conferred that it was wicker.  He stated that they had large wicker baskets above their prep area, where they keep the bowls and it probably fell in that way.  
No \"sorry it happened, we are going to address this so that it doesn't ever happen again\"......No, let us get you a courtesy dessert or tea or something.  Really poor, clueless and underwhelming response about the seriousness of the  situation.  Sad fact is, if it should happen to some other guest they may not even realize until they mess up their intestines with a sharp, lacquered piece of willow from a wicker basket.  As I said in the beginning, been eating here for years without ever a problem, but this was more than a minor thing to me, and the staff just didn't seem to be trained to recognize the seriousness.  Panera needs to ditch the wicker baskets around the prep areas, they are indeed dangerous.  Who would have ever guessed."}
{"text":"Ok, I know Panera is a chain restaurant, but I still like it. Especially on a hot day like today, a \"You Pick Two\" seems like a winner. I'm a HUGE fan of the You Pick Two and since I am pretty mundane when it comes to sandwiches....I always order the Sierra Turkey with no Onions and possibly the Mac and Cheese, Broccoli Cheddar Soup or the Chicken Noodle Soup. The bread is always soft and there is plenty of turkey in the sandwich to make me feel like I'm fully satisfied. Overall, Panera is one of my favorite lunch joints to go to."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for a restaurant at a rest stop. They have a dining area next to the kitchen with booths like a normal Panera, but you also get access to some tables underneath the rest stop's dome and skylights. Pro tip: get a glass of water, put some lemons into it, and sit smugly at those tables while you watch customers at the Burger King next door fill up their 24-oz sodas."}
{"text":"The food is alright at this location. The dining area is clean enough. The tables are always wet after they wipe them down, which I'm not a fan of since I'm sure the rag isn't that clean. But I wonder if the idea is to make it obvious it's been wiped down, like when you leave lines on the carpet when vacuuming. 

Anyway,  the food is pretty decent, which is what I rate primarily when reviewing. The foods gotta be good. The cashier was polite but young, so I felt that little bit of sass you get from teenagers who hate their job."}
{"text":"WHERE IS THE SOUTHWEST CHICKEN CAESAR SALAD?!?! I miss paradise bakery. Panera Bread is good but not as good as paradise bakery. It's just not the same"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are just ok. Soup is bland and taste like it has been frozen and thawed. 

Pastries bagels and bread are tasty. Tea and coffee are great. 

Service is getting better. Cleanliness of the restaurant is good."}
{"text":"I love panera bread. I visit this location frequently. I don't know if it's because of the high volume of customers or what, but today was a bad experience their. Usually the staff is always helpful and very nice. Today my cashier who took my order was extremely rude and unprofessional. They rushed me while taking my order & still got my order wrong. I Asked for no mayo or tomatoes. My Sandwich was drowned in mustard. The entire sandwich is soggy and nasty"}
{"text":"This location was absolutely packed during our visit. I've never walked into a Panera with every table taken, a line of customers and a full parking lot. People were literally making their own parking spots in the lot. That's reason enough to avoid this place.

However, the line did move quickly and the customer service was wonderful. We were given a number and our order was brought out to us, something I'm not used to. It was nice to have runners bringing out food! 

Hubs and I split a pick 2. The meal tasted as expected, no complaints with the food. I also like the selection of Fresca drinks, another thing we do not have at our Panera in Ohio. 

Overall, it's an okay place to stop if you have a quick meeting you need to attend (we did). But to have an enjoyable lunch here? Pass."}
{"text":"If you like Paradise Bakery then you'll love Panera...I mean...they're pretty much the same establishment!

My mom and I visited this location on a Monday morning for breakfast. The service was great! Everyone was friendly and made menu recommendations. We ordered breakfast sandwiches and a scone. Their fresh drink choices are just okay. I wish they had the Mango Iced Tea that Paradise has.

The restaurant was clean and there were a lot of people there enjoying themselves. I'm pretty sure this place is relatively new; therefore, they probably needed sometime to get into their rhythm. However, I'm still surprised by the amount of negative comments. 

I love that their restaurant is making a shift to use more non-GMO and organic items. This is a huge plus. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I used to like coming to this new location in town since it is closer to my house and it's neat. However, my most recent visit now has me hesitate coming here when deciding what to eat on Sunday morning.

No one welcomed us as we walked in, so we decided to order with the kiosk. It went smoothly, but there was really nowhere to seat in the restaurant- they were either occupied-which were only about 5 tables- or dirty. So we decided to wipe the tables ourselves and sit down. Then, when we headed to the drink station, nothing was stocked- No lids, no tongs to grab lemons, no napkins, no knives for butter. Okay, so we asked the employees who were just chillin' at the food expo line to get these for us, then they did- but no one seemed to care to clean the tables. 

When we got our foods, we were even more disappointed. Our tomato bisque in a bread bowl had barely no soup because there was so much bread left in the bowl. The french onion soup was alright, but still not enough cheese, or flavor to it.

The overall experience was subpar, and I would rather go to the one in Fort Apache since they have better customer service, friendlier staff, and better food."}
{"text":"Greek salad with chicken was off the charts awesome.  Other reviews mentioning they need to do a better job cleaning hit home when I went to find a table.  Nothing disgusting but there's a reason we're at Panera and not McDonald's so disappointed to see dirty since I'm a fan of Panera nationwide.  The complaints about pricing are agreeable, but it's part of the inflation everywhere that comes when politicians get elected who pander to the poor and in reality hurt them the most and help the wealthy EVERY time throughout history but people don't learn.  Enjoy the high price of everything when out of control government gives money to people for free and cares more about other countries than it's own people."}
{"text":"It's been 1 hour I'm still waiting for half a sandwich. No sense of urgency. Lazy kitchen staff!"}
{"text":"Listen, I have to agree with most others. Yes, Panera is expensive for what you're getting. But if you're in Solon, you know there's a serious lack of coffee shops in this city. Your options are Panera or Starbucks. As a work from home-r and someone with a lot of graduate student friends, meeting to work is kind of my thing.

This location is always dirty. If you're coming here, be prepared to bus a table before you sit in it. I always have to decide which I think is the least disgusting to sit at, wipe it down with napkins and throw away the trash (they should give me a discount on my meal for my cleaning work). Yes, I know I could just not come here, but every time I hope it will be better than the last, and again, horrendous lack of options in the area and it will do in a crunch.

Also, be prepared to wait over 20+ minutes if you're getting food, even if it's just a bowl of soup. Again, half the time, we're also working, so it doesn't mind us too greatly, but the hairs on your head may grey if you're just standing by the pick-up counter. All gazillion people currently standing around the corner look like they're about to Hulk out. I totally get it from a staff side- half the people that work at Panera are kids that have to be trained, but they look so miserable while doing so.

Pros: coffee is always fresh and the Panera pick-up shelf in the back has always been on time for me. Pastries are always fresh. Maybe skip lunch and go straight for the sweets."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite!  It fills up quick around lunch time but the staff is always friendly and efficient, so you're in an out of line way before you're ready to make a decision from there vast menu of food.  I usually get the soup in the bread bowl, with a side of bread and some sandwich on the side!  mmmm... Carbs!  Check it out, you definitely won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Paneraaaaa 

Before coming here, I knew what to expect . Now I know that Panera is a chain food place, however I honestly thought the food was good. I got the Broccoli Cheddar soup with an apple, AND i loved it. It actually Tasted like something that my mom made for me once. I'm not really a soup person but when I do drink it, it has to be really good. After that soup rendezvous, I bought myself a coffee and a pecan roll & cinnamon roll. I love cinnamon & pecans. All the drinks here are refillable including coffee, soft drinks, tea etc. not to mention all the diff kinds of coffee roasts they have here. 

Now I'll say this much, I'll take a soup here before a soup from Tim Hortons any day any time. Yup I said it. Sorry #imnotsorry. As for the coffee I'm not so sure."}
{"text":"Love the salads and sandwhichh a although I thought it seems overpriced. However, I tried the half pasta today? And the size is smaller than the soup. Not worth 6.99. I'm very disappointed in the quantity and the chicken on top tastes like ham and not cooked well. I will only be coming for a sandwhich in the future. Even the salads are very slim here."}
{"text":"This place sucks they have never made my food right and I order the same exact thing every time and the shift supervisor taking my order was very rude. Never order their Mac n cheese because it tastes like spoiled milk and they will never be able to make it like the other panera locations! I have specifically came in here and asked them to make it right, and they do! So I know they are just being lazy and not doing something right. And whenever I complain they just offer me something else. I come here just for the mac n cheese man."}
{"text":"Bought cookies there today. The sugar cookies and snicker doodles were both underdone.  Called and told them. They did not care. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The weather here in Vegas has been crazy for the past 6+ weeks.  It's hot, it's cold, now it's raining but wait oh now it's snowing.  Did I mention the crazy winds in addition to our crazy w eather...what Global Warming?  No Global Warming is that new dance group, there are on tour w/ Bruno Mars right now.  So on 1 our hectic cold, windy days it just seem so right to get my fav blanket and a cup of soup.  A cup of soup in a bread bowl, YASSSSSS.  Not just any cup of soup but some BROCCOLI n CHEDDAR soup, YASSSSSS PLEASE.  

Do you guys know how good Panera's Broccoli n Cheddar soups? O-M-Geeeeee, together w/ the sourdough bread.  Really as I typed this my mouth is watering, the saltiness of the soup paired with the sourness of the bread, but wait...the bread is nice and crunchy on the outside and super soft inside.  Once you pour your soup in the bowl, the soup totally soaks up the bread but then you have this combination of mushy/chewy/crunchy goodness.  When the soup is gone, start to pull away at the bread, there is broccoli n cheddar goodness locked in those sourdough pockets YASSSSSSS!  I am really stuck on the Broccoli n Cheddar soup at Panera, I mean everything is good at Panera, you can't go wrong.  

Can I say BREAKFAST SANDWICH w/ the runny egg?  Yes, yes I will say Breakfast Sandwich and it is freaking delicious."}
{"text":"Never have I had a bad experience here. I typically order ahead online or by using their app which is so easy and convenient. The food is ready and waiting in a little pickup area for me to just grab and go. If I eat in I use the kiosk that lets you order yourself. It's usually faster than going through the regular line and you can double check any modifications before submitting the order. 

I'm addicted to the Fuji Apple chicken salad and hope they never get rid of it. I've also had other salads and sandwiches but this is, by far, the best thing on the menu. I rarely get bakery items there but when I have they've always been great. 

Love Panera Bread! The quality of the food is worth the price."}
{"text":"This Panera is good but not as good as my favorite at Concord Mills. Parking is atrocious so I always try to go at an \"off\" time. The interior is dark and oddly arranged. On the plus side, there is outdoor seating if the weather is nice. I've not had any issues with my orders either being wrong or taking too long. The food is is every bit as good as any other Panera location. The only reason I'm marking this location down is for atmosphere and parking. It makes me want to go elsewhere in an area where there are so many restaurant choices."}
{"text":"Panera, your sandwiches are small and expensive, but I love you anyway because you're the closest place to my apartment to get a decent sandwich. As Amy mentioned in her review, there is also some sweet people-watching at this location. Sit near the intersection of Detroit and St. Charles and marvel in the weirdos, teens, old people, yuppies, punks, and young parents of Lakewood."}
{"text":"This review is soley based on my first, which is also my last visit.

I order 3 items; all underwhelming, disappointing, and overpriced.

1. Four cheese souffle $4.95 - It was soggy inside so it was mushy. Not appetitizing to say the least.

2. French onion soup $6.xx - This was better than the other 2 items, but too salty for my liking. Not to mention the size of a 'bowl' only comes to four gulps at most.

3. Grilled cheese $7.99 - THIS WAS A COMPLETE RIP OFF. One side was grilled, cheap cheese, bland plastic taste (they obviously dont use butter). My high school cafeteria made better grilled cheese for $3. 

I got an apple and a baguette for sides. 

This one star is for friendly service. Not that I could give it any lower.

What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I like Panera and frequent multiple locations often. Not all Panera locations are equal however. I just ordered a half portion of the Asian sesame chicken salad.  It couldn't be any more skimpy!  This is my go-to salad at all Panera bakeries and I have never been served a portion like this!!  Come on Matthews Panera, stop being so chintzy!!  I'll have to go back to the Arboretum for a decent salad."}
{"text":"Executive summary: finding a spot to sit and parking in their lot can be difficult during busy lunch hours and sometimes even after work.  Restrooms are clean.  Food is good with several vegetarian options but few choices for gluten sensitive folks.

As the name Panera Bread would imply, this isn't the best place for gluten sensitive folks.  You're probably safe with a salad and some of the non-noodle soups but otherwise most everything is served on their delicious bread.  I've not seen a gluten free bread option yet but maybe some day.

If you're not sensitive to gluten you can enjoy one of their sandwiches on a range of bread choices from thick cut honey wheat, to ciabattta, to flatbread and focaccia.  They also have several varieties of bagels with specialty cream cheese spreads.  My favorite back in my days of gluten was the cinnamon crunch bagel with regular cream cheese.  YUM.

They have convenient online ordering and you can even order from your table if you're at the restaurant.  I've used the online ordering several times and my orders have been correct every time and ready at the time I selected.

Free wifi is limited to only 1/2 hour during busy periods but you'll still see people camped out at tables using mifi or hotspots.

If you're looking for a quick bite and it's not busy this is a good option.  Otherwise, I recommend ordering ahead and taking your lunch to go."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE:
Really nice, lots of comfy seating and tables and booths of various sizes.  Outlets and wifi are available too.  If you're lucky you can get a seat near the fireplace.

FOOD:
The food is alright at this location, I've had better but it's not horrible.  It's a bit pricey though."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken melt and it arrived with not so fresh avocado. I expect more from Panera and will not order again. Disgusting."}
{"text":"I've tried a variety of foods from here, but the dessert is probably the best thing on the menu. I keep coming back for their brownie and scones. The panini/flatbread is also pretty good."}
{"text":"Unlike Einstein's bagels at Scottsdale rd and Lincoln, the staff here are very pleasant and polite.

Fast polite service and good, clean quality food.."}
{"text":"My husband and I often grab lunch here when running around on a Saturday. The food is always great. I found it relatively disturbing that two employees were out in the seated portion of the restaurant cleaning, talking about smoking pot. Not exactly the family friendly environment I think of when I think of Panera."}
{"text":"I was in such a great mood. Having an awesome day, and then I stepped into the Paradise bakery. What kind of place stops serving breakfast at 10 AM?

It was 10:14am 

Their other food is actually amazing. But I was really looking forward to breakfast."}
{"text":"We just spent $18 on one smoothie. We are in between softball games. We were looking for something healthy. We went to this restaurant and no one taking our order told us that they were running behind. It got  to the point we could not wait. I walked up and asked for the smoothie that had been sitting on the counter. We finally had to leave but not before being offered two danishes for lunch. No thanks.

Our $18 lunch consisted of one smoothie. And I can promise you the staff did not care."}
{"text":"Great place and fresh food! Especially if you want a light lunch like soup and maybe a sandwich. Otherwise definitely try out the mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Food is at best mediocre. Portion size was small. The place was neither bright or cozy with a slightly funky smell... not sure if it was clean because the tables felt sticky too. Soup was way too salty. I don't think we will return."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Panera as a whole, but this particular location SUCKS! They hardly every get my delivery order right. I mean I just don't get it, they offer customizations, but does anyone read them, it doesn't matter how simple the change is, so now once again I'm waiting for them to redeliver my order. Spoke to the manager Jonathan, who's excuse was they were busy, ummm why is that my problem. You still have an obligation to produce accurate orders. Now back to the food. This stores food freshness is lacking, they are hit or miss with wilted lettuce and bad avocados. Once my avocado was so bad it was black, like they had to see that while preparing it, would they want to eat that, would they feed that to their family? For as much as we spend on this supposedly fresh food with quality ingredients, they need to get it together!"}
{"text":"I would suggest a new name for your Rapid Pickup. Maybe Slow Your Roll or Wanna be Fast But Can't or why in such a hurry people?"}
{"text":"My go to place before afternoon classes at Sennott Sq. It gets really crowded during day time, sometimes noisy. Otherwise a good place to do some last minute study before your midterm or final."}
{"text":"Very good location and good interior and exterior. Nice and clean spacious place. Visited here with a bunch of kids; ordering a bunch of sweets. They loved this place. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at any Panera Bread. I ordered a full salad, a bowl of chicken soup and half a turkey sandwich for me and my co worker for pick up.
For 22$ I was expecting a lot better quality of food not to mention the size of the soup was so small for $6! 
When I walked in everyone looked really confused and not very helpful. It was a zoo. 
I probably won't be returning to any Panera Bread. Zupas on Stephanie street is way tastier, cheaper and has better customer service."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch in between meetings and to use the Wifi to get some work done. We found a table with an electrical outlet close to the table and set up shop - breaking out our MacBook Air and MacBook Pro - respectively.

Wifi speed was relatively fast. We arrived just before the lunch rush started. The place was packed during the lunch hour!

I ordered their French Onion soup and a soda. The soup was pretty tasty as French Onion soups go. They don't melt the cheese over the top of the soup - instead they throw a bit into the soup itself.

The service here was good, the folks I interacted with were very pleasant."}
{"text":"I don't like writing negative reviews, especially for one of my favorite chains, but they need to completely overhaul this place. 

Six times out of ten they will screw up your order. Nine times out of ten they will make you wait upwards of 30 minutes to get your 2-4 item takeout order. This is most likely because they only have 1 person working. Sure they have about 8 people clocked in, but they are just walking around the place like they're window shopping. Even the managers walk around with no discernible purpose while the one person in the back is messing up orders. 

One time after placing my order I waited 15 minutes. I was going to be late for work so I said, \"could someone please make the latte I order?\" The cashier turned to make my drink immediately. Why does a business need a second invitation to make my order? 

I once saw a lady who came to pick up her catering order ask why she had to wait 30 minutes after the scheduled pick up to get her order. I was so tempted to point out the two employees eating in a booth, the manager walking around with a clipboard, doing who knows what and at least three people wandering like zombies, but I'm sure she noticed. She left very frustrated. 

The one person I've had interaction with has been very nice. However a successful business can't survive on just nice. You have to also be competent--from the top down. 

Thanks for giving me the wrong sandwich AGAIN and no caramel in my latte, which was half foam anyway. 

I'm officially done with this location. Message me when you get better managers."}
{"text":"I was curious about this place, and have been wanting to check it out. I looked at the menu online a few times. When the card became available online, I snapped it up (I have a source for discount gift cards). 

I like the different choices and different offerings (Pick 2), the bread---I would go there just to buy some bread (the french baguette is yummy!), and the concept is good (responsible ingredients, just below Chipotle in scoring, BTW), the creamy mac & cheese is really good, too. And the kids meals are reasonable. I did notice that the pricing is a bit higher than regular casual restaurants, like neighbor, Chipotle (this is restaurant row, there are a ton of choices). I think I might've been more upset if I had paid regular price for the meal. Just to illustrate how much it was, our dinner was $31.94.

There was an avocado shortage and signs regarding that note was all posted all over. I wanted to try the Cobb salad, but got something instead because, what's the point? 

I opted for the \"Pick 2\": cashew chicken salad and the turkey apple cheddar sandwich on cranberry bread (soft). The salad was good, but I felt it was missing something for more balance on the flavors as it was pretty sweet (I didn't finish it). I liked the sandwich much better though the bread was not toasted. I usually like my bread toasted. That was the only downside. If we were going again, I would order something else. If it were cooler outside, I'd have ordered the soup. 

My husband got the \"Pick 2\": mac & cheese and steak sandwich; the mac & cheese was delicious, and the sandwich sucked---\"where 's the meat? it looks nothing like the picture.\" (yes, those were his words; I think he would score this one a 3 stars). 

Our son's meal @ $4.99 (was very good, though, the bread, he didn't eat much of it. His latest thing is he wants to take it home, but then he forgets about it. Don't worry, I've been eating it this week.

We got here a little later on a sunday night and there were some other customers (I think this was the tourist crowd), but it wasn't crowded. It was clean. The fountain drink station is towards the back near the bathrooms (womens has two stalls). The ordering counter and bakery is in the middle, once you walk in through the front doors. Service is good. They bring your food to your table. The seating is to the left and right of this area (kind of L-shaped space restaurant). I noticed a man had his laptop plugged into the wall. 

We might come here again, especially, if I get another card."}
{"text":"It pains me to rate this as A-OK but it really wasn't up to par.  First of all, I was disappointed that black bean soup wasn't available.  Next, our food was okay but didn't feel that it was overly good.  My in-laws and my wife were also mildly impressed.  I had a standard soup and salad and my dad was more courageous and tried something different.  I thought our happy hour at Monona Terrace was better."}
{"text":"Parking at this location can be a hassle. I am a huge fan of the order ahead app because of this. Also, I am a picky eater and like to see all the ingredients going into the sandwich so i can pick and choose what I want in it. You can select rapid pick-up or select a time in future. Your order will be ready and waiting for you on a shelf close to the counter. Very easy and convenient. Among my favorites here are the strawberry poppyseed salad with chicken and roasted turkey and avocado BLT, but with no T for me!. I always get that 99 cents baked good they throw in, usually a chocolate chipper. I never leave without a large passion papaya green tea. It's so refreshing."}
{"text":"Not worth the price! I'm willing to spend a lot of money on food if it's good, but Panera is just mediocre at best. Me and my boyfriend got a salad and small pasta bowl. The lady taking our order said we get free sides, such as a choice of chips and bread on the side. Well those sides were not free and added up and our total ended up being $30! Well I thought maybe its that good that it's worth $30. But it was not good. The salad was flavorless even with dressing, the pasta bowl was actually good, but our food was definitely not worth $30. Panera is just a fad and not all that hype. It was better when it was Paradise Bakery. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"I'm sitting here now doing some work on my laptop after a nice lunch. The food is consistent with other locations, I really enjoy their macaroni and cheese. The staff is friendly and helpful so far. Lots of employees, everything seems clean. The layout of the store is a bit strange (the fountain drink area is difficult to access and I can see it becoming crowded at busy periods) and there are not enough seats with access to outlets for those coming here to do work. The outdoor area is very nice. Also here they bring your food to you at your table with a fancy schmancy table tracker system.

The music playing in here makes me want to slit my wrists. It's Weather Channel-style soft jazz. And of course today is the day I forgot my headphones..."}
{"text":"When we're sick and tired of the same old thing and want to have something reasonably healthy, we come here! They have the best soups and sandwiches. The soups are what my husband craves when he's a sickling. The sandwiches have great flavors. It's a pretty healthy spot if that's what you're going for. I always get the pick 2, bread with Broccoli and Cheddar Soup. That soup is great, nice and thick and real creamy but, once it cools down, it tends to thin out and tends to not taste as yummy. My husband has the Turkey Sandwich, YUM! They use spicy greens so it adds a little more flavor than what you're expecting.

I see a lot of people coming here for business meetings and/or something like I do, a change of scenery from the coffee shops.

The staff is great. They're so nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast, I have always liked Panera, I think for a chain it's pretty good. I had a sausage egg and cheese in an everything bagel and it was very good. My husband just had a bagel and a cheese Danish and that was also good. 

Quick service, fresh food. Can't ask for more than that. Coffee is pretty decent too. Will be back for back for breakfast."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to the soup I had before at Panera's, but never got it. First of all, the woman taking my order could not understand anything I said and made me repeat all my information 3 times ( I speak clearly with no accent). When my meal arrived at my table (about 10 minutes after everyone else, I just ordered soup!), it was the wrong order. The server was polite and took the soup back, never to return. The manager was polite and apologized, but still charged me for my tea. I sat and waited for my food for 1/2 an hour, with no food, and they couldn't even give me a free drink. Everyone was very friendly and apologized, but with so many other good lunch places in the area, good service should be a priority. I won't return."}
{"text":"The experience at Panera has really gone down hill. The counter staff is so busy filling call-in orders they don't have time for customers. \"Go use the self-help order pad \" is not the way to great guests.  When I did finally get service, the hot toasted and buttered bagel came to the table cool and with packets of butter. Something so simple as a coffee and bagel order can certainly be handled better. I used to love this place. So sad the company expects iPads to replace a smiling face, welcome greeting and personal service first thing in the morning."}
{"text":"I was a regular when this was Paradise Bakery. The new decor is sleek and clean, and as far as I am concerned, much more comfortable. Not thrilled with the availability of plug ins for my laptop, or the fact that I had to crawl on the floor to plug it in once I found one. The food was the same as before. Loved the DIY kiosks. My issue is with service, which is not terribly friendly, and, based on previous reviews, can be awful. Figure it out, Panera."}
{"text":"So I've eaten at Panera Bread a few times over the years, and my final verdict is: This place sucks!

The food is bland! Even the coffee, with cream and sugar, bland!!!!! McDonald's coffee is better than their crap! The portions are tiny!!! My last visit, I ordered a breakfast sandwich and it was the tiniest thing ever! I ate it and was hungry again an hour later. And the pricing?!?! Don't even get me started!!!! $8 for a breakfast sandwich and coffee?!?!?! $15 for a skimpy sandwich and soup?!?! Get the eff out of here! 

Only reason this place gets 2 stars is because the employees are friendly and it's clean. Otherwise, I'll take my money and appetite somewhere else."}
{"text":"This was our Panera when I lived in Lake Wylie...like most Paneras, this one has the assortment that you would expect...and it is served well."}
{"text":"Clean facility, fairly new. Chains like this are really made by the people. I've found the staff pleasant and friendly, who accurately make my orders. It's not overly busy, even in the afternoons, and I haven't been made to wait too long for an order."}
{"text":"Oh Panera, what can I say--you provide some tasty morsels that get my sugar spiking first thing in the morning.  Your associates are always polished and professional (well except one time, but she was till waking up), your establishments are always clean, and you've never gotten my order wrong.  Good on you."}
{"text":"Dirty tables. Dirty floor. Average food. My husband asked our server to wipe our table. She did and wiped all the trash from the previous patrons in the floor.  We won't return to this location."}
{"text":"They basically threw my food together and didn't care I had a avocado peel still on my sandwich and was only a piece of avocado and the they just threw a broke up loaf of bread in my bag"}
{"text":"This place was formerly called Paradise Bakery, I'm not sure how changing names can make a difference, but after today, I probably will not go back,  It started out with the woman that waited on me.  She had no name tag, I def looked because I wanted to name her in this review.   I dont know if she was having a bad day or what, but she behaved like she hated her job and couldnt wait to get out of there.   I coudnt see the menu very easily so I asked her about the soups, she read them off so fast & so irritatingly that I didnt hear her. So I stopped & stared at the  menu until I could see it better. She sighed because I was taking too long (no one was behind me at the time) And def no smile or \"how can i help u\"   I stepped away after I ordered, I heard other people complaining about her behavior as well. I went to find my friend Fidella & I commented to her, \"wow, is she mad or what\" Fidella nodded & said OMG, lousy service from her. However, the girl that brought  me my bottled water was very nice.  The soup I ate was not good, I was very disappointed cuz In the past, their soups were always good.
I can handle a bad soup, I can order something else, but when I feel rushed & I dont even want to order because of a bad attitude, then I dont want to return. I ordered only soup because I didnt want to take too long to look at the menu because clearly the agent that helped me was very impatient with me."}
{"text":"Love love love their tomato soup and usually - everything else I order as well.
The new Spinach Power salad was just OK - weird dressing in my opinion. But this branch is as nice as the other ones, and the service was great."}
{"text":"I had a few hours to waste so I ended up here so I could enjoy some iced coffee while doing some work on my computer.  The iced coffee is pretty good here and I was impressed.  I like it more than the Starbuck's version.

I had my computer so I wanted to find a table with a accessible plug-in, but I tried two different areas and couldn't find any outlets.  What the heck? 

I did end up ordering lunch here too and that was just okay.  I had the Thai Chopped Chicken salad and just wasn't a huge fan of the dressing."}
{"text":"Salads are delicious, Tea is delicious, and they are pretty fast. 

I have also ordered their catering for work and I love how they give you large drink containers and EVERYTHING you need. It is unusual that you can get healthy food delivered, but Panera does it and does it well. 

Highly recommend it :-)"}
{"text":"The food is fine, in the way that most food from Panera is fine. But the service is incredibly slow. This evening I ordered a salad and a non-panini sandwich with no special instructions on either and the ticket time was 10 minutes. There were two orders ahead of mine that were already in process as I waited. And waited. And waited. While waiting, I couldn't help but notice how disgusting the food prep area was and that the order timer (displayed toward the customers) showed orders turning red after 3 minutes. I brought this to the attention of the manager who apologized but never seemed to register that there was a problem.

I strongly recommend ordering ahead rather than dropping by if you are expecting your fast casual to be anything close to fast."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying Panera. Ordered some take out and has a just okay experience. 

Staff goes out of their way to be polite. I was definitely impressed by their positive and helpful attitudes.

I ordered their take 2 with a Greek salad and tortellini Alfredo. When I ate it back at my office, I thought the packaging was quite cute. The salad was just okay... Needed a lot more dressing and some of the lettuce was starting to brown. Tortellini was good, cheesy and tasty but it could have used a little bit more sauce as it was a bit dry. The roll it came with was quite good. Fluffy and buttery... Didn't even need butter.

I thought it was kind of pricey for what it was... A small portion of pasta and an underdressed salad for almost $10. You can go to an Italian restaurant and get a lunch entree with larger portions for a cheaper price. 

But I will give Panera another try... Since their bread is so tasty I'll order a sandwich."}
{"text":"I would give this place more stars, but I didn't even get to eat my food. It sure did smell good though. My friend and I placed an order to go and we probably should have rechecked our order, but  we were in a hurry and wanted to eat our food on the way to our destination to save time. When we opened our bag there were no utensils and I ordered 2 sides of dinner rolls and they weren't in there either. By the time we got there we just threw our food away because there was no way to eat it."}
{"text":"Panera is similar to Paradise in the sense that the cookies look about the same, delivery of food can be very slow, and they now offer some kind of rewards program.  Cinnamon Crunch bagels run out early though, service is even less personal cuz instead of dealing with multiple stations you now use a computer if theres not a human available to take your order.  
Few if any GF options.  Gotta be creative here, or just go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am going to say this first --- if you're disappointed with your salad portions or your liquid frozen drink TAKE IT BACK AND HAVE IT REMADE.  Criminy, haven't any of you ever worked in food service?!  Okay, it is possible you have not but i can bet you eat out often enough and by now you should be able to approach the staff and ask for a fix or do over.  Did you make it all the way home and your order is wrong?  Then call them on it -you've got a receipt.  Majority of businesses will apologize AND they'll make it up to you with a credit or something.
So at least make the move, do something about it, and you might be surprised to find they improve in that area.
It just seems unfair to vent if you have just ONE less than ideal experience or if this is the first time you've dined at this location.  
And c'mon, the cookie is a Paradise thing.  Get over it.  Panera is Panera.  Panera is not Paradise, and thus the different name.
And I am gonna be honest with you here, Paradise is far from perfect.  Check out their reviews.
I'm a regular there.  HOMG, they are not generous with their meat portion on sandwiches...
  
I've been familiar with this place for a couple decades thanks to my sister.  Those Cinnamon Crunch bagels are phenomenal and honestly they're the real reason I even come here.  
Today I stopped in to get my son some breakfast after our regular morning of volunteering and enroute to a friends house.  Bagel for me and a Sausage, Egg and Cheese Panini for him.  It was good, just as I remember.  Bagel $1.34, cream cheese $1.25, sandwich $4.09 -doesn't look like a bad deal I suppose.
Decor is nice, classical and retro (40's jazz and big band) music playing quietly.  At this time of day its kinda quiet and not too busy.  I like the patio setup, but not sure how comfortable it is.  Really though most people just eat their food and leave so probably comfortable enough for that.  I can already visualize people pulling out computers/pads and parking their butt for hours inside at a corner booth.
And finally, there's a rewards card you can get that gives bonuses based on what you routinely order.
Overal this is a nice location for a quick breakfast, lunch or light dinner.  Guess I'll need to find a location closer to home for a nice change of routine."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for a while now and they keep getting worse. Started great I order online my food is ready when I get there and I'm back at the office in five minutes. Now it seems they have to forget one thing every time. I get a Mediterranean chicken salad with avocado. Lately they either forget that(which is extra$$) or something else. Even after the desk person asks the cook and he says \"yes I added it in\" it's missing. Today they tried to give me someone else's salad but I caught them and we switched it. So I get back to my desk and the avocado is rotten or been sitting our to long. Anyway if you can watch them make it oh should be fine but the rapid order is a roll of the dice that I mostly lose. I AM DONE!!!"}
{"text":"The manager at this facility is horrible! I wasn't offered a rewards card until I asked for it! The server already rang up my orders and wouldn't allow me to go back and register my rewards. I asked for help with the manager and she directed me to the website, when I put in the code from the receipt, it wouldn't allow me to enter it. I went back to the manager and she said 1 was already entered and the other you have to wait 6 hours in between purchases??!!!! What kind of crap is that?!!!  Won't be back!!!"}
{"text":"Used to love Panera have been a fan for somewhere around 15 years. The latest two experiences at this particular site are EXTREMELY disappointing and I am now no longer a fan nor will I eat here again. Ordered a half salad to go and got it home, opened the box it was. Half of s half salad. A ridiculous representation of what a customer should get for their money... almost $6.00 .. I received about a dollars worth of lettuce and some condiments and an 1/8 of an inch of dressing that didn't cover even the little salad I received.  This is the second time that this took place the first time I called and spoke with the manager who informed me that they were cracking down on the amount of portion that the customers were getting. I'm sorry but this is very disappointing and unacceptable. I would not recommend to any of my friends nor my family to eat at or from this restaurant. We find it unprofessional that the manager would tell me they're \"cracking down on the size of the portion the customers get.\" It's lettuce ...."}
{"text":"Pretty impressed to have a PB in Canada, the closest one for us is 45 min. across the border in Washington state.

Ironically, I'm glad to come here because you know for a major franchise, to expect cleanliness and a cozy atmosphere, almost like a super-sized version of a Bread Garden.  Right in the busy part of Yonge.

I came here a few times just for coffee/scones in the mornings on way to work, as they're close to the hotel, nothing special.  If I wanted pasta, I'd go to an Italian resto, and likewise for a sandwich, well same thing.

Liked the round booth seating in the back by the counter, the VIP spot."}
{"text":"Like the order on line option. Enjoy their salads. Good food. Good location. Clean. Comfortable. Good place to pick up a healthy dinner on the way home from work."}
{"text":"Pandora bread definitely has some delicious deli sandwiches usually go with a turkey & cheese sandwich with some lettuce tomatoes and onions. You can never go wrong with any of the salads neither bbq chicken salad to be specific. Service was great, staff was polite and quick with preparing my food before I knew it."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Panera and I have to say it was nothing special. My wife and daughter drove through and picked up lunch while they were running errands. I got the Roasted Turkey, Apple, and Cheddar sandwich as well as the 
Four Cheese Grilled Cheese sandwich so I could try both. They didn't have the Apple slaw for the Turkey sandwich so it was just turkey, cheese and a sad looking lettuce leaf. They should have at least discounted the price if they don't have all the ingredients. 

The Four Cheese grilled cheese was pathetic. I could throw a slice of cheese between two slices of bread and it would have been cheesier. 

I tried the Pecan Braid pastry and it was ok. 

So I guess if this is \"clean\" food, I'll stick to something a bit less sanitary, and satisfying."}
{"text":"Surly order takers that seem pissed that you are there; give a loud audible sigh when you ask is there a substitute for chips on my sandwich. While a manager with a scowl on her face oversees the whole process. Yeah that's an inviting experience.

Then you buzzer goes off and food that is haphazardly put together is slung into the window so your sandwich is flies apart. Once you reassemble the mess it tastes pretty good and they have good ice tea but its north worth the hassle and nasty attitudes of the employees there.

BTW, the internet was out that day and when I asked about it the response was \"It's working fine, you are probably not doing something right.\" Yup me and everyone else in the joint, back at our table I made a comment about the help and the person next to us agreed they also told me they have a constant problem with the internet in that store.

Skip this location - 1 star for the most atrocious and unfriendly attitudes I have had in a food service establishment in a long, long time."}
{"text":"I think I'm over Panera .. Paradise Bakery wasn't great either but this place is struggling. Simple bagel to-go order (sesame toasted bagel w plain cc, add tomatoes, sliced please) Uhhh nope .. Peep the photo; apparently u finish ur own bagel. Einsteins does it better n they're not even that good! Try n find a Brueggers or old school NY deli."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great place to grab a bite and study for school or catch up with friends. Love the smoothies and the baked goods."}
{"text":"Always held this place to high standards based on their reputation, but was so disappointed in my lunch. Ordered the soup and half sandwich. Soup was French Onion - first taste was out of a can. It had four cubes of bread and some inconspicuous traces of cheese under the broth. Half sandwich was the steak and white cheddar ... I was disgusted. I'm not the type to make a scene by returning it (let alone for a half sandwich), so I just threw it out. It was a microwaved piece of cheap meat that was so fatty and tough I couldn't get s full bite of bread, steak and cheese. Worse sandwich I've ever tasted. For $10 for a cup of soup and half a sandwich - not worth it at all."}
{"text":"This is probably the best panera I've been to! I did an online order and my iced coffee wasn't included in the order for some odd reason and they gave me one anyways. This location also has its green tea and lemonade next to the pop machine which I love! The food is delicious as always!"}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast and lunch. The food is good and service is friendly. Only complaint is the cashiers have a hard time with specialty coffee drinks above your generic coffee. On the plus side, they bring you food and drinks to your table and even offer pick up your mess when you are done."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, very health conscious food. And delicious. An absolutely great alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"The food was good but the portion side was ridiculous.  I choose the pick 2 and got 1 cup measured broccoli cheddar soup and the Italian which was 3 bites and cost $9.48.  Outrageous will never go again!"}
{"text":"Love the food- frontega chicken panini is my favorite.   And the tomato soup is a family favorite- we go out of our way for yummy tomato soup with crispy croutons.  
When I need a carb fix- this is my favorite place.    The seating is good,  just be sure to remember that around 3pm,  the school nearby let's out and the place becomes a bit loud and full with kids.  No adults so it's a little rambunctious - they come for the free wifi and maybe bagels."}
{"text":"Don't get the lentil bowl. Overpriced for mainly broth. It's not where's the beef, it's where's the lentils and quinoa !!!"}
{"text":"The best news you can get on a monday morning is finding out Panera delivers.  I work near Chandler mall and a few places delivery and you get sick of the same stuff. I decided to get the pick two and got the cream of chicken and chef goddess.  Amanda was very friendly and the app kept us updated on when food was going to arrive. The soup was hot and flavorful but the winner was the green goddess deessing. We ended up ordering twice that week"}
{"text":"Lady got our order wrong and when it finally came out I get cheese with bread .. I guess it was grill it yourself day .. $20 for 2 bowls of clam chowder and 1 \"cheese and bread\" (supposedly *Grilled cheese) never again"}
{"text":"There are a number of things that can be improved but I order online and pick up as much as possible from any and all Panera's. 

Just learned from ordering here that you can click slice and toast the bagel but they don't receive it written as such IF YOU DON'T ORDER cream cheese. 

Oh well. They will forget something but their good about taking ownership and fixing it.  

Plenty of parking. 
Later hours than Uptown.
Less traffic chaos than Providence. 
Convenient shopping center with Smoothie King, Publix, Walmart, Qdoba, Arby's. IHOP. O'Charley's nearby. Then local places like pho, dragon buffet, Lowe's. Cell phone store."}
{"text":"Really glad to see Panera make its way to Markham!  It's always busy whether it be opening week or any regular day. The reason? I think it's the food selection and the vibe. 

Choice of food include bagels, various kinds of breads, cookies, quiche, sandwhiches, soups, salads, coffee and tea, eurppean coffee drinks, smoothies, etc... I really like their muffies. The first time I had one was in their California location. and now whenever I go to any Panera, I always get a muffie, which is a soft muffin-top like cookie. It's now my thing. Their coffee drinks are pretty good, brewed coffee is self serve and it shows you the time on each roast so you know you're getting a fresh cup! 

Plenty of seating and lots of sunshine make this place ideal for catching up with friends or reading your textbook. But what really keeps people here is the free wireless internet. 

And remember to get the Panera card. You register online and every once in a while, they email you and let you know they loaded a \"surprise\" on your card that you can redeem in-store. With so many choices of food in our city, sometimes I like to switch it up, but then I get the email and I'm back to Panera again. They sure know how to get their customers to stay loyal! Nothing says \"we value you\" like free baked goods and coffee!"}
{"text":"Love it!..small gourmet proportioned sandwiches! Great place to also bring out the laptop and do some work. I usually get the Italian with chips and their special made ice teas. Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"We always wanted to try Panera Bread but maybe we picked the wrong one. Kind of dirty and really small portions. The parking lot was filthy. Not very impressive."}
{"text":"I kept wanting to like this place because I need to come for the convenience and  proximity. 
But there are several issues keep coming up: Wifi sucks: speed and consistency.
Coffee not always hot and fresh; 
Mostly: they mass up my orders, most times; when it's more than just a coffee and a cookie, it's beyond them: ordered 4 sandwiches, they made only three; their \"you pick two\", wow, either ordered you two full sets or give you 4 sets. So customers need to be always on alert. Overall, it's still a Panera, so still has all the goods associated with a Panera. Just sometimes not feeling very comfortable."}
{"text":"I love the food at Paradise Bakery.  It's fresh, and pretty consistant.  I like the choices they have for kids' meals, and the fact that they come with a yogurt.  The customer service at this location could use a little help.  I have had employees be smart/short/rude with me on most occasions.  Why do I put up with it?  The food is so good!  The salads are amazing, and they're huge.  If my family is really tired,and doesn't want to cook dinner but doesn't want \"fast\" food, this is our go to.  If you go in towards the end of their dinner rush, they are normally out of things.  One or two ingredients for your salad, or to-go containers.  Something.  As previous reviewers have mentioned, the ordering system is a little frustrating.  It's easier to navigate when it's not lunch hour.  This location is bananas from 11am-1pm.  I won't even go at that time anymore."}
{"text":"Nice place, but signage from the highway is sparse.  2nd turn of the exit itself, then first right, then down the road on the left."}
{"text":"I was sick so I ordered online and had my husband pick it up. Really fast service but by the time my grilled cheese got home, it was cold and had no cheese... :( not happy."}
{"text":"Panera has gone down IMHO. I did take out this week and was very disappointed. I ordered two varieties of chicken salad- Green Goddess Cobb with Chicken and Fuji Apple with Chicken. Neither of the salads  had a lot of chicken. It was quite pitiful. I had to go back to the counter and request extra portions on each one. The salads have gotten smaller and each had really mushy tomatoes. This is not the first time that I have had to request more chicken due to an inadequate helping on the salad. It feels like they are trying to cut corners. With the salads ranging about $9, I cannot pay that price just for lettuce. There needs to be some substance to the salad. I think some of the other fast food salads are equal to or better than these for less money.

Will be going elsewhere for entree salads in the future."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but I couldn't help but to bring to attention how gross this Panera is! Not only is the staff loud, obnoxious and unprofessional the entire place is disgusting. I don't know how they pass any heath inspections. Never going back to this location!"}
{"text":"I love panera but the last 2 times I ate here there was hair on my sandwich. So 2 for 2 I am no longer visiting this location."}
{"text":"Dropped in this place this morning....biggest mistake! Ordered Bacon/spinach soufflé and at 715 am they were out and I did not want to wait 20 mins for one do I asked for an Asiago BEC on white....got to work and my sandwich was Asiago steak egg cheese! Ugh! Had to wait and hour and a half to call the store because they don't turn their phones on until 9am. I was hung up on twice  and when I did get someone I was told the manager was busy. I plan to take this order back on my lunch and I will NEVER return! Absolute worst experience!"}
{"text":"I want to love you Panera... I work a few blocks away, I love your food, I love your rapid pick up... but you have to STOP with the soup samples. I've had to walk out twice because the cashier offered the person ahead of me a sample of soup to help them make their decision. First, it's gross. I have to stand there and listen to some moron slurp and smack on their soup samples while I stand and wait to place my order. Second, it takes forever! There's only one cashier and the process seems to take about 5 minutes which is an eternity when you are waiting in line. And did I mention it's gross? Seriously- please stop offering random people soup. It's extremely aggravating to the rest of us."}
{"text":"On business travel. Passed Panera Bread on my way to an appointment. Ordered the egg white, avocado,and spinach sandwich. Restaurant clean (including bathrooms). Friendly staff. Music faint not loud; I can still think. Food was good not frozen and reheated. One customer complained about his food. The manager without question apologize. Prepared another order for him. And refunded his money. True customer service."}
{"text":"Bad.  Really bad.  Not sure how a chain can be this bad, clearly the staff and management are not following the corporate guidelines.  Every time I go in here it seems that I enter a universe where time seems to stand still, it just takes forever.  If I had only a few minutes to live, I would want to go to this Panera because it would feel like an eternity.

Normally the experience is this:  walk in, typically a line - one person working the register who appears to be lost or in some sort of trance.  Order taken, typically there is some sort of mistake or just lack of intelligence to actually comprehend the order to fulfillment.  Like ordering a bagel to go, and the order taker doesn't realize she needs to actually get the bagel.    If I get a sandwich - which I don't anymore after finding hairs in my last one, it is typically a mixed bag, usually watching a crew of teenagers using the n-word to describe their bro's, joking around and generally being rude and oblivious to the fact that most people don't like to be around people who talk and act like that.

Overall this is the worst panera - ever.  I doubt it will last with all the other wonderful cafe's and lunch places.  Or it will thrive with the suburban crowd passing through or college kids that don't know of all the better places to eat in the heights."}
{"text":"Love this Panera, they're always so quick to get peoples' orders and serve them. The only nuisance here is this man that is alllllllllwaaaaaays here. He sits in the back and huffs and puffs when people are talking too loud or laughing. Um, this is a public place and anyone is allowed to come here and talk and eat. If you want quiet and free wifi GO TO THE LIBRARY."}
{"text":"I remembered at one point when Panera first opened, their food was less airplane-ish and out of a box.  Now their food just tastes blah.  I guess I wouldn't get anything that has meat in it because their chicken tastes like it was soaked in preservatives for a while.  Their food was not entirely fresh.  

Service was actually quite good and because I had so many orders, the kind lady even offered me a ginormous bag.  

If you're looking to grab something quick and easy, that's the only time I'd go here."}
{"text":"Best soup and tea & pasta salad! Very nice employees and always clean when I have been in there and the kids love the cookies!"}
{"text":"The most disorganized Panera Bread I've ever been to.  I went back and forth with the cashier with her trying to tell me that the flatbread I wanted was not actually in the flatbread category.  It was like we were speaking a different language.  I had to point to the board and walk her through line by line to explain why I was right (or at least why the board was wrong).  That would be all fine and dandy if she didn't have an attitude about it, as if I was a crazy person.  Terrible customer service.

Food was okay.  I was very disappointed with the Cesar salad which came with a glob of dressing in the middle, not tossed at all.  Gross in appearance.  They did not bring us the right silverware or butter for the bread, requiring two separate trips up to the counter to ask for these missing items.

It was chaotic to say the least.  Certainly not what I'm used to from this chain."}
{"text":"Salad smelled bad and was just a handful of lettuce but cost almost $10. Incredibly disappointing. Panera's has changed for the worse. It used to serve bigger salads that didn't literally smell like trash for the same price. 
Also Came here for a coffee and waited 30 min just to get a paper cup to serve myself coffee instantly."}
{"text":"The good - The meal was good, the service was pretty fast.
The bad - most of the empty tables were dirty or were never cleaned well after the previous customers had left. And the apple that came as a side with one of the orders had seen better days."}
{"text":"My husband and I have a standing Saturday morning date at Panera. It's a great place to sit awhile and catch up with each other after a busy week.  Great coffee and good food."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Panera location. I have had the broccoli cheddar soup and it is phenomenal. Also, the chicken chipotle avacado melt is to die for. The fruits are always fresh, and our food is ready fast and accurately every time!"}
{"text":"Despite the fact that 9 out of 10 times they get my order wrong, I'm still a fan of this Panera. The staff are kind, the tables are always clean, and the food quality is usually super fresh.

During lunchtime, this place is packed and can be relatively difficult to find seating so beware!"}
{"text":"So yummy and fast. The staff is always super nice here. Great lunch spot when you don't have a lot of time. I definitely recommend the bacon bravo and broccoli cheddar soup!"}
{"text":"The food is pricey but the reward program is ridiculously good. Sometimes you get a month with free coffee or a free bagel every day!

This location has always had food that I have enjoyed, no issues, but I took a star off for the drive thru experience which is inconsistent. This is part of a big US chain.

My favourite things here:
Steel cut oats with Apple cinnamon or with strawberries and pecans. Delicious, filling and nutritious.
Breakfast parfait - small but so good
Cinnamon crunch bagel is a decadent treat. The top carmelizes when toasted.
Pick two lunch - soup (tomato or squash) and salad (Fuji Apple) are my favourite. I usually get the Apple as my side, although the baguette option is good too
Coffee - I really like their hazelnut coffee. Mmm.

Washrooms and tables have been clean at every visit. Service is generally warm and friendly."}
{"text":"The Pesto tortellini was so super yummy. I love that they have healthy options as well. I really go to Panera bread for the dark roast coffee though. They make it fresh and perfect every time."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, i can in a couple minutes before the place closed and they were all happy to assist me with my order and didn't seemed rushed or unhappy with my visit. I love the soup and well most definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Everything was awesome except the tomatoes, today they were old and gross, but I still love this place! Turkey BLT with basil is the only way to go! Also sub spinach in the Greek salad is definitely worth it!! The ginger peach tea is on point"}
{"text":"I see that my two star review isn't really going to make a difference amongst the sea of bad reviews. It's a shame that I feel Panera can't quite live up to the PB that was once in this location. Apparently the \"special instructions\" button doesn't work and when you inform them of said special instructions they don't get it and then make sure to point out that it doesn't actually work so it's a complete waste of time even trying to type something in. Whatever, the food is worth going!! Love it every time! Spot on Panera! Your customer service just blows."}
{"text":"The employees like to argue with each other in front of every one causing long lines and messed up orders constantly. I work nearby and it sucks I can't come here to enjoy my break anymore because my order is either always incorrect, takes forever, or the employees are rude. I have second hand embarrassment for the people who work here and fight in front of customers, it's extremely unprofessional."}
{"text":"Service is usually good. Their salads are my favorite! Nice to come here if you want a quiet lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Used the rapid pick up online for the first time and had an incredible experience with Deborah the manager. I made a mistake and she fixed it right away. Love love love the food here and will be back! Try the rapid fire online ordering as it is a great experience!"}
{"text":"Very simple order bowl of soup with a baguette, they forgot the baguette. I'm not sure how they can't remember that baguette goes with soup since it's one of their most basic combinations. Lol."}
{"text":"Not all Panera were created equal... This location has the worse service!! Careless, rude, uneducated personnel.  Salad dressings water down! No comparison with Panera on Rancho and Sahara, were service is amazing and courteous. The food is yummy and fresher. If you want to be frustrated and mistreated, go ahead and visit this Panera location. Yikes..."}
{"text":"this panera sucks ass. i normally love panera, especially the grilled cheese but not the four cheese one because that's too much for me but anyways we show up at 9:15 and there doors to the store are locked already. bitch they close at 10 the fuck. so we call the store and no one answers the phone so we r just standing outside lookin stupid. eventually some lady comes out and is like bahahahah lol we locked the doors! so she lets us in and we ordered food to go. we have been sitting here for like 10 mins now and they are taking five years to make it. when i was going to get my drink they were out of cups it was just bad. the only reason why they got one star instead of 0 is because when I peed i noticed the toilets were eco friendly. don't come here unless ur gonna shit and go."}
{"text":"So I'm not quite sure if Panera is a national phenomenon yet, but it should be. One challenge of moving to the Charlotte area from the Northeast has been to try to recognize what's a chain and what's not, or which restaurants are Charlotte originals or more regionals chains. 

In any event, Panera is a lot like Au Bon Pain, for those familiar with that restaurant, but this location at least is a lot bigger. It's huge, which made for a pretty efficient ordering process when I was in there recently during the lunch crunch. That's huge in city with so many people leaving their offices to descend on the same few lunch places. I liked that about Panera--and it's super clean and well-run, too. 

As for the food, I was very pleased. Try the Chicken Caesar sandwich--it's huge and was really fresh. The bread, obviously, was amazing, hence the name of the place. And all of it was very affordable too."}
{"text":"I love Panera and this is my go-to location when I'm able to take a lunch off-campus. I've always experienced great customer service here and my food is on-point - seriously can't get enough of the Green Goddess salad.

The restaurant is well-maintained and tables are typically clean of crumbs/dishes, which is highly appreciated as I expect this particular location likely gets a high volume of traffic. My one complaint is the parking lot. There's a handful of spaces in front of the restaurant, otherwise you have to try to squeeze your car into the smaller-than-normal spaces in the back lot. I always fear for my car's life when I park it there but (knocking on wood) haven't had a real problem yet."}
{"text":"I've been to many different Panera's before but I was especially impressed with the attention to detail at this location. I ordered the you-pick-two option with many customizations (ie Thai Chicken Salad with no dressing, peanut sauce on the side, no crispy wontons) and they got everything right. The service was quick and very friendly. 

In regards to the food itself, I wasn't overly impressed. There was barely any chicken on my Thai chicken salad and the pita for my Mediterranean Chicken Pita didn't taste fresh. The toffee cookie, however, tasted like it had just come out of the oven."}
{"text":"I stopped at this Panera to dine-in while I was shopping at the South Park Mall, and it was pretty much your standard Panera experience.

This Panera is conveniently located inside the South Park Mall, and I lvoe the layout of the restaurant. There are windows so you can see out into the mall, and there are even tables outside the restaurant entrance so you can sit in the mall if you want to. It wasn't real busy when I came in, but service took a while. The food was pretty good. I honestly think Panera is a bit overpriced for what you get. The restaurant was clean. The biggest issue was that some workers seemed confused and disorganized, which is probably why the food seemed to take longer than it should have.

Overall, I would recommend this place as a good option when it comes to food and dining at the South Park Mall."}
{"text":"Service at the Monroeville, PA Panera in the Miracle Mile Plaza was less than admirable. First, my fiancé and I ordered a Frontega Chicken sandwich with a grain roll and a cup of broccoli cheddar soup w the same grain roll. She ordered a You Pick 2: half Bacon Turkey Bravo and half chicken hummus bowl. It took fifteen minutes for our food to come out, and here is why... First, a server came to us and told us that they were out of the breads for both sandwiches. When asking what the substitutes were, the server blankly stared at us. A simple \"let me check\" would've sufficed. We got up, which was fine, and went to talk to the sandwich maker. Then, about three minutes later, a different server came by and said, \"we're out of chicken.\" It's dinner rush on a Friday, and you're out of two signature types of bread and chicken. That's crazy! I asked for a refund, and he stammered that it'll be five minutes, as they are cutting and portioning it. Do you have it or don't you? Can't you just make one portion and make the sandwich? I'm confused. My fiancé's You Pick 2 and my soup came out. My soup with the incorrect baguette. When I asked the server, he gladly brought me a whole wheat one, but he removed the French baguette from my plate with the napkin with which he brought the wheat one. Was he going to reuse that baguette? I didn't see him throw it away in the next-to-us trash can. My soup tasted watered down, and to top it off, my freshly cut and portioned chicken was cold in my sandwich. Overall, it was a frustrating 40-minute experience. I have been going to Panera for 10 years and even worked at one in college for a while, and I never have had such poor service."}
{"text":"Extremely upset. I went in there with my sister after our workout and were extremely hungry. Placed our order and sat down we noticed it was pretty busy. We waited 50 minutes for our 2 salads then after coming home I realized their was no chicken on my salad as I ordered. I double checked my receipt to make sure the cashier put it in correctly. I was definitely charged for it but did not receive any. Already aggravated we waited almost an hour for 2 salads and it coming out incorrect. I called the number on the recipe and there was no answer each time. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here to have some soup- as always, paying almost 6$ for the large bowl and they couldn't even fill the bowl to at least HALF way."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm overly excited because since we moved to AZ we've missed Panera.  The service is awesome and the food is fresh and tasty.  I've never passed an employee that didn't smile back.  I love this place, and this location in particular."}
{"text":"Got home with my online pick:up order at Panera metro center. I love this place and so do my kids. We spent $45 there tonight and I got the my favorite go-to... Thai salad with chicken. Unfortunately they left out the peanut sauce which is an essential ingredient that really makes this dish.. so it just wasn't the same and very dry. I was also surprised as it was my first time ever walking into a Panera and they did not have chocolate chip cookies. What is worse, While we were waiting on the pick up bench outside kitchen pickup window, there were three or four female employees all gossiping and talking loud. When They saw us there they finally realized our order and started making it. We waited about 15 minutes although we had called it in 45 minutes prior. I love this place ...maybe it was just a bad night."}
{"text":"OMG !!! DISGUSTING! Our food was all wrong then as we were sitting and watching a customer was standing at the counter with his Dog who was not a service animal and the dog was licking the counter. GROSS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ryan was the only name I got but the service was horrible we weren't engaged as guest my girlfriend asked what should she get seeing how it was out first time. Our question was totally ignored and we weren't asked if it was to go or were we gonna stay so naturally they assumed we were dining in when I corrected the mistake it took like 10 minutes to finally bring our bagged stuff. A mess was spilled and none of the necessary procedures was followed to assure guest safety. Safety Rangers where are you? I also ordered bread for the side and got chips. So for my first time I will not be coming back to this location I will try another one and I only hope that they get the customer service skills up. If your coming here turn around and go home it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Gosh this place is going downhill, fast. Each time I visit, the wait is a little longer, the floors are a little stickier, the booths/chairs a little more run down, and the bathrooms a lot stinkier. (Seriously, today the bathrooms were so unbearable I walked back to Salsaritas to wash my hands.) And, don't even get me started about the parking situation! 

The food is so uniform and hard to screw up, it keeps me coming back. If I'm in a rush and want something relatively healthy, I'll stop by for a half salad and cup of soup. But, I swear, each visit lately makes me question why I come back. A few more gross visits like the recent ones and I may just start leaving the house earlier to give myself extra time to eat at Namastay (just behind Panera) instead."}
{"text":"They forgot to put chicken on my Southwest Chili Lime Ranch with Chicken salad, I mean come on how do you forget one of the ingredients in the title of the salad?!"}
{"text":"I'm more of an indie-coffee shop kind of guy, but I actually like Panera Bread. Having been to a couple of them in Florida, I knew what to expect. This location is quite spacious with a large second floor, which has been fairly quiet on my two visits. 

The food is decent, particularly the salads I think.  I like the avocado cobb, which comes with chicken, bacon, avocado, blue cheese, etc, etc.  It's huge, quite filling, and comes with a piece of baquette or chips or apple. It's just over $10 plus tax, but is a good lunch. The sweets are of course mass produced, but I quite like the cinnamon chip scones."}
{"text":"I went in last minute to grab some delicious mac and cheese. I kept apologizing for coming in so close to closing. The staff was super nice to me and letting me know it was okay."}
{"text":"They have a  touchscreen ordering system that was a little frustrating since almost every selected group screen was out of something. Luckily the human ordering cashier line was open. Spoke my order, paid and got what I wanted.

Got the bowl of chili which was a thick soupy chili filled with a variety of beans, meat and corn. It had a warmth to it. The half turkey sandwich appeared small but was filling enough. Bagels and cookies looked fresh."}
{"text":"NOM NOM!! I like the food. I like the service! Come here if you're looking for a light lunch. :)"}
{"text":"I love the service. I love the food!! The only bad thing is deciding what the heck to eat. I had their turkey avocado BLT sandwich and it was a gooder!! Their coffee is excellent. I've had their iced coffee and a latte. It's a clean and family friendly environment. Excellent quality food and quite healthy too! WOOT!!"}
{"text":"Had an egg, bacon and cheese breakfast sandwich this morning at Sky Harbor next to gate  C17.  TERRIBLE. After waiting 15 minutes it was small, cold and disgusting. The egg was stone cold and cooked sunnyside up. It had sticky  yolk dripping down the sides of the cold, hockey puck sized bun.  The cheese was also cold and not melted. I threw it out. Not going for this 6 dollar experience again. I expected so much more from this chain."}
{"text":"Went here to grab some coffee. The half & half bottle was empty. So I took it to the cashier and I was told she can't do anything because she is on the register. She didn't even try to get any help for me. Which is not acceptable. And she looked annoyed because I ask her for some half & half. 

Finally I guess some one from the back noticed how I was being treated and she rushed to help me get some half and half. 

Telling customers that they can't help or can't be bothered for something is NOT ACCEPTABLE."}
{"text":"There is a certain male who takes your order at the drive-thru who is extremely rude. He gives attitude to the customers and has on MULTIPLE occasions, which is odd considering we're his paycheck, but not anymore! My business will not be going towards this company anymore, considering i've called and complained and there have been no improvements. He seems like he doesn't want to be working there, and he probably shouldn't! With a negative attitude like that he should not be dealing with customers face to face."}
{"text":"Back to Wildflower for me.  The flat bread is flat for a reason at Panera, hardly anything  in it... soup was goopy and way too thick.  This along with a drink, $11.00 or so.. I think not,  I  took about 5 bits of each and left rest on table... Never going back again."}
{"text":"Everyone knows what to expect from panera but I love their online ordering and catering service. Makes lunch quick and easy. I would suggest if going there try their service out. Also the southwestern soup is great!"}
{"text":"Didn't know this Paradise Bakery was changed to Panera. I knew they had merged. PB was still at Fashion Square a month ago.
I had their Italian Combo which had too much bread and the meat didn't cover all the bread. It came with a pickle and bag of chips. I should have gone to Jimmy John's for a much better sandwich.
My wife had the Chicken Walnut sandwich and it was skimpy on the chicken walnut. That sandwich was definitely an 'F'.
Thought Panera was a better company but it fell way short of Paradise Bakery standards.
The staff took their time clearing the tables and the floors needed to be swept or vacuumed.
Panera wants you to me a rewards member by offering 30 days of FREE coffee, tea or soda.
Don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"This panera has to wait with the buzzer for your food. I do t mind that, but what is the point of the tip thing then? There are always plenty of places to sit, the dining area is more open then some others. The food is the same as others, however the customer service and couth the staff has is at a higher standard, i like that. It's clean. No employees were seen jumping up onto a counter here. It's a go for me."}
{"text":"I have been to this Panera quite a few times. The food is just the same as other Panera's, however the staff (most of the time) and location is better then others. They ask you if you would like to tip on the keypad now. I don't mind tipping the dollar since they bring the food to you. I also ask for extra sauce over the counter sometimes and they never hesitate to \"fork\" it over. 
The three stars is not because of the food or service. It is not because of the cleanliness in the dining area. The three stars is for the bathroom cleanliness and me witnessing something that just appalled me. A couple visits ago, a staff member told another staff member that something was wrong on the menu up on the wall. The staff member then got up on the counter and stood on it to fix whatever was wrong. The staff member then proceeded to carry on with their work, however didn't even sanitize the counter they just put their dirty shoes on. They should NOT be climbing and standing on the counter spaces to do anything! Very disgusting. Also dangerous. I'm sure OSHA would not approve. 
The three stars, to me, is being generous, simply because the staff is generally very nice and helpful and the dining area is well kept."}
{"text":"I honestly never understood what was so great about Panera until I tried their bagels. 
Wow. Way better bagels than anywhere else I've had them. Starbucks, giant eagle, Dunkin' Donuts, they can't touch Panera. 
I went inside this one today, I really like it, it was clean , maybe a little outdated style-wise, but comfortable. The staff seemed a bit shy? Maybe even understaffed, or maybe too chatty. It's hard to say but they weren't the best staff to ever help me with something. However, I'm still pleased, and I will be frequenting this location more often."}
{"text":"They mess up orders all the time! Especially when going through the drive-thru. I also ordered an egg and cheese sandwich and when I got to work to eat it there was no egg on it. Pure laziness at this store."}
{"text":"Horrible service, placed a breakfast catering order, when I asked for plates, I was given an eye roll and was told they weren't sure if they could give me plates. Had a bunch of bags to carry out to my car, they weren't busy and no one offered to help carry bags to my car. I've never been to a Panera with that horrible of service before.  They weren't teenagers, all were grown women. 

The bagels and pastry ring were good, but I won't be using them for catering esp for work functions. I would get fired it I acted like any of those women."}
{"text":"I used to love this location so much that I've contacted the company to compliment the service. However it's has gone extremely downhill. The last 3 times I've been here the whole place is filthy. The tables are always dirty. The walls and trash area always have food stuck there for God knows how long. The employees are all incompetent. I never get utensils but the last time I asked for them to be brought to me I got up because it was taking so long and found the employee who was bringing them dumping plates in the trash can whole holding my clean silverware. Sad that this place is no longer what it used to be."}
{"text":"Staff is always very nice and helpful, clean restaurant. It's a great experience every time I come here, even in the middle of lunch rush."}
{"text":"FOR ALL LOCATIONS:

Love the atmosphere, but I HATE the food at Panera. I feel like something is always missing.....salt.....pepper.....mayo...flavor...Anywho. My fiance likes the pastry. I enjoy using the wifi and having meetings with my clients. Also it's quite during the week (late afternoon)

Thats all"}
{"text":"Very good experience...
Had a reward for a $2 off broth bowl so that is what I ordered,  Shirley the cashier was very friendly.  After paying and sitting down to wait for my food, I realized the $2 had not been taken off.  The really sweet deliverer got me a manager and they gave me back the $2 (with tax), and I still have the reward!!  I can't wait until the summer salads come out, love the strawberry poppyseed salad.."}
{"text":"Poor customer service:( shift manager Shane Davis completely ignored me! He would rather take a phone call than to take my order. When he was done making a shake and taking the phone call, he proceeded to the back of the kitchen-- not even acknowledging my presence! He didn't even say someone else would help me. He didn't even smile.. He looks like he is completely unhappy here. Sad....Makes it difficult to come back, with people like him as a manager.. Lead my example! Food was okay"}
{"text":"Will never go to this location again.  Ordered food to go, got home and 3 out of 4 items were incorrect - not slightly, entirely different items.  When I called, the person who answered the phone was very rude and just passed the phone to someone else.  When I spoke to a manager, there was no apology, just an exasperated effort to take my number and offer me a free half sandwich if I come back within 30 days.  If they can't get the food right that I paid for, I don't think I'll be stopping in for free stuff."}
{"text":"I was at The District shopping, it was time for lunch, I was starving, and I remembered that I had a Panera gift card in my car. So I stopped in to grab lunch to take home. 

My order was taken quickly and only took a few minutes to be prepared. Everything was packed up well with plenty of napkins and silverware. I love the Pick Two option at Panera and opted for that. My husband and I both had a salad and the Turkey Avocado BLT. Meh. Both of us remembered Panera being a little bit better and weren't wowed by our food. Neither of us desired to eat all of our food. I do appreciate that I can get a meal that includes vegetables on the go though. It's also great that Panera posts calorie counts on the menu board to help make better choices. 

Overall, not my first pick, but this can be a healthier fast food option at a reasonable price. I wouldn't hesitate to return if I find myself with a gift card again."}
{"text":"I've been to this Panera location more times than I can count. It has always been a decent, inexpensive option for lunch, dinner, or a good breakfast pastry. Many fond memories of coffee and pastry with my mom when I would make visits home from college. 

My favorite breakfast treats are the Chai Tea Latte and the Egg Souffles. The Pick 2 lunches and dinners are great. Pretty much every salad, sandwich, and soup is delicious. I love that Panera posts calories on their ordering board so you can quickly tally your meal as you wait to order.

The dining area is always clean with tables ready for dining. The employees also make rounds during busy times to take dirty dishes. If they don't make it your way then you'll bus yourself at the end. Employees are usually friendly and prepare orders correctly. I have noticed over the years that they do hire many teenagers and sometimes they can be a little awkward with service. We were all teenagers working at a first job at one point so it has never bothered me."}
{"text":"French onion soup and steak panini sandwich was ok. There are better places for less the price."}
{"text":"Eating a low carb diet is hard. Eating out while on a low carb diet is even harder. Finding something that isn't a salad on the fly can be nearly impossible.

This review isn't so much about the food, but the excellent customer service I received this past Friday. I wish I remembered their names, one was a new assistant manager I believe and the other I think was the manager. 

I heard about some \"secret menu\" that wasn't actually secret because apparently Panera released it publicly, and it had an option for two eggs, steak, avocado  and tomatoes - perfect for my diet! 

Sadly, I guess this menu was just recently discontinued. I explained to the managers that I needed something (anything) low carb, and they wound up rigging another menu item (I think a steak egg and cheese sandwich) to be sans bread, add avocado and tomatoes so I still got exactly what I hoped for. It's not often you get that kind of service from a chain. 

And of course, their coffee is fantastic too."}
{"text":"Not really impressed, hit the drive through  yesterday and it was just ok.  I had the chipotle chicken avocado melt. Was a lot smaller then i though it would be.  For 10 bucks i expect to be filled up.    And it did not taste that great.    And way over priced  for 2 sandwich and a cup of soup it was 25 bucks.  No drinks. We took it home to eat.     I will not be back."}
{"text":"Freshness and quality topnotch, best coffee and sandwich in the area"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites to come to. The food always seems to be fresh and made relatively quickly. One of their best sandwiches is the Chipotle chicken panini, I seem to keep coming back to it. 

The atmosphere is always quiet, clean and pleasant. Always recommend for a work or intimate outing."}
{"text":"Yeah Panera bread here is always behind. They don't care about how long you wait or if your order is correct. There should not be an online order option if you cannot even fill the order on time. It says pick up asap 5-10 minutes. Then our order took 40 minutes and everything came out at different times at the wrong temperature. Save your money and find something better. Starbucks is next door."}
{"text":"I was unhappy with this place and will avoid going there again.  It is very annoying when you are hungry and pay $13 and still remain hungry. Panera bread looks delightful from the outside! Looks can be deceiving. Upon ordering a meal that consisted of a sandwich, soup, chips and a drink one can safely assume that they will be full. 

Once the order arrived: it was half a sandwich, apparently thats what a $13 combo gets you! The small sandwich was sub par with toasted bread, turkey slices, cheese and a house sauce. Then came the watered down chicken noodle soup, which lacked chicken or any other hearty ingredients. The bag of baked chips were good in comparison, clearly it was not manufactured by Panera otherwise there would be 5 chips in the bag. Also the drink was missing. 

I have paid $7 dollars for small sandwiches, with quality ingredients that justify the price, but this place provides a snack masked as a meal."}
{"text":"Fabulous breads make wonderful sandwiches. Great soup. My wife is not a fan of their salads. An American chain that is first rate in service and food stuffs. Free trade tastes great. And great bang for the buck. Makes Etobicoke almost tolerable."}
{"text":"It seems silly to rate a chain so I won't talk about the food. 

I just love coming to this Panera because it's right by Barnes and Noble.  I recently started getting into the Panera card. Compared to the other Paneras I have to say that this one seems cleaner, bigger, and all around nicer.  Of course I would never go out of my way to get here but if you're at Barnes and Noble and aren't happy with the sandwiches there (which I was) I would venture on over to Panera."}
{"text":"I love panera but this one is TERRIBLE. I am not one to actually send in a complaint but I have for this place!! The food was cold and gross, the workers were swearing across the restaurant, they never called my name so the food just sat until I had to go up there and ask, and then they were like Oh yeah it's just been sitting here! UH? And there breakfast is pretty good, so I've gone back a few times but they keep messing up my order!! So yeah I'm never going back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible customer service. My husband and I ordered food to go and arrived home to discover several of our ordered items were missing. I called and spoke with Lauren the manager. She showed no concern for the inconvenience of us having to drive all the way back in order to obtain our correct order. Further, she offered no compensation for the inconvenience. Then to add insult to injury, we get our order corrected and return home once again, only to discover the lettuce in our salads were wilted....brown and gross!!! This has been the worse Panera Bread experience ever and we shall not return to this location."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, but POOR customer service.  No smiles on the cashiers at all.  They just never seem happy to be there."}
{"text":"Wow!!! This place has gone down hill in a big way.. the dinning room smells bad and is always dirty.. the food is sloppy and sometimes not fit to eat.. very disappointing.. there's a guy at the drive thru that is creepy and extremely RUDE!!!! Will never go back.. OVER priced!!!"}
{"text":"Very rude cashier. Saw her yelling at a Hispanic couple who didn't understand her.  Not very welcoming to us either. Really seemed like she didn't want to be there. (Sunday 11/19 1015am)"}
{"text":"Pricey alternative but good alternatives - This Panera bread is pretty busy with friendly staff who will kindly help with the ordering process.  

I especially like that what I ate was very filling and nutritious."}
{"text":"While I have yet to eat here, since this is just my AM coffee stop (if I have time) on the way to work, I have been impressed each and every time I have visited by the demeanor of the staff. Panera is not typically a place (in my experience) that you find an always cheerful, friendly, and helpful staff, but at this particular location, I have only had the most positive interactions. Even this morning when the line was about 7 people deep, the cashiers remained calm and friendly and took an appropriate amount of time with each guest depending on what he or she was ordering. I know my order is always simple (medium coffee to go-LOVE the Hazelnut), but I just wanted to give a kudos to the staff for always handing me my cup with a smile on their face, which is nice to see when I'm still half-asleep in the morning!"}
{"text":"I tend to frequent Panera after a solo trip to the mall as I did this past Saturday. I arrived around 2pm, and although it was past the lunch hour it was very crowded. I walked right up to the register though because several parties in front of me were not ready yet. I always get a \"You pick 2\" and I always get a cup of the chicken noodle soup and, lately, the turkey cranberry flatbread. The soup is always great, while the flavors are present in the flatbread but since they microwave it, it tastes more like one of those lean cuisine panini sandwiches than something made fresh. I like how Panera readily advertises the calorie content of all their foods. I believe this is what always prompts me to get the flatbread even though I want the Sierra Turkey sandwich. Also, I LOVE their hazelnut coffee in the morning. Their breakfast sandwiches are ok but not as good in my opinion as Brueggers or Einsteins bagels, both of which are closer to me in the AM than Panera."}
{"text":"This is a typical Panera and run very well. I am not a terrific fan of the menu but what I do get is always very good. Staff seems to be well trained."}
{"text":"overpriced, small portions, slow service (even when it WASN'T one of those crazy, line-out-the-door days)...you are in central phoenix, please go to any of the myriad local shops instead. at the very least you will get more for your money. sometimes more for LESS money."}
{"text":"I've never felt sicker than I do right now. While my experience wasn't bad... everyone was nice and everything, I feel terrible after eating here. 

We ate lunch here today, a group from work, and I ordered the Autumn Squash soup with White Cheddar Steak Panini. The panini was super greasy and the first half of the sandwich was all onions. The Autumn Squash soup was good, but too sweet... it tasted like they just dumped sugar in it. I also had the green tea, that was okay, but also very sweet. I didn't even finish my meal."}
{"text":"Not much to say I've been here a lot as it's on my way home from work and it's always high prices, dirty dining room and the food is lackluster. I posted a picture of an avocado that was on my sandwich which is unacceptable especially considering the prices."}
{"text":"I like Panera, but this is the filthiest Panera I have ever been to, when I travel for work I usually hit Panera for breakfast so I've probably been to 15 deferent locations this year some in airports..... Even they wipe their tables, however this one in my home town has filth cakes everywhere"}
{"text":"I went to Panera to give it a try. I will say employees were nice but.... I hate the fact that it is overpriced and the sandwich I got was okay the soup was delish. I was very dissapointed they did not give a dam cookie with the meal like really !!!!! I wish paradise was back."}
{"text":"There's a lot of negative reviews but I've never really had any issues with food or service at this Panera location. I love Panera in general for their fresh salads and yummy pastries. It's a nice stop for a quick meal or grab and go. Perfect environment for studying or just a chat with some friends. The Kale Chicken Caesar is amazing! I also think their chocolate chip cookies are some of the best. I usually go with a \"You Pick Two\" and get a salad and half sandwich.  I've never had any of their soups which, to be honest, I've not heard anything good about.

The only slight negative experience was once when I ordered a salad to go they mistakenly put it in a \"for here\" bowl. When I told them they took it back and began making another one. I said I was fine with them just putting the already made salad in a box. But they said they had to toss it and make another one. I mean, this didn't really affect me aside from the extra minute to make it, but it was pretty wasteful.

Despite this, I definitely frequent Panera when I'm in need of a quick, not so heavy, bite."}
{"text":"Bagel was warm but a little hard.. And I asked the girl to warm up my daughters cinnamon roll since it was a little cold but I guess she didn't hear me.. Ohh well only thing we really enjoyed was the green tea"}
{"text":"Went in to order a single loaf of bread. Thr cashier wasn't able to slice the bread for me - that's fine, someone else here can. Apparently not, I was told that they have presliced loaves for making sandwiches and that they'll just give me one of those - okay, I'd rather have the loaf on the shelf I can watch them slice, but fine.

The loaf is thin sliced, and I want it thick sliced. Their response is to assure me that the bread slicers only do thin. I responded with no, I watched someone last time I ordered a loaf slice it thick. 

Someone who has actually been trained to use the machine (shouldn't all of age employees be able to use this??) slices the bread for me, then disappears to the back with it. I assume he's just bagging it for me. 

He is not, in fact. I am told that he took a slice to make a half sandwich, and is this okay? Um NO I paid for the whole loaf, not for someone else's sandwich... I express this, and the man helping me rolls his eyes and walks to the back and returns with the bread I have already paid for, with two slices cut in half!

A 15 minute ordeal for a single, thick sliced loaf of sourdough that had been molested. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"This place is good. The app is really convenient. I pretty much like all their sandwiches and salads. I don't fuck with soup like that, but I'm sure it's soupy."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO!!!! I had food poisoning!!! I ordered the tomato and mazzerella panini and med sandwich, threw up everything a few hours later and was sick the whole next day, couldn't go to class. 

One Panera has made me avoid all paneras now :/"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the order has been wrong via rapid pick up, make sure to check your order ! My soup was halfway full as well!"}
{"text":"grabbed breakfast here this morning and enjoyed the spinache artichoke souffle and a coffee.  do not try to order a latte or other espresso drink because you will be disappointed.  just opt for their house blend or their columbian.  i like this panera better than the one at old farm shoppes because the clientelle seems a bit more diverse.  free wi-fi is a plus too.  yummy soups and salads but don't try to order any of the panini sandwiches without meat...they'll tell you no.  they are all premade and just waiting for the sandwich iron...kind of makes you glad you weren't allowed to order one."}
{"text":"Pretty standard fare in terms of food and drink. Panera always hits that soup/salad/sandwich spot when you can't think of anywhere else you'd like to go. This one was nice, big, clean, and in a good location. Can't really go wrong!"}
{"text":"This Panera bread location is hands down the worst. Of the last 5-6 Times I've ordered Panera takeout using their app, not ONE order was correct. I think the prep line is high and the guy checking the order just uses his red marker to cross off every order without actually checking whether the order is correct. Today I ordered a Greek grilled chicken salad that was just lettuce with half a container of dressing and a few sprinkles of feta cheese (despite the xtra cheese I ordered a paid for). NO chicken, no olives, nothing else. I didn't realize that I spent $11 for lettuce until I got home. When I called the store, I was put on hold for the manager and gave up after she never picked up after 22 minutes. I'll never make the mistake again of going to this Panera."}
{"text":"Nice looking store. Few outlets, horrible access and parking especially during weekends."}
{"text":"Not only are they slow taking orders but slow in the brain. We stood in line behind two people taking orders and waited 10 minutes so I asked if they were still doing breakfast because we walked in at quarter of 11 the guy said no I said it's not even 11 yet he said ask the manager and she came and she said yes. We finally get to the register at 10:59 mind you there was only one person in front of us ordering. I start to order breakfast and the lady said breakfast is over. I said well the manager said yes so she took my order. If the two cashiers didn't waste 15 minutes talking with the customer about everything except their order there wouldn't have been a problem. I made a comment and another customer was so angry as well and said she can't stand coming here but she didn't want to drive the 10 mikes to the next one. She said it has been like that for 10 years. My advice drive the extra ten miles because this place doesn't deserve the business."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with Panera.  The apple i got on the side with my salad was so bruised up I didn't want to eat it.  I've been trying to give them a chance since they bought Paradise Bakery.  Unfortunately almost every time we order lunch for work their is a problem with the order.  The soups are not as good anymore."}
{"text":"While the drive through is convenient, on multiple occasions they have forgotten part of my order.  Then they don't answer the phone when you call back to let them know.  I've literally been throwing money away.  Lesson learned...won't be back.  

The one time I went inside I found the tables dirty.  I actually cleaned my own table by getting napkins and water from the soda fountain.  The staff watched and did nothing to assist.  

Done with that location."}
{"text":"So this review is not for the food but for the customer service. Today I went in during lunch and of course there was a long line for lunch. There was someone taking orders for sandwiches and soups and when we got up to him, no greeting just 'What can I get for you'. We wanted a smoothie and a muffin so we were directed to another line. After waiting in a second line it's finally our turn to order and the girl at the register just stares at us. No hello, no what can I get for you, nothing. So I order and iced coffee and a muffin. She throws the cup up on the counter and goes and grabs my muffin. I then ask her where do I go to get my ice coffee, she doesn't even look up from the register and just points across the way to a drink station and says $4.58. Ok. Fine. I'm over it that yall aren't in a good mood but the icing on the cake was when I asked another employee who was clearing off a table where the restrooms were. He didn't look up from the table and just pointed to the back of the store ..... Collectively worst customer service I have experienced in a VERY long time."}
{"text":"I love Panera Bread! I enjoy being able sit at a table for a while and work on your computer or just hang and talk. The have tons of seating and plugs available. I used to come here for hours with my friend and work on our fantasy football line-ups. I used to get the Italian sandwich and broccoli and cheddar soup. I would get a danish or a bagel for dessert after sitting there for a while. Now, I usually get a salad, mac & cheese and/or soup. The reason for 4 stars in that they changed there ingredients in the Italian sandwich. They went to a healthy menu but that Italian sandwich was so good and now it's terrible. I know it's a stupid reason for a four star review but that Italian sandwich was that damn good!"}
{"text":"Gross! We usually go the Brecksville Panera but decided to try this one today... terrible decision. The restaurant was just not clean and the employees were so unfriendly. But the WORST part was the table of smokers sitting 3 ft from the entrance puffing smoke in my 6 month old's face as we walked in! Yeah, definitely made me excited to spend $40+ on sandwiches (SARCASM!) so gross, this isn't a neighborhood bar. Take your cancer sticks elsewhere. Shame on you Panera for allowing this on your patio."}
{"text":"I have been to different locations in my area and this is my favorite one. The employees are very nice and my order is always done properly. The prices are reasonable for the quality of the food. I would suggest you enroll as a MyPanera Member, that way you can earn rewards through every transaction. For example, $2 off your next purchase, $1 off a pastry, free bagel, etc. It's well worth it. Internet connection is great and parking is accessible. The only disadvantage is the lack of outlets that are available for someone looking to get some work done."}
{"text":"I last ate at a Panera a few years ago in Nevada on a road trip, and it was terrible. We popped in today feeling like soup and something light, and it was great.  Unsweetened iced tea is a bonus also not like the sweet crap we get here in Canada.

A tad on the expensive side but gluten free sandwich was well liked and soup was really good. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Bad. Just bad. I love eating Panera but this one needs better leadership. Order was wrong twice."}
{"text":"I've been a Panera fan for many years. It's always pretty good. There are plenty of selections -- good bagels, soups, and sandwiches. The staff are nice and helpful at this and all locations.

I'm not sure what it is (if my tastes have changed or the restaurant has), but the food (all of it) just doesn't taste as good as I remember. Still, sometimes you have a hankerin' for a pastry, soup, or sandwiches, so... it's a decent choice."}
{"text":"Big fan of this chain! All items are posted with calorie info, free coffee/tea refills, great for all diet types and no servers! In past visits the music selection (wish no restaurant played any) has been light jazz,  at a soft volume...  Much better for conversations. Something for absolutely everyone here! Soups are my favourite menu pick."}
{"text":"awful service. always the same rude girl working the register. they always mess up my order when i ask for a salad with no chicken. i probably will never eat at a panera ever again. too many bad experiences and the food is not worth it & significantly lacks flavor unless you get a dish smothered in cheese."}
{"text":"Now I love Panera! But the parking at this location is terrible no matter what time of day! For the parking I had to knock off one star. Other than that I love sitting outside and enjoying some yummy food! I'm in love with the Soba noodle bowl with chicken. Avocado Chicken Cobb salad is a fav and delicious as well."}
{"text":"They got my order completely wrong. Gave me soup instead of the Mac and cheese I ordered and gave me an avocado and chicken sandwich when I ordered a southwestern.. Two thumbs down."}
{"text":"I just finished eating my food I ordered and couldn't be more disappointed. First off, I got a 1/2 bravo and 1/2 caesar salad for the pick 2 option... First off, they don't have ranch for the salads..? Weird. I ordered it to go and stood by the counter to get my food. 10 minutes later and the 6 different groups after me all got their food and I'm still waiting. Eventually they discovered they put the Togo order in a name that's not even close to mine and it's been sitting there. I got home and ate my food. So many problems.. First off, the croutons were soooooo soggy!!! I ended up giving them to my dog who couldn't even chew them. Second, my PANINI wasn't even grilled. Gross.. Personally, I don't want cold bacon on a sandwich. 
All in all, I will not be returning. All I wanted was a nice clean healthier meal and it wasn't even worth it.. Let alone worth the $10 I spent on it.. 
Do not recommend, will not return."}
{"text":"Good for a cup of joe and a bagel. Always clean. Staff helpful and friendly. My favorite bagels (in no particular order) French Toast, Multigrain, asiago cheese and believe it or not Plain. I do my bagels au natural, not toasted or schmeared. For lunch you can't go wrong with the broccoli cheddar."}
{"text":"Being a chain, the food is pretty much the same no matter what branch you go to. What sets this place apart from the other branches I frequent are the sour expressions on all 3 people behind the counter. At 6:00 a.m., it would be nice to see even a half smile from the lady taking our order. Nope! This place scores zero on customer service."}
{"text":"Pretty good, service was friendly, food was served quickly, looked and tasted great! Could've been better on the cleanliness side though, we had to clean off our own table and the restroom was just ok. I'd go back."}
{"text":"It's either hit or miss. I have been here several times already since moving. Some workers seem competent others not so much. As if they wish they were somewhere else by looking past me in a daze. I get it I would probably hate working here too. 

It gets crowded around lunch time-duh. But the food comes out on time. So 3 stars for them."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and was surprised how much seating there is in here (2 floors). It's really clean and nice inside - clearly they pay attention to details here. Service is efficient. You order at the counter and they take down your name. They call your name when your order is ready. I had the Mediterranean egg white breakfast sandwich -- egg whites, sundried tomato, spinach, and cheese on their soft focaccia bread. Yummy and healthy! They have tons of loaves, croissants, and other pastries as well as soups and salads. Breakfast sandwiches are ~$5, so it's more expensive than say, Timmie's, but it's a nice treat."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Been here a few times before. Ordered the turkey, avocado and bacon sandwich with chips and a drink today. You get chucks of turkey, not slices, which I can take or leave. 

Order came up pretty quickly. Clean location with plenty of seating.

Only downfall is, it's pretty expensive for the amount of food you get. I spent $10.95 for a sandwich, small bag of chips and a smedium drink, which I think is kinda absurd.

I rarely eat here and I will keep up that trend."}
{"text":"This may not be a fair review, because I did not stay to eat. My review though, is based on the fact that this place is the exact same as Paradise Bakery. Not even the baked goods were different from Paradise. Same cookies, etc. I'm sorry, but are we sheep? Slap a new name on the items? I don't care for Paradise Bakery as it was. Panera USED to be much better, imo. I was at least hopeful to still get some of my favorite Panera baked goods. I truly hope it's just because they just opened."}
{"text":"Wow - didn't realize my first review of this place was so error ridden and grammatically challenged.  I will blame it on autocorrect on my phone, but who is to say it wasn't my full emotional anger coming through in my review.

Since my first review, I have come back and had pretty decent experiences here.  Just have to know when to hit it (avoid the weekends) during odd hours to make sure  crowds and wait times aren't as bad."}
{"text":"Definitely a Panera fan.  I ate breakfast here not to long ago on my way to an appointment for work in the SouthPark area.  Had my usual 'breakfast power sandwich.'  A great way to start the day.

This location is convenient to Southpark, but it's a little hard to get in and out.  Granted all the intersections in that area are fairly busy, so they probably planned it out correctly.  You can easily see it from the street, but then (if driving) it may be difficult to figure out where you need to go to park, but once you do it once, it's pretty easy.

Free WiFi... and a good place for warm food, studying, or meeting people out."}
{"text":"Brand new Panera located off of west Tyvola where the old Hornets Coliseum used to be.  The complexity of apartments, hotels, and now restaurants should be a welcome change from the imploded arena site.

This Panera has a drive thru... and a nicely sized out door seating area with tables and umbrellas.

I was super surprised that the inside finding area only has about 12 or so tables, so I can imagine this place getting slammed during peak meal times.  It's still rather nice and has the \"new paint smell\".  The typical Panera decor is here with warm woods and clean white plates.

The staff is friendly and I think they designed this place with their business model in mind as far as the large case of pastries and registers up on the right and then the buzzers and number system so the runners can find you in the dining area.

The drive-thru line looks like it can handle a good amount of cars... so probably just another way to serve people and not have to leave your car.  The drive thru also wraps around the building so be careful walking up to the building."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Panera!  Their menu is big enough (and tasty enough) to pretty much eat every meal here.  I usually just go for lunch.  Lately I have been doing their \"Pick Two\" option for lunch so 1/2 salad and 1/2 a sandwich or 1/2 a sandwich and a cup of soup... mix and match.

It was a little crowded today, I thought the rain would force everyone to stay indoors, so there was some jockeying going on for tables (since it was also cold outside).  Had a bowl of warm broccoli cheddar soup with half a tuna sandwich on honey wheat.  Hit the spot."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here this morning after an appointment.  Can't go wrong with breakfast at Panera.  

My one gripe about this place is the parking lot.  It's a little tight in places and people drive like they own the place.  I've had numerous close calls in the parking lot and also just trying to turn in from Providence can be a hassle as well.  If you brave all the road rage, you will be rewarded with some good sandwiches or baked treats."}
{"text":"I ordered the Power Kale Salad with Chicken. But there was no kale and no chicken. Since I got it to go and hoped back on the turn pike, by the time I opened up the bag it was too late to go back"}
{"text":"Had lunch here after getting my nails done in the Waterfront.  It's your standard Panera - lots of seating and a sunny room from all the windows.  Our food was made very quickly, even though the place was pretty busy (lunch on a Saturday).  Chicken noodle soup is tasty, but there was too much broth and not enough noodles and chicken.  I tried their Sierra Chicken sandwich for the first time, and it was pretty good.  It's very flavorful, I like whatever they put in their chipotle mayo.  It was a salty meal though - definitely had me running to the fountain machine to get more water.

If I have to get a quick, light meal and only chain options are available, Panera is my best choice.  It's definitely predictable and usually tasty.  But there isn't much special about it, of course."}
{"text":"Another favorite lunch spot for me, just don't go between 12 and 1 because it's usually so busy that there isn't even a seat on the floor.  

What's not to like about Panera?  Good paninis, good sandwiches and great salads.  Oh and don't forget the baked goods.  My favorites thing to order lately is the Chicken cobb salad.  mmmmm.  Oh and those darn cinnamon rolls.  

This place could be very dangerous if you stick around too long.  And they encourage you to do so with comfortable seating and free Wi-fi."}
{"text":"Stopped here after visiting the doctor because I needed something for breakfast and didn't want to visit a fast food joint.

Parking is difficult here during the work week as the location sits right in front of an office building and the lot is relatively small considering the restaurant has to share parking with an AT&T store, a dentist and the offices behind it.

Once inside I noticed this store seems to be laid out a lot better than other Paneras I've been in.  Seating is to the right and not all over the place.  The ordering counter is directly in front of you, coffee is directly across from the counter.

So I ordered my breakfast - bacon, egg and cheese on a bagel and got it to go since I was on my way to work.

I waited a short time because they said they had to cook my bacon but it seemed they were also busy making sandwiches for a corporate lunch.  No biggie.  I wasn't really in a hurry to get to work.

The sandwich was wonderful.  I checked the egg and it looks like they cook the egg there and not use some sort of pre-made egg food like many places seem to do.  

So for food alone, I'd give them 4 stars but for parking I give them 2.  It averages out to my 3-star rating."}
{"text":"Stopped at this panera because my usually breakfast and coffee on the run joint was packed with no parking.  At least this one had parking, though it was still busy because I had forgotten about the Race for the Cure going on this morning.  Oh well.

So I order my usual breakfast sandwich on a bagel.  The bagel choices are slim with only 2 still available.  Ouch.  Oh well, I went with the jalapeno/cheddar bagel and a coffee.  

Panera's coffee is ok but I can sense it's not something they are known for.  The sandwich was delicious.  But I was still hoping for another flavor of bagel.  

Next time I need to get their earlier to get a better selection."}
{"text":"This is one of the larger Paneras I've been in.  The restaurant is laid out well too.  Everything is in order as it wraps around the back of the restaurant. 

And like many other Paneras, it is difficult to find a seat during the lunch rush hour.  But the food is consistent with other locations and that is what is important."}
{"text":"I stop in every Monday for bagels for work.  Couldn't ask for nicer people to help me out.  Always going above and beyond to make sure i have a great experience!"}
{"text":"Open late, they extended their hours until 10pm.
my favorite part about this location is the outdoor seating area. Very spacious, has a fire pit and great patio furniture. Design wise, this is a probably a nicer panera bread than other locations.
Has a bathroom with more than 1 stalls. 
Has bulletin by the bathroom for classifieds."}
{"text":"Just that, a meh experience.
1. Why does panera make you tip when there arent servers? If anything i'd rather tip at chick fil la. I selected no tips, because i didnt feel like there was any service rendered other than the lady charging me up. She then gave me somewhat of a look....OK
2. I specifically said i wanted olive oil to go with my bread, when the order was filled, no olive oil.
3. Came during regular dinner tome 6:15pm, the restaurant was almost empty...strange. Maybe it's more popular during lunch time."}
{"text":"Indecisive about what to eat. Stuck in bumper to bumper traffic, so first thing I see, Panera Bread. Let's give it a try, clean environment positive people. I was looking around and noticed a few tablets when you can take your own order than seat yourself, after taking a number. They have very unique types of drinks witch on the healthy side of things makes everything better. I sat down and waited for the buzzer to go off an within five mins of me placing my order, my food was brought to my table. For the most part everything was great except the bread witch there supposed to be known for I'm sure. It was on the harder side of things and kinda chewy, this was my first experience and maby they just didn't bake it right, or that's how it was delivered ether way. The food was delicious but they can hold the bread next time"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Panera. I like that I can find something here for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The options are relatively healthy, but you can always find something a little unhealthy too. 

You can pick two. A combination of sandwich and/or soup and/or salad. pick two. good stuff. Great selection of sandwiches, panini's and soups. 

They also have fresh baked goods, bagels, espresso drinks, fresh teas and fruit smoothies. 

Prices are pretty reasonable and if you have a panera card you can get free pastries/cookies or drinks after a certain number of purchases. 

this location is cool. it gets busy and parking can be rough at times, but the staff is good and i've never had an issue. 

I like coming here. it's a good place."}
{"text":"I have had some issues with this location. I have had rapid orders that took 5-10 minutes longer than the projected timeframe. But my biggest issue was my last visit. I ordered a loaf of asagio bread as a rapid order. When my order came up it had a note to speak with a manager on it. I speak with the manager and he says that the bread I ordered was out and he can only make a swap for something else, he can't credit my account for the bread they sold out of. I literally had to call the customer service line to have a credit issued. The woman who helped me was surprised as well. The customer service rep gave me a  credit of $10.00 which was more than my whole bill. I was happy with my customer service number experience, but big fail for the manager on duty that day."}
{"text":"Our ticket time was 15 minutes on a very slow day. Our order was to go so I didn't even realize that our order was messed up and poorly made until we got home. We ordered a sausage, egg & cheese bagel and instead we got a steak and egg bagel. The Mediterranean sandwich that was ordered was all egg...barely any toppings so it tasted like egg on bread and was horrible. Also, they made my latte immediately, so it sat and waited for the food and was cold when I received it. We won't be back."}
{"text":"So tasty, everyone is so polite & professional ! Good clean environment that is a smile for the rest of the day . Thee browines are so delectable! I can eat these cookies here everyday."}
{"text":"Now two stars...  Went this past weekend for lunch and enjoyed the patio.  Nice to be outside, but they need more tables that accommodate more than 2 people.  Also, the queueing system is still a nightmare.  Still confusing.  Plus our food took a long time to come out...

Another thing I didn't like was that when I was getting silverware, I looked at the spoons and there was one with a big chunk of lettuce/spinach on it.  Gross.

If the food wasn't good and they didn't keep sending me two-for-one coupons, I wouldn't go here..."}
{"text":"Should chicken salad be white? Isn't chicken and mayo more of a tan color?  

But no, the salad was so white I thought I was being served a cottage cheese sandwich. The chicken salad lacked any texture, more like mashed potatoes, and hardly any walnuts. It was not a generous sandwich--the only other toppings I recall were lettuce and tomato served on non-artisan bread. 

I had remembered the Paradise Bakery at Metrocenter of years ago, okay many years ago, and was impressed with their food then. This sandwich was just okay and the Mediterranean salad was pretty good.

The parking here is limited and driving through the congested area is a difficult. I would hesitate to visit during the busy hours--there would be no spaces!

Some pluses:  The atmosphere with brick walls, tall ceilings and booths (I love booths).  I liked the bright chunky plates. Their menu is extensive. The acai berry iced tea was great.  

Now if only Paradise was more like Wildflower Bakery, serving artisan bread and generous sandwiches I would be totally happy."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the service isn't bad. They just forget things like the 99 cent pastry and I wasn't mad enough to write a review except they totally dissed me on my chai latte. I wouldn't have paid for a large... I rather I would have just gone to Starbucks if I had known you wouldn't have given me what my money was worth. Like I just opened my cup, thinking it was light walking out and it was... however they gave me an extra cookie so that's the only reason I gave you five stars."}
{"text":"I was so happy I remembered this location as I was going to visit my Dad. I love the spicy thai chicken salad! Katie took my order and was quick to have it out to me. I was so hungry as I had little to eat all day. It was delicious! Thanks Katie!"}
{"text":"Panera Bread, although a tad overpriced in my opinion, is a decent place to a grab a quick bite to eat. I am not going to say they are a healthy option compared to other \"fast\" type eateries because I don't think everything on their menu is really promoting great health. However, it is a step up from a burger and fries combo at McDonald's. 

This Panera is a staple of The District, sits directly facing the parking lot and is conveniently located. The establishment is large and spacious, which is good, because anytime I have been here the place has been steady with patrons. Customer service is good, although I always get hit up to get their card, which I decline, because I don't go to Panera enough to warrant getting the card. Plus, all in all I am kind of fed up with this every freakin' place I go wants to give me some card deal. Hrumph. Anyway.

Food - I ordered the Chipotle Panini and my husband ordered the Smokehouse Trukey Panini. Both came out deliciously melty and warm, pressed perfectly. I received mine with chips, my husband got a cut up apple, so we shared. Overall loved the paninis. We also ordered a yummy blueberry muffin which was dense and flavorful. 

Quality vs. price - Again, as stated above I feel Panera to be overpriced. I got two combo paninis (which do not come with a drink), one small drink, and a muffin, my total came to almost 20 bucks. The paninis are on the smaller side, so the price value does not exactly match the quality and quantity of what you are receiving. However, the taste is good.

So you have to fight your battles with fast, convenient, \"healthier\" food. Of course I will return to Panera Bread in the future. I just wish it did not hurt my wallet so bad."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Panera Bread in general. They're good for an alternative to Quiznos or Subway. It *seems* like you're eating a little healthier as well, but I won't hold my breathe on whether or not that is actually true. 

This particular one can get super packed, but I was there today right around lunchtime on a Saturday and my friend and I didn't wait at all to get our orders in. 

I like that they have people who come around and take your plates from your table when you're done. Also, I am a HUGE fan of the chips they serve with their sandwiches. Extra crunchy and tasty! My go-to sandwich is the Ceasar Salad Sandwich and I always get it with half the cheese they normally put on it. The romaine lettuce always has a snap and the tomatoes and red onions are always rockin'. 

Overall Panera is a good stop for a quick lunch or if you're hankering for a sammich and you just want to go for an old stand-by."}
{"text":"I called in a cookie cake order and my instructions were...\"no words just do frosting around the rim and random squiggly lines and dots, just the basic brown and white frosting is good\"  I then had my assistant pick it up for me and I about died when I saw it! This was supposed to be a treat to a local church but needless to say the staff ate it instead, I will NEVER order from this location again!  Picture is posted..."}
{"text":"I normally love Panera but today I went to the Medina location. I heard the girl making my sandwich ask her coworker something about my order but I couldn't  tell what. Anyway I checked my bag on the way out and everything seemed to be there. When I got home I realized what the problem was they ran out of bread and used the nasty crusty end pieces of the tomato basil bread to make half of my sandwich, so gross. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"The place is the spot for a great light breakfast.  Place has a great vibe and the customer service is amazing.  Joe the GM along with his staff AnnaMarie, Josefa and Rich and the rest of the staff are on point and always going above and beyond to make your experience a comfortable one.  My family and I enjoy coming here, definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm just so happy to finally have a Panera close to home!! Home is actually what Panera feels like. It's all about the comfort foods: soups, sandwiches, panini, pastas, stews, coffee, baked goods, and free WiFi!! The last time I was there I had a vegetable soup, and a big kid grilled cheese. They were both really good. Their coffee is not the greatest but that's just a minor detail. In its kind, I believe Panera is the best, yes even for a giant American chain."}
{"text":"Horrible every time we order here the order is wrong. Tonight we ordered a southwest salad got all the way home and all that was in the box was lettuce and chicken ! ABSOLUTELY NOTHING else! Really you charge $10 for a salad with nothing on it, then make us drive back just to tell me then sorry your out of corn. That's fine but what about the other 10 ingredients that was supposed to be on it? And now that we had to drive 15 minutes each way sure other food isn't going to be that great either. Thanks for horrible customer service and no apology. No wonder you have two stars and everyone says that they no longer go to your establishment.

Part 2, if you can't even believe it there is a part two. Husband brings home salad number 2 this time there's no chicken. But there is a ton of quinoa , which the staff said comes on that salad. Funny your menu doesn't say so.We refused to drive back but at least the refunded the salad, but now I have no dinner.

So sad as Paradise use to be one of my favorite places to go!"}
{"text":"Ordered the soba noodle bowl with chicken to go after seeing it in a commercial. Such a great choice as it was super yummy and flavorful. Placed the to go order over the phone and it was ready as soon as my husband arrived to pick it up. Now that I know their to go orders are so quick, I'll definitely plan on ordering again soon."}
{"text":"Warning!  This Panera Bread will ALWAYS be out of something or it will be a mess either one!!!  I think for being a new location, corporate Panera needs to come and give the management team a lesson.

I refuse to be aggravated and after giving them 4 or 5 tries -- the aggravation is not worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre, kind of expensive and you don't get much, it's extremely hot in there to the point I just leave and go somewhere else! There is no need for a place to be so hot that I'm sweating 2 seconds in the door! Ridiculous! On the upside staff is very nice and they have a very good chocolate chip cookie!"}
{"text":"Always great service when I go to a Panera. I really love this one though because it's always very clean and fast. Today we tried the order from your table on the app and it was awesome. It was just as fast and I think I'll do it every time. Ordering from the app also allows you to see if there are any new coupons that can be used. Today I got a free pastry since my birthday was s few weeks ago. They have the best turkey chili and all the bread is phenomenal and made fresh. I also ordered a loaf of wheat bread to take home which they cut for me."}
{"text":"Although the sign still says Paradise Bakery it is now a Panera Bread. A lot of the stores have not went through the remodel process. It is a huge location for the location. Very clean inside and we were acknowledged right away. I ordered the turkey chili like always because it is my favorite thing. I always order s baguette for my side, but you can also request chips or something else. Another favorite of mine is the passion papaya green tea. I literally will drive miles out of my way some days to get it. It feels light and refreshing every time especially on a hot day. My only issue I'd address that might be troublesome is the parking. Tonight isnt bad, but on a busy day the front parking lot with the two hours validated parking may fill up quick. There is however valet parking and a parking garage I saw near the back."}
{"text":"Good points:
Plenty of parking. 
Sandwich I ate was delicious (Med. veggie).

Bad points:
Notwithstanding recent articles on how \"healthful\" their menu has become, I find it rather pitiful.  They did include a real apple with my sandwich, though.  There's too much emphasis on sweet pastries! 
Weak coffee. 
Over priced for what you get. 
Service is weak (even for Madtown)."}
{"text":"On a long layover at Skyharbor Airport, my BFF and I walked to the other terminals bam specificallly to buy a Panera pastry.  The young man at the counter (dark hair, glasses, zaftig, with the requisite millennial hoody), wouldn't walk over to the pastry case so we could tell him which unlabeled pastry we each wanted.  When my BFF asked him to walk over so we could point out what we wanted, he yelled and said \"You don't have to talk to me like that.  I'm not stupid.\"  We determined that at the very least he was neither kind nor service oriented, so we went to buy a pastry somewhere else.  We will not buy from Panera at Skyharbor. I think they get away with treating people poorly because it is in an airport and people are in too much of a hurry to complain."}
{"text":"Make sure you check how much dressing they give you on a to go order. I got less than half a plastic container that barely covered a third of my salad (and I like light dressing)."}
{"text":"Eating at this Panera was a huge disappointment. Panera is a poorly managed chain (as evidenced by this store) and we will NEVER go back to a Panera ever again due to our experience at this location. The only thing I would consider ever ordering again is the green tea, but certainly not the food. First of all, they got rid of over half the menu and made the portion sizes much smaller. For 39$ we should get more than a handful of macaroni, soup, and salad (the tiny cups they gave us were only halfway full). Also, for 39$ the customer service should be better than a taco bell, but it is not. The teenagers working here are rude and careless. The young lady on the drive-through intercom failed to even mention that they were OUT of Panini bread. How do you run out of panini bread when half of your menu is paninis?! The nicer young man at the drive through counter had to explain to us that the panini bread was out and asked what bread they could substitute but this should have been explained immediately by the young woman when I was actually ordering it. Panera is a poorly managed joke. I cannot wait to see Panera go out of business! You would think that regional managers and other higher ups in Panera would look at the pathetic reviews regarding this particular location and actually do something to fix it before they continue to lose more and more customers but it is obvious that they don't care."}
{"text":"Why does it never smell like fresh bread in this place? Is it not named \"Panera Bread\"?"}
{"text":"Don't tip you cashier at Panera and you don't get your entire order. I returned for my cookie and was ignored by the same cashier that forgot the cookie I paid for. Horrible customer service stay away."}
{"text":"I love Panera Bread! Clean establishment. Good service. Fast as well and even got my order correct. I would come back!"}
{"text":"1 outlet in the whole place.  salad was good but how you do business or hold a meeting. This is supposed to be a gathering place.  The ones in Rocky River and Westlake are far better and business friendly.  For the overpriced menu I expect better.
Sincerely.     Will not be Back"}
{"text":"One star is one too many for my lunch today.  I ordered the chicken tortellini pasta bowl.  Very disappointed in my lunch.  Where do I begin?  The size of the lunch first.  Because I was shocked at how small it was for $9 I actually took the time to count the tortellini.  I had 15 tortellini pastas in my bowl.  And they are really small ones at that. The chicken that covered it was disgusting and dry. But the good thing is I barely had any on my pasta.  The alfredo sauce was non existent. This meal was flavorless and I will most definitely not order it again.  To top everything off the silverware that was placed on my plate was dirty.  I expect more from Panera.  I'm not writing off this place.  I'll be back. But I'm not happy with today's lunch. Thanks for wasting my lunch time Panera!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I will never ever set foot in this place again!  I was willing to give it a chance even knowing that it used to be Paradise Bakery.  This isn't a bakery, it's a Fakery. Menu is boring, I was hoping that it would surprise me.  I had the roasted chicken flatbread - horrible!  Bland, boring, and about 3 days of your recommended sodium intake in 2 bites.
The Interior design - kiosks, tech feel, plug ins for laptops but nothing about this place makes you want to hang out.  Filthy un-bused tables, greasy looking employees make you worry about what's really in your sandwich.
I give this Panera chain 2 years tops before they fold, sell it, rename it, and fail again."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place is a chain of restaurants! (I also use the term restaurant very loosely in regards to Panera Bread) I went here with my sister, who recommended it (unsure how we are related at this point). 
The food here is so overpriced, I ordered the soup and sandwich combo (veggie sandwich and french onion soup). The sandwich was okay, edible at least but I don't understand how they pass their french onion soup as french onion soup. It was beef broth with bits of cheese on top! 
The servers were not polite and the man taking our order kept sighing at my sister because she entered her debit pin wrong once. 

What a terrible experience, I will not be back!"}
{"text":"EMILY SAVES THE DAY! We order Panera bread sandwiches on their app, all the time. We've always gotten good food, at a reasonable price, including delivery! Today however, I had a bad experience. In the middle of my order, my phone froze and ended up ordering an extra sandwich that I didn't want. I immediately called the store to remedy the situation. During this time, I sat on hold for 25 minutes total and literally got hung up on 5 (Yes Five) times. As you can imagine, I was seething by this time. 

My order was delivered before I could get a manager on the phone! I ended up refusing the order, when delivered. Calling the store back and finally speaking to Emily, the manager! 

I explained my predicament, she apologized and offered the correct order, for FREE! That's NOT what I asked for! I just want my original order and I'll pay for it! She had the sandwiches remade and sent back out, with the correct charge. 

Had I gotten hung up on, a 6th time? I'd never go back. But Emily made things right and also sent a personal note and a cookie with the order, for the inconvenience 

Thanks Emily! But please train your employees how to operate a PHONE!"}
{"text":"This Panera provides quick and efficient service and the food is good and on par with other Paneras. 

The drive through is a bit slow but that's to be expected when your food is made to order. It's not McDonald's where they can grab that pre-made burger and plop it in a bag for you. The more complicated the order the longer the wait just as if you ordered inside. You just get to sit in your car and wait when you do drive through. 

They do a good job with rapid delivery where you order online then pick up your food. It is a faster option than drive through and most importantly, they get the order right! 

Oh, and for the people complaining about prices it's the same price at all Paneras. If you think it's expensive and not worth the value then you should be frequenting McDonald's or Cook Out where they have value menus. If you think the quality doesn't match the prices then you should take that up with corporate. 

I find customer service at this location to be quite good. They aim to please. If there is ever a problem with your order you can tell someone and they will do what they can to resolve it. Exactly how it should be!"}
{"text":"I love the food at Panera and I have never had any trouble with the service - but this place really needs to do a better job at washing dishes. YUCK. Why are my forks always gritty and greasy when I come here? :("}
{"text":"Solid Panera as always, not sure what's with all the hate on this location? We had a good experience with great treats and refreshing coffee. Staff was polite and service quick. We will be back."}
{"text":"Another solid Panera (aka St. Louis Bread Co!) 

Love the drink station where you can get that wonderful berry tea, or iced coffee, or sweet tea, or water, or some of those HFCS Sodas. Love the atmosphere and how they now bring the food to you instead of the old way we used to wait like cows at the feed troff awkwardly watching our food being prepared. I wonder if it was the public who suggested this change or rather the staff from all the strange people staring at them the whole time.  I vote the later.

Anyway food is great, always fresh, and I feel better about myself after eating there. Honestly how many places can you say that about?? McD's? Pizza? yeah right! only at Panera can this be possible. Ok maybe at your vegan salad juice bar that you bicycled ten miles to on your way to yoga class at 6am before your work at the health food store. Yeah maybe that place too. 

Wait this is a review about Panera... yeah so food is top notch and I always order from the actual human and not those antisocial iPads they've now installed. boo!! paneara! bad choice. Keep it human, screw technology. Well except for that mysterious table food sonar delivery thing, thats cool, keep that. 

Eat more Panera and now its time for more berry tea!..."}
{"text":"I've never had any problems here. It's always been a pleasant experience. The food is great, service is as quick as the line allows, and dining room clean. I'm not sure why this Panera gets such bad reviews? We stop in here all the time to enjoy a nice breakfast. This is a convenient location to all the shopping in the area also."}
{"text":"James Golich is an extraordinary employee. Every sandwich he makes is amazing and arguably the closest experience an individual can have to a divine revelation. Honestly I will be coming back just to be in his presence."}
{"text":"Service is SO SLOW. Anytime we come here we always have an unnaturally long wait for our food. We even ordered ahead this time and have been waiting 20 minutes for a bread bowl and a salad. Three times they've run out of bread bowls which is always disappointing because you come here with a specific taste for it. It's called Panera BREAD you shouldn't run out of bread. 

So frustrating. We continue to go here though since it's the closest one."}
{"text":"I love Panera's menu but this location seems to attract people who just want to hang out and use the wifi.  Last visit, a couple sat near us and he was sleeping with his head in her lap.  What a turn-off."}
{"text":"I just have never enjoyed going to Panera and this one is no exception.

It always seems grimy and the people that work there always seem so frazzled.

We got the turkey sausage bagel that comes with cheese, tomatoes and basil.  The turkey was fairly tasteless, maybe as a turkey patty it passes, but not as turkey sausage.  The tomatoes and basil just make the bagel soggy if you aren't eating it fast enough.

We asked for one with no cheese and the girl confirmed the order, but it had cheese on it when it came, so that had to be remade.  We also ordered a mocha and a hot chocolate...they were so watery and bland that it was very difficult to tell which was which...we took those back for a refund.

Parking in this center can be sort of a nightmare.  Definitely planned from when there wasn't that much traffic coming into this location.

Maybe some of their other selections are better, but I probably won't go back to check it out."}
{"text":"Excellent French onion soup and can't chicken wild rice soup.  Love it that they have good tea selection available.  Had the Chinese cashew citrus chicken salad, but the ice berg looked a tad old."}
{"text":"Not sure what the deal is, I've ordered from Panera 3 times in 2 weeks and each time there has been an issue with my order. I've complained about it and was told we'll make it right, and each time they have returned with the right food. But if this keep happening what do I suppose to do? It's really annoying when you order food trust that it'll be right and it's not."}
{"text":"It's a good place to go in and grab a danish, bagel, or even a hot breakfast sandwich, which I will occasionally do, especially on the weekends. 

I rarely eat in because I'm always in such a hurry, but when I do, I like that they enable their wifi for customers so that can respond to email, check stocks, other misc things. 

Their staff is always very customer service oriented. In fact, while I was waiting for my bagels and filling up my coffee cup, one of their staff members walked up to me and hand delivered them. I thought that was a nice and thoughtful gesture."}
{"text":"Used to be delicious! Since Panera took over it has lost all the charm and doesn't have any of the good baked goods it used to! Too bad!"}
{"text":"I love Panera in general and like this location. 

I've been on a low carb kick for a log while and it's pretty hard to eat here when you're on a low carb diet. Since  I completed my marathon, I've been indulging a bit. I love the Fontega Chicken with either creamy tomato or broccoli cheddar soup (Pick Two). There are many great options though. However, how is the big kids Grilled Cheese adult priced? 

This location gets busy but not so busy that you can find a seat. The people are friendly as well. All-in-all, a great spot to east lunch and a decent place for an early dinner."}
{"text":"I really like Panera and this is a great location (minus the parking lot).

They have indoor/outdoor seating. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. The staff is really friendly and the food is awesome! Great soups and sandwiches...and fab pastries!! I am totally addicted to their orange scones!!"}
{"text":"Staff need training on social skills and customer service. Bathrooms dirty. Food ok. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Fantastic Panera bread! 
I placed an online catering order to be picked up at this location. The order was fulfilled perfectly and on time! They even offered to help me carry it up!

Highly recommend this Panera Bread for catering services!"}
{"text":"This 2 star review is for customer service and order fulfillment.

I placed an online catering order a week in advance for 8AM pick up. I arrived at 7:55AM to pick up the order. Let's just say they started prepping my bagel order at 8:05AM. My order wasn't complete until 8:30AM. The excuse for the order not being ready was \"we received this order 10 minutes prior to 8AM\", which obviously was not true Bc I arrived at 7:55 and they hadn't even started on my order.  Not only was my order not filled, but they put the dozens of bagels in different boxes (as opposed to the large catering boxes) and gave me the small containers of the 2oz of cream cheese (instead of the tubs). Needless to say, I am very disappointed in this Panera Bread. I have ordered catering boxes online at other Panera breads before and never had a problem."}
{"text":"Getting new winter tires for my vehicle next door at discount tire. Decided to have a lunch here. Very yummy coffee and tasty panini. Nice and clean lication. Long line but it took me less than a minute to place an order."}
{"text":"I am so sad Panera changed so many great things that Paradise Bakery had! Panera pretty please bring back giving a scrumptious chocolate chip cookie with every meal. Don't worry I still buy a ton extra even though you give me one free.

They also took away their mango iced tea. Awful.

The food isn't bad. I really like thier chicken salad and bakery items. Soups are usually pretty good. Pricing is a little high (especially now since there is no cookie included in your meal....) I feel like some of the menu items changed or taste different. 

They have a lot more digital menu technology features and an option to express order your food on an ipad. Less human interaction. Kind of like being able to order on the ipad but dont lose the option of having a person available to actually speak to. 

Would be willing to give an additional star for each item brought back. Cookie and mango tea."}
{"text":"I had a meeting here yesterday, and we ate and discussed some business for a non-profit we volunteer for.  Last month I saw one of the people in our group had the winter squash soup, which looked good, so I planned on ordering it, but sadly they took it off the menu.  Not sure why, considering it is still winter, and squash should still be in season, but whatever, it was gone.  I ordered half a sandwich instead, a turkey, avocado, BLT, which came with a bag of chips (and water to drink, which, like Arlene mentioned in her review, the cup is so small, you'd need to refill it numerous times, but I was in a meeting, and wasn't able to get a refill, so I was parched after it ran dry).  My sandwich was delivered to the table in a timely manner, but I was sadly disappointed to see the T (Tomato) in my sandwich was the crappiest looking, unripe, butts from the ends of the tomato.   Why do they even bother putting such a horrible piece of tomato on a sandwich, let alone two of them?   They should've been tossed in the compost bin by the prep-chef . . . oh well.  Also, for a supposed \"bakery,\"  I would've expected a better sandwich bread than just plain old white.  Aren't you supposed to get a choice of what kind of bread you wish for your sandwiches here?  If so, nobody asked me, and I forgot to ask.  Also, the bag of chips contained a very minimal amount (I dumped them on the plate in my photo so you can see the amount). In conclusion, after paying $7.00 for lunch, I received a less than perfect sandwich, a tiny amount of chips (and water) and I was still hungry and thirsty when I left.  No Cheers for this place (sad face)."}
{"text":"So, I heard a commercial on the radio for their new chicken stew with some type of cheese biscuit in it. Sounded great!! Especially with all this chilly weather. We just happened to be shopping across the street and decided to have lunch here. Quite a bit on the menu. I did order the chicken stew, it was pretty good although I thought it was a bit too thick for my liking. Also had some kind of steak panini, which was pretty delicious. Service was quick but the seating was so cramped together you could hardly move around. I was a little upset to see one of the employees come out and offer to clear a couple of nearby tables but when we were finished she just kept walking around us. Not that big of a deal seeing as you are responsible for your own trash, but a small detail that will keep me from going back to that location. The food in itself wasn't too bad, stuff i could probably make at home though."}
{"text":"I got one of their lunch specials sandwiches. It consisted of a Turkey Sandwich with an apple. The sandwich was not good. The bread was soggy & the crust was much more hard then it needed to be. There are so many places to eat around Square One...eat somewhere else!"}
{"text":"My lunch spot today. Mid-Summer. I had a Turkey Breast Panini w Bacon & Mustard. Decent flavour combo but the sandwich looked like a dogs breakfast. It was all lopsided & over cooked on one side  you could clearly see that it was just slapped together & rushed. The place was busy but not busy enough to warrant that type of poor quality. I would have complained but it was a business lunch so I just ate it & said nothing. I'll know for next time!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad Panera Bread. I ordered a Combo for lunch. 1/2 Italian Sandwich + house salad. Sandwich was a little weird...when I picked it up it dripped juice?? Sandwich was fresh however. House salad was good & so was the dressing. I'd change the apple to something other than the Mackintosh they served. Apple was a little \"mealish\"."}
{"text":"I place and order for pick up for 6 people at work. First they didn't put in the bag 3 soups . I call and i was told that they run out of the tomato soup. Nobody told me that there was no more tomate soup they just didn't put in the  bag but they still charged me for them. We spend over $80 and the order side were too small, missing soups and I had to go back to pick up the rest of the order.. not a good place to come back."}
{"text":"Food is always good... eating area is dirty! 
Tables need bussing and wiping down. Place isn't even busy. Get it together Boca Park Panera!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. I usually always order 'u pick 2' for lunch. Today I tried the cherry pastry which I really took time to enjoy - panera's dessert pastries are usually a little on the stale side. I always get the green tea! I love it & always refill before heading out. Service is friendly during the day - I've never been at night..."}
{"text":"Almost in tears after the amazing individual, Rosemary that I received service from tonight. One person at a time society is going to have to go in a more polite & peaceful direction. People like the employees I have encountered here today prove that can happen. Btw, the kale & romaine salad is tasty! Also don't forget your snickerdoodle..."}
{"text":"Extradinarilly big for a cafe! They've got everything to satisfy your cravings.
I've had their freshly made-on-the-spot signature salad-Thai basil chicken, and cranberry/pop seeds muffins. They are all pretty decent.

Their cookies are buy one get one free for 1.25. They all seem very yummy. 
This is the cafe that combines sweet bakery shop, fresh salad bar, and healthy sandwich shops all in one. Like! The size of it simply put New Yorkers to shame, but they are slightly less tasty than NYC ones specializing in their own niche markets."}
{"text":"Complete rip off!!! So overpriced for what you get.  $6.00 for a puny half a turkey sandwich!!  Then they got my order wrong on top of it.  I will never go back. AZ Bread Company down the road has MUCH better food in terms of quality and quantity as well as better prices!!  Just goes to show, family owned is always better than big chains!!"}
{"text":"Food not good.... Taste like frozen food, bread is cold and hard like a rock. Boca park location is much better! Not recommend! Don't know if going back again!"}
{"text":"I'm a Panera fiend, and this one has a great outdoor seating spot right outside by a huge fountain so location is great, but food was not up to par with other paneras I've been too. I got the apple chicken salad that I always get and the chicken was not so great. They also put the wrong nuts in it, almonds instead of walnuts."}
{"text":"IT has been a consistent slow decline in service and product but I kept trying due to location. But now I am done. The once delicious turkey and cranberry sand which was awful. The bread was horrible with GOBS of cranberry and three paltry pieces of in appetizing turkey. They even served without a cookie! I had to ask for one but when it was served it tasted like it was a day or two old. Same with the lemon poppy seed muffins. They are often DRY and crumbly. So we will take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited for my order over 25 minutes. First they blamed me on not responding when they looked for me which was a lie. Then after remaking my food (another 15 minutes) they made it wrong. Manager tried to get me take the food anyway saying if I don't take it they through it in trash. I had limited time and could not wait another 10-15 minutes for another mistake. Eat at chipotle. Better service and better food."}
{"text":"This Paradise Bakery makes all the others look awful! The people that work there do not even care when customers are around and will just say inappropriate things, its okay with me, BUT NOT IN FRONT OF CHILDREN! I was very offended and they weren't even my kids! This was honestly the last strike! 

The second strike was a HAIR in my fruit salad. I mean, that is just gross and made me wonder why everyone behind the counter weren't wearing hair nets. 

The first strike is they are always out of something or another like edamame! That is what makes the Asian salad! No point in getting it. 

Its a shame that this Paradise Bakery is so awful because it is the closest one to my house! Guess I will have to drive all the way to Scottsdale and 101 if I want Paradise."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a light lunch, especially when you're watching your diet.  I like how they list all of the calorie details on their boards for your information.  Who knew that a creamy tomato soup has more calories than a chicken soup with rice?  If you order drinks, it's a fill your own cup kind of scheme, like the other fast food chains, but their healthier selections include hot and cold teas.

It's surprising how much half a sandwich and a small bowl of soup can fill me up.  I'm happy to be eating regular sized portions at Panera Bread.  I would avoid the chocolate brownies and decadent desserts if you're counting calories though... it wasn't my fault my friend bought one and couldn't finish it!!!"}
{"text":"I am addicted to the 4 cheese souffle (actually all their souffle's).  These are like little quiche type cheese breakfast treat that are only 400-500 calories each and are a good little quick breakfast.  They taste great!  Also like the coffee here and the fact that they have calorie counts right on the menu.  The service is always great here and I come here so much they are starting to know me.  They also have lots of great bagels and other snacks that look delicious.  It is a brand new location with a drive thru and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I count on this place at least once per week. Love that the calorie count is in their menu and the service is usually pretty good. I love their four cheese soufflé.  I would've never tried it but they told me that lots of people love them and that they were pretty popular so I gave it a shot. Also they are constructing a new drive-through at this location probably because the Dunkin' Donuts next-door is always so busy from their drive. Their food is much better than Dunkin' Donuts so I'm sure that they will do well. Superclean and casual inside like many other locations and we can't forget the cookies."}
{"text":"Panera as a franchise is three stars for me, but this location had chilly unwelcoming service, no hi/greeting. After we stood there looking at the menu, the cashier snapped \"can i help you\". Long wait on a coffee when we were the only customers. Coffee was prepared just fine."}
{"text":"I dislike panera to start with. I think it's over priced and under tasted. Lol! 

That said I do like being able to shame free order rapid pick up and select several bakery items and then grab em and go :)

I love their smoothies, and a guilty pleasure of cheese soup in a bread bowl! The service is hit or miss... One gal Nicole is supper nice and friendly. Others don't give two turds. They should offer trays for large orders that done in."}
{"text":"I waited MONTHS for this Panera to open right by my house. I am so happy and thankful that it finally did. The location and store itself is perfect! The employees have always been super nice. 

The reason for the 3 stars is:
1st visit-GREAT!

2nd visit- took 7 mins (I know this because they have a timer where you wait) for a CUP of chili to go. That's really all I got. 

3rd visit- this was the doozy. I got home to discover my salad lettuce was brown. Not only just a little brown, but it actually smelt horrendous it was so old. I spend $14 dollars on my meal when I go there, I expect fresh produce. That's part of the point of Panera. Since I got it to go, I couldn't even get a new salad and just had to eat my half sandwich :( 

Please don't let this location fail! I'm SO happy it's finally here."}
{"text":"service was fair, order was wrong when I got back to work.  quality of sandwich was poor, fatty, forgot the cheese.  won't visit this panera again"}
{"text":"My first Yelp! After spending a lot of time on yelp I have finally become one of you.  I hope the initiation is not too painful or humiliating.

After much deliberation,  Paradise was decided upon for a lunch meeting because of it's free WI-Fi and decent food.  When I arrived, i scoped the place out and found that the only tables that had access to plugs were the ones with uncomfortable chairs, oh well suck it up I say.  I sat down and got a diet coke and waited for my associate to show.  Shortly after sitting and sipping my drink I realized that it was colder than I or any one else could tolerate without dressing like an extra in Fargo.  I went out to my truck and got another short sleeve shirt to cover myself with.  This did nothing.  When my lunch partner showed she gave up one of her hoodies. I put on a much to small sweater and was glad to have it (for a visual, you can check my profile pic.). Slightly disturbing. We were the two svelte people with the hoodies on in case you were wondering.

We then headed up to the line to order some food.  I got the Thai Chicken Wrap and she basically made up her own salad combining three or four different salads into a new concoction.  The salad maker was very accommodating to her and made a pretty mean looking salad.  I was jealous.  The Thai Wrap was anything but impressing. It basically was a combination of sticky sushi style rice with cabbage and sliced chicken, BOOO!  The Thai peanut sauce came on the side and it tasted like Thai peanut sauce. 

The WI-Fi that we came in for was slow! We were doing lots of research that involved streaming media and it could not handle the traffic.  Time was a wasted.  

When the corporate lunch crowd came in it offered a lot of opportunities for people watching. So if you are into to analyzing  what makes the cubicle zombies keep on going then this offers some prime viewing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots. I was so excited when they finally opened a location in Summerlin - however the parking in this area sucks :/

Ordered through their \"rapid pickup\" option while running errands today. It was so easy and convenient. I ordered and paid right on my phone, walked in and within 5 minutes it was ready. This location does have a weird layout but that doesn't bother me, food is always good and service as well :)"}
{"text":"Panera I really like your establishment but it doesn't matter what state I'm in I order a salad and you have the mushiest tomatoes I ever ate... why???"}
{"text":"I've been a handful of time just moving to the area. Everytime I come its horrendous.... first time ordered online went and picked up my order about 15 min before close went home look in the bag missing half the stuff I got. Rolled back in right as they were locking the doors and told them they messed up all the did was make me another small small other half. Have gone through the drive thru and sat for 5 minutes while no one said anything said hello several times nothing ever came out so I parked and walked in... I asked is no one at the drive thru? She looked around lost didn't say a word and asked for our order.. this place has terrible service and never try to compensate for their mistakes. Employees making the food are always horsing around not giving an F how slow they are taking."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite Panera location in North Phoenix.  Sure, their employees are not the friendliest, but I still would drive the 7 miles to go here rather than the 1 mile to go to the Bell Rd/7th St location.

Why?  A couple of things.  First off, the music!!  At the Mall location it is not obtrusive.  It is nice and low, without the crazy obnoxious songs that are played at the Bell Rd location - at an ear-splitting decibel!!  
Secondly, the food is more consistent.  You can expect to get the same amount of turkey in the turkey sandwiches which, by the way, is a LOT more than the Bell Rd. location.

It's just all around a nicer play to eat and chat, read, whatever.  The Bell Rd location does have nicer people though, at least  compared to the few I've dealt with ordering at the Mall location.

(Oh, and at the Mall location you have... the Mall ;-)   A nice place to walk in the summer, although I don't buy much there.  I'm an online purchaser mostly.)"}
{"text":"We used to go here several times a week but we have switched to another location due to several issues we can no longer abide.

First, the good news.  The people who work there are fantastic.  Always friendly and helpful.  They score an A+ for that.  Also, their pastries are great.  However, both these things are pretty standard at any Panera location.

Now for the reasons we switched location (even though it's 6 miles further).  First, coffee......  sometimes good, sometimes really bad (yeah, I don't know how that can happen either, but it's true).  AND lately it's just not HOT enough.  (And I'm not the only one who nukes the coffee, which is ridiculous.)   I want a HOT cup of coffee, not 'pretty hot' or 'very warm', without having to nuke it every time. 

Food is usually good, although not real consistent in the amounts you get.  Also, the breakfast sandwiches are prepared very sloppily.  Sometimes a real mess.  Just slapped together.

Last but not least is the music (in fact, it may be the biggest negative)!!  Yikes!  Ear splitting, which wouldn't be so bad if the music selections were not so bad.  Really, really crappy, annoying music.  And did I say, LOUD???  We go to another location and it is so nice.  You can hardly hear the music, and when you consciously listen, it is calm and relaxing.  It's just background, low key  and relaxing --  not in your face crazy loud.
(The Gainey Ranch location has nice, low, relaxing music too.  But that's Gainey Ranch.... they do it right.)

Would be a great place if the above issues could be resolved.  In the past I have taken those surveys they email to you, and always mention the loud music (my only written critique in those surveys).  I used to dutifully complete them, but I stopped quite a while back when I realized they don't really care.  Nothing has changed -- except the location I now go to!  ;-)"}
{"text":"After getting my order wrong the manager Jennifer was EXCELLENT. Very well customer service, I appreciated her making sure not only to get it right again but giving me a free pastry and checking in on us yet again. I won't go anywhere else. My new Panera as long as Jennifer is here."}
{"text":"Good workers but no management.  Went in to beat the lunch crowd around 11AM, already getting busy, no napkins, I got the last spoon, my date couldn't find Panera Bread because all of the signs say Paradise Bakery, manager says they bought them 10 years ago but not enough time to get the signs change.  Floor really gross needing sweeping at minimum, used a Panera Bread gift card just got from a friend that had $10 on it, cashier tells me it's \"declined\", took about 10 mins and 2 employees to figure it out. If you and your other get different items, she gets a bagel, I get chilli, this is two different registers and separate transaction. Both date and I are massively unimpressed."}
{"text":"Panera is a secret guilty \"chain\" pleasure for me. I honestly love it every time. Their coffee is made fresh hourly, free wifi, and the line is always out the door but moves fast. I like that you can get in and get out fast but not have to eat in the mall food court. 

I recommend the Mediterranean vegetarian sandwich with the Greek salad. Get the 1/2 for $6.99."}
{"text":"This Panera is the perfect place for a business meeting.

I liked that the tables were far enough apart to have a private meeting.  They also have free wi-fi, plenty of plugs, and don't hassel you for staying around after your cup of coffee.  

They don't have table service, but I think that is a positive because no one interupts you."}
{"text":"Good food but overpriced as fuck! If you are looking to send $12 on a light lunch then go for it. If you are really hungry just move along. Thats all you need to know"}
{"text":"Krissy. Extremely nice, friendly wonderful person. Food was amazing also! Thank you for what you do. Loved how cheerful and professional she was! Thanks for starting our morning out right! If I had to say one thing though, the fast lane kiosk at the door make the place look cheap and mediocre."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this location....except the parking because it's in a strip mall with lots of other places so sometimes it can be a lil frustrating to find a space.
Lately I have been ordering online and doing the rapid pick up.  My order is always ready when I arrive and always hot.
I tend to get the pick 2 soup and salad.  It's the perfect size for dinner.
I order a lot of their salads at work for various meetings.  Never had a salad that we didn't like.
Stop on in....."}
{"text":"I came to this location bc I was headed to Henderson to see a friend and she wanted the Pick Two.  I typically go to the location in Summerlin for my Rapid Go Order.
First, the location is very clean. Typically super busy during the lunch hour because of the location being on Howard Hughes Pkwy which is nothing but offices.  
I ordered 2 Pick Twos, wild chicken rice soup and 2 salads.  My kale and Caesar salad did NOT have croutons on it....NONE!  That annoyed me bc I really love those lil cheesy delights.  But of course, I didn't find that out until I was clear in Henderson.  Secondly, their portions seem to be smaller than the Summerlin location that I frequent.  Overall, not a bad location jut disappointed in my croutons and the smaller portions."}
{"text":"This place is pretty fast for delicious healthy food. They have a huge variety and a kids menu. The chicken hummus plate is somewhat deceiving.  It's a salad with s tiny bit of hummus dressing.  Other than the the service was good and quick but pretty pricey. $30 for 3 people to eat 1 item and drinks/cookies/chips not included."}
{"text":"Ordered food as they were closing and received poor service. A bagel was forgotten from our order. And worst of all, the apple in our bag had MOLD growing on it!!!"}
{"text":"This location seems to have a large problem with keeping stock of the few products they sell.  I have early morning Dr appts in the area so I have tried twice around 8:30am in past month to obtain a few plain bagels only to find out they have none and are nearly sold out of every other kind of bagel they have as well and nearly all pastries (not that I like any other kind,  just an observation). Today I actually felt frustrated and asked the cashier if it's a normal thing for them to be sold out of the few products they sell so early on in day?  Her response: \"yea on Tuesdays\". On Tuesdays??  Weird response.  Weekends maybe but a random weekday?  I would understand if this was an issue at 3 in the afternoon since they are open ALL DAY but when you have only been open a couple hours and the issue seems to be you are always sold out management needs to seriously rethink the availability they are putting out every day. You guys only sell a few products,  if they are NEVER available when you have just opened for the day your customers will go elsewhere.  I am currently googling other area locations for different businesses with these products and will take my business elsewhere.  

Highly recommend you do not come to this location of you are looking for breakfast food as you may not find it!  Coffee maybe??  Or sandwiches?  But good luck with that."}
{"text":"Ok. I love Panera and I think I have given this shop a fair try. I have been here 4 times and each time the customer service has been extremely disappointing. The service is beyond slow - and I am ordering items through the app! The first time I went I brought my mom... Both of us have been to Panera before and were super disappointed. The other times I ordered online, I ordered about 20minutes out... I arrived and had to wait an additional 10 plus! While the manager was very nice... The employees... Yikes! Who is training these kids!?!
Please Panera - send someone from corporate to shape this place up!"}
{"text":"This place is garbage. I've been coming here about twice a week for six months. They're the closest to me. I ALWAYS order the same thing and they ALWAYS mess it up. I've given them the benefit of the doubt and even talked to a manager because, come on enough is enough. It's a simple order. I guess since I talked to the manager they know who I am and what I order, yet they still. Constantly. Mess up my order. Just done with this place and don't recommend anyone there either."}
{"text":"Experience:  My friend and I decided to stop in for dinner at this new location. I've been to Panera's all over the country and they have such amazing breads, soups, salads, and sandwiches. It was Wed @6pm. 

Facility:  It's seems to be a bit small compared to other Panera's I've been to, but maybe it's the layout. It was very clean as its a brand new location. 

Service:  Well, I ordered my meal and when I tried to pay, it declined my card. I was using my Discover, which I pay off each month. The attendant ran it again, and said it was declined, I told her that it was definitely not the card. Of course now I'm mortified because everyone in ear shot thinks I don't pay my bills now. The attendant didn't know what to do, so she started to go get the manager. I didn't want to hold up anyone behind me, so I ended up paying with Amex and standing off to the side to call my card company to find out why it was declined. Meanwhile the manager stepped up and I told him how embarrassing the situation was that their machine did not take my card. His answer was that they don't judge people. Really???  There's nothing to judge!!!  Eventually the folks from Discover said there weren't any problems with the card, and said they don't even see the \"declined\". They said they should have manually entered the card number, which of course they did not. 
I mentioned this to the manager too, and he just answered they could have done that. I guess it's just new people, new store, but unfortunately at the expense of my embarrassment. :(  He did say he would mention it to their IT too, but I didn't have confidence he really will. 
He did check on my friend's food and brought her a free piece of bread since they didn't have croutons. That was nice. 
Other than that, the attendant that came by, I think her name was Mykayla, she was a sweetie!  She chatted with us and cleared our plates with a super positive disposition. We really liked her. 

Food:  What can I say...it's Panera!  The food is good. This time I got the pick 2 and a drink, and a plain bagel for tomorrow. 
Winter squash soup - 4/5 - thick, creamy and a tad sweet as squash can be. 
Almond Chicken Salad Sandwich - 3.5/5 - a little too runny, but the flavor was very good. I took one bite and juice went all over. My friend laughed and said it was a tad wet for a chicken salad. Maybe it sat too long and the grapes and celery sweat a little too much. It still tasted good. 
Bread - 5/5 - they have the best bread ever!!!  Crispy on the outside, soft and delicious on the inside. LOVE!!!

Overall: Panera is always one of those spots I will return no matter how the service is, because it's just Yum!  Although, if I ever have a credit card issue at this particular spot again, I'll avoid this spot and go to one of the others in town."}
{"text":"I've dined at this location a couple of weeks ago and all was great! My half Chicken Napa Almond Sandwich stood tall next to my Soba Noodle Chicken Bowl with a French Baguette. They get 4-stars for their service, but -1 star for forgetting my treat that I ordered, which I reminded them of. Panera's food quality is good. It is a cafe style sort of food menu. Their baked treats are yummy and the fruit drinks are delightful.

This 3-Star review is based on the delivery service from an order I placed on their website for myself, my coworker, and boss. The online ordering went smooth and each order was clear enough to see who owed what on the receipt.

The delivery said 30-45 minutes, but ended up taking an hour. The tracker that Panera links you to had the driver at one location spot for awhile and then had them hopping to my delivery point and back to where they had started from. I wasn't sure what was going on but I figured that maybe they had to get gas or were rerouted due to construction/convention across the street. When they finally made it to my delivery point, the delivery woman, Charmane, was apologetic for not being on time, which I accepted her apology as I'm sure there are unknown rerouting issues or maybe navigation threw her off. But no, her reasoning was because she had to deliver frozen drinks to another location which was off the route to my delivery point. Understandable, but that's unfortunate that frozen drinks received priority over my order and pushed the time which ran into my boss' meeting time. NOTE TO SELF that I guess next time order frozen drinks so I become first on the delivery list.

Everything we ordered was in the bag. The only food item I was not pleased with is my Half Napa Almond Chicken sandwich because it was smashed. I'm sure it was because it was in the bag squeezed next to the other sandwich that was ordered and next to the bag of soups. May have been smashed, but it was still delicious!

I will be returning to dine-in this location again in the future because the service was great and the food quality is wonderful. As for delivery, I'll just have to either pick-up or have food delivered knowing it may go over the estimated time given from Panera. Delivery woman was very kind though."}
{"text":"Food is always good and fresh! I love the drive-thru! :)"}
{"text":"I am OK with this location, I don't know why the rating is fairly low. In terms of the place being a part of a chain, I think this is at the top of that chain. I've definitely been to Panera's that I did not like. Friendly, good location. What more do you want? You can't expect the best gourmet foods you've ever had. 


The bathroom could've been cleaner though... I will say that."}
{"text":"This location is fairly clean and friendly.  The food is always tasty, but a bit over-priced for portion sizes.  The drink station tends to be well stocked.  The only real issue I have with the place is that they share a parking lot with McDonald's which sometimes feels like trying to park in the middle of a racetrack."}
{"text":"Ordered an asian sesame chicken salad to go. It took a very long time. Salad wasnt as good as it usually is because it was missing cilantro. If i pay 8 bucks for a salad i expect it to be made right."}
{"text":"Southwest Term C Phx airport by gate c17

Tonight 6.7.Panera 9:22 pm closed. I asked why \"cause my manager says close we close\" customers were coming for orders including myself. I ordered at 921 pm. 7 employees gathered out front and hung out. 12 employees on staff and we close early turning away customers with a full staff. Must be costing a fortune.   I, however, have been waiting for my panini for over 15 min as employees hang out wow!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service from Sky. Came in this morning and they didn't have soup yet. Came in at dinner time and they were out of bread bowls. She was super snotty about it when we came in this evening. Then, didn't even fill my daughters mac and cheese half way yet we paid like $5 for it. Oh and it was barely warm. Really crappy visit all around. First world problems, I know, but seriously it's not tough to smile and be decent."}
{"text":"Nope. No thanks. Never again. 

What a poor food experience. Ordering is simple: either order at the kiosk if you have a credit card or go to the cashier if you have cash. 

Once you order your name is called and your food arrives. Simple. I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese which is made in their \"kitchen\". What goes on there I'm not sure, because heating food isn't one of them.

My sandwich was cold. Cold cheese. Cold egg. Cold. Have you ever had a cold breakfast sandwich and enjoyed it, probably not. The bacon was chewy as if it wasn't actually meat and the bread was not fresh.

The lemon cookie was a redeeming portion of my sorry breakfast.

And sadly because you're running to catch a flight you can't go back and complain so I just ate cold food and was on my way.

Let me save you the trouble. If this is your only option- just stay hungry."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Panera I've ever had. I came in around closing time to get some dinner and ordered chicken noodle soup and Mac and cheese. The girl there told me there was no chicken noodle soup which was fine so I got broccoli cheddar. When I received my meal the broccoli cheddar was a larger portion because I believe she felt bad. The customer service was pretty great however the food was the opposite. The broccoli cheddar was okay but what really got me upset was the Mac and cheese. It was probably microwaved because the bowl was hot yet the cheese was cold and the noodles were a chewy crunchy texture. I am very displeased with this Panera and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great location, clean, friendly workers, with lots of pastry options! Went here today with my friends during our lunch break and we ordered for rapid pick up @ noon. We arrived about 20 minutes early and the manager was very attentive. He tried to get our food ready early but was no able to so he upgraded our 1/2 sandwiches to full size completely on the house! Totally an unexpected and pleasant surprise when we picked up our food. That is just excellent customer service in my opinion"}
{"text":"The line was a little long, but I went when it was a rainy day  so I guess everyone is in a soup mood when it's chilly out. This place is never a disappointment for me I always leave satisfied!"}
{"text":"Ever since this changed from Paradise to Panera I will drive the extra 20 minutes to go to a location that is still Paradise. Employees are rude and don't know the menu, no customer service everything is digital. May as well be a drive thru."}
{"text":"This is where I come when I need to study, but am sick of studying at home. It's a solid location and fairly easy to get to. I have 2 complaints: 1 parking can be a hassle if you come during rush hour. And two the line confusion. Theoretically you all line up between the black rales and then get called up to either the bakery side or lunch side (you can order from both). My issue is you can't really see the menu so you have to get out of line to decide what you want then get back in. 
Oh well, the good
1. Consistent free Internet
2. Really nice workers, yes they're young but very polite and competent. For instance, I asked one kid who said it was his 3rd day workings, where all the plugs were. He didn't know...but then he went around the store and came back to tell me exactly all the spots I could sit for one. How nice is that?!
3. Good, fresh quality food. They're removing all artificial flavors from food(yes!)
4. I like the cinnamon bagel with hazel nut cream cheese for breakfast, and a fresh coffee, and for lunch I enjoy the Greek salad with garden greens."}
{"text":"This is the hardest Panera to find and get to in all of Charlotte.  You have GPS and a smartphone.  Every animal instinct tells you this is all wrong.

This is the Bermuda Triangle and there is no straight path to the Panera.  You can be so close and hopelessly get lost.

Why does this all matter?  If there is any issue with your carry out order then you need to adult your way back to the hardest to find Panera.

I have had issues with this Panera.  My orders are on the explicit side, but at 10usd for a salad you are going to have to earn it.  I don't pay that much for some basic salad the way Panera intended it, I Frankenstein that salad into a mashup of complicated deliciousness."}
{"text":"Oh Panera how much do I love thee? I've been visiting Panera bread for over 10 years(at multiple locations) This location has been my particular Panera home for almost a year now. Parking here is not THE BEST because its a smallish lot with a dozen little shops! Especially during lunch time there is alot of traffic in the lot. 

My usual goto is the the u pick 2 I get 1/2 the frontega chicken and a bowl of broccoli and cheddar soup. You get to choose an apple, french baguette, or kettle chips. Their french baguette is awesome especially when you're lucky enough to get it warm! Their chips are a solid option as well. When they introduced the cuban panini as an option I was a convert this sandwich is awesome ham, chicken, pickle, cheese, and mustard YUM!! I'll get the tortilla soup when I get the cuban, they compliment each other pretty well. 

SOMETHING TO AVOID I stopped in recently and tried the big kid grilled cheese it boast gruyere, vermont white cheddar, american, and applewood bacon. What I was served was a sandwich with lite grill marks and unmelted cheese. So I asked them to, you know, GRILL my grilled cheese! So they did! When I got it back it was sorta mushy maybe like the nuked it in a micro, but it was still a little crispy so I'm not positive it was that but the cheese was NOT visible slices like it was when I first got it. I really LOVE grilled cheese k but this was SO BLAND! It was the texture of grilled cheese without the complex flavors of the above mentioned cheese! And the bacon????? WHERE WAS THE BACON!?! It's as if they sprinkled 3 little sprinkles of bacon bits on this thing! Bacon is usually and a KEY flavor when added to something, not in this sandwich I didn't taste it AT ALL. So for this sandwich alone I did knock a star off =(

Now on to the sweet! They have a special if you get lunch or dinner and a drink you can choose any baked goof for 99 cents. The cobble stone muffin is AWESOME and then their scones! Oh my lord their strawberries and cream scone made me wanna scream at starbucks! When I order this I was expecting something hard and crumbly like starbucks' and what I received was perfectly frosted on the outside and SOFT AND CHEWY on the inside OMG this thing is to die for!! It had chunks of strawberries in it and isn't over poweringly sweet! This is a solid choice TRY IT!!!"}
{"text":"Always a great local cafe for a study session or meeting a friend for coffee 

Only issue I always have is that there are never enough seats if you go in a larger group - pretty crowded on weekends 

Recommend getting the pick two with the broccoli cheddar soup!"}
{"text":"they are terrible!! stay away.....no attention to detail.....
special instructions not followed on 4 of my sandwiches... And the final special instructions NOT followed."}
{"text":"This particular location is very slow, some of the managers are snotty and they almost always screw up my to go orders. They also have different policies than Washington. If I ask for cheese on a sandwich peters twp manger claims I have to be charged for two slices of cheese but Washington either doesn't charge me or only charges for one slice. Get it together !  Usually they forget something in my to go order like my side or give me BBQ sauce instead of salad dressing. I prefer to go to the Washington location instead."}
{"text":"I really like Panera for flavorful vegetarian options.  The Met. Vege sandwich on fluffy wheat bread is so delicious!  Pair any sandwich with a unique beverage:  I like the lemonade, green tea, and smoothies - and you can get a pastry for $1!  I had a healthy, filling, fun lunch for $11 - including dessert!  Value, fast, quality, and delicious.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I have tried Panera Bread previously, but it was my first time trying out this location. The staff was nice and service was quick. 

I ordered the chicken tortellini Alfredo, a side of broccoli cheddar soup, and an iced chai tea latte. The pasta was better than expected and Panera has one of my favorite broccoli cheddar soups so that's always a must order whenever I visit. 

I recommend signing up for their rewards program because you can redeem some of their sweet desserts!"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Panera bu this drive through must be the worst. Sat in line for about 10 minutes then at the window they said my order was never received. This was a complete waste of time. This, coupled with employee rudeness was enough to fire me up beyond belief. Seriously, even McDonald's does better. I left with no food, no resolution, no satisfaction. Think twice before stopping here."}
{"text":"I wish that they didn't change everything when they changed names from Paradise bakery to Panera. I went here with my husband the other day and ordered a salad. That salad usually comes with green goddess dressing on it. I'm not a fan of sweet dressing as I find it to be sweet. I asked for ranch and was informed that they don't offer it Very disappointed. I miss Paradise bakery. Not a fan of Panera!"}
{"text":"I order a baked potato soup and a French onion soup. Received two baked potato soups and the containers were only about halfway full. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Placed a catering order Friday for a Saturday mid-morning pick up.  Arrived to find that oops, they hadn't made the order.  They seemed really disorganized, but did agree to deliver the order when they finally had it assembled.  That happened about an hour later.

My last catering order from this location included two trays of stale brownies.  Won't be ordering from Panera again."}
{"text":"I have been to numerous Panera Breads and the service is normally great but the experience I had at this location was unprofessional. I simply and clearly ordered an Iced Caffe Latte with light ice and a shot of vanilla syrup and the lady looked at me like I was dumb and tried adding an extra shot of espresso but I had to correct her. As I picked up my drink I noticed that the cup was filled up with ice, without making a big deal I just asked for a spoon so that I can remove some ice myself so that my drink doesn't water down. As I asked the gentleman for a spoon he gave me a similar look as the lady who took my order and just tossed the spoon on the counter and said, \"Here homie\". The service here was not welcoming and the staff was rude."}
{"text":"Upon arrival of This establishment I had high hopes! I seen their commercials on the web and was impressed. when I entered Panara bread it was pretty busy I arrived around 6pm on a Sunday  if your curious,I then walked over to the registers and their was no staff.. for about 10 seconds I waited and was then greeted by a nice cashier who serviced me greatly I placed my order I then looked for a table but upon looking at the first table I came across it was not so clean... when I entered Panara bread I noticed the staff were wiping down this particular table I was a little taken back that it was not so clean their was still crumbs on the seats of the table it looked as if the they wiped up quickly and really didn't care I took it as a lazy employee doing half ass work... Anyways I was notified within ten minutes of placing my order that my food was done I was told to have a great day with a smile from another staff that was not my cashier which was very nice. I then proceeded to walk out to my car I then buckled my daughter in her car seat when I presume the manager called me by my first name and stated I'm sorry but we forgot your sandwich he apologized and wished me a good day. I then went home and ate the food I ordered for myself and my girlfriend. She claimed she liked it but she didn't seem impressed now I ordered their version of chicken Alfredo. When I opened the packaging and had my first glance I was not impressed it appeared to me that the chicken in the Alfredo was not cooked along with the Alfredo it self it had no sauce on any of the chicken and had a bit of a pinkish color to it;/ the taste was horrendous. the meat tasted like turkey not chicken their was no chicken mixed in just sprinkled on top from appearance and after my first bite I noticed that some of the noodles I guess you can call it didn't appear to be cooked all the way it had a raw look to it...disgusting! never again will I go back to Panara bread I had to throw the food out to prevent from getting sick! Their customer service is outstanding but if your going for food be warned you may have food poisoning in your future good luck."}
{"text":"This is my second poor experience with this Panera. They were so disorganized. Employees were rude to customers. Probably my last trip to this one. I'll drive across town to the other location."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Convenient for a quick lunch for sure but like the other reviews the portions are small for what you pay for! I've been to the Panera Breads in the USA and the portions are much bigger of course. The service was good I guess. There isn't much to say. They serve your food and clean up after you. This location was clean but it got very packed during the lunch hour. The half sandwich and half soup - beware. You are paying for literally half the price of the sandwich and soup. So my meal was very pricey since I ordered an expensive 'half' sandwich. Tried their steak and arugula sandwich and it was decent. I was expecting a hot sandwich but it was cold sliced steak. Their broccoli and cheddar soup is good I must admit. I also got a signature hot chocolate. Might skip this one next time. Overall for what I paid ($17.50) for my whole meal - not worth it!"}
{"text":"During the handful of times I have come to this Panera, I have found the service to be extremely slow.. there are about three registers but only one staff working.. and while one customer was making a big (or very complicated order).. holding up the line, staff seemed to pace back and forth busily but refusing to serve the next in line. When finally served, I had to repeat my order three times... third time being as the staff went to get my bakery items..she forgot one of the two things I ordered.

The food here is decent.. but the prices are above average. The coffee prices are about the same as Starbucks but you can get refills here (self serve).. they brew a fresh batch quite often. The hazelnut coffee is my favourite. There is a large variety of fresh scones, pastries, muffins, bagels, bread.

Make sure to sign up for the Panera rewards.. as upon registering you get a free surprise loaded onto your card..and once in a while you get free coffee and treats.

This place seems to quite busy most of the time... at least 70% capacity on a Monday afternoon."}
{"text":"The best part about this location is the turn-around times due to the 30 mins of free wi-fi. Guests come in, grab a coffee/pop & bear claw...and then leave after they're done. They have a ton of seating upstairs (air-conditioned), and if you come in after the morning rush, you'll have no problems getting really good service and decent food (yes, it's a little over-priced, but you are at YDSquare)"}
{"text":"Really like this location. The staff has always been nice regardless of the time of day I've gone. I really like their menu and believe they have the best rewards program of any restaurant I frequent. It's very easy to get freebies and considering I stop by at least once a week, they come quicker than what I can often keep up with and have long expiration dates. 

I love their pick 2 deal. My favorite combination is the Mediterranean Chicken Flatbread Sandwich and the Chicken Alfredo Tortellini. Very light meal but also fulfilling. It come with a side of ( your  choice) French bread, kettle chips or apple. It's actually quite a lot of food for under $12. A little pricey for what I would like to pay but the food really is good."}
{"text":"I just starting really enjoy going to Panera Breads. I was originally not a fan of their food but thanks to my co workers, I really like dropping by for a nice lunch.

They have a large variety of foods to select from for all meals if the day and even snack. I am a fan of their strawberry chicken salad and Asian chicken salad. However, the only salad dressing I care for is the dressing that comes with the Asian chicken salad. I think the other dressings are far too tangy. 

This specific location is great because it's easy access for people who do not drive but leave in the area. There are plenty of buses that makes stops directly in front of the restaurant . One thing that I do wish for is them adding more outlets. I like to sometime  bring work and my laptop with me when I dine inside. However, thy have hardly any outlets for charging electronics.  Because of that, I often leave earlier than I would like because my battery starts to run low. This could be done on purpose from Paneras end because they don't want people to overstay their visit as finding seats can be problematic. They do offer free 2 hour service wifi. If too many people are connected, you may get booted or have extremely slow service.


I really would give them a 3 stars. I reserve  4 & 5 stars to high end restaurants only but I really do enjoy their food and beverages. Good spot!"}
{"text":"I am a little confused by the reviews. 
I come here every week with my friends and I have never been disappointed. 
Food is delicious, only negative is that I think everything is a bit overpriced! 
But I pay for it because like i said I love the food!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious, healthy and fairly priced. The staff is friendly and your order is fulfilled quickly. There is plenty of seating and the atmosphere is nice. When you place your order, they will give you a number to place on your table for the food to be delivered. You can also place an order to go which is also fulfilled fast. I usually choose 2 items from their pick 2 menu, like a chicken noodle soup and a half sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is always busy. Food is always fresh and delicious. My favorite is the Thai chicken salad. This particular location needs more seating. At lunchtime it's hard to find anywhere to sit."}
{"text":"My tuna sandwich was the smallest and worst sandwich I've ever had. I called to complain about it and they told me next meal is on us. I'm not even sure if I would eat there for free."}
{"text":"Mediocre food at pretty high prices!  Just paid $11.50 for half a chicken panini and half salad. The panini should be called 'essence of chicken' panini because it was all bread and only a bit of chicken. There are too many good choices around to spend this kind of money for mediocre food.  Should have gone elsewhere. Only good thing is that it's very quick."}
{"text":"Ordered the blueberry bagel with blueberry cream cheese 3 separate times, lightly toasted. Each time the bagel was sooo burnt. Twice they gave regular cream cheese with my order(requested blueberry). When I pointed out my issue, I was questioned if I had ordered right. Even though receipt showed my correct order. This place is so, so. Just make sure you repeat your order at least three times! Also request a light toasting for your bagel."}
{"text":"It's the same Panera food you've had before.  I like the other ones better as they are often  faster at preparing food than this one.  That said the food is fine and the staff is nice enough.

They have warm cookies for $2.00.  That is a nice feature."}
{"text":"Well, I've heard a lot about this place.  The smell when you enter is outstanding.  I love the smell of bakeries.  The service was pretty good, so there are no complaints there.

My rating reflects my growing consternation of chains.  They can offer amazing sounding food, but it all seems to be, somehow, generic.  Panera bread is not that bad, in the end.  My biggest problem with most chains is that they tend to make portions sized for the average army unit, not soldier, unit.  I ordered the Chicken Frontega sandwich, well, half of it.  It was the size of a regular sandwich, yet was considered half size.  The flavour was satisfactory, yet lacked any real distinction.  I also had the garden vegetable soup in Bread bowl.  This, too, was enormous.  The soup was good enough, but, once again, lacked any real distinction in flavour.  It was simply vegetable soup, like all the rest.  My wife had the white cheddar macaroni & cheese.  That was good.  Then again, it's hard to get mac and cheese wrong, especially when compared to the usual KD.  

Would I go back?  I can't really say I would.  I've tried it and found it OK.  That's about the best I can offer."}
{"text":"After having probably the worst customer experience the last two times by way of rude employees, I told myself I will give this place one more chance then they're done. This morning a simple breakfast sandwich with a pre-made croissant, Pre-made eggs, and pre-cooked bacon Took over 20 minutes.

It appears management is non-existent and employees very under trained in customer service. Mark this location off my list of options."}
{"text":"Shocked by the shape this Panera is in. I used to love this location as I live in Highland Heights. The last few times we have been in the was a distinct difference in the entire atmosphere. Manager smirks and giggles with employees while making sandwiches. No line yet it took 10 minutes to get 2 sandwiches made not to mention the fact that we waited for someone to come from the back to help us in the first place. Place looks shabby and is need of a good cleaning. Employee overall would be nice too. We will go to the Panera on Mayfield Rd from now on. Something tells me this happens a lot these days."}
{"text":"The baguettes were soft and fresh however the double chocolate brownie was hard and stale. The French Onion soup came without any croutons or cheese. How is that possible? I hope this isn't a reflection of the overall quality of this Panera and that this was just an aberration. I have come to expect better so this trip was rated as disappointing."}
{"text":"Panera is one of my favorite breakfast places. This particular location was nothing amazing but i will probably be back since it's usually not too crowded in the afternoons. Just wish they'd serve all the breakfast items till a little later than 11am.
Love their hazelnut coffee. Can't go wrong with free refills. 
Could improve on the lighting though, seemed a little dark inside even during daytime."}
{"text":"Pretty much like every Panera I've been to. (Not that I've been to many as it's not my favorite place to eat. However, there was a time when a club I belonged to frequented a specific Panera for meetings.)

Inside looks the same as the others. What's annoying is how some of the tables (versus the booths) protrude too far into the aisles and make the place feel crowded. Not comfortable.

If you're wearing a full length coat, carrying a purse bigger than your hand, or have your laptop, do NOT sit at one of the small rectangular tables. The chairs feel low which means you will need to hang your coat JUST SO on the back of the chair, so your coat doesn't drag the floor. The table is too small for anything other than your meal/drink and maybe a book. 

If there are are at least two in your party, pray for a booth. 

The parking at this location isn't the best. The lot is right off of a main road and is shared with a few other businesses. I felt endangered and confused when parking and leaving."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about the way the management at this location handled an issue we had.  Other business owners should take notes.   I ordered rapid pick up this morning because a family member is in the hospital so we were taking lunch for everyone.  When my sister went to pick up, the order wasn't ready.  After waiting for half an hour, my sister told the manager she had to go because we had to be at Presby.   Not only did the manager offer to have someone deliver the order all the way to the hospital, but also refunded us for the entire $90 order AND added in extra cookies to our order.  

The food was all good and well packaged but the service response earned them 5 stars.  Thank you to management for having a heart and handling this how you did."}
{"text":"This location is on point during lunch. Sometimes there are no tables available but the service is well. The food is tasty but a little pricey. It's nice to go once and a while and has perks if you sign up for their membership. If you are one to judge a place but the cleanliness of its floor, don't look down. Their breads are freshly baked everyday."}
{"text":"Okay Panera someone on your supply chain logistics team must have made avocado supply a priority after my review and complaints. Each order since my last review has had plenty of avocado, which is great because I am mildly obsessed with it. Can you ever have too much avocado? 

The real reason for the updated review is the delivery service and online ordering system in general. Even though I take lunch early (I wait all morning for it to be 11:00am and therefore an acceptable time to leave my desk for lunch) the lines at Panera could be pretty rough. With the new online ordering option I easily place my order on the website. I can customize my item and the price and calorie count is clearly marked. The rapid pick up means the order is already neatly packaged when I arrive and I can just grab and go. I am afraid that one day someone will see my delicious order and swipe it from the counter before I get there but it hasn't happened yet. 

On one of my recent visits they offered a half off coupon for the first delivery which I took full advantage of. The delivery man showed up early and all my food was still hot upon arrival! The $3 normal fee for delivery isn't too bad considering they will bring you a single order. However, since my office is a little over 5 minutes away I will probably save the money and just go get it myself since the rapid to go function has always worked out so well. 

Pro tip - when you order online you can do a bunch of customizations that I didn't know were possible. With a couple substitutions you can turn the smoked turkey sandwich into the sierra turkey sandwich and save yourself a few cents. Also if you haven't tried their new broth bowls yet you are missing out."}
{"text":"Dropped by this afternoon (9/18/17) around 2pm to grab some late lunch. I used the ordering kiosk which is a fantastic invention to get a Green Goddess Cobb salad and a tea. I found a table and my food came out in just a couple minutes. The woman who delivered my meal was pleasant. 

The salad I ordered looked horrible and sat in a messy bowl. The ingredients were there but everything was just thrown together. Normally the presentation is nice. Instead of slivers of red onion there were a couple giant slabs of onion (about and inch by two inches in size) and instead of diced cucumber I got a giant slice of cucumber skin. While I did end up eating about half the salad I gave up on the drenched, limp lettuce and soggy chicken and avocado. I enjoyed the hibiscus tea.

Note that this restaurant only has white sugar, pink packets, and their version of Splenda. Most Panera restaurants offer a stevia option but not here."}
{"text":"Girl at the front was amazing and did her job. 

I received my steak sandwich with double meat frozen twice. 

I was very sick so I had my boyfriend complain the first time. Someone brought out a new sand which that hat hot bread with even colder almost frozen meat inside. After the second time I did the complaining. I had a complete meltdown. I was looked at by the kitchen staff like omg what? No one said anything. The girl at the front was empathizing with me and told me she understood. I had her touch the sand which with her finger. She acknowledged it was frozen. I told them I want my money back. 

A very unhappy looking manager came out of the back. Didn't say one word to me, just if I had paid cash or credit. He gave me cash refund with a receipt that says \" Accuracy matters. Your order should be correct every time. If it's not, will fix it right away, and give you a free treat for your trouble. Just let an associate know. \"


I was offered 2 frozen sandwiches and a refund. I am very hurt by this company now and am afraid to return."}
{"text":"Great place to ger coffee, food and try to
Limit dinner here.
I mix their dark roast with hazelnut., seriously good flavor Coffee. Bagels ofcourse, most of them come there for that. Good all round food, good ambience., crowded at 11:30 and things settle down after 8:45 in the morning."}
{"text":"I enjoy the new rapid pickup feature but every other time they've gotten an order wrong so just make sure you check it before you leave. Like some places, they are out of a lot things the hour before they close so I suggest going earlier. Staff has always been friendly. Sign up for their app and earn rewards."}
{"text":"Customer service is very mediocre. This has happened twice now, where I've called to ask if they have a particular soup i like, that they only have on certain days, and both times the lady i talked to said they have it. 

When i got there, they rung it up for me, only to tell me later that they didnt have it available that day, so i got my money back and had to go somewhere else.

I dont know how hard it is to check or if the employee both times just did not care enough to look, but because of that i definitely recommend a different Panera or different place to eat altogether."}
{"text":"I really like the food at paradise bakery (my favorite is the turkey cranberry on molasses bread and the crumbly blue salad) but I can only give this location three stars because so many of the employees are just rude! They put the salads together and hand it to you without saying a word, and if you ask for extra of something they snatch the bowl back rudely and hand it back with no more than a dirty look. Also, there is always something off about their soda machine! Either it's too much carbonation or too much syrup.  Sort of annoying..."}
{"text":"Probably the most over-rated sandwich/soup restaurant I've ever been to. Ordered the French-onion soup, which was way too salty. Also ordered the grilled cheese, which wasn't grilled properly (and had burnt edges), and the processed cheese looked like it was thinly spread cheese-wiz. Everything was completely over-priced for the quality of food they serve."}
{"text":"Sorry - other then their cookies - I'm still not impressed with this chain. This location wasn't any different then most others - fairly clean, which I like - staff decent and friendly - selection exactly the same as all other locations and certainly somewhere I am not afraid to go to - it just doesn't excite me the way it does others!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today, never been... so I figured I'd give it a try. Ordered a breakfast power sandwich(ham, eggs, and cheese on multi grain), no cheese and a coffee. It came out with cheese, risking being uncomfortable for the next few hours from eating the dairy(lactose intolerant) I ate it anyways. Ate it cause I don't like sending food back, am fearful of what may happen to it after sending it back.  Sandwich was good but nothing special. Checked my receipt, cashier did not put on the ticket \"no cheese\", so definitely not the kitchen's fault. Nothing special or spectacular here, but an alternative to paradise bakery."}
{"text":"This place has a great location but the have constantly missed the mark on order accuracy.  In some cases I ordered online and didn't realize that my order was incorrect until I arrived at home (very frustrating)!!

The restaurant has great seating indoors and out, appears clean and staff is friendly (although slow).

The last time I was there my wife and I both experienced issues with our orders. I wish there was a closer restaurant..may have to start trying Jason't Deli."}
{"text":"I never used to like Panera. At all.

I gave Panera another shot after so long last year. If you're picky about your food though, I wouldn't come here. Most of their food has a ton of ingredients. I always forget what I order every time I come here, but it's a turkey/ham sandwich with some orange sauce on the bread. It's delicious.

The service hasn't really been good though. Especially when you pick up your food, everyone has a \"I want to leave\" look on their face. Panera is also very open when it comes to seating."}
{"text":"It's a shame that this location is run so terribly. I live in the neighborhood and EVERY time myself or my husband go into this location our order is messed up (which is generally a pretty straight forward bagel). On top of that the customer service is awful, the employees are rude and completely unattentive. Can't wait for Lucy's to go in right around the corner at least there on he rare occasion they screw your order up, they are happy to fix their mistake instead of rolling their eyes as if it were your issue to begin with. If you hate humans get out of the customer service industry because it shows!! There are plenty of great restaurants in this area DO NOT waste your time here!!"}
{"text":"I love panera so much, it is amazing. The cinnamon rolls are the best. Also, you should get the sierra turkey sandwich, it is really good."}
{"text":"Panera Bread is one of the only chain restaurants that has never disappointed me. They serve up some awesome comfort food including soups,  sandwiches,  macaroni and cheese as well as baked goods. You can get some decent breakfast grub here too I've heard though I haven't tried their breakfast menu first hand.  If you're looking for an inexpensive quick meal this is a great spot.  If you come around lunch time there's usually a good sized crowd so be prepared to wait a little.  

The customer service has been really great at this location both times I've visited.  Once we called in to place an order for the office and I swear I thought the lady was going to hang up with all the questions my Co worker had but she patiently answered every question and placed our multi person,  separate payment orders correctly.  Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"I unfortunately visited this Panera location 7/26/16. I would give them negative 5 stars if that was possible. I had a $10 gift card. It took them three trys to actually credit it to my order. My receipt reads the correct amount, but when I got home the $10 was taken from my account in addition to the original charge. My wife called them the next day and they said they would correct it. They did not. So she went to the store with the receipt and spoke with a very disrespectful Maria. Maria told my wife it was not their fault - that my wife should take it up with our bank. She refused to do a thing even though on the receipt it reads \"Accuracy Matters, Your order should be correct every time. If it's not, we'll fix it right away, and give you a free treat for your trouble.\" We received neither. My wife has since contacted Panera corporate and they were empathetic and said they would refund our $10 - it's the principal now. They have not done so as of 8 hours later. I will never go to any Panera Bread again. Also, the food did not compare to Paneras back East."}
{"text":"I know everyone is excited about the new Panera Bread and are so excited to go there, but save your time and money and go elsewhere.  I ordered an order on-line to save time and went to the drive-thru to pick it up.  After waiting behind several people who were ordering for their entire office (and who weren't asked to wait in the convenient parking stalls next to the drive-thru) I finally got to the front of the line.  Keep in mind when I approached the speaker no one ever told me you had to go inside to pick up your order.  When I got to the window they said my order never came through and to wait in the parking stalls so they could bring it right out to me.  It's 11:20 at this point, and my order was for 11:25 because I had to be somewhere twenty minutes later, hence the on-line ordering.  at 11:30, with time running out, I had to go in to find my order, just to see it sitting on a cubby, completely forgotten.  As I grabbed my order, the girl who promised to bring it out to me laughed and said, \"sorry\" in the most condescending tone I've ever heard.  BUT THAT'S NOT THE LAST OF IT!  When I opened the salad when I got home, it was less than HALF full!  I paid ten bucks for a salad that I could fit in a red solo cup with room to spare!  

Complaints to corporate were useless, so here we are.  All I was told is you don't pick up on-line orders in the drive-thru, basically blaming me for their screw-up.  Um, say what?  How is THAT convenience?  Besides, no signage on the doors, the drive-thru signs OR the website have this information on them, and on that day there were forty high-schoolers in the line that I was supposed to stand in for food I ordered on-line, which would have taken MUCH LONGER.  The food was sitting in a cubby RIGHT BESIDE THE DRIVE-THRU WINDOW!  Needless to say I won't be returning to this location.  I will instead be going to Newk's, where I can get a great salad for a great price, and actually GET a salad that is worthy of the money I spend!  Yes, it's a lot further out, but I'd rather go there and get quality food instead of wilted lettuce and an attitude problem."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service is beyond poor! The cashier was so rude! She threw the rolls in our to go sack with no wrapper of any kind. Just threw them in the sack. We are regular customers but I'm not sure how much longer I can take the poor service."}
{"text":"Well I have never been to Panera before, decided to give it a go because I miss Paradise. It was a little odd when I first walked in and you order on a kiosk, I think I prefer a human, but it does seem to make the process quicker. I ordered the baked potato soup and the southwestern salad with ginger hibiscus tea. The soup was hot and fresh, creamy and tasty I did enjoy it. My salad, was crisp, flavorful I wish I had extra dressing though cause it was a bit dry. My tea I loved it! I would come back just for the tea! It was a tad pricey about over 16 bucks and I was alone."}
{"text":"Cesar is very nice and helpful. He is a good manager. Great customer service. The food is good here. I will return again."}
{"text":"I used to come here many times a week when it was Paradise Bakery, now it's Panera and not quite the same. The prices went up, and I swear my salads just aren't as big now. They also had some employee turn-over because the Paradise employees were always super friendly and \"knew\" a regular customer. 

     Today I got the Fuji Apple salad, to go, it took about 10 minutes ( I wasn't in hurry). It was good, I really liked the chicken and crunchy sweet dried apple chips, but ya, my salad looked small. I used to be able only to eat half of it, not this time! Overall it wasn't completely terrible, but I'm going to give some of the other restaurants a try."}
{"text":"Yet again panera has won the fight...todays battle ..two soups...a small and large salad and a half sandwich..the clam chowder was missing clams and veggies...basically it was cream broth....the chedder broccoli tasted like it was burned...so soups went to the fishes....my fiance added avacado to her salad and  got 1 piece of avacado for a large salad....my small salad was ok.. my sandwich was ok as well...my only complaint there was the gallon of mayo they put on it... hate to say it but we will probably be back because its fresh"}
{"text":"Panera Bread is one of my favorite go-to places for lunch, especially when I am out of town and not familiar with what other lunch options are available.  Panera trumps any of the fast food places.  They make your order fresh and it is always good."}
{"text":"I came to this Panera tonight to finish up a paper for my Master's program. I needed a place where I could spread out all my papers and books, use free wi-fi, and grab occasional sustenance. I worked for 5 hours! And in that time, I ordered 2 different times, received exactly what I ordered in a very timely fashion, and the manager even came by to check on me - but not in a \"You can't sit here all day!\" way.  He was just asking if I was a teacher (I am) or a student (I am). He was very friendly and told me stay as long as I wanted - until they close at 10, that is :) About an hour later, he came back over with 2 free cookies! I was so happy and appreciative! After hours of typing, reading and typing, his kindness meant so much! At about 9, staff started cleaning, and I'd had enough so I packed up. The young lady who'd been vacuuming smiled as I left and told me to have a good night. Not once did I feel like anything but a valued customer. I love Panera for the food but will return because of the customer service!"}
{"text":"Girls are very rude at drive thru was told they didn't accept $100.00 bills and found out they did 
They have attitudes including the manager act like your bothering them when you order"}
{"text":"I have never been graced with such human kindness. I had a tooth extracted today. And I ordered the wrong soup. Crista, got me what I wanted and also sent me home with extra broth and yogurts. Really made sure I was accommodated. She is amazing and made my first experience a great one. I will be frequenting this establishment!!! Thanks christa!!!"}
{"text":"I just went here for lunch it is in a convienent location being right across from the hotel I am staying in and I haven't had Panera since there isn't one in Reno, NV. 

The place was very busy when I walked in, but the like was moving quickly. The staff was friendly and efficient getting people orders quickly to make the line move. 

I ordered a you pick two consisting of the Green Goddess Salad and the Tomato Mozz Flatbread, to go. 

When I got back to my hotel room I noticed that the portions were a good size, the salad was delicious and stocked with veggies. The dressing is remarkable for this salad the taste of avocado basil is present and really adds to the salad. 

The Tomato Mozz Flatbread was ok. The pesto made it very flavorful, but with each bite more and more juice would drip out. It was very messy. I think if rather it on a thicker piece of bread to soak up that run-away flavor."}
{"text":"Wanted some chicken soup this evening and, despite the negative reviews, decided to pick some up here.

Location is a new development on Williams Field just west of Santan. Easy access.

The restaurant itself looked modern, nice and clean but it did have an unpleasant smell ... not too strong but very noticeable.  Maybe a dirty mop?

Staff were VERY friendly.

Ordered, Paid and picked-up the soups to go.

Soup itself was hot and yummy, as was the baguette."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm one of the few people who wasn't a big fan of the switch from Paradise Bakery to Panera, but of the locations that I've been to this is the one I like the best. Granted, I used to come there A LOT when it was PB, and (at least at first) they had a lot of the same friendly staff that made the transition pretty smooth. 

One thing I really liked better about PB were the pastries. Although I don't think the ones here are AS good they taste a lot fresher than some of the other new Paneras I've been to, which is good. Also, I greatly appreciate that they always offer the $0.99 pasty upgrade with meals. I know this is a regular thing, but it seems like most other locations ignore it and I think it's a great deal. 

They have a similar set-up as the the old PB location, with the exception of the area where you can pick up online orders. I particularly like the back area where it's a little more quiet, and they even have a banquet area which is nice."}
{"text":"In general, I preferred when there were Paradise Bakeries in the Phoenix area, but Panera is still okay (the one thing I actually DO like better are there soups). My main complaint is that the rewards program isn't nearly as good as it was as PB (again, this is general and not just this location). Also, the pastries (which is the main thing I get here) aren't as good IMO.

Honestly, my main complaint with this location versus others is that I just find the service to be slower. Granted, this DOES seem to be a pretty busy location. I still stop in from time to time, but not as much as I used to."}
{"text":"This place is new and I have been several times. I would just say be mindful when going through the drive thru. I have been mischarged 3 times. I always use the kiosk when I go in so I see the total but in the drive thru I don't  know what I am being charged for until I get my receipt. The other morning I was charged 1.30 for a ramekin (pictured) of cream cheese with my bagel. I of course went back the next day and the manger fixed it but it was still inconvenient to have to go back in. I love Panera and will go back but I will ask for a details before I swipe my card. The bagel was good but the 1.30 ramekin wasn't even enough cream cheese. LOL I only ordered the bagel because they were out of souffles for the 2nd day in row around 7:20. I am going to blame all this on the store being new and still working out the kinks."}
{"text":"went here yesterday and the food was great. the broccoli cheddar soup was the best i've had from a restaurant.  plenty of space to enjoy your food. the bad part -  employees!!!  need to explain to them how customer service works. apparently they are not used to a diverse clientele. classes are definitely needed !!!!"}
{"text":"Obviously if you know Panera, you know what to expect and they are all essential the same in terms of menu and general appearance. 

I frequent this location on the weekends in the morning. This particular Panera Bread is clean and located in the plaza at the corner of Library and Grove Roads. Outdoor seating is available as well as a private room inside if needed. 

It can get busy Saturday and Sunday mornings at which time they seem to have less staff so service can get a little slow but it's not terrible. 

If you like Panera, this one will do!"}
{"text":"I have reviewed other Panera locations and start off by saying this one is as good as any. I think this location is perhaps quieter than some. 

If you have never been to a panera before, they serve hot breakfast sandwiches, bagels, pastries. Also, a variety of smoothies, coffee, tea and hot/cold coffee drinks. For lunches, they do a variety of salads and deli sandwiches. Also soups, some pastas and new \"bowls\" which I have not yet tried. 

I recommend the \"you pick 2\"for lunch/dinner which as you could guess, let's you pick 2 things such as salad, sandwich, soup, pasta, etc. 

Some of my faves are the BBQ chicken salad, tomato soup, grilled cheese, bacon turkey bravo sandwich, turkey chili and broccoli cheese soup. 

For regulars, I recommend getting the My Panera card so you get loyalty perks. To use it, you just have to give your phone number every time you order. You get free items or discounts every so many visits. 

I do love Panera!"}

My company ordered a large take out order and arrived at the time it was supposed to be ready. It wasn't ready for another hour, and they messed up the order so we had to wait even longer. Once we got back to the office I found raw chicken in my salad! I was sick, couldn't even eat the salad. We called and complained and all they did was refund the order. Will never go back!"}

My mom had asked for a coffee but the dark roast was out so she politely let a staff member know who was headed in our direction. She looked disgusted that we'd spoken to her. It was ridiculous the look she gave us. We sat down and ate our breakfast, still without coffee and on our way out tried to get some. The same lady we had asked told us \"there's none in there\" with the same sassy attitude. And walked away.  we just grabbed a flavored one and left super annoyed at this lady. Too bad we didn't get her name, ugh."}
{"text":"Nice place to have a quick lunch. We ordered a steak and cheese sandwich , and chicken chipotle sandwich, both the sandwiches were good. The serving is good, its not big nor small. There are soups, salads, blueberry scones , pecan donut (fresh is really tasty). We ordered  passion papaya tea. It was o k a y ."}
{"text":"I really like this place, the staff is friendly to me if I am friendly to them, i often get over portioned (no complaints there) and the managers are always willing to go beyond expectation when faced with a mess up. Plus the food is amazing alway"}
{"text":"First of all, I'd like to start off with the fact that I love Panera Bread. Soups, salads, breads, and pastas are my ultimate comfort food and this location is conveniently less than five minutes away, so it does sadden me quite a bit to be giving them a three-star rating. For that, I will start with the good stuff:

The food is fresh, filling, and of great taste. The ingredients always deliver quality! The atmosphere includes cozy tungsten lighting and several booths amongst the (kind of) crowded tables and chairs; however, I am knocking off points for this location's service. The time of day definitely matters. I've been here enough to know that sometimes there's a bit of a wait for even the simplest of orders. There was even a circumstance in which someone in my party was told they were out of one of his orders and this would have been completely fine if he was told immediately, but he was told after a twenty-minute wait which meant he had to wait even longer. We were forced to eat ahead of him to avoid dining on cold soup. *tear*

Other than that, Panera's a pretty decent spot to have a healthy meal! I would have given them a four-star rating if it weren't for the service... I do love all of their soups and the Iced Green Tea is a must for those who like a refreshingly sweet beverage! The \"You Pick 2\" is also perfect for numerous combinations!"}
{"text":"I was in town for work meeting and was put in charge of arranging breakfast for everyone.  I went to Panera and placed a rather large order.  I was contacted by the manager, \"David\" who told me I could simply call in the order next time and they would deliver it to our office.  That afternoon I called back and spoke to David and placed another large order.  I explained to him I needed the order to arrive no later than 7:30 because our first speaker was starting at 8:00am.  The next day arrives and at 7:30, no food, 7:45 no delivery.  I call at 7:50 and get David on the line.  When I ask him what's going on and where is my order, he tells me it's sitting on the counter waiting to be picked up.  I told him that I wanted it delivered and I made that clear when I placed the order the day before.  He then tried to blame the whole thing on his employees and said they must have got it wrong.  I told him it was him who took the order, and if anyone was to blame it was him.  Needless to say the food arrived after 8:00 and our speaker had already began.  What bothered as much as the mistake about the delivery, was the fact that David the manager was so quick to try and blame his employees for the mistake rather than take responsibility as the manager, when in fact he was responsible because he took my order.  Needless to say, they will not be getting anymore of our business. Poor leadership!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. I was talking to the cashier  in Spanish while I was placing my order. The black female cashie next to the hispanic  one  started to give me an attitude. I asked her if she preferred if I continue talking in English. She went off and 4 other black females came in and started to talk crap to me. I felt I was in one of those gangster movies. The manager and general manager did nothing . I could not believe what I experience. This was the most racist incident I had experience and it was by black people. There you go black lives matter any one else is dog crap. Unbelievable"}

{"text":"Just like any other Panera store.  Clean with great service!  Food is always consistent and coffee is delicious!  Coffee isn't always consistent though so sometimes it does taste like its watered down"}
{"text":"Ordered a smoked turkey sandwich to go. The wait was not too bad, and I was on the road in no time.

When I opened up the wrapping, I have to admit I was underwhelmed with what I saw. It was a very basic looking sandwich for close to $7. The bread, while nice in that it is baked fresh, tasted gummy. They forgot to include onions in the sandwich, which would have helped to break up some of the saltiness of the sandwich from the smoked turkey meat.

Overall I wasn't too impressed, but I'll return to see if other items are better."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and helpful. Clean, friendly, quiet environment. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, so I highly recommend the egg, bacon, white cheddar cheese on Chiba bread. Very yummy. I also love their tortellini pesto lunch dish(they call it something long and I can't spell it or say it, but it is also very good)"}
{"text":"Not bad.

I visited Panera Bread for take out over lunch and opted for the pick 2 menu. I ordered the Asian chicken salad and the tomato mozzarella flat bread with an apple as a side. Other sides include chips or a baguette. 

It was alright; flavour was decent but I was super confused why there was liquid running down my forearm. The flat bread was so saturated with tomato juice, it was almost soggy. I think it must be some type of pre-made bruschetta mix in there because it was just so liquid-y (see picture for reference). Like I said, flavour was great but just totally unexpected. Thankfully it wasn't at the point of being soggy yet. If I had left it for another 10 minutes, lunch would have been a total disaster.

The cost was about $13 for the three items. I think their layout is weird though. You order then you hover around the side bar for your meal to be made. It's the whole kitchen area though so it's take out and dine in food together. My friend and I were kept busy while we watched the servers and kitchen staff interact with each other... but then we heard them openly complaining about upset dine in customers. Not cool!

Thankfully my cashier was friendly."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a last minute birthday treat for my sons 5th birthday. I had been working all day and was so exhausted but hoping to order a last minute pizza cookie for my son. Unfortunately you have to place your orders for that one day prior so I wasn't able to order the pizza cookie. 
I was kind of disappointed and one of the staff members must have noticed my disappointment so she immediately offered to try to create a happy birthday cookie on a smaller cookie rather then the large pizza size cookie. It was an incredibly kind gesture which turned out to be amazing!
Having someone go out of their way to make something so special for my son meant the world to me. We need more kindness like that in this world. 
Thank you Paradise Bakery staff. You will be seeing much more of me!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and no selection.  Stopped to get a bite and all they had was soup and bagels.  Ordered a soup in a bread bowl, they were out of bread bowls.  Okay then, I ordered a bagel with cream cheese, then they were out of cream cheese.  But more than literally having nothing left, they were really rude.  I was pretty excited when I saw there was a Panera bread here because they don't have them where I currently live.  It really sucks when you get there and they act like you being there is an inconvenience."}
{"text":"Where to start . . .

No prices on their paper menu; and limited prices on the wall menu. Impossible to determine the cost of several items, including a fountain beverage or bags of chips.

Employees may need additional training.  Sandwich I selected came with \"sandwich sauce\" and cashier had to leave the register and walk into kitchen to ask if it included mayonnaise.

8 - 10 vacant table in dining room, but all except one had dirty dishes (not paper plates, so a busser has to remove) remaining from previous customers.  Table where I sat had grease stains, crumbs and food particles from previous diner.  No napkin dispensers apparent in dining room, so couldn't wipe down the table myself, until I got 2 napkins delivered with my food.  Very unsanitary.  Your menus have \"Food should be clean.\" - the dining room should be, too.

Food runner who brought my food said \"Sorry about all of the plates, we've been really busy.\"  Really?  Too busy to clear tables?

Beverage bar had non-working lemonade dispenser.  It was filled with lemonade but would not dispense product.  I asked an employee for assistance and all she said was, sorry, it's broken.  A second dispenser labeled green tea was empty.

Best thing I can say is that my food was good (Italian Combo Sandwich).  May or may not be back."}
{"text":"It's not bad but its extremely over priced for that it is. I had a turkey sandwich and a cherry lemonade and it came out to over $12!!! That's way overpriced for a sandwich that isn't even that amazing. Tim Hortons has turkey  sandwiches that are bigger and have softer fresher tasting bread for about $6. This place is a total rip, a place that's know for bread and doesn't even have great bread..."}
{"text":"Note: Was 4 starts until my experience on Sunday, read about it below.

On Sunday May 2nd I was at the Panera Cafe at Heartland Town centre in Mississauga Ontario I was there at about 3PM. and I had a horrid experience. There was sign on the door saying that the store would be closing at 7PM. First thing after walking in I noticed the customer in front of me was have a disagreement with the cashier. Working retail I brushed this off since it happens all the time. Then the store was out of a bunch of menu items including iced green tea. I walk up to the counter and order the pick two. A large Mac and Cheese and the Creamy tomato soup. While waiting for my takeout order there was one angry looking employee making the food for dine in and take out. There were 2 cashiers and only one person making food from my experience the cashiers should not out number the servers but thats none of my business. What is my business is the women making the food was absolutely the most horrid person I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. 
She obviously hated what she was doing. One person in dine let her know she forgot blue-cheese on her blue cheese and steak salad and she angrily replied that \"I know I didn't miss the blue-cheese obviously I didn't put enough for you.I can only put what I'm allowed\" She snapped the the girl. No customer deserves to be spoken to that way.Me and another customer waiting for our takeout orders heard and looked at each other baffled as to how anyone working in the service industry can be so rude to a customer who was not rude at all.
Then I was waiting for 10 minutes for my takeout order. The place wasn't overly busy and the women making the food kept slamming what I think is the panini machine shut. I'm shocked it didn't break. 
She was absolutely a horror to deal with. When paying $18 for a meal I dont expect to be treated as a chore let alone listen to the worker abuse customers.
I regret to say I probably won't be going back to Panera after my experience."}
{"text":"This is a new location, so one has to make allowances for inexperienced staff. It needs a strong manager to direct these new employees. I have stopped in several times in the past two weeks and always had a problem or two. For example, after I ordered yesterday's lunch, i took my seat and watched the board for the name of whose order they were preparing and whose was ready, thinking that was the \"eat in\" system. My name didn't appear, so I went to the pick up area and saw the person who had taken my order chatting with another server. I spied my order (soup) on the counter and tried to retrieve it. She said that she had been waiting to bring my my order because she had forgotten to give my the vibrating pager associated with my order. When I finally sat back down, the soup was almost cold. Other locations have the flow worked out much better. Also, the small size is a drawback. Things will most likely improve as the staff figure out their roles."}
{"text":"This location always seems to exhibit sub-par performance. At 7 pm on 4/6, it had run out of ice. The sign on the ice maker said \"See front counter.\" The menu was missing the bowl I usually order; just tortilla chicken available now, and no turkey chili. The bakery case was out of many items; I guess that is par for the course 3 hours before closing, but it discourages a future evening visit."}
{"text":"I was wary when Paradise Bakery got bought out, but I thought what could go wrong? Everything. Everything went wrong. 

All my favorite reasons for coming to this location were gone. The atmosphere and cafe completely changed, somehow reducing the amount of seating in what was once a large, vast dining area that could accommodate the heavy lunch crowds this location received. 

then the food. they have completely revamped the menu to fit the Panera Bread MO. In other words when I asked for Fire Roasted Tomato Soup I heard \"that was unhealthy so we don't offer it anymore\". When I asked for the tortellini, \"We've been out of that since yesterday\". 
I settled on a blonde, tasteless turkey something-or-other that was advertised as \"New and Fresh!\" Tasteless. 

I won't be coming back. Ever. I will instead have to find a new and fresh salad soup and sandwich dining experience elsewhere."}
{"text":"By far the best Paradise in Phoenix! I go here multiple times a week and they have the friendliest staff and he food is amazing! My kids love it and so does my wife!"}
{"text":"I really wish their was a closer Panera to where I stay in North town but probably best that their isn't as well. Every employee I've encounter here had been very pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"We stopped in Panera for a late evening snack. The staff was very pleasant as we have come to expect and the soup and half sandwich selection suited us well. The cream of chicken with wild rice soup was very good, and my wife also enjoyed her chicken noodle soup. We each had the ham and swiss cheese sandwiches. 

The table staff person was friendly and attentive without being overly so. We just don't think to go to Panera often enough."}
{"text":"This location refuses to accept faxed orders!??!  

I needed to place a catering order for 13 boxed lunches today just as I've done in the past.  I called and was told that 1- this location won't accept any faxed orders and 2- that they couldn't accommodate any boxed lunches today at all.?.  

They told me I was welcomed to order individual lunches instead of actual boxed lunches.  I did attempt ordering individual lunches online as they recommended until I discovered that it won't allow me to assign names to each sandwich.  This means we'd have to sort through a big bag of 13 sandwiches, 13 sides and 13 cookies before our group could even get on with their lunch meeting...  Sorry Panera - not acceptable in 2014."}
{"text":"While eating lunch we noticed a long line of ants along the wall at our booth.  We of course got up and moved all our stuff and alerted an employee.  The issue is that after being notified nothing was done.  Patrons continued to sit at the booth with the ants and we'd have to tell them not to sit there.  This continued to happen so I told another employee about the ants hoping someone would actually come out and remove them but it still was not addressed.  The ants were still there on the wall when we left = FAIL.  If this was acceptable in the front dining area then it makes me wonder what is acceptable in the kitchen where I can't see?  This will be my last visit to this Panera Bread  :-("}
{"text":"Some good some bad.  This goes for the food and the service.  You MUST check your order if it's to go in any of the locations.  I have had more mistakes than correct orders in the last year or so.  

The \"presses\" are MICROWAVES.  They are not training their employees to know this and they are not making it public.  I had an employee actually argue about it with me this morning because I wanted them to toast my bagel and assemble the egg and cheese without nuking it.  I got to my car and they had forgotten the cheese.  I went back and the cook told me that the counter person didn't know if I wanted it!  I think someone should have double checked if this was the case as the sandwich comes with cheese to begin with.

Even Burger King doesn't microwave their breakfast!"}
{"text":"Corporate greed has them drifting from healthy and nutritious food and into the realm of the general bad fast food abyss with the addition of their new microwave panini presses.  This is very sad as I was a pretty big regular and fan of what they had been trying to accomplish so many years ago when they started this chain.  Go to http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/05/18/microwave-hazards.aspx to read about why you shouldn't let them microwave your food.  

They always seem to 86 my favorite menu items.  My favorite bakery item was the chocolate chip cookie with walnuts.  Gone due to some of the population having nut allergies. They actually did me a favor but I used to crave these desperately.  There was a salad that I used to think was the best they made and is gone now too..... can't remember it, it was a couple years ago now.  None of the salads now compare or do much for me.  Maybe they killed it because of the food cost.  

I think the bread and pastry there are good quality items.  When they remember to keep their coffee fresh it's pretty good as well.  There are still things to order here but it's not great anymore."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch today for delivery and a hot tea to drink. When the order arrived I noticed that there was no hot water for the tea but I had some at my office. I made the tea with the variety of tea bags that came with my order. About an hour later Peppard came back to my office and re- delivered the hot water and a special treat. Even though I wasn't upset about having to make my own I was so surprised he drove all the way back! Its nice to see there are good people in this world still. Thank you Peppard for your exceptional service! The food was great too!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the food but the staff never has it together. Seems like they have a super high turnover. Why give me or every one a table number if you don't bring out the food.."}
{"text":"Just ok. I liked the selection & the menu! The kids choices were disappointing. But I did like that the calories were listed on the menu. And I love the self ordering, no waiting in long lines! The women's bathroom was super gross & dirty. Out of soap & hand towels. Kind of disappointed by that."}
{"text":"Why is this place so popular? The sandwiches are nothing special and for what you get are overpriced. The only plus is the free wifi."}
{"text":"Not sure why all the hate. 
Been here 3 times in the last week, after my first time.

Here's the perks.

Aside from friendly, easy service - and everything laid out so that after enough time of looking at the menu, it's easy to understand and comprehend. 

Get the panera bread card. Like a frequent customer card. It gets you a free beverage, 1 a day with purchase, every day for a month long! 
Plus, buy something and get a pastry for only a buck.
All made to order, and after saving a bunch of cash it becomes a pretty good deal!
Frontega chicken is bomb. Free stuff is always bomb.
Can't help but show love!"}
{"text":"Love the cinnamon crunch bagel especially as a breakfast sandwich. The atmosphere is great with free wifi with lots of available seating. Service is speedy."}
{"text":"The service here is bad. Ordered online and found out when we arrived that they were out of something that we ordered. Then they acted like they didn't have our order at all. Took forever. Cashier not nice or helpful at all. Bad experience."}
{"text":"I like Panera. It's overpriced but I already know that walking in the door. However what I don't need is rude and overpriced. I'm a nurse, sometimes my job is rough and I all want to do is go grab a quick sandwich and soup   Not be talked to like I'm a toddler who needs disciplined.  Thanks to an older lady named DIANA, the rudest Panera employee I've ever encountered I won't be patronizing this store anymore"}
{"text":"Oh man, panera bread!!!! Delicious, delicious, delicious!!!! I've been to this location many times over the last 10 years!!! The turkey and avocado sandwich never disappoints!!! I love the classy atmosphere this place offers!!"}
{"text":"This Panera Bread location has a very interesting layout and the staff is very friendly! I love how big it is and the seating is crazy amazing! The food is extremely tasty as well! I highly suggest this place!"}

As you enter, look up at the menu and pan your eyes to the left where it says 'You Pick 2'!

1/2 Sandwich - Mediterranean veggie sandwich & a choice of soup (or salad)- Cream of chicken and wild rice for only about $7.50. There's a calorie count on the right of the item - for the health conscious. 

My friends and I were given a number each and everything was brought to our table in no time. Very laid-back bakery/restaurant, great place to chat the day away. Place smells delicious and the aroma continues to fill you up long after the meal is over. Affordable and good quality food."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 14' * 29/100

Panera has become a regular a Mother-Daughter hangout spot over the past year even if it's a little out of our way. 

There's just something intimate about eating at a cute sandwich place with Mommy. It brings about good conversations and sets a good mood for the rest of the day. Like always, we choose the 'you pick two' option but frequently switch up our pairing. Yesterday, I ordered the Frontega Chicken Panini (chopped basil, chipotle sauce, red onions and chicken fillet on foccacia bread) with cheddar broccoli soup (my favorite) while mommy ordered the Turkey Breast Sandwich with French Onion Soup. On top of it, we shared a couple packets of chips to go with the meal.

Service was very fast despite a large crowd. Our orders arrived on our tables within 3-5 minutes of waiting. They provide their diners with an electronic table locator which helps staff navigate their way through the restaurant, finding customers who change seats. Water cups are free with ample supply of lemon slices and shaded outdoor seating is available for the warm spring months. There's jazz music playing in the background and blinds lowered for when the sun is high up during the afternoon hours. 

I don't remember a Panera experience where I didn't enjoy. Props also to the staff for being so patient with me and my bestie about a month back when we stayed for 3 hours or so making origami boxes for her sister-in-law. We are definitely coming back here more often in the near future."}
{"text":"This location is nice quiet and clean. Employees are extremely courteous. Although parking here can be very difficult due to the numerous businesses in this location there is an underground parking structure but who wants to park there right? 

Coffee is pretty decent here and my 7 year old loves the cookies here."}
{"text":"I've been to many Panera locations. This location has been good in the past, but just had an all-around bad experience here. I didn't catch the name of the cashier, she had blue dreadlocks, but she barely acknowledged our existence beyond the droll recitation of required questions. She was blunt and rude, interrupted us, didn't say anything conversational despite me and my girlfriend being very polite the entire conversation. It was certainly an unusual encounter compared to my past Panera experiences. We got simply a bagel and a smoothie. We were handed the bagel without a word, and the smoothie took forever, despite no one being in line besides us. I had a reward for a free bagel, but we had to ask for the reward to be applied because the cashier wasn't going to--typically they ask to apply the reward. This seemed to make the cashier angrier and she still didn't say anything except interrupt to announce our new total. Hope management reconsiders any new hires that aren't contributing to a typical Panera experience."}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast with my 2 boys. My youngest wanted to have a chicken noodle soup. Lo and behold, this place does not start making soup in the morning! So we just ordered a ham, cheese and egg for him. When the order came, the top was falling apart as if it was an open-faced but it's just sloppiness of the job. It also came in with additional spinach. Ok, maybe it's a good addition :)

Staff are not that friendly. Maybe they just woke up as well so I'll give them a pass. Seating and ordering is also a little confusing. Do I sit first or do I order first? Up to you!

For the most part, it's ok. Just don't expect great experience."}
{"text":"I love this location of Panera bread. Friendly staff who are helpful within a nice atmosphere. The food was delicious and I appreciate that they bring the food to your table. The only negative comment is that the price is a bit expensive."}
{"text":"This Panera is a disappointment. Imagine ordering a greek chicken salad and finding bacon in it. Yikes! What's worse is when you bring it to their attention, you are treated like a second class citzen. \"Well, you had a special greek salad.\" relented the mouthy food assembler. There was nothing special about my greek salad. Bacon was defintely not an ingredient. The restaurant is usually dirty and the staff rushed. I would pick somewhere else for your lunch."}
{"text":"I've really yet to have a bad experience at Panera Bread. It's a nice place to grab a soup and sandwich for lunch, or a cup of coffee (from a selection of a few varieties) and a baked treat during down hours.

Couple notes I'd like to make, while the majority of staff is your run-of-the-mill students working part-time, the boss seems to be there the majority of the time and is helpful and friendly to more than make up for the nonchalant attitude of the rest of the staff. Second, for a place that puts out the amount of baked goods that Panera does, it would be nice if the place smelled like it...just saying.

As mentioned by other reviewers, if you order hot food, you're handed a buzzer at the order counter, coffee and cold drinks are self-serve and come with free refills. I'm fairly certain that the phenomenal iced tea is made on site; definitely worth a try.

Free wi-fi on site means that there are a lot of your I'll-buy-a-single-coffee-but-stick-around-as-long-as-my-device's-battery-lasts kind of people around, especially with the refill policy, but the seating area is definitely large and divided enough that it's not problematic. While the seating area could be comfier and the music selection could be better, it's a you-get-what-you-pay-for kind of place."}
{"text":"Went here had the broccoli and cheddar soup and a turkey sandwich they were both nasty and the lady behind the counter got into an argument with the man making the food and they yelled back and forth itvwas so uncomfortable we will not be returning"}
{"text":"I had read about the opening of this branch earlier this summer and was looking for an opportunity to visit. Felt like a good roast beef sandwich today, and this place delivered. The staff accommodated my request for foccacia bread instead of the default panini on the menu. The foccacia came drench in olive oil, just the way I like it, the beef was juicy and tender, and the pickled red onion was a nice surprise, and took the sandwich to quite another level. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Well done, Panera!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and the staff were chatting and then rushed us and we were the only ones in line. The food was not that great and our cookies were hard and tossed in a bag.  The experience here was not great and I will not come here again."}
{"text":"Do not order delivery. 
I was so excited about this feature! Food was delivered a little late, when accepting the food from the driver we were told it was our fault because the address was wrong. They repeated the address they had and it was indeed correct ... I could've looked passed this and tried to. Got upstairs to my office and the bag was leaking, mind you, I ordered two salads. 
1 of the salads was leaking, I think from by pickled onions in it (I ordered the green goddess cobb), my first thought was they put the dressing directly on the salad but then saw the onion and also realized no dressing was sent at all... so now I'm munching on a dressing-less salad. 
The second salad was correct, however, the dressing sent in that one had 2 containers of dressing and they were less than half full each... 
from now on, I'll definitely just pick up the food myself!"}
{"text":"PROS: 
Wireless internet! A huge plus is the parking lot, you can park without paying. The location is good, and you can easily get into the lot. A pretty large space with good food at affordable prices. The people working there are young, nice, and helpful. The tables look clean. 

CONS: There are only a few outlets in the entire restaurant. One which was located in the far back near the elevators to the adjoining hotel and the bathrooms. This made it very noisy and distracting with people constantly walking by. It was also an awkward place, behind a wall, and people obviously wondered why I seem to be \"hiding\". This is a huge negative since you go to Panera's not just for the food, but for a convenient place to get some work done."}
{"text":"Place has a bright and clean new look. I have been here a few times since it changed from Paradise. Good food and service every time. Their black bean soup was amazing but has since been replaced by the summer corn chowder which is equally as tasty."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the Panera brand, but this particular location has issues ranging from untrained staff to managers who wouldn't know customer service if it sat on their face. Make sure if you get a to go order you check the bag BEFORE you leave. They always forget something."}
{"text":"Today was the last time this location will receive business from me. My delivery order was 45 minutes late. When I called to inquire about it thirty minutes after it was supposed to be here, I was on hold for ten minutes before I spoke with the manager. My previous order was an hour early. I have to take my lunch at a certain time and I have no way to reheat my food. The two orders prior to these were missing items. Not worth the delivery fees or the trouble. Find somewhere else."}
{"text":"This location was alright. It was about what you would expect. The food was standard Panera although they were out of a few ingredients for a few items that we had ordered, like cilantro for my salad for example. I ordered the pick two with the Southwest Chile Lime Ranch Chicken Salad and the BBQ Chicken Flatbread. The service was a little slow and the location was pretty clean. Overall a standard 3 star from me!"}
{"text":"Guys, it's a Panera.  

Bread isn't baked on-site, so there's no \"bakery\" smell.  Pastries/breads are going to be mediocre.

MENU
I wished there was a Combo Price for the Pick 2.  Instead, based on how the menu is set-up, you hafta do math!  There's a Pick 2 price for each category (soup, sandwich, salad) and you hafta add the 2 items together.  Too much for me, so I think it would be easier if they just provided a blanket price for a combo of different items.

FOOD
I had a 1/2 Cobb Salad - $8, other than having half a hardboiled egg and barely any bacon pieces, it tasted good.  The crust of accompanying baguette was hard AF, I had to tear it with my hands like a cavewoman.  Knife was not cutting it!

I haven't been to Panera in YEARS, so I cannot say whether or not portion sizes have been dwindling, but that's what my friend said...who goes regularly.  Full portion of salad looked HUGE to me though!

SERVICE
There were people coming around to clean up the dirty plates.

Cashier was fine.

ATMOSPHERE
During my morning - mid-afternoon visit, on a weekday, it was fairly loud.  They don't play any background music, so all you can hear is people yammering.  Best to bring your headphones if loud, background noise isn't your thang."}
{"text":"I have worked near this location for 3 years And have visited it for breakfast and lunch. This location is entirely too slow.  It takes way too long to get your food.  Something is usually missing or wrong. The staff moves with no sense of urgency whether you are going through the drive through or walking in. You would think with as long as it takes them, everything would be great. It's disappointing because I love Panera Bread but this location is not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I was craving for Paradise Cafe in SLC and found this gem. 

Not the same, because I LOOOOVE PARADISE and their free cookie but very similar concept.

Order your sandwich, soup, or salad, or 1/2 orders of 2 and receive free chips or an apple! Their ice tea is impeccable!! Idk what type of brew but i was well hydrated. 

The service was quick and great! Given a \"food is ready\" beeper, you can sit anywhere in the cafe. It didn't even beep and a staff member brought out our lunch!

They also have gluten free pastries for the health conscious. 

Check this out for a quick lunch I'm Beautiful Boca Park!"}
{"text":"I just ordered through Panera's mobile app and it was so easy.  When I arrived to pick up my order there was a line but I was able to go over to the rapid pick-up area and get my order, which was already done.  I ordered the Half Chinese Citrus Cashew Salad with Chicken and bought my boys each a flip flop cookie.  The salad comes in a small box that was the perfect size for me.  The price for everything was around $11 and that included a drink as well.  I was very impressed with my salad and I'm sure my boys will enjoy their cookies."}
{"text":"This is the worst Panera in the chain. I have said I'm not coming back but have made the mistake and did. The service is terrible, the restaurant is not clean, and the staff is horribly inefficient. If you're craving Panera, there is one in Southland and one in Squirrel Hill. Go the extra distance. You'll be happier."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE Panera loyalist so this review is hard to write. This location (as well as the location in CMC/Levine hospital down the street) apparently are needing some training as well as system updates, maybe? I placed an order online for rapid pick-up. It was set to be ready in 10 minutes. 17 minutes later I arrived and they had no trace of my order. I showed them the confirmation (still up on my phone screen) and was told they'd make it right then and there. Fine. I go to the front, order breakfast for my mom as well, come back 5 minutes later and I'm told \"We're out of that soufflé. It'll be about 20 minutes for the next batch.\" I have to be to work in 20 minutes. Nothing rapid about this here. Then I was told they have a four cheese soufflé so I agree to take that instead, only to have the woman turn around and tell me they don't have that either because they're selling it to someone else. Great. I was offered a breakfast sandwich. If I had wanted a breakfast sandwich, I would have ordered one. The manager agreed to cancel my order and issue a refund. This is the SECOND time I've had an issue with this location. I won't return but I suggest you fix it soon, Panera"}
{"text":"WHERE'S THE BEEF?

   It amazes me how restaurants could mess up such a simple sandwich like a BLT. A BLT is not exactly a culinary work of art. It is beacon, lettuce, and tomatoes with mayonnaise on bread. Yet, some restaurants mess it up. When I set eyes on my Panera Bread BLT, or more like LT; I was asking the exact question that the old lady asked in the 80s Wendy's commercial \"Where's the beef?\" In this case the beef was beacon. What I saw was a few pieces of ordinary beacon with lettuce and tomato on bread.  The bread was comparable to Wonder bread which is ironic considering that this is Panera Bread. I was unimpressed that there was not a choice of bread and that it was untoasted. The potato chips that I picked as the side was actually better than the sandwich.  

  This is my second time at this Panera Bread. A few weeks ago, I dined here with Shirley. B. The roasted turkey & avocados BLT that I ordered then was a tasty sandwich. And I know that Shirley liked her soup. But that doesn't make up for the atrocity of a sandwich that I had tonight and for the record, a good amount of it was leftover bread.

  The restaurant itself, which is in the Paseo Verde Parkway side of The District, is a clean and attractive dining environment. The noise level is average with some rock playing in the background. And there is sufficient seating and lighting.

 Panera Bread is on the dining level between fast-food and casual dining. You step in line then order off the menu board. After paying, you bring a number to a table. They bring you the food, but you serve your beverage. When your done they bus the table.

  A BLT gives me an impression of a restaurant. And when a BLT is so short of the beacon that it becomes a LT it is leaves me with a poor impression. 

  I never say never. I could return to Panera Bread. Maybe their speciality is bagel sandwiches. Who knows! If I cross that bridge and return to Panera Bread, and leave satisfied with a different sandwich, I can always update my review with a reference to this one. After tonight's sandwich, color me unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Fairly good place!
They've shaped up in the last couple of months."}
{"text":"I visited Panera today after a long absence. I frankly prefer Paradise Bakery. I walked up to the counter expecting to order,but was told to use the computer screen to order my lunch. I went through  the screen as prompted and then put in my number for the table top buzzer. 

My salad arrived a short time later. It was OK; nothing special. What bothered me most was the lack of human element. I do NOT like using the computer to order and will not return."}
{"text":"The Panera-est Panera Bread in Huntersville! whatever that means to you you'll find it here only more so. The selection is usually good: ample bready things and things that go with bready are available throughout the day but like most stores the souffles are randomly there or not.
I generally like Panera but this whole shopping center sets up a little funny. The front of the building faces incoming traffic on Northcross Center Court and there's not really an entrance there. If you parked on the street out front you'll be doing considerable walking, probably wind up getting all your steps for the day as you circumnavigate the store looking for the entrance, cashier, exit, and your car.
So park out back, come in the side door, head further back into the store, place your order and then go towards the light looking for your final resting place.
Dining rooms have always been clean and well kept on my visits and the noise level isn't much of a concern. Good a place as any to try to get some work done unless your with people in which case you should put your phone away and talk with your mouth."}
{"text":"Another 1 star day here at Panera  (south tryon). It's a little more than 2 hrs before closing and they are out if croissants ..and out of bread (chips or apple, we're my only side choices..."}
{"text":"The best place to hang out with friend over breakfast and business meeting over lunch. It's clean and crowded, but the environment is just cozy enough to sit for a long time. Free refill coffee makes it perfect. 

The only downside is that their wi-fi is really slow and unstable."}
{"text":"Bathroom never has soap or paper towels. And I would know because it is near my work and I'm there probably once a week. The tables are rarely wiped down too. I come for the wifi and food, but may be finding another spot soon."}
{"text":"What is up with Panera constantly adding and removing the turkey cranberry flatbread from the menu? This is hands-down the best menu item. At first it appeared seasonal then it seemed like they were just holding onto it for as long as they possibly could. Eventually it falls off the menu again.

Well that aside Panera is one of my favorite chain restaurants. I remember being unimpressed by them back in my college days but now I've developed a taste for well...everything. They've got plenty of other good stuff to offer including sandwiches, soups, salads and bakery items out the wazoo. I've recently taken a liking for the green passion smoothie. I also appreciate their many drink offerings outside of the range of \"fountain sodas\". If you're looking for something to grab before a small party or office luncheon I highly recommend the coffee crumble cake. The name is misleading; perhaps the only thing it has to do with coffee is to be eaten alongside a cup of it. The many cookie, muffin, scone and other cake options are endless. Don't forget you can even buy your whole loaves of bread here. I personally prefer more local places if I'm going out of my way to get a specialty loaf.

Prices aren't terrible here. You have to remember quality over quantity. It doesn't seem like they use a lot of organics though. That would justify the somewhat high pricing. Their selection of ingredients is broader for sure. In any case, I haven't met someone who doesn't like a trip to Panera. And this one is close to home so it'll be my new regular go-to location."}
{"text":"Panera Bread is a chain, yes. But a good kind of chain. High quality stuff that you're gonna find at the same level of goodness no matter which Panera you visit. This one though, just so happens to be pretty close to my house. It is the closest Panera in fact. Walking distance. I can make a weekend day of a walk to the nearby shopping rounded off with a lunch stop here. Or, my preferred timing, a morning trip before work to grab a few flatbread sandwiches for the road. Maybe it's a seasonal thing, but currently the turkey-cranberry flatbread is not on the menu. I miss it dearly. Other favorites include just about any of their soups, the pick 2 menu option, the fact that an apple is a side item choice and the wide selection of different drinks that include tea in their name.

The environment at this spot could use a little work. Perhaps they need a bigger building? The inside feels cramped. Since so many people love Panera, the tables are often packed. Church groups, study groups, like minded locals, you name it! Free WiFi is basically a big deal these days and Panera delivers. WiFi I mean. But food too."}
{"text":"This place is really a hit or miss. A lot of times, they're out of a certain ingredient so almost every time I've been here, I've been told to order something else instead. With that said, there are some items on the menu good enough to keep me coming back all the time. 

Recommend:
- Mac and cheese: the flavour is always on point; it hasn't disappointed me yet. 
- Smoothies: their fruit smoothies are so refreshing and it doesn't taste watered down at all. 
- Poppyseed & chicken salad: perfect blend of vegetables and meat. Tastes really fresh. 

Do NOT recommend:
- Tomato soup: it tastes bland and pain. They'll give you a baguette with the soup but the bread is so hard that even when you dip the baguette in the soup, the bread is still really difficult to chew. 
- Flatbread: I've tried almost all their flatbreads and I didn't enjoy any of them. It tastes like something you would buy at Tim Hortons. 

I definitely suggest going for their Pick 2, where you get to try a smaller serving of 2 different things. I also recommend getting a myPanera card if you plan on going more than once because it'll give you rewards once in a while which are always a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Yes, Panera is a chain.  Not a bad thing in this case.  It offers consistency which is the utmost reason to go to a chain for me.

PROS:
1)  Space is comfortable, roomy enough.  I never have problems finding a table and never feel rushed to finish so someone else can have my table.
2)  Free wifi.  Not only free wifi, but it is a great place to get work done without feeling you can only be there on your laptop for the amount of time it takes you to eat.
3)  Healthy food choices.  And now, according to their website,  \"It's clean food. Food without artificial preservatives, sweeteners, flavors or colors from artificial sources.\"  I like that!
4)  Not only healthy food choices, but colorful, eye-catching, and flavorful!
5)  And not just healthy food  -- I can cheat and get something decadent from the bakery side, too.  99 cents on top of my other food choices gets me something from the bakery.  Of course I'm going to partake!
6)  Free refills on sodas 
7)  Clean environment
8)  Reasonably clean restroom
9)  They give back to the community -- check it out on their website.
10)  Easy parking
11)  Panera card to get points.  Damn!  I keep saying I'm going to sign up and never do.... I just did so now I'll get rewards.  Yay!
12)  After you order, they now come to you to deliver your food instead of how you used to have to wait for it and then go to the counter and get it.  I like that!
13)  You can order online in advance (haven't tried that feature yet)
14)  I think the price is reasonable enough.  My pick 2 with 1/2 a Chinese Chicken Cashew salad and tomato soup with bread, pastry, and a soda was about 13.00.

CONS:
1)  Can't think of any."}
{"text":"Cherry Vanilla bagels are back!!! :) So good. We go there for bagels, always good, never fails. The bummer is the cream cheese isnt the best but whatever, it's a bakery not a dairy :)

The service is always friendly, could use a more intelligent staff, but I think I may be asking for too much in that dept. WIll always come for bakery items....the rest of the menu has no special desire in my soul."}

{"text":"Came in for dinner Sylver was at the register but working on something and let us know it would be a second. We took awhile to decide and order. Not sure if the chicken on the salad is supposed to come hot I think it may have at another location which is why I liked it and got it again."}
{"text":"Average Panera Bread restaurant-bakery-coffee house. Fewer \"cozy\" seating areas to relax at, mostly (all?) booths and tables. No cinnamon or nutmeg available to sprinkle on your coffee... 

We ordered a pick-2 soup+salad combo and a full sized salad. Onion soup was fine, no cheese or croutons, had to ask. Full sized salad good, half salad mostly tough kale. 

Coffee was fine once they managed to find some cinnamon to boost the flavor (my standard fixin at any Panera). 

Staff okay, somewhat disinterested, but competently attended to the order."}
{"text":"My favorite here is the broccoli cheddar cheese  soup. 
Bakery goods very good
Fresh bread!!! Happy place"}
{"text":"This visit was disappointing. I wanted something sweet so I ordered a chocolate chip cookie. I get all the way to work to find that it was almost as  hard as a rock. And it was still warm!! Lesson learned...check it before I leave!"}
{"text":"Wow. Soba noodle bowl and small side if Mac and cheese $14.79.  Complete rip off. I Would not reccomend going here. Their sandwiches are very small and expensive as well"}
{"text":"Horrible experience at lunch today! Tried to use the \"fast lane\" kiosk which was anything but.  After keying in an order for 3 people we discovered we couldn't use our $25 gift card (asked a manager who arrogantly just said \"no.\" Not \"no, I'm sorry\" just flat out \"no!\". A sign or notice of some kind at the kiosk would be appropriate right?  We also had a $5 member reward applied to our order.  So we ordered at the register after all, which then negated the $5 off coupon because it had to be online or at said kiosk.  No big deal I suppose but the manager referenced above could have honored it.  We finally get to our table in hopes that the poor service would be over, but those hopes were soon dashed when the food came out. One of the sandwiches had a nice long hair dangling from it, one of them was supposed to be toasted and the 3rd was surprisingly correct.  After sending back the 2 wrong meals, one of them was returned minus the soup.  We finally eat and as we were about to leave the same manager walks by our table.  Instead of stopping by the table and apologizing for the inconvenience he looked at me with the same arrogance as before and kept walking.  

I asked another employee what the manager's name was and he said it was Aaron Taal.  Frankly this guy should be working in the kitchen as far away from customers as possible.  I'll never go back."}
{"text":"1st Visit:
Even seeing the lower rating for this location, I decided to stop in for after work take out food. They weren't busy at all, I suppose it is because they are still new and possibly unknown. But, it's nice to see new restaurants in this area - they are desperately needed!

Took a second to browse the menu and placed my Pick 2 order. I'm also a Reward Member and had a free pastry reward so I picked the Chocolate Chipper cookie - by far one of the best cookies I have eaten. 

Half Green Goddess Cobb Salad w/Grilled Chicken: very fresh and delicious.
Half (I already forgot the sandwich): Very fresh and delicious.

After To-GO order you head towards the back of the restaurant to wait by the server/to-go window and there is a monitor with the list of patrons in line. Even with three in front of me, it went pretty fast.

On the way out I stopped to purchase a cinnamon roll for the next morning and the nice young lady just handed me one and said have a great night! Wow.

I'll definitely be back, especially to check out Panera breakfast. Who knew they had breakfast?

2nd Visit: 
So, I finally stopped in for breakfast. Wanting something other than a pastry, I decided on a healthy turkey sausage, egg white, spinach and cheese sandwich. As well as a large iced coffee. Service was fine, employees were friendly.. but boy am I disappointed in this sandwich. There was no disclaimer that it was a turkey sausage patty - but instead, turkey sausage crumbles inside the egg white. What!? Don't quite get that - would've liked a warning so I could definitely not order it...

In the end, I didn't end up eating most of it. What a waste of five dollars! It wasn't until I got to work, opened the sandwich and asked wheres the turkey sausage patty? I searched the PB website only to reveal the meat on this sammie is blended into the egg whites. Nooooo! It must be a pattyyyy!! Come on Panera! :sadface:

The iced coffee was ok. It was self serve.

The end."}
{"text":"Great place for a meeting. Excellent food. Exciting atmosphere. Highly recommend. I meet every month with my event services cohorts. We have a good time every time. Food is fresh and healthy. AC always works. Haha. Gets hot in Scottsdale. Why I writing this mostly for is the integrity of Panera bakery. They could've turned over our time to a new group who would have come in there for more days per month but they didn't. They did the right thing. That is so awesome!   Kudos."}
{"text":"Talk about excellent customer service skills! If you ever eat here, Bria came from
Behind the register to check on me and make sure I was satisfied and that if I wasn't, I'd be happy before I walked out that door. I SO appreciate her service skills. She deserves a raise. I'll come back specifically for her. Thanks Bria!"}
{"text":"Love it! Foods always hot and fresh and staff are always very nice. I've never had to wait too long when picking up an order or using the drive thru even when they're busy."}
{"text":"Crappy WiFi. Good turkey sandwich. Bravo."}
{"text":"I'll admit to wanting to like Panera Bread, but having a hard time doing so.  It's something like Starbucks in that regard.  I think it's because I just don't go there often.

The service is almost always top-notch, and you also have to like that they have free wireless connectivity (when it works).  But really - who cares if you have free access for your laptop when you're eating, and while there are people who sit there for hours at a time to use up the free services, who wants to do that?  I'd rather sit on my computer at home than do it at Panera.

My biggest complaint is that I can't find something that really hits the spot.  Yes, the drinks are decent, as are the bread offerings, but they don't really fill me up.  If I want a sandwich, I'll go the fridge rather than go to Panera.  It's not that they are bad, it's just not my thing."}
{"text":"Panera is one of those places that rarely comes on my radar - despite that fact that I've been there half a dozen times (or more) over the years, and generally find it a reasonable experience when I do. They are in a good location - though it can be a bit of a challenge to get to if you're headed the wrong way - and the staff is typically friendly as well, if a touch on the slow side.

When it comes to menu options, they sound good on the board, and like most places, they look interesting as well when you see the pictures, but they don't quite look as good when they actually come out, but they are decent. I just don't know that an $8 bagel sandwich with chips is really worth it in the end. At least the decor is nice."}
{"text":"Waited for Fall seasonal menu items before returning after several months. The place looked and smelled unkept.  The management were hanging around eating off the display cases and had absolutely no interaction with customers.  Food did not live up to the high standard of quality that has been Panera. I noted that many tables were occupied at 10.30 a.m., barely anyone was eating. Had to clean off our table before sitting. This store needs to up their management and gear up or they will be losing more customers,  like me."}
{"text":"Disappointed!  Fr Onion Soup salty, not hot - used shredded cheese & it didn't melt!   Tomato Soup sent back (cold) & meal done by the time it arrived. Tasted like tomato sauce vs Soup.  No options offered for type of bread for sandwich, got cold white bread. No option for sides - got baguette - best part of the meal.  The 1/2 Sandwiches were OK but not anything special. Not worth the $25 for 2 people.  No evidence of management. We won't return."}
{"text":"Not sure why keep going to back to this Panera Bread?  I sure do miss Paradise Bakery. Forgot half my order and when I called they said they would put it in the computer that I would get it when the next time I went into their location. Rapid pick up more like keep forgetting to put my cookies in the bag so quickly for me. They should probably just close this location and put a different restaurant in their spot. I mean how hard would it be to check the bag I mean you're doing cookies and pastries all day long you think you would at least know how to get it right. #lost cookies"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. AWEFUL... ordered a pasta dish and watched it get cut out of a plastic envelope through the drive through window. Child meal didn't come with a drink?!?! My salad was thrown into the box. The dressing size was about a tablespoon for a large salad. My Greek salad with chicken also had the ends of the lettuce head.. GROSS. My husband had to GO BACK because his 'small' was more like a child size, or a side to a meal. PATHETIC. The hibiscus tea tasted like it came from a package. The rolls were not even in a small paper package, just put in the bag unwrapped. Disappointed, will NEVER go back there!! What happened to Paradise bakery?!?! BRING THOSE BACK!!! AWEFUL FOOD HERE!"}
{"text":"After working at Paradise Bakery for 6 years, I swore I would never walk in there again. Well, I still find myself addicted and visit the Ray/101 location about 1x/month. Too expensive for my taste (even when I worked there, I knew I wouldn't be in every day like some people because of the cost) Almost $10 for a half sandwhich/salad is a little absurd, but it is really tasty. I like trying out new or limited menu items, like the salmon Caesar salad (freaked me out a little that the salmon pieces were all shrink wrapped and just plopped on top right out of the plastic) but it was still good and I didn't get sick... But my all time feel-good sandwich is the Chicken Walnut and either the Fire Roasted Tomato soup, or the Southwest Caesar salad. Oh, and the chocolate chip cookie that comes with the sandwich. It can be swapped out with a different kind, but I thoroughly enjoy the classic chocolate chip. When winter rolls around, I can't wait to get a Ginger Molasses Cookie and a Chai Eggnog Latte....yum!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Asian sesame chicken salad, along with a few other items, for rapid pick up. Once I arrived at work, I started to eat the salad and noticed that everything was in the salad EXCEPT for the chicken. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"I ran in to get a cinnamon crunch bagel. This bagel is slightly chewy with a nice amount of crunchy cinnamon topping. The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"I've been at this panera location several times, since it's the closest one to my place. It's not terrible but it's also not great. 

The food is okay. My favorite is their broccoli cheddar soup & their cinnamon crunch (?) bagel. I don't like how they don't serve their soup first thing in the morning. You have to wait til 9 or 10. I've gotten a couple of bagels that were burnt (not extremely but burnt enough). Sometimes their bread is also tough. However, most times their food is good. 

Service is okay. A lot of the workers here aren't very... Welcoming. Some don't know how to smile. I mean, you don't have to like what you do but part of working in the food industry is being a people person. 

Overall, this place is okay. Hit or miss."}
{"text":"I like Panera Bread and have for years. Their Pick 2 menu option has become my favorite as I can basically split my order to have a hot sandwich and a cold Italian Combo or toss in soup if I want it. Service is typically a cut above many of the places I go, typically friendly and with a lot of smiles. Pricing, yeah its not cheap, and portion sizes are not huge. But I prefer quality over quantity and I find that here. 

I avoid the Cinnamon rolls and brownies because they are so good. 4 Strong Stars.

Oh and they have Iced Chai Tea that is the closest I've found to what is served at Burning Man'"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food, but they cannot simply get our order right...ever. I am not exaggerating and its not just sometimes, it is every time. Whether it be as simple as forgetting extra dressing on the side, or an extra baguette we paid for, all the way up to forgetting the roast beef in my Asiago roast beef sandwich! We have even had pieces of a plastic bag in the soup we ordered. I've eaten at other Paneras across the country and I do not recall as many issues as this particular location has, which leads me to believe poor management is responsible. We have brought it to several different manager's attention, and the issues are still ongoing. So beware if ordering takeout, be prepared to double check your order, even unwrapping your sandwich to make sure they didn't forget the meat. If dining in, chances are you will be asking the server to bring you an item they forgot to include, but at least they can correct that while you are there."}
{"text":"I usually love Paradise Bakery but this location is the worst.  I agree with Ken B.  this is the worst location ever.  My complaint is specifically with they way the smaller counter is handled, the one that you would most likely visit in the morning for a muffin and coffee.  The staff doesn't listen to you when you order they are too busy paying attention to the \"regulars\" and just let them interrupt you while your ordering.  Today I ordered a coffee and a muffin, right in the middle a regular walked in and started to ask about the cookie boxes.  The person helping me actually stopped helping me and was going to start answering his questions, meanwhile, I was standing there waiting for my coffee cup and had to remind her!!!!  This location just plain sucks."}
{"text":"I came here two days in a row. First time was great. I got the steak panini. It had onions and horseradish sauce on it. It was delicious. I also got the corn chowder. It was good and spicy and had a kick to it. Second time I got the chicken panini, it didn't have panini bread on it but that's ok. The bread was slightly burnt. I also got the chicken and wild rice soup. 

My only issue with this location and it could be all locations was that we called for a to go order and they told us we had to do it online. Ugh, annoying. We went online to do it and had some questions so we had to call the restaurant back and ask our questions. Time consuming. My other issue is when we ordered the second time, right when we were about to pay, it informed us that an item wasn't available. I get that the online concept might be quicker but sometimes when you are on the go it's hard to do. I hope they would reconsider taking orders by phone."}
{"text":"Clam chowder and chicken and wild rice soup is my favorite!! Their chicken Caesar sandwich is great too. Their Caesar dressing is probably one of the best I've had. Service has always been good here. I've never had them mess up my to go order. They deliver too!"}
{"text":"I love getting to go orders from here. When I arrive home, my food is still hot. Chicken Caesar sandwich is so awesome. Their Caesar dressing is probably one of the best I've ever had. Soups are good too! My favorite is the clam chowder and chicken wild rice. Cookies are huge and enough for two people!"}
{"text":"Nice location. It is well maintained and seems to be staffed with friendly and efficient folks. Our chicken Caesar salad was very good and it's nice to be able to get your own refills. We always use the kiosk to order our meals because we find it to be efficient and it's nice to see all your customization options without feeling like you are bothering someone. We see there's also an option to order from your table at the website.  Haven't used that but interesting concept."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the low ratings that are here. My experience has been nothing but positive since this location opened. Visited again today for probably the fifth or sixth time and it was no different. I appreciate the kiosks that are available and allow you to skip the line and place your order yourself, including paying for it and personalizing your selections. We did so today with no issues and then found a nice quiet table. A few minutes later our order arrived, filled perfectly and with plenty of napkins (a bonus). The server asked if there was anything else we needed and then left us to enjoy our meal, which we did. No complaints or concerns with any aspect of our visit."}
{"text":"I've been to Panera so many times, all my experiences have just blended together to create one big memory blob. I will base my review of this Panera from that memory blob.

I walk through a set of double doors. I stroll past several couples dining of their sandwiches and salads, and a handful of solo coffee drinkers wearing their headphones and glaring at their laptop screens. I stop close enough from the cashiers to let them know that I am, indeed, a customer, but not too close to give them the impression that I am ready to order. I argue with myself: \"Do I want the You-Pick-Two? That sounds good, but do I want a sandwich, salad, or soup? Oh gosh, they changed the menu! That new seasonal salad looks good...so does that soup...and the sandwich. Wait, do I get a regular sandwich or a panini? Argh, I still need to decide on the second item! And a drink! Ahh!\"

After another minute, I finally place my order. I take my receipt and the buzzer, get a glass of water, and find a seat (booth or table? Decisions decisions...). Once the buzzer goes off, I get my tray and sit back down. The presentation is quite nice, The soup is piping...warm? Okay, good enough. The salad looks great! I'm glad I got my dressing on the side; they sometimes drench my salad in dressing.

Fast forward to after I finish my meal. The salad lettuce was crunchy and fresh; the toppings were nice and tasty; the apple chips were okay, but got a little soggy when I added the dressing. I can't complain about the soup, except maybe it was a little watery (I'm talking about the garden vegetable soup for those wondering). Okay, time to clean up. Okay, what goes where again? Right, utensils in the small rectangular bin (*drop drop*); bowls in the larger bin...but I need to clean up the leftovers (blah! *spill drop bang bang bang*); napkins in the trash; tray on top. Okay, my hands are all gross now. Time to wash them....all washed! Time to go home!

Well, I hope you enjoyed my somewhat disorderly thought processes in this review! Essentially, my experience at almost every Panera is the same. Decent food, nice staff, really good coffee, and good desserts. Breakfast isn't anything special; just overpriced oatmeal and breakfast sandwiches. I would rather make them at home instead of getting them here."}
{"text":"5-18-16 There were flies crawling all over the baked goods!  I called the manager, Kathy.  She said, the waitress was just boxing them up.  I said, you mean boxing them up to sell to customers who have no idea flies have been crawling all over the goods??!!  Kathy said, what do you want me to do?  Lock the doors?  I said I want you to care how you treat people.  She laughed.  Enough said?  A prior reviewer mentioned flies in the salad.  That did it for me.  Noooooo thank you.  I am filing out a health code violation with Maricopa County but not sure they will care.  I've been going into this location on occasion for about six years.  I always have to brace myself for how rude the employees are and how incredibly slow the service is.  Yet, I don't seem to have this problem in their other locations."}
{"text":"This Panera Bread is great..the staff is on top of things and they always deliver consistent service as well as delicious food. 

It is definitely my favorite morning treat to stop by here and get the breakfast power sandwich with a bowl of fresh fruit. Best way to start the day. 

And the Panera card is really worth it..as you use it you get points and every few visits, they are offering me something free..this morning I got a free pastry..hey, I'll take that!

Thanks Panera!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Panera bread. Janelle & Vanessa did an amazing job! They had great customer service with a positive attitude."}
{"text":"Great delivery service! Food comes on time and well put together. Order is correct and if they don't have something They have called me for a substitute option. Good is fresh and tasty. I order the Pick 2 option, which is half order of a salad, soup, or sandwich. The baked goods are pretty tasty too. Although I would recommend reading the calories posted on their website because some of the items can rack up a lot of calories before you even know it. Highly recommend if catering or ordering for large groups. The steak and cheese sandwich is my favorite. It has some horseradish sauce that isn't too strong and the meat is very tender. Yum."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times. It's convenient, and closer to my house than the other locations. I have only had pleasant experiences; with the exception of the a-hole that didn't say thank you after I held the door open for him twice, everything was great lol."}
{"text":"So I have been coming here to always get the creamy tomato soup. Sorry can't say I've tried the other soups since I'm addicted to this tomato soup. You can order the cup which is good for an individual serving or a bowl which will most likely have you sleeping after you eat it all. It comes with a side order of apples, kettle chips or a small baguette. I prefer the bread which you can ask to be toasted and add butter. Love dipping it in the soup. You also get small croutons as well. A good lunch meal for about $6.00. Can't go wrong with this. The line ups at lunch move quickly and he wait for food time isn't long. My go to soup place"}
{"text":"OK, another place that has bowled me over with stellar, beyond-the-call-of-duty customer service.

I went in for a quick to-go sandwich. The food at Panera is always tasty.

I was second in line, but I knew what I wanted. Unfortunately the woman in front of me couldn't seem to remember her own name. 

A second cashier named Natasha came up and beckoned for me to come to her register. She apologized for the wait (which wasn't her fault, and in all honestly, wasn't all that long.) I told her it was no big deal and placed my order. She gave me a free drink for my wait! I was taken aback, because it truly wasn't necessary, but a really nice, simple gesture.

Then, after I paid, she asked if I liked brownies. Puzzled, I said, \"Sure?\" She tossed me one, again apologizing for the wait.

That, folks, is how you win a customer for life. She didn't need to do that, but the extra mile left me feeling thrilled about Panera, and that location particular -- enough to Yelp about it! 

And the food? Great as always. And the brownie? Yum."}
{"text":"I've never had a problem here. I work nearby and have frequently visited since they opened. I think one time out of 50 my order has been messed up. I don't know why they are ranked so low"}
{"text":"February 17, 2018
Update. I really enjoy ordering thru the drive-thru. Unfortunately, the drive-through sometimes has challenges. I ordered the sausage egg and cheese brioche with the eggs scrambled. I also ordered a large coffee with extra cream and two sweeteners. When I got to the window, she confirmed my sweeteners, took my credit card and paid my bill. Relatively quickly I also received my sandwich and my coffee. Now for the review. The coffee is terrible. Unfortunately you can tell it's been sitting for awhile and it's kind of cooked on itself. The sausage egg and cheese sandwich that I ordered on brioche came out with an over easy egg instead of a scrambled egg the way I had ordered it. Tastes pretty good I'm happy, but it is not what I ordered. I ate the sandwich and tossed the coffee. Still a 3 star rating.

January 28, 2018
Service is hit-or-miss. Sometimes they are super nice and sometimes not very nice at all. The food is always good. I especially like their half sandwich and half soup specials. I order them  frequently for lunch. Today I got their new breakfast sandwich and ordered an egg over easy with sausage on an assagio. Instead of sausage I got brisket. Right there on the receipt, brisket. I will try again because obviously she did not understand what I ordered over the intercom. Today's review is three stars because of the wrong sandwich."}
{"text":"Great location - great food. I'm not usually a \"chain\" fan, but this one is consistently good enough to make me a regular. We like to pick up croissants and bagels here all the time, since it's so convenient. Surprisingly for a franchise, the breads can be quite good. No, it's not as exquisite as a home or boutique-baked bread experience, but it's fast and almost as good! 

Great place to have an informal meeting, since there are so many booths; there's even a conference room available if you have a larger party. In general, we use it for a bit of web surfing while grabbing a quick bite. They list the calories on each order, so you can know what you are ordering.

All-in-all, a good, healthy value, and convenient for people who might be in a rush on some days."}
{"text":"Basic Panera Bread. Nice outdoor seat area with outdoor couches and plenty of tables for guests. Quick service. Can get crowded on weekends. Great location."}
{"text":"Rude general manager, out of half of the things we tried to order.  The bathroom had vomit all over, too.  There was an employee in there who simply scoffed at the matter and then went about business as usual.  Food at least tasted good, but awful experience all around."}
{"text":"Loved this Panera! I went through the drive through at lunch and it didn't take long at all. The food was delicious and the service was wonderful!"}
{"text":"I took the kids here and they both enjoyed the mac and cheese even my picky one! The service was fast even though they had a line! The place was very clean, even the highchairs which usually give away most places! I will have to take the kids here again!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here since they open this location. Today I decided to go since I was in the area and I went through the drive-thru. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, pineapple carrot smoothie and a bear claw. I did not like any of it. The bear claw was not fresh and a little on the stale side. The grill cheese sandwich was cold and the smoothie was just ok. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I always have exceptional service at this Panera. This place has the friendliest staff and the manager Julia is always on top of things. She is an excellent manager and it reflects in her hard working staff. The place is very clean and the service is quick and my orders are always accurate."}
{"text":"If you want to wait an hour for hour to go order then this Panera is for you.  The food is the same as always, no complaints there but in almost a decade eating at Panera across the US, the wait here was the worst."}
{"text":"Always a good solid meal. Usually get to- go. Beth and Taylor are the best at what they do. Outstanding that they remember my name and go out of their way with a warm hello.  In and out in under 15 minutes."}
{"text":"They get a 5 just because their mac and cheese keeps me coming back... absolutely incomparable. Pastries and lattes are not bad either. The new shrimp roll is hard to eat."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's good but it's inconsistent. I like their cobb salad but their mozarella panini and the turkey cranberry sandwich are horrible. Their iced tea also tastes pretty bad. Their pastries are good and service is friendly. It is definitely hit or miss."}
{"text":"Thanks for the salad with NO salad dressing ! This is the second time now ! Lunch ruined thanks"}
{"text":"Fastest delivery experience ever!!! My wife was sick and wanted Panera Bread and we were surprised that they delivered. The website said it would be delivered 30 minutes after checkout. 26 minutes later, a friendly delivery man was at my door with hot soup, sandwiches, etc! Great e-commerce site and delivery team. Website provides calorie count and flexible options. I will order online and delivery in the future. Good job Panera!"}
{"text":"Really really slow service and non friendly staff. The bathrooms are also out of order.

Great layout though!"}
{"text":"I don't know why but the food here tasted so different then other paneras. Wasn't good."}
{"text":"A good, large Panera with a lot of space.  Vine is a little too chill here for my preferences, but it is quiet and very workable.  Regarding that, they have a separate large area for working that includes a conf room with glass doors.  Good to know if that's what you're looking for...

I had the chicken Caesar salad and it was good, but kind of lacking of chicken meat and Caesar dressing.  Most of the bakery products I've had at panera are excellent.  

P.s. Sign up for their rewards program, you'll have a free coffee and pastry in no time.  If you use the app, it's easier to manage."}
{"text":"Despite the not always reliable WIFI and the fact that Panera is an enormous chain...The spacious layout, meeting rooms, and casual business friendly mobile crowd makes for an excellent environment to get work done most of the time."}
{"text":"The wifi is reliable and plenty of space for group meetings or to speak comfortably.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Perfect place to work on a project with a group.  They have a closed off glass room to practice presentations,
Pitch presentations or group meetings."}
{"text":"There is a self service function that is great. The only disappointment was that hey had to keep coming back to me to say they were out of something I ordered. However they did make it up to me and have me free drinks and soup. You do have to clean up your own dishes. It is very busy during lunch time."}
{"text":"I really hate leaving one-star reviews because to be honest, most one-star reviews I read are over dumb complaints.  Let me just say I've been to plenty of Panera Breads before, I like their product, but I've never had negative experience until this location for which I've had multiple. 

I work right by this location, so it's convenient on the way to work and this is my third and final time there.  It's new and I gave it a few chances because I figured they're just getting the kinks out as most new stores of any kind have, and it takes a little time to smooth things out. 

I ordered a large iced coffee with cream and the brioche breakfast sandwich with scrambled egg and sausage.

The coffee was basically all cream with a hint of coffee.  I walked back in over to the pick-up window area and I promise I didn't make a stink.  I tried to be as polite as possible and kept saying I didn't mean to be a pain.  I explained my issue, said I would like a large ice coffee with just a little cream if they could please do something for me.  I waited a couple of minutes, she brought it back out and I swear they must have just brought me back the same cup I handed them without doing anything to it.

It was the lightest shade of tan you can imagine. I tasted it and it tasted exactly the same.  Coffee flavored Ice Cream tasted more like coffee than this did.  I was in a rush to get to work and didn't have time to deal with this.  On my way out the girl at the register asked if it was ok now, I was honest and said it tasted the same then just walked out. 

The sandwich was mediocre and when I bit into it, it was half warm and half cold in parts. Plus, water actually dripped out a little which was odd.  Not sure if anything was frozen to start.

I threw the coffee out and ate the sandwich just to get my sustenance. Then I had to stop at McDonalds of all places to get coffee because I was pressed for time.  Somehow they understood my simple coffee order.

So $14 later, here I am writing this review and I did tip $1 by the way."}
{"text":"I went into labor here in 2006 
A girl named Theresa helped me every time I came in
When I met her, I loved her and hired her as our babysitter for Years. 
She now went on to work at a day care
I miss her! 
Her roommate became a manager there. Very professional
All the managers and staff are. 
I haven't had an issue with this Panera in 10 years. 
The food is delicious. 
Something's overpriced like the macaroni cheese 
But it's impossible to get bad food here. 
The management gets Aplus from me 
Parking is not fun 
Gotta go at the right time"}
{"text":"Sometimes I use Panera as a lunch place and sometimes I use it as an office. Either way I tend to spend a lot of time at Panera. If I am meeting someone I prefer to sit in a booth for more privacy. I like the homey feel of Panera and love it when I get to sit by the fireplace. 
The bakery items are always fresh. It's nice that they keep the chocolate chip cookies warm. Yum!
The food is unpredictable. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not so good. The serving sizes on their soups and salads have shrunk considerably in the last year. They do have a good selection of food. They keep adding healthier options. Their recent addition is Soba Noodle Bowls. They look good but I sense a lot of sodium hides in them. 
If you need a place to meet someone to chat or get some work done it is a good place. Food wise there are many other choices to consider around the city for better food at the same prices."}
{"text":"This is one of the busiest Panera's. I meet a lot of clients at this location. My favorite employee is Pam. She is always cheerful and has drawn a rainbow and butterflies on her name tag. She makes you feel welcomed. 
I enjoy a lot of the foods at Panera but what I order most is the Chicken Cobb salad with Avocado.  And don't forget a chocolate chip cookie that is warm from the oven. YUM. 
It's a great place to sit and read or work. I have seen employers interview people for employment. You see ladies who lunch and young moms stealing a few minutes away for themselves. They have tables and booths, but they also have cushy leather chairs by a fireplace. It's welcoming and homey."}
{"text":"I'm at this Panera once or twice a week and sometimes more. They keep it clean, the employees are nice, but the quality of the food is never consistent.  Even the portion sizes are inconsistent. Sometimes you order a bowl of soup and it comes out like a cup. Sometimes salads fill the bowl and sometimes you get half a bowl. 
I am not a fan of their broth bowls but their Mac n cheese is delicious. It's nice that you get a choice of side-chips, Apple, or roll. I don't know how you can leave without a bakery item. Yum!  Every bakery item is delicious. 
It's a great place to meet friends or clients. It's a great place for families."}
{"text":"Lately anytime I go my order is wrong and my salad is half empty. This is the only my Panera that I have had this problem with"}
{"text":"I'm definitely impressed with the service and food I received at this location of Panera Bread today! My husband and I ordered online for Rapid Pick-up (mostly because I had a $5 reward to use online, but also so we didn't have to wait in line) but decided when we got to the restaurant to dine in instead. Our order was ready and waiting for us on the counter, which we were impressed to see (as we had only ordered about 10 minutes before). 

My husband got the turkey panini and was happy to see that they read his special instructions and left off the mayo. I absolutely loved my mac n' cheese bread bowl. They packaged the mac n' cheese in one container and the bread bowl in a second (probably so it wouldn't be soggy) but I had no problem combining the two. I definitely recommend getting the mac n' cheese bread bowl instead of just the mac n' cheese! It's only $1 more and comes with so much bread that I'll have a carb-filled snack for the rest of the afternoon. 

I was confused to see that there were SO many employees working (at least 10 regular employees, besides 3-4 very official-looking managers), but that just meant that the dining room was extremely clean and well cared for, and all customers seemed to be getting their food promptly. 

Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all by Panera Bread. 

I visited at lunchtime today and picked up lunch to go. 

I ordered The Mediterranean Veggie sandwich. When I opened it up it looked super messy. The pickle was wrapped with the sandwich. The sandwich was soggy. There was simply too much sauce. To make things worse, there was pickle juice in the mix because of the way they wrapped everything together. Overall the sandwich was a disappointment. 

The bag of chips were good though..."}
{"text":"They really do things right here. Made a sandwich I ordered with the wrong bread, but happily replaced it, and gave me a drink and a couple free pastries to go with it. Just get a good vibe from the employees here, always friendly and they always have my pick-up orders ready on time. I really appreciate all of that and that's why I continue to eat here."}
{"text":"This place is just strongly below average across the board. Staff seems upset they have to be there, and that's relayed onto the customer by how they greet you and take your order. Then the sandwiches have about half the ingredients than what you're used to at other Panera Bread locations, even though they charge the same price and call it the same thing. The bread used to make my sandwich tasted like it had been sitting for days, the avocado was not even close to being ripe, the list goes on and on. Avoid this Panera if possible. Would probably recommend the one at The District in Henderson if you want to eat at Panera in LV Valley."}
{"text":"This Panera's nothing out of ordinary, but nothing bad either. Pretty much the same fare as at every other Panera in America."}
{"text":"Don't like the change and no longer get a cookie with the Pick 2. Didn't get out receipt."}
{"text":"Excited to see a new Panera Bread in north Phoenix! And with a drive thru! Although I tend to hang out and do my work with a mocha and one of their awesome pastries or cookies in front of me.  
I enjoy Panera in Iowa when I visit. I have been to the Central Ave location many times. My first visit to this new location only deserves 2 stars but I am going to forget about the slow wifi and my to go order missing a salad and focus on the positive.
Both employees behind the counter were excellent at their jobs and well trained. I had a large to go order with several special requests and the young gentleman handle my order perfectly and seemed so happy to be there and taking my large order. Pretty rare these days. 
The best food to order at Panera is Mac and cheese, soup with a roll and a sandwich on your favorite bread. So many types of bread! I like Pinini or Chibatta (neither of which I know how to spell). And be sure to get a cherry danish or cookie for dessert!"}
{"text":"Food was tasty for a recent lunch [soup,salad, & coffee which was consumed in the restaurant & some pastries & bread to go], but service was GLACIALLY SLOW & HORRIBLE!!!  I am one who tries to find  positive aspects to a situation, but having to wait THIRTY, yes THIRTY minutes from the time we sat down with the pager until we received our order was totally uncalled for. My husband spoke to the manager after 20 minutes, & even though the manager was very kind & apologetic & gave us complimentary cookies when she brought our items 10 minutes later, it definitely put a dark cloud over our anticipation of a nice, healthy lunch @ Panera!  The restaurant was not busy, only 3 other tables with customers, but we are seriously considering never returning to this Panera store again!"}
{"text":"I love Panera bread! Every time I go the food is very fresh and delicious! I absolutely love the broccoli cheddar soup! I've tried all of their salads and they are so good! Love going here for healthy options and is very convenient in this shopping center!"}
{"text":"I spend a lot of time in Panera in meetings. Typically it is clean and comfortable. This Panera is filthy. I will not be back."}
{"text":"My friend was waiting for her food for 30 minutes and when we went to see what was taking so long it was just sitting in the window. The employee wanted her to take it even though it had been sitting there. She seemed disgruntled when we asked for it to be remade. She also didn't even apologize when she threw the food back up into the window."}
{"text":"I use to really like Paradise Bakery. When they changed over the menu started to change. My faves use to be the sandwiches, soup, and my splurge was mac n cheese. Now the soups arent as good. They had to have changed the recipe for their mac n cheese and I dont like it. And some of the sandwiches have weird combos of sauces that ruin it. I think Im done with lunching at panera"}
{"text":"I have not been to Panera in about 2 years. The last time I was here I used the WiFi and got a virus on my laptop. Which was horrible & costly to fix. So I figure enough time has passed & I missed the good food so I stopped in with my step daughter and our kids. We both ordered a soup & sandwich combo. We both had creamy tomato soup which was so yummy. My daugter also enjoyed her veggie sandwich. I had the italian which was ok. The bread was the highlight not the meat. I also had a yummy latte. The boys split a grilled cheese..which looked kinda boring. But whatever..it was for the kids. Our bill was 25 bucks so not that bad since we all left full and happy. I will not wait another 2 years to visit again..but I will never use their WiFi again."}
{"text":"Not sure why this location has such bad reviews. They recently built a building from the ground up to accommodate the business and it is super clean! Everything still has that pristine new look and it's kind of awesome. The tables all have numbers on them so you can sit down, order from the app, and the food just shows up at your table - how did I ever live without this? Never stand in line again! You have total control over if your order is entered correctly and you can even order ahead so it's ready when you get there!!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty much never gotten my call in order 100% correct. I know some people like crunchy cookies but I'm not one of them. I've started going to Corner Bakery a mile down the road because the only thing that's consistent about this place is mediocrity."}
{"text":"The food was fast and fresh but the utensils and bowls the food was served in/with were dirty. We got plastic utensils instead but I didn't see that the bowl was dirty until I was almost finished eating."}
{"text":"I'm surprised with all the negative reviews. The only reason I removed a star is because of the cost. If Panera Bread was more affordable I would frequent more often.

I've gone through the drive thru and also ate inside. Every time I've been there the staff has been friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Make sure to sign up to their loyalty program for the free intro and birthday pastry - the kitchen sink cookie is included and it's super decadent."}
{"text":"I rarely eat at Panera Bread because I'm not that big of a soup and sandwich fan.

BUT, if I am craving a quick and convenient sandwich/ healthy options, I'll return to this Panera Bread. Located conveniently near a Lowes and Wal-Mart, it's hard to pass up while doing errands. I always tend to go with the Pick 2 since I like variety.  The turkey avocado BLT was good (for a sandwich..) and the french onion soup seemed a little salty but still yummy.

I am a fan because of the quick and helpful service here and being close to necessary shopping."}
{"text":"Horrible! Went for a gift card for my 88 year old aunt, and all they had was graduation ones, when I questioned it, I got \"uhhhhhhhh\""}
{"text":"I've got nothing nice to say here, so I'll keep this short. I don't need to deal with your attitude for asking two questions about the menu, nor do I need or even want to deal with your smartass remarks when I simply spelled my name out for you for the order. I would just like to order a sandwich in peace, have a clean table to sit at, but I guess at Panera, especially with Kyle as your cashier, that's a tall order. Food was mediocre, but the service was unnecessarily rude."}
{"text":"This location continues to mess up my order time after time after time but today was the last straw. I ordered a sandwich and 2 of the 5 ingredients were missing. On top of that the avocado on my sandwich was completely unripe and hard. Not to mention there were black spots on the avocado and they somehow managed to leave a huge chunk of the avocado seed still attached to the avocado. Wtf panera."}
{"text":"Not many close by to the strip. This one is close to a huge shopping area. I ordered my caramel Latte and bear claw. My caramel latte was a lil strong than I usually get here in cali. My bear claw was Yummy as usual:-)

The manager was excited and energetic. He made us feel welcomed and didnt even know that we are visitors from cali. 

Compared to Panera in rancho cucamonga, this place was quiet and no waiting lines;-) I will return when I come back in July 2012."}
{"text":"Got in the restaurant and there were two cashiers taking orders and both were busy. After the people in front of me orders, one cashier just leaves and goes do something else while there is a line. But okay, so I waited and when I asked the girl if I could tell her what I wanted in my salad she looked at me like I was from outer space. She wasn't sure I could modify my a salad, so she asked her co-worker if I could do it. Seriously I don't even work there and I know you can but whatever. After the salad dilema I catch the lady making my salad without a glove !! How disgusting is that ( UNSANITARY )?! They should know better, you shouldn't touch food without a freaking glove on. Okay but the best part is that I asked her to put a glove on and she didn't go wash her hands and put the glove on, she just grabbed them and put it on. End of story I have been to SEVERAL Paneras/paradise bakeries and this one was disgusting. If you are working do your job right or don't work. I ended up not eating anything because I was disgusted and scared to get food poisoning. 
1- GLOVES 
2- TRAINING
3- UNSANITARY"}
{"text":"Brand new!
This was a Williams Coffee before it closed, but they have done a great job with the reno!

It is one thing about living by Sherway, no groceries within walking distance. But at least there is a bakery now!
Fresh bread and bagels greet you when you come in. Plenty of registers, so there wasn't a wait. I ordered the smoked turkey, avocado BLT. 

I got mine to go, but the dining room area looked inviting. There is a patio outdoors too. You can just take a seat anywhere when you have ordered.

The to-go area is a bit scrambled right now...I do like how it is away from the registers, but you sort of just stand there. There should be at least a bench or something. It also backs on to a few booths, so if you stand/lean against the wall, you can lean into a booth 

The BLT was great! Massive hunks of avocado, which made my day.
Definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"Favorite lunch spot. Hot soup and sandwiches are my regular! Whether it's to go or dine in, always hot and fresh. Will continue to pop in for lunch at this location."}
{"text":"It's a Panera Bread. It's dependable for a quick bite or a meeting place as usual. Food is well made but small portion for the price of you ask me. I got a coffee here recently in addition to lunch. Meh, coffee seems kind of flat tasting. Maybe it's me but I think McDonalds has a better tasting coffee, bigger and cheaper."}
{"text":"Nope...used to love Panera, but this one and another in Toronto I've been to are not worth the hype.  Skimpy portions and average sandwiches at best.  The bread is supposed to be the highlight, but it's no better than your average supermarket.  Combine that with indifferent service and higher than fast food prices and it's a recipe for a one time visit."}
{"text":"I would normally not post a review for chains, but this location is TERRIBLE! They take 20 minutes for a sandwich even when there's barely any customers there (and that happens repeatedly). Once you get the food, they can't seem to get an order right. Ever! 
If you dare to complain, they can't seem to understand what the issue is. 
They are for the most part perfectly friendly, just not really trained well. Or, maybe simply not the right hires."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the broccoli cheddar here. But sometimes they run out of bread so it makes me sad. The whole dipping your bread in is the best part! Their pumpkin muffin is amazing. Im not a fan of their pasta or sandwiches but i do come here for the delicious pastries and soups!"}
{"text":"Third update, now nowhere to park so off to another restaurant...when is Panera going to build another one close by with more parking and seating like in Sun Prairie?



Second review and same problem... Half the place is full of people on laptops and working ( not eating or drinking) with nowhere to sit so I had to get my order to go."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with fairly quick service and nice food. The biggest problem I find here like all the other Pinera's or St Louis Breed Co's is that its difficult to find a place to sit within 2-3 hrs of lunch or dinner. People find it a great place to park themselves and work away on their laptops or read a book while I wander around with a tray full of food with no place to sit and eat."}
{"text":"Usually when I come here everything is fine, but today was a slow day and it still took a while. I figured they were making my food with love considering the wait time but pictured is the sandwich I received when I opened it up. Smh Panera. The salad was good though so I'll still give it 2 stars"}
{"text":"Food is done very nicely. I had the Chicken Cobb with Avocado and Soba Noodle Bowl with Chicken. The dressing for the salad was perfect, the only complain I have is the egg is a little overcooked. The soba bowl was lovely. The broth was amazing, the chicken was not overcooked, and the soba was nice.
The overall complain, like many others have done, is the price. You definitely get what you pay for, but doesn't make the hit to your wallet easier.
Will I come back? Of course I will.
P.S. to the staff, I apologize for making you feel like I'm impatient with your service staff, it was between shift, and I was hungry, that's why I came to pickup my food as soon as I saw it was ready rather than waiting for it to be deliver to me."}
{"text":"We ate dinner there tonight and it was the best food we've had at this location in a long time!I Asked if they'd changed management and they have. Service was great! Restaurant was clean. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Drove all the way home with our carry out order and sat down to eat, then saw that my sandwich was burned to a black crisp. Super disappointing, especially since I don't live near the restaurant!! I decided to eat my broccoli cheddar soup, which is my favorite, and part of the way into eating it, I found a big hair in it. I was completely disgusted. Not going back there. No excuse for any of this!"}
{"text":"Panera in Mentor is HORRIBLE, don't waste your time or money walking in there. I entered and was immediately attended to for my order, I was at first, Impressed. However, that quickly went away. I ordered a smoothie. The girl had me step aside and wait. I patiently waited for her or anyone to make the smoothie but to no avail. Other employees kept asking to take my order and I repeatedly told them I was awaiting my order. After 10 minutes of waiting I re-approached the original girl and asked her about my smoothie. Her response was, \"oh\". That's it. I then went to another employee, showed my receipt and asked if anyone there could make my smoothie. This girl started to make it then got distracted. 5 more minutes later I asked another girl to make the smoothie in which she complied. 
Customers should no have to stand there and wait 20 minutes for a 60 second smoothie. I will never return to Panera due to their poor service."}
{"text":"Stopped in here last week for a soufflé and some bagels for work. Service was good and friendly, albeit slow. Nothing was forgotten, and it was the standard I expect from Panera bread. 

Also, yes. The soufflé was spectacular."}
{"text":"As far as the food, Panera generally gives you exactly what you expect and nothing more or less. That's part of what I like about Panera is the reliability. While the food generally remains the same at all locations, the staff varies a lot, and the staff at this location was superb. This Panera has one of the friendliest, most helpful staffs I've encountered. As odd as it sounds, the staff made it a joy to grab a bite there. I also really like the layout of the location, as it's set up in a series of 3 rooms, which I think helps keep the noise down. I particularly liked sitting in the front room with the booths, as it was a cozy little nook to do some laptop work while I ate. The only down side is I think the 3 tables in the front room are the only booths in the restaurant. Like I said, Panera is generally Panera, so it's hard to rate them as unique. However the staff and set up of this location will certainly bring me back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"While the food is always good, the staff is the worst. No one has any personality. Everyone just seems like they would rather be literally anywhere else. I get that it's work, which is never your choice place to be, but they could at least smile. Say hi. At least seem happy to see you. The menu knowledge is also not the best. I love Panera, and I eat here all the time. Just wish the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I had seen commercials for the new noodle bowls and was super excited to try them. I Got the soba noodle bowl and it was just okay. Tasted way too much like mushroom. Would have liked more of a chicken flavor, since the description doesn't say anything about mushrooms. I also got the kale salad which has these awesome cheese crisp things on them. Clean environment, but just didn't quite live up to my expectations."}
{"text":"I love and hate PB&C at the same time. Every time I walk in, I'm like, \"oh, I'm so excited, the menu always looks so good and I am so excited to try something new!\" And then I get my food and I am not so impressed. The pick 2 thing is a rip-off, and here's why. For $6.99, you get 2 items (half a sandwich, salad or cup of soup). For $1 more, you can upgrade to a \"signature\" item and for $2 more, you can upgrade both items to a \"signature\" item. But, on the regular menu, it is only 50 cents more for a signature item than a non-signature item. Lame. And the food is never really all that awesome, let's be honest....its the free cookie we come here for."}
{"text":"Took them 30 minutes PAST the pickup time to have my rapid pickup meal ready. Offered no compensation whatsoever - Food was thrown together and my Frozen Mocha was completely melted by the time they gave it to me. I usually come here once a week with coworkers but I'll never be coming back."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! I work across the street so I would come here on a weekly basis and the managers are always so rude when your order is wrong (which it is 90% of the time, and they check off your order which is even worse!!) I tried delivery twice and they gave us the wrong soup one time and forgot the bread bowl the second. I called to ask if they could refund me the money for the forgotten bread bowl and the manager claimed they were unable to do the refund over the phone, it would be over an hour to bring me the bread bowl, and I could come into the restaurant to get my refund. I asked them to bring me my refund when the driver left for his next route, the manager claimed he would take care of it and hung up with out saying goodbye. Needless to say I never received my refund nor will I ever go to this Panera Bread location ever again. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because when the order is correct the food is actually very good."}
{"text":"Today I experienced great waiter service at Panera Bread and the food was just as great! The bread was fresh, everything on my Turkey Bacon Bravo sandwich without the bacon and my broccoli and cheese soup were delicious! The cashiers were a little impatient but I'll forgive them 
: v )  My Apple was juicy!!! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time to study and it's good and everything but my orders were messed up a few times and they don't even apologize for that. They were telling me that what they made is what I ordered. I'm like whaaaaaa?"}
{"text":"Everything that I've had there has been super good love all their soups and sandwiches! Their chocolate chip cookies are to die for and also their iced chai is probably the best chai I've had!!! Everyone is super friendly and they just open and they deliver!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best panera I've been too. The staff is amazing. Especially the cashier ladies. They are rock stars from the food runners to the ambiance of the establishment. This is a great place to come. I always come here before I head to work on the strip."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness paneraaaaa. Panerai is one of the best places ever to eat soup & salad. You can add & remove their ingredients  (how it should be) and their sandwiches don't fall too far behind. They're quick & courteous what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"This will be my first and last visit here. The food was nothing special and definitely not worth the price.
I would consider any other food chain in the Heartland area before trying this again.
There was no problem with the service (it took a little long but staff was friendly), I just do not prefer their food and for a small sandwich with a side of chips (you can exchange for an apple), I did not think it was worth it.

Will not be visiting Panera Bread again."}
{"text":"The key to success for these chain restaurants such as Panera is consistency. People visiting a fast casual restaurant like Panera are looking for fast service at an expected level of quality. Unfortunately, this location seems to have trouble in that area. Customer service at the counter is sometimes confused or slow, although items usually come out of the kitchen just fine.  The food quality is typical Panera. It's just not the best example of the chain."}
{"text":"I love Panera. I'm sad that there aren't more of them here in Vegas. I'd totally hit them up for more lunches.. It's a great alternative to fast food. It's like fresher food fast. I'm not going to lie, some of it can taste a bit processed. But for the most part the soup and sandwiches are spot on.  I recently ordered the steak sandwich. The white cheddar was so thick and creamy delicious..The broccoli cheddar soup is always an amazing experience. Thick, creamy cheddar surrounding chunks of broccoli....yummy!! Ask for a piece of a baguette, it goes fabulously with the soup! My lemonade was not served with a lemon in my cup (like normally)..but I won't hold a grudge..

Have a meeting or just want to spring for a dozen bagels? They are fresh and tasty.. I love the asiago cheese.. Mmmmmm.. 

There are all sorts of baked goods, check it out... Service is friendly and attentive. I'll be back super soon!"}
{"text":"It took forever to get through the line and then to order.  My favorite sandwich is the bacon turkey bravo and my favorite soup is the broccoli cheddar.  When my food was delivered to my table the soup wasnt very warm.  Panera Bread makes me miss Paradise Bakery.  I am accustomed to getting a cookie with my meal but not here at Panera Bread.  Their whole process just seemed very slow and maybe it's because it's a new location with new employees. Well, its been a while now and their customer service still sucks. Every time the wife wants to go here I cringe because I know that it may be a while to order. The drive thru is a nightmare and I have been stuck in line a couple times waiting for what seemed like forever. One time someone changed their order after getting to the window to pick up their food and instead of having the person wait in the parking lot they just had them waiting at the window until the order was changed. Do not go to Panera Bread unless your wife makes you go."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every person that works there is happy and friendly.  They know their menu items well.  Chicken Caesar salad is the bomb,"}
{"text":"So today, my company had several box sandwich lunches catered for a corporate meeting. The sandwiches were dropped off at 10:50am, I opened my box immediately and the bread on my Mediterranean veggie sandwich was so soggy it was inedible. How long did you guys drive around with my sandwich in your car? What time was the sandwich actually made? I work on Howard Hughes, your location is on Howard Hughes. According to Google maps I'm 3 minutes (0.6 miles) away. There's no way my sandwich should be this old when delivered that the bread is soggy, and mine wasn't the only one. I had to throw the sandwich away. This is unacceptable."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite healthy restaurants to eat at. It is 100% clean sandwiches and salad place and I absolutely love their Chipotle Chicken Avocado Melt sandwich on sour dough bread or their whole grain bread. It is my favorite sandwich of all places!! Also I like their Cream of Chicken and Wild Rice soup. I've tried their Cheddar Broccoli and Baked Potato soup and they are good as well. 

Get the app for fast ordering and free items like drinks and dessert for your birthday. I've received a few free drinks already so well worth getting the app.  

Service is pretty quick. Not really sure if they are friendly because I usually just order on the app and pick it up.  It is a nice place to eat at too because there are lots of places to sit either outside or inside."}
{"text":"You pick 2 combo is great for the price...lots of fresh and healthy selections.  I love going there for breakfast ;-)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Panera Bread location. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating! One of my salads was made incorrectly, but when I brought it to the supervisor's attention, Hayli, she quickly remade my salad and gave me a free bakery item. The food, service, and atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"It's a Panera. Y'all know the broccoli cheese soup is tasty, the cinnamon crunch bagels are insanely good and the sandwiches, albeit moderately sized, are typically pretty bad for you. Just sayin'....

Nonetheless, if I'm in SouthPark and need to drop in for a bevvie and plow through a bit of work, this location suits me just fine. The employees are really sweet and they pretty much leave you alone if you're working away...

Other pertinent info...

The parking: Can get pretty stacked in the little lot shared by Panera, AT&T, etc. Park carefully. 

The space: Plenty of tables, booths and whatnot to saddle up and get through some work. You can score free WiFi through Panera, or you can likely latch on to AT&T's WiFi too."}
{"text":"Panera beckons you from the road with its crazy good broccoli cheddar soup and cinnamon crunch bagels. Separate, of course. Never eat those together. Plus, free wifi, smiley employees and plenty of seating. Oh, and I really dig that the calorie content is listed on the menus now! 

So, why not four or five stars for this location? The.Parking.Is.Horrendous. It's awful. I've been to this Panera many a time and every single visit I'm dodging cars, honking my horn to avoid someone backing into me or generally just being annoyed that there is very, very limited parking - even if you drive around back. I like you Panera, but it's really tough to continue this relationship if we want to see each other during lunch hours."}
{"text":"I love the half soup and half sandwich deals. The food is super delicious and offered at a fair price. This time I had the chipotle chicken melt, it was delicious. The cheese was melted perfectly on the perfectly heated sandwich."}
{"text":"This panera bread  is the worst I have ever been to.  The half sandwich was 2 1/2 inches  and their  salad box was  half full.  I have been to several others  but never  got such small  amount  for the  money $ 9.38."}
{"text":"The freshest fuji apple salad ever, Panera never disappoints, is consistent and delicious. The cashier was the friendliest yet down to earth and they should give her a raise for being such a good representation of customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered a sandwich for delivery, waited over an hour and a half and called the manager to ask where the driver was. I specifically put in the instructions the name of the business to deliver, however they claimed that they \"could not find the store\". I asked them to re-deliver and they told me it would be another hour.. unbelievable. Just take my advice and get Jimmy Johns."}
{"text":"It is been two years that I can't just try something else other than chicken frontega + Broccoli cheddar! I enjoy it always and ever!"}
{"text":"I wish this was Paradise Bakery instead of Panera. They don't have a southwest chicken caesar salad here..so I just got a small greens salad. It was $4! for a tiny bowl of leaves. On a different visit I opted for soup and got a really stale piece of bread with it. If you come here at night, bring a sweater, it's freezing inside!"}
{"text":"An absolute must for visiting the mainland. Panera has some very delectable options and this one was no exception. Met all of my visit criteria with flying colors. 

1. Greeted and acknowledged upon entry is a must. It's the initial feeling of receiving basic hospitality. It's the first step of good care, welcoming attitude and friendly demeaner.

2. Clean environment screams welcome, gratitude  for patronage and respect. It shows that order and care are placed in the environment that you will be in. It shows that your welfare and health are important.

3. Confidence and value in your product. It means much more than being aware of what you have to offer, but know that what you're offering, selling is worth my time and money. Value your customers enough to not just strive to be better, but being the actual best and giving your customers the desire to return for future visits.

Panera, you have met all of the criteria above and I truly wish we had a Panera in Hawaii. I will return to your establishment when I return to Las Vegas.  Until then, keep up the good work and rock them 5 stars, you deserve very single one of them!!"}
{"text":"It's Panera so you get a great coffee and quite the selection of bread and pastries. Dark and light roast coffee selections with the brew time right on the outside of the carafe so you know what's fresh. The apple crunch muffin was very good and enough for breakfast. Lots of high schoolers in here after Charlotte Catholic lets out"}
{"text":"I never like panera and the only thing I got there is drinks cuz i have free gift cards.
7 dollars for half a sandwich is just not my thing"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Panera; it has decent food, is spacious, and has a good atmosphere for studying. It's a little pricey for what it is but I don't come here all the time so it's okay. 

NOTE: WiFi is very slow (compared to mcd/starbucks/Timmie's)."}
{"text":"I love panera and the choices they have to offer. It is a chained restaurant but everyone is a little bit different. The food is always fresh and if I have to eat out I choose panera because of their healthy, delicious choices. 

A couple of my favorites are their Turkey BLT with avacado on sourdough bread, the Greek quinoa salad, and their green passion smoothie that has spinach and fruit juice in it. 

Whenever we have to go out to lunch for work, I always suggest panera because I know it won't be greasy and make me feel gross for the rest of the day. If you are looking for a healthy \"fast-food\" type of restaurant, then this is your choice. Don't forget to do rapid pick up and order online. It's a life savor. 

So this is the beginning of my edited review. The first couple trips I have had there were great. But lately, it's gone down hill fast. It started with doing an online order and two things getting left out - my cookie and the dressing for the salad. I ignored it because people forget all the time and I'm not a hard customer to please but then two more incidents have occurred. 

The first since that is I can't have cheese so I ask for spinach instead. When I opened my breakfast sandwich, I kid you not here were 4 or so pieces of spinach that didn't even cover the whole piece of bread. I know this is lame of me to call this out but come on. 

The second thing is when I ordered my salad, it was less then half full in the box. Panera is not cheap and I expected to be full after one of their salads and when I opened the box to eat it for lunch, it was unflavorful and disappointing. 

I really hope they start stepping up their game again."}
{"text":"By Panera standards, this one was just average. They weren't out of anything we ordered (like several other reviews have mentioned, although this was an earlier-in-the-day lunch visit) and the staff was friendly enough, but I did get the feeling that they'd rather not be working. As a vegetarian, I've always been disappointed by the menu selection at Panera. My Mediterranean veggie sandwich was a bit sloppily made, but tasted normal.

The absolute worst part of this Panera experience was the espresso bar. I ordered a cappuccino and it was probably the worst I've had in my life. Weak espresso, way too much milk, and almost no foam. It tasted like a very weak cafe au lait. I don't know who trained this girl, but she obviously had no idea what she was doing.

I have higher expectations for Panera and would only return here if I was in good company to distract me from the experience."}
{"text":"Love Panera! Delicious food and great service. Good location! A+"}
{"text":"Love Panera! This is a good location and the food was fast in coming out. Only complaint is that the folks behind the counter could communicate better in asking is it for here or to go."}
{"text":"One of the best Panera Bread's I've been in. Super clean. Plenty of seating and the customer service was perfect. A+"}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Breakfast sandwich was delicious. It came out to me pretty quickly. Fast service. No complaints. Would return to this location again."}
{"text":"Its so cozy here, perfect place to stop and clear my head before a hard days work!  Usually they have someone walking around with souflee samples, i was out of luck today :( Panera bread is at the top of my list for interesting & hearty soups plus they have a mean sweet selection.  I am into the tasty coffee cake! 
I heart this place so much, i am able to give them a good review, eventhough my multi colered hair cashier was a complete NINCOMPOOP!"}
{"text":"Ever since the name change everything has been going down hill and today it hit a new low.  I ordered chipotle chicken avocado melt and when I got ready to a bite I looked at the avocado and it covered in black dots...  I pulled the top off the sandwich and saw all the avocado was covered black dots.  When the produce starts to rot don't serve it or if you wouldn't eat it don't serve it."}
{"text":"I come here all the time when I'm feeling like a lazy cook and want to eat something fresh and easy.  Friendly and quick staff.  Spacious and quiet environment too."}
{"text":"The Panera tastes pretty good, not anything significantly different from other Paneras. The drive thru is nice but as a fair warning, Panera is not particularly a \"fast\" food so you might have to wait a bit at the window. Overall, it's a nice clean place for brunch or lunch."}
{"text":"I love Panera but this location is terrible. Worst service ever. Woman at the drive thru seemed annoyed when taking my order, didn't read the order back, or give a receipt. The order was wrong. I pulled back into the drive thru and received an even more annoyed response as I tried to explain what was missing in the order. She replied with with what they'd put in on their end as if I'd screwed it up (even though she had corrected my pronunciation of the missing salad when I ordered it). I then pulled  up to a closed window and waited until a different woman (I presume the manager) opened the window and said 'there's your salad' like she was doing me a favour. Thanks. Sorry to have for disturbed you (twice) with my order. If I'd known I was so unworthy of your time and effort, I'd have gone elsewhere. And next time I will. Anything is better than spending $15 for a salad and having to throw it out because I don't trust that someone didn't spit in it. Seriously, if you have no respect for the people you're serving, I can't imagine how you treat the food. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Located in Boca Park in Las Vegas NV.

This place is very clean and the staff was super friendly.
I had the pick 2 which is a half of sandwich and a salad.

My strawberry poppyseed and chicken salad was very fresh and quite filling. The green iced tea was a little too sweet for my liking, It reminded me of Kool Aid or a melted popsicle taste. Just not my thing.

Overall I would highly recommend this location for a fresh healthy alternative to fast food or burgers of some sort. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Close to the house Mobile Order is a breeze. Great food selections even though I only eat the Fuji Chicken Salad..Boyfriend gets the Chicken Frontega and he likes it and his very very picky lol"}
{"text":"I like Panera for a healthy lunch.  I ordered 2 salads to go and picked them up and left with out checking on them.
Mistake. They were much smaller than usual and didn't contain the extra dressing I had wanted. Maybe new untrained staff??
Not a good thing to doubt my order."}
{"text":"Out of this, out of that.. inappropriate dialogue between staff and not very attentive. I dont know what else to say.. i had a not so pleasant experience. Not to mention my mediocre sandwich and salad totaled out to be $21 i shoulda went to red lobster.... hahahahaha"}
{"text":"This location has their act together. So much better than the one downtown. And they a drive thru, online ordering and rapid pickup which is very convenient. The food is good and the interactions with the servers has been great."}
{"text":"So, several months ago I try to order the Power bowls and the staff wasn't trained and could not even work the register and then tired to say i was thinking of another restaurant,  today I gave then a second chance,  I wanted one of the Flatbread sandwiches and they were out of flatbread. It's definitely not worth the drive."}
{"text":"We love it here! I can order anything on the menu and just know that its going to be delicious. fresh and clean food makes you feel good all day. the orange scones are very wonderful and u can buy bread by the loaf. thank you panera!"}
{"text":"Great place to come for a quick healthy lunch or a place to study for a few hours. Food is constantly good for semi fast food. Service is always fast and good. Cobb salad is my personal fav."}
{"text":"Horrible service!

I went into Panera Bread on my lunch break and ordered half a sandwich and a bowl of soup. After ten minutes I asked for a refund because I knew I would not have enough time to sit down and enjoy the meal. 

I went to the cashier to ask for a refund, she called the manager over to speak with me. While I was speaking with the manager he actually walks away. I had to call for him to come back and finish the refund."}
{"text":"This was my FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT. Emphasis on was. I took all my friends and family here and recommended it to them all. But. 
My favorite meal (and one of the few that is safe for my dairy allergy that I actually would enjoy) the turkey chili bowl was discontinued. They say it's going to come back next year. But for me that's a whole year without my favorite meal from my former favorite restaurant. 
And that's IF it comes back. 
BTW if you're going to mark it off of the menu board, mark it off of the kids menu too so there is less confusion. 
-Sad and disappointed Allergy customer here."}
{"text":"I love Panera! It's somewhere I go religiously! I was really upset when they discontinued the steak and blue cheese salad. When we went I saw that they had put it back on the menu, and I was so excited to have it in my life again! 

When I got the salad I noticed something was missing! They didn't have the blue cheese chunks! Also, they put A LOT of dressing. It was drenched! They are normally the best at making my salads but just a little thrown off today! 

I also got the bread bowl soup which is always sooooo good! Especially on cold days! 

I love this location because it had so many outlets and free wifi!"}
{"text":"I was at work and needed a quick bite to eat early in the morning.  Thankfully, Panera was open so we stopped really quick.  I ordered a quick bagel and cream cheese.  The bagel was sliced and toasted perfectly and was ready in no time.  I was able to put my cream cheese on as much or as little as I'd like which was nice.  Some places put the spread on themselves.  Before I knew it, it was back to work.  The bagel was easy to eat on the go and not too messy.  The location was clean and the staff very friendly.  The smells of freshly baked pastries and coffee filled the air and made me want to sit in one of the comfy looking chairs they had.

I will definitely keep Panera in mind when I need another quick breakfast."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend after a traumatic day of sorting through a car after a bad accident. Was a great place to come because the restaurant was warm and inviting. We quickly ordered and sat at our table. It was extremely busy but we were able to find a table with a view outside. Our food came promptly and everything looked great. The warm feeling that the comfort food and atmosphere had was great. Overall a wonderful experience. Looking forward to another trip hopefully under better circumstances. Maybe even pick up some bagels!"}
{"text":"Rapid pick up my a$$, last 2 times they messed up my order, it's never there, Worse I have to proof the manager I made my order, of course she has a bad attitude  I love Panera but this location is terrible!!"}
{"text":"I think the Panera down the road on Route 306 is better. It's bigger and cleaner. I went in on Saturday for a Chocolate Chip bagel, the lines were long and they didn't have any chocolate chip bagels less. I settled with a pumpkin bagel, overly the bagel was good. I just wish it was cut better. It was cut so thin part of my bagel was ripped off. The restaurant needs to be cleaner."}
{"text":"Went again cause I had a coupon. Same situation, dirty tables, flies in the restaurant, dirty napkin, thrown here and there. They also forgot croutons in my tomato soup. Not a bad place if they clean it up a bit."}
{"text":"Today was the third occasion with a ruined meal. Our office decided to give it a second (and final) chance today. The chicken in my salad was STILL FROZEN. The management is rude and unapologetic, no matter how many times, documented, that they have gotten our orders wrong. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Unbelievable poor service. Cashier screwed up order. I asked for straws from the wait staff and they returned with one. There were literally six of us sitting there. I then said I need 5 more, he returned with 4. I then asked for 1 more and he brought the sack of straws. The food, of course, came out wrong because of the cashier, we then returned it. It seems like the entire store staff was ran by 12 year olds. We are finished eating here. The food was typical tasting for Panera."}
{"text":"This review is for takeout/catering. Salad and sandwiches were on offer, with sides of pickle spears and little bags of potato chips (which I ignored completely, sorry to potato chip fans who need to know).  

This was the first time I remember having Panera Bread Co. sandwiches. They were small, so I picked two:  avocado BLT and Mediterranean veggie. They were notably colorful, fresh and delicious. I noticed there wasn't a whole lot of filling, but the fillings were so strong that it wasn't overwhelmingly bready.  No one goes to Panera for low-carb, but I was impressed with their cleverness at choosing, for example, feta cheese instead of mild cheddar. It doesn't take much feta to flavor a sandwich. 

I am not a pickle connoisseur, but I thought the pickle spear was acceptable. I passed on the salad -- currently the news is full of stories of E. coli-contaminated Romaine lettuce and people in dire straits health-wise, so it seemed foolish to push my luck. I think there was lettuce in the sandwiches, but I decided to ignore that and just enjoy the meal... I hope that's not famous last words!"}
{"text":"Had a chicken salad n soup. All over good experience. This is not my last visit. I am lovin it."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, real food served here.  Love the lunch mix and match options for sandwich and soup or salad.  And now they deliver!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Shockingly bad service and food. Stale bread, French onion soup with no cheese. Bad attitudes with verbal acknowledgment that she didn't care that she was providing bad service. I ordered a kids meal and they had literally told me that they didn't feel like making any more soup. So I asked it I could have the kids meal and he tried to give my only part of it. And then they wouldn't give it to us until we accepted the sad half prepared soup. Otherwise clean."}
{"text":"Panera Bread is my go-to for lunch hour whenever I'm around this area. It's a quick and convenient place to eat. It's also convenient for UNLV students because it's near the university.

I usually order the Pick 2. Today I ordered the asian sesame salad without chicken and the summer corn chowder. I'm assuming it's a seasonal soup because I didn't see it on the menu the last time. I was so excited to try it!

This was also the first time I tried the asian sesame salad and it was delicious. I loved the dressing, but I wish Panera added in edamame to this salad. It was delicious, regardless! The soup was alright, I'm going to be honest.  I loved the flavor, but the corn chowder wasn't so chowder-y. The chowder wasn't thick at all, but more soupy. I'm just hoping it's not soupy for other locations."}
{"text":"I love Panera's!  They truly have some great food and dessert selections for those that want to eat in at a comfortable, fast-food, self-serve setting.  And their employees are friendly and hard working.  Their Mediterranean veggie sandwich is great.  I love their 'you pick 2' option as well, and their selection of unique 'hole-less' bagels and scrumptious pastries for breakfast.  However, I have to hold back at least a star due to the fact that I often find their coffee machines and cream and milk dispensers empty.  How hard is it to have an employee making sure that coffee and cream is available, especially during morning busy hours where customers rely on their java fix?!  In addition, they charge $8.50 for their new pasta dishes.  You should see how small the portions are.  Ripoff!"}
{"text":"This place deserves at least 4 stars. I come here just about every day and the food is always so good. Their Mac and cheese is one of the best mac & cheeses I've had. I also get their Fuji apple salad but modify it slightly. It's so delicious. I love how you can order on a kiosk now and don't have to wait in line and it can save your order which I love. I've been to other Panera locations and this one is by far the best. Service is prompt and everyone working is so nice and friendly. Because we eat here so much they always give us fresh cookies right from the oven! I love it."}
{"text":"I generally don't write reviews but the service at this location is incredibly slow and the staff unprofessional.  Granted it was a Friday night at 9:30, but the staff seemed more intent on socializing with each other than preparing my Rapid Pick-Up order.  Given the plethora of other choices in the area, this Panera location will struggle if it does not improve on customer service.  As a frequent customer, I am questioning my loyalty to the chain, given the amount of choices in the area, if they continue with such poor service."}
{"text":"It's nice to finally have a Panera Bread on this side of Lorain County. I love the way this location is set up. There are lot's of nooks and crannies to relax in especially if you want to utilize their free Wi-Fi. As far as Panera Bread's go this location is fairly large and has ample seating. They even have an outdoor patio. I would highly recommend trying one of their sandwiches with a nice bowl of soup and then getting a bagel or pastry for dessert. . The food is always good quality and I have never had any issues with them making something incorrectly. Any time I have any concern the managers are available to listen to what I have to say.

There are a few seats that have an accessible outlet, but I would bring an extension cord if you need a plug....just in case! To me, this is the only downside of this location. 

If you are looking for a location in Lorain County to do some work on your computer and need free Wi-Fi I would definitely give this Panera Bread location a try."}
{"text":"The Panera Bread in Avon is not my favorite location in Lorain County, but it's not bad either. The service and food is pretty consistent. Can't go wrong with ordering a cup of soup, a sandwich or a salad. I also enjoy their baked goods and bagels. 

One of my least favorite things about Panera Bread in general is that they have a WIreless Internet restriction during their peak hours ...11:30-1:30 (I believe). They have a 30 minutes time limit for Wireless use during that time period. I understand why they have the policy, but I think it's a bit extreme nonetheless. I have never seen a Panera Bread so busy during peak hours that the Internet users were keeping other customers away from having a table to sit at.  

One other thing I like about Panera is that they have a dietary restrictions binder. My boyfriend has to eat a gluten-free (GF) diet, and while Panera doesn't have an extremely large selection of GF items, it is still nice that they have the information available for their customers. There are quite a few salads on their GF list, and it appears that almost all of their salad dressings are GF as well. In addition, a few of their soups are also GF. If  you need to observe a strict diet due to food allergies just ask the cashier and they can show you the binder of information. 

All in all Panera Bread is a decent place to eat if you want something better than fast food, but not quite as nice as a sit-down restaurant. It's a little pricey for what you get, but it is also consistently good! I enjoy coming to this location when I need a place that has WiFi. It can be a bit noisier than a coffee shop, so I would suggest bringing a pain or headphones if you need to concentrate. This is especially true during the lunch and dinner hour time frames."}
{"text":"Consistently clean and accurate.  If they do mess something up, they will be sure to fix it.  Not a fan of the new flat bread sandwiches, but everything else is good."}
{"text":"I had a super impressive experience at this Panera yesterday. I ordered the Mac n Cheese. It is so creamy and delicious. Towards the bottom of my bowl there was a small piece of plastic. Sort of like the kind you would find on a freezer bag. I handed to the manager walking by. She did not say much when I gave it to her so at first I was kind of miffed. Then in a few minutes she returned with a cash refund for me. She apologized for what happened and I was happy with her response. What happened next was what really impressed me. A young man came out from behind the counter with a fresh meal for me. Knowing I had eaten most of my food already he brought some to go containers as well. They went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of."}
{"text":"Inconsistent is the word that best describes this location. Vastly inferior to the spot near Square One. Other have pointed out the small portion sizes and that is often but not always the case. There is really no excuse for inconsistency at there prices."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch at 8:20 on a Sat morning specifically because my wife wanted a souffle. They had one left and no more in the oven? Really? Like KFC with no chicken? I spoke with the manager and although he looked like he was 12 years old, he was friendly and helpful. He apologized, deducted 30% from our bill and got more in the oven so that we could at least take a couple home after we finished our coffee. At least he tried."}
{"text":"Free WiFi, clean upscale version of Starbucks. Soups, sandwiches, salads.  Baguette bread is full of flavor and chewy. Known to bake their own breads & pastries.

Seen too many of these types of restaurants popping up all over the area, food decent but nothing really special except for their breads/pastries"}
{"text":"Really good and delicious soups and salads their bread bowls are amazing and tea  they location is very nice and in a great shopping mall center great customer service everyone was very nice and quick service"}
{"text":"They have screwed up an order (in minor ways) from time to time BUT have always fixed it and apologized as well. The food is always so good, the location is great, the staff is great and you get your food in such a speedy manor. There is a guy manager there with a shaved head......i just have to point it out that the guy is the most hands on manager i have ever seen in my life and especially for a panera. The guy is always super upbeat, he interacts with customers, he makes awesome reccomendations, always fixes mistakes with a smile on his face. Ive seen this guy tackle the kitchen/drinks and counter when they are understaffed. What manager does all that ? Seriously that guy honestly makes that place for me. I go out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"Panera is always consistently good. No matter if I'm in Vegas or Cali I have liked the good I get. My company uses them for catering at times and like that food as well.  

I have eaten at several in Las Vegas and always gravitate toward this one when I'm in the mood for Panera. Not sure if it's the size, that it always a little busy, or that it's in the district, but I really like this place. 

This store staff are very nice. My four use old has dropped her bagel here two on separate occasions and both times someone behind the counter just brought us another without being asked. 

If you find yourself in the district check out this Panera."}
{"text":"The food is always good, that is why I am giving 2 stars. The service needs much improvement."}
{"text":"Size of portions and quality seems lower than other Panera locations across GTA. However the real reason for negative review is server/staff's indifference and general lack of courtesy, let alone being friendly (especially in the morning). At 8 am, they sound like they are ready to go home.

Coffee here is usually 1 hour too stale, but then again most Panera locations never seem to have hot and fresh coffee. Something to do with their big coffee pots maybe?

This location is not the best one out there, so go there is you must."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. It is serve yourself ordering and they bring your food to you. I ordered the 1/2 Turkey and Avocado  BLT and the Fuji Apple and Chicken Salad and ice tea.  It cost $13.00. I could have added a sweet treat like big cookies or pastry for $.99 but passed this time.  I got some ice tea and sat by the window.  It was about 2 pm and it was about 1/2 full of customers.  It took about 15 minutes and it arrived.  The sandwich was very tasty and the turkey was roasted and real turkey (not that deli stuff)  and fresh avocado sliced and bacon, though it was on the small size.  The only thing on the white bread was the crust  was very chewy and limp.  The salad was pretty good size and really good with every kind of green you could imagine and pecans, a little crumbled cheese, chicken and a nice dressing. I am not a big salad eater, but this was really yummy.  The whole lunch was really refreshing, and though I was full (couldn't finish the whole salad) I wasn't weighted down and ready to take a nap.  If you register a little card they give you for rewards etc, you receive free tea, soda or coffee for a month.  I really liked my lunch.  It was not fancy inside but modern, clean, and everyone was very nice.  I plan on going there for lunch again real soon."}
{"text":"I first went to Panera during the opening and it was super chaotic... They were still getting into a groove and employees were still learning everything 
My visit then wasn't very memorable 
I think I got one of the pasta dishes which I didn't enjoy... It reminded me of hospital food... Small portion as well...

Today I went and got the Fuji chicken apple salad... I liked it, great size and flavor... Better than their sides and sandwiches... As I was waiting for my order I could hear the girl yelling out her confusion on how to make the salad and some other orders... I know that this is common (not the yelling, but the new employee) but it was kinda nerve-wrecking hearing her and wondering if she was going to get my order right or not... I am usually not one to complain about things like this but I think just because I heard her own uncertainty, it made me a little more nervous... I made sure to check my take out order before I left...

The layout is nice and the dining areas are set up well but I don't get the pick up area, why put that right in the middle of the restaurant... I'm sure that gets packed and hectic when it's busy (I haven't seen it busy)

One of the main things that keeps my visits spread out is the price... Pretty steep, for the food you get at least... 

I think I'll stick to salads and cookies at this joint..."}
{"text":"I live near the Panera on Rampart but tried this location as I was in the area. Three stars because the staff was very sweet. I ordered a half and half. I didn't specify what type of cheese and my grilled cheese came with American that wasn't good quality.  The soup was lukewarm and that wouldn't have been so bad if my hot chocolate wasn't piping hot -not a good combination. I went in for Wi-Fi and before I ordered I asked if they had Wi-Fi. The girl that took my order asked another girl and she said \"yes\" they did. When I went to use the Wi-Fi it wouldn't work.  There are plenty of other places in the area with Wi-FI.  I needed to get online. After my meal I ended up parking near Starbucks- which is in the same shopping center-  and getting on their Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"Used to LOVE panera until the other day I got my mac n cheese FILLED with hair. Not one, not two but a lot of hair pieces in it. I was disgusted and will be telling everybody I know to beware."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for lunch if I go during the off-peak lunch time (2p-3p). It's always crowded here and the seating is pretty nonexistent. I've always had friendly servers, so maybe the other reviewer had people on an off day. 

The food is usual Panera stuff, which means delicious. As a general comment about Panera, I wish the selections would change out a little more frequently.

Beware, parking during the lunch rush can be very hard to find, as the parking lot on this side of the strip mall is very limited."}
{"text":"I'm a downright Panera lover. Salad, Mac & Cheese, Sandwich, you name it, I'll eat it. One thing that I noticed about this location over others is that even though seats are limited, the area to order is a lot more spacious than the location at Galleria Mall. I also noticed that the service was  really quick. Order time to getting my sandwich was within 5 minutes. There could probably be an extra person or two cleaning the tables but I'm not complaining. I'll definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!!! Can't go wrong with Panera. The thing that urks me most is the single door entrance/exit...this place needs double doors with all the people going through it!"}
{"text":"Service was quick.  Got my standard BBQ chicken salad and it was good but could have used a little bit more of dressing.  I had asked for the baguette as my side, but it came out with a yogurt.  The person bringing out my meal seemed annoyed at this fact, but did remedy the situation by bringing me a piece of baguette.  I also had a chocolate chipper cookie which was good but definitely not baked fresh that day as the edges were way hard/stale."}
{"text":"If you have any gluten allergy, I would not recommend eating here. Unfortunately when I have order takers asking me if cheese is gluten- It's a little disconcerting to say in the slightest. I have an intolerance to gluten and am always looking for a safe place to eat; I want to help others find or steer away from places to go. I do not feel the need to attack anything other than this warning to others; however there were several things that left an upset stomach and bad taste in my mouth regarding this experience."}
{"text":"While the food is good, service was horrendous!  We tried ordering at the kiosk, were only able to order breakfast sandwich. Then had to stand in line for 10 mi it's a to order a bagel & coffee.  The breakfast sandwich came while in line. Ridiculous,  took another 15 minutes after sitting down to get Bagel and coffee.  Last time in here. No one working had any need for speed or to help out.  I highly suggest passing on this location."}
{"text":"Such a nice place to study!  Has free wifi and delicious food. In the winter they have a nice fireplace that you can gather around and have a nice time with friends. Usually fairly quiet so you can study. There are booths that line the large windows to give you a peek into the outside making it seem so pretty to watch the snow fall while sipping on hot soup with a baguette. The only bad part is that there always are people looking around for the booths with the outlets. If it's a busy time and you need an outlet, you may be out of luck. But you can always grab a delicious hot sandwich or a cup of hot cocoa and wait for one to open up."}
{"text":"Just picked up two simple breakfast bagels, cheese egg and sausage. Nothing was more than lukewarm, cheese not melted, sausage no flavor and almost cold. Girl making sandwiches was non communities, no smile... churlish. Should have driven the extra 5 minutes to Brueggers. Won't make that mistake again. Ended up tossing $12  worth of food in the trash! Truly a lousy Panera!"}
{"text":"I realize you're going to overpay at a chain like Panera, but you at least expect consistency and decent service. The employees at this Panera make it far more complicated than it needs to be. Let's start with the ordering process. Not everyone wants the ingredients on a specific menu sandwich. How hard is it to make a plain turkey with lettuce tomato and onion on a French baguette? Apparently harder than you think. Variations should be simple, but the person at the register struggled to make the change. So let's move to the second phase. The person making the sandwich struggled and missed the fact that it was a large (meaning two half sandwiches had to be made.) The third person who bags everything (when she takes time away from talking to fellow employees) at least realized the mistake and then had to step in and redo the order. 
Panera is what it is, but a three stage process (ordering, making and handing it over) that's designed to promote efficiency and consistency is clearly not working."}
{"text":"I wish they had a drive thru but you can't have it all I suppose. The food is fresh and tasty according to my 3 year old daughter who is a discerning foodie. (Nothing pleases her more than a steak & a crisp Caesar Salad) All kids meals must have a good toy to meet her expectations. I like this location but prefer the one in Boca Park. This one is closer so we shall return.

{"text":"I had the worst experience at this Panera Bread location and the supervisor on duty this morning did not resolve my issue. I had ordered my lunch at about 10:30 am today to arrive and pick up at 11:35 am in the dot. As usual i arrive a couple of minutes earlier. I was extremely excited to have a nice warm soup upon my arrival. When i approached the staff at the counter they kept telling me that they were working on my order 10 then 20 mins past and nothing yet. At this point i was done i asked for the supervisor and all i got was \" i can cancel your order if you no longer want it\" i proceeded to cancel my order to get reimbursed. I was not given any other options other than to wait much longer for my order to be ready. ... This definitely defeats  the purpose of ordering online, when in reality it took twice as long the wait time. What a waste of time. If anyone cares my order was #177822439 ."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. The two free kiosks were broken, then I ordered decaf and it came out caffeinated. Then they seemed annoyed to have to remake it and didn't apologize for their error. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Come here all the time with my bestie. Today was no different. We got our usual, and this time had an issue with my food. Not normal to have issues, so I brought my dish up and the manager greeted me (sweet older woman, I can not remember her name) she was very prompt and apologetic and had my food remade immediately. After receiving my food, she came over with cookies and coupons for 2 meals for our next visit. I had no intent of writing a review for my visit until she showed such professionalism and care, in making sure I was taken care of! Great job Panera!!"}
{"text":"Standard Panera. I spent the majority of the day studying here. There is a lot of seating and a nice fireplace for when it's cold. The staff was very friendly and seemed to enjoy making conversation with customers. They also seemed to get along well with one another. My food came out quickly and correctly and I didn't have any issues. The wifi is free and many people come to study or relax, and it's the perfect spot for it. My only complaint would be the parking. There are metered street spots and free one hour parking behind the restaurant, but if you are planning to stay for a while to study or for something else, you don't have many options. Overall a friendly atmosphere and a great place to work or soc"}
{"text":"I would give this place 4 stars except for one exception...the number of times I have to go pick up my food that has been sitting at the counter and nobody around to deliver it. When your're on a lunch hour these things matter. I don't know where the employees are and after about 3-4 minutes I'll get up and get it myself. May have to find a new location."}
{"text":"The service at this location is terrible. The rapid pickup is never ready on time or anywhere near the promised time."}
{"text":"Panera is a great spot to go to for breakfast OR lunch. Even when it is super busy the line moves pretty quickly, and their food is always on point. In particular, their soups and salads are really good. And if you go for breakfast you HAVE to get the pumpkin muffin top - YUM!!!"}
{"text":"The weekday lunch manager of this Panera location is a case study in how to chase away customers. As other reviewers have said, the online ordering system doesn't work. When several customers in line say they always order from the Central Ave. location and the computer says no, they indicated pickup in Glendale, the manager should acknowledge that there's a problem with the system. Payment was online. The manager refused to prepare the order without a second payment. The first rule of customer service is \"make it right.\" In addition to choosing Panera for individual orders, I frequently choose the caterer for business events. Panera, you are off the list forever, at all locations."}
{"text":"Panera would get a 5 from me if only the prices weren't so steep. The food is always good, service friendly, pastries on point, and interior clean and inviting. We went for a weekday lunch and the place was packed! Luckily there was a 2 top table just waiting for us to arrive. (Also wanted to add that it would be really nice if single people didn't think they were so special that they need a 4 top or booth all to themselves. People are so inconsiderate these days. Leave those table for larger groups!!) I tried the French onion soup for the first time as part of my Pick 2 lunch combo. It was good, better than I expected it to be. Not too salty, plenty of ooey gooey cheese and tasted croutons. I will most definitely get that again. My sandwich was my tried and true Chipotle Chicken Avocado melt, minus the peppers. My husband had the steak and white cheddar panini, no surprise there, and said it was super good. Another one we will definitely get again. Lots of steak in his sandwich and also a nice size for a man. I also added a $.99 pastry to my lunch, the caramel apple scone which I had not previously had. I ate it for breakfast the next morning. Wow. Winner! It was awesome. It had a caramelly apple flavor and little diced apples throughout it. Tender inside and a nice little crunch on the exterior. Perfect with my morning coffee."}
{"text":"Always fresh food. Very nice staff. We like breakfast to go from here at least once a week."}
{"text":"So I walk into The Panera Rest. On Ft Apache this morning to pick up a breakfast sandwich for my spouse. I inform the young lady behind if my request. She looks at her watch and informs me they are no longer serving breakfast sandwiches after 10:30. I look at my watch and it is 10:33. I was a little surprised, however, I understand there has to be some type of break off.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed and took my business to Starbuc"}
{"text":"We don't have Panera in Phoenix, so getting to eat at one is a treat.  I had a huge salad of walnuts, strawberries, blueberries and other fruits on a bed of romaine and it was fabulous!  It came with a big hunk of fresh bread too.

Simple and good.  I wish I could eat there more often."}
{"text":"Some of the worst wait time ever - 20 minutes deep in the drive through and still ten minutes out. 

Surely will have same quality food but this wait is BRUTAL!!"}
{"text":"This chain of bread and pastry products just came to Canada in October 2012 While their coffee isn't the best, the bread and pastry products are amazing in the quality and taste. And it seems almost all their food and drink items are of extremely high quality and taste, I had a plain cream cheese bagel there which I could spread as much or as little cream cheese as I wanted, and brought home a couple of cherry danishes for later home. For just a little more than the cost of Tim Hortons pastries and bagels, the taste at at least 10-20 times better. This is definitely my new go-to place for pastries and bagels. Even the smoothies, which I had one to claim as a gift on my Panera card I got when it initially opened, was probably the best smoothie I ever had.

My only complaints are the relative lack of seating because it's almost always nearly full, and the general closeness of the seats. Hope to see more locations soon, especially in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"If i could give no stars i would. As i walked in i noticed a big fly around the bread they have up front. As i kept watching the fly it landed on all the bread and just stood on top. So i seen a young guy that worked there, i told him about the fly situation, he looked at me like it was not a big deal and said ookkaayy and walked away. As i walked up to the cashier i just ended up grabbing a cookie that was wrapped up. And as i look over to the bread the fly was still there. So i brought it up to the lady and told her about it. She also just pushed the fly away and walked away. Lol disgusting they kept all the bread there to sell with fly shit. Never again will i get bread there.  Disappointment!!"}
{"text":"Service is not so great. I ordered a turkey apple cheddar sandwich and received a turkey avocado bacon. Not sure how they confused that but waitperson tried to correct the problem.  Staff seems confused, but when I finally got the right sandwich it was good."}
{"text":"Updated review. .this was some months ago now, was served raw chicken sandwich. Brought to their attention, wanted a refund.. first manager insisted it was cooked, walked away wouldn't deal with my objections. 2nd manager told me no food is actually made on property..it's all cooked elsewhere and only warmed there (interesting) so in that case they can not know for sure that it wasn't fully cooked. I left with receipt and food (,for photos,) and wrote to corporate. They sent back a pathetic generic letter telling me food is fine. Now, the best part is I ate there 4 to 5 times a week. That day, I had eaten breakfast there and gone back for lunch. And this is how they treat customers. Haven't been back since. I prefer kneaders now."}
{"text":"Dear Panera,  

I really wanted to like you...I remember years ago eating a cozy bowl of soup at another location in a place far away on a cold day.  When you opened so close to our house, I thought, this is a good option for that late Sunday night snack/dinner when I don't want to cook, and we could just have a quick healthy meal.  Well, we have tried twice now to like it, and my hope is waning.  First, the decor is not cosy by any stretch of the imagination.   I feel like I am eating in a airport cafeteria.  But I could overlook this.  I understand that this is not food cooked on the premises.  I can overlook that.  What I can't overlook is cold soup, chili and pasta.  Both trips.  Please,  is there some temperature regulation that you cannot make hot soup in order to avoid future litigation?  Literally, all our soup, and chili last night was tepid, while our Mac and cheese was downright cold.  And we dined in, this was not to go...Yes, we could have asked for someone to reheat, but I believe that if one of your main dishes is soup, it needs to be served hot the first time, and as this is a quick stop from home, it felt like too much effort.

It's not me, it's you.

Goodbye."}

{"text":"It's been a while since I've written a review and that's because most of the restaurants I've been to have been mediocre. I feel like my reviews should reflect a 1 star or 5 star to really help with the masses. Who cares about the 2, 3 or 4 star reviews. Those can range from the simple mom n pop's breakfast joint to the local fast food chain. Not worth writing or reading. But the 1 stars are a fun read and also a good piece of advice to avoid at all costs and the 5 stars are the gems you so happen to find which should be revered.

On with the review. Chain restaurants trying to be chic with the healthy options I think are a waste of time. They have the calories written beside each menu item. That's a great feature except the range is huge!!!! Which means you've come to the right place to try and make good healthy choices but you can also be a fatty. Very disconcerning. But the biggest issue I had (and will prevent me from coming back) is that they ran out of ingredients!!!! \"I'll have the steak and arugula sandwich. Whole, please.\"  \"Oh I'm sorry, we ran out of arugula.\" WTF!!! ARE YOU SERIOUS? It's the other half of the features in this sandwich?! How can you be out? Especially from a stupid chain restaurant? EPIC FAIL. Already disappointed at the counter and no reparations for their failures either. So I had the turkey, bacon blt sandwich. What another fail!

I never had the option to have my bread toasted which would have helped the structural integrity of this sandwich. (And yes, the bread has to hold up during the consumption of the sandwich or else the sandwich fails) and they gave me a pickle spear which was a nice touch but they placed it on the only napkin they provided. Making sure the pickle juice was completely soaked in the napkin I was going yo use to wipe my mouth. BIG EPIC FAIL!!!!

My girlfriend's soup came out kind of warm and turned I've cold after the 2nd spoonful and the bacon that came with our sandwiches were so paper thin you could literally read through it if put up against a glass window. All this for almost $30 bucks?? RIP OFF!

PANERA BREADS SHOULD SHUT DOWN ALL THEIR LOCATIONS AND STOP RIPPING PEOPLE OFF.

If you're ever here standing outside panera wondering to walk in or not, turn your head to the left and you'll see 5 GUYS BURGERS AND FRIES. Go there instead. You won't be disappointed.

On the plus side, one of the servers working here has a nice booty. Oh nvm, that booty belonged to my gf."}
{"text":"I do like Panera. I think that may be due to the fact that I only go there a 5-10 times a year. If I went more than once a month, I think it may have the ability to get old really quickly. They offer some nice sandwich and salad options, but there are usually only a couple that really are tasty. Bagels are great, but who can handle that carb load daily? Their coffee is okay. There's a lot of other places nearby that have better stuff. So my 4 stars is based on my 5-10 times a year average. Sometimes the service and food is a 3 and sometimes it's a 5."}
{"text":"This Panera is so busy and I can't understand why. The portions are pretty small and I feel that the prices keep going up and up. For lunch, you could easily pay around $14-15/per person now. If I'm going to pay that price for lunch, Panera is not at the top of my list. There are way better specialty local places in Madison to eat for that price. There's usually little to no seating available during lunch time. There's a bunch of people who use this location for meetings and work. One person will take up a whole table of four and will sit there for hours and hours sipping on the same drink they bought (they have free refills on soda, teas, cold coffee). The food is not that great either. Unless you like breads and carb loading. I have had salads that are very skimpy and not very fresh. The sandwiches are mostly bread and slim on meat and veggie ingredients. The soups are pretty salty. During a lunch, do not stop in for a quick to-go order. I have made that mistake a couple of times. One time, they lost my order and I waited about 35 minutes for my order. The other time, my order got stuck in the noon rush and I waited about 16 minutes for my order to emerge from the kitchen as I waited for my name to come up on their order screen. Neither time did they apologize for the wait."}
{"text":"I generally like Panera bread. Specially their pick 2 option. This time was the first time I tried their salad though. And it was terrible. I got some chicken lime salad with Avacado (can't remember the exact name) but was awful. Lettuce tasted old. The chicken was just partially shredded boiled pieces thrown in there. Felt sick afterwards. Won't try a salad again.  They are okay for soups and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great salads. Great soups. Great sandwich's. Bad service. Not gonna say the food is bad though. There is almost never anywhere to park or sit though. I really enjoy almost everything ive tried here and believe they could step up the customer service just a little."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out after the remodel. I ordered 1/2 soup 1/2 sandwich. The food was great! I loved that they used reusable dishes and had recycling bins! The real fruit teas were also super yummy. To make the experience even better, I ended up studying until a couple minutes after they had closed. The employees seemed completely unbothered by me staying late.

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always love my visits to Panera.  I always get the Turkey Bacon Cheddar panini, Broccoli soup, and their green tea.  Great selection of pasteries and desserts as well.  Get a \"my Panera\" card and earn rewards."}
{"text":"I'm not one to typically complain....but, WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!  We showed up for dinner at 8pm. They advertise new \"later hours\" till 10pm.  You would expect when over 1/2 of their menu is soup.....they would serve soup of all types to go with your Pick 2.

My friend and I  were selecting the Pick 2 option. We both wanted soup.  Each time we selected a soup we were told....\"we are out of that\"....or \"we might have enough for a small cup of that\". Then we were told that usually after 7pm they don't make anymore soup.  Well hell, this is 3 hours before closing.  I mean I can understand if I ran in at 9:45 and expected all soups to be available....but at 8pm?

 It baffles me how a business can advertise that it's open late till 10...and not keep the menu going at full capacity.  It's just as annoying as going through the drive-through at McDonald's on any given day and getting the predictable \"Shake Machine Down\" speech.  

What is even crazier is when you glance back at the kitchen at 8 pm and the floors have all been scrubbed like they are closing for the evening. Not a staff member to be seen other than the cashier.  I mean,  that's fine and all..... but don't be passing off bottom of the barrel stale soup to your guests.....especially at full retail price.  

I got so fed up trying to find a suitable alternative after having my taste buds geared up for something specific.....we just threw our hands up in the air and walked out in frustration.  

Tonight Panera lost 2 paying customers because everyone was ready to wrap it up and head home 2 hours early.

Yours truly, 
Disappointed

{"text":"-Costumer service is lacking at an all time high.
-food presentation was good and put together well.
-few customer had issues with their order and no one seemed to care to help
-the person making the food rolled their eyes at an old lady when she asked for a spoon for her soup 

While the customer service is poor and you can't expect service with a smile in this place my food was still good."}
{"text":"Very clean (must be new), and they have about 6-8 touch screens where you can place your order (probably helps when it's busy-I came early).

All the \"amenities\" you'd expect at a panera.  Other than that, not much else is different.

If you're lucky enough to have a woman named Shirley help you at the front counter, she's super nice-what a great way to start the day!"}
{"text":"I love Panera for their variety and lack of fried food. I'll admit it isn't the best soup, salad or sandwich I've ever had, but overall it's consistent and offers healthy options at all hours.

They are good about changing their menu seasonally and to test new options. Right now they are featuring a thai chopped salad.  While I prefer for the classics and steer clear of the calorie induced panini, I like that I can come and hour and a half before a lunch appointment and utilize their wifi to take care of important tasks.

{"text":"Last several orders placed online have been wrong. Wrong soup , no soup and no cookies etc...
Train your people quality control! They should have free meals for every screwup."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot because it is very convenient for where I work. Not many changes compared to the old version but the prices do seem to keep rising. It has gotten a little expensive for a soup and half sandwich or salad. The food is all good but nothing amazing. My daughter does love their bread bowls which she always gets when she joins me and the soups she said are really good. There are a lot of kiosks that they try to get you to use but I want to order with a real person so I ignore them and go up to the counter. I use computers but still feel like it would take me way to long on a kiosk and restaurants need to have customer service not kiosks. I go because it is convenient and decent but probably would not go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"This location is probably my least favorite. It is very noisy here all the time. The food is ok but not always great, kind of hit or miss. Service isn't bad but also not great like the signal butte location or val vista."}
{"text":"My favorite location! Service is always great, food is always good and fresh. It is usually pretty quiet and has a nice little outdoor area to eat which is great this time of year. My favorite is the crumbly blue cheese salad. The italian sandwich is also a favorite, it always has tons of meat. The restaurant always looks very clean and the cookies are usually fresh. The cream cheese brownies are heaven!"}
{"text":"Just got home from waiting forever in a short line at this Panera Bread drive through. I ordered a Modern Caprese sandwich and all that was on my sandwich when I got home was arugula and a little bit of melted cheese. Really disappointed especially since this isn't the first time I have had issues with my orders or slow customer service."}
{"text":"This panera sucked. I got a bread bowl with mac n cheese and a bagel to go, and to say the least a bagel toasted should not take longer than 5 minutes. Not only did I wait a very long time in the section where the so-called \"to go\" orders are, but the order was disappointing as ever. The bread bowl came empty (as expected) with mac and cheese on the side. Once i filled my bread bowl, I was let down by seeing my half full bowl. This was going to be my lunch but it turned out to be a mere snack. My bagel was equally as upsetting. It was an everything bagel, ordered to be toasted, and to go. They gave me the bagel on and plate instead of in a to go bag, which is just annoying when you're in a hurry. I spared them my fury and grabbed the bagel and left due to my time constrain. When I got around to eating the unappetizing bagel, my \"everything bagel\" was about as flavorful as a saltine cracker. It had a few poppyseeds and other toppings, but it tasted just like a plain bagel. I expected to much panera, I just want paradise bakery back."}
{"text":"Although I love the Mac & cheese at paradise bakery the experience was bad at this location.I went at 2:06 pm and it was not busy at all I placed an order to go, some cookies  and pick two. When they brought me the bag I opened n notice the Mac & cheese was not in it,I told cashier  and she said they must forgot to put it in the bag. When I got home which is about 20 min away and was going to eat the sand which. It was the wrong sand which. Normally I would just say it was due to the place being busy but this time that definitely was not the case. There was no excuse for missing the item or having the wrong sand which,most of the employees were just standing around and talking. The NAC & cheese was awesome though"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! I so wish there was a location in Utah. 

I got the chicken chipotle sandwich and Mac and cheese. Ohh that Mac and cheese was amazing so delicious  the people here were so nice, got our food quick. 

Seriously great food, good price, friendly people awesome location. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Panera bread is pretty much the Starbucks of the sandwich market. It appears to be a healthier alternative, but I'm not entirely sure it's true.

I've been here on separate occasions for breakfast and lunch. The sandwiches are pretty small for the price, and are simply too average tasting to warrant me coming back any time soon. The oatmeal was really bland and needs a ton of extra sugar to make it worthwhile. Not sure if its just me but I really hoped they had the option of using milk instead of water as it makes it taste so much better, but was disappointed to see it wasn't there. 

Anyway, Panera is definitely a meh, and doesn't really live up to its hype."}
{"text":"I liked the foodthe service was great and we got our food quicklyeven though it was busy on Sunday the water tasted great and was worth it!!!!I totally recommend this eatery and make sure you try the yummy water"}
{"text":"Food was good, seating could be better (party of five will have a tough time sitting together) and it's always crowded.  Order-taker was nice.  The fountain drink area needed attention (messy and lids out of stock).  Overall, I love the food, I just wish the place were bigger."}
{"text":"This place is great; crowded like all other Panera Breads in existence, but the food is fantastic...I love the chocolate croissants (called chocolate pastry or something); and the chicken salad sandwich and soups are great.  Anything from the bakery is a winner.  Staff here is way nicer than at the golden gate location."}
{"text":"Ordering was rough, took forever due to slow staff.  The kids Mac and cheese was 1/4 cup and was a rip off at almost six bucks.  The chicken salad and soup was good, and this location is very spacious, although you still have to contend with the wi-fi suckers that aren't buying anything.  Place was clean."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and you needed a magnifying glass to find the chicken in the Mediterranean wrap! The manager or regional manager who was there on that day was beyond rude and brash. Save your money this place has less to offer than a pre-wrapped sandwich at any gas station!"}
{"text":"After my best friend gave birth she really wanted panera. Pulled up tonight 20 minutes before close. Not only were they out of all soups but the man taking my order was very rude the whole time. 

If you're going to stay open till 10, be willing to offer a full menu till 10. If you're not going to be nice to customers until 10, don't work the closing shift. 

I also didn't get a cookie I ordered. They only get 2 stars because it's a location that stays open till 10. Thanks for that, but not really."}
{"text":"Salty Salty Salty Salty Salty Salty 

Had the Soba Noodle Broth Bowl and it was salty! 

Two stars because at least my Mango Smoothie was not salty. 

Across the street Whole Food's prepared section is way better for the same money."}
{"text":"I think that this Panera location is just OK.  I say this after being in newer, renovated PB's and seeing what the potential is.   Noting that many customers who come to Panera like to take advantage of the free wireless and do school work or work projects while drinking coffee, eating pastries / grub.  The older style Panera's are tight, claustrophobic booths where the newer ones have areas more suited for the above noted work including couches, cushioned chairs, widespread outlet locations, etc. etc.  This is the main reason for the docked rating.

The other noted con with Panera, IMO, is the prices for lunch and breakfast options in a time where competition is so high.  I usually brush this under the rug because of the quality of food, speed of service, healthy options, and the fact that its a much nicer place to relax and use free wi-fi then McD's.

Jalapeno and Cheddar bagel with sun dried tomato cream cheese is awesome and I really enjoy the soups here.  I've also tried the sandwiches with no complaints."}
{"text":"New Panera Bread location on Wilson Mills and 271S which provides all the necessities that any business professional or carb loving person could need.  Wife and I stopped in on Wednesday for an early morning snack.  I went with the Cheddar and Jalapeno breakfast sandwich which was tasty but thought that the cheddar and jalapeno slacked off a little in the bagel, but overall the sandwich was pretty tasty.   The wife went with a croissant the size as her head.  She said it was light, flaky, and tasted wonderful.  We also left with a loaf of sourdough which we used for sandwiches on Thursday.  Bread was wonderful, a bit chewy around the crust but that's exactly what I like in my sourdoughs. Overall, I was happy with our choice that early Wednesday morning.

This location is new so everything was spotless and not extremely packed, would have worked out great if I had my laptop and 2 hours to spare."}
{"text":"I  wish Panera would give you a cookie with the pick 2 instead of a piece of bread.  I ordered a salad and sandwich, I don't need more bread."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at a Panera before. But the service at this one is incredibly slow and many staff members are rude. We also ordered at a kiosk and then were told half the food we ordered was unavailable. After that we waited over twenty minutes for the food. And the order was still incomplete. I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"This Panera Bread recently took over the former Paradise Bakery location. The dining room was remodeled and looks very nice, clean, and modern. I really miss Paradise Bakery. The staff was awesome with Paradise, the staff at Panera is all young and very new you can tell. The person who well I guess assisted me was less than friendly and she did not even try to hide it. She did not even have the courtesy to say Hello, Good Afternoon or Welcome to Panera, how may I help you today. Her name was and Yes I am going to throw her under the bus ~~  \" Evelyn \" .... She first needs go to customer service training or something. Evelyn is just rude, grouchy and does not even smile, well at least not to me. I had to keep asking her \" Excuse me what was that, I did not hear you my dear? \" I just felt like she did not either like her job or just born rude. The food was good. But the service was lousy. The dude who called out my name called out the wrong name. My name is sooo easy and he jacked up my name and did not even apologize for it. I had to confirm the order then tell him my name and how to say it correctly. I said this loud enough for my voice to travel and I didn't care cuz first Evelyn the grouch then this dumb kid who cant say a simple name right. Panera Bread Avondale I hope that you are listening. I will think twice before I personally come back . Evelyn I will remember you and rather have someone else unless you change your attitude."}
{"text":"This location is really nice. Posted up in a growing area of Gilbert I am sure it will continue to take off and be busier and busier as developments continue to go in around it. It is quite the fancy and posh Panera to go to. 

Once inside, you will find a row of self order kiosks to order from or you can bypass them and head to the counter to meet with an employee to place your order and check out the menu. There are tons of ordering options so you can even just go right to a table, open the phone app, and place your order to your table to avoid the lines. 

After ordering it was only a short amount of time before our food arrived. It was good as expected but it was pretty pricey for the product. I have felt that way about Panera for quite some time... but I guess it hasn't stopped me from visiting every now and again. 

Because of how automated the place is you don't really have much interaction with the staff. The place was pretty clean and there were plenty of areas to sit and types of seating (tables, booths, high tops, etc.)"}
{"text":"Absolute worst customer service ever at this location! Employees could care less about you or getting your order correct. I've tried several times to eat here but every time my food has been slapped together like it came out of a school cafeteria and every time I ask for no onion I get them anyway. I order a grilled ham and cheese with just ham and cheese, I get tomato with onion some nasty burnt cheese and something that kinda resembles ham but I can't be sure. This is a brand new location and it's very disappointing that it's so bad!!!"}
{"text":"Good selection of all the sandwiches, salad, drinks and bakery. The staffs are very nice and friendly here. Only thing that I don't really like is their music. Last time I visited was trying to do some work with my laptop. Sitting there about almost 2 hours and they have only 2-3 songs kept playing over and over again which drives me crazy. I ended up using a headset and play some music on my cellphone."}
{"text":"Going to keep this review short and sweet. My last visit I ordered a Thai salad to go. Got home and within the first few bites found not one, not two, but multiple bugs floating in my salad. I wrote an email complaint to corporate and got a response 4 days later from a manager saying she can't help me because this isn't her store. Really lady??

Soup is always Luke warm or cold. Never hot. Your bill will be about $15-20 for one person and nearly $30 for two. It's not worth the price, hassle, or wait times. 

Keep your money and go elsewhere. Let's put this Panera out of business. I will never return!!"}
{"text":"Best visit today ... Service with a smile from Alexis ... got u-pick-2 & I had to go back to add a pastry for 99cents ... & had to back again for coffeeee .."}
{"text":"Pecan roll looks a bit smaller today... & maybe it's just me but kitchen service seemed slower considering I see a lot of server"}
{"text":"I have been going to Panera for bout 10yrs nw ... Today I ordered one of their U-pick 2 items . Pick a sandwich which was half the sz of what they used to give u before, supposed to be half a sandwich as u pair it with maybe a salad or soup   ... This time I ordered soup which now comes in a smaller bowl which is about a sz of a cup ... The small sandwich was priced @ $4.99 & cup of soup @ $3.79 ... & a medium sz drink + tax = 12.79
I have ordered u pick 2 bout 2 wks ago with salad & serving was also smaller ... Still good taste but not reasonably priced as servings Hv changed to be smaller 
Their new soba bowls are also pricey for the Amt of serving"}
{"text":"Ordered cranberry chicken flatbread first they got my order wrong with a different sandwich then I got the right sandwich with only one slice of chicken as big as my pinky and literally half a teaspoon of cranberries wtf? Even after I complained no one apologized or fixed my order."}
{"text":"I've only been to Panera Bread once before since there aren't any in my area both at home nor where I go to school, but the last time I had Panera Bread, I enjoyed it so when I saw that the plaza my family and I stopped at to have lunch on our way home from our vacation had a Panera Bread, I immediately suggested that we go there.

The experience I had at this particular Panera Bread was really great. I loved my Fuji Chicken Salad. I'm usually very particular about my meat, but I loved the chicken in my salad. I also loved how they put apple chips in the salad as well. Also, even though I love cheese, I sometimes find feta a little overpowering, but in this case they didn't add too much and it worked really well with everything else in the salad. I also tried some of my sister's macaroni and cheese, which I liked as well.

I was very impressed by the service we got. The people behind the registers and our servers were all very friendly. The manager also came and checked up on us as we were finishing up our meal and offered to take our plates for us!

It's a pity I don't live closer to any Panera Bread locations... Otherwise, I'd be going a lot more!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to pick up a quick lunch before I headed to work. They got my order wrong, I got home and had a completely different salad than what I ordered. One I would never eat, and even if I wanted too the cucumbers on it looked they'd been sitting out all day long. I called back and I was offered to come back in for a new salad however, I live too far away and had to be to work. So she said they'd give me something free next time I came in, but a refund or a whole new meal next time would have been more appropriate since they messed up and I'm stuck with a salad that's just going in the trash. I don't know if I'll go back."}
{"text":"The drive-thru needs help to say the least. Waiting for order taker and waiting at the window for your food takes forever. I wouldn't suggest the drive-thru even if you're short on time. If you're short on time, just do the Rapid Pick-up, and your food will be ready - no lines or a century spent waiting. Otherwise, a trip inside when you have more time is ideal."}
{"text":"Self-serve lemonade? I AM SOLD! 

MAC AND CHEESE
This is the usual for Kate B! Few cons though, if you're hungry get the large mac and cheese. The regular/small mac and cheese is the same as the kids mac and cheese and cheaper! So just get the kids if you're not that hungry! 

CHERRY PASTRY
Instead of bread or apple I get this instead, I don't really like cherries but this one passed my standards lol?

SERVICE
They messed up my order one time and the receipt says that if they do you get a free stuff! And it is 100% true, I got a free scone! They seem to clean the table as soon as the customers leave, and it looks like they added more seats.
Like I said above self-serve lemonade is a win win if you LOVE drinking arnold palmer!!!!!

So far this is the only Panera that I like and wont mind to be in for hours."}
{"text":"i ordered for delivery, it was incomplete. The poor driver felt horrible. i was a bit upset after 30 minutes had passed & the driver had not come back. I called the store & they said he had already left to come back with the rest. When the driver got back, they had given me extra desserts for the inconvenience. I was not expecting that at all, i had not even been rude or complained when i had called. All i had asked is if the driver was actually coming back? haha i was waiting so i can jump in the shower. I thought it was a great gesture & was happy to know that they cared without being told to!"}
{"text":"Nice on the inside, and full of comfortable couches.  When my friends and I went, they were out of soup, so we wound up just sitting in their seats for 20mins while waiting for burgatory.  I just wish they wouldve has that soup."}
{"text":"Panera is always a solid choice for somewhere to go and grab a quick bite, especially if you are caring about what you put in your stomach.  I got a delicious salad with chicken in it, and it was top notch.  I am happy to pay $8 for a salad as long as it is as delicious as what Panera puts out."}
{"text":"I park outside on the street of Panera so I could run in and grab a bite to eat.  Well, I didn't have quarters, and when I asked the girl at the counter if I could exchange my dollar for 4 quarters so I could feed the meter while I ate, she looked at me like I was crazy and said \"I can't give you change.\"  ..... How the hell am I supposed to park and eat if I do not have change and you are unwilling to exchange a dollar for me.  I know it might be company policy to not open the register, but do not roll your eyes at me and get an attitude.  Gracias para nada."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious, and the atmosphere and area is fantastic.  It is in a beautiful little strip mall across from the new Village at Pine center.  Not to mention the staff was so nice.  A group of us came in to eat and work on a project, and they let us go into the back business/private room to work.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Very happy with this location. Actually I've never been disappointed at any Panera. I love their new loyalty program and seasonal smoothies. I do wish that they would have the black bean soup more often, it's my favorite healthy fast food treat!"}
{"text":"I stopped here as an out of towner for a late Saturday lunch.  The bakery case looked over the top gorgeous.  I pulled myself away from the case and ordered a bowl of soup.  The counter person suggested doing the soup and  half a sandwich option. Perfect!   I enjoyed the lemon chicken with orzo soup and terrific ham and swiss on light rye half  sandwich."}
{"text":"Don't go to this panera bread they clearly don't care about their customers because I just wasted my money!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was okay-Half way into our meal an employee seemed to be tired and/or having a bad day. He proceeded to sit in the front of the dining area. Plumbers butt, in his 100% Clean food dirty shirt and head down on the table."}
{"text":"This is a nice new addition to the Bakery Square complex.  I particularly like having an option for coffee and breakfast in the morning when I stay at the Springhill.  Sometimes powedered scrambled eggs from the buffet just don't seem all that appetizing.  And I won't even bring up the coffee.

Last time I was in, I tried the cranberry walnut bagel - whoa, it was good.  Almost too good.  I found myself craving it every morning before heading into the office!

My visits to this location have been as expected and on par with other locations.  There were a couple of issues I witnessed right after they first opened, where the cooks weren't sure what went on some of the breakfast sandwiches, but those details seem to have been ironed out.  The space is a little small, and is a bit oddly set up, but it seems to work.  I can imagine though that if it gets really crowded, trying to get back to the pick up counter would be challenging.

All in all, a great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Good food, and friendly efficient staff. Wish it had a drive through but then I would probably go too often."}
{"text":"Worst Panera ever! Order at the drive through always took forever and was usually wrong. Dining room is dirty. The restaurant is all but empty and every table is covered with crumbs and dirty napkins. Once I asked them to remake my daughter's ridiculously over burned grilled cheese and they said that's the only way they could make it. Um, ok.... I've given up on Panera unless I'm in Lakewood, that location is great."}
{"text":"I think that the food is a tad pricey for what you get. I do like the brocolli cheddar potato soup combined."}
{"text":"Drive through is ok if you have a simple order but  dunning inside is a nightmare. Poor service, not clean, and not pleasant. Will never done inside again."}
{"text":"Kat was amazing and so helpful! I needed some cookies as a gift and Kat made awesome recommendations taste-wise and price-wise. She went above and beyond! Thanks, Kat"}
{"text":"Has really gone downhill since changing from Paradise. No longer give cookie with meal or even bake the cookies I used to love (lemon or chocolate chip coconut)! So sad!"}
{"text":"Love the food at Panera, it is always good and fresh. Typically I usually only have a gable and coffee, today I tried one of the breakfast sandwiches, and really enjoyed it.

This location seems to be embracing a lot of new technology. There is a \"quick order kiosk\" right as you walk in, that utilizes some iPads to allow you to place your order so you don't have to wait in line at the counter. They also had a number on each table and you could order online and have it bought right to you table."}
{"text":"@panerabread sucks. Matthews NC location \"ran out of flatbread.\" Cashier was very polite, though. Seems something that might happen to a bush league manager, given that they are in the middle of a national flatbread campaign. Went elsewhere. One star for cashier courtesy, zero stars for stupidity."}
{"text":"Clean and comfortable and modern.  I like it!  I ate a Roasted Turkey Cranberry Flatbread.   Oh boy I loved it and the bag of potato chips.  When somplace does it just right I like to say so!"}
{"text":"I normally come for their hazelnut coffee, which is good and fresh when not watered down. Hot beverages 4.5/5

Today I decided to eat in and chose the pick 2 combo; flatbread and salad. I went with the bbq chicken and beets and quinoa kale salad thinking it would be good. The flatbread serving was pathetic, offering only a slice of chicken and sparse ingredients in the middle of a very bare pita with a side of more plain baguette. The picture on their website looks nothing like actuality! The salad was decent, though would have scored better if it contained more beets and quinoa as implied. Food 2.5/5

Freshness of pastries vary depending on location and service is usually fairly decent. 3/5"}
{"text":"A couple of coupons arrived in the mail, and that was all she wrote. They replaced a Paradise Bakery that was in this same spot. This spot is close to home, so convenience is a bonus. 

They have the ordering kiosks here, which are easy to use and quite convenient. Order on the touch screen pad, grab your drink, and watch for your name to move to the \"Ready\" column on the digital board. 

When they first opened, those who ordered via the kiosks received a free cookie with meals, but that seems to have been an introductory thing. 

Tip: Parking around lunchtime is a bit tough...you may have to park in the back 40!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place if I want to grab a bite, do some work on my computer, and don't feel like going to a coffee shop. I usually order through the self-serve stations - it's so quick, easy, and I have all the time in the world to look through the menus on some days when I just can't seem to decide what I want! I switch it up between a sandwich, panini, or the soups. I feel that the food here has been consistent with other Panera locations, so I don't have complains there. Just your standard Panera Bread.

I like the variety of seating in here. There are also outlets accessible enough for when I bring laptop. The staff here are GREAT. Always so friendly, helpful, and really try to keep the place maintained and cleaned even when it's not busy. 

Parking has never been a problem for me. There are spots in front and on the right side of the front entrance."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. I am sad to write this review because I have been a fan of Panera in the past, but after this experience we won't be back. This location has gone downhill rapidly; the restaurant is not as clean as it used to be, the staff isn't friendly, and the food is no longer edible...at least it wasn't tonight. 

We had been craving soup and were excited to get a group portion of broccoli cheese along with a soba noodle bowl and a blt sandwich. The woman who took our order wasn't exactly unfriendly, but she was not warm and welcoming either. We ordered our food to go and it was ready in just about 3 minutes. Now I'm all for quick to go orders, but this was too quick. When we got it home we divided it all up and then immediately noticed that the turkey in the blt (yes there is turkey in the blt ?!?) had spoiled. It tasted horrendous and we had to throw out the entire sandwich...so gross. The soup was not very good and did not meet our soup craving at all. Unfortunately we will have to find someplace else for soup and sandwiches. 

I suggest going elsewhere if you want your food to taste good and not be spoiled."}
{"text":"Came here for a blt sandwich. Went through the drive through made my order and pulled up to the window. After I paid I waited about 10 minutes for my food. Once I got home and opened up my bag and started to eat I realized I was given stale bread. I could barely bite into the sandwich! I was really craving a blt and hoped this could be my go to spot for them unfortunately I will probably never go back. What kind of person makes a sandwich with stale bread? Very very disappointed:/"}
{"text":"It hurts me to write a bad review for panera because its my go to restaurant and my favorite of all time but this one in particular made a horrible impression on me. The cashier was nice but the people \"fixing\" the drink machine were my problem. It took three people to put together the green tea fountain and on top of that it took twenty minutes to put together. Thy blocked the entire fountain and didn't bother moving out of other peoples way when they needed a refill. Not to mention the tea for the first time ever was horrible. But that's not the part that set me off. One of the workers was talking to me like I didn't speak English and took my buzzer out of my hand and put it on my table. When I moved it, she told me that it was in the wrong place and told me to put it next to the table number so the people bringing the food out can see it... Um, I've been to plenty panera locations and this is by far the only and worst experience I've ever had. Hopefully it'll be the last."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery looked better. The new set up looks very cluttered and there are too many walls. Had a breakfast  chiabata  sandwich. I hated the egg in it. Not real, not tasty."}
{"text":"Being a remote location turned out to be great for this eatery. Always enough parking and the place is never too busy. Service is quick and flexible, i.e.  you can ask for something that's not on the menu and night get lucky! (In my case it was a decaf latte) - and yes, I can see that this will raise a lot of your eyebrows. :-) All in all, one of the cleanest and quietest Panera places I've been to."}
{"text":"Good: 

Food is good, lattes and coffees are very not bad. Ample parking. Has a nice patio area. 

Bad: 

Has a tendency to get crowded sometimes, menu is confusing, hot items are only warm at best, somewhat expensive. 

Side observation: 

on my previous visits here service was mediocre at best - not even a hint of smile or desire to be helpful from the employees. But on my last visit everything changed completely: the cashier smiled a lot and was very helpful and nice and one of the servers came over and cleaned our table once we were done with our food.

In essence, this place is clearly not perfect, however it's nice to see them improving and hopefully they won't stop there."}
{"text":"Very friendly and accommodating service. Yummy food. Free cookie for ordering at kiosk. Clean and laid back inside."}
{"text":"One star because we got food. But the employees are uninviting and not sure of the menu, huge turn off. $6 for a kids meal and the girl didn't know if it came with a drink, then said it'll be something like a dollar or 2 more to add one. Then when we got the kids meal, they didn't put a cookie in the bag. When I asked about the cookie at the register the girl asked if I paid for a cookie. I said \"well it says on the menu that it comes with one.\" After she stared at me for a few seconds, she slowly walked over to get a cookie, still very unsure if she was doing the right thing. Never visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Absolute worst location in the Cleveland area. Every time I have the occasion to pick up food here there are lots of employees working but no one seems to care to work. The wait is incessantly long but for no reason."}
{"text":"We had lunch here today and ordered BBQ Chicken Salad. Also the corn chowder soup. The food was great. Even better, the order was filled correctly which is something most restaurants have issues with. We will be back just because I know this now."}
{"text":"Dealing with chain restaurants or fast food joints can be a trying experience, but I love this Panera Bread location.

I work a mile away and I go to lunch here at least twice a week. The consistent quality of food and customer experience is what keeps bringing me back. 

Sure, sometimes they're back up, but there are a lot of people in the area that come here for lunch. If you're chowing anywhere from 12 to 1:30, I strongly suggest ordering online for pickup or to just have them make the food ahead of time, otherwise you'll be in for a wait."}
{"text":"I came to this location just to get a giftcard for $50.00. Thankfully I made that choice because I received super friendly service with a genuine smile at this location. It was such a difference from my experiences at Panera from when I lived in the Bay Area of California .

When I walked in there was a bit of a line but they had the gift cards right at the front of the location so it was easy to grab what I needed and I was able to stand in line.

I was quickly helped by Shoshonee. Not only was he happy to help me he also let me know about a promo where I got a five dollar giftcard for every twenty five I spent . He had to find a manager which took some time but he was apologetic and completely making sure I felt like he valued my time .

Overall this Panera is one I plan to return to again and again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there a couple of week ago for lunch. We got there about 1:30. Ordered our food then tried to find a clean place to sit! All tables were dirty, food and stuff on the tables.  So I wiped off a table and went to get our sodas.  Diet  Pepsi  was out, the beverage station was terrible, dirty, the floor was sticky, went to get a cover for our sodas and the container that held the lids was so dirty that we passed on the lids.  The vinyl seat where we sat was torn and nasty.  I went to wash my hands after trying to clean the table and the bathroom was disgusting, even after washing my hands They still felt dirty.  I can see a bathroom in a gas stations looking this bad but not in. A Place that Serves Food! The floor was so nasty I came home and cleaned the soles of my shoes off! There were at least 12 tables that needed immediate attention yet  a couple of employees walked around and didn't touch them. I can't imaging that this place could ever pass a health or sanitation inspection.  Our food was served and we could only drink our sodas and eat the chips that were in a bag, didn't trust if the kitchen was clean after looking at the rest of the facility.  This place used to be amazing.  E mailed the facility, and was told Thank You for your concerns we will share it with our workers!  SERIOUSLY?  From the other reviews this seems to be an o going problem! Is it to much to expect that when I spend $25.00  for lunch That  I could actually eat it in a clean we'll cared for place? My advice is save your money, go to another establishment that is clean, appreciates it customers and takes pride in their business."}
{"text":"Stopped into Panera Friday afternoon 12.23.16 for hot soup to warm the body on a cold Vegas day. 

Initially ordered the Broccoli Cheddar Bowl for 5.99 until the cashier recommended ordering each item separately for larger portion size. Needless to say 11 bucks later I had to choose a side item and was offered a pastry for an additional buck. 

The soup was great but it chills pretty quickly in the bread bowl. Next time I'll order the soup by itself!"}
{"text":"This Panera is hit or miss. I usually end up getting ignored by the younger employees that work there. I even had one once tell me, \"I was supposed to be gone 15 minutes ago.\" I just looked at her and said, \"So are you taking my order or not?\" Another time I tried to pay with a gift card and the girl told me, \"Our credit cards aren't working.\" And I said, \"Ok well this is a gift card.\" And she said, \"But we are having problems with our credit cards.\" And I said, \"Ok well I have a gift card and my debit card.\" And she asked for my debit card and used it without a problem. They never ask for your My Panera card. But then again I once had a lady give a balloon to the little girl I nanny. And there are some people there who are super nice and make really good coffee. So like I said hit or miss."}
{"text":"This is a go to place for my wife and I to grab lunch.  Usually we go to the one on Sunset but I think they are all the same.  For a great price, $6.99, you can get the 'Pick Two'.  Choice of a 1/2 sandwich, salad, or soup.  Mix and match however you see fit.  The sandwiches and salads are great but a favorite of mine is the French Onion Soup with the home made croutons.  For a quick, cheap lunch, this is a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Ugh - no.

I don't expect that Panera in an airport will be anything like Panera in the real world and in fact, it wasn't. Here's what you can expect if you choose to patronize one of the only options in the C11-19 gates. 

Pastries that manage to be both stale and gummy. That takes talent. 

Rude AF workers - I had the nerve to ask for ice for my ICED tea. Along with a delightful eye roll, the worker handed me the tiniest cup on earth - you know those \"free water\" cups? That. She may as well have thrown it me for all the hostility on display. 

It's a no for me. Eat elsewhere or wait until you arrive."}
{"text":"While the food tastes fresh and healthy, I can't help feeling that Panera Bread is a bit overpriced. I ordered the Pick Two option with a half sized Watermelon Feta Salad and a half sized Roasted Turkey & Caramelized Kale Panini. Each item was a little under $6 each. You would think you would save money because that sounded like a combo, but I think it's more expensive ordering this way. Next time, I'll order one complete entree.

The Watermelon Feta Salad was okay. It was nice and refreshing, but it didn't make my taste buds go crazy or anything like that. The Roasted Turkey & Caramelized Kale Panini is delish. It was my second time ordering it and it didn't disappoint in taste, but the size however did get to me. I know it's a half order, but you can't help but compare what else you could have gotten for 6 bucks. A whole foot long sub from Subway? Or this itty bitty 4 bite-er panini. I know the quality of ingredients is there at Panera, but Subway isn't exactly junk food either.

The last thing I have to say is, I also ordered the Iced Green Tea and while the flavor wasn't bad, it didn't resemble green tea to me. Overall, I like this place. I just wouldn't eat here all the time because I feel you can get more for your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am leaving another review as this is the first time I have actually sat and had lunch here. My previous review was based on a take out experience where I bought some bagels. 

I came here on a Thursday around 1130. It is extremely busy and tough to get a table so if you come at noon, you should plan for take out or standing for a while. The way that it works is you order your food at the counter and then they give you a number to take with you while you find yourself a table. They will bring your food to you. Water and drinks are at the back (serve yourself)

The service is friendly and the food came quickly but I would give the food a 2. I ordered the quinoa, lentil, kale broth bowl but it was very salty. I loved the idea of it and it could have been so great. My dad had the French onion soup and a half chipotle chicken sandwich and both were very salty. Total cost was $22.98 for the 3 items. 

I think I have decided that I would only return for the bagels. That being said, I came here a few weeks ago to pick up some bagels and they had completely run out which was very disappointing after driving all the way there. 

Sorry Panera. Great people but the food could be better."}
{"text":"Food is always good/consistent. Service is the slowest of any location I have ever attended. They have no motivation you can tell."}
{"text":"Panera has a range of food options from soup to salad to sandwiches. You can order from the automated kiosk, pay, and receive your food without waiting for a cashier.  It's a big plus if you know what you want. Would give five stars if ordering system let you see calorie value of your meal and integrated with apps like FitBit to track nutritional information."}
{"text":"Great Iced Green Tea & soups! The booths make a great place to work with free WiFi!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Our sandwiches were excellent. And so were the bakery items. And the WiFi was reliable (not always true of places that advertise free WiFi). An excellent experience."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed with Panera. They always leave outstanding service and excellent food. Never have I ever been greeted with such grace til today. I was sitting outside with my friend eating until a worker came out and asked if I wanted a refill. I was so thirsty for Mountain Dew no it's like Sharon came to my rescue to revive my thirst. Thank u Sharon for refilling my drink I love coming to this location so much more now because of you."}
{"text":"Food was standard Panera but the staff was not. We could not site outside because every table was full of dirty dishes that were not touched by any staff during the length of our entire visit. Inside was fine except for the bathroom experience. My wife says there were no paper towels in the women's bathroom; she had to walk out of the women's bathroom to ask a staff member for some (with dripping wet hands), and it took a full 10 minutes and asking four different staff members where they were. Finally someone had to get a ladder out and get them off some top shelf, and then they just handed them to my wife as if it was her job to put them in the bathroom. So how long did this go unnoticed? How many employees didn't wash their hands that day after using the bathroom? Then later I used the bathroom and found the no-touch dispenser inoperable with a roll of paper towels placed nicely on the counter forcing everyone to pick it up to ensure maximum germs were being shared among the patrons. Lastly, we used the new kiosks, but there was no one helping so didn't understand when you do it that way you have to get EVERYTHING yourself including cups. The staff here has apparently checked out of doing their jobs outside of standing behind the counter. We will not go here again."}
{"text":"If you enjoy this spot why not join the deals.?   You everyone should join IT cause I like the free things."}
{"text":"The most frustrating unnecessary experience... I don't know if it's because they potentially have new staff but somehow the idiot at the register managed to mess up the simplest order: an asiago bagel with plain cream cheese. Most Panera's give you a buzzer when your order is ready or the staff will come out and deliver it to your table. However, my bagel was stacked on top of other customers bagels waiting at the counter... Once I finally obtain my bagel I see there is no cream cheese. I go up to the counter to ask for cream cheese and the idiot who rang us up said \"we're all out\". I then tell my sister (who's order was fine) and she goes up there to ask for a cream cheese and the idiot again says \"well you guys can share it, I only use about half but if you want another one I need to see your receipt\"... at this point my sister is heated because the idiot at the register is beyond familiar with us and she managed to not even give us a receipt so how are we to show her what we ordered... At this point my mom gets involved and asks to speak to the manager about this f**king plain cream cheese fiasco lol. The manager says \"we didn't run out of plain cream cheese\" so the idiot at the register is well... a f**king idiot (who woulda guessed). 

Anyways I got my cream cheese but at this point I was like f*ck it, shoulda went to Starbucks or somewhere else... overall these people need to get their shit together whether it's communicating better with staff AND customers or properly training staff before putting them on the most difficult job ever of being a cashier... smh. Good luck to those who enter these doors of mass chaos. I'll pray for ya!"}
{"text":"Ordered salad to go, I guess I should have checked my order.  Returned to office and had a dry salad no dressing.  Called Panera the young lady offered to credit my order or I could return for the dressing. Of course I wasn't going to travel back so I chose the credit.  She proceed to place me on hold for 3 mins then another lady answered and said she was the manager and I couldn't have a credit but a free pastry on my next visit.  I replied this location is not convenient as I was visiting this area.  She insisted if I ever traveled back I could receive a meal.  I explain that was highly unlikely but she was not serviced friendly. Just have a nice day. 
Horrible this Dry salad is not worth $10.00."}
{"text":"This Panera used to be on the end of the strip mall and now it is it's own standing location with a drive through. Since then, it seems like the lemonades and iced teas have been watered down, salads aren't the freshest and soups have no flavor.

If the food hasn't changed, the atmosphere definitely has. This new layout has me feeling like I am in a cross between a Denny's and a McDonalds. Gone is the open layout, the seating is hidden behind walls now. To get to the drink station, you have to walk past the food window."}
{"text":"So... my wife has been enjoying Panera Bread for years, especially where we previously lived in Orange County California. 

Now retired in Arizona, I stopped by the local Chandler location and picked up a couple salads a week ago. All was good. So I loaded the Panera App and used it to order three Thai Chicken Salads. I was at the restaurant within 5 minutes of ordering and asked a server if the dressing comes \"on the side\" to which he replied \"always.\" I then got my order and refrigerated it when I got home. When we sat down to eat, we discovered gooey peanut sauce all over each salad, plus... they forgot to put chicken in any of the three salads! I immediately called and spoke to Manager Regina, who was great. She offered to either remake the salads or refund to my Apple account. I didn't want to make the drive back, so I opted to get a refund which was confirmed by an email. \"Rapid Pickup\" at Panera is a great setup, but only as good as the person putting the food together. We may try Panera again, but not for pickup. We ate leftovers tonight... what a bummer."}
{"text":"Thank you! Finally a restaurant chain committed to \"clean\" ingredients that you can feel good about eating. I was delighted when Panera came to the Phoenix metro area.

One of my favorites are their Corn Chowder (seasonal in summer) and the Southwest Chile Lime Salad (photo). The chicken is pulled and put on the salad and has such flavor! Because it's real and not some pressed breast with fake grill marks on it! Recently tried the Mac 'n Cheese made with pasta shells. Homemade baguette comes with your order of soup or side dish. Great comfort food!

Sandwiches are pressed on a panini grill if you'ld like it hot. Their breakfast sandwiches are made with real eggs that you can order scrambled or over easy."}
{"text":"I stayed in the hotel above, so this place was a convenient breakfast each morning. Good service every morning, efficient if not overly friendly. Food was always fresh and quick. Coffee and related add-ins never empty or stale. Clean dining area, ample parking."}
{"text":"Food came out promptly but my food was cold. I also ordered an iced mocha with no whipped cream and was given a drink that seems like plain iced coffee with no trace of mocha anywhere. No sipped mocha does not mean iced offee"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Placed online delivery order for 12 people and they showed up 30 mins late! Only explanation given by manager was out delivery service left at 5:15 when I needed the order to be delivered by 5:15!"}
{"text":"They have attitudes beyond belief, they opened at 7but when i came in at 8 they didn't have any soup ready. i stood at the cash register for 3 minutes before the lady topped talking to another worker and actually took my order, i was never greeted. ordered to go and opened my bag four hours later to the salad only have filled and no extra croutons like i paid for. wont be back."}
{"text":"Quick breakfast with Coffee Latte, Tea and Sandwich. Nothing special but OK. Sandwich was tasty and hot as expected. We will stay for some days in Toronto and use this location for daily breakfast."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong in a Panera Bread, but I thought the service was outstanding.  Friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"How can they pack so many calories into such tiny sandwiches?

God, I love bread."}
{"text":"They can't get their take out orders right if their life depended on it. 3 our of 4 recent orders were wrong. These people give hospitality bad name. I know that I will never again bring my money to this store"}
{"text":"Don't order for delivery from this location. It took two hours to get my food. The salad was warm and my smoothie was just juice at that point. Get a manager who knows how to hire dependable drivers. I would expect if you don't have enough drivers for the manager to get off their ass and deliver it themselves. The driver was a great guy, obviously putting up with a ton of shit due to all the orders being late."}
{"text":"Every time I order from there the order is wrong.  This morning, not only was our bacon NOT crispy as requested, there was no bacon. Toast was not wheat as requested but white.  When I called to complain, the manager, Kathy, basically told me she'd talk to the girl that took the order and was very dismissive.  She told me \"if you knew the morning I'm having\" and when I said that wasn't very helpful to my particular issue, she hung up on me.  Wow - worst customer service I've had anywhere lately!"}
{"text":"Vegetarians beware! I went for a carryout meal after a long, late day at work. Told the cashier I've had problems in the past when I ordered salads with NO chicken, only to find tiny pieces of chicken throughout my salad -- clearly the chicken had been picked out as an afterthought.  She assured me that they make each of their salads fresh, and no chicken would be put on my salad. Stupid me, I believed her and didn't check the order before leaving -- fatigue and hunger were compromising my judgment. There was a big pile of fresh chicken on my salad when I sat down to eat. At that point I'm not about to call or return to the restaurant. I removed the chicken, piece by piece, trying to find the mini shreds that aren't so easy to see. Picture the scene in Little Miss Sunshine when the grandfather went on a diatribe about another chicken dinner. That's how I felt when I saw chicken on my salad. Sigh. 

Although this is my first visit to the University Ave location, I've had this happen numerous times at the one on West Washington and Regent. I keep telling myself I'm not going back but then several months pass and I decide to give it another shot. Don't do it. The bakery and bread are good and the rating probably deserves another star or two (if you're a meat eater!) but I'm totally fed up with the repeated bad experiences."}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm done with this location.  (Read my previous review.). I was able to contact Panera Corporate and they supplied me with a $10 gift card to replace the incorrect sandwich.

Well guess what?  I went there today and had the SAME EXACT ISSUE!

Learn to make food correctly.  I even called the manager to find out what goes on the sandwich.  They didn't know.  Management should know their menu or at least offer to put me on hold to find out.

I'm not going to request a refund because I'm going to feed the tuna salad to my cat."}
{"text":"Not too bad for a quick stop while on the road. It not the cleanest Panera I've seen  but they are fast."}
{"text":"I don't often go to panera bread ... After all, the name pretty much says, hey Amanda, come here for some gluten and die. Awesome! 
However, since it is right beside the running room, I've occasionally popped in for a smoothie or coffee post-run. Yesterday I went in and had the green power smoothie. And O.M.G. 
Seriously. 
It has no dairy which is nice for me. Mango and peach purée with spinach and ice. I think that's it. You don't taste the spinach but it makes it a nice bright green colour. The mango and peach are divine!! I am a sloowwww drinker but I finished this within 20 minutes (whereas normally a smoothie takes me a good two hours and is melted by the end). The service was good but a little slow considering what I ordered. The girl making the smoothies was moving like molasses so the cashier that took my order actually popped in and made the drink. The place itself is nice and clean and all of the foods are displayed quite nicely. Maybe one day they'll have food I can eat. Until then, green smoothies I shall have! And lots of them!!"}
{"text":"Good clean food.  The food isn't like amazing, but it's very healthy-ish (at least what I ordered) and good prices.  Staff was friendly.

Iced tea cooler was empty when I tried to get some and it was still empty 15 minutes later--they should pay attention to everything.  Other than that, nice place to grab a quick bite and a good place to set up shop and study--looks like some people were doing that here.

Loyalty program in place for Panera is terrible.  They reward you randomly when you make a visit and they swipe the loyalty card.  It's supposed to be fun, which I guess it can be, but it's not a good advertising tool.  You don't know what you're going to get or when you're going to get it. For example, my friend only buys sandwiches there and she got \"rewarded\" with a free pastry or what-have-you.  Utterly useless.  No way of really tracking anything so it wouldn't necessarily induce me to go again as a default spot.

dmo out"}
{"text":"Crapola all teenagers screwed my order up it was a bread bowl. The soup goes in the bowl."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, consistent with What you'd expect from Panera.  However it is typically slow. I make sure I've got at least 15-20 minutes before I'm willing to go."}
{"text":"Came to this location on Thursday right at lunch time. When I walked in, there was no line but a number of people at tables having food/coffee.

The cashier was super pleasant and I was through to the pickup window in no time. Everyone who worked here actually seemed to really be enjoying themselves! The pickup window is tucked towards the back, felt a little small and if it were busy, it could be VERY crowded. But a manager greeted me on his way by and the ladies behind the counter making my food were very pleasant. If you dine in, they'll bring your food right to the table - its a nice thing when you're eating \"fast food\".

I got the you pick two, which I think is one of the better deals on the menu. I got a really nice fresh garden salad with balsamic and the half avocado bacon turkey sandwich and an unsweetened flavored lemonade as my drink. Every combo gets you the option of: a baguette, apple or chips. I always get the kettle cooked chips, they're a tasty snack for later!

I didn't feel guilty after eating this meal, it didn't sit heavy in my stomach and all of the components were super fresh and tasty. The only thing I might do differently is change the bread so its toasted or grilled. Not only would it hold the sandwich better together, it would add some much needed crunch to the sandwich.

Panera bread is fresh food made to order, so don't expect to be paying $5 for a combo here. A drink, side salad and sandwich were in the range of $15 - pretty standard fare for lunch, especially when I'm downtown. Sign up for their rewards card, you'll get a free pastry during the month/week of your birthday and they run promos throughout the year - you don't have to do ANYTHING to get these promos. You don't even have to carry the card, they always look me up via my phone number.

You get what you pay for - if you want to spend $6 on lunch, go to McDonalds. You'll feel crappy later because its crappy food. This is healthy, fresh food for an appropriate price!"}
{"text":"Came here again yesterday when I was feeling a little under the weather and wanted something comforting and warm. Ended up with a half sandwich (Turkey Avocado BLT) and got the soup this time (Low Fat Chicken Noodle) and was talked into a cookie (even though i didn't need it - $0.99 for a massive cookie?? Cmonnnnnn). The sandwich was great as usual, although I wish they'd give you the option to have your bread toasted (maybe they do, I'll ask next time) but the soup fell flat for me. It was boring and nothing special. Given, I was trying to choose something that was low on calories (some of the cup-o-soups here will run over 400cal) but I wouldn't get it again.

Now about that cookie... holy moly, they're great. They're massive, bigger than my palm, and it was so fresh it was still warm. Besides the huge size (I was only able to eat half, half of it is for today ;o) ) it had just the right amount of chocolate chips and was super moist and delicious. I'll go here anytime I want a cookie - forget Timmies, these cookies are AMAZING. 

Will definitely keep coming back and trying new stuff!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waitstaff was rude, tables filthy, slowwww service.  They didn't have the soup my daughter had ordered, and when we were offered a replacement, it arrived AFTER everyone else was done."}
{"text":"Got the order completely wrong. Wrong sandwich and left onions when I explicitly said no unions. Will never go back there again"}
{"text":"Now that Paradise is Panera it sucks kids meals are smaller the menu sucks and the employees are not helpful. They served my 2 year old her meal on a chipped plate. Their prices are more you get less and you no longer get a cookie with a meal."}
{"text":"Nothing but praise for Panera. The food is always spot on. Love the salads, sandwiches, paninis and baked goods. Honestly have never had a bad dish or experience at Panera.

Also love their new ordering system. Order online and its ready when you get there. I'm a big fan of Panera."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Bland food. I was so disappointed. I grew up eating Panera in California and was so excited for this to open but we won't go back. There were no condiments on my husband sandwich, dry bread and it was nothing better than what I would make at home. It was a basic sac lunch. I had the broc soup and bread bowl. What a fail. Tasted like frozen soup, the bowl was hard as a rock. My salad had wilted and brown lettuce. I couldn't even eat it. My kids MAC and cheese was disgusting. I can say it enough if how over priced and disappointing our experience was. If the food was better, we'd be ok with the price  plus we'd eat there all the time and take full advantage of the drive thru."}
{"text":"I've been going to what was paradise bakery for years. Panera took over and got rid of my favorite menu items. Please consider brining back the chicken walnut and crumbly blue cheese salad!! Also the new layout makes it seem very crowded. I miss the open concept"}
{"text":"Finally found a Panera that didn't kick out my favorite paradise bakery sandwhich (chicken walnut on molasses bread). All time favorite sandwhich. The sode baguette was fresh and soft and their salads are amazing! I recommend the fugi apple chicken."}
{"text":"They've messed up my order a couple times now.. Probably because its a new store. But! They've more than compensated each time and the food is great, fast, healthy and fresh"}
{"text":"I went to Panera to try the new broth bowls offered.  I also ordered salad and customized one how I preferred. A very nice thoughtful employee, Asia, came to the table and spent a lot of extra time explaining the vegan options at great length that we can order.  She genuinely cared if we received something that met our preference.  This type of service isn't common and makes us want to keep coming back.  We want to thank this person for going the extra mile to make sure we had an enjoyable experience. 
Thank you!"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed in panera . I love they coffee (caramel latte to be exact)  but this pasa week or 2 there espresso machine has been down. The told me Last Monday it would be working again just waiting in the mechanic to get there. I arrived Tuesday and they told me it's still not working. I went in Thursday and it was up and working . Than Saturday it was down AGAIN. I went in this morning and still nothing. I'm very surprised of how panera being a well known company don't have the right resources to fix an espresso machine. I'm going to have to find some other options unfortunately."}
{"text":"Sadly I was under impressed. Miss this being a Paradise Bakery.  We ordered the usual items my family always order...chili, Spicy Thai Salad and kids Mac n Cheese.  Ordered the salad from a disorganized and filthy salad bar.  The employee threw the salad together with minimum enthusiasm and poured the chili as sloppy as can be. We walked the line to pay and the employee was handling the cookies and bread with an uncovered bandaged sprained hand (GROSS)  and to top it off, the cold baguette delivered to us did not have salt.  When I asked the employee to exchange it for another he told me they all must be like that and the  baker must have not put salt in the mix.  Ummmmm...if bread is in the title, shouldn't the bread be desirable??? Also, the MICROWAVABLE kids mac and cheese took nearly 10min. 

The manager failed to clean up things, and present their best foot forward.  Sadly, we won't be returning"}
{"text":"Huge!  Convenient, friendly and with WiFi. Plenty of parking. And unbeatable for a good - and healthy breakfast. Probably the healthiest lunch menu out of all the \"fast food\" chains. And despite the crowds, it's clean and airy."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing customer service. The food is always so good. 

Love this place. Even though it gets busy everyone gives great customer service! !!

Crista was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Modern Greek salad with quinoa was perfect on a rainy Sunday. We picked up the order to go and ate it at home. The greens were fresh and hearty and the dressing was tasty. Also had a broccoli cheddar soup that hit the spot. The french baguette that accompanied my soup was soft and fulfilling. Great option for healthy takeout."}
{"text":"Have to agree with the other reviews for poor customer service here, which generally reflects management issues.  I stop at Paneras all throughout IL and WI regularly while traveling for work, and the employees always have the same consistently pleasant, usually downright cheery attitudes.....except at this location. The girl who took my order was clearly not happy to be at work and never looked or spoke to me beyond telling me my total. This was after I actually had to ask if I could order with her...
This is the only location I've been to where someone wasn't circulating to ask if they could take your dishes away for you. 
A lady with a cast on her leg was asked by another customer if she could take her food to her table for her....because certainly no employee offered to do so. 
So odd, as every other restaurant I've patronized in this area has had such amazing service."}
{"text":"It pays to be nice and understanding. I went to this location about 2 days after opening, and they had a huge backup. The wait time ended up being between 45-60 minutes. Of course people were getting mad and demanding managers as if they completely forgot the meaning of compassion. The workers already looked stressed and they were being super nice to everyone, apologizing frequently. My lunch hour ended and I needed to go back to work, so the manager gave me a full refund. After talking with her and encouraging her brace herself for the people who are going to give her crap for what happened, she assured me to return and she can help me out. I went today and luckily she was the one who helped me. She comped my order. And although I didn't order a drink the previous time, she gave me a free drink. PLUS, a dessert of my choice. To society: things happen. I'm sure your attitude and threats about calling cooperate when they are trying to hard to please everyone doesn't help speed up the process. My food today was fast and delicious. Good karma is the best!"}
{"text":"Don't order take out if you want your order right! On more than one occasion I have gotten to my destination with incomplete orders. Very frustrating, as they have someone who is supposed to be checking all of it before bagging it. Sure they'll offer to remake it and drive it to you, but by then the rest of your party has finished eating. How about you just get it right the first time! Manager was so unorganized and argumentative on the phone, i.e.: couldn't find order number I provided and then called me by another customer name, that I told her to forget it and hung up.  Sometimes the customer is so frustrated by multiple occurrences of the same problem that you just need to listen and do what they're asking. Get it together Panera."}
{"text":"Nice curb appeal. Inside atmosphere very nice. Menu great variety cookies, bagels, breads, sandwiches,  & salads & more. Ordered a turkey bravo sandwich, looks fresh,  taste good, I will be back to try other sandwichs."}
{"text":"No value for money here. This is a pricey wannabe  high end cafe. The sandwich was small, not many ingredients, and not very tasty. The staff could care less if you are there and even though the place was empty, I had to harass someone to take my order. I get better service at McDonalds. Save the world from this ho-hum homogenized place and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love Fuji Apple Salad here. It's really delicious fresh and healthy. Panera is my favourite place to eat lunch. They also have the loyalty program. I just love it!"}
{"text":"Maybe the slowest and most unorganized panera I've been too.  We live nearby and go there occasionally but they often forget things and screw up orders.  Try another location"}
{"text":"First time here but we have eaten at Panera before many times.  We ordered a edamame soup and a club sandwich, but the soup sat at the counter after being made a for a long time and they had to add broth to keep it hot.
There is no atmosphere here. There is no music and all we could hear was the head waitress voice constantly booming in the restaurant barking orders. 
The bread was slightly dry but still tasty and the food was pretty good, although my wife complain that the soup was a little salty.
Although I will eat at Panera again, I probably won't come back to this one in particular."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru on my lunch break. Only a few cars but the parking lot was packed! Maybe because it's new...? Definitely not because it's good. 

Ordered a chicken Cobb salad with avocado and an iced tea. For $12 it was a little pricey. Drink is small and salad is probably an average size. I'm a little bit of an iced tea snob and I didn't like it, I don't think it was powdered but just didn't like the kind they brewed. I didn't get the salad I ordered. That's annoying to me especially in a drive thru- at lunch. I drive off thinking I get the right one and I don't have time on my lunch break to go fix it. They need to get it right. Also, they gave me a bread roll. The roll was just floating around in the bag. Not in anything, no butter, nothing. I found that very strange.

The drive thru girl was not nice or friendly to top it all off.  

Will I go back? No. Will I pick Kneaders over Panera? EVERY TIME."}
{"text":"This is just a first impressions blurb, as I have not ordered any food here today. But so far I do enjoy it. A very family oriented atmosphere. I ordered a coffee and wanted to just do some work. But I see the servers dropping off good to people with a smile and asking me at the coffee station if all was good. 
A tad too cool for the patio. But they have one here for when the weather permits. With those items mentioned, I will return and try the assortments of food on a future date. 
For now. Time to get some work done!"}
{"text":"Good location, right off S Eastern Ave., close to St. Rose Pkwy.  Easy entrance and exit with adequate parking.   Close to Chick-fil-A and many other shopping stores.  Nice outdoor seating available.  There is a large dining area with many booths and tables.  Free Wifi.  I did not see any indication of them accepting Android pay.  I love the half sandwich and soup combo.   They have dine in, \"Rapid Pick-up,\" and delivery options. Rapid pick-up is ready within 10 minutes, but delivery requires a 30 minute wait.  So if you are close by, the Rapid pick-up is your best bet for ordering.  They even have parking spots specifically for rapid pickup, so you can get in and out quickly.  Rapid pickup orders can be placed online once you create a free account with Panera bread.  Panera bread has a large menu of soups, salads, sandwiches, and flats to choose from that are mid-range in price.  There is a decent sized bakery as well where you can purchase various breads.  Furthermore, they have 4 different types of coffee to choose from, which you can pour yourself and refill while dining in.  Rapid pickup is placed on a shelf in front of the cash register in a paper bag and with your drink in front of it so that you can just pick it up and walk out.  Pretty awesome, great for a short lunch break!"}
{"text":"A nice relaxed environment with friendly staff. My food came out quickly and was very fresh. I ordered a chicken and avocado melt for $9 and for an additional  $1 they added a pastry. The pastry selection looked great and i thought was a nice treat to take home for later"}
{"text":"The RUDEST staff ever! I ordered rapid pick up and they made my order for in the restaurant. When I asked if my order was made by mistake, I got so much attitude!!!! If you're looking for rude customer service, this is the place to go. I will now go out of my way to NOT go to this location"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast while waiting for some friends. Only giving it stars coz the morning souffles were delicious. The mango smoothie didn't really have a great taste to it. Was disappointed on how it game as well: plastic glass. I was at least hoping it came in an actual glass. Honestly, I just come maybe once a year for their souffles just as a reminder. 2 souffles would already cost you 10$. don't even bother with their mango smoothie, you'll find better one's outside for a cheaper price, better taste, and much more presentable."}
{"text":"Love the food.  Place is clean.  But the girl today working the register was awfully unfriendly.  Had a bad attitude.  Was super unpersonable.  Maybe work on the customer service.  Or put her in the back.  Because she obviously doesn't like people. I think her name was Davatonia?"}
{"text":"Walked in and walked right back out. Normally is ok. This time we watched a girl drop all the cups onto the dirty floor and proceed to pick them up and put them back to be used.  Told the manager that was gross and she seemed to not care much about that fact.  Disgusting.  What else have you dropped and put back? I won't ever be coming back to this location.  Just disgusting."}
{"text":"Needed a quick breakfast before heading back on the road and ordered their Steel Cut Oatmeal with Almonds, Quinoa & Honey. I'd say that I liked it, but didn't love it. I thought it was a bit on the dry and bland side. But I asked for almond milk to pour over my oatmeal which helped. 

This place is always a favorite for casual dinning or their macaroni and cheese."}
{"text":"It never ceases to amaze me how over priced Panera is for the low quality of food you are getting.  The fact that I have to pay close to ten dollars for a crappy half sandwich or soup or a salad is unreal.  I have tried to get their chicken noodle soup a few times and I usually end up getting around ten noodles and four carrots.  None of the food is delicious.  Their salads are probably their best product, but something I could get anywhere.  This location does not even have water cups out at the drink machine.  When I asked for one, they gave me one that is the size of an over sized shot glass.  Their wifi is terrible and barely anything on my phone would load.  I will be avoiding Panera at all costs."}
{"text":"A fairly new Panera location - not on my GPS even with a current map update.  Located along a very busy stretch of the ordinarily-busy Eastern Ave.  Lots of great shopping nearby.  Lots of parking in the lot and good, comfortable seating.  Food is very consistent, as you'd expect from Panera Bread."}
{"text":"Another trip to Vegas and another visit to Panera Bread.  Unfortunately, nothing new to report.  Service was friendly, attentive, and quick while the soup (chicken stew) and sandwich (Mediterranean Veggie) were excellent as usual.  One of these days, I'll try the salad but in crisp (but not actually cold) autumn weather, their delicious soup is an awesome way to warm up."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place near my office for soups and variety of breads they offer. The place is cozy and the service is super fast."}
{"text":"I came in to meet someone for a consultation and to complete some work after the meeting. I ordered a green passion power smoothie and a cinnamon crunch bagel with honey walnut spread. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was inviting and relaxed. The prices are a little on the higher side for breakfast items but I'm convinced it's because of the freshness and quality of the ingredients. I would recommend stopping in for great quality food and if you're looking to get some work done. The background music is helpful in focusing your attention and the ample seating inside and outdoors allows for space to get comfortable and not feel cramped for space."}
{"text":"I like panera when I don't want to cook for dinner. I order online because it's convenient. The only thing that sucks is that when I order for breakfast they don't make my latte until I get there which makes me run late so I now avoid the delicious Carmel lattes when I'm in a rush"}
{"text":"Every time I go to this Panera they are out of things. Who monitors inventory if u are down to a certain number and the product is popular plan ahead. Every time no matter what time they are just going into the oven. This business owner is losing money due to a lack of planning. If you have one product left and you know it takes 25 mins to make when you are down to three products starting making them. I wish they would get it together as they are going to lose a lot of customers.  3 cars pulled away while I was waiting for my order. Store 1990 needs to do better"}
{"text":"I prefer Cafe Zupas for the selection. This location gets really busy and I feel like always has new people so no one is ever on the same page. I prefer to just order online then go through the hassle of waiting in line."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.   5 people walked by and would not even help!  Ended up just leaving so I won't be late for work.  I understand that you are checking \"inventory\" of what you have but at least ask if i need help or if someone is helping.  Wow.  Unreal.  Even the manager walked by without asking if I need anything. Corp needs to come and train these people on customized service.  Terrible"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places..the chicken Alfredo..broccoli cheese soup and the cinnamon twist are like heaven!"}
{"text":"Panera is Panera right!? 

Pros about this location - They will bring your food out to you, rather than going to the counter with your buzzer when it's ready.

Cons about this location - Their espresso machine was down when I went there. So much for a soy latte."}
{"text":"Being a huge Panera fan and on a business trip in the area I assumed this Panera would be a safe bet for a nice breakfast before heading into the office.

Slow service, leftover cold soufflé and an empty coffee pot caused this cost to be very disappointing. The staff appeared to be miserable and not a smile among anyone. I am assuming the DM will work on improving the service here but who knows??

Still a Panera fan but would look elsewhere before returning here."}
{"text":"Very easy walk from Hughes Center one of the better options to choose from in this complex their Thai spicy chicken salad with sandwich or mac & cheese from the you picked two is just the perfect amount for lunch. I have been here a couple times now and have been very pleased."}
{"text":"I came in here on my lunch break and was very impressed. My southwestern salad and baked potato soup was delicious and ready in under 5 minutes! Rapid order is definitely the way to go.  If you are touch screen savvy it's a very simple ordering process.  Thanks Panera for actually giving me time to order and eat my food on my lunch break!"}
{"text":"I found this Panera location to be spacious and kept clean. I was a bit confused about where to start placing my order and where to go, and the employee in that area was impatient, but everything was fine once the assembly of my salad began. All of the ingredients looked fresh and well-stocked.

I had the whole-size strawberry poppyseed salad with chicken. It tasted great; the amount of dressing was perfect, too, enough to moisten without drowning the salad. I had a piece of French baguette along with it, and found it fresh and pleasantly chewy. My companions seemed to enjoy their food, too, and we were able to sit and talk for two hours there. The restaurant was consistently busy through that time but never packed. An employee was kind enough to take pictures of our group for us, too.

My overall impression of the place was good (though I also see why many of the other Yelp reviews are critical of the customer service), and I wouldn't mind returning here."}
{"text":"I love panera. I am so used to getting their half and half. My go to was the bacon turkey bravo and a cup of broccoli cheddar. Lately, I've been wanting something on the light side. I chose the Mediterranean chicken and quinoa salad and an avocado turkey blt. I think the total calories for those two items is 500, which is amazing and so filling! I usually get it with an apple, but sometimes you have to ask because they'll forget to sometimes. So I took off one star because I feel that though the order is the same, my experience is not consistent. Sometimes the salad is bigger sometimes the sandwich smaller, sometimes they'll give me bread and sometimes they'll ask if I want an apple. Also, today, I was given a sticky fork that looks like it wasn't washed thoroughly. Last week when I went, there was only one table to sit at because the rest of the tables were dirty and not wiped down. So it's those things that prevent me from giving the five star."}
{"text":"I'm excited to say that Panera Bread has finally opened up in the area.  I went there this morning for coffee, but the pastries, salads, bagels, sandwiches and sweets all looked very tempting.

My coffee was fresh and not bitter, great selection of sugars and honey for coffee. 

I'm looking forward to go back and try the salads."}
{"text":"First and last time. 
Service: She seemed annoyed that we had questions with not being helpful what so every.
Food: For the price I expected way better food. They \"creamy\" soup was not creamy at all and was very sour. The sandwich was nothing special.
Totally unimpressed."}
{"text":"I placed a rapid pick up order. Went to pick it up and arrived at the estimated time they said it would be ready. It was not ready so I waited. 40 minutes later still no food so I asked the workers behind the counter if my order was being made. They didn't have it in their system and asked to see my order confirmation. After seeing that they finally made my order. I get back to work (having wasted my lunch break waiting for this food) and there is no dressing for the salad. I won't be coming back here and I will not be placing anymore catering orders for our company with them."}
{"text":"Love love love panera but when we came in tonight we didn't have that great of an experience. We were greeted with a hello which was nice, but when we were ordering the cashier seemed like she had better things to do than to take our order. She was not friendly at all. It kind of made me feel uncomfortable because she seemed like she didn't even want to speak with us. Disappointing. Maybe it was because it was almost the end of the day or whatever but I work in customer service and that type of attitude would not be tolerated. However the girl that brought our food to us was very friendly."}
{"text":"Upon recently arriving from California, my nephew and I stumbled into Paradise Bakery, if only to try their coffee. We were a bit mesmerized by the cookies display, and hugely tempted, but decided to stick to our already calorie-laden coffee drinks for the time being. The coffee was fine, and a pleasant change from the swill served at most Starbucks nowadays.

Upon approaching the exit, we noticed the free sourdough bread samples and dipping sauces, and had to give 'em a try. The sourdough was really good, as much as you can tell from a couple of cubes of the stuff. The dipping sauces, a green pesto sauce and a red tomato-pineapple salsa, were way tasty. We vowed to come back another time to check out the food.

As it turned out, we did make a return trip here to get a loaf of their sourdough bread. They will slice it for you if you ask and it comes to about $4.50/loaf but is well worth it. The thick slices and hearty texture stood up to our homemade patty melts when toasted, and in my opinion, made the burger. This California transplant has found a sourdough worth making a special trip for."}
{"text":"All the food at Panera's chains are pretty much consistent and I always stick to same order I know best.

Pick two: bacon turkey bravo & lemon orzo soup with an apple
This visit I also ordered their newly showcased Power Passion Smoothie.

Bacon Turkey Bravo comes with such a lovely tomato-basil bread, cheese, turkey, bacon, lettuce and tomato. I typically get a tomato soup, but went with their lemon orzo soup for something more simple. It's more of a broth with orzo, instead of a lemon orzo chowder. The smoothie was really good, it was refreshing ! Green from the spinach, fruity and light from the mango and peach I believe. A bit pricey for such a small portion-- might want to stick to smoothie orders at Jamba Juice.

Service can be a bit slow and hectic, but the servers do with what they can with those problematic pagers. Pretty busy location during lunch, but they do have a drive- thru."}
{"text":"Rapid pick up worked out great for my first time, and food was delicious. I recommend trying the broccoli soup. Awesome customer service during my experience, and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Ya know what your gonna get good soup, sandwiches and bakery items and this location in Ballantyne is clean and fast. 
They have kiosks in front to get your order going then you pay in front. A server brings your food to the table and there is a bottomless drink machine as well as endless unique iced tea dispensers"}
{"text":"Just following up with my photos shared. The service was good, I was greeted as I entered and thanked as I exited so that was nice. When I got into my Togo bag and opened my box with my breakfast sandwich I was happy, until I pulled back the top bagel. 
Ordered a spinach, egg white, avocado breakfast sandwich but it's display just messy and all I'm thinking is if there's supposed to be avacado I'm hardly seeing it. Nothing more disappointing than paying for something and what you get doesn't add up!"}
{"text":"Its panera so you know what to expect, super overpriced food for the quality and portions. If they were 25% cheaper I would eat here often, but $12 for half of a small salad, and half of a small sandwich is a rip"}
{"text":"Not really bad, have had some good coffee and bagels, but seems hit or miss more often than not.  And always seems like there are a ton of people who never want to run the register.  I might be missing something, but it's not great.

However, if you're getting your car tuned up at the Firestone Auto shop near it, it's not terrible at all.  Better than a corner quickie mart.  By a bit."}
{"text":"Always love coming to any Panera , especially since they cater to the healthy menu options. Today I tried their new \"Power Kale Chicken Caesar Salad\" yum! If you read my profile I wuuuuv kale, so win win for me , and bc I was super hungry had to do the half salad , half sandwich option . Rack up my my panera points ."}
{"text":"More like a 2.5 but it does the deed. A new Panera location conveniently opened at the Carolina Medical Center and it looks really nice. Once you walk in, there is an array of pastries for you to ogle your eyes at and feast (to ruin y'alls diets). Another aspect of this location that I like is the fast track ordering when you can order via an iPad. Also, it has a screen near the pickup area so you know when your order is being prepared and when it is ready to be picked up. 

The biggest con to this location is the lack of outlets. There was only 2 seats in the whole Panera that had an outlet next to the table. For a destination that tends to tend to the cafe wifi warriors, that is a big no no. It was also unfortunate that when I went to refill my coffee cup, there was no coffee in 2 out of the 4 dispensers. Hopefully this is an one time thing but all in all, Panera is there to feed you when you're in a hurry.

Pros:
Convenient ordering system 

Cons: 
No outlets
Lack of coffee"}
{"text":"My friend came up to one of the workers saying, \"If you were a booger I'd pick you first.\" As a practical joke and one of the workers kicked us out saying that the place is closing with a women sitting in front of us calmly eating. She didn't kick anyone else out."}
{"text":"I am done giving Panera Bread chances. Generally speaking, their food is ok, but the fulfillment, service, and quality are lacking. Usually, I order online for rapid pickup, but I have tried their delivery service as well. Regardless of which way the food is ordered, there has been an issue with each order. 
Delivery is not the way to go with this location. If you want a sandwich or some soup, you are better off picking it up yourself. Both occasions where I ordered for delivery, my order was incomplete and late. Personally, I like my soup warm, but that is just me. 
Then comes rapid pickup, and the issues with this service is not any better. They have a person in the front that is supposed to verify orders. If you let them know something is missing, they take it very personal. Of course, it gets worse if you also tell them that there have been errors on the prior orders. They act like you hit their dog, when in reality, I just wanted to see if they added cheese on my sandwich this time. 
Then there are days like today, I ordered a rapid pickup online, ran in, grabbed my food, and then headed back to the office to enjoy my meal. I ordered a half sandwich and soup. Unfortunately, half my lunch made it in the garbage instead. My sandwich smelt fermented, the lettuce was very sorry looking, and the bread was soggy. I decided not to take my chances with the questionable sandwich I just wasted 6 bucks on, so in the trash it went. I then proceeded to get my soup out. I love the French onion soup they have, especially with the baguette it comes with. To my dismay, the baguette was missing from my bag. This is just an illustration of the same scenario that I deal with each time I order from Panera Bread. This was simply the straw that broke the camels back, and I will not be visiting this location anymore. I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"This time at Panera I ordered the pick two.  I chose the greek goddess salad and a cup of tomato soup.  It was pretty good! From my past experiences, I knew to order the greek goddess salad without the red onions.  The last time I ate this salad there was way too many red onions for my liking.  It was much better without them in my opinion. I have the MyPanera card, which offered a 20% off pick 2 deal and a free half salad, so it made the meal decently price.  I don't go to Panera often, but the MyPanera card offers are great and make it worth my while to go every now and then. I love the atmosphere here. It's a great place to get some work done or grab coffee with a friend.  The food is just meh.  Not the greatest, but  a nice place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Amazing how bad this Panera really is! Terrible is a better description. We went about 5 times but quit going there after the second time hair was found in our food. No one in the kitchens hair was tied back or netted or wearing a hat. Talked to Mgr he was going to look into it and that was after the first time. They still don't control their hair!                                                        We Go in the morning when people are trying to get to work. NEVER more than one person working at the counter. Doesn't matter how many people in line. Eventually those people grab a coffee cup, fill it up and walk out without paying! I'm guessing that one employee is new because if it's more than two items they just stand and stare at the cash register.                   I could go on but last but not least why the heck can't Panera butter a toasted bagel when it's finished being toasted. It is so silly to hand the customer a barely warm wrapped up bagel an throw 2 rock hard butter packets in the bag. They never are soft enough to spread on the bagel which again is getting cold while you're trying to spread frozen butter on it. WAKE UP PANERA it would be cheaper to do it in your kitchen."}
{"text":"Big disappointment today.  Everything we tried to order they were conviently out of.  I don't know if the cooks we're all on break or if no one felt like cooking but we were told they had no flat bread,  panininis or spinach for salads. All they had to offer was basically soup and bakery.  we left without ordering anything and went to a different restaurant. won't be going back to this location anytime soon"}
{"text":"I had the Greek Salad and Strawberry Fruit Smoothie. Both were excellent."}
{"text":"I came early before a CMYE started and was starving. I didn't want to get something heavy so I got a small Mac N Cheese. I normally don't like Mac, but for whatever reason I was feeling it today. It was fairly good, really white cheddar. It did it's job, but I like their sandwiches/salads better. 

Is it the best sandwich/salad/etc at that pricepoint? No, but it's a quick, fairly healthy stop. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Decent food, surprisingly fast, but ridiculously priced - Panera, when did you jack up your prices?! Ordered the Pick Two (Roasted Turkey, Apple, and Cheddar Flatbread + Mac & Cheese) and my total was almost $11 for half a sandwich and a small bowl of macaroni & cheese. Super bummed about this, but I'll let the rest of the review focus on the food and service.

Service: Really nice actually. I came in at a pretty busy time but barely had to wait in the line. My food came out in about 5 minutes, was delivered to my table, and as I was leaving with my tray, another worker came and took it out of my hands and told me to have a great day (which was AWESOME because let's be real, trying to slide the trash off of the tray into the garbage can is never fun). Felt super impressed by the friendliness and calm environment of this Panera overall.

Food: 
Roasted Turkey, Apple, and Cheddar Flatbread: Eh. I guess I didn't expect my sandwich to be swimming in coleslaw (my bad for not reading the small print). I also incorrectly assumed it would be sliced turkey, but it was more of a chicken salad sort of texture, which threw me off. Like others have said before me, the bread was a little too small for what was trying to fit inside and every bite I took I was struggling not to look like it was my first time eating a sandwich ever (coleslaw was actually dripping everywhere). Mediocre taste, pretty rough experience.

Macaroni & Cheese: Panera totally redeems itself with their mac & cheese. They use shelled pasta and the cheese is so creamy and abundant - so amazing. It comes out at the perfect temperature and maybe it's just a me thing, but dipping my potato chips into the extra cheese sauce was actually heavenly. Highly recommend.

Probably wouldn't come back to eat another entire meal here, because there are better places to go for the price you pay. Panera does have an awesome bakery section and great drinks though so if you're not a not a stingy college student like me, I wouldn't hesitate to stop by to treat yo'self."}
{"text":"Don't come here. Don't spend your hard earned money on a business that employs people who can't do a simple task such as put turkey and bacon on a turkey bacon avocado sandwich. That you pay a delivery charge, tip a driver then have to go back to the store to make them correct your order with no apology or compensation. Taking money that you worked for to give to someone clearly doesn't care about their job or just people in general. Probably thought they were being funny, Hope that person enjoys making 7.25 an hour when they're 30 and then piss and moan how minimum wage needs to go up because they're stuck in  shitty government housing projects with bed bugs and roaches driving a 1987 rusted Buick POS or taking a bus. Change your work ethic and don't suck dude."}
{"text":"Thank you to Randy for the awesome service in the drive thru!  Wish North Scottsdale DC Ranch area has a Panera drive thru!"}
{"text":"Love the sour dough bread...they make great grilled cheese. The bagels aren't too bad......they will make due until the next time you get to New York. My favorite bagel is a fresh asiago cheese with tons of cream cheese. Yum!  The broccoli cheese soup is also very tasty.  I love that they have cage free eggs and antibac free chicken. I appreciate that they are starting to care more about the products they are serving. The only question I have is this...are the chickens free range? 

This Panera is rather loud and always busy."}
{"text":"I love Panera, I've never had an issue with them but both times I ordered from this location, my order was incorrect. One time they  sent it out for delivery  even though I specified I would be picking up, I then had to wait 20 mins for my food to be redone and only to my surprise it was incorrect. The second time, my order was also incorrect, i picked it up and went home, granted I should of checked it before leaving but when I called to inform them I was given the wrong food, they told me I would have to go all the way back since they didn't have any delivery drivers. I would rather drive 30 mins out of my way now to go to a different location, than use this location."}
{"text":"Love eating at the District.  Panera Bread has great food, and great prices and service.  It reminds me of the East Coast pastry shops, with all of the pastries behind the glass.  Their Hazelnut coffee is also awesome, (as they really aren't a coffee shop, but have nice selections from the limited number they have).  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I can't even guys, I mean really.  There were people huddled around the front door smoking.  The service was slow, they give these thin little slices of bread when you pay for extra bread and get a COLD lil tiny slice."}
{"text":"Food is eh...Service is absolutely horrible!  I work in construction and when I went in to get lunch I got a lot of looks like maybe I should be there because my clothes were dirty. 

When I went to order, I was not greeted.  I was just asked what I wanted in a very annoyed and cold manner.  The cashier was equally unfriendly!  I felt like the cashier and the server were both trying to just rush me out.  Funny because the restaurant was less than busy. 

Needless to say I will never waste my time or money at this place again."}
{"text":"I really like that they opened a location on my side of town (southwest) Rainbow/ warmsprings 
Very quiet atmosphere, easy to order kiosks, and friendly staff.  Food is always on point for a simple lunch. My daughter loves this place"}
{"text":"I meandered in here one afternoon for lunch since it is close to my house. I have never given it a shot and honestly not many people I know have either but I threw caution to the wind and went for it.

Walking in, it can be very confusing. You've got the tablets in every which direction, and this is the first place I have ever been in that gives that as an option. So if you aren't aware that this is a thing it can overwhelm you. 

There was a very small line, and considering I am technologically inept I decided to order from someone behind the counter. The man who helped me was nice and I was paid up in less than 2 minutes.

I got a chicken BBQ flatbread and some chips. They were delicious. It all tasted fresh and well done. Just the right amount of BBQ sauce, nice fresh spinach and good chicken. 

I think the only downfall here is the entrance can lead to massive confusion. Otherwise, a great healthy and well priced lunch spot."}
{"text":"I am beyond unhappy with the service that was not only given to myself but to others. I have never been to Panera before and thought I would try it out, mistake! I asked the employee how big was a 1/2 salad and said it was pretty big and the full was even bigger, I went with the 1/2 order.
 Meanwhile, people that came in way after myself and others that waited less then 5 minutes received their orders and left. About 15 minutes into this, I asked about the salad from a employee and got an attitude stating that they are working on it! I advised it does not take 15 minutes to make a 2 second salad, this is completely unorganized business. 20 Minutes later I finally got my salad a left.  When I got back to my office and opened my salad.... I was shocked as can be to find only 20 leafs of spinach ( yes I counted them) that total also includes broke off pieces. To make it all worse, I realized that I just charged $5.59 for 20 pieces of spinach, when I could have gone next door to Subway and or Sweet Tomato and paid about the same price and got a BIGGER salad. Word of mouth advertisement can be the worst or best, I would in a corporate office that staffs just a little over a thousand employees. I will make sure that this becomes well known not to go to Panera because of the rude and uneducated employees about the product the sale. For Faster, better service, education employees, and more for your money, go else where.  NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Both paninis were good, but the chicken was better overall. The bread is what stuck out the most for me especially the focacia. The strawberry with giseng was a very good start for our day because of the energizing ingredients"}
{"text":"This Panera Bread location is ideally located in the Waterfront shopping center in the midst of several shops and a large parking lot. The space itself is much larger than many other locations I have been to and has ample seating, which is always a good thing. Unfortunately, the service is slow and unfriendly (there was no line and it took a few moments for someone to notice there were customers trying to order). I was surprised that I was automatically given a baguette with my meal rather than being offered a choice between the bread, an apple or a bag of chips. Perhaps it is this location, or maybe it was just a one-off oversight. As I mentioned, there is plenty of seating, but our options were limited because all of the tables were disgusting with trash on them and in desperate need of a wipe-down. If it were over lunch or a rush, I would be more sympathetic, but there were only a handful of patrons in the entire establishment. I was also upset that the WiFi was not functioning. Despite my nitpicking, the food was fine and it is a standard Panera, just not a stellar location."}
{"text":"Mady loved the butter noodles and ate the entire bowl. It's a first for the picky eater 
I loved the edamame bowl
The mac n cheese is divine 
Everything g was just super yummy 
Moms favorite...I would have had the tuna sandwich with her by no bread now

Oh mom"}
{"text":"Panera Bread has always been my go-to for a quickly, somewhat healthy meal on the go. This location doesn't disappoint and recently expanded their hours to 10pm which is actually pretty late for the Matthews area. This location also offers rapid pick up which again is helpful when you are in a rush. 

I usually order a pick 2 choice but vary from soup, sandwich, or salad. I'm a big fan of the autumn squash soup with pepitas on top. It's like fall in a bowl. Not such a fan of the French onion soup though because it's not prepared with the signature gooey cheese layer that one expects with that soup. I also recommend the Chinese citrus cashew salad and the Frontega chicken panini."}
{"text":"As an ex employee of Panera I used to love  this chain. Matter of fact I do love Panera but not this location. I've been here at least 5 times and everytime I come there's never anywhere to sit. Unless you want to sit outside and frankly it's to hot to roast even though it's in the shade. 

When u come in there's 2 lines which is confusing because they're calling you from either side. I wanted to try the Thai chicken flatbread as it only 360 calories but the employee at the register informed me they were out of Jalepeno cilantro hummus which goes on the sandwich. I asked her to give me a minute since that's what I had planned on ordering. I wasn't sure what to order even though I know this most of the menu ( it's changed a little since the 8 years ago when I quit ) and they kept asking repeatedly If I was ready. I seriously wanted some brocoli cheddar soup because I love that stuff or I would have left. I should have left. They kept asking if I was ready so I quickly placed my order. 

I went with the roasted turkey Blt on sourdough and brocoli cheddar soup you pick 2 with chips. She even gave me a free drink because of the hummus issue. Thanks but no thanks I don't like to drink my calories usually I try to stick with water. 

By the time I had filled up my cup and was looking for somewhere to sit they were already looking for me as I had no where to sit. All unoccupied tables were either dirty or awkwardly placed in the middle of the restraunt or in the back in an almost private room where a large party was sitting and it was awkward. So I sat in the middle where traffic is heavy *sigh*. 

All this would be fine if my meal was decent. 
Usually brocoli cheddar soup is good but this time it didn't taste like it usually does maybe they changed the recipe. Or maybe I've had it at Jason's deli and their version tastes better. 

Roasted turkey Blt on sourdough - it's marketed to be on sourdough and at panera you can change the bread to whatever u like so I decided to try it on sourdough. The bread was entirely too small for the sandwich everything was sliding out everywhere and halfway through I had no bread. I was left with a hunk of tomato and roasted turkey which was bland and had little flavor. 

I'm glad I didn't bring my laptop which I what I usually do since they have free wifi here but nope. Not today ! Today u get no free wifi. Their wifi is down meaning they can't even scan coupons as another customer was angry about. From now in I will stick with the Eastern location which Is where I used to work and the seating and ambiance is much better."}
{"text":"It kind of pains me to give Panera Bread a good rating, mainly because I didn't want to go here for lunch this weekend but was talked into it. I have never been a huge fan of Panera because as many have mentioned its basically the Starbucks of the sandwich and soup market. Overcharging for something I can get cheaper elsewhere but if I want to be \"cool\" I have to eat at Panera. Ugh!
So, with that said, I gave Panera 4 stars. They lose 1 star for price. Thats about it from this trip that I can really knock. The service was fine, the food was delicious (I ordered a chicken sandwich that had chipotle mayo I don't remember the name), and the place is really well kept. I even had a cinnamon bun to go that was great in the morning. I really wish they would lower the prices a bit or throw in the drink with a sandwich at the least. I mean really, fountain drinks cost them a few cents. Would it really kill them to include it? For $7 although my sandwich was good it was small and I ended up eating some of my moms and my girlfriends meals too.

Not sure if I will be back but I won't be as likely to fight it next time."}
{"text":"The Smokehouse Turkey Panini was good, but my Tortellini Alfredo was far too salty.  The French onion soup was too sweet. Ten dollars for a small serving of pasta and half a sandwich seems rather expensive. I don't see what all the fuss is about."}
{"text":"Great food. However this location is always out of bread bowls. They're out during lunch much and they're out during dinner.  It's only 6pm and they are out again.  Note to management: Make More Bread Bowls Please!  Sheesh!"}
{"text":"Tried the new BBQ chicken flatbread with the fuji apple salad. The flatbread sandwich has good flavor but it could have used more chicken in it. As for the salad, it has always been consistently good. Don't forget the iced green tea drink with free refills."}
{"text":"Why does Panera bread wrap up their sandwiches in parcel paper for to go orders? I got home and it was so squished I couldn't eat it. 3 of the 5 soda fountains didn't work and while I was waiting for my food I could hear the employees bashing Trump. Im not a Trump supporter but I don't think your employees should be discussing politics within ear shot of customers. Cafe Zupas has won my future business. 
Sincerely,

Disappointed"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular and the food for the most part is ok.  But honestly, this franchise is rip off.  Way too expensive for what you get.  How is a bowl of mac and cheese around $8.

The pick two used to be a decent value but now is also way to expensive.

I love to go out to eat but if I am going to spend that much money, I am going to choose a place where the food is better.

Free Wifi is nice though."}
{"text":"Per usual, really solid menu for both breakfast & lunch. Satisfying plus fast. I tried the new kiosk option and had a little problem,  but the staff and Manger were quick & eager to assist.   A really good option for a fast,  healthier option"}
{"text":"Walk in Sunday morning with wife and 2 daughters.  3 employee s standing around talking manager sitting at a table.  No one would come to register to take our order so we had to order on kiosk.  Not very easy to navigate for multiple orders.   20 minutes later we get our order.  Which was wrong  but we didn't have time to wait and get it fixed.  Customer service not a priority here"}
{"text":"Your run of the mill, chain food restaurant, where the prices are high and the quality of food is blerrggggggg.

Mind you, the whole add a pastry for 99 cents gimmick sure gets me going, their pastries here are usually pretty good if you get there early.
Most of the time I come in here I get the grilled cheese sandwich, there's nothing special about it, so don't go getting it unless you're getting some tomato soup to accompany it. If you don't you'll be in for a world of dry cheesy hurt, bleck."}
{"text":"I once loved Panera bread. Maybe this particular location turned me off or my tastebuds and my wallet just got wiser.  Started off with the passion fruit and papaya infused iced green tea that I have had at other locations. Too syrup-y and a bit off. It was lunch time so we ordered two \"you pick two,\" which is a combination of soup/salad, soup/sandwich, or salad/sandwich. 

Items selected:
1) Broccoli cheddar soup / tomato mozzarella flatbread
2) Classic cafe salad / BBQ chicken flatbread

Panera makes a great broccoli cheddar soup. The portion size for \"you pick two\" is about half of what you would get if ordering the soup alone.  In the past, I've had this as a bread bowl and it is a pretty filling meal. Definitely, a safe choice if trying Panera for the first time. 

FYI: the flatbreads are served folded, sandwich style. Not open faced like a pizza. 

The tomato mozzarella flatbread was disappointing. Too little filling. Overall taste of tomatoes and basil are good, but where is the cheese? There was a thin melted layer that only covered 1/4 of the flatbread. I was thinking of a caprese when I ordered this, so I was expecting nice size pieces of fresh mozzarella. Wrong!

The cafe salad is just your basic house salad. No complaints here. Great choice for those that are conscious of calories. The BBQ chicken flatbread had much more filling, and the amount of chicken just right. 

$24 for a mediocre lunch. No thanks. There's a place down the street that I'm pretty sure I can get away with spending less than $18 for a similar \"you pick two\" meal."}
{"text":"Typically, I love Panera- but on my visit today my mac and cheese was still partially frozen. My brothers was even more frozen. This is really disappointing. I find Panera's food to be good quality but I will not return to this location after my experience today."}
{"text":"I have options. I spend most of my day in downtown. But when I need to grab a quick bite in between, and do it healthy, I just get on the elevator and order a turkey sandwich and a broccoli cheddar soup with chips.

Being a regular, or just for having a Panera card, I get tons of special deals. And sometimes they just surprise me with a better deal. That's why I don't do the auto kiosk thing where you can order without having to talk.

Everything is always fresh, WIFI has plenty of bandwidth, service is always good. The manager is nice and all employees seem to be nice as well."}
{"text":"So sue me...I like a chain once in a while.  I mean c'mon, decent coffee, comfy seating, free wifi and more than passable lunches.

Would you hate me if I told you I knew where pretty much every Panera was from Connecticut to Maine?

Seriously.  Can I write one generic review and just post it for all of them?  I mean chains go for consistent theme and product, shouldn't consistent reviews with a certain sameness be bestowed upon them if they succeed?

Is the Panera just off the Maine turnpike in Augusta where I ate dinner and worked late one evening that different than the Panera in between the Connecticut turnpike and the Merritt Parkway or the Panera just off of Fort Eddy Road in Concord, New Hampshire?  Frankly, no it's not."}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery you are not.  I'm sorry, you're just not a paradise to me.  And I hold bakeries near and dear, believe me.

You are a common bakery - I'm not sure how many states you are in but you are common.  Maybe that's your problem.  Your locations are fine.  Nice enough.  You have free wifi.  Good.  But your muffins?  They just don't do it for me.  They fall short of similar establishments offerings in the valley and in other areas.  Go to Wildflower Bread and get yourself a Morning Glory muffin.  This is what young muffins dream of becoming when they grow up.  

And your cookies.  They are so prefab tasting.  My wife had an oatmeal raisin cookie and offered me a bite.  She broke off a good size piece and I tried it.  It was doughy.  And there were no raisins.  And I had to look to find a flake of oatmeal.  But they were sugary in that prefab, gritty, not very good sort of way.  An oatmeal raisin cookie should taste like...oatmeal.  And raisins.  And perhaps a hint of nutmeg and cinnamon, not gritty sugariness and doughiness.  Blech."}
{"text":"My first time visiting Panera Bread, I know shocker right? My friend loves this place and I decided to give it a try. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but my potato soup was very bland, nothing special about it. The staff was nice and greeted us and it was not too busy, plenty of tables open to sit. Maybe next time I'll try a sandwich or a salad."}
{"text":"Ate at the Greentree location last week with four friends and had the Roasted Turkey & Caramelized Kale Panini. I felt so ripped off. Over $9 for a sandwich and tiny bag of chips and the sandwich had so little filling, and what was there was very bland. Sadly, this reminded me why I don't eat here anymore. Years ago I would have rated Panera a 5 every time, but they have made many negative changes to the menu and they have also switched to using less tasty bread flavors and prepackaging their fillings in very stingy sizes. The sandwich I got looked nothing like the advertised picture I called up on the website. I could not even see the fillings without peeling back the bread. The picture of the sandwich on the website easily had eight times the amount of filling in the sandwich I received.

Two of my friends got the Green Goddess cobb salads and were also disappointed in the taste and the small amount of salad dressing. Even when they went back to the counter for more dressing they weren't given an adequate amount. The salads were large and looked great, but failed to satisfy.

I wish I could say this was a single bad experience or this particular location, but it isn't. I hope a couple of years from now when someone suggests this restaurant I remember how bad they've gotten."}
{"text":"This location was not as busy as other Panera's that I've been too.

Had the Spinach salad and had them add chicken and it was terrible.  VERY salty and it had chunks eggs, bacon bits, and mushrooms. I couldn't take all that in one salad.  Needless to say I didn't finish it."}
{"text":"Why do you have self check kiosks? They're kind of a hassle to use, I don't like swiping my card into a tablet device that I seriously doubt has an adequate firewall or antivirus. Besides with a human cashier I'm able to ask her question that a machine can't answer. Such as \"what do you recommend\"? 

I always lambaste businesses that have recently decided to go this way with treating their customers. Am I not worthy of having an actual human to speak to. And the majority of questions from customers in line is \"how do you use the tablet?\" 

So it's not only cheap, it's inefficient. Everyone in line, including young people like myself were quickly frustrated with the machines and had to go to the human cashier anyways to order. How much time does it really save? Could be useful if it was more busy so I'll give you that, and only that. Right now it's just a nuisance to use, hence my review. I have coded my own websites, repair my own electronics and this quickly irritated me. For particular people such as myself, it's not ethical for us. So from my point of view. 


Actually one star review, but I give four extra for your lovely human cashier, Amanda."}
{"text":"Well the other reviews were accurate around wait time for to go orders. I ordered online for a pickup. It said it would be ready in 10 mins, took them 35-40 which the order was soup and a sand-which... Half the order is scooping the soup into a bowl which takes about 30seconds. When I arrived I over heard a person who had been waiting for 45mins. I guess something happened and online orders were being faxed, if the service isn't working someone should take down that option online or inform the 10 ppl waiting.  I  understanding that things happen but the staff were very rude about it like the people asking for their orders were bothering them! It was ridiculous the attitude they were giving. When I finally got my order, no apology or anything for my wait time. Food was normal other than the cookie was under cooked and couldn't eat. One other thing I saw which I thought was gross was they were placing the full sheets of paper that people touched with bare hands on top of food that was being served to  diners. I think that's gross, you mine as well not wear gloves then! No plans for me to return."}
{"text":"This was the biggest waste of money! I just ordered a 1/2 chili lime salad with chicken. She asked if I wanted the combo. No I would usually be fine with 1/2 salad. 
I got 1/4 of the small box with 5 bite size pieces of chicken. And the worst part...... it was $10. Can't say anything bad about the girl that helped me in the drivethru- she was nice. I will not be going here again!"}
{"text":"Came in tonight and ordered a sandwich and soup. I really wasn't feeling very well so i didn't have much of an appetite for any of the food but that's not their fault. The one reason i came here was for the green iced tea however after refilling my cup and taking a few sips i noticed something black spinning around in my cup. It was a fly! I felt bad confronting an employee about it but felt like i should've been refunded at least for the drink. I finally went up to an employee and told him about the fly in my drink, and he immediately apologized and said they would make more in 5 minutes and he would definitely give me a cup, but that was it. They did not change out the green tea right away or put up a sign not to drink from it. I'm a little disgusted and will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"For fast food it is the only place to find healthy options. The mac n cheese is so good. I also love the iced green tea which has some juice in it. The only wish is that they would add some more vegetarian options"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've updated this review.  Morning service has definitely improved and been much more efficient...very nice!

Morning's and lunch are still quite busy.  If you're in a hurry, get here early...before 7 in mornings, or 11:45, at the latest, for lunch.  If you come during peak, you might find it difficult to get a place to sit."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what changed here, but I've heard a lot of stories recently about orders coming out very late and wrong.... i decided to give it another chance and I went the other day for coffee with a friend and was waiting so long and at the counter I heard her tell another employee the coffee she was currently making was for herself and she's making mine next. I'm a paying customer...."}
{"text":"The paninis are generally the best sandwiches to order. Overall, this place is fairly average. You get a pretty solid sandwich if you're hungry."}
{"text":"The food was as good as any other Panera but the tables were dirty and the bathroom was not just dirty but had graffiti in marker (which you can wipe off with some Goof Off) and this was well into the lull between lunch and dinner.  The young women behind the counter were goofing around and talking.  Someone's not managing right."}
{"text":"I really like Panera but this one is awful. They messed up my order so much I just refuse to go back. This was true whether inside the restaurant, getting it to go or eat there, or driving thru. Ordering online and picking it up is a joke. The 1st time I did this I ordered 3 bagels and 6 muffins. Nothing extra or omitted or special about the order. It was missing the bagels! I called and they offered to send me a coupon for a free meal which never arrived. I gave it another chance and this time checked the bag before I left the store. It was again missing several items. The cashier was rude when I asked for the items and told me they were out of them. WELLLLL they still charged me for them and had my phone number right on the order slip but didn't call to see if I wanted a refund or a replacement. they didn't stick a note on the bag to check in with them or anything. So they were just going to take my money for items they didn't even have! they are super slow- over 15 mins to get a basic sandwich. They get the order wrong more often than they get it right. And the store is dirty and messy. The drink station always had a foul odor near it. I now drive past this Panera to visit the Warrendale or McKnight Rd locations."}
{"text":"Here on business and needed a quick lunch. Restaurant was clean and I got my food quickly. I love their lemonade."}
{"text":"Bread bowl was way tough and what the heck did you bake into my cookie Panera?? It's like a string or something that I had to pull out of my mouth after feeling it tickle my throat. I'm making the farther drive to Wildflower Bread Co after this experience."}
{"text":"Panera used to be a favorite of mine when I lived in CO.  They had a great bakery and great salads at lunch. Well that's all changed!  I hadn't been for a while, but decided to go for breakfast since they just remodeled this location.  The breakfast brioche sandwiches were disgusting.  The egg and bacon looked like they were days old, bun was hard, cheese wasn't melted....sad to say that I prefer McDonalds over this mess.  The smoothies are ok, but even worse is that everything is overpriced and food quality is worse than fast food. Why spend so much on packaging and remodeling while your food quality suffers significantly?  Look at the reviews Panera!  Few people like your food anymore so it's a matter of time before you are gone.  With IHOP next door and better lunch options, Einstein Bagels, and Jamba, fast food everywhere that is consistent, there's too much competition for this lack of care.  I won't ever be back here.  Too add an update- I complained to corporate and they added a whole $10 to MyPanera acct - when I actually spent $16 on that crap yesterday!"}
{"text":"This is the best location I've been to in a while they are fast professional and do a good job crafting the sandwiches. I always get the steak and arugula here it tastes fresh and looks great. I make sure to go to this location"}
{"text":"The management here is bad the short woman who came to the drive-through window just now. My sandwich was a soggy wet mess there was a bunch of extra tomatoes on my steak and arugula it appeared that some sort of liquid it got on my sandwich I noticed after sitting at the drive-through for 20 minutes when I opened the rapper I asked for a refund management did not care they were making me late for an appointment and thevsandwich look terrible"}
{"text":"Rude staff. I was brought my food with the receipt ONTOP of my flatbread. Said something to the girl who brought it out and she just walked away. Girl who gave me my smoothie rolled her eyes at me."}
{"text":"Great place for a casual lunch for brunch. We went here for my mom-in-law's bday. I had no idea their portions were so big! I should've gotten the half sandwich, half salad deal. Ended up eating too much. But everything was so delicious & freshly made.

It's a funny set up. You make your order at the counter then get a seat & they will bring your order to you. So kind of like a cafeteria but not quite. Anyway, their breads were delicious & their desserts were good too. They don't have any hot food besides soup & pasta so it's limited. But for casual dining it's quite good. Prices were decent too."}
{"text":"Generally speaking the food is great. I always get the broccoli and cheddar soup. I used to get the bread bowl but I kept receiving really dark bowls. I was told by the manager when I inquired that generally people don't eat so much bread and it's usually not an issue. Umm---I'm sorry but if I'm buying it, I'm eating it. He made me feel uncomfortable, almost like I shouldn't be consuming so much food. I no longer buy the bread bowls."}
{"text":"Always good food service is really lacking.

Ordered cinnamon roll 2 breakfast sandwiches and 2 drinks.

Cinnamon roll was way to get since they have them up front and ready to go.

However the 2 sandwiches need to be prepped and made. Cool.

We saw the sandwiches placed on top of the counter once they where ready to go 
Several employees walked by our order and no one played attention the person who made our sandwiches didn't have any urgency to communicate that they needed runners. Employees where on their phones playing when I walked up to get my food and suddenly put them away when I went grab my food.

Since this is closet panera to us we don't have options and and hopefully the service improves."}
{"text":"Just got a you pick two. Strawberry poyseed salad with chicken...The sizes are smaller. They forgot to add chicken....so disappointed!!"}
{"text":"What can I say, Panera is one of my favorites. It's my go-to when I want to be healthy and it is so convenient because there are a lot of Panera restaurants around town. First- let's talk about their salads. HUGE bowls- with everything delicious under the sun. What I really enjoy about their salads, is that you can add additional things to your meal. The salad you're choosing doesn't have blueberries? Add it! Does the salad not have feta cheese and you really want feta, add it! You just can't beat that. 

They also have a wide variety of soups & sandwiches. Which goes perfectly with their \"pick 2\" option. Where you can enjoy both a soup & a sandwich for you meal. 

The restaurants are always consistently clean, and they always have fresh breads & pastries - but I am not 100% sure if they bake them all in store. 

I eat at Panera so much, I am a club member- free to join, and you get to enjoy special treats. Makes me feel like a VIP!"}
{"text":"Let me say that I absolutely Love Panera, which is why I decided to give the new location a shot. I drove by several times thinking that judging from the outside it would not give me the \"coffee shop/lounge/work vibe\" that I enjoy. Today, I didn't judge from the outside and actually came in to order, sit, and attempt to work. There's an odor when you walk in that sort of smells like old hard boiled eggs or something. I'm not quite sure what that's about. Myself and another lady walked in at the same time to the counter and stood there for about 5-6 mins or so before she walked to ask if someone could come to assist us. I ordered and she picked up her catered order about 3 mins later. The cashier apologized and said she was solo today. My food took no time to come out. The staff here is friendly and courteous. I struggled to find a place to sit bc I was looking for an outlet in which to plug up and get busy while I ate. Unlike other locations, these seems to be in short supply. The tables are pretty close which made it difficult to walk through and it doesn't make for much privacy whether you're working or wanting to have a private conversation. There's a slight odor of sewage around the restroom area as well (not the  smells that guests leave from time to time). Overall, I think there's definitely some room for improvements and adjustments this being a new location and all; however I will enjoy my usual Panera spot in the interim."}
{"text":"So, I come in order my food go sit down and wait. 10 minutes goes by when a server comes over and says sorry we don't have the soup you ordered. Okay, I'll order another soup. I go sit back down and she comes back again and says oh we hadn't changed the soup menu yet. It's 11:50am I can't be the first person to order soup. I ask for a manager and request a refund. His response is ok. Never offers to make sure that I'm a return customer never offers any resolution to my frustration. Just says ok here's your money. Manager should try to make it right not just let a customer storm off. I was never disrespectful or foul word. Poor management."}
{"text":"I've tried Paradise Bakery before.  This location lacks staffing and I always feel rushed and belittled for asking questions.   

Today I went in with myself and two kids.  Nobody in line the girl had her order pad.  I wanted a soup bread bowl.  She told me I have to order it down the line, this part is just sandwiches.  I do need a turkey sandwich.   Instead of grilled cheese can I order an adult grilled turkey?  Turkey is toasted but we can grill it.  OK great. Didn't happen.  It came out toasted nothing on it but two slices of turkey, dry, no cheese with 4 tomatoes.   Kids hate tomatoes.   I will deal with it and peel off the tomatoes. 

Back to the line thing, I am in the salad section.   My oldest son wanted a kids half Caesar salad.  Ok.  This is going well.  I am moving down the line.  The same girl from sandwiches now is in the soup section.   Only 2 guys behind me, no worry about a rush.  I order a soup bread bowl.  We may be out of bread bowls.  You can go back to the sandwich section and order a sandwich.   Ha this is getting humorous.   I wonder if I go back will she follow me?  Another girl comes up and says they do have bread bowls.  Clam chowder nope not there not here I wonder where it is.  I found it.  Makes you feel like they don't sell much soup.  

OK ring me up.  I need a soda and cup of water for my son.  She hands me one cup.  I break the silence and apologize.  Trying to get some compassion,   told her I haven't been here in years.  Is this the water cup? No they are over there.   Forget about asking for silverware.   She is too disengaged.   I won't even bother I will search down silverware.  I still can't leave just yet.  This kids salad says something about yogurt and a cookie.   Oh yea, I forgot, I will get.  The sandwich guy comes over.  I am the only one while the other two behind me still reading the menu.  My son has #48 on the table.  He says he really needs the number back.  Let me move out of this line get the number while sandwich/soup/cashier is looking for a kids yogurt. I hope my youngest doesn't pull down the tray while I retrieve #48.  In the whole place only one other table is in use.  It is not busy and his look felt like it was urgent I get that number back.  

Finally to a table.  I'm in a good mood.  This whole order thing seemed comical.  Just a tiny bit of soup in this bread bowl.  Not much to eat there.  My oldest son had his salad.  He liked.   My younger son isn't having anything to do with a dry turkey sandwich.   I ordered it off the adult menu because I thought there might be something more to it.  Nope.

Let's go.  No rush to come back.  

In the back of my mind I recall my niece who worked there for a summer job in 2013.  She hadn't got her food handling card.  She told me only one person had it and the manager said there was no rush.  I hope that's not the current case.  

It's too bad.  It could be a nice place."}
{"text":"At the time of this writing I am in this location awaiting my food. As I was looking for a table, I found plenty, but couldn't find one that was clean. The floors were dirty too. The guy who is bringing the food, looks to double as the cleaner too. I think they need another person. Well I got a quinoa beet salad which is pretty tasty, but it's been ten minutes, and they still haven't brought my tortilla soup. I'm guessing I'll be finished with the salad before it comes...15 minutes half the salad is gone...finally asked where it is.. he now has a helper  sweeping. He is back with my tortilla soup! Was it worth the wait? Most definitely! I'll change it from 2 to 3 stars now, but since o had to go to the car and get my Clorox wipes to clean and DISINFECT the table.. no more than Three stars"}
{"text":"We ordered a pick two deal.  The order taker showed us the size bowl we'd be getting, however the bowl we actually got was less than half the size. Also the salad we got had chicken that was very undercooked, too the point we wouldn't eat it in fear of gettin salmonella. Upon bringing it to the attention of the clerk, they said the chicken comes precooked and we just microwave it to desired temperature.  Yep, won't be eating at Panera again. $20 for microwaved chicken and small portion size. No thanks."}
{"text":"Panera's is an experience no matter where you visit.  But depending on the staff food presentation can vary.  The one in Monaca is always great.  This one was okay but I tend not to eat there -- just coffee and a place to work occassionally.  My main Panera's is in Monaca."}
{"text":"For me Panera's is a decent coffee place and bagel.  I stay away from the overpriced lunch items. Service has always been good; parking adequate.  But I am always surprised by the level of sound.  Many like to come to a Panera's for meetings and as a mobile work spot.  I have found it too distracting for me but it is attractive for others.  I wish they had a mobile ap so I could order on the way and just pick up these simple items."}
{"text":"fresh and tasty !!!

interesting concept with different stations for deserts, soups, sandwiches and salads.

the TUSCAN CHICKEN sandwich (grilled chicken breast, ciabatta bread, pesto mayo, lettuce, tomato, fresh basil, mozzarella cheese and green olive and pepperoncini relish) was delicious. the olives added an interesting twang.

the BREAKFAST QUICHE (spinach, eggs, cream, cheddar, jack and parmesan cheeses in a puff pastry crust) was also good (or so i was told -- JULIANA and mom finished before i could snake a bite).

nice place (right off the 60) to take a break and recharge your batteries, literally and figuratively, with plugs and free WI-FI !!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and the decent food you expect from Panera. This location is clean and well kept. The food order was prepared correctly and quickly. My salad and soup was tasty, and the boy's soup was gone quickly, so a thumbs up from him. Restroom was clean. No issues at all.
Well done!"}
{"text":"Good spot for the uniform and formulaic Panera brand. They usually do a good job here, but the place could use a bit more care in keeping things clean. Table wipe downs, floors, bathrooms...not always the best."}
{"text":"My son and I go to this Panera a fair bit, as it's right by where he gets his haircut. The food is always good, standard Panera fare just as at all of their many locations. You know what to expect, and they come through with good food reasonably priced.
One thing the should address more consistently is cleaning tables. Given that they expect customers to bus their own table, toss their leftovers and put away their dinnerware, someone needs to be out there to wipe the tables down. You shouldn't have to ask. Today, the young lady that came out to wipe down my table left a wet sopping tabletop. I had her come back with a dry cloth. That is nothing but poor training by the restaurant's management. Minus one star for that."}
{"text":"The food I ordered wasn't exactly correct and wasn't good. I don't feel like I'll be coming back to Panera for lunch anymore"}
{"text":"The food itself is great. The staff is friendly and professional and the location is relaxing. The only problem I have, seems to be the same problem everyone else has, which is the price. You have to pay more for their quality. Maybe it is because I have been to too many places that inject their food with crazy amounts of salt and sugar that I find it hard to swallow their prices that rely on good food, instead of good food colouring. Perhaps I will change my mind in the future but for now. It is a really good place for very healthy and good tasting food but you had better fill up your wallet before you go."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting.  Walked in at 3:40pm on Wed May 23, 2018 and it's not busy at all, most tables are open and available but ALL of them are dirty.  Who works here and who is in charge?  People deserve to get fired and corporate needs to step in."}
{"text":"Oh Panera, where have you been all my life! Just last week I as walking by my lonesome in downtown Yonge, looking for a nice place to have lunch when I decided to give it a try. There was a line when I got in but before I knew it, my turn was up before I could even decide on what to order. My eyes were still feasting on their attractive bread display. I wanted them all! I was debating with myself on whether to get a salad or one of those gorgeous pastries with coffee, then eventually ended up getting a half order of chicken cobb salad with avocado, and a couple of peach pecan muffins to go because they were calling my name. The cobblestone bread was also beckoning but I thought there would be less guilt going for the peach muffins because they have fruit in it. I don't even know if that makes sense. Anyway when you dine in, they give you a tracker which is pretty cool so you can sit anywhere and they'll take the food to you. They have a spacious dining area at the second floor where you can enjoy and have a chitchat with friends, or in my case enjoy some \"alone time\". My cobb salad was all right, complete with all the elements-- blue cheese and fresh bacon bits, and it came with a little baguette. I would have preferred the baguette a bit warmed though, and perhaps served with a tiny bit of butter? I want to try their other lunch options next time, like sandwiches and soup. Anyway, when I got home late in the afternoon, I put on some coffee and warmed a muffin--oh fantastic! I'm coming back soon for those cobblestones."}
{"text":"Nice cappuccinos. Soups and salads are good. The steak and blue cheese salad is very nice. 
Tomato soup and broccoli & cheese soups are very tasty. 
A little pricey as salad for two with no drinks comes to around $23 with taxes."}
{"text":"I visited here 2 times for brunch while my trip at Las Vegas. This shop is about 2 km from the Bellagio on the E. Flamingo Rd. It is a little far from the Strip area, but you can arrive here soon if you use a public bus.

I ordered Turkey Chili soup with a bread bowl for the first time, and New England Clam Chowder with a bread bowl for the second time. I realized that it seemed that they dug the bread bowl shallower than the Panera in St. Louis.

I will leave Las Vegas tomorrow morning, but thanks to them, I had a good visiting in Las Vegas. I wish they had their shop nearer the Strip Area!!"}
{"text":"The bread can be stale, later in the day. The wait takes forever. Where is the supervisor? The $8 mac and cheese is so small it's unbelievable. Chicken soup is good. Turkey, bacon, avocado sandwich is good. Panera is way overpriced, especially at this location, where it takes forever."}
{"text":"The highlight of my visit was the Chipotle Chicken Panini I ordered. It tasted really amazing and everything inside the panini worked well together. There was an option to get certain food items on the side such as an apple or chips, I got an apple but it was a sad-looking apple (maybe because it was completely non-GMO and organic). Also, I got a Light Roast coffee which tasted alright, nothing unique about it. Basically, you pour yourself your own coffee; Dark Roast, Light Roast, Decaf, Hazelnut are the options and then add in your basic sugar, cream, etc. The Chipotle Chicken Panini was leaning a bit on the hot side and I was thirsty so I ordered the Low-Fat Mango Smoothie. It tasted pretty fresh but the time it took for it to come seemed oddly long.

Upon ordering, you will receive a table tracker from the cashier which allows someone to bring you your food, a nice addition in my opinion. Wi-fi is free yet it seemed pretty slow. I came in the morning and it was not as busy as I expected, the ambience was calming enough to enjoy my meal. 

Overall, my meal was leaning on the pricey side so I won't come here often. Although, if I do, I will consider the Chipotle Chicken Panini because that was delicious. 

P.S. ask the cashier for a My Panera Card because you'll be able to get a free pastry upon signing up and various rewards from accumulating purchases."}
{"text":"I actually am sort of a fan of Panera as a quick, relatively non-greasy option for lunch or dinner. I really like the new thai chicken salad, and have always been a big fan of their soups. Normally I would not write a review for a chain as their fare tends to be standard no matter where you go, but I am pissed after the service I got at this particular Panera the other night. 
My partner and I were running late for a concert at the school where she teaches, but we were starving so we ran in having had ok experiences here before. We stepped up to order and the manager at the counter proceeded to scold me because I did not specify that I wanted to switch breads on my sandwich before I ordered my side. He rolled his eyes and said something like, \"Ughhh. Now I have to start the whole thing over.\" Ok, so I probably should have said the bread thing right up front, but really? 
Then, in the middle of my order the phone rings. He proceeds to leave the cash register, take the phone in the back room, and loudly yell at the person on the other end for several minutes. Mind you, my order has not been completed so they are not starting to make it in the kitchen and I am running out of time before the start of the concert. FINALLY he hangs up and graces us with his presence again to finish ringing out the order. 
The fun doesn't end there though. Next, the servers who are making our order, the only order in the whole restaurant by the way, decide that now would be a good time to take a break and chat with their friends who just came through the door. They actually leave their spot on the food line to have a full conversation (several more minutes go by!). I am starting to really freak out now, as this whole process has lasted almost fifteen minutes, but thankfully our food comes out before I burs a blood vessel. We grab our food and begin to inhale it, but I need a spoon for my soup. I go up to the counter where a female worker is standing. I look at her, make eye contact, open my mouth to get out my request and before I can begin speaking she turns around and goes through the door into the back room. I literally stood there with my mouth hanging open. I seriously wondered if I had finally learned how to become invisible!! There was no one else behind the counter, so I had to wait several more minutes until someone else came out and could give me a spoon (pretty much a necessity for eating soup). In the end, I couldn't even taste my food because we had to run out of there so quickly. 
I don't mean to be harsh, but I actually could not believe that experience. Could have been an off day, but seriously."}
{"text":"Holy.  Crap.

It's been almost a year since I wrote a Yelp review, and there is something seriously wrong with that.  Short summary: life has changed dramatically and has taken a lot of getting used to.  Good stuff.  But it has taken me away from more than one web home, and I am making my way back into the ones I like the most.  I've been waiting on Yelp because I wanted to come back and write like ten reviews at once and make myself feel better... BUT I'LL START WITH ONE, DARNIT.

SO, on to some SERIOUSLY OVERDUE YELPING.  We'll start with something easy, to get the flow going again.  :)

I recently have rediscovered a fondness for Panera Bread Company.  Sure, in terms of corporate franchising, it's kinda like McBread or Bread King or Bread-Fil-A or whatever... but whenever I go there, I dig the comfiness, the lighting, the music is soothing, I can get on the internet...

...and, oh yeah, I LOVE their food.  Seasonal salads, tasty sandwiches, and some of my favorite breads (Asiago Cheese, Tomato Basil...YUM), and great bagels and drinks and DESSERTS as well.  Seriously, all around a good time in the culinary department.

So why 4 stars and not 5?  Price.  I really really wish their stuff cost a little less, which I'm sure I'm wishing because I am addicted to most of it.

Also, Panera basically MEANS bread, so their name is kind of like saying \"Bread Bread\", which kind of makes me twitch.

Yep.

And so I return to the land of Yelp.  Missed y'all.  :)"}
{"text":"Good place to get a quick meal. I went there for breakfast ordered a sausage eggs cheese sandwich and food came out fast and fresh ! The restaurant is clean and nice tables. Free refill coffee and it just like Starbucks but offers table service . Very impressed !"}
{"text":"I come here frequent and the food is always tasty. However, the service could be better. The last couple of times my food has been ready but I waited over 5-10minutes for one of the employees to bring it over to me. Also, I come during the off peak times so I see employees in the back just talking and joking around with one another. I always am tempted to go get it myself from the counter but I don't want to be rude. Other than the lack of faster service , this Panera is great."}
{"text":"Went there today and it was over priced for the quality of food.  When you can compare it to something you can make at home and it doesn't  even comes close to something you would make with scraps left over in the frig.  If I had made it, it would cost a couple of $.  So we go out to enjoy a nice lunch, now remind you I had a Turkey BLT and my wife had 1/2 sandwich and salad. Her sandwich was turkey & roasted kale. The salad was romaine & kale.  She didn't get enough dressing to stretch the whole size of salad, oh wait don't miss understand me, the salad was not that large.  The little container they give you with the dressing is a joke.
She said the kale in both the salad and sandwich was tasteless and turky taste like it was frozen then thawed and really lacked taste.  She is spot on cause my Turkey sandwich was tasteless and the bacon was not fresh I mean a couple of days past fresh.  The mayo on my sandwich was watery. With my soda and sandwich and my wife's 1/2 sandwich and salad was a whopping $24.49 WHAT!!! that's not even including tip.  My wife left 1/2 of her lunch on the table. I muscled my way through mine cause I kept thinking of all the people who are not eating a decent lunch.  I should have donated the $24.49 to a food program then I would have felt better and then I would have fed 12 people with a nice lunch."}
{"text":"Awful, there food is not great,  their cookies are not like Paradise or in Paradise.  It is not worth it at all"}
{"text":"This place does not make sense at all.The food is gross, their breakfast is awful, & the cookies are not good at all, this place will not last, Hope it closes"}
{"text":"My Yelp friend Cathy H recently wrote a review about Panera Bread's Square One location, and this weekend while I was at the Eaton Centre, I thought I thought I would give this American chain a try and I was not disappointed! If you are craving a light lunch (specifically soup and sandwiches) this place is for you! 
Fast friendly service, fair pricing and a clean inviting atmosphere is what appealed to me the most. After you place your order, you are given a 'Table Tracker' and a food server will track you down and find you and deliver your order.
The menu board also shows you how many calories each food item has which is a great idea.
I ate light today and had the french onion soup bowl which was served with croutons and topped with assiago cheese, it also came with a free side order too ( your choice of chips, a piece of bread, or an apple).
The soup was perfect, not too salty but lots of onions and croutons with a sprinkling of cheese made this a very enjoyable light meal.
Some people may argue that this area is saturated with restaurants, but based on value, menu selection and food quality its definitely worth a visit.
For dessert I had a carrot cake cream cheese muffin, and for $2.49 this was one of the best desserts I have had in a very long time (fresh tasty icing, a great carrot muffin and tasty cream cheese in the centre) I would drive to the moon to experience one of these again, but luckily the Eaton Centre is not that far ;O)"}
{"text":"Oh, yum yum yum yum yum. What could be better than a sweet, lightly crunchy cinnamon crunch bagel with freshly made hazelnut cream cheese and a fresh, steaming cup of coffee to start your morning? Or a freshly grilled turkey, bacon, cheddar, and sun dried tomato sandwich for lunch, with a Jone's soda to wash it down?

I love Panera Bread (or as I call it, \"Pantera Bread,\" 'cuz I'm so hardcore like that) so much. It's clean, comfy, it smells like coffee, and the food is the best. Sometimes, at lunch and dinner, there can be quite a line, but it's always worth it if you have the time to stick around. Oh, and if you need bread, their Country Loaf is always a good choice."}
{"text":"So annoyed with this location. On every website says open until 10 PM.  I even called the \"cafe\" wherever that is (says they are based in central time) and they confirmed \"open until 10 PM\" I rush all the way here (20 min)...arrive at 9:40 PM...sign on door \"closed\"  Fix your info!!!!!! Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I have mostly only been through the drive thru because it is too busy to find a parking spot and go in.  The one time I did go in, it was swamped.

They are mostly fine, just overly busy.  Food is good.  Wait can be long.  Sometimes orders have been messed up, but they will correct themselves."}
{"text":"Annoyed that you can never reach a real person, at the actual location until you go through 100 prompts and wait forever. Very hard to order by phone when driving from one office to another at lunchtime and in a pinch for time.  Ok, ordering online is fine...if you want to spend $3 delivery..and are not switching offices for work and traveling. I love the food at Panera, but it's becoming very inconvenient for me.  I finally reached the manager here who was very nice and helped me with a billing issue in a timely manner, which I appreciated."}
{"text":"I don't know why the rating here is so bad, I think it's a pretty good Panera. I never had any issues with it, except one long wait time at breakfast. The staff is always nice. 

The restaurant is clean and has a nice layout. Panera isn't my favorite, but I will get it i it's one of my only options because it's always easy to order and usually comes out fast and smoothly with no hassles."}
{"text":"I think I've been here enough to update my review.  Parking sucks, and it gets so swamped at lunchtime. Pretty much 11AM-1PM.  I have found a way around the madness, however!  I use the self ordering kiosks and think it's a great idea.  If you put in your Panera rewards number/phone number and password, you can order AND it keeps your cc# on file so you can breeze right through. I like it.

If parking could be fixed it'd be way better, but it's not a private lot...so they can't really do anything about it.  

Food and service is good.  Love the butternut squash soup.  I hate when they get rid of it, so I will eat all I can until summer."}
{"text":"Normally I am a fan of Panera, today it was not so with this location. 

I do not eat meat and have not for years so Panera is always a great option for me. I got a salad and while eating it I found chicken in my salad when I specifically made sure to say I don't eat meat. I was fairly upset and repulsed by this. When I went up to tell the employee all they said was, \"yeah that happens sometimes.\" And she said nothing else! 

I was appalled at this customer service and how I was treated. Employees seem too young and careless. Definitely never going here again."}
{"text":"The kids meal is an unbelievable ripoff! $5+ for a little cup of mac n cheese and a tube of yogurt?!?! Tough to find a worse deal for kids meals!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at many Paneras throughout the U.S.A. and I have to say, this one is the worst ever! It's hard to believe that it's actually a Panera. What a filthy place. Had I not already made an appointment to meet with a colleague there, I would have turned around and left. This place is disgustingly dirty. I was shocked! It was hard to believe that it is in the Panera chain.
 
I reluctantly ordered a Tortellini dish and a soft drink, which was delivered to our table. I think that the pasta must have been re-warmed in a microwave, it was tough and tasteless. Had I not been involved in a business transaction there, I would have sent it back, but did not want to make it a distraction. I will never go back to this location."}
{"text":"This is the only Panera in the area that I visit.  They have really shaped up a lot in the past year, and I just love the warm welcoming environment.  The food is delicious and the staff are really polite and value your opinions and complaints.  Be sure to visit this Panera if you are in Hudson."}
{"text":"This Panera (Gosh, they popped up everywhere) is standard Panera I'd say. Smaller patio on the sidewalk and not the most inviting of patios in the small strip of a larger shopping area with Lowe's and Walmart . I usually find someone will come and smoke near you if you sit outside here for a little while (Must resist the urge to slap the person).
Usually clean but have found the Internets here a little slower than other Panera's. 
Bagel's are pretty good but get chewier as the day progresses and i don't usually make it to a Panera until the evening.  Find the food to be a little pricer for the same fare as Jason's Deli or McCalister's but always pretty fresh and good. 
Love the Chicken Noodle Soup though, my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Ordered online. Food was not ready at the time I selected even though my transaction was completed two hours prior. There were no apologies from the management for this, and I had to ask TWICE about when I'd get my order. The salad did not have much protein at all and the lettuce was dry and tasteless. The iced tea tasted \"off,\" too. I am not hurrying back as this particular Panera is substandard. It wasn't like that 5-6 years ago. Also, I saw a worker drop a stack of plastic drink cups on the floor and return them to their regular place instead of discarding them since they had been contaminated by touching the floor."}
{"text":"It was alright. Nothin special goin on about this place.
Overhyped. 

Food was adequate. Tasty smoothie recommended by other yelper - spinach peach n mango.

Took quite a while to be served our food."}
{"text":"I've been to dozens of Paneras and for early Paradise Bakery chains over the years, and the food is always high quality or the price. Today I ordered the same mac and cheese I always get, and always a little surprised at how small the container was. I asked if that was the right size, not trying to be rude, but clearly noticing a downsize. The guy let me know that's the new size (ugh...8.79 for the same bowl they used to use for half a serving), and hooked me up with an extra mac."}
{"text":"I have given this location two chances.. They are consistent. . . . Consistently sub par! 
The first time I went through the drive through and got a kids meal pb&j with an apple. My three and four year old were going to share it while I shopped. When we opened the bag  the apple was whole and the sticker was still on it (so not washed even) and the sand which was uncut as well! Wth! It's for a kid!!!! 
This time I got a salad and added avocado .. The lettuce had brown spots as did the avocado! So gross. 
Up your standards!!!! Healthy drive throughs are needed!!"}
{"text":"Less than full soup and no replacements as promised.  5$ a bowl is too much money anyway.  Will probably not return."}
{"text":"This is a real good alternative to Starbucks -  great coffee and LOTS of pastries. It's in front of my gym so I sometimes refill the calories after hours of work out. No kidding. That corner of Yonge/Dundas is evilish with tons of restaurants, ice cream and break place. 

But Panera is good evil. 

They awesome stuff and their offering ranges from not so healthy to somewhat healthy. Soup, people, is high in calorie. 

People watching is great on the first floor. - you can see the people walking around outside their big mirrors. I realized that begging is a good gig just by watching them. Seriously. 

Tip: there's a separate men/women washroom upstairs, downstair washroom is for people with mobility problems. Like grandma.

My favorites? Whole wheat bagel with peanut butter, their mild coffee and whoo...the creamy soups. Yikes. 

Free wi fi too but it can get packed so Ryerson students, don't keep your hopes high. They will potentially kick you out if you stay too long. If you only use their free wifi."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that I love me some Panera. Usually, I get my soup and salad or even some soup and a sandwich and I am on my way. There new broth soups are awful. Seriously. It was flavorless and gross. I was not amused. Especially since it was so expensive. I will go out and update my review. But for now, it has two stars."}
{"text":"I have ordered from this Panera several times, and each time they forget something on my food. Like chicken, or a salad topping. I have called many times to complain but it never gets better."}
{"text":"Very, very disappointing experience I had here. 

We walk in(me and boyfriend) and immediately you can see they only have three kinds of their bagel selection versus their normal 9-10 selection size. So we ask the employee if that's the only bagel selection they have and she replies, \"Yeah that's all we have, we ran out of everything else, we always run out.\" It felt as if I should have known before I even asked that they ran out and that it was common for them to run out like this. 

So then we wanted to get a soup and a bagel and she recommends we get the bagel and drink so that we could add the bagel for 99 cents. We felt like we were getting some sort of deal, in reality we were not and the price still came out to be $18 including the cream cheese and everything.

We realize the cashier doesn't make prices but we were definitely under the impression it'd be slightly more inexpensive to buy our items this way and it really didn't make much of a difference. 

Lastly, as we're waiting for our bagels, we were told they're out of both of the cream cheeses that we had asked for. Hazelnut had been discontinued, apparently, and the Hazel Walnut was out of stock. We settled for the blueberry which was still really good.

Our soup was nice and hot and tasted great, on the plus side.

Unfortunately, the shortage in bagels, cream cheese, and friendliness from the employees yielded this experience 2 stars. Far from my usual Panera experiences. I hope the next visit is not this way and I can change the rating."}
{"text":"Better than your average Panera. Typical order at the counter but they have a good runner and bring your food to your table. Nice! Staff is friendly and accommodating. Overall it's clean and bright. 

Just off the Main Street if The District you could miss it. Worth stopping in!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for lunch. The food is always good and fresh, they have lots of healthy options, and the staff members are super friendly."}
{"text":"I was here earlier right before they closed the girl at the register forgot to give me one of my sweets , I called and got the manager on the phone ( great guy!) not only he apologized but gave me extra for my trouble of driving back did I mention that he stayed longer to wait for me after I refused to come back next time I feel like such an a$$"}
{"text":"I remember this being better. Maybe because I ate it when I was a college student and this was as close to healthy as I could get with my very limited budget.

Panera messed up my friends order. Nope he did not do any changes.. they just messed up the order itself.
My salad was ok. The soup is good. all in all.. very normal and blandish lunch

Why? isnt this how I remember... so sad."}
{"text":"The place was very clean and nice. I had a half salad with soup, and honestly it was huge.
It came with bread and over all everyone was happy.
Of course I wouldn't eat there everyday, but that's just me, because I like to cook my own food."}
{"text":"I was dragged here due to Kay holding in her possession a Panera gift card and because we needed to meet with some folks from the 3 Rivers Ferret Council. 

Unsure as to what to order, I went with a tuna salad sandwich on rye that left me perplexed as to why Panera's bread is so well-liked. This was spongy, Value Time-grade material one could buy a loaf of at Wal-Mart for less than the price of the entire sandwich. The tuna salad was mushy and only mildly flavorful, tasting like something dished out at a hospital cafeteria at lunchtime. 

Panera's saving grace (aside from free wi-fi and a self-serve soda fountain) is its chocolate chip cookies. Fall-apart toasty, I kept wondering where the chocolate ended and the cookie began during every bite. The chips had a deep cocoa flavor, and the cookie itself had a lightly crunchy exterior to offset the plush, gooey, humid interiors. 

The facilities were well-kept, the employees were friendly, and the service was adequate. We were all amused by the feisty, colorful, and upbeat elderly cashier/order-taker who kept giving patrons movie recommendations a la Gene Shalit."}
{"text":"The lady and I played the You-Pick-2 game as well yesterday whilst burning a spare couple of hours during Kay's car inspection at the neighboring Jiffy Lube. 

Faithful (archivists?) readers will know that I swore off Panera after a visit to the Monaca franchise 2.5 years back, but with no other sit-down dining options within safe walking distance (no sidewalks, lots of cars, busy highway), we were cornered.

I still resent Panera's ordering system and how employees resent those who've not gotten the hang of it.

Or maybe its that I just hate having my name called out with no amplification after placing an order and from there having to figure out which meal is mine by looking at it -- sandwiches can all look the same sometimes. Also unappreciated was the impatient, glowering manager who seemed to have come straight from a reform school cafeteria. Third, I can't understand why savory breakfast items are to be ordered at one station while lunch and dinner items are to be ordered at another. Making this more confusing is that some of the breakfast items are only available during certain hours. Furthermore, specials aren't listed on the menu board. Instead, they flash on a screen for a few seconds at a time. Shucks, I might have tried that Country Mushroom Truffle soup with half a Grilled Fontina Cheese Sandwich had I known they were on tap as they both looked pretty tasty. Alas, I didn't notice them until after we put our order through and sat down. 

My Turkey Avocado wasn't a bum deal, however, as I wasn't expecting such thick, succulent cuts of gobbler. I just wish that Chicken Noodle Soup didn't taste like  bouillon-enhanced dishwater. 

Bimbo Desserts: Panera has a harem of 'em. Only the warm, rich chocolate chip cookie stood out, though. I'm sure she's in night school. The rest of them are just partying after hours while living with grandma and chasing after guys in bands. The Red Velvet cookie was beautiful to look at but was hard to strike up a conversation with. A errr...\"chocolate pastry\" was merely a cold, croissant-like thingamajig with a candy bar stuck inside. She was aloof but only because she has little to say of importance or intelligence. 

A boring but pretty or pretty boring cinnamon roll or bun or whatever came home with Kay and I once the party was over. She was crying because her boyfriend was being a cad and ditched her, taking the car with him. So she spent the night on our futon. We're too nice, eh? 

And she's still here. Eating Cheerios and watching VH-1 and Cartoon Network and MTV. When she's not doing that, she's texting said boyfriend about his new girlfriend, what she looks like, wondering whether or not she knows her, etc. 

Someone take Cinndy (yes, with 2 n's). Please. If her grandma won't take her back, she has an aunt in McKees Rocks. Don't ask her about her \"rents\" as she refers to them as. They don't understand her and won't let her live her life, ok? Gawd, she can go back to community college, like anytime? 

P.S. At least the joint is spotless, and I suppose it's a decent place in which to relax and read the paper."}
{"text":"One of the better panera's I have been to. Plenty of seating and the ordering area is separated well from the seating. Enough spots with outlets for workers/studies. Only complaint is that it is always always cold in this Panera."}
{"text":"Large, but crowded by 10:30AM. Potentially understaffed for the volume. Wait times longer than other Paneras. Staff is courteous. Food is always hot and delicious. Great for lunch or dinner but not a great place for work or study as it is hard to find tables to sit at. Low on outlets for computer users."}
{"text":"Slowly, one by one, all my favourite US chains are inching into Toronto.  We often eat at Panera when we're over the border, if only because it seems like the healthier of all the options.

Decided to try Panera by Square One for lunch over Xmas  break.  The place was rammed...line up out the door and every table full.  Luckily, we eyed a family on their way out and was able to move in on their seats.

Went with their Pick Two combo ($8.99) that includes a choice of half a sandwich with salad and chips as the side.  Their Interact/CC system was down so it was cash only and they couldn't swipe my rewards card.

The order was delivered to our table which was a change from the US ones where you have to pick up your own tray once your number was up.  

Food tasted exactly the same as US versions.  The only thing missing was a mass shopping session at Tar-jay afterwards."}
{"text":"The music volume at this location is ridiculously LOUD. I have to ask nearly every time I'm there to have it lowered so that I can have a conversation with my husband. The manager told me once that he had no control over the music volume and I don't believe that to be true. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Salad box was not even half full, almost 7 dollars for a box of air. Service was good and quick. But won't be returning."}
{"text":"A-OK. The place is an American upgrade from Tim Horton's drive thru. The menu is pretty much the same except it costs more to eat here, it must be the wifi. Got two soup and sandwich combos, mine regular and my friend got a more expensive special steak sandwich. For some reason his bowl of soup was smaller than mine and the whole thing looked nothing like the picture on their poster, just tiny bits of days old steak and small bowl of soup all for $11. Next time I'll just get shawarma for the same amount of money or go to Tims instead. Yes, I AM CANADIAN!"}
{"text":"Let me guess you're tired of fast-food joints? Of course, you are because that's how you ended up here am I right?

The food here consists of soups, salads, and bakery items, which aren't too shabby, but definitely not Michelin star material. 

Well, you can't everything now can you? However, what you can have a is reasonably priced meal that will satisfy your stomach."}
{"text":"So there are very mixed reviews on Panera. Most reflect Panera in general and not this specific location. This review is no different.
Here is the good: The Manager at this location in Stow, has a great leadership style. He jumps in to help staff, is involved with Customers and has a great presence. I have visited other Panera's and have not seen the same traits in their Managers.
As far as Panera menu choices, 
the Egg and Gouda Cheese Sandwich for breakfast
is reasonably priced. Add the Hazelnut Coffee and you have a perfect meal. This is only available until 11:00 AM.
I often order the Pick Two for lunch. The Tomato soup and Grilled Cheese Panini are best, but portions are small for the price. The total cost with drink for two people is $25.00.  This is very expensive for the amount of food you will see on your plate. The half sandwich is 3 bites of food.
At this location, the ambiance is nice with gas fireplaces for Winter months. But the dining room is very small. There is outdoor seating for Summer months. 
At last, Panera finally has their menu online. This is a great improvement over just having the menu on the wall.
The only real concern at this location is a really odd one. The coffee cups smell like moth balls. Hoping they correct this soon.  (Moth balls and food, not a good combo).
Biggest pet peeve with Panera in general, is that they don't serve crackers with the soup. Instead, they give you a slab of French Bread that is as hard as a rock. 
When I asked management in Fairlawn about this philosophy (behind a choice like this), they told me  \"Crackers aren't healthy.\"
I still have a smirk on my face about this comment, glanced over at their meat choices, chips instead choice, and find that reply and scripted material enough for a Seinfeld episode."}
{"text":"This Panera sucks... I've been like 5 times and every time, they have messed up my order. Sure, half the time they give you a free cookie to compensate, but still pretty annoying. The food is fine, just make sure to add an extra 10 minutes to your order time for them to mess up and remake your food. Doesn't matter if you order online or in person, they'll mess it up."}
{"text":"To start with the Pepsi machine is not only out carbinated water but most of the syrup for the drinks was empty. it's been 20 minutes since management was informed and still nothing. I checked it before leaving now the entire machine is shut down.

I had the Italian. it was just a wad of tore up meat and dry as a bone. All the bakery goods looked old, dried out, this must be  the worst Panera Bread store ever.

Bad Food Bad Service NO DRINKS! glad I paid $13 to eat horrible food and drink water when I paid for a drink. do not go Massive Waste of Money"}
{"text":"I love panera! Super delicious food. I am a big fan of the salads, the bread, and the french onion soup. It's my favorite! I also really like the bagels and muffins and all that jazz. It also is a really good place to just chill and study or hang out."}
{"text":"Great place for soup and salads! I personally am a huge fan of the french onion soup and the bread. I think it is delicious. ALSO I also bought a loaf of bread to take home, and it was great."}
{"text":"I went to this location on 4/5/17 and received a warm greeting immediately upon entering from an engaging staff member Alora, and Manager David. I was intrigued to see how this location had improved with customer service and had happy employees. This is a testament to why big corporations need to be more attentive to customer feedback and hiring/maintaining good management. Each person I engaged was helpful and attentive to me as the customer.

The loss of revenue to this location has to be astounding since people like me have not been here for more than 4 yrs after having a bad experience and no response from corporate. I was disappointed that the corporate office feels that they are too good to need to monitor Yelp for customer issue - thus 4 stars even though this experience was 5 stars."}
{"text":"Really want to thank them for great service. I accidentally did a rapid order and hit the wrong cafe and they totally took care of me without hesitation.. Thank you so very much!"}
{"text":"This Panera is pretty consistent. They can be a little slow. During the months where I get a free bagel every day, there have been times when it took 10 mins. to put a bagel in a bag. Aside from that, Panera has consistently good food at decent prices. The service here is acceptable and I've never had any major problems. My favorites on the menu are the potato soup and the chicken Caesar salad."}
{"text":"Not too thrilled with my most recent visit here. I came in around 3:00 and there was one lady in front of me who left her wallet. While cashier went to retrieve the wallet, which took a couple of minutes (an eternity when you're waiting and there is someone else nearby to help), the other cashier didn't bother to step in and take my order. However, when cashier number 1 came back, someone was behind me and cashier number 2 asked if she could help the lady behind me. I was insulted.

However, that wasn't the main issue. I ordered takeout and when I got back to the office to look at it, my soup wasn't full, nor was my hot chocolate. Additionally, my soup was watery. Not cool. Panera is slightly overpriced and I expect consistent servings of food. What I got was approximately 20% less than normal. Of course it's not worth it to go back and complain, but in the future I'll be sure to check before leaving the restaurant. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. See pictures."}
{"text":"The service was nice. The food is good.
I didn't order something complicated but what I ordered was as good as it could be. And, it took a reasonable time to get it."}
{"text":"No cream cheese...how do you do that...what a business...I come here all the time for lunch and it is good.  Never again.  Learn to run a business."}
{"text":"This was always our Monday morning get together with friends in MN. A great place for coffee, breakfast, lunch, snack or light supper. Was so happy to find a Panera Bread just around the corner from my friend in Richmond Hill Ontario Canada. So this morning l hunkered down to a cheese souffle great cup of coffee and Canadian friends. l am pleased to say that the service, food and atmosphere are as terrific here as they are in the Panera Bread we have in the States. 
Coffee and friends go hand and hand here. If you haven't tried it yet, you need to."}
{"text":"This may change by the time you read my review, but if you want to see my meal, it is currently being featured in a Slide Show format above: Broccoli & Cheddar Soup, Salad on endless rotation as currently those are the only two pictures on the Yelp listing. This makes me laugh. 

On to the review: Quite simply, I am a sucker for Panera's broccoli cheddar soup. In fact, though, I am honestly a sucker for all broc and cheese soups! Regardless, Panera is a good stand by for a quick soup, salad, sandwich type lunch. They do all well, and I generally go with soup and salad. You even get a choice of an additional side: bread, chips or apple. I have eaten at several Panera's, and I would say this one is average. I would definitely revisit, but on my initial visit, I felt that the portions were a tad on the small side and a bit sloppy in presentation (salad dressing dripping down the side of the bowl for example). I know it is nit-picky, but at a chain, you expect a certain level of consistent execution. 

They also have a nice selection of beverages, including flavored iced teas and blended creations. Plus, free wifi and ample seating."}
{"text":"We ordered Tomato Moz Basil flatbread..turned out they were out of the flatbread so we ordered different bread. They forgot to add cheese and when they took it back and added it the sandwich was all soggy an not edible. Staff was clueless and rude"}
{"text":"I love Panera but this the second visit at this Panera that got my order wrong. My order was simple but when I get home I find out it's wrong, that's why I gave 2 stars."}
{"text":"This place is always crowded and sometimes it's hard to find place to sit. Ideally combos are good as you get soup , Sandwich and fruit/chip. We ordered flatbread and Mediterranean veggie sandwich and loved Mediterranean more. Also once you order coffee you get unlimited refills. So this place is good for meeting friends or family where time is not a constraint. Over all I feel prices can be little cheaper."}
{"text":"This is the worse Panera I have been to. The service is horrible, the employees are rude and unhelpful. The food is very inconsistent. On my most recent visit, the sandwich they served me has nothing on it but lettuce and hummus and when I asked for it to be remade, the teenager working the counter acted like I asked her for her first born child.  I try to avoid this location when possible, but since I work near by, it's a convenient stop for coffee and bagels... Which are hard to mess up, just don't order anything more complicated than that."}
{"text":"Panera does a nice job on some items.  Stopped to have lunch with a friend who wanted to use the WiFi and get a bite to eat.  

Kind of a soup type day, rainy and cool...so had a bowl of low fat veggie...very nice and a greek salad that is pretty good.  The best part was the fresh baked bread."}
{"text":"Relatively new Panera. Stopped in for a quick morning treat & coffee on a cold rainy day. There is a small gas fireplace above a couple of tables that adds a little atmosphere. Enjoyed my bagel & coffee."}
{"text":"Since renovation, prices have gone up and quality has gone down. My mother in laws usual favorite black bean soup, ended up being mostly broth with a few black beans thrown in. My turkey sandwich had two measly tomatoes and one tiny piece of lettuce. I don't know about you,  but when I pay $21 for food for two people, I expect to be over the top happy with my meal.  We have made the decision to forego future visits to Panera,sadly, and just go out to eat at a decent restaurant instead."}
{"text":"Nice new Panera.  Very crowded Panera. Has an outdoor seating area. The indoor seating area is smaller than some of the others that I have visited.  Has a small gas fireplace  Good tomato soup and tuna sandwich."}
{"text":"OK sandwiches if you're in a rush and want something that kind of looks like home cooking.  I got the roastbeef sandwich, but the bread was a little hard and the amout of meat was lacking for the price. The sauce they used was good, but after looking up the nutritional info, it was probably just loaded with sugar. It's kind of deceptive that they make it out to be healthy when in reality it's no better than other fast food restaurants. 

They bring your food to your table after you order which is nice and keeps the line moving.  It wasn't at all busy when we went (Saturday afternoon of Caribana weekend)."}
{"text":"I love this Panera! I eat here everyday and in 5 yrs I've had to send my food back less than a dozen times! Great place"}
{"text":"Went to Panera bread in Gastonia for a to go order. The girl that helped us was very nice, polite, and helpful. However, we get home and our sandwiches are not fit to eat! My steak and cheese that I paid $9.00 for is a cheese sandwich with a barely noticeable amount of steak! 
I'm absolutely sick of paying $20+ for my wife and I to get crap! These places are no better than McDonald's anymore. And at least at McD's I pay less and get crap! 
I WILL NEVER EAT AT PANERA BREAD AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here once or twice a week for years, but something has changed in the past month, or so. The service level is way off. It's always odd to here Panera Bread is out of bread, but this has happened the last three times! I'm getting a lot of missed items in take out and hte food itself is suffering and seems like it's being thrown together with a lot less care. 

Hope they fix this."}
{"text":"I've never understood the appeal of Panera Bread. Their food is always bland and flavorless, the restaurants look like a cookie cutter place from any boring restaurant chain you've visited in the last 20 years, and the way their food is served is less inspiring than Starbucks or even McDonalds for that matter. I've gone here a few times because it was the only place to grab a bite when I'm in the area with my wife and each time we walk away from there laughing at how overrated the chain is. Their breads are OK, they make decent muffins (just like anyone else) but that's about it. This morning my wife and I ordered two different breakfast sandwiches and two smoothies (total was around 15 bucks). The smoothies were OK but the sandwiches were a joke. They looked like someone sat on them and they didn't come with anything else. Again, it was like the pre-fab stuff they sell at Starbucks. The taste, totally bland...both of them. 

Maybe I'm missing something and the big deal behind this place is overpriced, boring, bland food? At least the service was good and everyone there was very friendly. They get a 3 star instead of 2 for that. Everything else...meh."}
{"text":"I am from the east coast, so I'll admit I was a little excited for the Paradise to Panera change over because I know how great Panera is back east. What a difference.. I MISS PARADISE SO MUCH! 
Paradise had consistency and they were much faster at servicing. The workers at Paradise are very slow..at everything..if the screen or receipt doesn't say it, then it ain't gonna happen. That is, if they can even read the screen...the ordering process takes forever. It's like the employees can't read the screen or the screen just isn't set up for efficient order taking. Then if you ask for whipped cream on a smoothie or cream cheese with your bagel, expect an up charge. They up charge EVERYTHING. Can you say greedy? 
My regular order there is a bagel with cream cheese and a smoothie. That's my thing. I like whipped cream on my smoothies, and plain cream cheese. I went yesterday and ordered that, and they said they are out of plain cream cheese (which unfortunately happens frequently)...so I got chive and onion instead. Up charged of course... so TODAY, I got my order, and specifically ordered chive and onion because I didn't want to deal with the \"oh we are out of that\" talk, and they told me they were OUT OF CHIVE AND ONION, but they had plain cream cheese! What in the world! I had also ordered the bakers dozen bagels, and asked for the \"tubs\" of cream cheese that they advertise, thinking that was a simple thing. I opened the bag at the office, and it's all single serving cream cheese, but they only threw in 8 containers, and I have 13 bagels...so I guess we have to share! 
More ranting about the cream cheese...they used to have this yummy Panera branded cream cheese, which was fluffy and creamy and easy to spread. They switched to this \"Hahn's\" brand randomly, and it's harder cream cheese and I don't like the taste as much. Moving on though...
Their drive-thru takes FOREVER...my boyfriend and I use the drive-thru often when we have our dogs with us because of the AZ heat. We waited in the drive-thru for about 20 minutes waiting for breakfast sandwiches, which defeated the purpose. When a car sits still the AC doesn't always blast as cool as it should. The car was getting hot, dogs were getting anxious, and we were getting frustrated. When we got to the window, we still waited another 5 minutes or so for them to pour our lemonade and get our sandwiches.
These are just recent complaints, but we have had issues in the past with our orders just being plain old WRONG. They even have ansaying at the top of their receipts that calls out their known habit:
\"If your order is wrong, let us know and you'll get a free treat!\"
I don't want a free treat for your mistake...I want my food that I ordered the correct way I ordered it. For a place to have something like that written on a receipt, it must happen often enough for them to need to create a permanent solution..instead of training employees. 
Like I said, consistency in a food estashblishment is important, and Panera has NO consistency. Come on..I just want some bagels and some smoothies.."}
{"text":"Disappointed!  Found hair in my breakfast sandwich this morning.  Talk about starting your day off on the wrong foot.  Also, management really needs to take a closer look at their drive through crew and setup...I don't think the same person making the food should be taking the money at the window from customers, not a good sanitation look at all.  Probably won't ever go back to this location."}
{"text":"Ordered to go and my sandwich was completely burnt. Got home and was quite upset."}
{"text":"This Paners is really nice. It's spacious, they deliver to your table, there is a drive through. No complaints from me. Their autumn squash soup is my favorite and it's back."}
{"text":"I love this place. The salads are fresh and delicious and the sandwiches are always satisfying. Employees have always been pleasant and accommodate my special requests graciously. Only bad thing about this store is the parking (there's not a lot of it)."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for my order today and had a few items left out of my order and didn't notice until I got home. This is not the first time this happened and management seemed confused of what was going on."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's going on in this location. The music is TOO LOUD! I wasn't asked the kind of bread I wanted AND The turkey, avocado blt was like ice box crisp cold.  ... and $13.01!  for that price,  the turkey should be real roast turkey, not imitation ----it was fatty-?  Too many kids that work there with seeming with no direction."}
{"text":"The Thai chicken salad was wonderful. Dieting gets boring. The dressing tasted great calories were low so didn't feel cheated for taste satisfaction."}
{"text":"I was the only one in line waiting to simply order a coffee killing time to wait for another store to open. The girl behind the counter was prepping some other order. I understand she's busy but she turned around, saw me, turned back around and continued without even acknowledging I was standing there. So I left. I'll get coffee somewhere else."}
{"text":"There was an issue with my order and Hannah took great care of me. She followed up to ensure we were completely satisfied after our issue and made sure we were satisfied with our orders. She is an asset to the company. Thank you Hannah for taking such great care of us."}
{"text":"My onion soup was pretty good.
The sandwich was OK. I am not a fan of sandwiches.
I would kind of liked the water cup to be a little bit bigger. 2oz. is not enough water for a meal."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Panera and this shop presents a good option in the Great Lakes Plaza on the Ohio Turnpike without having to get off. I like the Pick-2 options as the Fuji Apple Chicken Salad and Creamy Tomato Soup comprise my favorite pair. The service here has been good each time I have stopped and the dining room provides enough space to be comfortable. The coffee here is also pretty decent. The prices are commensurate with Panera stores in this region and I have generally found it to be a good deal. The cost of a combo with a drink included is generally a little over $10 which, for me, is a good deal considering the product they offer. I would not hesitate to recommend this spot if you are traveling this part of the Turnpike and want a lunch break."}
{"text":"I am always quite happy with Panera and this location on the Turnpike has been up to my expectations each time we have stopped. The Pick-2 combinations at Panera are among my favorite meals in general. The Fuji Apple Chicken Salad and the Tomato Soup are two of my favorite things to pair. The service here is fairly good and the seating area creates a nice atmosphere to enjoy a meal considering it is in a rest stop. If you are traveling this section of the Turnpike, this is a great option for breakfast, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This location even though it is usually very busy, the staff is friendly and fast. I visit this location at least three times a week and usually my experience for bagel breakfast or pick two lunch is very good . Just a few times , mainly in the weekends I have come across some not well baked bagels ."}
{"text":"If I could give a 0 star I would!! How the hell waits 20 minutes for taking out food???  Costumer service is bad. I will never come here ever again. PERIOD"}
{"text":"I am literally typing this review at a table in Panera.  I've enjoyed grabbing a table everyone now and then, and sitting on my laptop while people watching.  Panera as a company has quiet restaurants,  good food, and free wifi.  However, I have been to this location twice, and the first time I ordered soup and bread, and they forgot the bread, and this time I ordered a bagel, and it came to me raw.  Turn-up your toaster, no one wants a raw bagel.  Kinda wrecked the 1 thing I came to order (just like last time).  The coffee is good though...."}
{"text":"Panera is always a go to for quick, yummy food. This location had a friendly, helpful staff. I give four stars only because several tables remained unclean hours after guests left."}
{"text":"Went here for coffee and dessert on a Thursday night at 6:00pm and it was pretty full. The furniture, such as the cushioned chairs in the front and chairs at the tables have cracks in them and tears in the fabric. Very unprofessional for a chain like this. 

We ordered the brownie and pecan roll.  The brownie was outstanding, being nice and chewy with a great chocolate taste. The pecan roll was a bit too dry for me. 

The mild coffee container was almost empty when we used it. It tasted pretty good and I like how they put the time on it showing when it was brewed."}
{"text":"We've been Panera customers for many years.  My wife loves their bagels and cream cheese, so we ring that bell often.  But for me, a bagel is a bagel - not very exciting.  However, today I'm fully enjoying their Asiago Steak sandwich.  There's just something magical about the ingredients - I can't put my finger on it.  The hint of smokey flavor (from the smoked cheddar?  The steak?) along with the asiago roll - OH MY!  My plans were to nibble on half of it for an early lunch, then finish the other half later.  NOPE!  It's goin' down... I can't let this sit any longer.

As a whole, Panera stores are nice and clean.  Their coffee is good too.  While not my first choice for a lunch, I do know their sandwiches are solid, and this Asiago Steak is going to be on my radar in the future!"}
{"text":"Despite my other issues with Panera, they remain my go-to bagel shop.  The wife loves them.  I'm finding that if you time things right, you can get what you're looking for.  Once in a while they will run out of good bagels earlier than they should (imho), but that's business, I guess.

I do enjoy toasting an Asiago bagel and putting some butter on it. Plain and simple, but delish!  

Staff is friendly and the place is clean.  If you *need* bagels - call ahead or be early."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot. Clean, big, and has a friendly, helpful staff. The sausage and gouda soufle was delish!"}
{"text":"I had considered giving this location another shot because it's convenient for me, but when leaving the nearby Target, a Panera delivery car cut me off at about 70 mph, in the parking lot! Not only that, but the kid was texting at the same time. POS location, and I'm not referring to Point of Sale."}
{"text":"Better than most Panera Bread locations. I visit about 1x/month. It's always fast and a good meal. I took off one star because the bread isn't as fresh for dinner, and because the kid who takes out the garbage gave me a look like he hated me. I don't know why. I didn't say anything to him, steal his fidget-spinner, or call him a dork. He just didn't like me for some reason. I don't consider that good customer service. I will say this, though: the takeout at lunchtime on weekdays is super efficient!"}
{"text":"Your average Panera with plenty of space for working and lounging around on your wifi connected devices. Friday afternoon is a great day to get some work done here, but when is not a good day, to pair your work with pastries, and coffee?"}
{"text":"This is newly converted from Paradise Bakery  to Panera Bread. We went there for breakfast. After ordering we waited about 20 minutes for 3 coffees and 3 bagels. We received only 2 bagels. After another 15 minutes and two reminders (one to the server and one to cashier) we received the third bagel - slightly burned ( definitely over-toasted) even though we ordered not toasted. My son got a bagel and separate butter but of course no knife, so instead asking for it for the third time, I gave him mine. The 2 stars for coffee - which was good."}
{"text":"Food quality good - food quantity laughable for the cost.

Soup and half sandwich combo see picture - $10"}
{"text":"Okay, so everyone's probably tasted Panera Bread/Paradise Bakery's food during a visit to almost any of the malls.  This location does not disappoint fans of their standard fare PLUS it has the added bonus of having a drive-through!  

I have two little guys and often the idea of dragging them in and out of a place just to pick up a quick bite to eat is daunting.  Let's face it - mobilizing little ones is anything but quick.  That reduces the number of places to grab food to burgers or Mexican food, both of which I enjoy, but probably should eat in moderation. But no more!  Now I can visit this Panera Bread and pick up a soup, salad or a sandwich without waking sleeping babies in the back of the car!  As much as I love me some fries, this quick option leaves me feeling much better about myself while still saving time.  I hope this starts a new trend and the number of places with healthier drive-through options start popping up everywhere!"}
{"text":"Oh Panera Bread.

I haven't eaten at a Panera Bread in a decade, long before I moved to Vegas.

Saturday, I did a Breast Cancer walk, and the parking for the walk was in the same development as Panera. 

I had originally wanted to go to an egg works or something, but my friend and I saw Panera, and decided to eat there, since it was so close, and we were ravenous.  

The staff was super friendly, and patient.  

The wait wasn't really that long, either...I anticipated having to wait a while, they were getting busy from the walk participants, and its not a \"fast food\" restaurant, so I was pleasantly surprised. 

I had the Asiago, Bacon and Egg sandwich, served on an Asiago bagel.  It was piping hot, and SO DELICIOUS!!!  I would definitely order it again.  

My friend had the Asian Chicken salad, and the Asiago roast beef sandwich. 
They both were awesome.  Really really flavorful.

I would definitely come back here again. It was clean, open, and the staff was great.  The food was amazing.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had to review this Panera Bread only because its my go to place for almost every lunch break i get at work. The food is always consistent and the employees are awesome. I always choose to pick up rapid delivery and by the time i am there the food is ready and everything is accurate. It literally only takes me 2 minutes to park and get my food, which is great since i am usually on my lunch break and want to waste as little time as possible. The food is always so fresh and never had a bad experience from the food at this location. Whenever there is an error in the order and they don't have it available they will work with you the best way possible to make it right. Nothing else much to say but keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"If I'm eating carbs , this is my mecca. OK yeah they do have a few healthy options here but like most \"healthy\" things they do taste terrible. I've tried to dine here while dieting and always end up cranky with how bland and boring my food is. That being said, when I'm throwing calories and caution to the wind - this is a great spot to get your food on. 

I have a special fondness for the egg souffles they serve at breakfast time. They are incredible and one of my favorite indulgences. The one closer to my house in the District always seems to either be out of these or I've even had times where they forgot to put them in to bake in the morning (WTF). This panera always seems to be well stocked. 

For dinner the salads are good, the new mac and cheese is BOMB, and I love most of the sandwiches. The bummer on the sandwiches is most of the healthly sounding ones (tomato basil panini, or sierra turkey) are absolutely terrible in the calorie/fat/carb department and honestly not worth it most of the time. The egg souffle on the other hand I will forsake any diet for any day ! I do love that they've put all their calorie counts up on the board for all to see - yay it's like NY or California ! 

I love the pick 2 combo (2 mini items is so much more fun than 1 big one, right?), and I love the variety. My only request for you Panera (because I'm sure you're reading this!) is why the hell can't you have lobster bisque?? You tease me with Panera branded lobster bisque sold at Target and then you won't carry it in your own store? As a devoted lover of lobster bisque this makes me sad."}
{"text":"Called in store 10mins ahead of time to make sure they are still serving clam chowder and told them we are coming just for that double checking they have enough. when we get there it was out!! and told us we should've order it on the phone...hello? Why the guy didn't tell us we could've done that! Very disappointed.."}
{"text":"This place is a mess, literally! Been twice since this location opened. Does not appear that anyone has dining room duty! Both times it's been trashed and it's not busy either.  Food all over the floor, under tables, dirty tables, beverage center had drinks spilled all over it. I'd hate to see what he kitchen looks like. Big miss"}
{"text":"A standard panera. Place is not the cleanest. Two floors, lots of tables, good for groups and studying."}
{"text":"Typical Panera, nothing about it taking it to the top, seems like most Paneras are a little unkept and workers don't really care for some reason. This one a little better than most though. I do frequent this location and there is an employee that drives a taupe equinox that parks in the customer parking each morning...a little rude, hope Panera can have her park in the back where I assume the rest of the employees have to park so customers don't have to be inconvenienced. Just an observation."}
{"text":"For such poor haphazard service with even worse quality food, I am surprised the place had a line up at the cashier.  I was tasked to go get a few items for a client that liked their baked goods because it was 'All American'.  If All American means bland, spongey textured, and over priced, they need Tim Hortons more than I thought.  

The restaurant itself is large and spacious as it took over a very large retail space at the corner area of the Heartland centre.  The service team barely acknowledges you and looks you in the eye.  My 4 attempts at 'excuse me' when I was at the front was finally acknowledge by someone who just came off break.  I asked for my client's favourite item and asked if it was just baked recently. The answer of 'I don't know' was a common theme to all of the inquiries about when it was baked and how does it taste.  With 5 pastries boxed up, the total rang up close to $15!  I wasn't expecting downtown Toronto pricing for such lacklustre looking baked items.

So how was the quality of the 5 items... miserable.  I would rather eat a stale donut from a 7-11.  At least it would have enough sugar in it to register a flavour.  The chocolate doughy soggy pastry was masquerading as a 'croissant'.  There were zero layers and no texture other than mush.  The chocolate was clearly not real chocolate but a mockchocolate because it had a closer texture towards a gritty peanut butter.  Compared to Brick St Bakery which I just had last week, this was dismal especially they are similarly priced.  The bear claw used the same dough so the texture and taste was bad but even the client remarked how little almonds was on top of the pastry.  When I went online to look at the corporate marketing picture, sure enough the one online was drenched in slices of almonds.  I think there was about 5 slices... just enough for each finger.  The pumpkin muffin was dense and spongey (see a theme?) and I couldn't taste any pumpkin.  It was just sugary.  The scone was under cooked as the dough was still wet in the middle.  The only have decent item was the pecan roll and I think it's only because of the 2 cm coating of icing on top of it.  

Even though the pastries were a disaster, the meeting was not.  These pastries were sent quickly off to the staff kitchen where it just hanged out for the entire afternoon unfinished.  That is a super rarity and just another confirmation that even our office 'vacuums' won't subject their taste buds to awful pastries."}
{"text":"In love with this place.  It's a little expensive, so I can't figure out how the UHS kids are affording to come here but it's great.

Salads are crispy, bread is awesome and they give me free food sometimes. 

Only issue is that it is becoming too popular.  It's not quite as relaxing as it once was.  Line up is out the door sometimes, but realistically that's probably a good sign.

The only issue is that the kids are starting to study there.  They take up the big tables and order nothing....do we not have libraries anymore for this?"}
{"text":"I do not need to say anything,check the pictures say is all!!!! I am really upset!!! This panera needs a new manager for sure!!!"}
{"text":"It's Panera so expect to experience the corporate Panera vibe. The store was tidy and clean and the staff friendly. I was needing some food and coffee after a long night and they were close. After my disaster with Ritters Diner (filthy place) and growing weary of the Starbucks I headed down. 

The breakfast sandwich was ok and although asking for one pump of mocha, I watched as they disregarded my request and put several pumps of syrup into my drink. Other than that, no surprises here."}
{"text":"My daughter and I decided to stop in at Panera on the way back home.
I had the onion soup in a bred bowl and a teaser salad.
This was the first time I have ever gone to a Panera Bread,
The soup was really good and the salad as well.
I would say Panera is in the fast food category as you order and pay upfront and then you pick up your food yourself.
The food was delicious and I would definitely go again.
I thought the food was a little pricey considering no waiter or waitresses.
I would definitely recommend Panera Bread if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Having recently had dental work, I'm restricted to soup. A friend brought me to Panera for the first time. I had the Broccoli Cheddar soup. It was very good and I seriously considered ordering a second bowl. = )  The employees were friendly and the atmosphere delightful. Thank you for an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Panera in YEARS. I just was never impressed with it. I wanted something different and saw this new location had a drive through. That was great since my daughter wasn't feeling well and I didn't want to run in anywhere. The menu is huge! Too many options for a drive thru for someone not familiar with the menu. I felt like the cashier was annoyed at me for taking so long to order. We got mac and cheese, an Italian sandwich, a Greek salad and two BBQ chicken flatbreads. The BBQ chicken was good, the mac was amazing. I didn't like the relish on the Italian, but that's just me, the sandwich was well made. The salad was a huge disappointment. It was limp and WAY overpriced for what I received. It was fully half tomatoes as well. Too many. I might go back for that ridiculous mac and cheese, but I won't order salad here again. Not a great first impression after all these years."}
{"text":"Ordered a to go order, came home with the wrong meal and all they could do is send a coupon in the mail instead of fixing the order and delivery it. Real nice."}
{"text":"Horrible location. My order is made incorrectly Everytime I go through the drive-thru. Staff is not too friendly and often distracted. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Karen is an extremely rude and unfriendly \"manager\". I placed an order to go and she acted as if I was inconveniencing her by placing a simple order. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Panera locations I've been to. There is never a problem finding a parking spot or a place to sit. The staff is usually polite and very patient. 

I don't change it up much, but that's ok with me. You can usually find me eating the Roasted Turkey & Avocado BLT and the Spicy Thai Salad with Chicken ( I tend to go for the you pick 2). I am in love with the BLT. It has the right amount of everything on it. The salad has just the right amount of chicken. It also has plenty of cashews, edamame, red peppers and wonton strips. It is then topped with a Thai chili vinaigrette and peanut sauce (which has a little kick). 

If I don't get the salad, i tend to go with the Broccoli Cheddar Soup (which is pretty amazing). The soup has just the right amount of broccoli, and has a great cheese flavor. And if I don't get the BLT, I tend to go with the chicken salad sandwich (mainly because there are grapes and almonds mixed in). 

My go-to drink when there is usually the Plum Ginger Hibiscus Tea. I absolutely recommend trying it, you wont regret it. 

Now for the best part, the sweets! Ok, maybe not the best part for some of you, but i can't turn down a good dessert. Lets start off with the amazing scones (especially when fresh). I recommend going for either the Cinnamon Crunch Scone or the Orange scone. Both are bursting with great flavors that will surprise you."}
{"text":"Horrible service. This location has never gotten my order right despite how long they made me wait. The managers are also horrible and do not care that their service takes so long or that their employees are rude. 
It is not worth the price of the food for incorrect orders and bad service."}
{"text":"As is the case with every Panera I've ever visited, this place is absolutely awesome. Great food, nice and clean and the customer service was so top-notch, it surprised me a little. My only real gripes are the facts that they changed their chicken salad at sone point (ruined it, imho) and the bakery never ever has their \"blondies\" (the best pastry they ever carried) anymore. Other than that, they never disappoint. Panera=quality. Simple as that."}
{"text":"Nice visit to Panera today. Coffee was good; service pleasant and prompt. Most important, toppings on the bagels almost back on par with times past. Looking forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"We stop by this location when visiting from Charlotte North Carolina for the holidays. Quality and quantity of your toppings for exceed those at your sister store in the Huntersville, North Carolina location. Thank you for the warm welcome"}
{"text":"I am updating my review from before, because I feel as though this place needs to get much better.
I have had orders messed up on occasions, and I can understand every once and awhile, but not as often as it is here. If this were the only reason I would be fine with it, but it gets worse than that. I feel as though this location doesn't care much about food safety. I got scones that were hard and chewy, tea that has what looked like strings in it, and cold sandwich where the vegetables seemed warmer than they should be (if you look up the health inspection of this place I can see why). I have on 3 occasions (one recently) where I have intestinal issues after eating here (I do not want to be too descriptive) as well. 
I ask workers when the tea was made, and they never seem to know; but they have a sticker with a time on it on the tea. When I came in in the morning the sticker said 2pm and they said that is when it is good until; then I come in at 3:30 and it says 2pm, and they say that is when it was made. To me this is unorganized and when it comes to food and food safety; these things should be known 100%. 
I also have a gripe about one of the managers (younger blonde) when I asked her a question she actually looks at her coworker and laughed; then answered. I was a little taken aback at this response.
The only reason I am giving them a 2 star instead of 1 is because a couple of their other managers have made things right before for me, and they have been friendly as can be. One even greeted me by name; and this made me feel very welcome. 
All in all I will not be coming back here, because I feel when you pay restaurant prices at a sandwich place; the food, service, and quality should be much higher than this. I should not have 3 intestinal issue problems when paying these prices, and the employees should know when things were made at these prices as well. I am not one to gripe and complain, but I feel they need to work on these issues."}
{"text":"Usually I love Panera, but after an 11 hour workday I went in for what I expected to be good comfort food. Instead I got some of the most burnt bacon I've ever seen. I ordered the Bacon Turkey Bravo. Without the bacon it's not complete and when the bacon is inedible you're going to get a terrible rating. Top it off with being talked about by the teenage staff nearby because my wife and I unkowningly sat in a section they were about to clean just made for a great experience. At least the broccoli cheddar soup was good, but then it's hard to screw that up..."}
{"text":"Food was good, staff was friendly, the table we ate on was sticky. I ordered a bowl of the cream of wild rice and chicken, and a half chicken Caesar salad. Both good."}
{"text":"Large location with a lot of seating. Convenient location and friendly staff. The sandwiches were ok. Grilled cheese was bland and the ham and Swiss was pretty good, just too much onion. The comp French baguette was pretty good as are the kettle potato chips."}
{"text":"Great salads and sandwiches. Baked goods are good, too.....and fresh. My favorite salad is the BBQ chicken salad and the wild rice with chicken soup is awesome."}
{"text":"New location has friendly and accommodating employees. There's also a drive through at this location and self service kiosks inside. Grilled cheese with provolone, smoothies, and chicken and wild rice soup are my favorite items here."}
{"text":"Great options, especially for those who are looking to eat healthy at an airport. Staff is friendly and quick. Food is made to order and tasty. I usually get a hot cup of oatmeal. Good stuff."}
{"text":"I have never seen such angry people and disappointed customers in my life. Service was horrendously slow! They need help bad."}
{"text":"Although their food is good they are always running out of stuff. For instance my fiancee loves their bread bowls. However 74% of the time they are out. I like some of the pastries they make. Most of the time they are either low in quantity or out all together."}
{"text":"Went to this one for the first time yesterday. kinda a long wait but it was 530 pm. we knew it was gonna busy. after 20 mins wait for our food we leave drive home . we ordered the flat bread and soup deal. we get home which is 20 mins drive look in the bag and only the soups were in there. i dont see going there anytime soon."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and the assistant manager Zack is the most helpful, kind spirited person I've met in a long time!! If you have ?'s or inquiries ask for Zack!!! He's the most efficient and knowledgeable manager in the store hands down!!!"}
{"text":"Would give less than a star. Restaurant is filthy. Dirty window shades? Yes!!! Filthy floors, no employee clean up other than bussing tables."}
{"text":"The salads are always on point but I didn't think the chowder was to my liking...it had a taste to it, like you could tell it was thawed or frozen prior to being served. There are some changes on the menu...which makes me want to go back for more. The paninis and the broccoli cheddar soup are always satisfying! Aside from the clam chowder not being the best, I love Panera!"}
{"text":"About a year ago it was a Paradise Bakery. 
I ordered a half caesar salad with chicken for $6~7 dollars, it wasn't worth it, I was very disappointed. Wildflower makes a lot better caesar salad."}
{"text":"The customer service here is terrible. Slow in the restaurant, slow in the drive thru. Half the time they don't have a featured menu item. My family and I have tried this Panera three times and it only seems to get worse. This place recently opened so clearly there is a leadership issue. Upper management should consider replacing the GM. I really wish Paradise Bakery didn't sell out."}
{"text":"This time I ordered only soups through the app for the Rapid Pick-Up Service! Usually when I order sandwiches with our soups I notice sometimes our sandwich is either wrong or it just looks not appealing at all. Sometimes when I order a Caesar salad a lot of the times my lettuce is brown. It's really hit or miss. 

The reason why I'm giving this review a 5 is because even though it was just soups they did have everything in the bag that I ordered. Also we arrived there about 10 minutes after our estimated time and our soups were still very warm when we got home. It definitely was rapid pick up!"}
{"text":"I have mixed reviews on this location. Sometimes they are great and sometimes they drop the ball. I always order my sandwich with no tomatoes and when I lift the bread there are tomato seeds. I am not sure if some of these sandwiches come premade and they just pick it off or they just mess up EVERY single time. I am also confused on the sandwich size whole or half. Sometimes when I order a whole I get 2 sandwiches and sometimes when I order a half I get a whole sandwich. Shouldn't a whole be 1 and a half be 1/2? Whenever I ask a question they seem annoyed so we try to now order on the kiosk. They also dont seem to read the special instructions, my husband wants every sandwich grilled and they never do it. We will still go and hopefully one day my sandwich will not have tomato seeds on it."}
{"text":"TOP SHELF SERVICE--21 century style

Pros: GREAT Ux using the app and paying through itunes....kudos to you Mr. Panera for valuing my precious time and letting me skip the lines from the 20th century.

Food was prepared as expected and on-time, walked into the store, grabbed my food and started eating....all within a 1 minute period. Good-bye waste of my time lunch crowd....hello convenience. 

Nice job with embracing the customer experience and honoring the most precious resource...time."}
{"text":"Turkey sandwich was fresh, colorful, and healthy came with a side of \"Curley Hair\". Needless to say I won't go back until hair nets are mandatory."}
{"text":"Got the bacon, egg, and cheese on a brioche bun. It was simple and tasty. The Vermont white cheddar is sharp and flavorful. Was considering trying one of the souffles but they only had four cheese left. Really good iced tea. No self-serve kiosks at this location."}
{"text":"This Panera Bread recently took over the former Paradise Bakery location. The dining room was remodeled and looks very nice, clean, and modern. There are several kiosks (not yet in operation) where customers will soon be able to order from. I ordered the Pick 2 with the Bacon Turkey Bravo on honey wheat (with no lettuce, tomato, or sauce) and chicken noodle soup. The cashier said we could get a pastry for 99 cents but we weren't interested. She also said they were out of dinner rolls and offered apples or chips. We went with the apples. The Apple Pay didn't seem to be working, nor did the card reader, so the cashier had to swipe my boyfriend's card. When we went to fill up our drinks, we saw they were also out of iced tea. Bummer.
Our food came out as we were scoping out the tables. I had to admit my half sandwich looked pretty sad, but it tasted good, even without mustard (since they only have fancy condiments). The soup was also good, very light and not salty. After we finished, my boyfriend ordered a small bowl of mac & cheese for us to share. It was pretty good. Reminiscent of Stouffer's White Cheddar Mac. Panera Bread is pricey for what you get, but I'm sure we'll be back to try out the little kiosks."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in delivery service.  I've ordered from them three times for the delivery.  The first time took almost a hour to arrive but the order was correct.  The last two times the delivery took1.5 hours to arrive only to receive cold food and missing items."}
{"text":"Today is Sunday 3/5/2017 i placed my order at 2:05pm, it currently 2:45pm and still haven't got my order! Really why don't you hire freaking employees this is some major bs! You guys really suck"}
{"text":"This Panera blocks Yelp! on their in-house WiFi - no joke, check it out yourself.  Pair this issue with the incessant parade of tweens and soccer moms on Saturdays plus a blitzkreig of post-mass zealots on Sundays and I really can't fathom a reason to patronize this location as opposed to the rest.  Sure the coffee is good and the A/C is on full, but save for that you're better off at Boca Park or driving down to Fort Apache."}
{"text":"I miss Panera - coming from the midwest and currently calling Phoenix home we have \"Paradise Bakery\" but it just isn't the same; too much hip-hop on the stereo while Panera focuses on a more chill vibe.  Decent Coffee, comfortable seating, and friendly servers - yet another reason I'll be happy to be migrating north to Las Vegas very soon."}
{"text":"Free Wi-Fi, Unlimited Coffee Refills of surprisingly decent quality, a handful of individually bagged hot teas, and now with 3-4 varieties of iced tea plus iced coffee - sure I'm not going to pay what they charge for a sandwich I could make for 1/3 the price using better ingredients at home, but for beverages and simply killing time or getting some work done there aren't too many places I prefer."}
{"text":"I'm so torn on everything that is Nortera, but perhaps no place more than this.  Literally 5 minutes from my house there is a huge convenience factor to be taken into account, yet at the same time the fact that they don't stock Equal, my sweetner of choice, and limit their wi-fi to 30 minute bits during the day while Wildflower offers free wi-fi all day, Equal, and better coffee drives me nuts.  In the end I'll probably split my time between the two - using Paradise for study time and/or writing when wi-fi isn't necessary only.  Nice spot.  Good servers.  It just isn't Wildflower."}
{"text":"Odd in layout with an absolute lack of electrical outlets this is possibly the worst Panera in the Valley - all of the others varying in quality from good to excellent.  Apparently doubling as playground for children with irresponsible parents visiting the nearby mall it was almost intolerable to spend more than thirty minutes here and with a laggy internet further confounding the experience I'll just as soon head on over to the Eastern location when visiting the southeast from now on."}

Once a dining staple, a quiet location in Northwest Ohio providing bottomless Coffee one of the primary drivers of a caffeine addiction unlikely to ever wane, Panera Bread has remained a place to relax and browse the internet as I've moved West through Phoenix and onto Las Vegas, a lackluster recent visit to Kneaders making me wonder just how the current baked goods at the Quick-causal mainstay compare.

Having at this point not eaten a bite at the restaurant in nearly nine years, but none-the-less memorizing their greetings and selections by way of the friendly clerks and longtime General Manager at the Bakery-Café just down the street, it was for an abbreviated Saturday Breakfast that parking was located during the Seasonal Art Walk and briefly perusing a selection of crafts that made me long for days back in the Midwest it was with far more deliberation that the freshly stocked shelves of Panera were investigated, a total of nine items ringing in at just over $20 and consumed, in parts, over the course of six hours traveling around town.

Laid out in a more open format than other Panera Bread stores in town, the high ceilings and divided sections plus an outdoor patio helpful for relocating in case of loud children, over-aggressive Air Conditioning or the Red Hat crowd, it was with items both boxed and plated that seating was found at a small banquet with one of the sparsely located electrical outlets, a soundtrack ranging from ChVrches to Tame Impala and TV on the Radio as the internet creeped along, Boca Park inexplicably having not yet upgraded to industry standard WiFi Speeds as of yet.

Focusing recently on \"going clean,\" an amusing phrase considering both my job and hobbies, a look at Panera's recent lineup includes several Autumnal Flavors looking to capitalize on \"Limited Time Only\" and \"Back by Popular Demand\" shenanigans, first bites of a 'Cinnamon Crunch' Snickerdoodle showing the soft Cookie to be no different than any other recipe, though the homogeneity from edge-to-edge made it generally underwhelming, the \"Gluten Conscious\" Monster and Triple Chocolate versions far more interesting as the first was punched up with everything from Nuts and Fruit to Chocolate with the latter particularly impressive by way of its chewiness and textural variance.

Knowing better than to take a chance on laminated options, the 'dough' pre-frozen and from a bag as witnessed at locations with a more open kitchen, Scones at Panera eat much more like the American dessert pastry than their crumbly British counterparts, the experience made even more 'Merica by the addition of over-the-top sweet toppings, the Wild Blueberry version eating much like a Blueberry Muffin elsewhere while others might as well be served as Cake slices, though the seasonal Caramel Apple Thumbprint really is quite delicious comforting when warmed up and eaten in the proper context.

Completely underwhelmed by the \"Cobblestone,\" a lumpy sort of Brioche Muffin that seems to play on concepts of Monkey Bread and Fritters without properly executing on either, the Pumpkin Muffie comes off strangely dry considering the typical moisture content of its supposed constituents, the Apple Crunch Muffin a far better overall experience with small bits of Streusel mixed into the batter along with a whole lot of Cinnamon and dehydrated Apple Chips.

TWO AND A HALF STARS:  Generally a nice place to study and browse the internet, free Coffee refills and a wide variety of sweeteners plus creams available, Panera Bread is nonetheless 'food for the masses' sold in a slightly prettier package, the current \"Clean\" campaign just window dressing for to justify high prices as calorie counts and taste of most items are no different than what one might find at any number of other chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I love the food. But the employees don't seem to realize that the tables need to be cleaned and dirty dishes need to be cleared. nobody wants to eat surrounded by dirty dishes. sadly because of this ongoing problem I have stopped eating at any Panera restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the Sesame Chicken Salad today for lunch.  It is a very good salad and was very fresh.  It also rates very good on the nutrition scale.  Highly recommend.  Service was very good and the restaurant was very clean.   Good place to have lunch!"}
{"text":"Great location, needs more outlets to cater to the work, college crowd there and the music should be turned down but besides that it is nice. Please turn down the greatest folk hits of 2005. PLEASE"}
{"text":"Thankfully Surprise has now gotten their own Panera which happened to be the old Paradise Bakery (sorry, no free cookies anymore). 
The parking lot has, sadly, remained the same - a bit small, convoluted in some areas, and right for larger vehicles (-1). 
Space indoors hasn't changed because it was formerly, as I mentioned, Paradise before.  The ordering area appears smaller though, so when entering, one has to usually ask for a couple excuses to get through the throngs of folks who can't wait to place their orders (-1). 
Staff are friendly and sociable with the usual smiles and warm welcomes.  
Orders are accurate when ordering in person or via online.
Overall, very happy they're in town versus traveling all the way to Avondale!"}
{"text":"As a fan of Panera from back on the East coast, I'm really happy they've moved into the West Valley!
Thankfully there's one now located at the food court in the Arrowhead Town Center mall.
The staff were pleasant, profession, clean, welcoming, answered any questions, and even asked if we wanted a description of the menu items we ordered which they've never done before when we were back on the East coast.
Menu can be well seen on the well, and well lit.
The surrounding area was clean including the order counter tops.
No lines and two cashiers taking orders at the same time made things go smoothly.
Food as usual was good, filling, tasty, fresh, and hot!
They only lost a star because we asked for one of our orders without the accompanying salt and pepper but it tasted as if it did. (-1)"}
{"text":"Got the turkey cranberry mostarda & autumn squash soup combo. I can see where the sandwich could have been great, but it was super-dry , so I opened the sandwich & lifted the turkey, I had 3 1/2 cranberries & little else but some juice that absorbed into the bread, other side the herbed cheese spread was almost as non-existent! Soup was great, just sweeter than I would expect.    
Would have been nice if they told me or had on signs no refills on the expensive but tastey green iced tea, I would have asked them to NOT fill it to the top w ICE so that I had like 4 drinks out of it before it was all gone! What a disappointment! Never been there before & not sure if I will go back for anything other than the soups."}
{"text":"This one always out of bagels, if you want any breakfast item must come when they open."}
{"text":"Not the same as Paradise bakery ! 2nd time I have felt sick after eating! The white cheddar steak sandwich looked like a frozen sandwich you would get from the freezer section. The steak was like something in a can of soup. The soup came out luke warm. Anyone notice how all the food making is hidden now where as paradise used to be all freshly made right in front of you! After this 9$ waste I was sick for several hours. Yuck !"}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying I used to come to this location all the time when it was Paradise Bakery for the classic Turkey-Cranberry sandwich and a cup of broccoli cheddar soup. Just recently it's become Panera and I've dealt with the menu changes-like taking away the classic turkey cranberry sandwich (they do offer a flatbread that's the same concept)and atmosphere changes. Which the atmosphere is fabulous now! Quick and comfortable! But after today- I don't know if I'll be back. The soup was tasty as always but the turkey cranberry flat bread is a joke...3 thin slices of turkey, very few cranberries and it looked like someone slapped it together with no care."}
{"text":"Their menu is very limited when you are going for gluten free. You can either have a salad, one or 2 soups, and oh, another salad.  Basically you must like you're veggies order to eat here.

My favorite is the Fuji Apple salad, every thing is gf on that, so no subs are needed.  Their creamy tomato soup with out croutons is very good, I can eat that all day (and gain ten pounds while doing it for it is very high in calories).  Also if you are there on a day they have black bean that is also a gluten free soup.

If you are looking for sandwiches, Jason's deli is the place to go even though they just use udi's bread, but still it's a start.  One day I would like to see Panera to offer gf bread even if it is store bought."}
{"text":"Had the turkey avocado blt and summer corn chowder and they were delicious!  The girl, Hannah, who took our orders was very nice and helpful. Great supper.! We will be back here soon."}
{"text":"Start of a Wednesday morning on the Ohio turnpike we stopped in for breakfast here.  2 of the 3 breakfast items that I asked for at 0900 they did not have.  I ended up getting something that I normally wouldn't get and was not happy with it and I feel like I just wasted my money.

They need better management running at this location."}
{"text":"Panera. So standard. Pretty fast and reliable. We seek out Paneras when we're on road trips because I can't stand other fast-food-fare. This was no exception. We attended a wedding outside of Cincinatti and on our 8+ hour drive back to Rochester, NY we called our order in to this Panera and they had it ready to go. We stopped by, got our food, and got right back on the road. Good service.  Food was good (standard, as expected!) although I didn't love the way they cut the avocado for my sandwich. At home they slice the avocado thin and put it in layers on my sandwich. Here they had more big chunks which slipped out of the sandwich and were generally just harder to eat."}
{"text":"Went in for a nice lunch with the kids... this place is kept so cold it was very uncomfortable! My three year old just complained the whole entire time. Not enjoyable. Also high prices. Door not that good. Will not be back. Sigh."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a pastry/bread shop, then I guess this is the one to go to in the area.

However I've had better."}
{"text":"Tried the cinnamon crunch bagel, super tasty and crunchy! Reminded me of Einstein's bagels, but better. The staff was friendly as well!  My coffee was a little too much on the sweet side, but nothing to cause a fuss over. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Still disappointed in the service here. I went to go pick up an order before closing and the doors were locked at 8:57, even though Panera doesn't close until 9. If people were not leaving Panera and opening the door for me on the way out, I might have been cheated out of my meal. Once I got in, my meal was not on the Rapid Pickup shelf even though I ordered my meal for an 8:50 pickup. I had to go to the desk, where they had to find my meal behind the counter before giving it to me.

Despicable service. I wish there was another Panera so I wouldn't have to go to this one."}
{"text":"Go to Sprouts for a good sandwich/soup not here


I understand 'healthy' food is known to be expensive but I don't know why we keep getting fooled....a sandwich at Sprouts is half the price and way bigger with more flavor"}
{"text":"Thank you to the employee(forgot to ask name )who saw my trying to carry a to go bag and coffee while walking on crutches and offered to get the door and carry my things to my car. Several people just walked right on by me but she stopped what she was doing and ran over. Great employee and person to be so kind to the guests. I am at Panera about 3-4 times a week for breakfast on the go before work. Their breakfast souffle is so good. Flakey crust with eggs and 4 cheeses and 410 calories??..how is that even possible (a must try). You can't beat the free bevy when you order at the kiosk. Yummy healthy and fast."}
{"text":"It kind of freaked me out to be able to order an egg white sandwich with fresh avocado at a rest stop off the turnpike in Ohio. Did Ohio recently join the European Union or something? The egg fit nicely in my bagel and was a perfect circle (my favorite band) and the spinach was sautéed and seasoned nicely. No but seriously, it tasted good! The staff was very friendly and they gave me a little square vibrator to tell me when my sandwich was ready. The free wifi is strong enough that you could (hypothetically) watch internet porn while you enjoy your breakfast."}
{"text":"Terrible, horrible service. They couldn't have gotten it more wrong if they tried. I think they've been open now for several weeks.... C'mon guys get it together. I called ahead on the phone. It rang at least 30 times before a meek girl answered. I was driving from Glendale over to the Metro Center and it took the entire drive for her to take the order. By the time I parked my car at the restaurant and walked in, the order still hadn't even been put in. I give them partial credit for trying, as they requested my order to be done on the fly. However, when it came out, it came with an apple. I never ordered an apple. When I asked the gentleman why I was given one, he simply replied, \"Well you either get an apple, a bag of chips, or a roll. And it appears they ordered you an apple.\" Ohhh kayyyy, whatever, at this point I was late. However, I had also ordered a cookie. I had to ask and point out 3x that it was not in the bag before he looked for himself and realized it actually was not there, walked me over the counter, and handed me one. I also had to ask about my drink which was also not given to me. As if this was bad enough, when I got to my destination and opened my bag, I discovered I had been given a cold turkey sandwich instead of the warm turkey panini that I ordered. The food was expensive but fairly good provided you can get it ordered timely and correctly.   Anyone want an apple?"}
{"text":"I work fairly close to Panera and at first, I was excited to be so nearby, but after all the mediocre experiences and the last nail in the coffin, I won't be returning here.
I've always felt that the customer service here has been sub-par to the service I have received at most other Panera locations. Most associates have either seemed bored or snarky. But I can overlook this most times as long as I receive tasty food and drinks at a timely fashion.
This certainly did not happen on Valentines day, when I decided to use the very last bit of money I had to treat myself and get a Cappuccino. I had thought about stopping off at the McDonalds near my house, but I dislike Mickey Ds and wanted to use my money on something that I would enjoy.
When I walked in.....there was one cashier and many many customers. And about 5 employees scrambling around behind the cashier to get pastries for people (strange logic).
After waiting patiently for my turn for 10 minutes, I ordered a cappuccino with some sugar free vanilla syrup from a guy who acted a little short with me. Then I waited another 5 minutes for my drink and when the guy handed me my drink, I knew immediately that something was wrong because the cup had no weight to it.
I looked inside, stirred around trying to find espresso, but the cup was PURE FOAM.
I wasted almost $5 on a cup of milk foam. At this time, I was needing to hurry and get to work, so I tried to fix it and put some coffee in my cup, but all of the coffees were out except for the hazelnut. I didn't want the hazelnut, but there was no choice.
And that's it. I will never be back again. 

It pains me to say this, but I probably would have received a better drink (or at least a full one) and better customer service at Mc Donalds."}
{"text":"Panera has excellent soup & sandwich combos.  They are very tasty and fast for lunch.

I used to work in that area, so I would get a box of bagels for my team members once in a while.  They include the bagel spread like strawberry or plain, which is really good.

Great for lunch!

{"text":"I usually love Panera. The only reason I am giving this location 2 stars instead of 1 is because I have been there before and it wasn't quite as bad the other times, but they really screwed up my birthday lunch.
I go there for the hazelnut coffee. There was no Splenda. Ok. Used Equate. I couldn't find any half and half. The people working there were super nice, but at that point, my food had arrived and my precious time with my grandma was being wasted while I stood waiting on half and half. 
To make things worse, I have several invisible disabilities. I don't look like I suffer from a really bad back (whatever that looks like) or that a neurological disorder makes my neck twist and turn to the right. But standing there, waiting, made me start sweating with pain. Fortunately my mom took over for me. I didn't bring any pain medication with me. 
But, it would be better if they could put out a sign if they are out of something, so I don't have to walk back and forth, looking for it, asking for it, and waiting for someone to look for it, plus please leave milk or half and half out. Come on.
I was almost crying in pain from how long I had to stand there, which put a damper on my whole lunch, which was already sad, since it was the first since my grandfather died a few weeks ago.
Panera can't know what their customers are going through, but I shouldn't have had to load up my wheelchair or all of my braces, assuming that they would be doing a poor job, either. I ended up cutting my birthday lunch short due to pain."}
{"text":"I ate the food because I was hungry but if you order the veggie sandwich you will get some cut up little pieces of cucumber, a leaf of lettuce and a slice of tasteless tomato... on some dry bread. 
I also didn't get an explanation by the front desk of how the combos work. I ended up paying a lot more that I should have for something that was not good at all. Just cause you order something with vegetables doesn't mean it has to be so bland!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to any Panera Bread location, having been to a Paradise Bakery (their previous name) only once before.  I came here for a late lunch with a friend who chose the place. Frankly I had never been interested in it because I'm not a big bread eater. But I tagged along.

My first impression is I was surprise how large the place is. They must get very busy at certain times. When we got there mid-afternoon on a weekday there were still a pretty good sized number of people.

The ordering counter takes a minute to figure out, obviously not a problem for return customers who seem to be what Panera Bread depends on. You can pre-order and when you arrive your meal is waiting for you in a little cubbyhole, or you can order from your phone as you're on the way, or you can order from a self-service electronic kiosk, or you can order from your table, the choices are amazing. We chose to do the traditional standing in line (actually there was no one else but us) because I had no idea what to expect on the menu.  The staff was awesome and patient with us while we decided. I like the general choice of menu items, although it is surprisingly limited for as large of a place there is, and if I had a craving for junk food I could tell right away I was in the wrong place.

Being late and only wanting a light lunch I ordered the small Green Goddess Cobb salad and a latte. I didn't expect much from the salad since it hardly cost more than a Big Mac meal. The food was brought to our table by a friendly server a few minutes later.

I was pleasantly surprised at the salad. First impression ... the pieces of chicken were HUGE, not that diced lunchmeat-looking stuff most restaurants use. There were more different types of greens in the salad than I could identify, along with a lot of fresh avocado, tomato wedges and, um, more other stuff I couldn't identify, but thankfully NO iceberg lettuce. I started thinking to myself that I don't eat at \"healthier\" restaurant as much as I should if I don't even know what this stuff is.  The salad was an absolute 5-stars.  I am not used to having the dressing put on the bottom of the bowl and at first I didn't know there was any but I found that I preferred it that way, it doesn't soak all over the other ingredients and mess up their taste.

Another thing that struck me is how many people were using the workstations and free wifi. Yes, workstations, not just people taking up dining table space. I know when I have had to go to most other restaurants to work for a while I always feel out of place and that I am hogging someone's table. Panera Bread obviously welcomes people to hang around and gives them space where they won't feel guilty.

As is typical I didn't read any other reviews for this chain (or this particular location) before writing my review so I would be surprised if anyone could find anything negative about it."}
{"text":"I usually hate reviewing national-scale chain restaurants, but this one is special. Not because it is actually special but because I've probably eaten lunch here over 300 times over 4.5 years. The food is OK, the service is OK, the people are OK. It's ridiculously crowded on a weekday lunch. It's pretty empty at all other times. It's convenient enough and passable. Still, I remember it fondly."}
{"text":"I love their bread, but this review is for their food in general. Their poppyseed dressing tastes like it uses a low calorie sweetener that is disgusting. Also the \"steak\" breakfast sandwich is roast beef not steak. Kinda gross and major disappointment. They have really good coffee and I totally go there but they need to work on the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"I love this place especially bc o like to count Calories and this place helps a lot. I have fallen in love with their strawberry poppyseed salad it's the best salad I've ever eaten. There soups are amazing my co worker always tells me and I've tried some sandwiches i am always happy and their bread is to die for. The prices are expensive so I can't come here as often as I'd like for lunch and my bf (the big eater) doesn't like it since you pay a lot for a little food as he says it. Also why I don't go as much as I'd like to"}
{"text":"casual, cozy place to catch up (when it's not too busy) over a cup of coffee or some food. been here a few times, with no complaints. wifi is a nice bonus too lol"}
{"text":"Panera sucks, but this Panera really sucks. 

Hair in my salad. Salad was lackluster to begin with. Co-worker told me he got a bit of plastic inside a sandwich a few days before - I don't know why I still went.

Very crowded weekday lunch (due to proximity to hospital and several office buildings, including my own) - very poor crowd management. Line was not directed, so meandered through the door instead of curving in the available space. Lots of shouting at the register from clerks and weird vibes at food pick-up spot. My order was misheard and incorrect. Tables not wiped down. Some kind of self-order station just said \"Coming soon...\" on all 4 of the screens, which is too bad because perhaps then orders would be accurate and there would be less shouting. Even my soda was flat and too syrup-y! 

Only plus is lunch for under $10. 

Also I found it very funny that they had cookies called \"Gluten Conscious\" - like are they gluten free or just low gluten or are they just aware of the fact that there is gluten??"}
{"text":"Crunch, that's the sound it made as I bit into a frozen piece of turkey. What?  I paid $9 bucks for a frozen turkey sandwich? 1st world problems. Cookies and treats looked pretty good, very similar to Paradise Bakery. If you took Paradise Bakery, remodeled it inside, kept the same food quality, I would have said not a big deal with the merger between Panera and Paradise. But this is a big deal...Frozen turkey sandwiches! Cookies would fix everything."}
{"text":"Visited last Friday morning for breakfast with my wife. Loved their Avocado egg white sandwich. Nice place to spent some quality time with loved ones!!!"}
{"text":"I am unsure why this location has such a bad rating.  I frequently use this location to order lunch for business meetings.  The online ordering process seems to be the best option as too many orders can create a problem for the person over the phone.  It usually takes at least 1 hour for orders of 12 people.  I use the Rapid Pick Up area but sometimes have to ask if my order is ready when I arrive and find it behind the counter.  I have ordered from here about 10 times and had errors in about 3 (missing a side or special requests not followed); nothing that keeps me from going back. I have noticed over the last year that the staff has become a lot friendlier and it appears they may have a new manager who seems to do a much better job of keeping things running smoothly.

Since I typically take my food to-go I can't speak on the cleanliness of the dining area but from what I can see the place looks clean.  I have noticed in the past that the restrooms could use some air freshener and tiding up, but other than that they're not horrible.

I give them 3 stars due to dissatisfaction with their rewards program and the few times I've had errors. This location isn't to blame for the rewards program, but I have had troubles redeeming free rewards and wish rewards didn't expire.

Their strawberry poppyseed salad is one of my favorite items and therefore I will continue to go back for more."}
{"text":"Customer service was okay, got our food pretty quickly but when we got to the table my friend looked at his food and it looked like they literally dropped the sandwich off the floor, soaked it in juice, and scraped it up with their primitive feet and served it.  When he brought it back, and asked them to remake it, the chef pulled his head out of his ars for long enough to ask \"what? U don't like it toasted?\" Obviously I do, because I asked for toasted, so I just said \"look at it!\" He took it back and after a very long time brought back what was still an arguably mediocre sandwich. I don't know what kind of ooga booga bs Panera is trying to pull but I.don't.like.it. If I could give 0/5 stars I would. The only fairly redeeming quality is the cashier's service."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the service is really slow and they aren't super friendly. I called in to place an order but the phone rang and rang snd rang. I tried a few minutes later and the same thing happened. And again. And again. When I got there, I placed my order and asked one of the employees if the number online was correct. He asked why and I told him. His response was, \"when we get busy like this, we can't answer the phone. There's only two of us taking orders. I don't know why the managers didn't answer in back.\" This was not even a busy time of day, not to mention, there were at least 10 people working. Then, to top it off, all I ordered was a bowl of soup and it took them more than ten minutes to put it in my bowl and have me on my way. Not the best service :/"}
{"text":"Ordered Rapid Pick up Online, a Cesar Salad, it had no croutons and half the chicken was dumped into the bag.... a pick 2 of green goddess salad (avocado missing) and French onion soup (no croutons or cheese included), a kids Pb&j oozing all over the place and placed on top of the hot soup..... and a kids ham and cheese sandwich that wasn't cut and looked like a toddler made it... I'm glad I checked the bag for silverware because there was none...  we usually really like Panera but will not be back to this location!!! They were not busy, there was 1 group at a table, and a gentleman waiting for his order, while the 2 employees who make the food stood there talking to each other..."}
{"text":"This Panera is inside the lobby area of a business building. I decided to hop on in this Monday while I was upstairs running an errand. I had a free birthday pastry so I went inside to get a cookie which I ate last night. I came here during the afternoon on my lunch break and it was around 1:30pm. Service was quick and easy. While at the counter, I was told that I had a free sandwhich on my account so I went back yesterday (14 November) to get a sandwich. 

I got the Chipotle Chicken Avocado Melt sandwich which is so tasty due to the avocado and flavour (chipotle mayo). The bread (focaccia) was soft and toasty on the edges. I did notice that the bottom on one piece of my bread was a bit soggy but that didn't affect anything. 

Overall, a delicious sandwich - YUM. Plus, it came with chips but I totally forgot to realize that I could have added an apple but I didn't mind the chips.

P.S. this sandwich is actually quite expensive ($9.19) which is why I was happy it was free...haha."}
{"text":"It was awful, I ordered a $4 cup of chai tea and they gave me a half a cup of tea! Not even halfway full. Much worse customer service than other locations in Charlotte. Like the low rent version lol"}
{"text":"The past four times I have ordered a grilled cheese with paying extra for extra cheese they have actually put less cheese than when ordering normal. Here I am paying extra and receiving less than original?!?! Not to mention their cookies are always stale."}
{"text":"I only ordered two items. One was broccoli cheddar soup.  When I got home, I realized that I had potato soup. When I called to speak to someone, the recorded message asked me to try again during less busy times.  I waited and tried again only to get a fast busy signal after listening to the choices.  I tried again, and pressed a different option, once again fast busy signal.  I live 20 minutes away, so I did not wish to return today. I was disappointed that I was unable to speak directly to anyone on the phone.       Finally able to get through.  They will make it right and give me a cookie for my trouble.  Thank you! I must admit that the wrong soup still tasted great!   I love Panera soups."}
{"text":"What can i say the best the best and the best, in pastrys an bagels, however you are in the USA same quality !

I like it"}
{"text":"Panera is always great ! Delicious Pastrys and Bagels and a nice place to breakfast in this Area"}
{"text":"I ordered an asiago roast beef sandwich and  was later told that they did not have asiago bread to make it. The whole point of ordering the asiago roast beef sandwich is the bread. I should have been told before I ordered. Won't be going to this place anymore!"}
{"text":"I've been to MANY Paneras - as I'm sure most people have.  I have been to this one a few times.  But today I am writing about a specific experience.

I placed an order yesterday over the phone for Panera Catering - a few dozen bagels, pastries, etc.  I spoke with Jayla (I could have spelled her name wrong) on the phone to place the order.  Jayla - was phenomenal. She worked the order out to even save us a couple bucks!  (every penny counts!)  We worked it out that I would pick it up at 7:30am.

This morning - I went in to pick it up at 7:30a.  The catering coordinator came, I paid, and then she was great enough to help me carry the order to my car.  I made sure to tell her how much I appreciated Jayla.  

I will go back to this panera - for personal and catering items.  I was in and out in under 5 minutes.  I know there will be times the wait will be longer - but that's ok.  Thank you for making my residents happy!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a bagel.. the location had NO cream cheese of any kind. What is a customer supposed to put on their bagel? Nothing else was offered. Poor ordering process.."}
{"text":"I love this Panera. I get delivery from them a lot and it is usually very quick to arrive, about 30 minutes after I place my order. The mobile app is really great for placing orders for delivery or for pick up. I highly recommend this Panera due to their great service!"}
{"text":"Love this place - for breakfast, lunch or casual dinner.

I almost always get the You-Pick-Two option. I can never decide on just one thing! Among my favorites: the Napa Chicken Salad sandwich, the Fuji Apple Chicken salad (yummy dried apples & gorgonzola!!), the Chicken & Wild Rice soup (creamy & wonderful. If you hit them on a day when they're serving it, absolutely, get it!) This past Friday night I tried their new fall sandwich - the Roasted Turkey Artichoke Panini. Holy smokes! Unbelievable. It tasted like fall - juicy turkey, the artichoke spread was cheesy and warm and the bread was toasted perfectly. A must-try.

Reasonably priced, the restaurant is always clean and bright, staff is friendly, good selection, service is quick."}
{"text":"For some reason there is an abundance of children at this place. I usually go to Henderson Panera but I didn't have time to wait in line. Some parent right now  is taking a pic to show the mess the kid is making bc he thinks it's cute. I had to wipe down my own table and seat. I gave it  3stars bc the salad I was craving was consistent at this location."}
{"text":"I like Panera bread but this one is a so so. I always get my fuji chicken salad in every Panera bread I go. All of the other use spring mix to make their fuji chicken salad except this one.. They just use regular salad and salad doesn't taste or look very fresh either. I was kind of excited to find there is a panera bread around us but I am disappointed after trying it. Don't know if we will be back again."}
{"text":"Man...used to love this Panera Bread when I lived in Charlotte previously. Unfortunately...the service/cleanliness has seen better days. Foods still good, but it seems like they've given up on this location.
Maybe it was a bad night (...and I know they're not really a \"dinner\" spot either)"}
{"text":"The menu leaves you desiring more. The service is awesome. Had a good experience and will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Execelent and nutritional quick bite , try the Greek salad ! Good price"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic the service was great!! I had a large to go order and Esther killed it with the service!! She had an unconventional solution to my order of drinks that was pretty large. All the food was right and the blood orange lemonade was perfect! Thanks everyone!! Highly recommend! Shout to Esther! Killin the game!!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Panera bread because they have delicious and nutritious food at reasonable price point especially their pick 2.  I have been this location couple times a month because of its location. The downside is parking can be a challenge but it's in the Boca Park shopping center so it's expected to be busy with suburbanites. Most times the food is good just service can be a bit slow on peak hours. But this location has one of most seating areas and large patio area and now they are open until 10pm on Mondays to Saturday's for nights when the family is too tired to cook."}
{"text":"Panera bread has to be the most inconsistent restaurant I have ever been to. I have posted two pictures of the strawberry poppyseed chicken salad. The first one looks delicious the second one looks like they could've used a smaller bowl. It did not even look appetizing."}
{"text":"I have been there several times and every time they mess up my order. The employees don't have good customer service, and it has taken up to 25mins to get my food even though they have been simple orders. I had to remind one of the girls that I was missing stuff from my order and she would only bring back one item and I would tell her again that I was still missing items, it was really annoying. I haven't been back, I would rather make the drive to go to the one on Flamingo and Paradise."}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars, how does Panera run out of bagels at 8am?!? No bagels= unhappy office."}
{"text":"We live down the street and order from here often, but they always seem to be out of one type of bread or another, how does a bakery, that makes bread, run out of bread.  That being said, service is always relativly quick, and being an iced tea fan I appreciate the selection."}
{"text":"Food, good as usual-but person pushing out orders struggled to get the orders correct and to the right people. Pleased that the manager recognized the problem and intervened
Just made for a lot of delays.."}
{"text":"Poor service, forgot items on our order and fingering of my food but initial response by manager was corrected so I'll give it 4 Stars for healthy quick food but 2 for initial service rounding out to a 3 Star rating."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches with very fresh ingredients - but it is a little on the pricey side. They started a new trend: two signature items for $9.19 without tax.

I've tried:
-Turkey Bacon Bravo: simple sandwich that comes with turkey, two slices of bacon, lettuce, tomato and...tomato basil bread(my favorite soup)!
-Napa Almond Chicken Sandwich Salad: a very refreshing and good combination that includes grapes in the sandwich too. Everything complimented each other very well.

Known for their broccoli cheddar soup so don't forget it! Their creamy tomato you can skip because it was just average for the price to buy it as an a la carte but perhaps not so bad if you wanted to change up your soups choice once in a while.

Booth seating available that can fit up to 4-6 comfortably and an average number of tables varying from 2-4 people. Outdoor seating is available too with four tables and two chairs per one. This place gets packed with people, come check it out and you'll understand why a long line is normal when waiting to place your order."}
{"text":"Order rapid pickup from this location regularly and items are missing or meals are not made to order too often. Just ordered salad with chicken, avocado, and bacon. To go box had lettuce in it and nothing else. Manager used foul language when I complained. They did agree to deliver a replacement salad and it had NO chicken on it either and driver was rude to my wife!
They didn't even bother to check the order a second time. I'd skip this location."}
{"text":"Severely over priced for what you get. $4.20 for a PBJ sandwich? Really? Never coming again."}
{"text":"This place is always understaffed, cuts bagels unevenly, and seems very unfamiliar with how Panera's operate."}
{"text":"I love this location for my fix of cinnamon crunch bagels. Good service, location, and a evenly sliced cinnamon crunch bagel!"}
{"text":"I like Panera because the food is simply good and they have some great sandwich and salad options. Their pastries, though, always look much better than they taste. 

Their rewards really do pay off as I'm frequently getting free pastries, discounts on certain menu items, etc. The employees always fill me in on what rewards are available to me and when the expire. The customer service is excellent. On my most recent visit I ordered an apple as a side. When they brought the meal I asked for a knife to cut the apple, since my 11 month old can't bite into it. The employee did one better and brought me a sliced apple.

It can get a bit packed in here and the lines get long at times. They move quickly enough and their bread is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I really do enjoy my sandwiches here - sometimes it's just a lunch I crave.  The restaurant is clean, service is decent, and there are a lot of good sandwich options.  It's a little expensive though and if I'm going to pass it up it's usually because there are cheaper options.  

One thing I'm never thrilled with are the pastries.  Luckily, with my panera card, I  often score free pastries and don't normally buy them.  

Also, the panera card often rewards me with cash off a sandwich, free coffee, and other goodies.  And it's usually a surprise when I order and hand them my card so I feel like I've \"won\" something lol.  

I like sitting outdoors here on a nice day.  Easy meal to enjoy with friends and not feel TOO guilty about afterwards."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  Cost to portion size is high - not a good value at all.  1/2 a sandwich here would be a 1/4 of a sandwich elsewhere.   The chicken noodle soup was mostly broth and not anywhere worth $5.  My daughter likes the mac and cheese here or we'd most likely not be back."}
{"text":"Obviously, everything here tastes like Panera -- but slow service, dirty bathrooms and restaurant, and food that's often \"sold out,\" make this the last local Panera location on my list. I'd rather go to the Waterworks."}
{"text":"Excellent place little crowded but my main man zachery took care of my whole family great customer service will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of Panera but this is a pretty good location. Much better tasting than other locations in the area (ie. Cuyahoga Falls)."}
{"text":"Nice place to have a meeting or to study. There is M
usak in the background but it's not too loud. And unlike other Panera's it's not freezing cold."}
{"text":"Come here infrequently due to the high prices for mediocre food. A small cup of soup is $5.13. I find that overpriced for something that is frozen, but it satisfies the soup craving when stuck in the library. 

However, in November through my Panera rewards I had a free bagel everyday of the month. I will say their bagel quality is pretty good. They are huge and filling. I tried a variety from cinnamon crunch, pumpkin pie, asiago, blueberry, and everything, but my favorite is always sesame. Their plain cream cheese is also really creamy and delicious, but more expensive than the bagel. 

Their online ordering is great if you know when you will be popping in. Otherwise, there is usually a line."}
{"text":"Okay, this location does stink for driving/ parking and with the recent nearby construction it also stinks for walking.  Despite these shortcomings, it is near where I work, the staff here are friendly, and with the the MyPanera Program card I get a lot of free food.  

Seriously, the next time you visit a Panera ask for their MyPanera Program card.  I swear I always leave with like a grocery bag full of food!  Just signing up gets you a free dessert item (a $1.49 - $2.49 value) on your next visit.  So far I have received three free dessert items and a smoothie.  I would like to thank this location for informing me about the program that I knew nothing about until a visit here.    

My favorite thing at Panera is the 'You Pick Two'.  I get the Sierra Turkey
on Asiago Cheese Focaccia and the Fuji Apple Chicken salad with bread.  This combo will give me two meals, as the half sandwich is filling on its own.  Just remember, these Panera dishes while tasty and fresh can be very high in calories...don't trust me...check their site. 

Overall, while corporate, I do enjoy my Panera and especially love the MyPanera program.  Signup and I am sure you will too!"}
{"text":"Ah Panera, just because everything is (well looks) fresh does not mean it is healthy (low in fat & calories)...because it really is not. This visit, despite saying sans to the cheese and dressing on the sandwich, had my 'You Pick Two' meal (that included a half salad and chips) coming in at 520 cals and 27 fat. But it is darn tasty! 

Atmosphere - busy, messy (for 8:30PM??), friendly staff, LKN people trying to look cool using the free wifi, end of the day pastries sitting here and there. 

Service - Friendly and not annoyed...this is surprising as it was so close to the end of the night. 

Food - I love tasty, crusty, tough, soft centered bread and Panera will delivery for me on that front. Especially since the CLT lacks the number of local bakeries that I am accustomed too. I had the half Chicken Caesar sandwich (sans Caesar's) and a half Fuji Apple Chicken salad w/ a side of chips. Yes, I could have made this meal healthy by losing the chips...but I am healthy not crazy. As usual, this was all tasty and fresh tasting. I recommend the FAC salad. 

Overall/ Tip - Panera does have a cool feature on their website that lets you determine how many cals you are consuming that is very easy to use. It even lets you deselect items, on a sandwich for example, then instantly recals the new calorie total. 

So I guess even a big corporation like Panera/ The Saint Louis Bread Company understands that tasty food can sometimes be deceivingly fatty."}
{"text":"Fenix was very rude to us at the checkout. Continually ignored questions and was sassy when she did answer."}
{"text":"Well, dang apparently I keep ordering off the healthy, save the whales menu or something cause these portions are small. I went through the drive through and ordered \"soup\" and it  was good but came into store this visit and got disappointed. Now if I weighed 114 lbs or I was working on my yoga I would be perfectly happy. But no, I'm not a yoga instructor and need adult sized portions for 200 plus XL size appetite  but this \"combo\" is on a size too small for even some children. So, don't think getting a \"combo\" with \"half\" of anything is a decent size meal. It's a \"healthy, save the whales, great for yoga students\" size meal. I was ready to attack an animal when I left, in other words, I was still hungry. Luckily, there was a burger joint near by. If you come here make sure to get \"full\" portions! Can't give them many more stars because the grill cheese and soup was smaller than my hand.  atmosphere inside is nice but only two tables had a power plug close by for phones and laptops. Good place for coffee but asking for water will get you a cup perfect for only kindergartners so get a coffee or drink instead.
The biggest flaw is when you order your food, you pay right there and they ask you on the pin pad if you would leave a tip. That's a huge flaw, first I can't predict how service will be ahead of time and more importantly, after receiving my meal there was ZERO service and had to empty my own dishes. Maybe that's why they ask for a tip first because with zero service , I wouldn't leave one. Really there are many better sandwich shops that offer more food, a better value and way better service than this place. I won't return and don't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go on what I like to call a \"lazy day.\"  You can grab your food, hang out on the internet, and really just take your time.  It is where I go when I want to grab something healthy, but delightful.  

They could be a little more giving on their portions of salad dressing and mix it a little better.  It seems inconsistent, leaning toward the lighter side.  Also, it gets packed during lunch and walking space is tight.  It can get overwhelming from time to time, but that's the price you have to pay to get good eats sometimes."}
{"text":"Being a big fan of Panera Bread in the US, I was excited to find one so close to home.  Several quick visits though quickly showed me that this location is nothing like the US locations that I've come to value through my travels.  

A few things that could've been improved on during my most recent visit:
1. the menu board lists the food options without giving a description of what's in the meal.  It would be great to know that \"Thai Salad\" contains cashews and edamame, for example.  In the US, there are paper menus stacked everywhere so that you can see a full ingredient listing.  The most recent US location I visited in fact had a self serve kiosk that listed each item and allowed customization of the standard items.  Brilliant!  Not having the ingredients listed meant that a lot of people were just standing around the order desk trying to figure out what the different foods were.  There was a lot of confusion.

2. the employee at the order desk got the order wrong.  I know this is person specific, but had she repeated the Italian sandwich order, we would've quickly realized that this was not the same as the THAI chicken flatbread that was ordered.  She also confirmed that my chips were baked (Just like in the US..) whereas they were in fact the fried kettle chips.  Big difference.  I assume the employees are asked this quite often as the person I complained to said that \"no, only the US locations have this\".  

Once again, had there been a display or a kiosk to see the order, this could've been avoided.  

On the positive side, the food came out quickly and tasted fine (including the incorrect sandwich) but the experience was slightly diminished by the other points. 

The US Panera system works very well from a service and selection standpoint.  One of their main attractions is that the food is good and the system is easy to follow.  Why not try to duplicate that for the Canadian market? I will definitely continue to go to Panera in the US but not likely in Canada."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a bite while I had a babysitter.  There was not much of a line and I ordered my food fairly quick. The gentlemen taking orders were very nice and thorough. I sat at a two-top for some quiet dining and received my food within a minute of sitting down. 

When I was finished there was a line at the garbage and the manager came up to everyone in line and took all of our dirty plates! I have a lot of respect for manager stepping in and doing the \"dirty work\" to make sure their guests have a great experience. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"30/10/14

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!! in the Night... The soup is cool and i wait up 25 minutes.. i see the soup in the counter ready waiting, i decide go and pick the food but the soup is cool and the sandwich hard.
I request talk to manager, and he say sorry..  but i don't know about people in the kitchen... OMG 
finally after 26 minutes they replace the soup and sandwich but the order is wrong. Again after 20 minutes he finally bring the right food... finally"}
{"text":"As far as Panera's go this is a great location! I ordered the ancient grains and arugula with chicken and my friend had the you-pick-two French onion soup and spicy Thai salad with chicken. Both of us were very happy with our food, the short wait, and the pleasant atmosphere. Really, the only complaint I have is because of the coffee. 

I drank two cups of hot coffee while there. The first was just Hazelnut coffee with cream - it was a little too weak but I didn't mind. My second cup I split half Dark Roast and half Hazelnut coffee to make it a little stronger. The Hazelnut coffee was fresh, but I noticed some grounds on the top of my cup - as I drank more I realized that the entire bottom of my cup was filled with grounds. My friend had the dark roast coffee and it was fine. Maybe I just got the unfortunate first cup of the brewed coffee?"}
{"text":"So I know Panera is overpriced, most people can agree on that. BUT as far as Panera Breads go, this is a great location. I looove that there is a parking lot, and plenty of seating, clean bathrooms, and friendly service. 

The coffee was better than other locations I have visited, and the cashier gave me an extra scone for free because he said the first one he grabbed was a  bit small. Totally made my day!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I did not have a very good experience at this Panera. For starters, I had to wait close to 30 minutes to receive my salad (not horrible given the busy location) While waiting I overheard a staff member say to another \"If people get mad I just tell them sorry and that they have to wait. I'm not sure what else they want me to do\". You might want to get your employees to have those types of conversations elsewhere and not within earshot of customers. It's about taking ownership for the business you work for. During my waiting I also saw several people bring orders back that had issues, missing things, dirty utensils ect. On top of all of this, my salad had no dressing and I did not have time to go back. When I called they said they would put me in the customer log to get a free salad and the gentleman was nice on the phone but I unfortunately will not be back. I really thought this would be a quick option for me near my work :("}
{"text":"I had never been to Panera Bread but we were visiting Phoenix so we stopped. We took long to order since we had never been, the lady at the register was very patient. The food was good! I was full but not stuffed! I only gave it 4 stars because we had very little choice of tables. There were a lot of dirty u cleaned tables. 

We had the Bacon Turkey Bravo and it was okay! The hubby had the Chicken Chipotle Panini and it was so delish! The lemonade was really good too!"}
{"text":"This location is one of my favorite in Las Vegas area as it is always clean and open feeling, as well you get to Wall the Village Walk area and shop conveniently. 

This location is clean with a friendly staff. 

It has limitations though. Panera, as a quality leader in the fast-casual dining realm, still has not masterfully integrated more vegetarian and vegan options that make sense. Sure we can have a salad, but soups and sandwiches are far from favorable at this point. 

Also, make sure to get in early on the weekends because once 10-11am mark has been crossed, you can expect very limited bagel and pastry options - and the coffee becomes sub-par since the rotation of fresh coffees are being changed out less. 

All in all great for family, quick lunch  and even a last minute dinner option and I recommend this location over most!"}
{"text":"I have officially waited too long for someone to pour soup into a cup and hand it to me."}
{"text":"Revisited Panera yesturday..soup as usual was great. Yummy baget. Only find it strange they serve margerine, no butter to be found. Have to bring my own on next visit."}
{"text":"Wooow! What a disappointment... paying $5 for a breakfast croissant and opening the box and find this... brunt bacon harder than a rock, bread was cold and egg as cold, the whole sandwich was cold that the cheese didn't even melt as you can see from the pictures. They took forever to get the drive thru order for the people in front of me and they only had 2 drinks! And they took for ever to get mine as well... Do they charge for the hair too? Guys you can do better."}
{"text":"I love sandwich & soup combos. Panera's food never lets me down. Such good priced meals for filling food! Love all the options and all the seasonal salads/soups/sandwiches. Only thing about this location is sometimes you don't get the friendliest staff working the registers. On the bright side you only speak to them for 5 minutes or less. It's a hit or miss for me on the service the cashiers give me. Wish their was a closer location to centennial hills. The parking here is sort of small and usually very crowded and busy. But it's worth it for Panera."}
{"text":"I discovered Panera when in Kansas City and was glad to see it come to Phoenix. I like the new fast lane kiosk, service was good, and the decor is nice. Unfortunately they have changed the menu to include a kids section. They seem to be catering now to the \"inappropriate for kids\" crowd. What would have been a nice breakfast was interrupted by crying babies, and children playing in the dining room. Maybe Panera can go all out and get a clown and playground."}
{"text":"What's with the hate? I love Panera Bread! Especially this location. Everyone is always so friendly and the food is consistently delicious. It's also the perfect spot to grab lunch after my classes at UNLV!

Hubby and I do the You Pick Two, both with the Half BBQ Chicken Salad. We just can't get enough! I've tried other salads, which have been good, but this is definitely our go-to. Hubby's other pick is usually their Turkey Chili which is really thick and tasty! I hate when chili is too watery so this one has the perfect consistency.

Since I'm the more adventurous one, I've had almost every soup they offer. My favorites have been Cream of Chicken & Wild Rice, Cheddar Broccoli and Baked Potato Soup (hold the bacon!). If I'm being honest, they're all tasty. It's just a matter of preference. Some of their soups are only available on certain days so check ahead of time if you're craving a specific one.

Please don't leave without getting chocolate chip cookies! They're baked fresh daily so they're soft and yummy. The Passion Papaya Green Tea is good too. I've come to the conclusion that it's probably more water (and sugar) than green tea, but we're not complaining lol.

You'll see us here again once the Fall semester begins. :)"}
{"text":"This location didn't even pop up on Yelp until recently. It is pretty big inside compared to other locations. Very well placed for easy in and out with ample parking. 

We ordered five separate meals with soups and sides to go. Food was as good as any other Panera and came out perfectly as ordered with a minimal wait. Pastries were fresh and delicious. We had a fresh baked cookie while we waited and definitely did not regret that choice. 

Overall, a very nice addition to the Westlake food options!"}
{"text":"Allison, you are so right.  I've boycotted that restaurant because they are ALWAYS out of everything.  They need to get it together.  It's good though, if they actually have what you want, which for me is rarely."}
{"text":"I have gone to Panera for YEARS and usually they are top notch and reliable....This location, however, is not.  Before I put my review, let me say that I have had to contact corporate TWICE to try and see any type of resolve...Let's hope this second time will actually work...
 I have gone to the same Panera for the past three days and apparently they do not feel the need to pay attention to detail to those in the drive thru.  The first two days, I ordered exactly a large black iced tea with a cinnamon roll heated up.  The first day, they heated up and placed it inside the bag without a box, completely unsanitary.  The second day, they said \"we don't heat up cinnamon rolls here.\" I had to in fact inform the employee that they did heat cinnamon rolls, however, yet again, my cinnamon roll was thrown into a bag with my napkins and such thrown on top.  The third day took the cake.  I decided to spell it out for them because clearly they did not understand that a cinnamon, like any other pastry, goes in a box. So, I ordered a large black iced tea with a cinnamon roll heated up in a box.  And what did I get? A cinnamon roll, in a bag, not heated up.  The customer service here is beyond poor.  Upper management needs to step in because clearly the management at the store is not providing proper training."}
{"text":"Not to be mean but I guess you have to be of a certain personality to like the food here.  The stuff looks great on the big lit up overhead sign but the real thing looks like something the pulled out of a sealed package and threw in the microwave.  The grill lines look they were painted on the sandwich.  The so called sausage was like a puffy white color and not much flavor.  I guess it's the image of Panera as being healthy.  If your a steak eating caramelized carnivore.  Don't go here.  The sausage egg McMuffin is far better."}
{"text":"Coffee , creamers, great food. Not always quick, but good.

Bagels are good and fresh daily.  Not everyone loves it hete, but it's good enough for me. 

Tables clean, fireplace is on, and it's warm in the carpeted area. It's pretty cold in the tiled area and I avoid that area. Restrooms are usually clean and there is 3 stalls in the Ladies room.

Many returns to this place as its close to work."}
{"text":"My family has always been fans of Panera Bread.  We frequented their Seal Beach, CA location often as we enjoyed the food and their dedication to customer service.  Unfortunately this Panera location was lacking in most aspects.

Even finding this 'Panera' (The facade says Paradise Bakery) was frustrating.  I'm not sure if this was a Paradise Bakery that was bought out by Panera, or if this is some kind of one-off rebranding, but even Panera's website says that this is a Panera Bread location.  The signs told us otherwise.

Once inside, it was obvious that none of the workers wanted to be there.  Bored, slack-faced, hanging one-armed off of the registers.  They seemed to all be of younger age, and it was clear that they had better things they wanted to be doing.

The food was what we had come to expect.  My Frontega Chicken panini was actually well assembled and tasted fresh.  Not much to complain about there.

However, the inside of the restaurant needs a deep cleaning in the worst way.  Everything is sticky, dingy, and unvacuumed.  The girl bussing the tables sullied about looking miserable, and used the same nasty rag on all of the tables.  There was a noticeable funk smell that permeated after she had wiped down our eating area.  Definitely not an appetizing aroma.

We are disheartened that this is our closest Panera location.  All it would take is a little better management to ensure better cleaning practices and perkier associates.  For now though, we'll probably think twice and drive further to a well-run Paneradise."}
{"text":"I mean, it's panera. You can't really go wrong but it's definitely nothing to write home about. They have quality food and it's a good place to study. This one doesn't always have clean tables, but I think it's cause they get busy. My one critic for real is that they don't have any almond or soy milk for the coffee out, only skim and half and half, but it is what it is."}
{"text":"So upset...  I went on my lunch break with my boyfriend.  First thing I smelled was feces and urine due to the amount of homeless in there.  Took them 5 minutes to do an order.  Then we had to wait 30 freaking minutes for food!!!  Half a sandwhich half a salad , a sandwich,  and chips and it was $27.00 will definitely not go back."}
{"text":"Well its Paneta bread nice to work for this company so I know they do fresh ingredients  so you're always going to get something fresh something made with good ingredients and not bad at all the places always updates always clean I don't really have any complaints about this Panera bread you know it's artists and somewhat so commercial franchise and commercial can't go wrong withit"}
{"text":"Panera bread, yay!

One of my favorite places I go to for a quick lunch, breakfast, & something to fill my cravings of a little comfort food.  

I have tried a variety of their selections and my favorites is the bacon & ham panini, with caesar salad, & and their tasty baguette.
Also other favorites are: cheesy mac & cheese, their hot chocolate, broccoli cheddar soup,  of course their free internet service that they have! 

Reasonable prices & the people who work that are AMAZING."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times and it has been usually okay. 

The service when they take my order has either been great or rude.  Sometimes, they are looking somewhere else or looking at people coming into the restaurant. This girl was not making any eye-contact with me and I can't even hear anything she is saying.  She seemed so distracted at everything else. 

The food is usually served pretty quickly.  I always order the chipotle chicken and i always like it cause they taste the same every Panera location I go to.  My sister-in-law ordered one of the pastas and it tasted so horrible! The pasta was so chewy and it tasted like those middle-school lunches in the cafeteria.  It was just awful. 
The baguette is usually a miss for me. Sometimes its soft and taste like it just came out of the oven and most of the time it is hard and tasted old. Also, I ordered chicken caesar salad that was probably the only thing that tasted good and fresh. 

Anyways, panera has a variety of selections you can choose from and there is something for everyone.  This location is really big compared to other panera locations in las vegas."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with its sandwich which was too small and had no traits. Considering its price, it was a mistake to order sandwiches in this place. I had to order additional soup to fill my stomach. 

Despite that fiasco, I went there again more than a few times because it is good place to study or read a book. It is so quiet and provides a free refill service.  

There is one more good thing. Iced lemon green tea!! It is so fresh and cool. I bet it can provide better freshness rather than coke. I strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"They have a variety of specialty bagels. I got the cranberry walnut bagel with cream cheese and it was delicious. The workers are nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Being from the US, I was expecting a similar feel when I stepped in.  The initial cookie cutter look was there and that is where it ended.  The bagels are \"OK\" and soup was warm, not hot.  The coffee selection seemed a little light (where's the dark roast?) With the usual selection of teas.  I miss the couches that surround the fireplace and smell of baked goodness.  One more issue was that the power outlets were placed in not so acessable areas with the WiFi dropping every few minutes.  I will give this place another try later on and see if I was here on an off day."}
{"text":"i've been to plenty panera breads. none have ever disappointed. i have no real complaint about this one either, except that it was ridiculously crowded, but the service was still good and so was the food. that's really all i can say, except if you've never been to a panera at all, you need to check one out. my favorite dishes are the black been soup, broccoli cheese soup, chicken caesar sandwich, and mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Have been a frequent customer of this location and though the food is the same as other locations, the cleanliness and actions of the staff are definitely lacking.  Used the online ordering today and rapid pickup feature, but when I arrive to grab my order - it sat alone on a dirty shelf and the side of bread laying on top of the bag not covered/wrapped.  To me this is a tad bit unsanitary and a lazy move by the staff. #Getwiththeprogram"}
{"text":"Earlier today I ordered the chicken cobb salad and they forgot the bacon and avocado on it..wtf!!  While I was eating it I thought to myself I should take this shit back to the counter lol, but I didn't!  I've been here many times and they have made very few mistakes on orders.  I've eaten at a lot of PB locations, but mostly this one because it's convenient for me.  I love the pick two deals and the variety of options you can choose.  My favorite menu item would be the chicken poppyseed salad, but it's only available during summer months.  PB offers a cozy dining ambience with a fireplace and plenty of seating.  I often see people having business meetings, interviews, students studying and such.  They offer free wifi inside.  Be sure to sign up for the My Panera card if you're a frequent customer...

12/7/17 - Today's service was at an all time slow and low today!  I love this PB location, but today I was left very dissatisfied!  Waiting much longer than usual at the pick-up counter, you can hear nothing but teenager staff goofing off.  I ordered a double Pick 2, one for eat in and one to go.  Neither order had a baguette which I had to ask them for.  I ordered two Bacon Turkey Bravo sandwiches that were served without bacon.  Let's just say that the staff today deserved no \"bravo\" for their poor performance!  To make it worse, I tipped the cafe team via the new option on the kiosk when you pay for your order.  I asked for a butter knife and receive one of the dirtiest pieces of silverware ever.  I literally had to scrape it clean with my thumb nail before running it under water at the beverage counter and polishing it with a napkin.  WTF PB...get it together!!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent service... overpriced for the quality of service they're offering. I hope the company repairs this location... it's very bad at times."}
{"text":"A truly terrible Panera--badly understaffed. Orders are wrong a significant amount of the time. On the bright side, you may not GET any order, because I've stood at the registers for 5+ minutes being ignored, with nobody taking and orders at all. On multiple occasions. Twice I've just given up and left.

Also they crank the A/C way too cold. Pro tip: save some money on the A/C and spend it to hire someone for the registers!

If you want the stale, overpriced, small portions that only Panera can deliver, go to a Panera that has enough staff."}
{"text":"The egg white, Medierranean was out of this world, the Coffee and the friendly smiles were awsome.  I went not really expecting any out of the norm and \"WHAM\"  had a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"I just got the Lemon Chicken Orzo soup and it was really awful. There was barely anything in it and the broth tasted like water. The one piece of chicken I got in it was so gross looking I had to take it out and throw away (it was attached to a string of purple weirdness and fat) so disappointed."}
{"text":"This my local Panera Bread.  It's a nice place to get a soup, salad, and a sandwich.   They now deliver to my office but the last few times I have ordered, I have ate in the store.

They have changed their mode of operation.  It's more service driven.  You still order from the counter (or phone app or computer stations.).  But the food is delivered to your table and the servers ask if they can bring anything else for you.  I have had my friend ask for extra napkins and the staff has returned to our table with the napkins.  Tipping at the table is not done but you can drop a tip off at the front counter.  it's not expected but if the servers are doing a good job, I don't mind at all.

If you sign up for the rewards program, you can be up for discounts and free items.  I have been going frequently in November so I get a coupon for a free pick two.  In October, I got a free bagel every time I ordered.  So it is worth signing up for that free rewards program."}
{"text":"I tend to avoid writing reviews for places like Panera Bread.  I mean I always figured there wouldn't be many who would benefit from a review unless I had some key intel that made it completely unsuitable.   This afternoon at this location, a man approached me while I was awaiting my takeout order and asked \"what's their specialty here?\"   After I stammered something about \"Bread, soups, sandwiches and salads\" it dawned on me:  perhaps there is a small fragment of the population who COULD benefit from my review!   Here goes:

I'm all about the \"hidden menu\".   I use quotes because the hidden menu is about as hidden as escort services here in Las Vegas.  There is literally a spot on the main menu behind the cashiers that has the Chicken Hummus bowl with a blurb \"from the hidden menu!\", and the website has a link that says \"Hidden Menu\" on it.   I'm not sure the word hidden means what panera thinks it means.   So on the hidden menu tend to be low carb, low calorie options.   They're all delicious!   So much so that I find myself ordering from them at least twice a week.   

My favorite is the Turkey Mediterranean Salad.  You get your salad pre-requisites of lettuce, tomato and onion, and then some baby spinach, nice olives, peppers, and the star of the show:  delicious \"antibiotic free\" turkey.  You also get a side of bread, an apple, or chips.  I go with the apple when I'm wanting to be healthy.   The best part of the salad is its only 300 calories!  Lohan and Richie circa-Skeletwin days would approve.  

The Chicken Mediterranean salad is also fantastic, though I have no idea what is \"mediterranean\" about it.  It has lettuce, spinach, chicken, eggs, and bacon.  Haven't exactly seen anything like that at Stephanos.   Anyway as far as taste this one is probably my favorite, but it comes in at a whopping 400 calories so I save it for special occasions, like Thursdays.

The steak lettuce wraps off the same menu are really tasty and a crazy low 210 calories.  It's basically just some lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, and steak with some great pesto sauce.   It's hard to believe how much flavor you get for only 210 calories.   I do find myself feeling more hungry hours after I eat this one as compared to the others so I don't order it too often.  

For me, you can't really go wrong at Panera from a flavor level.  I've also done several of their sandwiches and soups and have generally been pleased each time.  It's not exactly groundbreaking, but simply good and consistent food."}
{"text":"I tend to be extremely long-winded with my reviews, but I was so tempted to just write \"Yup, it's a Panera Bread alright\" and leave it at that.   What more really needs to be said here?   This is a true test of my nature.

So yeah, it's pretty much what you've come to love or loathe about any Panera Bread.  Nothing on the menu is particularly ground-breaking, but if you like soups, salads, sandwiches and pastries you'll probably be able to find something to enjoy here.  Lately I've been a big fan of their Soba Noodle Broth Bowl with chicken.  I've always enjoyed the flavor of Panera's \"Organic, Cage Free, Antibiotic Free, 'we swear this chicken lived a long and fruitful life'\" Chicken, and I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of the buckwheat soba noodles as well.   On other days where I don't feel so soupy, I'll do a pick two with the greek salad and turkey chili.   I don't even really find either of these to stand out to be honest, but they're relatively \"healthy\", run of the mill versions of these dishes that satisfy my hunger and just get the day going again.  What an endorsement, I know.   But that's sort of what you're expecting when you come to Panera isn't it?  I don't prepare my tastebuds for a shocking flavor explosion when I step through the door, it's just going through the motions of 'Eat, Sleep, Go to work, Repeat', but it works.   Maybe that's just because I skip the bakery section.

For food I was leaning on just giving a 3 star review, but Panera's somewhat recent roll out of their Rapid Pickup option is just so phenomenal that I bumped it up a star.  You can order online (and it's very well designed and intuitive), and drive to your local Panera where you order is just waiting for you on a shelf system.  Now I don't want to think about the implications of my food order sitting on a shelf for minutes before I arrive in this mad, mad world we live in, so I block those out and just grab it and go.   Minus human interaction, plus one star.

In conclusion I'd like to rant a bit about Panera's incessant removal of my favorite items from their menu.   I loved the Spinach Power salad.   Gone.   I loved the entire Power salad \"hidden\" menu.   Gone.   I know the broth bowl is next.   I just know it."}
{"text":"How can you mess up a grilled cheese??? They did...had to re-grill it because the cheese was not melted at all. Hopefully it's a one time experience. We like this place, but was a miss this time"}
{"text":"This place is grossly under staffed and the one cashier they do have has one speed - reverse!  Never seen anything like it.  They have self service kiosks so they can keep minimal staff, but that doesn't work when buying packages baked goods."}
{"text":"I love eating the food. But more often from the comfort of my own home. I often order online and come in to grab my food. It's quick easy and the food is 4 stars. The customer service is 2. So I'm meeting in the middle with 3 stars. I am so glad that they have started to deliver. I wouldn't go in to eat there ever. But an order to go let's you skip the dirty restaurant and the mild mannered employees."}
{"text":"Sign outside - and everywhere online - said this location closed at 9 but their doors were locked at 8:20. Mehhhhhh."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the first time since it opened. I thought the start up issues were probably solved by now.....nope!
I arrived around 3pm and ordered the steak and cheese.
It was obvious the employees could care less about anything.
Since the table area was hardly occupied, 
I sat at a booth. Shocker, salt and pepper on the table, sticky spots, and disgusting.
I moved to another table and it was fine.
My sandwich arrived and I knew this would be the last time I would ever go to a Panera anywhere.....done!
The massive all bun had one thin slice of meat and half a slice of cheese. Tons of onions and horseradish. Ridiculous.
I took one bite and immediately left the restaurant it was so bad.
I walked 30 feet to Dickies BBQ."}
{"text":"Fast and quick service, make sure to sign up for the points card if you are thinking of becoming/currently are a regular. 

Big fan of their French onion soup. I ordered the soup in a cup size with a baguette on the side. The soup itself was really good. What I didn't know was that there was cheese nearly at the bottom of the cup which made the soup taste 10x better. For sure I will come back to try their other soups."}
{"text":"The restaurant was really dirty on the floor and the tables when we arrived today at 4:30 p.m.  I am disappointed.  I really love the food at Panera."}
{"text":"Great place for group studies, chatting, coffee with refill and  they have great breakfast items. You can't go wrong with free wifi and lots of power outlets with plenty of comfy seats :)"}
{"text":"Food was good. The staff was uniformed when I asked them about their portions. So I ended up ordering something different than what I expected. The dinning room was a little dirty. Overall I will not be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Great customer services ! Little $$ came an hour before close Lita helped me choose a great meal with pastries and Daniel made a delicious broccoli cheese soup and tuna sandwich ! Thanks !"}
{"text":"Definitely better than the other Panera we went to.. I don't know, but here it just feels awkward trying to order, and how the place flows... but all in all, the food was better this time around. Prompt service and very polite staff. 

Wife loves the hazelnut coffee here.. They have a nice selection of teas as well. 

Asiago sandwich/bagel is pretty good.. will be back"}
{"text":"OK, Yelp'rs... This place,,, does lack customer service,, but the food was actually ok, with the exception of bagels tasting a couple days old..

Daughter Cookie, was super delicious,
Wife loved her cheese danish... 

The ham n swiss souffle's were very tiny.. for 4+ bucks.. so i went with the Asiago Bacon sandwich.. The sandwich was also pretty small, egg over cooked with that ugly gray lining around the yoke, but overall the asiago popped and the sandwich was edible.. 

Now... Will I be Back ? ... on a road trip out of town and see a Panera, possibly stop in for bfast... Drive to our local one,,, ehhh not unless the wife tells me to.. best of luck !!"}
{"text":"I bought my broccoli cream 2 times a week, but today my cream was water and tasteless."}
{"text":"Just went there and experienced terrible customer service. 11AM so breakfast sandwiches no longer available. Ok... no problem. We saw quiches available for sale in the pastry section. We ordered two of those and the woman at the register said that those are expired and they're no longer for sale. They are a business and they have a product in the window... therefore, it is available for sale. If it is not available for sale after 11, as we are now ordering at 11:06 AM, then the product should have been removed from sight. We ended up leaving because of how bad the customer service was. The other lady taking orders right next to her started throwing the quiches away in the car garbage right in front of us! I would have been happy to buy them and give them to the homeless!
I purposefully do not buy pastries here because they seem old and stale and they sell them all day long! I have ordered the quiches and they are delicious 2 days later! What a ridiculous policy!
Very disappointed in this location."}
{"text":"Panera is always one of my favorite places. I enjoy their bakery items, the atmosphere, and their Mac and cheese. They would improve on their coffee.. I don't know of what it is but it lacks something. And they should consider halal options!"}
{"text":"I was going over to my mom's and a few other people were going to be over, so I thought I'd bring some snacks and stopped by Panera. They have a bakery section on one side of the eatery. I got a box of assorted pasteries. Their scones and bearclaw were a huge hit with everyone! It is slightly overpriced, but it doesn't hurt once in a while, and I find its nicer to take over to someone's house than Tim Horton's donuts! It will be enjoyed by all and fulfill all sugary necessities."}
{"text":"This Panera ROCKS!!! Spencer was lightning quick with my to go order today.  I was amazed.  Whether I order online, and pick it up, dine in, or get it to go, this location never fails.  Thank you all for working so hard to make Panera a great experience each time."}
{"text":"Panera ROCKS!  Love the BBQ chicken salad with a sprouted grain roll, please.  Today, they had a special.  Buy a $50 gift card, and get a $10 gift card free...SCORE!  Quality food, friendly people, and GREAT service.  Awesome!"}
{"text":"When did it become a burden for customers to be there ???! What happened to politeness ? 

Not one smile or thank you when I ordered my soup to go from either girls working there . I get you may hate your job or having a bad day but like the rest of us who deal with customers you hide it and treat the folks with respect. Sure makes it uncomfortable to stop in anymore ."}
{"text":"Better sandwiches to be had at Barrique's for about the same price and the service is just not good.  They have good, expensive, bread for sale but find a local bakery.  Just not worth it."}
{"text":"Was not super impressed with this store.  Called on the way over and pressed the button to put in my to-go order of a bagel/cream cheese box.  When I spoke with the gal who picked up, it was clear I was going to have to be forceful in order for her to let me; she just kept telling me that I could order it when I got in, so I just hung up.  We got there and it was not busy at all - we were the only ones in line.  But the gal at the register did not know what this bagel box was.  We kept repeating the name off the menu and she still was confused and had to call over a manager.  Took abut 10 minutes to finally put the box together and then we were told that they ran out of the regular-size cream cheese tubs although it was only 7:30am.

We also ordered a breakfast sandwich that we ate while we waited for the bagel box.  But when we got it, it wasn't cut in half, which they usually are at any type of breakfast place.  When I asked if I could get the sandwich cut in half, I was told that they couldn't accept it back over the counter and given a blank stare.  I was then offered to use their knife myself, which negates any germ-related reason for not just grabbing my sandwich and cutting it for me.

Overall just a super poor experience - we'll go elsewhere for the rest of the mornings we need group bagels while we are here."}
{"text":"they did not have bread bowls & my friend ordered mac n cheese and they did not tell her they until she was getting water and she ordered a soup instead."}
{"text":"I only got the coffee (hazelnut) and had no complaints, however beware this location only has chocolate chip cookies, no muffin tops. The coffee was hot and what was needed for the drive. The seats at this restaurant and will separate it from all the others in the plaza.The seats and with Kristen so even eating somewhere else you should take your food and eat it at Panera."}
{"text":"I had panera breads in CA, so I was excited when they opened them here in AZ. I can not wait for there summer salad to come back with orange and strawberries. I wish they had a salad like that all year around. The apple salad is good, its not as good as the summer salad. great location, there service is quick and the food is good."}
{"text":"The food is ok... Good place to eat and get a little work done but that's pretty much it. I like the wifi. They're slow... I ordered my food at 2:40 it is now 3pm. Still no food and it's definitely not busy in here. The manager is ok she's a bit rude."}
{"text":"I have to say that I am a bit baffled by all the positive reviews written for Panera. Although It seems like people are mostly raving more about the staff and atmosphere as opposed to the food. I personally find the food to be bland and overpriced. 

Their signature deal is a soup and half sandwich for $7.99 ($9 with tax). The soup is soup and the sandwich is literally two slices of average quality deli meat in between very average bread and some mixed green leaves. Frankly, the food reminds me too much of hospital cafeteria food."}
{"text":"Why does Panera suggest you tip now? What extra service are they providing, exactly? The food is good, but it's expensive, definitely not fast and half the time they mess up my order (last time I came, they put the wrong salad dressing on, and when I pointed it out, they apologized but did not offer a voucher or anything). Then they ask if I want to tip them?! So annoying. No, I dont, but I'm sure others are tipping out of a sense of misplaced obligation to do so. I hope they remove this option from the checkout process soon."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, but the service is always really slow. They consistently have a lot of people in the back, but only one cashier, who also has to prepare bagels etc. so it takes forever to get your order in."}
{"text":"The cookies were great. The service was abysmal. Took 20 minutes in line to receive 2 chocolate chip cookies.  An elderly customer spent $35 ordering multiple items. Took another 5 minutes to process his free cookie. One cashier with a long line. Then when she places my order she goes on to process another customer's order,  another big order.  No apologies.  I expect better service."}
{"text":"Sigh. I don't know why but for some reason Panera's have just been letting me down lately. Their bagels are still pretty good but their lunch/dinner menu just doesn't wow me anymore. It's hard to pinpoint the exact cause but it's just not as good as it used to be. 

They've changed up some of the sandwich combinations.. even the old reliable tuna salad has been put on a different kind of bread and seems to shrink in size every time I get it. Employees are usually nice it just seems like everyone's on autopilot. 

Even had a few items from the bakery and I can't say I would order again. The brownie was pretty hard and the cookies aren't as good as I remember either! I used to crave panera sweets but now I'm indifferent. 

Still come here if you want a break from fast food. Just manage your expectations."}
{"text":"Although I have been a little disappointed with panera chains as a whole recently, this spot is close to work and rapid pick up is unbeatable some days. 

Ironically, I see many reviews talking about orders made incorrectly or with missing items, but that's exactly what I wanted to praise this location for! I've had substations or additions to my lunch orders and recently they have been on point. Nothing is missing, it's ready on time, and the orders are correct. 

I usually avoid eating inside this location since it gets crazy at lunch time, but it's interior is similar to most newer paneras, food is delivered to your table, and it's usually pretty clean when I am I side. Staff had always been pleasant in my encounters with them. 

Either way, hopefully I don't eat my words.. but I would recommend rapid pick up here!"}
{"text":"I really love Panera :) Best spot for a first date or Sunday brunch with the girls. 

Favorites: Cinnamon bagels with butter, the soup bowls (try the broccoli/cheddar), the soufflés are also pretty incredible (I have had every type), brownie points for their house coffee and iced teas"}
{"text":"When I'm home during the week I do lunch take out here all the time. It's straight money every time. I order on the self serve kiosks and avoid the long lines. Out of 50 visits I've never been surprised which is good when you're in a hurry.

If you don't get there by 11:30am the parking lot will be packed. There is a free parking garage to the left of the place and a short walk. You can cruise the parking lot for five minutes and a spot will open if you're not the waking type."}
{"text":"It's not very difficult to provide a quality experience for a customer, especially at a near fast food dining restaurant. That being said, let me tell you why I rated Panera aka St. Louis Bread Co, a 1 star.

I ordered a pick 2 soup and sandwich which shouldn't take too long, but it took me a little over 10 minutes which is ridiculous for a place where mostly everything is pre-made. My broccoli cheddar soup was good but my avocado chicken sandwich was 10% chicken and 90% avocado. 

During my time of waiting to get my food I noticed some things that deemed the 1 star rating. First, right after I ordered I noticed there was an employee who was doing cashier, barista, and answering phones, WHILE BOTH MANAGERS WERE ON THEIR PHONES. I felt bad for the employee because the managers were literally not helping the circulation of the restaurant. Just standing around on their phones laughing about who know what, while their employees struggle with the lunch rush.

Also, I asked for a bread bowl with my pick 2 but got a slice of bread instead of the bowl. Seriously? The bread bowl is one of the only reasons I give any attention to this establishment and they couldn't even provide me with what I asked.

Lastly, I forgot one of the main reasons why I don't come in and it's because a Pick 2 and a Drink was almost $14.. half a soup that I give a modest 6/10 and half a sandwich I give a 3/10 because of the disproportionate amount of avocado.. $14 is way too much for this mediocre meal."}
{"text":"Ooohhhh Panera! I just wish we had one in Utah then life would be great!

Short and sweet here, It just comes down to a fabulous meal salad, soup, and sandwich style. You can tell from the menu and descriptions what you will or won't like. I recommend the soup and grilled cheese!

Love this place!"}
{"text":"I really like Panera Bread. I like their coffee, I like their pastries, I like their sandwiches, I like the atmosphere and the staff is always professional, lively and courteous. It does however epitomize homogenization of chains which, in my opinion, always lowers the value of most dining/drinking/unique experiences.

I like it better than it's predecessor, The Atlanta Bread Company which all but disappeared in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Lately the service has been less than desirable. We had to go get our food sitting near the kitchen past two visits. After 20 minutes of sitting our hot meal was cold...and three coffee pots were empty. 
Not sure what's going on...seems very different."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to eat after a long weekend of eating BBQ so I decided to stop at Panera bread to get one of theirs summer salads. It was like I hit the jackpot the place was not busy like it usually was and I ordered the avocado cobb salad. The salad was delicious and big enough to fill my belly. comes with feta cheese, hard boiled eggs, bacon, romaine lettuce and I believe cobb dressing. 

They have a good  different supply of ice tea flavors that most places do not carry. I was also impressed with the manager who was attentive to the customers even though it was not busy. I mean he could have just sat back and chilled but he was helpful and involved with the customer. Thanks for a great visit I will return"}
{"text":"This is the worst Panera I've ever been to. I got a french onion soup on a bread bowl. I would expect the The bread bowl would be filled in soup. However, there's not even a cup of soup in that bread bowl (see picture). It's not even worth it. I've gotten the same item in other Panera location and I got more food. Despite my dissatisfaction with the food, the place is clean and the staff are very nice."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I like Panera Bread but it seems like the food doesn't taste as good the more I eat there. The soups are fantastic and the bread is pretty good too. I'm not a fan of the sandwiches. They have too much condiments on them and the bread gets soggy quickly. I do have to say that the customer service is great, and they always have patience with people who can't make up their minds."}
{"text":"The staff is incompetent and knows nothing about the menu and how the food is prepared. My friend specifically asked if there was cheese in the sandwich. All of the people said no and one of them looked in some book that describes the food. Then, when delivered to the table, you guessed it-cheese on the sandwich. Bread was delicious, oatmeal good, and latte nice."}
{"text":"I love this Panera. Location is very convenient to my house and it's in the middle of a huge shopping plaza. I've always had a great experience and everyone has been very friendly. Food is always fresh and the place always looks very clean. The patio is my favorite. Huge thumbs up! 

I disagree with some comments below about the drive thru and I think it's ridiculous to compare it to Chick-fil-a or McDonald's drive thru. In the end of the day - you're getting a fresh product that is made right there in front of you vs waiting 30 seconds to get a frozen old sandwich that has been sitting in the fridge for days. If all you care is how cheap and fast your meal is then you really are better off at Chick-Fil-A or McDonald's. Quality food takes a little longer to make.

I'm a huge Panera fan, and the Arboretum Panera is by far my favorite. They also deliver too!!! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite locations. The staff is great, and I often visit this location to pick up pastries or boxed lunches for company events. Easy way to rack up those rewards! Can get pretty busy between 7AM and 9AM, and of course during the lunch hour, so I would suggest using the app for rapid pick-up during these times."}
{"text":"If your use to Paradise bakery, you will be sadly disappointed.  Got the turkey apple cheddar, and the flavors were muted. Apple was barely notable, cheddar was white and lacked the snap of cheddar, and the cranberry was minimal in the bread. Also got the turkey avocado BLT, which had a piece of bacon, and thinly sliced avocado. As a whole, it to lacked any substantial flavor."}
{"text":"I can't believe they charge me $12.02 for a cup of soup , half of a sandwich,  not even really a half of a sandwich  , an apple and a bottle of water. I could havewent to the store and got this for a third of the price I am truly disappointed. Also they didn't have any crackers for my soup ......who would offer you soup without crackers?????  I have no clue.... apparently Panera Bread does.....when you  trying to eat healthy here are places lije panera bread ready to rippppp you off.   Check out my picture!!"}
{"text":"I love Panera. It is a go to place for me for pick two combinations with salads, sandwiches and soups.  Today I tried the Cobb Salad and it was very good.  There was a perfect balance of ingredients and everything was fresh- including the ripe avocado and crisp bacon.  Every time I try something new I am pleased."}
{"text":"Meh....
We ordered: shrimp sandwich (which I requested on wheat and did not get), a turkey sandwich and a child's PB&J. I got soup with mine, French Onion....it was pretty good but the sandwich was not (shrimp). No taste, bland.....
Kids sandwich was laughable. So small and messy when we got it. The yogurt is in a tube....so much for organic. The yogurt didn't look right either (my son didn't eat it).  The apple I got looked so old....dirty.  They should wash it or serve apple slices. I expected better quality of food. I probably would go back but I wouldn't run back there, especially for the prices.  Restaurant itself is nice and comfortable....but food quality is not so good IMO."}
{"text":"We dined at this Panera Bread this past weekend, first time ordering an Italian sandwich.  When I received my order, it appeared that there was no meat on the sandwich, so I opened it up and a very small amount of meat on a small portion of the roll (no exaggeration you could not see it).  I took the sandwich back up asking the Manager if this was correct - and she responded \"yes.\"  We were very surprised - we've never seen anything like this.  Naturally we will not be returning anytime soon!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Panera Bread twice in my life. The first time I'd only been in the United States a week. I ordered a chicken noodle soup, which was so bad I couldn't finish it. I never went back to any Panera till five years later. Last time my wife didn't feel like cooking and so on our way home we saw the Panera Bread sign and pulled in. I ordered a Mediterranean chicken flatbread sandwich. I couldn't get past the first bite. It was dry, looked unappetizing and... there was hardly any chicken in it. Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"The food is good, but don't try to call in a lunch order- they are too busy to take an order for lunch at lunch time! I guess I will stop trying to eat lunch at this location. I have never had this problem at any other Panera..."}
{"text":"I wanna like this place SO bad. I simply can not ever leave this place with out some level of frustration.  I will say for salads, and cookies this is the place to go they're amazing.  The sandwiches are so inconsistent.  Countless times I have gotten such mediocre sandwiches that leave you disappointed and feeling ripped off for the prices they hit you with.  This place is popular and they do have good food, however the customer service, and sandwiches need some better consistency."}
{"text":"Went here to grab a late lunch, but instead I got some inedible food. I ordered the steak and cheese panini and a Caesar salad. Both of which should've been fairly simple items. Instead, my sandwich was burnt and made wrong! I asked for no onions and to have Gouda cheese and Swiss cheese. My panini was burnt, 2 pieces of Swiss cheese and had a ton of onions on it! Now to the horrible salad! My Caesar salad had wilted brown romaine lettuce, little to no Parmesan cheese, 3 croutons and one serving of dressing that was so small it didn't even cover a quarter of my salad! I called back to complain and no one answered the phone. Horrible job Panera! I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite to eat and was expecting the typical Panera experience.  Which normally we really enjoy.  Unfortunately, when we walked into the restaurant, a strong odor, like sewer gas, not sure what it was overcame us.  I went to order, but then decided not to stay as the smell was so strong.  The lady at the register said the smell usually happens when it rains and it was because of the vacant building next door.  Sorry for the unfortunate review, but it really needs to be addressed I would hope."}
{"text":"After our last experience which was bad, We had to meet someone at Panera today. My wife purchased a carrot cake cupcake for me. It was at least a day old.  Very dry. And frosting was ridiculous sweet.  But OLD."}
{"text":"I love going here with the family, the option for fruit as a side instead of chips is refreshing, i'm tired of fast food burgers and fries all the time. I also love that whenever you get a combo they will throw in any bakery item for .99! Their cookies are HUGE and delish, brownies..mmm...yes please! enough said

As for the food I always get the half sandwich and half salad combo, their classic salad is SO DELICIOUS I can never get enough. I always get a different sandwich when I go and their Smokehouse Turkey Panini is very good but I was more impressed with the Smoked Turkey Breast Sandwich & the Napa Almond Chicken Salad sandwich. The only soup we have tried is the french onion and its always yummy."}
{"text":"I mean, it's Panera can you even go wrong here? 

This location tends to get busy during lunch because it's near so many companies but they still have pretty quick service. I love this location because they have a drive thru which is great for when I'm on a quick lunch break."}
{"text":"Panera Bread sucks! Wish I could leave a negative star rating (-1) when I found out Panera had bought out Paradise Bakery, I sighed. When I went and experienced the service, I groaned. When I had the food, I cried. Wow! Way to ruin a thriving brand with a mediocre substitution.

I have bought and sold businesses myself. Rule #1: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Why would you replace an assembly line concept that keeps customers moving thru the line, allowing them to see their order being made and make them a part of the experience, with 2 poorly handled registers, no sight of food or preparation and an under-performing staff?
Rule #2: Don't lessen the product because you want to improve margins/profits. Create a better \"experience\" and the price won't matter. You think people choose Chipotle over Taco Bell on price? No way! The experience, the sights, the smells, the freshness, the service concept. They all matter. 
Rule #3: If you don't understand the culture of the customers you're acquiring, don't buy the company. Ever wonder why Starbucks beat the pants off Coffee Plantation? They understood and tapped into the \"culture\" of coffee drinkers. They understood that 'where' you buy the coffee is perhaps more important than the coffee you buy. It's a destination. It's an experience. And, they made it a 'status'. Would you rather have a Dutch Bros. coffee mug or a Starbucks mug? Enough said. 
I hate Panera Bread with their watery soups, limp and lifeless salads and sandwiches that leave you crying \"Where's the beef?\" They would have done a far sight better keeping the name and concept the same. Then having competition marketing between the two, driving customers back and forth and, improving each product along the way. Panera Bread missed the boat here. I mean really missed it. And now, they've lost another loyal customer. Here's the finger to you Panera. Way to go!"}
{"text":"My first thought after dining here was \"Jesus, I hope Panera doesn't screw up existing Paradise stores this badly.\"

There's no place to wait in line. The dining room is cramped. The kids working here don't give a damn. And, as another reviewer mentioned, the patio is--for reasons inconceivable to anyone who's even visited Arizona--on the west side of the building. I get that Ocotillo is full of cold-blooded elderly people, but even my nonagenarian iceberg-veined grandfather declared it \"too damn hot to sit in the sun.\"

The food was... edible. Soups and salads were actually pretty decent. The sandwiches, most of which are lifted wholesale from Paradise's menu, were not good, with weird, tough, chewy bread, less meat than Paradise, and absolutely no care in their prep. (Including chunks of skin still on my avocado. Appetizing!) Tea was stale, frozen drinks were half-melted before being delivered, service was slow, and nothing came out together.

Drive the extra five minutes to Paradise at Germann & Gilbert instead. Better food, better service, and you get a free cookie. Or if you really don't mind a drive, the Paradise at Ray & Price is head and shoulders above both."}
{"text":"Love panera. I'm a sucker for a good Caesar salad, and I think theirs is pretty good. I usually get the pick 2 so the salad and usually some type of panini or flatbread. The flatbreads are good but need a lot more toppings."}
{"text":"I was excited to have a drive thru Panera near our home, especially for on the go healthy breakfast options. However, while the food is terrific, the staff here is dreadfully slow. On a recent, non-busy visit through the drive-through for two breakfast sandwiches and a coffee, the wait took nearly 10 minutes. Everyone behind the window looked like they were moving in slow motion. I'll choose Chick fil a from now on for anything I need relatively quickly."}
{"text":"This place has been open for only a month and it's already going downhill. The dining areas are dirty and they were out of everything. Seems like some new management is needed."}
{"text":"Came in today to grab a snack and the tables were filthy as well as the floor. This place needs a good cleaning!!"}
{"text":"Just used the \"fast order\" and took over 15 minutes to get two hot chocolates. When we asked the manager where the second one was he gave us total attitude. Rude!!!!! Visit another panera!"}
{"text":"I swear, Paradise Bakery is the most socially unconscious \"healthy\" dining choice. When I was Vegan, this salad toting place didn't have any viable options for me. Unless I wanted an exorbitant price for leafy greens. EVEN EVERY BREAD CHOICE HAS DAIRY. What kind of bakery are you, if you can't make a decent bread with the basic ingredients? 

Now that I'm a vegetarian, the choices are just as sparse. All of the entrée salads come with meat. If you don't want the meat, you still have to pay for it. I refuse, on principal.  

Staff was great, it's Paradise/Panera that sucks. This will be my last time coming here."}
{"text":"This has always been one of my favorite restaurants until this morning when there were flying bugs in my oatmeal.

They also have a 'volunteer' working there. She does not wear a uniform but she serves food and cleans tables. I wonder if she has a good handlers card???"}
{"text":"Cashier was very helpful when I told her it was my first time eating at Panera. She thoroughly explained menu items and recommended the best fit for me. My food took about 5 minutes maximum to arrive although the restaurant was crowded. My chipotle sandwich tasted fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I don't think I'm imagining this, however, I've been a fan of Panera for years and I've noticed the sandwiches are getting smaller and they're getting pretty stingy with what goes in it. I just bought a $9 \"Premium Signature Sandwich\" and it's literally about the size of my iPhone, and just twice as thick! I'll post a picture for those who think I'm exaggerating. Aside from the now overpriced food, the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was pleasant. 

This was the first time I actually thought my girlfriend got a better deal with her salad than I did with my sandwich."}
{"text":"Filthy and rude. Employees put dirty silverware on my tray (so dirty that I'm not even sure if it had been washed). When I called it to the attention of the manager, she was dismissive and \"re-made\" my food, which was up 45 seconds later and probably the EXACT same food. So much for the \"we'll get your order right the first time or we'll remake it and offer you a bakery item\". The booths were also dirty. Definitely will not be returning. Any guesses what was on the knife they gave me? Peanut butter, vomit, snot? I don't know either."}
{"text":"Perfectly fine one of these Paneras, but it provides a contrast between the ordering system prevalent where I live and the one here. This is basically wait at the counter (the buzzer system seems superfluous) while at my \"home\" Panera, you get a beeper that you put on your table and they bring your order out to you when it's ready. The latter makes for a far more relaxing experience, even if they still expect you to bus yourselves (that's a one-S bus, as in clear your dishes away). And, I think that's worth a difference of a star."}
{"text":"I ve ate here a few times food is always prepared correctly staff is very nice and coffee is always fresh which is important for me being a coffee drinker . Their pastrys are off the map! The inside is very clean and orderly with condiments always stocked. Kudos Panera !!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here on the way to shopping. Unfortunately, the staff is very unfriendly. The food was sloppily prepared. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Go to my favorite panera, get a sandwich . when I open it up to eat it the chicken is frozen and not cooked. I take it back to panera and when I tell the girl behind the counter she says \"it's the frontega right? I told them it wasn't done.\" Then while she takes the sandwich to replace it three other girl says \" I'm glad I've never tried the Panini's here. \" the manager walks up and says\" sorry , do you want a new sandwich? \" I say no they are already talking care of it. The girl brings me the bag i leave and when I open it up to eat it, it's the same sandwich but, Luke warm.... I am so disappointed.. Never going back there.."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot!!! The last time I stopped in for a quick lunch I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly, quick, efficient and accurate the staff all were. The cashier was very thorough with my order making sure that everything was to my liking. They give you a little table locator that tells the kitchen exactly were in the restaurant you are seated. When your food is ready everything is brought out to you. HOW COOL!! You can also place orders frim their iPad stations or from your phone. I will try out the Rapid Pickup next time :)"}
{"text":"Bad way to start the day..poor customer service..Megan needs to lose her attitude...her idea of offering above and beyond service lacks appeal when offered with a heavy sigh and nasty attitude. If I want to order from a kiosk, pick up my own drinks and food from a cooler, heat it in a microwave that is located BELOW the coffee counter about 8 inches above the floor (when we finally located it!), pay by sliding my card and bussing my own table. ..I'll eat at QT.  Panera should have stuck to \"bread and free WiFi \" and left Paradise Bakery alone..I'm sure that wasn't the part of the business that was losing money.  BYE BYE PANERA!! Wish it could be less than 1 star..so my star goes to Sarah and the nice cashier lady. They were the only star worthy parts of this experience"}
{"text":"I work near this restaurant and eat here on a regular basis.  

First the staff.  They are excellent.  There's a capable crew that is very competent and friendly.   The turn around time is outstanding.  I especially appreciate the professionalism of the main manager.  

I love the bagels as well as the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich during the breakfast shift.  

All of the sandwiches I've tried have been good, but most times I opt for the Italian.  I especially like the freshness of the bread. 

I highly recommend this restaurant and I'm grateful their within walking distance."}
{"text":"Please note this is the Panera site on Tryon Street in Charlotte, NC. 

I have eaten at more Paneras than I can count as well as using them for catering, being on the road in sales. It's healthy, fresh and filling. Panera is my go to place, because I can depend on the quality and consistency of anything I order no matter if I'm in VA or Texas. 

This site was a huge disappointment. I ordered the pick 2 - apple turkey sandwich and the Asian salad on this particular visit . I even tipped and my meal was tossed on 
my table. I had to put my sandwich together before I could eat it, as the turkey was lying next to the bread - totally made with no love. My salad which is usually too much to finish, barely filled half of the bowl. 
The lettuce was not fresh-1/3 of it was brownish lettuce. I left there hungry for the first time ever after telling one of the girls there who apologized but was not interested . This happened yesterday around 2:30...have a talk with your staff because you have won the prize for the worst Panera ever."}
{"text":"Lunchtime and there's 8 people here! Maybe because per usual, the y have a choice of 5 bagels and 4 loaves of bread! Unengaged employees and turkey sandwiches with 3 Oz of meat! Why do we keep coming back here!!!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations as I hadn't had paradise bakery in a couple years as they don't have them near my new home.  

The insides haven't changed much since I've been here.. Same decor and layout.  
I may my way through the line and came up with a turkey bacon avocado sandwich of sorts.  I also had a chocolate chip cookie and some fruit salad.  The sandwich was just ok, it was lacking something.  The turkey was a little dry and lacking some flavor.  However the fruit salad was very good, fresh and  yummy. 

The chocolate chip cookie was very good, just as I remember them. Soft and great taste. Bought some coconut choco chip cookies to take home to the wife.  

Just an average experience.. service was good, but the sandwich just didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing, from the food to the atmosphere and the staff. 

Not sure if anyone cares about how a place actually treats their employees, but back in high school and early college this was one of my first jobs, and though it was a minimum wage job it is probably the best minimum wage job out there. Staff and customers are always friendly and it really adds to the place. I was happy working there. (The only reason I left is because I eventually needed a better paying job to pay for school and living expenses.)

The atmosphere is very relaxed and often I still return to study or meet up with friends. Even when I fly around the country I somehow always end up at a panera bread because I know it will be yummy, relaxing, clean, and everyone will be friendly. 

The food is also consistently great. The salads, breads, and coffees are my absolute favorites. The bread and pastries are made fresh everyday and what is not bought by the end of the night is donated. 

Great place, especially if you are looking for some R&R or a nice place to study. :)"}
{"text":"It really makes me sad this place sucks so much because it's very convenient. I've been there so many times and they have gotten worse. My order is constantly wrong. Many times there were hair in my food. And last night I got the turkey avocado BLT, it had bacon bits not one slice of bacon and there was no avocado. However instead of telling me there was no avocado when I asked for extra they said nothing and had me pay for something I didn't receive. Definitely a lesson to check your food before you leave the restaurant."}
{"text":"I only gave an additional star because I love Panera's food. Customer Service here is horrible!!! So unprofessional. My cashier was ok but her coworker friend was TALKING to her while I was trying to order. I was struggling to concentrate on what I was saying until I just paused until she felt like she was done. I followed it up with a dirty look because I specifically wanted her to know how rude that was!! 

Waited for my food for like 10 mins and the woman who preps the food was giving the cashier tips out loud on what she was doing wrong. That is something that should be addressed privately. Not in front of the customers

Last but not least when I picked up my order I got an awkward stare from the girl who runs food to the tables. Guess she had to tell the food prep lady something and was waiting til I left to start the gossip. She looked at me like she was ANNOYED that I took a sec to put my straw in the bag, my drink and purse in one hand, and bag of food in the other hand. So RUDE!!"}
{"text":"we frequent Panera Bread in Charlotte all the time. this is our first bad experience at any of them. I had the half Tuna and half Greek salad. The Salad barely had any olives and Feta cheese. I felt ike I was having a Lettuce salad. My daughter's soup of cream and wild rice was lumpy and my Nephew's chicken soup was cold. I dont know if I would ever go back to that particular location but they definitely lack the consistency of the other Panera Breads."}
{"text":"A gift card of $10 and then another $12 was too much for a cold bowl of chowder, gritty salad, and a crusted spoon.  When asking for a clean spoon, apologies were offered.  But, when I took the soup back, the attitude was much different.  The cook said she would have to \"open a new bag\", but she was told no but the window manager.  Within 3 minutes I had a steaming hot bowl of soup.  Can we say \"MICROWAVE\"?  Maybe / maybe not?
We have been to this location many times since it opened.  But the cleanliness of the restaurant and the attitudes of some workers have declined.  Panera continues to raise its prices, but not its standards.  So sad!"}
{"text":"Why is it every time I come in this location it is filthy. It is always a mess and tables not wiped down, floors never swept.  I thought today I would do a yelp post because it appears to be more of a norm than an anomaly."}
{"text":"Order was taken promptly. Upon finding  a table, go a rocker , ask server for a widget, Didn't  have a clue.  Tried to work with  napkins- no luck- moved tables.
 Before leaving went  to restroom, cafe floor looked like a garbage  dump behind the service  line  was worse.They need to change more t han just their name..."}
{"text":"Went to Panera today and got my favorite, a Frontega Chicken Panini with tomato soup.  When I got home, THERE WAS NO CHICKEN!!!!  How do they not add the star of the sandwich?¿  when I called to let them know their error, I was treated as if I were lying. 

The last time I was there I asked for extra chipotle mayo, when I got home, there was absolutely no mayo on the sandwich,  whatsoever.  This time I checked my sandwich for mayo and found an abundance. Guess I should've checked a lot closer.

They say orders are double checked for accuracy, I call bullcrap.  I will NEVER go back to OR recommend this location again."}
{"text":"Rose YOU ROCK!!!!! Rose gave me the best customer service ever at the drive thru! If I had my own company rose would be making millions for being so awesome! You made my day 300xs better everyone needs a rose at their company! She is a model employee!"}
{"text":"This place is always good. I don't go extremely often, but whenever I do the staff is attentive, the service fast, and the food is hot and fresh. The menu boasts a wide array of soups, sandwiches, salads, and pastries. A friend of mine likened it to Starbucks' food. Frankly, I think that's an insult to Panera, wish is orders of magnitude better and more affordable."}
{"text":"I went to the self service line and tried to order my personal favorite, Mac and Cheese in a bread bowl, what do you know? Bread bowls are unavailable I even asked the worker at the counter! (so much for being a \"Bread\" company) so I settle and get just a Mac and Cheese NO bread bowl. I sit down with my lady and we began eating I look to my right because i felt a strange presence. Its another customer with TWO FREAKING BREADBOWLS. I was furious because i was lied to straight to my face and not given even a shred of customer service.

P.S. I made a yelp account just for this horrible experience."}
{"text":"I just left there. Messed up my order - no salad dressing in my salad. No chips as ordered but charged me for baguette and chips. The \"checkers\" clearly did not check my meal."}
{"text":"Paneras restaurant staff face piercings are unappetizing"}
{"text":"Had a bowl of mac n cheese which was really good but expensive at $7.99. The dinner rolls are always stale and the bread always comes cold. Wish there were more fresh bread choices in the bakery besides just sourdough and bagels. We also had the tomato soup which was tasty and a sandwich on flat bread which came with kettle chips but those are not very good. They are salty but too crunchy and no flavor."}
{"text":"I've only been to this location and so far I think Panera is alright. I do like how they have a nice selection for Veggies, but the prices and quality sometimes can be less then expected. For one, in my opinion, the sandwiches are more bread than anything else, albeit good bread. I would like better sides than bread, apples or chips. Want more bread with your bread?
Service has always been great, tables always clean and to go boxes stocked. 
Personally I love their black bean soup- the tomato and mozzarella sandwich is alright. The only pastries I have had have been at the end of the day and kind of dry, but hey, my fault for getting them so late."}
{"text":"Food was good. It was made fairly quickly. They have self service kiosks as well. Pretty cool. Very roomy with outdoor seating. Food was tasty. Mac and cheese is phenomenal. One less star because when we walked in the worker just stared at us like a deer in headlights. No hello, no welcome, nothing.. When she took our order she looked almost scared. Lmaoooo. I'm laughing as I write this because of how ridiculous it was. Maybe she's scared of Mexicans? Lol."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience, and great staff. Cindy is extremely polite and helpful. This location has food that is always fresh, and the restaurant is always clean. I hope this standard is maintained for the coming years!"}
{"text":"Its opeeennnnnnnnn. yayyyyyyyyyyy. I no longer need to go to New Jersey for it. Hehe.

Andres had noooo idea what he was doing at the register. Missed up my order 3 times after I told him to repeat my order. Smh. Anyways. They JUST open. So its whatever,  i understand you're learning still.

The pasta was wayyy to oily. :/
My spinach power salad was decent, but my Mediterranean sandwich was delicious. :) the pesto sauce was perfect. I was happy.

Tropical hibiscus is a mustttttttt for your meal fyi. :))

I shall come back."}
{"text":"I had not been to Panera for awhile when I stopped in here yesterday. I wasn't really sure why or when I stopped coming. There wasn't a particular event that triggered it. I think I just got tired of Panera.

I remember when this franchise started popping up over the landscape, how refreshing it was to have an alternative to grease-laden guilt of the usual fast food restaurants. Decent soup, sandwiches, and salads in a carefully-calculated coffeehouse atmosphere....it was way better than getting raped in the arteries by Ronald McDonald, The King, or Dave Thomas. But as I sat there waiting for my order yesterday, with a huge 5-pound red-flashing pager in hand, I came to the conclusion that Panera has become a franchise struggling to maintain it's levels of quality and service...perhaps a victim of it's own tremendous success???

The waiting period for food seems to continue to grow longer and longer at Panera, creating an awkward fast-food purgatory, where people mull around with pagers, wondering whether to sit or stand. The staff behind the counter seem as miserable as ever. They've totally scrapped that perky, friendly coffeehouse charade they had working years ago. Now, they just look stressed out and pissed off about the prospect of making yet another sandwich for their increasingly impatient guests. The manager was busy reprimanding one of the cash register girls for taking a \"custom\" order for a panini while I stood there. 

When my sandwich (tomato & mozzerella panini) was finally off the assembly line, I was disappointed. Frankly, it sucked. Worst creation I've ever had from a Panera. It tasted like grilled bread covered with marinara sauce, nothing like the fresh caprese taste I was looking for. Pesto was scarce. My ration of potato chips was pretty disappointing, too. You could count individual chips in a single glance...maybe 10 to 12 good sized chips, with some smaller objects orbiting around the larger planets. I'm all for helping the average American lower their intake of junk food, but don't take it out personally on me, man. I just paid $10 for this. 

I'm issuing 3-stars here because I guess I'm still thankful for Panera's existence, even though I think it's slipping. It's still a better alternative to having to give oral to whatever promo partnership Hollywood crapola is taking place over at Burger King this week."}
{"text":"This review is for this Paradise location only: If any of the folks who work here are in Paradise when I get there, I'm taking the first train to hell. Absolutely no sense of urgency. Running in for coffee? Take a book because the system they have set up for service means you'll just stand there while the apparent only person who can help you is nowhere to be found. Guarantee, once they appear, they'll be surly and rude. I've been going to this location for five years now because I live in the neighborhood but I have to brace myself for the bad attitudes every time I go in. Service (barely) with (no) smiles."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I know mistakes happen but when they do you should prioritize fixing them. I should not have had to wait twenty minutes to receive my order after it was messed up. There are plenty of other Paneras in Phoenix. I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to Panera whenever I crave for something light and healthy. Their salads are really good with great portion sizes.
I also like that they give a side of apple, chips or bread. Their soups are pretty amazing too, and pretty filling especially when you have it in their bread bowls. 
They have an endless variety of menu options and whats a bonus is that you can order half portions, and thereby can try 2 different things.
This location can get pretty crowded, especially during lunch time. This has resulted in a long line and lack of tables.
But overall, I've never had a bad experience and will definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I ordered the green goddess salad see below pics this is how much dressing I was given. I tried to call Panera to speak to a manager but was unable to get through. This isn't enough dressing to wet half of my salad."}
{"text":"Employees who don't give a damn = Terrible customer service!!
I only go to this location because I can walk from my office.  Never again!!!  First of all, their employees by far are the worst in customer service that I've ever seen in my life. They mumble, don't look you in the eye --they don't care at all. I have had to walk back when the order was wrong. And even the manager could not have cared less. She said \"oh you can keep that soup\" well I don't like that soup so why would I want to eat it?! The other day I went in there at 11:15.am. There was one cashier and a man at the counter, who was trying to place an order while he was on the phone getting information from someone else. The man was asking for descriptions of every sandwich ,every salad, and then trying to relay it to the person on the phone. That cashier should've told him to get his order straight and come back up. No one else was working the counter. And I watched the manager who is back in the prep area keep looking up at the ever-growing line. The manager did not do a thing. I walked out. 
PATHETIC 

I worked in fast food all through high school, and I worked in a bank both as a teller and as a branch manager for many years. I know what it's like to wait on customers. And when I was a manager I was not above opening up a teller window or helping with new accounts.    No one at this Panera location cares about anything."}
{"text":"I love this place but lately they have been slipping. A bunch of college kids employees just joking not paying attention for getting the order done. They forgot a sandwich and I had to ask them again to make even though I put it down in my order. I mean what they do is not hard if they want to keep their job, might wanna fix this."}
{"text":"Over priced sandwich was small and went from one end to the other to get drinks coffee condiments...was still hungry when I left..
Getting in and ordering was confusing..
Employees on their phones and. Not helping for a sandwich shouldn't take as long as it did..ooo and chipz....ya chips...
Was not impressed...wont be back."}
{"text":"Prices on the high side for what you get, but always consistent. Use the online ordering, and your order will be ready for you to grab and go. You can even order online and have them bring it to your table! If you order at the indoor kiosk, don't forget to grab a cup and get your own drink...that part is self service."}
{"text":"I can't say I wasn't warned - the reviews warned me not to go through the drive through - yet I did anyway.  I was missing a sandwich and my salad was not made how I asked for it.  I then parked and went inside to let them know and the lady behind the counter actually started arguing with me stating that my order was correct.  I told her no, I didn't just pay $20 for one salad - one that was not made how I asked for it at that.  

Needless to say - these reviews are spot on.  I will NOT be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Never had an issue with this Panera. Drive thru pretty fast considering the nature of people ordering more specialized \"fast\" foods. Great pastries and drinks. Love the ease of a drive thru here!"}
{"text":"Meh! I ordered the Fuji Apple salad, wish I had looked at the picture (someone else ordered for me and picked up order) as it had freeze dried thin apple slices (you know, the kind you pack in your toddlers backpack). I threw them away and sliced a fresh apple instead. You really should use fresh Fuji Apples, would make that salad the bomb!!!"}
{"text":"Been to this location a number of times.  Service has always been very solid.  Only Panera I've been to with a drive thru, which is an added convenience."}
{"text":"Panera Bread at this Bathurst/Centre Street location I find it is much better than the one up at Yonge/16th.

Love the small booth seatings at the back of the restaurant. Basically, you can veg out here for the whole day with your laptop using their Free WIFI and drink your bottomless coffee ($2.09) from a mug!

I don't believe my eyes when I see 2 outlets for each ot the booth seatings! This is better than doing my work in a library! 

Panera Bread at this location may be the to go place for me with my laptop when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"This is a brand new Panera Bread location just open up 2 months ago.

I was here on a snowy Tuesday evening for a quick bite just before catching a movie across the street. It was not busy at all compared to other Panera Bread locations I have been to.

The cashier was quite patience as I tried to decide what I want to order as I always get a little over whelmed with the selection! 

Spinach Power Salad with Ham and Cheese Sandwich tasted A-OK! And I even got a free Birthday Pastry with my reward card!

The interior is clean and spacious. I think I would be back to use their wifi next time I am in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Dropped by here to meet a friend for a quick breakfast.  

I have to say I have an ok experience since the setting here is cozy with private booth seats.. free WIFI.. ok food...

But everything here is so cold....don't have that little bakery family runned feel to it, which I really enjoy. I just feel like going into a MacDonald or something. But at least I can drink my coffee from a mug not a foam cup.

I might come again but it will not be a place I will hang out too often.

2 star but 1 star extra for free WIFI without access code!

They accepts all credit cards!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Too bad they don't have close by where we live in the North area.  But whenever we are on this side of town we come here!  The panini's are the best and the broccoli & cheddar soup is yummy!  The employees are also great and recommend the best food if you're not too sure of what to choose off the menu."}
{"text":"Finally a Panera Bread opens in Markham., and welcome to the neighborhood! 

On Grand Opening Day, energy buzzing in the air. 

Staffs are just so excited to serve all these exciting customers that dropping by to have their first taste of the baked good, sandwiches and soup they offers. 

Huge seating area, tons of outlets and free WIFI! 

Now this maybe the location I will drop by often to chill!

PS lunch hour rush is crazy during the opening week... line all the way out to the door!"}
{"text":"Ehhhh....... I have had way better. The service personally was very kind and sweet, but the food... Omg... My poor panini was half dressed, and mushy. Poor spinach was stiff. Maybe I'll try a smoothie or something next time. Cafe Zuppas for the win on soup/sammmich/salads!"}
{"text":"I am sad that they got rid of the Chipotle chicken panini, but I tried one of their new items called the Frontega chicken panini suggested by the staff member because he was also a fan of the Chipotle sandwich and it did not disappoint.  He told me to also order a side of bbq sauce and use it to my hearts desire. It has all the flavors you would expect of Panera, but I will have to ask them to hold the onions next time.  I'm just not a fan of raw onions and if you are not either you should do the same.  It overpowered the sandwich for me, but once I removed it, it came out perfectly."}
{"text":"I don't know what's up with all the bad reviews here. I have nothing to complain about and the food here is as good as at other Paneras."}
{"text":"The food was great but always wonder why the dining room needs attending to and it doesn't always feel so clean.  Noticed this in many locations."}
{"text":"Honestly, if you've been to one Panera bread you have been to every Panera bread.  What kind of irks me is they have become the de facto place for business meetings.  With the cleanliness of the place (which is always on point) and the free wi-if, I can see why.  

But what I truly love about this place, is there scones!  It's true... Their scones, buttery, crumbly and flavorful.  Cinnamon is probably my favorite.  They are four dollars yes, but they are happiness, delight and deliciousness all rolled together. Panera also has really delicious flavored coffee and ice coffees.

Where they dropped the ball in their beverage offerings, are their fountain drinks. I can appreciate them trying to educate consumers on how much sugar is in the drink (it is printed on the side of the cup) but it is awful that they don't put any sugar in your drink if you want it.  In fairness they did  have the packets of sugar which take too long to dissolve.
On the two days I went there, the sugar pumps they provide for those who want sweetened drinks were empty.  So basically they charge you upwards of three dollars for what tastes like unsweetened Kool-Aid with giant sugar crystals sitting at the bottom.

I don't care about their food menu.  It is like upgraded hospital food.  Not bad enough to complain, but not good enough to rave over either.  I mean they try.  The other day I think I tasted some sweet potato spread on my dry turkey sandwich.  So there is that!

P.S. Parking here is a nightmare!"}
{"text":"I find the food is overpriced for what you get- my son and i went in he got the grilled cheese and a coffee and i got half a sandwich and soup, and a coffee and the upsold the fresh baked cookies and the bill was almost 30 dollars. The staff is friendly, and the food is consistent, not that this is a good thing. I did not like my sandwich at all, it was a Mediterranean chicken- just bland and not good at all, but there are others that are good- not great, but good. The Broccoli soup tastes processed, like they just heat it up out of a vat or it's powdered and they reconstitute it. It's thin and runny, not rich and thick as it should be.

The mac and cheese is delicious but the serving is very small. The grilled cheese is always really good, it is greasy and all but it's good.

I always tend to end up here when I am looking for something not fast food, and I always regret it after because it is so expensive. The coffee is good, and the baked goods always look and smell good, but the only thing I have tried is the brownie and the chocolate chip cookie, and neither were AMAZING, just ok.

It's not that I don't recommend it, but as i mentioned I always tend to regret going there after I leave- it's just not a good return on investment I find."}
{"text":"Lot of bad reviews for this Panera but our experience was nothing but pleasant. Quick and friendly service, food was done within 10 minutes. Orders were all correct. Mac and cheese is always THE BEST. Always reliable and delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful experience at the Panera bread. Unfriendly disgruntled staff. They got the order wrong, when I came back to ask them, they said they ran out of some of the ingredients. There was no mention about that when I ordered it or when they handed me my food. If they were honest up front and had given me the opportunity to change my order, it would have been a much different experience. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"Staff here is hit or miss: every time I make a trip here, I always get greeted by a grumpy lady or a super nice guy. (But the food is so good, I deal with it anyways). Me and my boyfriend get the chicken noodle soup bread bowl when we go. I always dip the lid of the bread bowl in the soup and eat it that way- it is amazing oml. I also get a French baguette for my side for the same reason. He gets kettle cooked chips for his side. I prefer the bread. Overall though, this place foodwise is amazing. Had it yesterday and getting it to go today!"}
{"text":"It may seem pointless to review a restaurant as ubiquitous as Panera, but I'll weigh in since I've been using a local PBC as a hangout to enjoy plentiful coffee and wifi during some recent vacation time.

Panera has executed a winning formula and they've found the magic spot, IMO. They've got the two things that make an attractive hangout to me: DIY coffee refills and easy/reliable wifi. These two basics combine to make a nearly irresistible draw for me, and judging from the other regulars I see there, I'm not alone in feeling this way. Add to this their creative, diverse and evolving menu, and you've got a pretty reliable attraction.

I've always been the guy to resist carrying punch cards and participating in shopping memberships, but I confess that I now have a Panera mini-scan card on my key ring? Why? I use Panera a lot while around my home town, and I use it frequently when I travel, so I finally decided it would be worth it to explore their bonus programs. I know these things are designed to provide simple behavioral conditioning, and to set up a feedback/reward system that will keep you coming back. And you know what? It works. I love earning free bagels, or breakfast pastries, or a free cup of coffee.

I'm sold. Panera is doing a lot of things right. From offering mobile ordering from your phone (while already in the restaurant!), to easy table delivery, to staff bussing tables and keeping things tidy, they're doing it all, and doing it well. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I tend to use Panera Bread for two main purposes: a convenient alternative to more conventional coffee shops when I'm looking for a place to park my laptop with bottomless coffee, and a go-to place for reliable good food and good wi-fi when I'm on the road. I don't go deep on their menu but have historically liked their coffee (BIG fan of customer refillable coffee) and baked goods. So there are a few things that I need to work well in Panera: plenty of electrical outlets where I can plug in my laptop or recharge my phone, clean tables near those outlets, and fresh coffee.

For some reason, this Panera fails on the first two of those conditions. The dining room is a bit smaller than a typical PBC store, and there aren't many outlets available. I've also found that they seem to be less diligent on wiping the tables than the other Madison location that I frequent. The food is good (solid - standard Panera) and the staff seem friendly and helpful. It's  just not the same easy, effortless experience that I've come to expect of Panera. As a result, I don't use this location as much."}
{"text":"Your \"fast order tablets\" was pretty amazing. Half the fun is finding out which of the 8 tablets work, while the three workers dodge customers. I was pretty impressed because it only take 10 minutes a order in line. Good place if you want be pissed first thing in the morning . I'm looking at 4 workers with their backs turned while three people waiting lol as I'm typing this."}
{"text":"I have visited this place 3 times. The parking is horrible, but I try to come later in the evening when there is a few spaces. The place it pretty pricey for sandwiches and salads I think. I had a gift card so I didnt have spend any money out of pocket. It seems like every time I come here, the girl or whoever is on the register  always has a little attitude, it like the register girl is upset that I am using a gift card or something, I dont know. Maybe cause it the almost the end of the day or hell maybe she is on her period or something. 

The last time i visited this location which was last week, I ordered a some kind of turkey panini (of which I ordered the last two times I visited this place) with the person who makes the sandwiches, then I went down to where the soups where and order mac and cheese. The stupid girl that makes the sandwiches said I was suppose to order the mac and cheese with the person who makes the sandwiches and to remember that for next time. I almost went off on this bitch but no reason to do that, again I think these heifers are on their period all the time. Next time put the damn mac and cheese in the section where the damn sandwiches are located and not on the menu where fuckin soups are if you want me to order it with the sandwich maker or just make one ordering spot where I can tell my order to one person instead of having to go to 3 fuckin people to make my order. 

The people here suck, the food is cool."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place with fresh coffee and tasteful bakeries. Yujie and I have tried the bacon/egg sandwich and Carmel latte. Consistent good quality"}
{"text":"Wow, such a nice location, 
Just as nice as the employees...
Cashier was Jaquan,
he helped me choose out my lunch out of the 
many many selections at Panera Bread. 

TYSM for your friendly service, 
I'll be coming back soon"}
{"text":"If you don't know what Panera bread company is all about, they are a quick-serve restaurant chain with over 2000 locations.  A point of difference between Panera and most of their competitors is Panera's food menu items are free of artificial colors,flavors, sweeteners and preservatives.  

The restaurant offers a nice selection of pastries and baked goods. My choice At Panera is usually a sandwich or a Panini. Additionally, they have appealing choices of pastries, soups and salads along with plenty of options for hot and cold beverages. 

On this visit I ordered the chipotle chicken avocado melt - I quickly devoured this wonderful Panini and the bag of chips that came with it. For my beverage, I had a flavored iced tea... Refreshing! 

My sandwich had a homemade vibe and I would order it again.  That being said, Panera deserves its high rank on my list of quick-serve restaurant - national sandwich/ bakery shops.

Salute!"}
{"text":"I was in line for a salad when a woman behind told the cashier there were numerous flies sitting on the cookies and pastries, the cashier looked at her confused and said \"Okay.\" The prospective customer then said \"Ma'am, they're all over the cookies... look...\" as she pointed to the flies sitting on the cookies. The cashier then says \"I'll let the baker know.\" She then took 2 orders including mine, and never told \"the baker.\" I understand flies in a place of business are out of their control, I currently have a fly flying around the office right now... but I sat down and ate my salad, and noticed that the cookies and pastries were never taken down or thrown out. I was disgusted by the lack of concern, and will probably never go there again."}
{"text":"I came in from Minnesota and had problems with my Panera card. The manager and staff were so helpful. The manager was well know my the customers and was very friendly!!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly for their delivery service, as we have not had an issue in store (why I'm not giving 1 star).  

We used the delivery service for the first time, and we will never do it again.  The order was missing items, salads had the wrong dressing, my daughters yogurt was piping hot (not cold as yogurt should be), soup was missing cheese and croutons which should be in it, and order was supposed to be delivered by 5:28-5:38 and did not arrive until 6:06 (almost 30 minutes late).  The delivery driver did apologize for the order being late, and if it was just late I wouldn't have been upset, but to be late and be so wrong deserved a bad review.  To panera's credit I did call and speak with a manager who apologized and did cancel the order and said it should not appear on our credit card statement.  So again in store seems fine, but I would 100% stay away from the delivery service."}
{"text":"Love Panera bread! So lucky to have them catered to my office. Everything is always delicious. Never a disappointment."}
{"text":"I thought it was ok.  I had a kale salad with chicken, and it was nice.  I also had a soup, but did not care for it.  I don't even remember what kind it was.  The chocolate chip cookie was good.  Overall it was fine, nothing outstanding, but I am willing to try it again.  

The drive though line was crazy long, but they mananged to keep it going, so I didn't have too bad of a wait."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep giving this place second chances... Every single time I have gone through the drive through something goes wrong. Super soggy bread for paninis, frozen chicken, missing meals, rock solid avocados, skimpy salads... just to name a few. And the service is not very good. Wish there were better healthy options around here...
The only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is because the Autumn Squash Soup is awesome."}
{"text":"Resturant prices at a 'fast food-ish' type place... but the quality is worth it. Everything is super fresh and they pay attention to detail. I love the food, black bean soup is addicting and the salads are super fresh and loaded with veggies. Good casual place that is kid friendly, has wi-fi and an amazing dessert/bread selection. If you want to sit, relax and eat perfect spot."}
{"text":"Addicted to the black bean soup, thats all I have to say!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of panera... this one is much fancier than others in the area. They have a drive thru, a REALLY nice patio and they bring the food to your table. Only bad part is the view from the patio is wal mart. Food was consistent as the other paneras and they had the new 'secret menu' which my friend ordered a salad from and really enjoyed (greek I think?)"}
{"text":"I'd like to visit Panera as an occasional alternative to Starbucks, but I'm torn. There are a few things about Panera that are all right:  I don't tend to feel cramped when I'm there, their seating is comfortable, and the place is \"mostly\" clean (sometimes they are slow to bus tables).  I wish some of their employees were friendlier, but I've seen much worse.  But three problems really stand out:
  
1) Not enough seating near electric outlets
2) THE WORST MUSIC ON THE FACE OF THIS EARTH  
3) Food that is waaaaaaaay overpriced for the quality and quantity served.

Although people hang out at Panera's for hours, I get the impression that Panera would prefer they don't, hence the aural torture and lack of sockets. They don't have to worry about me- I won't be going there much at all."}
{"text":"Some/most of the employees are super nice here. They really do a good job of keeping the place clean & checking in on you. My only complaint is that the last 3 or so times that we've come they've been completely out of breads or foods but still take my order as if they do have the items. For example: I ordered a brioche bread roll, \"we're out\". Asked for another soft roll, got sliced white piece  customers next to ordered bread bowls. They sat down after putting in their order & surprise, surprise they're out of bread bowls. It's prime time dinner time guys. Same with the soup. Didn't have the vegetarian kind...so I'm SOL"}
{"text":"What a shame though we would try it for lunch and the bread my daughter got for her PBJ had green mold on it I told the lady there and she tried to assure me that it wasn't mold. She brought us a new one for her on the same bread and low and behold no green on it at all, food here is a little pricey especially for the area save your money and definitely check the bread."}
{"text":"I've never had Panera Bread before, but for a first-timer, this location gave me a rather pleasant experience. 

I'll admit, I was very overwhelmed when I first walked into the store. All the different that's on display to choose from as well as the large selection from their actual menu, you could say I literally had no idea what to get

As I looked through the menu, I had a hard time understanding it. I was a little shy to ask the cashier what the \"pick 2\" options meant, because I didn't want to seem like I couldn't read a menu, but when I finally got the courage to ask, he told me that it's actually a very common thing people ask him about. 

I found out that if you pick 2 things from the menu that's labeled with \"pick 2\", then that's the price you will get those items for. Silly me; of course it was something as simple as that. 

I ended up deciding on their most popular items: the chipotle chicken avocado melt and the cheese broccoli soup. When the order came, I was notified that they barely had any cheese broccoli soup left, so they were nice enough to give me whatever was left as well as a full bowl of whatever soup to my choosing. 

The cheese broccoli soup matched my tastes spot on. It was on the cheesier side, so dipping the free bread they give in there for the first time, it packed more of a zing than I thought. There were no huge broccoli chunks which I found nice. 

I also quite liked the melt; however, I'm a tad disappointed that it didn't have that chipotle style heat in the back of your mouth like the name promised. Oh well. Still tasted good. 

Solid 4 to me."}
{"text":"It surprised me how busy this place is, I didn't enjoy anything here. I ordered the mushroom breadbowl soup, but they didn't have the bread available. I quickly got a pecan cinnamon bun and some healthy looking bottled strawberry juice....both were bad. Nothing else on the menu seemed to pack a punch to satisfy me; and I thought it was ridiculous to run out of bread 

-dryest bun I've ever bought with barely any cinnamon
-strawberry bottled drink was just water sweetener and some flavouring"}
{"text":"I generally get the Mediterranean Panini... and the soup.. Standard stuff, pretty good!"}
{"text":"This is such an odd Panera. When I first moved to the states I was so excited by this fresh new chain where it seemed like you could get a endless array of breakfast and lunch options. This Panera seems very empty in comparison. It's like they're constantly on the verge of closing shop. 

Food: breakfast options and pastries are the name of the game at this location. I've been here twice, mostly late morning, and have yet to see sandwiches or salads available. Half the store is empty. I'm guessing that that half used to be/will at some point be the lunch area. I got their everything bagel and onion spread. Pretty good!

Coffee: it's fine over here. You get a cup and fill it up. 

Service: this is the best thing at this location. People are friendly and helpful. 

Seating and ambiance: the patio is nice, and its usual full of retirees or young families. It's a quiet spot to get a quick breakfast. I've been thinking about studying here... but I'm not sure if it's going to happen. Sometimes a girl wants more than just a bagel you know?"}
{"text":"Food is good as at any other location, but service is horrible. Three of us were ordering together, and the order was taken by a manager, who was just out of it. The staff seem like they dont know what they are doing, very slow and annoyed. 10 minutes after we ordered, somebody came to our table and told us they actually ran out of bread bowls. Maybe the manager should have mentioned it earlier? Anyways, got free pastry for that."}
{"text":"Panera Bread would be my version of heaven. There's nothing I love more than a hearty soup in a bread bowl! This isn't my preferred location because of how busy it can get as it's right by the Toronto Eaton Center and Ryerson University. Even so, their customer service is better than the other locations I've been to.

I always ask for a soup in a bread bowl because you just can't beat that. Some of my favourite soups include Mushroom with truffles, Broccoli cheddar, French Onion, Garden vegetable, and Turkey Chilli. Their iced teas are good as you determine the sweetness. Their selection of cookies, cakes and all things sweet are also yummy."}
{"text":"My fondness for this place stems from the memory of enjoying my first bread bowl. From that moment on I was a changed woman. Until then, every soup I had was missing something and that something was a carbohydrate-packed exterior that I could devour. Their other things are good - paninis, sandwiches, and pasta but it's the bread bowls that keep me coming back. This is a decent location but seating can fill up fast.

Some of my favourite soups include Mushroom with truffles, Broccoli cheddar, French Onion, Garden vegetable, and Turkey Chilli. Don't forget to ask for it in a bread bowl! Also check out their selection of pastries and desserts which are absolutely delectable."}
{"text":"My daughter loves this place. When she decided to host her school meeting at this location, I said ok without hesitation. The venue is large, open and airy, so you can have a nice little meeting without having a ton of interruptions. She ordered a tea and muffin. I ordered a cup of soup. We got our pager and sat down. Almost 20 minutes later, I still had nothing. So I asked the server if he could check on my order. Shock of shocks, they \"lost\" my order. So disappointing. Why have a pager in place if you don't plan on using it? It isn't busy. It isn't rush hour. And they ask you to pre-tip on checkout, which I foolishly did. I will encourage the girls to try a new location next time because this was discouraging and disappointing."}
{"text":"I don't like giving bad reviews but they're out of many bagels and didn't hear me when I asked for coffee. They're known for their bagels and should not be out of multiple types at 10am. And they have no intention of making more.

When I asked for a refund they seemed surprised I didn't want a plain bagel. I can go anywhere for that but I chose to come here and was very disappointed in the service and selection.

I would avoid this location until they decide to bake enough to meet demand."}
{"text":"My mom and I, (along with another friend) sat on the patio the other day... My mom ordered a soup and bread bowl.. Once she was almost done with it, she found a nice big hair... Went to talk to someone about it, and the person at the counter said \"well you should go tell the people who made it.\" My mom asked for the manager, and explain the situation, the manager would not refund my mom, but handed her a gift card instead. Absolutely no urgency, or no care went into making the situation at hand any better. 
So a little while later, I decided to go in a buy a bagel.. (Toasted) well I got it, went back to sit down, and the bagel was not toasted, so I went back in, and told the lady who took my order if she would please toast it for me.. Well she just looked at me and said \"oh, (coworkers name) didn't do that\"?
No one seems to care here, or take anything seriously. Especially when there is a hair in the food!?


PLUS. My mom went back in today, to see if she could buy some bagels for the $ amount from her lunch, (as the manager said she could) well different manager today.. He shrugged his shoulders and said nothing he can do. My mom and her friend going to this location at least 2-3 times a week. She will not be back. Lost a very good customer over some terrible management and not a care in the world to make the situation correct."}
{"text":"I love Panera. Like, really, I do. I like the ones back home in Chicago and I even like the one by Marketplace Mall. This particular one on Green Street is so bad though. I walked in at about 2PM and there was no sign about how fresh the coffee was. I understand it's not morning, but the coffee bar looked a mess. If I did that kind of poorly at my job, I would be fired or at least told about it! Even the service is bad. The cashier is literally there to ring you up and take your order. No smile, no friendly attitude or anything. I don't think I'll try going back here until this changes."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with Panera!! I always go to the Lake Mead and Tenaya location and get the \"Pick Two\": BBQ chicken flatbread, with chicken caesar salad, and an apple. I have always loved that combination and it's my favorite food... LITERALLY!!

Now, I go to the Boca Park location, as I was closer to it, and on my BBQ chicken flatbread, there were two pieces of chicken on a CHICKEN FLATBREAD, which made it more of a spinach and cheese flatbread. So I was already in shock when I ate it. 

Next, I go to eat my salad. At my normal location, they put the perfect amount of sauce and it's not too much nor too little. I go to Boca Park and it's way too much dressing and way too fishy! 

I was surprised my apple didn't have a worm in it. 

Overall, I'm not pleased and will only be attending my regular Panera, even if it means using a little extra gas."}
{"text":"When I love Panera the delivery is a hoax unless you are blocks away they do not deliver they should stipulate that they have the shortest deliver range"}
{"text":"Completely disappointed... Their salads and sandwiches are very bland.  The vegetables they use are not fresh. Not going back."}
{"text":"This location is always busy! Sometimes you have to circle around the lot a few times to find a spot.  Always try to go a bit before or after the lunch rush to guarantee a table.  Seating is comprised of a mix of booths, tables and comfy sofa chairs. The occasional electric fireplace makes for a relaxing atmosphere.

Noise level is fairly loud, as it's a typical spot for friends to meet up and chat. So if you're coming to do some work prepare for that! There is free wifi, although during early afternoon it is restricted to two-hours of use (something about sharing the Internet with others..) 

The orange scone here is divine (but not cheap! $3.75 if I remember correctly). I usually get a tea and its self-serve, they give your cup and you go to the station choose your tea (several varieties like ginger peach, earl grey, etc.) and pour your water.  Honey and milk is available. The food isn't anything to die for in my opinion, but it's decent for what it is.

I've always found the staff to be friendly and helpful.  

You can sign up for their loyalty card. It gives you occasional perks and freebies and a treat on your birthday!"}
{"text":"Finally went to this panera bread this weekend and was not impressed. I got 2 lox cal mango smoothies, salad, and a sandwich and it came to about $30. The salad was just chopped up lettuce with bread, my dog could probably make a better salad with grass from the lawn. The chicken noodle soup tasted like a soup straight out the hospital. The sandwich was made out of 2 pieces of chicken, one slice of tomato, and some sauce. It was so toasted you could eat the edges. The only decent thing was the mango smoothie. Not surprised there were less than 10 people when I arrived. Should've just gone to Buffalo Wild wings, chipotle across the street from there."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered two sandwiches and a southwestern salad ::;without::: chicken this afternoon. I checked the receipt a few minutes later and noticed it said minus ranch and add Thai dressing. I asked the lady by the register she said yes we don't have anymore chipotle ranch dressing. Thai dressing with a southwest salad?? Blakh. I asked her to change the order to a Caesar salad (which by the way is almost $4 less for the full size.. no refund either) and as she places the order she calls me to the counter to tell me there is no Parmesan cheese and I could sub for bleu cheese or feta cheese.. ummm blue cheese and feta with a caesar? Gross. I grabbed the bag and ran to my flight and when we sat in the plane I realized they put chicken all over my Caesar salad. I ended up throwing it away because I hate chicken especially the prepacked fake looking one at Panera and paradise bakery etc. I asked for none for a reason. I was waiting near the register and also heard them calling up other customers constantly telling them that the items in their food was not available and needed to be substituted. Needless to say there were tons and tons of upset customers trying to figure out their ipod orders, which some items were not even listed. After my husband and I ordered, I went to the restroom to wash my hands and when I returned he was still standing at the register and hadn't even paid yet. I wonder how many of his items needed to be substituted too. DEFINITELY won't be back. It's a Friday morning and everyone is traveling for the holidays. How come the inventory hasn't been restocked AND some? It's a busy international airport. I'll never go back. I hope the flight attendant or the trash can enjoy my salad instead."}
{"text":"If you are travelling skip this location. This is a corporate store but terribly managed. Take out orders are routinely filled incorrectly. Restaurant is regularly out of sides- seems to run out of chips or bread. Hit or miss soups on the board are available. No consistency in food-sometimes it is fine other times bad. I am local this location but would recommend travelers to avoid. As a company I suspect Panera is struggling with staffing and food quality and it shows in this store."}
{"text":"Panera Bread has one of the best chicken noodle soups I have tasted since my Grandma's. It hits the spot when you are sick or just on a cold day. 

I also love the fruit salad and the tuna salad sandwich. It goes great with the soup!"}
{"text":"There lunch and dinner menus is good but the breakfast is terrible and the service has gone down hill. Sad and because I used to come here all the time. Our waitress was a little rude too."}
{"text":"Complete dump!!  It's disgusting.  Service is awful as well.  So filthy and it smells!"}
{"text":"Horrible! I ordered online over an hour ago, no email or text updates. I called and was told deliveries are closed for the evening! Why did you take my order then!!! Customer service is at an all time low. I called to inquire and the kid on the phone said delivers were closed and HUNG UP ON ME! i will not be returning in person or by delivery! Listen up chain businesses you cannot deliver sub par service and expect to stay in business."}
{"text":"I don't see how you cannot like Panera Bread. I had lunch there last week while visiting my home office. It was busy but the line moved quickly. I always get the You Pick Two of a half sandwich and some soup. Panera is always consistent for my eating experiences. This restaurant is only about 2-3 years old but this was my first time to visit. Convenient, fast and good food. I will come back!"}
{"text":"Really, it's just pretty average to below-average sandwiches, salads, and soups, for above-average prices.  We went here this weekend, and I was not impressed.  $33 for 3 of us!  My daughter only had the tortellini alfredo with a roll, my mom had 1/2 ham and cheese sandwich and 1/2 salad, and I has a bowl of chicken and wild rice soup and 1/2 of some sandwich that was so forgetful I literally do not remember what it was.  I think it had turkey and avocado on it.  The amount of tortellini my daughter received looked like a kid's meal portion, but it wasn't.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"\"We don't have plain cream cheese\".

Seriously?  Never? No....

OK, I'll go next door to The Coffee Bean."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through got a bagel and coffee with cream and sugar on the side. Waited at the window for 10 minutes for just this. He handed me the bag I looked inside didn't see cream and sugar. Told him I had no cream and sugar. He assured me they were in the bag. I should have told him I checked and they weren't, but I was going to McDonald's right after so figured I'd get them there instead. What I didn't realize though, after I drove off my coffee was cold. So slow. No cream and sugar. Even after I asked. Plus cold coffee."}
{"text":"It's a Panera.. really nothing special and the food is what you should expect. Being in such a busy location such as Miracle Mile however often leaves this place super packed with a line literally out the door. If you're in a rush, this may be a problem. 

One thing I can applaud this place on is their cleanliness. Very rarely will you catch garbage on the ground or a messy table. The food runners are generally pretty quick and pleasant too. 

One problem I've had is that more often than not, my order gets messed up... which isn't a super huge deal to me because it gets fixed- however it is annoying. Not sure exactly what causes the problem there but I know that even when I say I'll never come back to this location I always do because it is so central and convenient."}
{"text":"Menu has changed over the years, but I like Panera for a quick breakfast or lunch option.

My favorites:
Frontega chicken panini
Chicken salad sandwich
Modern Greek salad
Squash soup
French toast bagel with cream cheese
Egg, cheese, bacon on ciabatta
Any muffin or scone

Never had a terrible anything here or other locations I've been to. 

Also, Love the baked goods, fresh bread and the new tea/juice options - love the prickly pear hibiscus fresca! So refreshing."}
{"text":"One star quality because I ordered a BLT Roasted turkey avocado and it had zero avocado on it with two pieces of turkey. You have to at least make the sandwich that people expect what's on it to make it correctly! Unless I asked for those items to be left off. 

They have a manager checking food but clearly NOT if the sandwich was made completely missing what's in the name. 

Service was fast. My soups was hot (nice) but big disappointment when you drive here with not much time and then back to work with incorrect food."}
{"text":"OK I love panera.  Now, it ain't cheap to eat here!  They (finally) brought back the french onion soup.  And I love the broc and cheese in a sourdough bowl.  But I dearly miss the turkey, cheddar Sandwich that was around for Xmas.  ESPECIALLY since they have all the ingredients to make it except the bread.  Hell, they could continue to make the bread too.  Many of us live a good bread with fruit!!!!  Wake up panera US since god knows you make all the decisions relating to food here anyways!!  

And I love their orange scones.  They might not be traditional, but they are good!

Yeah panera.

And please BRING BACK THE TURKEY CHEDDAR SANDWICH, BUT make it a panini, which is how I always ate it.  Yum yum yum.."}
{"text":"I love Panera!   Not the cheapest place in town, but well worth it... The food and desserts are always awesome! 

Love the French onion soup in a sourdough bread bowl, steak sandwich, Fuji apple salad, literally ANY dessert!! 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I've ever given a restaurant 5 stars, but this place deserves it. The staff are friendly and polite. The seating is comfortable even for oversized people like me. The food is also awesome. Now if you're trying to lose weight, this place might be a challenge, but the soups are amazing. I love the broccoli cheddar, and the autumn squash. Both are rich, heavy soups. Neither are on any diet I know about, but they are superb. They have a great selection of baked goods as well. Coffee is excellent and you can have as many refills as you want. The washrooms are clean, which is also important. Parking is close to the restaurant."}
{"text":"I just want to walk in here one time and feel like it isn't the order takers, food assemblers, managers, and dish washers first day.

Here's a life lesson:  Panera hires inexperienced, inexpensive labor, has a process that over works them, and then they probably go work at Chipotle.  It's the cycle of life."}
{"text":"Love the southwest tortilla bowl. I miss the old Greek salad but still enjoy the food. Just wish they would use less salt since they scram \"I'm healty\""}
{"text":"Loe their you pick two. Always such a nice treat. Love to go there for lunch. Tried the noodle bowls and there were suprsiprsingly good"}
{"text":"Love Panera. ITs not the lowest in Calories but it is a good tasty stop. I tried the noodle bowl which I thought would be bad but it was super good. We usually get the you pick two and do greek salad and a bowl of soup."}
{"text":"Super thirsty after drinking the soup. :( 
Sandwich is average.  U have choice of a bag of chip or an apple for the side.  

They ran out of white cheddar that day so they gave us swiss cheese instead for the steak & white cheddar panini.  They also ran out of some kind of pepper for our chipotle chicken avocado melt."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviews, where they state that this one is less than friendly. I too have heard the manager say inappropriate things to people - in front of customers.
I also agree that the prices are too high for what you get."}
{"text":"Me and my husband stop in one of are day dates. The food was great the customer service was wonderful. This was few weeks ago. The best thing we are first time customer."}
{"text":"It has been several months since I visited Panera Bread. It is a bakery cafe chain with free WiFi. Prices are reality the same although from time to time they change their seasonal offerings.

Food is fair. You order and you are given a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready. They use real dishes and silverware. The menu gives you a calorie count of each item you are purchasing.  One of the popular feature items is you pick two where you can have half a sandwich or salad or soup in a pair of two of those items. You also get with it a choice of an apple or roll and you can add a dessert for $1.00

I was disappointed to learn they had removed the French onion soup from the menu. I asked about this removal only to learn there was something wrong with one of the ingredients. The other disappointment was that this year they are not making gingerbread men which are one of my favorite holiday treats. Instead they are offering a holiday themed sugar cookie.

I normally eat here when I'm in a hurry and don't have time to sit down at a regular restaurant. They do use fresh breads and they do cater. You can also order your holiday baked goods or breads for your parties."}
{"text":"The more I come to any Panera the more disgusted I get with it. I was under time constraints since I had an MD visit today so needed to grab a fast bite. Place wasn't overly crowded and I noticed they now serve these soup style bowls with either chicken, quinoa, or lentils in it.

I didn't want to eat too much so I ordered a vegan lentil bowl with quinoa and asked for an apple as my side. I only wanted water to drink and was given a small cup which I knew I'd have to take to the machine numerous times to stay hydrated.

I was also given the notification pad and with my thinking  go up when it lit up and I did so. It was then I learned they serve your meal when it is ready and come to you. I had my bowl a few minutes afterwards. Believe me the apple had some dark spots on it that I really didn't want to eat it. I started with my bowl and to my surprise it was not the bowl I had ordered. I crossed checked my receipt to make sure the order was taken correctly and saw that it was.  I took it back and then admitted their error and shortly after got my order. Needless to say it was fair. 

I do like the fact that they offer free WiFi here but the same concept. Once you have finished eating you take your tray to a station where you separate the china from the recycles and the trash.

Panera bread is a chain and can be a hit or miss depending upon which one you visit. It is a bakery cafe and they do post calorie counts on all their items. The place is starting to get a bit more pricey these days which is why I avoid it. This place is clean and outdoor seating is available. It sits on the end of Char Valley mall near the driver's license center. There is a rewards program with a special card but I normally don't use it."}
{"text":"Panera Bread is a nationwide chain that serves meals at all times during the day. They also have a bagel selection as well as a pastry section. You can purchase food to eat there or to go. They also do large group catering. They have free Wi Fi for your use while visiting.

They now claim that all their ingredients are natural and they have expanded the menu so it can be confusing when you look at it. This is very much true of the you pick two option. Some items may be signature items which will have more of an upcharge if you pick one or both of those items. They list the amount of calories next to their menu choices so you can plan your meal accordingly. They have now added flatbreads to their menu choices which I haven't tried yet.

They do have a private seating area you can reserve for functions. Otherwise you need to find a table and sit down once you've paid for your meal.

They also serve various coffees, hot chocolate and smoothies. You go to the counter place your order, pay for it and then you are given a buzzer to let you know it is ready.

All food is served on ceramic plates with real utensils. On this particular visit I ordered just a smoothie while my daughter chose a you pick two of a sandwich and soup combination. She got a choice of bread or an apple as a side and for $1.00 more she could get a pastry of her choice for dessert.

I enjoyed my smoothie and shared the chocolate pastry she got which was very good. She seemed to enjoy her meal. When finished you take your tray to a disposal area which consists of two bins. One is for trash and the other is for your dirty dishes. You then place your empty tray on top for the staff to clean.

Panera Bread has been constantly increasing their prices so it becomes competitive with some casual sit down restaurants. Still they have a big draw and the lines are very long. I used to enjoy their French onion soup but all they do is sprinkle grated cheese on it. Not my favorite when I can get a cheese covering elsewhere. Still they have good salads which is one of my favorites along with a sweet treat now and then."}
{"text":"Came in today for Dinner after a long day at work, was greeted by Sergio and placed an order for the pick two with BBQ Flatbread and the Lemon Orozco Soup, the flatbread was amazing, however the soup was way too salty. 

Super excited that Panera is removing artificial flavors, preservatives, and artificial colors! Will be back to see that, however some items on the menu must go!"}
{"text":"Great experience!  It was my first time at this location. The employees were kind and eager to help. I tried the chicken tortilla bowl and it was very good. The restaurant was clean and the iced tea was very fresh!"}
{"text":"I just went to Paradise Bakery and ordered a turkey, ham and salome sandwich. For $8.00 I LITERALLY received ONE piece of processed turkey, ONE piece of processed ham and ONE slice of Salome!! It wasn't even a full sandwich, it was a half. I called the manager thinking they must have made a mistake, and..... they didn't. For $8.00 you receive one slice each of processed meat and bread. To the manager's credit he said the sandwich was probably a half when it should have been a whole and he would refund my money if I were to come back to the store. However, I ordered it to-go in 107 degrees, so going back out wasn't my idea of fun. So, for $11 you too can have a small lemonade, a couple pieces of processed garbage on bread."}
{"text":"For the price and quality of food, Panera Bread can be a little disappointing for being overly pricey yet the food quality is somewhat poor. 

We used the kiosk to order two sets of meals and a bottle of green tea. When our order came out, we didn't even receive the green tea and had to go back to ask for it. My order of 1/2 grilled cheese sandwich and a cup to tomato soup was just decent tasting, edible but just barely. 

My boyfriend claimed the bag of kettle chips I got with my meal was the best tasting food, and I stayed that the bag of chips did not even taste that good. The saving grace may very well be the bottle of green tea that was initially forgotten to be served to us. Overall, for the price of almost $20 for our meal, I'd say the quality of food was quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Mom and I had a casual lunch here recently while I was in town visiting.  The place was pretty busy but they had several cashiers and the line went fast.  Mom had her usual - tomato soup with grilled cheese.  Both were very tasty.  

I had the Mediterranean Quinoa Salad with almonds - Kale, romaine, cucumbers, tomato sofrito, kalamata olives, quinoa and toasted almonds tossed with Greek dressing.  It was really tasty.  I loved all of the toppings in it.  A nice alternative to a regular salad.

I am sure we will be back as we hit up Panera quite frequently.  Its an easy, tasty lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Can't say I'm surprised by the negative reviews. For being a new location, I expected more. My experience was difficult. I attempted to place a rapid order online with a gift card. I like a good deal and with $3 off this was calling to me. Turns out, you can't pay with a gift card that does NOT have a PIN. So I drove to the actual store. I place my order which came out to $24.82. I attempted to use my gift card only to have the cashier tell me that gift cards \"crash their system.\" She attempted to run it anyway but it did not work. So we left. There were no signs posted anywhere. No alternative options were offered. Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Since it's at the waterfront, there is always somewhere to park. When you walk in there are a good amount of places to sit, but I wish there more booths because those seats fill up quick. I see a lot of people coming here with computers. The customer service is alright. During the peak of lunch while I was trying to wait to listen for my name to be called, an employee comes through to vacuum. I understand the need for a clean carpet, but there was no spill or excessive mess to be cleaned up. This seemed like it was a routine clean up, which just interrupted many people's lunchtime. Also, when I was ordering a pastry, the employee made me tell her ahead of time which pastry I wanted to get, and usually I was able to be charged for the pastry and then I have a chance to pick out whatever pastry I wanted. 
The broccoli cheddar soup is my favorite and the Thai salad was good too, but I like the southwest lime chicken more. I like that the menu includes the calories of each item."}
{"text":"I will never go to this location again.....I stopped going for about 2 years because of bad, bad, bad service, but thought I would give them another chance recently.......the service is even worse than it as before.  The staff are by far the most rude, disrespectful workers in have encountered in a long time. They actually all rolled their eyes at us for asking them to fix our sandwich that was made incorrectly........even the supervisor!!!!! Hopefuly someone in much higher management is reading this and will take a serious look at this store. They need to clean house of the ungrateful front line staff and get people that want to work!!!"}
{"text":"I came in for a simple light lunch.  I got a little quinoa and lentils about half cup of broth and an egg.  Doesn't seem like a good value for $10."}
{"text":"The slowest service every time! It's ridiculous how long  you wait in the drive thru. They need retrained!"}
{"text":"Yikes! It's been awhile since I'd visited a Panara restaurant, and was a little shocked by the final bill. We stopped after my cousin had an MRI at McGee hospital. Having had to fast from the night before, by noon after her test was finished, she was pretty famished. 

I had half a turkey and roasted kale panini and bowl of potato soup and bottled water, the cuz had a bowl of cheddar broccoli soup and half a turkey cheddar apple sandwich, bottle of water for her too. Ready? $24.35. That's insane! It's expensive to eat clean, and that's Panara's selling point. It was good, don't get me wrong, but almost $25 is a little outrageous IMO."}
{"text":"I came to Panera bread for lunch after seeing several Instagram pictures of soup in bread bowls. A bowl you can eat.. I had to try.

I was surprised at how large the establishment was when I walked in. There's a bakery display along with the cashiers talking your order with the menu overhead. The menu consisted of soups, salads and sandwiches. I opted for the \"pick two\" option and had a flat-bread chicken sandwich and garden vegetable pesto soup. The total came to $15 with a canned drink.

The food was quickly delivered to my table and the disappointment didn't take long to set in. My soup was cold and my flat bread sandwich was burnt, dry and lacked flavour. 

I don't expect to revisit this location. The $15 price tag did not reflect the food.. I could have had a better meal at Tim Hortons for half the price.

Panera bread earns two stars for the restaurant itself, friendly staff and the complimentary French baguette which was my favourite part of the meal."}
{"text":"My absolute fave experiences at Panera were here! The employees were so helpful, patient, and kind. They helped me decide what to get and encouraged me to try. And the food? Delicious! I redeemed my free daily bagel and got the Pick 2 deal. Absolutely delicious! I loved the sandwiches, pastries, and coffee. Yum! Will come again."}
{"text":"On a rainy day, a tomato soup is just what I'm craving! My friend and I were shopping all day and she told me she'd NEVER been to panera before so obviously I had to take her. 

This location is a beautiful and nice location because it's in boca park. There always seems to be a line when I go in but I don't mind it usually goes by relatively quickly. 

My food was out very quickly but for some reason my friends took a bit longer. Hmm. 

I got a delicious tomato soup on a rainy day. Yum! Hit the spot. I also tried their Mediterranean veggie sandwich for the first time. It was delicious! Highly recommended. I got it as a lettuce wrap though since I'm on a low carb diet right now. 

Pros: nice location, friendly staff, free wifi, noise level low 

Cons: sometimes too crowded, I always have a hard time finding parking at this location 

***tip: if you've never had the iced green tea from this place you're missing out!"}

A male coworker ordered a full vegetable sandwich, a soup and a lemon ice tea for lunch.  The order set him back $17, tax inclusive. 

This is probably the right amount of food for a man.  It is up to you if the cost is reasonable for a sandwich lunch."}
{"text":"VERY disappointed with the service I just received at this location. I placed a mobile order that was supposed to be ready at 11:14 consisting of a flatbread and a half salad. I arrive at 11:10 and stand by the rapid pick up cabinet until 11:25 watching as orders placed after mine were filled. I then ask a work to check on my order. She comes back and says they are out of flatbread. The system needs to be fixed in an instance like this. No one approached me, no calls to my number, nothing regarding my order being unable to be filled. Instead, they just let me stand there waiting for an order that was never going to come out. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan. I like the layout of this one. I would like however if they could look at repairing the upholstery in a couple of the booths. clean old food off the walls of the booths. Love my sandwich and soup combination and yes I will return. Maybe this time sitting by the window. LOL"}
{"text":"Love this place and this is the newest location here in wonderful Boca Park!  This one is larger than most of the other Paneras and the staff is extra friendly.  Other than that, the menu is the same as all Paneras.  We love the bread bowls, sandwiches and acai berry iced tea."}
{"text":"I completely disagree with the 1 star reviews from bad people with nothing better to do then complain about service and food they don't receive that they think they deserve. I eat at Panera all the time and always get a good meal, service,Fresh good food and nice environment. Keep doing what you do."}
{"text":"Luv this place! !! I wish Panera was in Phoenix Arizona.  Soups are all awesome,  bread is fresh and the sandwich are amazing. My go to spot when I can find one."}
{"text":"Yummy breads, sweet rolls, soups, sandwiches, coffee/latte, bagels. Can't complain! Even prettty tasty almond quinoa oatmeal! On one visit, I stopped for breakfast because I had an early morning appointment and needed breakfast. Was hoping to get something a little healthier than just starchy bread, and saw the quinoa oatmeal. I was actually pretty excited, and happen to hear behind me two girls talking. One of them says to the other \"almond quinoa oatmeal... who comes to Panera and orders that??\" they giggle, and what do I do? I order that oatmeal. Ha, kind of funny to hear their reaction. Thank you Panera for offering that option! Woot, woot!"}
{"text":"Panera is always consistent with their food and their catering. The quality of food  for their  prices I feel is excellent. This location is not too busy and very easy to get in and out of quickly. I just stopped on for a quick bowl of tomato soup while running errands. I love that they give you a huge hunk of baguette with your soups. Fast food is so lousy for you, I feel much better when I eat here when I'm on the go."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the staff is fairly nice in person and the food is always good, but they mess up my order a lot. I've had to get in the habit of looking through every single thing they put in my bag, because it seems if I don't, I get home and find something is missing. I'll call and tell them, because I want my money back for the item I didn't receive, and both times they have offered some sort of payback. 

First, they forgot a fruit cup, so they said they would give me a free one next time I came in. The person on the phone said they'd put my name on the manager's list. I go in and they have no idea what I'm talking about. They gave me an entree for free, which was totally great of them.

Second time, when I do rapid order pick up, I get there and have to wait around for 10 minutes before my order is even ready (even though I came in 5 minutes after it was set to be done) and rush out the door to get food home for me and my boyfriend and they forgot the dessert. I called again, they said they could give me two free desserts; again I was told that my name would be put on a list. Go in a little while later and, again, they have no clue what I'm talking about.

If another Panera were closer, I'd go to that one because I've never had this issue with another Panera. I understand mistakes happen, I worked in the food industry, but that doesn't make it any less annoying. So, just a reminder for everyone to check their bags if they do Rapid Pick Up at this location."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was just my lucky day, but this is the best Panera I've been to so far. And it's in a rest stop! 

Seriously, this place was incredibly clean. Any my sandwich was awesome. You know sometimes they hastily throw your to-go sandwich together, knowing that it won't fall apart until you try to open it in the car and are too lazy to go back in? That is not the case here. My sandwich was built with care and perfectly wrapped. They even included a pickle! Totally made my day."}
{"text":"I live 1.6 miles from this location. They  changed their delivery route and will no longer deliver to my home. Such a bad decision."}
{"text":"Lunch at Panera.   Ordered steak and cheese sandwich and a side of Mac & cheese.   Sandwich was cold and was more like a bread and nothing.  See picture.  

Mac & cheese was also cold.   Attempted to return food and give Panera a chance to fix the issues.   No one was willing to list or help

Posting the following 3 weeks later.    Interesting management made no comment to try and improve.    I would bet current manager will be looking for a job soon"}
{"text":"Way over priced. Were out of almost every cookie type except for some undercooked chocolate chip. Remember when this place used to be the golf standard for chocolate chip cookies? Me neither."}
{"text":"Three stars just because they are not consistent at all and because of their delivery policy. 

It's Panera so the food is pretty good overall. Sometimes, portions look questionable. Sometimes I get huge portions and at times I will get a super small portion of I'm eating in the restaurant. Also, there was a point where I had to double check my pick up order every time down to the fork and spoon because it would be consistently incorrect.

The price point is somewhat reasonable. I always get the pick 2 or the pasta meal which is always filling and worth the price. 

-1 star because I was delivered an incorrect item. I suggested to management that the driver either return with the corrected item and I could return the incorrect item (exchange like other delivery places) or get some type of credit to my account. The manager on duty was not accommodating at all. I could understand if it was a pick-up, but if I get a delivery, what's the point of having to go to the store to have my food made that way I suggested while still having tipped and paid a delivery fee. 

The inside is typically clean. There are always people working on their laptops and not eating anything, but it doesn't phase me unless there are no open spots which is rare. The layout is kind of odd though. You have to walk and maneuver through tables to get to the register area.

I still eat here because they deliver to my home and because of the reward program. I prefer the University location much more."}
{"text":"Horrible food. My daughter ordered chicken noodle soup which came in a bowl that was half empty and had scant actual food in the broth. It had very few pieces of chicken and a few noodles. She basically ate bread soaked in chicken broth. I had a \"whole sandwich\". This was basically a child's size serving. I paid over $19. Very frustrated with this place. I'm not sure why I gave it a second chance. This place has to be going bankrupt. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Where to begin with this Panera location! Oh my. I love Panera and go there often for lunch, coffee, and for a place to study. I'm usually very satisfied with my meal and service, even though I think that the company overprices their items. 

However, my family and I had a HORRIBLE experience at this location. We went there for lunch, and the restaurant was mostly full with students studying. The only table open was one close to the back near the bathrooms. Typically, this wouldn't be issue, but at this location, it was. My father went into the men's bathroom and commented that it was the grossest bathroom he had ever seen in his life. We told one of the workers about the bathroom, and she proceeded to prop the men's door open to clean it. Given that we were at the table by the bathroom, the smell was horrendous and making all of us gag. My mother then asked the worker to close the door because we were going to be eating, and she rolled her eyes and didn't do it. At this point, we were already having a horrible experience, so we called the manager over. We told her what was happening, and she couldn't care less. She offered no help, and the bathroom door STILL was not closed. 

After all this, we received our food. I had ordered a full caesar salad and cup of soup. There were about two chopped pieces of romaine lettuce in my salad, and my cup of soup was half full. Once again, we called the manager over to ask about the portions, and she said she was \"just the manager\" and couldn't do anything about it. DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION! Rude, inconsiderate workers who don't care that customers are paying $50 for a lunch for 3 people."}
{"text":"Vastly improved since first opened. Clean. Nice. Not so crazy as Arboretum. Spacious and servers courteous. Keep it up. Great g
Food!"}
{"text":"Really sad that they don't give out cookies with the pick 2 sandwiches like Paradise. I ordered on the computer that they have near the entrance and somehow got charged for chips once we received our to go order. Service was slow- only one person ahead of us and it took 20 minutes to get our half sandwich, soup, and half salad. The bread rolls are usually hard. I wish they stayed a Paradise instead of Panera."}
{"text":"I was here Sunday morning (today).  Manager seemed like she was overwhelmed and in process not taking good care of the customers. I asked for 2 coffees and sandwiches. She gives me to go cups for coffee. I said I wanted mugs. She says, \"well, you did not ask for them\". Then throws the perfectly fine to go cups in garbage in front of me with an attitude. She half listened and gave wrong bakery item, threw that one in garbage too. It was not eve in front of the counter yet. She could have put it back. They ran out of almost all the soufflés. Overall I like Panera bread but will not return to this location."}
{"text":"The food is always the same but when I went to this location and used the restroom, I was so put off, the food didn't even taste good.(even though it's always the same) The restrooms were so dirty! And I'm not talking about a busy day kinda of dirty - I'm talking about the, never been cleaned from the floor up, (ever) kinda a dirty! So gross to use a restroom that filthy and then go eat your food! It makes you wonder how they maintain the rest of the restaurant?"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 bagles toasted, we come home to find them both burnt on one side, mostly black. We called to complain and the manager said to say a password to get 2 free bagels in our next return. So we did that in our next visit, but wouldn't accept it since we had no receipt. They did not mention on the call to bring a receipt with us. Bad customer service. I refuse to give them more of my money, Ended up going down the street to Dunkin Donuts for my bagels, just because of the experience I had with them. Will not return."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Service was horrible. It took thirty minutes for a salad and half of a sandwich. And they didn't even get the food right."}
{"text":"Am I the only one who feels this place has gone down?  The last 2 x I went I have been disappointed.  The first time because they changed their breakfast preparation and got the order wrong twice.  This time food was wrong and not well prepared.  But worst of all this is what I observed.  Food handlers not wearing gloves and using their cell phones before and after they prepared the food.  Also one employee was carrying loaves of bread basically resting it on her chest with her ear buds dangling and hitting the bread.  eeeewww.  I feel the manager is not doing well.  The place was very dirty in the food prep area.  I am done.  Not going back.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to see all new menu items. It had been a while since I visited a store. I was impressed. I chose a Caesar Salad, but I wanted to try the oatmeal lol. Salad was good portion great price, fresh, and quite a few pieces of chicken. Even though parking was a little hectic the line inside moved fast and my food was prepared quickly. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was alright, I think it's better quality at the Trop & Fort Apache location. This review is mostly for the service I received. Shanterial was super sweet, very attentive and just overall a pleasure. She gets 5+ stars!!! As we all know, good service is rare to come by these days but she knows how to take care of her customers."}
{"text":"The food here is good. The kids behind the counter will modify anything you want. They're pretty quick and efficient. The issue with this place is that it's so dirty. Like really dirty. It drives me nuts when I come in on back-to-back days and see the same pieces of food under a table that were there the day before. The chairs are really dusty around the bottoms -- I know you don't sit on that part, but it's so noticeable. I don't think they ever clean the benches of the booths either. So much food and crumbs stuck around them. I've learned to get my own toilet paper out of the cupboard in the bathroom, since the stalls are usually out.

Paradise: Each night, tables need to be moved and swept and mopped under. Bench booths need to be lifted and cleaned. Chairs need to be dusted. Someone needs to be assigned each shift to check the bathrooms at least once an hour. This is restaurant 101. Can't believe management doesn't notice this stuff. Your guests are."}
{"text":"Why all the hatin' on Panera?!?! Being from the east coast, Panera bread is nearly as common as a Dunkin or Honey Dew Donuts. Welcome to the Desert Panera! As I understand it, Panera bought out Arizona's Paradise Bakery years ago. The menus and recipes are the same now.

What is handy dandy about this brand new store is that pretty much every single seat has an outlet. For fellow laptop folks like me, we love places that give us power AND Wifi (usually it's one or the other). 

I'm sure they were working out some training issues in the beginning, but the staff is super nice and tries really hard."}
{"text":"I am a definite Panera fan and typically enjoy the Broccoli Cheese Soup, because it is the best.  However, today I decided to switch it up and order a Turkey Bacon Sandwich on Sourdough and a cup of Chicken Noodle Soup. The sandwich was fresh, although the bacon could have been cooked a little more.. As for the soup, just right! The broth was light and the carrots, celery and chicken were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of noodles.  My Mom enjoyed the new strawberry salad with chicken and loved it!  The baguette on the side was a definite bonus, cooked perfectly!
I am not a frequent customer at this location, and did enjoy the new kiosks for debit and credit card orders, but the place was packed and the tables are definitely a little tight. Be prepared to wait around lunch time, but in mind it is worth it."}
{"text":"The Soups draw me in, especially the Broccoli Cheese and Black Bean. They are amazing and come with a side (chips, apple, or bread), which I suggest ordering the side of bread. It is a nice piece of a baguette, perfect for dipping.
Unfortunately this location is very limited in parking and during lunch seems to be overwhelming. Although good, be prepared to take a few extra minutes to park and wait in the LONG line, as thing seems to be a convenient hot stop, in Myers Park, for many area businesses."}
{"text":"On a chilly day, Panera's soup calls my name. I decided to order a cup of broccoli cheese soup and turkey and Swiss on sourdough. The sandwich was great and the soup definitely hit the spot. I love the pieces of broccoli and carrots, a lot thicker than some other places. Only disappointing factor, service. There were over 10-15 people in line with one girl at the register and two kiosks for self serve orders. And, delivery of the orders seemed to be slow and I originally received the wrong soup. No worries, will be back."}
{"text":"I am a Panera fan, but have only been to this location a few times, as I am not in the area that often.  Upon arrival we noticed the new fall/winter menu items so decided to order the Turkey and Cranberry sandwich, only to be told they were out of Cranberry. Really? That was a little disappointing, but with so many menu items my friend was able to pick something else.  I chose the you pick two, soup and sandwich, Chicken & Wild Rice Soup, yum!

We dined in and received a number card, to be placed on out table. 
Note: If you plan to dine in arrive early around lunch, as it gets pretty crowded.  
In less than 10 minutes our food was delivered and was warm, fresh and 
delicious. And, our \"server\", if that is what you want to call the girl who delivered our dishes, was so sweet and even grabbed me a side of mayo and a knife.  She had a smile on her face the entire time.
Panera Bread caters to everyone, offering salads, soups, sandwiches, paninis, and baked good, which you get a baked for for $.99 with any order, definite bonus!"}
{"text":"I love this Panera.  Even when it is crowded, the service is quick and it is cleaner than other Panera locations I have been to.  The drive thru is very convenient!"}
{"text":"I spend a lot of time studying here. Tonight I had an experience that really bothered me. There's a ton of employees walking around and there were only 3 or 4 other people in the building. I stood up front to order for over 5 minutes before someone came over. A woman saw I was there and said \"oh I didn't know you were out here\" and walked completely past me to do something at the drink station. She ended up cutting her finger and bleeding...so I'm ordering...she proceeds to suck on her bleeding finger as I'm ordering. Not only that, she handed me my buzzer with the hand that was bleeding and goes \"I don't know what I hit my hand on that made me cut it\".  

I ordered an iced latte and they brought me out a hot one. So I said, I ordered an iced latte not a hot one. She goes, \"want me to bring you a cup of ice?\"   

I paid $14 for half a bowl of soup, half sandwhich and a latte. I liked it a lot more and didn't mind paying when it was Paradise Bakery but the food is NOT worth the amount of money that is spent here...at all.

Honestly- if it wasn't one of the only places open on Easter Sunday, I wasn't starving and wasn't in the midst of my finals this week, I would've left. I won't come back."}
{"text":"Panera is always good for their U-Pick-2 option, as well as their bakery choices.  I usually go for salad and soup with tonight's choice for dinner being their Power Spinach salad and Bistro Onion soup--the combo looked good on the giant picture behind the cash registers. The first thing I noticed when I walked in, though, was the red velvet cookies--hmmm, those are new.  And, as you can see, sugar plays such an important role in my diet that I'm drawn to the baked goods first.  Armed with my Panera Rewards card, I had the salad, soup, a small fountain drink and said red velvet cookie, all for $9.66 (I got $2 off the meal because I had rewards on my card)--not bad, dude.  If I can spend $10 or less on a decent dinner, I'm a happy camper."}
{"text":"the cheese, spinach & artichoke souffle is really crispy, flaky, and crunchy from the outer crusts to the soft, melted cheese and the veggies towards the center. almost similar to a Vietnamese pastry called banh pate so.. it's very good while it is still hot/warm.  definitely will get it again.  i guess it's first come, first service. 

also tried the pumpkin bagel,  it is sweet..the veggies spread tone down the sweet.  or maybe I'm just not used to the pumpkin favor. 

frozen caramel is good.  i usually get this when i need a pick me up sugar cold drink rush to start my day. frozen  mocha is very chocolaty,  good for whoever loves chocolate."}
{"text":"The only real issue regarding Panera Bread is that you can get cheaper meals elsewhere.
Dropped in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. I ordered the 2 for 1 meal....2 choices from either: soup, 1/2 café sandwich or a café salad. I ordered the Turkey chili (I added 2 packets of hot sauce to it to take it up a few notches but it was excellent) and the turkey sandwich (excellent as well....turkey, red onions, lettuce), and pop. Meal also included a bag of Panera potato chips. 
Dining companion ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich (it was excellent) which also included a bag of Panera Potato chips, and a pop
We decided to split a brownie for dessert. It was very dry but had a rich chocolate flavour.
Total cost for both meals came in at just under $28.
The cashier was very friendly...didn't get her name but she was wearing a tag that said she was the Shift Manager.
Place was fairly quiet but décor was nice and the store is bigger than it appear from the outside.
I'd go back again."}
{"text":"I like Panera....but I often visit the one in Vaughan as its closer to home.
The food is fresh(er) than similar style restaurants, although that freshness comes at a premium.
Anyways, I popped in here last week for a sandwich and was told that it \"wasn't available\", which left me scrambling to reorder. Ended up with something I wouldn't normally get, but I'll admit it was pretty good.
Staff were friendly, if non-descript (no-one stood out).
I'd go back if in the neighbourhood again."}
{"text":"Had to send salad back and the silverware was dirty, lost apititate and left. Was concerned about even going because of the workers that are out front protesting the business."}
{"text":"Soup is my pleasure food! With that being said, the rest of the family loves their sandwiches!

This particular one is closet to our home.So if we eat at Paradise this is the one we go to. 

The cleanliness of the store is good. Tables are always clean and kept up. Bathroom is clean and stocked.  

Soup is normally good, unfortunately the bread bowls leave a lot to be desired :(

Two out of three times the bread is stale.

Sandwiches are good, Mac and Cheese is wonderful!"}
{"text":"We came in for the Pick 2. Had onion soup and plain turkey. We were charged $22! For the \"gourmet\" price they could have at least cut up the apple on the plate! Not coming back. I can get a really nice meal served at my table for $22"}
{"text":"I used to love the Greek salad here, but then one time ... something in the dressing recipe must've changed or I got food poisoning. No known food allergies here, but midway through my lunch and my tongue started tingling, I had a hard time swallowing and then I bolted to the bathroom where I proceeded to empty the contents of my stomach (I'll leave it at that). The rest of the afternoon was spent in bed, with frequent trips to the bathroom. Unspecified food allergy? Food poisoning? I have no idea. I just know that I used to be able to eat at Panera and then *BAM* now I can't. Or rather, I won't. Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"Just had the souffle. Frikkin incredible. How can a chain staffed by hapless undergrads turn out such a heavenly food item? I'm no expert in the field of French egg dishes, but i doubt i'll ever eat one much better for that price. Now, it may even be from a frozen food service if i know my chains. But i don't care. It made my day. The coffee is not that great though. Can't wait to sit out front come the nice weather."}
{"text":"I miss Paradise Bakery so much! This is nothing like it and such a disappointment.  More expensive, smaller portions and poor quality.  I really wanted my favorite stand by soup and salad, ice tea and the chippers.  I used the kiosk to order which was confusing and took forever. I ordered the pick two with chicken and wild rice soup.  the soup was still delicious.  I thought I ordered the garden salad which I wanted with ranch like Paradise used to have.  they didn't have ranch so I chose the southwest ranch and minus the onion.  the salad came out with onions, didn't have tomato like the menu said so it just left the greens and cucumber.  the greens was more kale than anything. which with southwest ranch was gross.  I didn't eat it.  I didn't see on the kiosk menu that chippers were an option even though I saw them behind the glass, I ordered the chocolate cookie.  it was very \"chewy\" like taffy.  the ice tea was good.  this whole meal was over $12. I won't go back."}
{"text":"It's Panera Bread, nothing too surprising other than the ridiculously crowded parking lot during the business lunch rush.  It just goes to show you how hard up the South Park area is for a great sandwich shoppe.  

Don't expect to be wow'd here, it's pretty straight forward.  The outside seating area is pretty nice even though its directly positioned on the busy Fairview road.

About the best feature of this place is the scenery if ya catch my drift ;-)"}
{"text":"I came here before work and put my order in at 5:34. My order was ready at 5:48. They were out of bananas, so I couldnt have my strawberry banana smoothie. I personally think that if you are trying to promote rapid check out or fast lane check out, especially if you have a drive-through, then the food should be getting prepared faster than 12 minutes. I had ordered the you pick to so half of a strawberry poppyseed salad and half of a turkey bravo sandwich. At the end when the guy gave me my food, I had to doublecheck and look for my smoothie. He even forgot to put in the chips. However, he did apologize for the long wait. It is not a convenient time frame for people who are going through the drive-through or coming into the store and waiting for their food. I was going into work after. So I was getting anxious about the time. I don't know if this is the proper standard for time for Panera. Kinda crappy experience for my first time at this Panera. The quality of the sandwich was OK. The salad was good as usual."}
{"text":"I'm gonna miss this place when it turns to a Panera. I won't be going here anymore once that happens."}
{"text":"Love the express pick up option! It's super easy and removes the burden of waiting in line. The food is pretty good for your run of the mill sandwich / salad grab and go spot. The \"pick 2\" is always my choice. Perfect amount of food and gives you a little variety."}
{"text":"To be honest food here is not bad and it's healthy for ya.

I just think that the food is way overpriced. 11 -15 for their pick 2 menu is ridiculous especially when you get half a sandwich.

Staff is nice for sure.  I would only eat here if someone paid for me."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience, first time using this location. I placed an order online for a bagel box - waited around for ten minutes after it was to be ready when I was finally asked what I ordered. Come to find out they didn't have any of the types of bagels I requested. Why not call me or let me not Place the order? Why let me stand around? No sorry. Ended up having to order expensive pastries from the counter after standing in line, and now I'm late for work."}
{"text":"Middle of the road as far as Panera is concerned. The employees are mainly friendly. However, this store always seems to fail at making sure the beverage station is stocked. There are time when there are no lids or straws or beverages canisters are empty. Also keep in mind that this location does not have rapid pick-up options, ordering from your table, or the in-store kiosks where you can avoid standing in line like nearly every other Panera I'm familiar with in Phoenix. There is plenty of room to retrofit the store to add these features."}
{"text":"This place is apathetic at best. Employees have the I don't give a care about customer service. The salad I had had a metal brush thread innit and when identified to the employee, she brought it to her manager who never even bothered to come talk to me. I have given this place many chances and the only thing that is consistent is it fails miserably to impress me. Especially when the employees empty out the iced coffee in front of me for their own consumption and then just walk away with it empty. I had to ask to have more made. And when they made more, my meal was done. If I owned this place a major change in management would occur quickly to maintain the customer base I can maintain. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Panera of Concord NC has a pleasant atmosphere and food is good. It's a little pricey, but a nice place to bring the family."}
{"text":"Ordered my food at 7:43 I arrive there and head to the rapid pickup and was supposed to be done by 7:53. I waited until 8:13 and said enough waiting, so I go up to the front counter and ask if they even got my order. The cashier was like yeah the bread bowl correct? I'm like yes I've been waiting 20 minutes and she didn't say anything about my wait didn't add on something to at least acknowledge I was very upset that I had to wait for one bread bowl soup. I didn't mind that they were out of dinner rolls but don't email saying wait for your order at the rapid pick up if it's not going to be there."}

{"text":"A Panera is a Panera. The staff was pleasant enough.\" Clean\" seating areas and pretty good sized too. 

The event that sticks in my head, other than the staff loudly complaining that they wanted to go home at 4 when they had come in at the crack of dawn (10), is this: One of the employees was asked to wipe the mud and salt off the legs of the tables. She proceeds to do so but also wipes the table tops with the same rag. Gross."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff who were all smiles, stocked showcases, clean restrooms and not a long wait...and this was at the beginning of the lunch rush. Ordered Bistro French Onion Soup (nomnomnom) and an iced coffee to go. The wait wasn't long and the soup was hot and delicious. The iced coffee was smooth according to hubby. 

This is probably the best Panera that I have been to in regards to staff and cleanliness. I have found Panera to be consistent on food quality to be excellent and delicious across the board."}
{"text":"Lunchtime was busy, but there were still plenty of tables to choose from. The line was long, but I ordered at the kiosks off to the left side of the registers and avoided the queue all together.The process was quick and self explanatory and was actually nicer, as you can see images of all the items as you review the menu. 

I ordered the Spicy Thai salad. I got the whole size and it was very large. Lots of chicken and just the right amount of vinaigrette dressing and peanut sauce on top. I personally didn't find the salad spicy, just well seasoned. I would order it again, but perhaps the half size and get something else along with it. The baguette I was served with it was soft and still warm. 

The restaurant overall could have used a walk through from a cleaning point of view. There was debris on the floor, tables, chairs - a staff member just needed to walk through and tidy things up from the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Scottie displayed great Customer service & the menu was unique and refreshing. Great bread selections - and try the soup menu too."}
{"text":"This review is about the delivery service. I enjoy leaving my office for lunch but have had to stay in recently. I decided to use my Panera app and order online. The online ordering system is really easy to use, but you need to be precise on your order. My first experience ordering online was a breeze and I received everything I asked for. The only downfall was that the Mango smoothie I ordered did not taste completely blended. I let it go and moved on. I then ordered online a second time, same exact order and I am not sure what happened, but it wasn't great. The salad I ordered was loaded with bacon bits which I did not order. Don't get me wrong, there is a time and a place for bacon but I am trying to eat healthier so having my salad LOADED with bacon bits was not what I wanted or needed. The second problem was I did not receive my Mango smoothie. Lost a Star! I called right away and finally someone answered. I explained what had happened, and the woman told me the smoothie would be on it's way. Great! Within about 10 minutes, the smoothie arrived. Again, disappointing and not blended properly. All I could taste was orange juice.....this is supposed to be a MANGO smoothie. Just about the time I finished my lunch another smoothie was delivered. WOW! Really nice of Panera to provide me with two smoothies but even the third one stunk, again not blended and very watery. I am not sure who is making the smoothies at this location, but I think they need to attend a class in The Art of Making a Smoothie or take lessons from the location in Boca Park as their Mango Smoothies are simply the best!

As for the cafe, it is just like all the others but this location is very convenient to where I work so I have been in a few times. I like the Panera products but the delivery service needs to make sure that all orders are correct and not include random ingredients that the customer didn't order."}
{"text":"lol I ordered a cafe latte and the guy consulted a flipbook on how to make it and then gave me a cup of hot milk

Normally Panera is fine. I've been to it in California and Florida, and it's very decent (I'd give them four stars--this review is for the Lakewood Panera only). But whaaaat is going on at this location? It's staffed by teenage zombies who don't know how to make coffee (REALLY? DO YOU THINK BY STEAMING MILK IT TURNS TO COFFEE OR SOMETHING? CAN YOU WALK ON WATER, TOO?). They also gave me a to-go order when I told them I was eating in. And didn't inform me that I could add a desserty type thing to my order. How dare you fail to inform me of my desserty-type-thing rights!

But their wifi is working well enough for me to leave this review, so, you know. Star there."}
{"text":"Just remember these words: Jalapeno cheddar bagel breakfast sandwich is the bomb.  Im still dreaming about it. Oh how I wish there was a panera in new orleans!  
 The iced coffee regular size with free refills was also very good. The cheese danish was as good as it gets but the sandwich really stood out and is the best breakfast sandwich ive ever had in my LIFE.  I will be stalking Panera locations from now on."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love Panera and was so excited to have a Panera closer to Mountains Edge. That excitement swiftly turned into complete disappointment after dining there. When I walked in, I immediately noticed the abundance of machines to do your ordering and was not a fan. I went to the counter and insisted that someone take my order. I immediately overheard a woman complaining that her chicken and wild rice soup (my favorite) had undercooked/raw vegetables in it and was not up to par. I changed my order to the Fugi Apple Salad. When my salad arrived, there was a long black hair in the salad. It was horrible. It has literally made me not want to go back to ANY Panera, it was that bad! I would give this place negative stars if I could. If you want Panera, go to the one on Tropicana instead."}
{"text":"Panera is always excellent and this location is no exception. The dining room is clean and the staff is friendly and courteous. The only downside is the size of the dining area and the lack of meeting room area. At busier times it can be hard to get a seat. Can't beat the efficiency of carry out food if you use the kiosks or order ahead with the app."}
{"text":"Panera - any location you go, it's basically the same. Frankly, I think that the soups are much better than their salads. $10 for soup and salad isn't that great of a deal when there are much better quality salads for a few bucks less elsewhere. 

This location can get pretty busy at random times and the line can be a bit hectic. The place is clean, the service is great but to be honest, the food is really boring to me."}
{"text":"This is the worst Panera I have ever been to. I frequently visit Panera, sometimes 3 times a week. I work near the Independence Panera and can't ever recall an issue there. I live near this Panera, so I end up there often. I have had nonstop issues with this Panera. They vary from packing or giving me the wrong thing, quality of the food is poor (brown lettuce, brown avocado, mushy vegetables/fruit, watered down soup, pieces of bread that are as hard as a rock, or that are at best 2 inches long), and now a sandwich with a long hair directly in the middle of it. It looks like someone recently had the same problem, so this appears to be a pattern. I've brought this to their attention before and it was dismissed with only an apology and when brought to the attention of their owners, ignored. I've worked in food service and the hospitality industry for many years, what goes on at this Panera is unacceptable. It's absurd to think that you are paying for quality with Panera, when I think I have had better quality and experience at much cheaper fast food drive thru's."}
{"text":"I work really close to this location so I frequently do the rapid pick-up. The rapid pick-up allows you to order your food online and choose what time you what to pick it up. Usually when I do this it's ready for me right when I walk in and I'm in and out in a minute. The only problem I have is recently there have been a lot of orders that have been incorrect. I would say about 50% of the time something is missing from an order. I recommend you check your bag whenever you do take out from here just to make sure you have everything you ordered. My office did a large order a few weeks ago and had to go back because a lot of items were missing. I've never had this issue at other locations but maybe it's because this is a busier one? Just check your bag before you leave!"}
{"text":"Paradise Bakery can usually satisfy anyone's lunch cravings.  Between sandwiches, salads and soups they have quite the selection.  This spot also offers a wide variety of beverages and pastries and has tons of seating, indoors and outside.

Our group offered a wide variety of items and everything was fresh and flavorful.  The cookies were delicious and the iced coffee was pleasantly strong in flavor and refreshing.  Service could have been a bit more friendly but otherwise a great visit."}
{"text":"Stopped by here a few days ago in the afternoon to pick up our favorite cinnamon crunch bagels for breakfast...sorry, we are out of bagels???  Really?

Headed out first thing this morning for breakfast bagels... sorry, we don't have hazelnut spread, would you like honey walnut?  Yes please.  (Then, after a search of all possible hiding places in the store) sorry, we're out of honey walnut, is plain okay?  Seriously?

Also, cobblestones were conspicuously absent.

The Arizona Paradise Bakery to Panera transition doesn't seem to be working so well.  Fortunately there are a couple of other Paneras in this area so we'll keep trying to find a cinnamon crunch w/hazelnut, cobblestone, hazelnut coffee dispensary that meets the standards we've enjoyed from Panera for the past 15 years."}
{"text":"Sitting in the restaurant right now.... had the most mayonnaise laden tuna salad I have ever had.  It actually dripped off the bread.  The bread bowl that my dining partner got was cold and hard... inedible, really.   We will never be back... $20 very poorly spent."}
{"text":"First off let me just say the service was slow. It took 15 minutes just to get a sandwich and a smoothie. The smoothie was horribly mixed......NOT worth $4+. Other than that the food was not bad at all."}
{"text":"The bread on my turkey sandwich was great . The menu is a bit overwhelming if its your first time i did not know what to order. I had the tortilla soup too. Service is quick and the sandwich is good its a little pricey for what you get about 9.50 for a half sandwich and soup and a drink."}
{"text":"Okay here's the deal. I work near this place and generally I'm to lazy in the morning to make a lunch, so I end up here probably once a week. My review is completely based on going at lunch time as I can't recall ever heading there after 3pm.

The food is good, but it's a chain, so most likely you've been to one before and you know what your getting before you walk in the door. If you've never been, def give the cookies a go as it's what made them famous in the first place.

I tend to see the same employees there all the time, and I've been going for awhile now. Places with low employee turn over usually seem to have better customer service, and this one is no exception. The staff is friendly and courteous and the food is well prepared and presented.

The place loses stars  however for it's handling of customers as others have mentioned. I can't really imagine a worse way to corral customers then the set up they currently have. Only want soup? Enjoy waiting in line behind everyone else that wants a sandwich or salad before you make it up there. This seems to be compounded by the fact they have three cash registers, and yet I hardly ever see more then one actually open at any time, even when the line is out the door.

But despite this, if your not in a hurry and you want good food, Paradise is always a safe bet."}
{"text":"I find Panera to be a pretty consistent place to get a good lunch no matter where you are, but this is the location closest to me, so the one I frequent most often. 

I find the staff can be hit or miss, but most of the time they are very friendly and knowledgeable. The girls working the register today were very nice and could easily answer questions about what was in this or that item. Meals are generally pretty quick here too, so you can easily be in and out in 30 minutes, which for a sit down meal is pretty good I think. 

I love their soups here and today I got the broccoli soup in a bread bowl, with a side of more bread. Craving carbs, lol, and while both breads were good, the side of bread was much tastier than the bowl I think. The broccoli soup is always yummy. 

As far as food, I have never had a bad meal here. My hubby is so-so on it but I think that is because he is more of a burger guy. If you like soups, salads, and sandwiches, you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. We have also come for bagels in the morning which are great and I have taken bread home (asiago loaf) which is delicious. 

All in all, a great place  to eat that feels much healthier than a fast food alternative in about the same amount of time and price."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, since it was the first time we order from the lunch menu we asked the cashier questions about what's in the soba bowl, the cashier, Robin, was very rude and acted like she cannot understand me when I placed my order. Don't eat here unless you want to be treat like an idiot."}
{"text":"Great food, always fresh and consistent.  This location is packed, but the new digital ordering at the entrance is a great time saver, though I wish you got a receipt then.  You pick 2 is my favorite - greek salad and Cesar salads with a sandwich is my favorite, and their bread is great, always fresh."}
{"text":"This location is great! Love to hang out on the patio and people watch shoppers at Boca Park.  They also have great customer service and friendly staff.  Coffee is always stocked.  The weekend can be busy at breakfast and lunch time."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Panera. Let my two friends go order while I looked over the menu. The table was dirty, so my friend that had already ordered went to tell someone to clean the table. He came to clean and left the table soaking wet!!!
Ran into another friend who was in front of me. She went to sit with the others while I ordered a half chicken Caesar salad and a cup of water. 
Everyone got their orders and were way more than halfway through before I got my salad. With no dressing!!!
And almost $7 for a half salad???? 
Never again at Panera."}
{"text":"I found this place to be so confusing!! I might be the only person on Earth who had never been to Panera before, so this was my first time.

The ordering process just seemed weird...there were so many windows and it seemed like it was confusing (I could just be an idiot). I found the menu to be a bit overwhelming as well. I decided to order the sandwich combo with macaroni and cheese, since I'd heard so many good things about it. My ham and cheese was good, but the mac n cheese was runny and not that great. It was not worth the price.

There were also not really good instructions on how I would be getting my food. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to pick it up, or whether it was going to be delivered to me. Turns out, it was delivered (along with the utensils). The drink station is in a really awkward place and the dining room itself is really closed off.

I just found the entire experience to be strange. Although my food was OK, I won't be in any rush to go back. Sorry, Panera. I'm just not that in to you."}
{"text":"I drove here specifically because they are listed as a vendor who accept Google pay. I'm wasn't carrying any cash with me unfortunately. The sign on all of their cash registers says that they accept Apple pay and Google pay so I placed my order. However, I found out that they do not accept it. that was an out-of-the-way drive for absolutely nothing."}
{"text":"First time customer. Sandwich is ridiculously skimpy. See photo. My coworker had a salad which she said was fine.  Very disappointed after all of the advertising media hype. They need to be spending less money on advertising and more money on actual food. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I called last week to inquirer about a cookie cake.. I have previously ordered several chocolate chip cookie cakes from Paradise Bakery and was told that Panera bakes theirs the same and are just as delicious ... Wrong...The cookie cakes from
Paradise were always decorated so pretty and tasted so fresh and moist .. This cake looked as though a child decorated it and the it tasted like the person who baked it did not have a recipe and just winged it!!  It was so dry and decorated so sloppy ... No more Panera for me.."}
{"text":"The only reason I'd give this place 2 stars is because the cashier was nice ..... They brought the wrong food twice ..... The food we did order was not very good and I had an open bottle of water served to me that wasn't sealed ...... When I exchanged it the lady rolled her eyes ..... After eating what we decided was just ok to salvage we wanted to try a pastry ..... I have allergies and asked of the ingredients to a cherry tart (they have a book with a list of all ingredients) I was told she had no idea and that they come how they come . (Thanks for checking the book ) we just left and won't be returning ."}
{"text":"I like Panera Bread and I especially like Panera Bread's that have driven-throughs but out of the three times I've ordered breakfast from here, twice were gross. This is a fairly new Panera Bread and the only one I've ever ordered breakfast from but Idk what happens between assembling the breakfast sandwich and then grilling it (like, they put the entire sandwich in the panini press) but somewhere along the line, a thin slimy film of I'm assuming butter or oil develops inside the bagel and it's repulsive. I ordered the steak breakfast bagel first so I thought it was from some moisture in the steak or even from whatever the cooked the steak in (Idk how this works, guys) but my second trip here I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese on a sesame bagel and it had that same film. Maybe it's just me? It has a bitter taste to it and gave both of my breakfast sandwiches an express ticket to the garbage because I couldn't. So now I just steer clear of their breakfast sandwiches and only order their bagels. Other than that, service is always friendly and there's never a line in the drive-through so I don't mind coming here once in a while on my way to work. Can't go wrong with a simple bagel and cream cheese and I'm fond of their bagels (most bagels, really) so as long as I keep my breakfast order simple, we're cool."}
{"text":"I am probably the biggest fan of Panera. I have had lunch here many times and every time we are met with a smile and how can we help you.

If you come in to study, meet a friend, or just a quick bite to eat, this is certainly the place to be.

I do want to highly recommend the mac & cheese, this will certainly become your biggest addiction! It is AMAZING...and I am a brewed iced tea snob and the regular brewed iced tea is always great."}
{"text":"This place is a panera although they kept the Paradise Bakery name, which is misleading to customers. I actually miss the Paradise hospitality because that same feel really isn't felt at this panera location. I think the food is just average but also very expensive for the amount, so not worth the value. It's a good study spot but for such a nice area, I feel like there are many bugs and gnats. The gnats are an issue."}
{"text":"One star higher then mc Donald's... the service is great if you don't do it yourself. Just chicken and bacon seems to be precooked... now my cup of tea..it's fast food"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to work at as of recently. I've always loved Paradise's menu, but there's something about the way this particular location is laid out that makes it my favorite. Get a California Turkey and the Fire Roasted Tomato soup (or the black bean vegetarian), take your laptop, get on the free wifi and get the booth with the outlet.
Unless I'm there. I swear, if I see you in my booth, there WILL be trouble."}
{"text":"I love this place I like to sit back Very cozy the food is very good..
Let's not talk about they frozen lemonade OMG and the pastry are so good"}
{"text":"Just got home with food ordered through the drive thru.  I ordered a small soup for $4.59.  Opened the lid to find roughly a 1/2 of container of soup... probably about four oz if I measured it.  Horribly disappointed in the cost to size ratio."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the clean restaurant excellent food and service.  Thank you Lena Johnson and your crew for keeping the restaurant clean and great service.  My two girls enjoyed the pumpkin sugar cookies!! Will be back for another Sunday brunch"}
{"text":"This place is next to my office and is convenient for me in the morning  to go get some steel cut oatmeal with fruit and pecans, a power sandwich or a nice quiche with some coffee.  The soup and salad lunch deal is great, service is swift and the reputation of its bakery is well known.  This Panera has a nice ambiance.  Parking lot is sometimes hard to find a spot in during the midday.  I like the rewards card as I always seem to be getting a benefit.  The free w-fi is definitely a plus, and the table layout gives you some privacy even when the place is packed.  Not for those on a low carb diet, but for everyone else a nice restaurant for a quick meal."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in, be ready to be tempted with a showcase of baked goods! There's giant cinnamon buns, cookies of all sorts, chocolate fudge brownies, oh my! This is one of the few Panera breads that have new england clam chowder which is part of my same order of the pick two special. Come to find out, certain locations have them available only on Friays! the location is clean, plenty of parking, fast and efficient. As most PBs, there is free wifi, so this is a great spot if you wanted to eat and get some work done. One option they don't offer much anymore (unless you ask) if getting an apple with your meal instead of a banquette. So if you want fruit instead of carbs, don't be afraid to tell the cashier!"}
{"text":"We order Panera once a week for pick up because of our busy schedules and it's normally pretty good. The last 3 times we have come here, third being tonight our orders have been incomplete, wrong or missing most of the ingredients in the sandwiches or salads. Tonight we went back to get it fixed and still got a wrong sandwich we didn't even order! It's getting completely ridiculous at this point."}
{"text":"A great place to go to get out of the house, Panera offers free wi-fi and free refills on drinks and coffee!

Sandwiches, soups and salads are their specialties, as well as a large offering of baked goods. Cookies, bagels, muffins and whole loaves of bread are all made fresh in the store every day.

The \"pick two\" deal is two of either a half sandwich a bowl of soup or a salad, and they have an excellent selection of all. The soups rotate on a daily basis, so it's different every day.

I usually stop here to pick up breakfast on the way to work and the store is busy. Expect to wait a few minutes for your order to be taken as they are busy. The bagels are very good quality and very fresh. The \"everything\" bagel has plenty of sesame and poppy seeds plus garlic, onion and salt. I'd recommend that you ask them to toast it to give it the right flavor and go with the sun dried tomato cream cheese. They have a \"baker's dozen\" special with 13 bagels and two packets of cream cheese.

The coffee urn choices are light, bold, hazelnut or decaf and at this location, they put a note on it with the time the coffee was prepared. Skim milk and half and half are offered with the usual selection of white, pink blue and yellow packets of sweetener. Pepsi product as well as iced tea."}
{"text":"I find myself gravitating to Panera when I need a breakfast on the go and usually find the free wireless keeps me there for a little while. Great bread products, including bagels and pastries as well as whole loaves, Panera also makes delicious soups and salads. I particularly enjoy both the cinnamon loaf and the sourdough for making French toast at home.

The menu can certainly be confusing with one section near the breads that also has all the pastries. The other section has all the \"meal\" options with clearly labeled prices, but if you're not familiar with it, it is very easy to be overwhelmed. The staff are helpful with suggestions if you're not sure what you want and patient if you need to make a decision. Once ordered, the food is prepared and ready for pick up within minutes, even during the lunch rush.

On the negative side, it is a little on the spendy side for such casual eating. A cup of coffee, a bagel (\"premium\" bagels are another 25 cents) and a small tub of cream cheese is $4.09. The \"special\" pick two with a drink will run you close to $10, which is two of either a sandwich salad or soup. Don't get me wrong, it's delicious and very fresh, but for the setting, it seems a little bit on the high side of the price spectrum.

Like all of them, this Panera is very clean and the staff circulates regularly to clean up abandoned dishes on the tables (you're expected to bus your own) and refill the four coffee urns (bold, regular, decaf and hazelnut). The coffee and soda fountain has free refills and there have been a few days where I've just bought the one cup in the morning and then watched the breakfast crowd phase into lunch and then dinner, and never been hassled.

Panera is quite the hangout. I usually see people picking the location for casual meetings (does the phrase \"showing the plan\" mean anything to you?) and get togethers. Lots of people with laptops, there are electrical outlets near about half of the tables. The wi-fi is pretty stable (though I've occasionally had problems) and easy to connect. I see 7 or 8 other people with laptops and the connection is surprisingly fast."}
{"text":"I was looking for a whole wheat loaf, but at 11:30 AM they were pretty much sold out of most of the loaves on the shelves. Still, lots of pastries available and of course bagels and soups and salads and lunches. But no whole wheat loaves available today.

This place isn't easy to get to from Pineville-Matthews heading east. You have to make a U turn past Carmel or drive up Carmel and make a U turn at the post office. Crazy!"}
{"text":"Clean and roomy today as I sat for a half hour to get some wifi work done with a refillable cup of coffee. Wifi does work well but they will cut you off after a while to prevent people from sitting here all day to tie up a table. They have four urns of coffee flavors - decaf and hazlenut seem to be regular options - and the usual fixings.

Of course, Panera has tons of other stuff including sandwiches, soups, salads, bunches of pastries, fancy coffees, smoothies and suchlike. Lots of options."}
{"text":"Newly opened in the South Park Mall's food court, this Panera pretty much has the same menu and baked goods as the retail shop a little bit down the street. Sandwiches, soups, salads, even their great \"Pick Two\" menu option. Plus a full menu of breakfast sandwiches are available!

Because it's inside the South Park Mall, there is free wifi and plenty of seating available if you can stand the noise and clattering of all the other folks in here.

They have a couple of \"grab 'n' go\" parking spaces if you're just picking up a take-out order."}
{"text":"This seems to be the slowest service Panera ever. I have come here a few time with TOGO orders.. and waited far too long for a short Togo order (making me near late for work). Hire more workers or efficient workers. Other Locations have no problems"}
{"text":"Fabulous lunch! We were going to go to Wildflower like always but decided to check out the new Panaera. So glad we did. Everything was fresh and delicious. Definitely recommend for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I wanted something healthy and fresh to eat.  Panera Bread had many options for me to choose from.  It has been a very long time since I have visited Panera Bread and this location was the one I always visited.  I ordered the spinach power salad and the turkey chili and they both hit the spot.  The food tasted fresh and flavorful.  I never have bacon with my food (unless it is breakfast) but the bacon in the salad gave me a fresh look at salads that I prepare at home.  These are some of the healthier selections and I was glad to have them.  I will now renew my visits to Panera Bread since I know they have more locations throughout the area.  I could go with a lower price, but sometimes you just have to pay for what you want.  I also ran into a long-time friend in the restaurant; that was nice.  Oh, and the service was great!"}
{"text":"While the food was acceptable, service at the counter was sad. The clerk had no personality and, I'm sorry too say this, but her attitude sent me they message that not only didn't she want to be there but she didn't want to be bothered with us either! This restaurant is in a great location and needs to employ workers who can bring something to the table.

It was maybe 8pm and the bakery section was pretty empty. Folks, even in the late evening, customers may want some goodies!"}
{"text":"The Cheddar Broccoli Soup was fine, but nothing special for nearly $6.  The French Baguette that came with the soup was hard as a rock, small and cut my gums.  The Roasted Turkey & Avocado BLT Sandwich was way overpriced, also smaller than expected and didn't have much of the ingredients in it.  Hardly any avocado, tiny amount of roasted turkey, little to no mayo, wimpy lettuce piece, one micro-sized pre-made piece of bacon, decent amount of tomatoes and bread that definitely did not pass for actual sourdough.  Overall...pretty tasteless and inadequate for around $9.  The flavor was not very dynamic.  I make much better sandwiches at home and they don't run me $9.  The 1 oz. bag of their own brand Kettle-Cooked Potato Chips was not too bad, but for the large sandwich price, you would think it would include some sort of potato salad or pasta side.  And the Pecan Roll was pretty good to finish things off, although still overpriced at $3.  Almost $20 for one person to eat there and that didn't even include a drink.  Just not worth the trip for me or my daughter, who also was not impressed in the least.

On the flip side, the decor was pleasant and the employees there were very nice and friendly.  They were the best part of my experience.  But since I didn't come there mainly to interact with them, the food will not bring me back again and I would NOT recommend Panera Bread to anyone.  It definitely had the chance to be much better than it was...such a letdown."}
{"text":"Always great customer service here. Jonathan (Cashier) was very helpful and knowledgeable for what Panera had to offer. I would suggest signing up for their rewards program for discounts and free goodies."}
{"text":"This place is managed terribly. Understaffed and poorly run. Orders are half assed and you'll spend your entire lunch hour here just waiting for your order Don't do it to yourself."}
{"text":"I don't understand why they  don't deliver to
My home and it's less Than 5 miles from the store it's in a safe neighborhood. I call to place an order and the cashier gives me attitude talking about, \"sorry we just don't deliver to your address and none of the locations do. That is very strange because my old apartment was further than my house and they delivered. Panera Bread use to be professional and care about their customers feed back they are starting to go down hill."}
{"text":"I love Panera but the solon location is super disappointing. I ordered a steak and arugula sandwich to go and when I got home I took a bite and realized there was no meat in my sandwich. It's literally called a steak and arugula sandwich, come on now. The service is really weird and it took 20 minutes to get my sandwich and Mac and cheese even though there were like two customers in the store. The workers seem very unhappy and were acting very weird. Kind of makes me wonder if Panera drug tests. Very strange location and will avoid it from now on."}
{"text":"Panera is one of my favorite places to eat and I've ordered from this location more frequently than I care to admit.

Yes, the run out of things toward the end of the week. It sucks, yes but that's how it works. Saturday night there is usually more than one thing out of stock whether its bagels, desserts, soup or bread. 

Parking is a crazy mess here during peak hours. Parking lot is small and cramped. If you go in to the store I recommend going at off hours. Rapid pickup is \"supposed\" to have their own parking spaces to park in while you run in to grab your food but they are always being used either by other customers or delivery drivers. Seating inside during peak hours can be a challenge as well. I usually place my orders for delivery nowadays though I do enjoy the rapid pick up.

Staff inside are friendly although I don't get much interaction with them because I mostly order on the kiosks. The only time I see them is when they drop off the food at my table. Food is always delicious, healthy and nutritious. What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru. Ordered the pick 2 - had half chicken walnut sandwich and half spicy Thai chicken salad with extra dressing and extra peanut sauce. I get home and they gave me the wrong dressing. I think they gave me the Asian dressing, not the spicy lime Thai and no extra peanut sauce. Tried calling twice to let them know my order was wrong and no one picks up. This is frustrating"}
{"text":"Very efficient, friendly, and clean! I'm impressed with this location. Food was great, bread was fresh, and the pasty was delish!"}
{"text":"The stars continued to fall the longer I was there. I stopped by at about half after 7PM on a Wednesday to no line at the register and 6 employees behind the counter in the prep area; though no one to be found at the registers. More staff was throughout the store, but again, no one available to take a food order. After two minutes at the register (no problem), I was greeted by an employee about 20 feet away and asked to wait, which I patiently did, for another 5 minutes (odd, but still no problem). Eventually it was time to order. Once the order was completed (without error, I may add) it was back to the waiting game. I've been to busy Panera's - ones where you wait 15-20 minutes for food because they have 50+ customers at a time every 15 minutes. However, this is not one of those Paneras - be not mistaken. Regardless, with six people behind the counter in prep it took almost 10 minutes to prepare two pick-twos along with whatever other orders (mobile or otherwise) they were balancing (albeit poorly - now we have a problem). This is certainly not going to be on my list of paneras to visit from here on out, unless of course I'm prudent enough to order online half-an-hour out. Though at that point, I'd rather spend the half hour driving round trip to a more distant location. Thanks anyway, store 4082."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hoopla is about with Paradise, but I just can't seem to like it. I've tried several things on the menu: chicken walnut sandwich, breakfast quiche, oatmeal bowl, albacore tuna sandwich, and paradise roast beef sandwich. Even though the sandwiches tasted very fresh, they lacked flavor. I really like their oatmeal bowls, cookies and some pastries though. 

During my most recent visit (beginning of Nov.), the registers were not working so we got all of our food for free. As luck may have it, I found a strand of hair in my sandwich. GAGGGGGGGG. The busboy was nice enough to ask why I wasn't eating and offered a replacement. So kudos for trying to right a wrong situation, but too bad I had already lost my appetite."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places.  Everything so fresh. 
The service is top notch feeling like 5 star restaurant   
You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years.  It was better than I remembered!  The ordering kiosks offered a free cookie if you used them, but the meal arrived without any cookie and we didn't realize it until we saw the sign in the window when we left.  The salad ingredients were fresh and interesting, and the creamy wild rice soup is my favorite.  This is a solid choice for an impromptu meal near home."}
{"text":"Staying at a local hotel and ordered delivery from this location.  My order came super quick and completely accurate.  I tried the steak and cheddar panini for the first time and it was so good!  Loved the pickled onions and the beef had a nice touch of black pepper to it.  It's the 1st time I've ordered delivery from Panera and I was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite. The restaurant was spotless.  They had both an outside seating area and a screened in porch. The service was fast and friendly.  The food was fresh and flavorful.  The desserts were sinful.  Everything a Panera should be. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying that when Panera Bread took the Sierra Turkey off of the menu, it felt like the ultimate betrayal. I didn't think I'd recover, but as long as they kept the broccoli cheddar soup on the menu, we could still be friends - or so I thought. I've been to this specific Panera location about a half a dozen times, and it's always been a fairly seamless transaction. 

Order, buzzer, pick up meal, eat, tidy up, leave. 

The order of events this time was no different, only this particular occasion, there was something bothersome about our meal. My boyfriend and I had opted to split the 'You Pick 2' special and he'd ordered the half Turkey Apple Cheddar Sandwich. The bread was a soggy, hot mess. Completely saturated, falling apart and quite frankly, inedible. I told him to take it back to the pick up window and they'd make him a new one - confident in what I said, he took the plate and headed back to whence he came  - simple, right?

Upon explaining the situation, they guffawed and had the audacity to tell him that was how it was supposed to be. Are you kidding me? Who in their right mind thought that soggy bread would be appetizing? What chef thought, 'Hey! Here's an out of the box idea - soggy bread!' Nevertheless, my boyfriend insisted that that couldn't be right, and after some back and forth with additional attitude on their end, they finally agreed to take the sandwich back...where they swapped out the tops and gave him the same recycled fillings. 

I don't know about you, and maybe I'm being a diva, but when my sandwich has been repeatedly handled - I'm a bit put off, but more importantly - for a $20 meal, this kind of shoddy customer service is completely unacceptable. 

Don't want to rule off Panera Bread forever, but definitely this location."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday 10-25-15 around 4PM.  This Panera Bread is located in front of the Galleria Mall in Henderson.  

I've loved Panera Bread since high school and I come to this location probably once a month.  Having said that, this is undeniably the shittiest Panera Bread location I've ever seen.  It is just so filthy!!!  The sidewalk outside is littered with food, pigeon poo, and cigarette butts.  The windows and doors look like they have never been cleaned.  The furniture is all beat up and the floors are icky.  I have never been in the bathroom there because I'm afraid.  I always get my food to-go from this location. 

$16.40 got me a meal for me and my boy.  I got the \"you-pick-two\" with a Power Kale Chicken Caesar salad and an asiago steak sandwich, and I got the boy buttered noodles with a yogurt.  My favorite part of my meal was the warm piece of baguette that comes with it.  That thing is heaven with about 10 packets of their real  butter slathered on it.  

I got my food and went over to the drink area to grab twenty, er, I mean, a couple of butter packets and there was an employee there refilling the tea.  I know she saw me walk up, but she moved a giant container of tea right in front of the butter.  So I had to stand there and awkwardly wait for her to finish.  

Three stars because they got my order right, the food was delicious, and I didn't get sick.  Step up your game, Panera.  You gotta clean!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Panera bread when it comes to their salads and sandwiches.  The food is good but portion wise I never really feel like I'm getting good value for my money. I find that their best value for the money you spend is in the pick 2 deal. When trying to save money in the past I ordered a half salad and today I ordered just a half sandwich (both times packed to go) and each time I open my meal the portion size is disappointing. The salad that I ordered last time was so small I called to double check if they made it wrong - I was stunned.

Today I spent almost $10 on a half sandwich that was about the size of my (small) palm and a bag of chips that came with the sandwich. I won't be repeating this order.  If you don't care so much about paying for overpriced food then go for it - atleast it tastes good and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Mgmt needs to get it together in here. We just moved here and have been here 2x. Each time 4-5 employees in here but no clean tables, dishes stacked a mile high dirty by the trash, food all over the floors and the employees standing around shooting the bull. We won't be back until someone decides to clean this place up!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on 1/21/15. It was 8pm. No other customers. The young gal who helped us was very nice & patient since we hadn't had anything but a bagel in the past and we were asking a lot of questions.  The 3 young males that work there were chatting it up in a booth. One got up to make our sandwiches. I had the Mediterranean veggie & hubby had the turkey.  I just have to say I wasn't impressed . What's so hard about spreading the spread on the bread? Not a teaspoon blobbed in middle of bread& 2 THIN slices of cucumber on each half & I could of counted the feta speckles without taking my shoes off!  He didn't even bother to separate the tomato slices, they were still stacked or the onion! Male children need to be instructed better before serving the public. Both sandwiches came to $15 and change. Won't be back. That's a lot of money for what we received. Subway is a way better value. Veggie delight anyone?! :) that's all."}
{"text":"Ordered a panini, they made a regular sandwich.  Line too long and staff too hard to get attention to get them to correct the mistake."}
{"text":"This is a great Panera! They have their own private lot and it's very large. It's a great place to have a meeting with colleagues or just hanging out with friends/family. They even have a community room you can rent out for a party or meeting. 

I've only received good service here. The food has always been excellent and I love their baked goods! They always have hot cookies on the baking sheets and they're TO DIE FOR. 

I love the salads, sandwiches and soups! They're all amazing. Nothing but good stuff here."}
{"text":"Big Panera fan, not a fan of this location. I find they are always running out of items here. One time the self checkout kiosk even told us when paying that they ran out of something on our order while we were ringing it up - but funny enough it didn't tell us what that was!  Haha. We were stuck in an endless cycle of trying to remove and item and check out just to find that wasn't it. Kinda like whack-a-mole!

I also find that the tables are usually not clean at this location. Every other Panera I sometimes will come across a dirty table, but not every visit. 

Hopefully this location can step up. It's close to a lot of good shopping which makes it convenient to stop for a quick lunch or dinner. But I don't pick this location to visit unless I'm already over this way."}
{"text":"Why do you have \"10\" working in this place and it's not busy at high noon.  But why I rate them 2 cuz' it took 10 min, to make an Italian Combo."}
{"text":"This is the first Panera I have ever been to. It was not busy for dinner (they just opened on Wednesday), so ordering was fast.  Took about 6 minutes to get our food-not bad. I had the Turkey chili which was tasty. Food was fine-not fantastic. I will probably go back. I'd give it about 3.5 stars if I could. It is a great addition for the various offices in the neighborhood-one more choice of a place they can walk to."}
{"text":"Had such a disappointing experience here recently.  I used to love Panera years ago but hadn't been in a long time and had a gift card to use. 
  When we first walked in the cashier asked if we had any questions and I said 'Yes! I don't eat eggs or dairy or meat, what are my options?'  And the girl next to him immediately said all their bread has eggs in it.  Hm.  So no sandwiches or bread bowls.  But he said the black bean soup was vegan and I could get it  with chips.  Okay. So not super thrilled that that was my only option besides a salad considering they try to present themselves as a somewhat healthy option.  But whatever, I order it.  Another crew member comes over and reminds the cashier they were out of black bean today but did have a vegetable soup. I asked if it was vegan and he said yes. So I order that.
  It comes over to our table, with a piece of bread. I obviously hadn't wanted the bread considering the girl told me all their bread has eggs in it.  Also, there was a big dallop of pesto on top of my soup.  I asked the lady who brought it over if the pesto has cheese in it, she said no. I said are you sure because pesto traditionally has Parmesan and it looked like it.  So she went and got the manager who brought the recipe book.  Turns out- yes the pesto had cheese. They gladly took it back and brought me a fresh bowl without, which turned out to be pretty good.  Also- the French baguette served with my soup (mistakenly) did not have eggs in it according to recipe book.  Made me wonder if the cashiers had any clue about the ingredients.  It also shocked me that the general manager had to go in the recipe book to answer the question about the bread.  Do you even know what is in the food you are serving people?!  I work in the restaurant industry and the whole experience would have been a lot more pleasant had the workers been knowledgable about the menu.
  Too much trouble for what was to be a quick meal.  Not what they appear to be as far as healthy options.  But the lady who brought our food and the general manager did go out of their way to accommodate my dietary restrictions and that is very much appreciated.  Although I won't be returning I suppose people who don't care what they eat might have an alright experience here."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Panera Bread for their fresh salads, vegetables, bread.. Etc.. Well, here it is not like that at all. The salad I ordered was stale and tasted like it was a week old. My sisters sandwich was disgusting. She had the grilled cheese. And the pasta primavera tasted over a week old. None of the vegetables were fresh. The bread was hard as a rock!! The soup tasted horrible. Talk about being disappointed!! I will never come here again. Now I have to be convinced to ever eat at Panera Bread again!!! Definitely never recommend this place or its location!!"}
{"text":"I first discovered Panera on a trip to the US a couple of years back. I was very happy once I found out that Toronto was getting its own Panera, & downtown as well! I know alot of people dont enjoy it too much because of all the calories and pricing and whatnot, but i think that sometimes it's nice to come in here, sit down for a bit of breakfast, and just feel comfy. (I especially enjoy the Shrimp Roll that they have going on at the moment! Very delicious - a must try!)"}
{"text":"I'm from back east and we have lots of Panera Breads. I've never had a problem with this drive-thru, happy, friendly, and always right. Granted I order a bagel or the soufflé. I've been to the supposed highest grossing Panera in Tampa and it was a nightmare. I've also been to a few up and down the east coast that screwed up a black coffee, yes, that is a true statement! I did knock a star because this place is FAR from town and you never know if they'll have the soufflés, if they don't, they take 40 minutes to cook!"}
{"text":"My friend and I come every now and then (only on Fridays) for their Friday soup (claw chowder). You can do pick 2 for a sandwich and soup combo (what I do). 

Place your order, get a number, and find a table. You'll be brought your food.

Haven't had any issues with service nor food quality. They also have a claw chowder bread bowl (reminds me of Disneyland, hehe) so definitely try that out. 

Will be back on a Friday again soon :D."}
{"text":"I love Panera and this was one of the better restaurants. The staff even brings the food to you, which makes it a great place to set up shop and work for a while. Unfortunately, I didn't see any booths with outlets. I also didn't look very closely as I wanted to leave when my battery died on my computer. 

Also, cupcakery is in the same parking lot if you want sweets on the way out. Next time!"}
{"text":"It's ok but I miss Paradise and the free cookie with your sandwich! That was great. Got the piece of French bread as my side and it was not exciting. The sandwich itself was ok but the bread was nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"So my visit was short and sweet. They have great chairs to study and they have a wonderful system where they bring you food/drink to your table which I love! I didn't have to wait for the server to be ready with my food, I could right away, find a place to sit and wait for the food to come to me. 

I just had a quick catch up session with a friend and we had the best time! It has a very homey Starbucks feel and no one is rushing you! Starbucks is usually filled with a crazy amount of people and can be very loud. The ambiance was great for studying and chatting quietly with friends! 

This location is filled with students! So definitely a place to meet new people! 

My chai latte was suburb! It came in a nice ceramic cup which is nice since I was going for that feeling of being at home!"}
{"text":"Cold mac n chz, hair in food, undercooked pasta, overpriced food.  Gotta say this was an excellent teaching opportunity for the kids on how not to make & serve food.  Thanks, Panera.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Panera is my go to place. I lived in St Louis for many years and know what the quality of the original Panera (St Louis Bread Co) was. 

This location is AWFUL!! I  wish I read the reviews before I stopped by. It is not my normal location. I stopped because it was between where I was and where I was going AND it has a drive through. All I wanted was soup and a mocha latte. 10 minutes waiting in the drive through line to order (I was the 2nd car in line). Another 5 to get to the window. I pay and they hand me my latte. 4 minutes later my soup...SOUP took 4 minutes?!?! I look in the bag quickly then drive away. I get settled at my destination and pull out my soup. No spoon. You can always count on Panera to give you utensils...not this location. I then sip my latte. No mocha AT ALL. Never again!! Will happily drive out of my way."}
{"text":"Panera Is my fav spot for breakfast on sat & sundays. Great soups, specially the broccoli, potato and chicken noddle. 
Food is always top quality and service is fast and efficient."}
{"text":"If we're looking for a change from the usual burger fast food lunch, Panera is generally the place to go. We went here today to grab lunch while celebrating the miss' b-day. Don't worry I'm not cheaping on here...we're going to Eez Fusion later tonight. But I digress...back to Panera!

If you've never been, it's a more \"gourmet\" sandwich place than Subway or the other chains. That being said, the quality and the price are higher. We ended up paying $19 for lunch which got us two \"You Pick 2\" meals and one iced green tea to share. We went at around 12:45 and this place was PACKED for lunch! We had a bit of a wait on the line before we ordered, and the cashier was very friendly. She actually walked over and got me the iced green tea...in many Paneras that is someone elses job, but that other person never seems to be around, so I wait five minutes or more for a drink. Anywho, the place was so packed that we had to hover around for a minute or so after picking up our meals before a table left, and we shot over to snag it.

If you go, the broccoli cheese soup is a must. I don't know what they do to it, but it is simply divine, and something I get everytime I go to a Panera. I also went with the roast beef sandwich which was pretty tasty. The miss' had the broccoli soup with the turkey/artichoke sandwich and she enjoyed it. 

I recommend Panera if you're in the mood for a higher quality lunch than you would get at a burger joint. It's a bit busy and cramped, and the prices are a bit higher than you might want to pay for lunch, but the price reflects the quality of the meal."}
{"text":"Can we please get rid of the 3oz water cups? It can't possibly cost that much more to have a normal sized cup available for water. Not everyone wants a cup of high fructose corn syrup with their lunch."}
{"text":"We walked in around 10:45a to grab something for breakfast, apparently breakfast was finished for the day. So we settled for an Asiago bagel as nibbles. The bagel was good, lightly toasted on the outside and soft on the inside. But then I looked at the receipt, they charged $1.34 for the bagel.. Reasonable but $1.25 for a small little cup of mediocre cream cheese.. Not cool. Shouldn't be more than 50 cents. 

Stick to sandwiches and larger items here. I won't be purchasing bagels again. There is ample seating with a good amount of outlets. I would go for the free Wifi and some coffee but the temperature is way too cold in there and I can't stand the loiterers who have 5 hour yelling phone conversations without regard for paying customers. Hopefully I'll catch this Panera bread on a good day next time."}
{"text":"This is solely based on the chai I ordered....

It was gross.  I don't really know what else to say.  I'm always hesitant to order a chai at chains because they usually use a powder based chai mix instead of the chai concentrate most independent coffee houses (and Starbucks=Tazo brand) use.  

I have to preface this by saying I hardly EVER throw food or drink away if I'm not into it.  I usually suck it up with a good effort.  I took the first sip and realized this wasn't going to end well.  It was so sugary sweet that it overpowered every taste bud in my mouth.  I tasted no spicy kick a chai usually has.  Sometimes if my chai is too sweet I'll add more ice cubes or milk but there was no helping this little guy out.  It was a waste.

I threw it out after a couple sips.  $4 down the drain, literally.  

So stick to a water or pop while visiting a Panera, It's safer."}
{"text":"The only thing panera is good for is their kind of appealing aesthetics. Nothing more. I HATE their food, it tastes like a fucking MRI. Not a single time did I have a good experience at Panera in any of the locations I've been to. Their goddamn bakery items aren't even good. If you can't specialize in anything, consider communism."}
{"text":"Service messed up my order twice, food was alright."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location and it did not disappoint. I loved the convenience of being able to order in an interactive screen just as you walk in. (No need to go to the counter unless you want to.) After you order and pay you just find a table and wait for your food to come to you. So fast and easy. The food is amazing and fresh as normal. I love their broccoli cheddar soup. This was my first time trying the kids meals (never realized they had kids meal), they were great and my girls loved getting options. One opted for the ham and cheese with yogurt and the other got the grilled cheese and yogurt. My favorite is always the pick 2 option. I love being able to get a cup of soup and half a sandwich, it is the perfect size for me. The personnel working here were really friendly and accommodating. We could not find the small water cup lids for the kids cups and an associate went and got us some from the back. I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"I am a Panera fan.  Went back again today, and ordered the same thing.  YAY I got chicken and Avocado this time!!!  Boooo, they did not chop it, and forgot the egg.  I have faith in you, Panera....will try again next week...don't let me down!"}
{"text":"Very overrated, nothing special about the food, snacks or coffee. They seem to always make a mistake on my order. In my opinion, it's an overpriced Tim Hortons."}
{"text":"I KNOW for a FACT that my smoothie is supposed to come with one of those fun-colored fat straws, but they gave me a boring-ass clear one?!?! I'm concerned and frustrated. What's the deal Panera?!"}
{"text":"Nice place but clearly the youngest manager is pulling all the weight and it's very sad. I see her running around trying to fix any issues more than any other managers."}
{"text":"Just moved out to here to Phoenix. But while I was at my home stay in Florida I was a Panera addict I would go all the time I love their customer service and I love their food. 
    But ever since I've gotten here the Panera's here are very stingy with bread. Usually when I go to Panera and ask for an extra piece of bread its nothing here they want to charge me?! 
     Its like they never got the memo of what Panera is supposed to be like. They don't call out hot bread and give out fresh bread. Which is one of my favorite things about Panera. Also stingy with the dressings too. Panera supposed to be about customer service and giving the customer what they want not about charging them from every like extra thing that they want on their food. 
      We hope that soon they changed their management or something because they obviously don't know what Panera is supposed to be. 

Update: I came in today to go get a Caesar salad. At the time they hadn't made any bread so there were no more baguettes. I asked to switch out for the bread bowl. And the guy wanted to refuse me because it cost them $2 to give me one bread bowl.  how cheap!"}
{"text":"Triple check your order if you use rapid pickup.  They let me walk out tonight missing FOUR items.  Once I realized I was missing most of my order, I came back.  Turned out, they knew they had shorted me, they were out of the items, but didn't bother to mention it.  I accepted the refund for the missing items but when I got to my destination (essentially the middle of nowhere), there was more.  There was no dressing for my salad, no avacado in my salad, no baguette (the side I ordered) and no silverware.  I had to eat with my fingers. This place is falling apart. Order from a different Panera if you actually want to eat food."}
{"text":"Serving sizes wouldnt fill my 7 year old!  Way overpriced!  2 out of 3 times got my order wrong!  Im done with this place."}
{"text":"I visit this Panera regularly, this time I felt I had to submit a review.  It is way too often that I place a rapid pick up order through their app to have part of it \"out of stock\" or unavailable when I arrive.  Now it is about 15 minutes to get here from home but wasting gas and time is ridiculous!  This place needs to better track there products and notify customers ahead of time before driving to pick it up.  This last trip was for a four cheese soufflé, very good when you can get one although small in size.  I get there and the ticket says \"see window\", oh here we go...... turns out they had some in the oven, but someone took them out and left them to get cold.  Refund please, again.  Just a word of advice, if you place an order for pick up, maybe call ahead as well to verify they have all you ordered \"in stock\"."}
{"text":"I have recently went back to this Panera location and what a difference!! My food is brought to me, they brought me cheese, and they took my plates when I was done. I think it is a way better Panera than it was 3 months ago. I NOW come here all the time and my order is always right! Yay"}
{"text":"Panera Bread is usually a pretty good bet when you are traveling and are unfamiliar with the local places, as my son and I were this past weekend.  My pet peeve with Panera is that the food order comes out in a hap-hazard way.  But not at this location!  I was so delighted to be handed a gadget to place on my table and was told that the order would come to me!  Hallelujah!  And it did - the complete order all in one go, and in a speedy fashion.  So refreshing to get this sort of service.  I was there with my son for a quick bite on Saturday lunchtime so the smooth and efficient service surpassed my expectations.  PS  The turkey chili was amazing.....I had never had that off the menu before, and I highly recommend it.  Came away very happy.  Great Panera location."}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting this spot. Definitely not for me! Service is crap and food is bland. No thanks!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was obviously new, which wasn't a problem. The lack of assistance she received from the coworkers standing around was discouraging. Our food was delicious, aside from my usual turkey and cranberry flat bread. It was missing the cranberries. I went and asked for some on the side, one of the 3 girls behind the counter got them for me. I had my hand extended to accept the little container, and instead of handing it to me, she tossed it at me with an attitude that seemed like I was inconveniencing her! Usually the staff at the various Paneras I go to are friendly and helpful, unfortunately for me this wasn't my experience today. The young man cleaning tables and floors seemed busy but did get us a high chair as soon as we found a seat. He was very polite.

The changing table's straps are broken too. I would hope that they value the safety of their customers enough to have that fixed ASAP."}
{"text":"So disappointed, again. First time I came here I waited way too long for food to arrive due to a computer glitch. So fine, I understand things happen. Food was good especially the broccoli cheddar soup. So I decided to try it again. This time I wait even longer for my food to arrive due into the fact that cashier gave me the wrong pager. They couldn't find me in their half of empty restaurant til about 20 minutes later . When the cashier finds me she tells me what happened and apologizes. Then the \"server\" brings my sandwich and soup. Cold sandwich and lukewarm broccoli cheddar soup I should say. I guess they didn't want me to wait any longer so decided for me to not get a hot fresh meal.
Not willing to be disappointed here again. Never will come back!"}
{"text":"My go-to is always a Chicken Walnut Sandwich on Wheat and it comes with tomato and lettuce. I also order the Broccoli Cheddar Soup which is always perfect for the cold weather and is deliciously creamy. I also had the Blood Orange Lemonade which I didn't find to be too sweet. 

I tried the Rapid Pick-Up (ordering online) and the navigation process of ordering was slightly difficult. It took a couple minutes to find the checkout button as it blended in with the color scheme of the site. Despite that, the food was ready to be picked up within a minute of its expected time."}
{"text":"I'm not one to write awful reviews. I work in customer service myself, and I love it. I also know that when potential customers are around and you're at your place of business you're to act appropriate and represent said business. 
I'm staying at the Spring Hill Suites on business and it's my first time in Pittsburgh. 
I stopped at the Panera under the hotel for a drink this morning and the service and employees were lovely. 
I came back for dinner later that night (10/27) when I got off work. The food was okay. My flatbread was burnt and sloppily thrown together. That's whatever. It still tasted good. Later, around quarter after nine I came down to sit outside and relax. Employees brought out a ton of food and bread and I'm assuming it was being donated or something? I don't know. 
As I sat there the two young me (employees im assuming, they weren't in uniform) came back to the door it was locked because they're closed. 
They started POUNDING on the door screaming and cursing and acting like just animals. Loud enough to catch the cop (who was on the other side of the area) walk down to see what the heck was going. The girl employees were laughing not letting them in. So they continued to act like animals banging and screaming on the door. I'm sorry, but it was completely unacceptable. I wasn't 10 feet away from them and they're acting like this. 
It was just odd and unacceptable. The cop walked over and they were let in and asked me if they're supposed to be in there. I honestly said that I had no idea. 
It was just loud, annoying and ridiculous. Sorry."}
{"text":"Good service. This is a place to go if you want to read a book, catch up with some friends, or do work on your laptop. The food is good, however they are small portions especially for the higher prices. If you can see past that, this is a place to get work done."}
{"text":"This location has gotten a lot better than when they first opened. I'm glad to have them in the neighbor!"}
{"text":"Horrendous service.  Multiple staff doing nothing while line waits and it is obvious they could care less."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here for Mother's Day. Got the fact that it is a holiday weekend, but come on, 30 mins to wait for your meal at a bakery?? We left. And saw many others leave as well. Lots of $$s to lose. I have been to Panera's across the country. They are very good. This facility is letting down the entire company."}
{"text":"I love Paradise! The salads and sammies are delicious and you get a delicious cookie with your order. The line gets long during the lunch rush but they clear it relatively quickly."}
{"text":"Wow, I highly suggest not going at lunch time and if you do be prepared. Parking was a pain not to mention everyone was driving wayyy too fast. Before entering I already saw a huge line but I went in anyways! 

I saw on their menu that they have a 2 for 6.99 deal going on. So I got the broccoli cheddar, Caesar salad, and baguette. As for a drink I just got a cup of water since its free and it doesn't taste like sink water lol.

Wondering why I only gave three stars? Not because of the line and not because of the parking lot. I knocked off two stars all because of their CRAPPY Caesar Salad! The lettuce was BROWN! & the good colored lettuce is that part that taste like water. Not to mention was barely any dressing so I was basically chewing water =\ oh oh and I cannot forget the croutons..wow that thing was STALE.  

The soup on the other hand was SO GOOD. I wish I had gone with my initial thought which was to get a bread bowl. The cherry on top was the baguette though! I just love dipping bread into soup and eating it! 

Overall I'll be back for soup and skip on their salad.."}
{"text":"I so miss Paradise Bakery. No more southwest chicken caesar salad. Rplaced by something their website shows as full of carbs. Traffic flow in the stores chaotic with the kiosks in the way -when they actually work. Too bad. Really like Paradise."}
{"text":"This was the oddest location for a Paradise Bakery I've seen. I would have missed it entirely if I had blinked. Usually it's attached to a mall or a larger shopping area, but this one is in a semi-run down strip mall. The parking lot was very narrow, and the mini-van felt huge trying to squeeze into a space. Inside is exactly the same of course, and I ordered a cafe mocha. The gal working was very nice and chatty, I always appreciate it when employees make an effort to have a conversation with you. It's more personal, and that is why I would want to go back."}
{"text":"I just love their breads, desserts, soups, sandwich's and salads. I've loved them all the way back to San Diego... I know I can always get a great salad/soup combo whether I'm on the east coast or west. 

I like this location as the staff is friendly, tables are clean, next to shopping convenience, and free wifi. 

I find it harder for me to concentrate here, but if' it's too busy or loud around lunch I will head across the street to Caribu to do some work. 

Again love their breads... too bad I've cut out carbs... so it's a special treat to have a couple bits of a baguette."}
{"text":"I got two sandwiches here.  One was just a kind of basic turkey sandwich and the other was a Chicken and Kale panini.  Both were super basic and not very flavorful, but they served their purpose.  The baked chips that come with them are bleh!  I know they're healthier than regular chips, but it's not worth it.  Who wants to live for long in a world with bad-tasting food??

I do appreciate that they open so early (6 am) on the weekend!"}
{"text":"One of the girls  behind the register with the hooped earrings was fairly rude, everyone else was pleasant.  Food was great as usual.  Get your employees under control or lose business."}
{"text":"I don't love this place anymore! $23 dollars was not worth what me and my mom had ordered! The sandwiches were nasty, the soup portion was cut in half (the one my mom ate)! Smaller portions aren't good! Change back to original! You guys are losing business because of your portions! Lower your prices on the U Pick 2 please!! It was $8.99! Bring that price back! I am never eating here again! I only came today bedside my reward for daily bagel was going to expire! The bagel wasn't even free! My mom told me that! Ugh!!! Stupid place! At chipotle you can get 2 for $20 and you get more food at that price and at Zupas you get more for less there too! 
Be original please! !!!!  Was very irritated today!!! Especially being Halloween!!! I hated the salad too!! It was not good!!! NEVER coming ever again!!!"}
{"text":"Love Panera but upset by the accuracy of my order. Did not receive one item and another was wrong. Didn't realize it, took my order to go and got home with completely wrong order. Tried to call (three times) with no answer. I will think twice before going back to this location, really frustrating."}
{"text":"I just had the best customer service!! I ordered a you-pick-two with soup & a salad. While waiting for the order I noticed that I had been charged for two salads. I went back & told the cashier & she told the kitchen. I asked her if there would be a different charge but she said don't worry about it (I think I was supposed to be charged less & she misunderstood). When the server came out with my food she had not been told about the mix-up but she didn't think I had wanted 2 salads. She offered to adjust the charge & bring me out what I ordered. When she came back with my food she said due to the mix up my meal was on them! What a nice surprise!  That is great customer service!!"}
{"text":"Just happen to swing by on this Panera since it was close to UNLV. Twas absolutely the worst service ever. First i waited on line then it took about 17 mins to get my bagels. And those are UNtoasted!!! WTH!!! Employees need to focus on customers first rather than chatting in the back!"}
{"text":"Restaurant review
There has always been a place for great sandwiches and salads this location is no different. Although it continues to be very pricey they do prepare fresh meals. The parking is a bit cramped at times and service can be hit or miss. What I mean by this is that the employees are not always the friendliest unlike other Panera's I've been to.

Pros: Fresh sandwiches and salads with quality ingredients

Cons: I feel the prices of Panera continues to climb

Hidden deals:

{"text":"The sign still says Paradise Bakery. I ordered pick 2 off the menu (ancient grain/arugula salad and turkey BLT). Food came out super fast and they were very helpful. However, food was mediocre at best. They lost something when Panera took over Paradise. The only thing I really enjoyed here was the cookies."}
{"text":"Okay, so when I first walked in, it smelled like old moldy water. I couldn't even sit inside because of the smell. I got two of the green goddess cobb salads with chicken. It takes forever to get to my outside table and then there is no chicken on either salad! I got the pick two with my salad and then I got a steak and white cheddar panini with horseradish on the side, and it was no where to be found. I told them about the chicken, so they brought out a bowl of cold, almost frozen chicken to my table. I was so disappointed with the service and cleanliness of the store. The bathroom was also very disgusting. I know Panera has nothing to do with rude families and their children, but there was a lady outside with her 3 children who were screaming and crying anytime someone talked, opened the door or put their silverware/dish ware in the designated area. They were complaining there were too many people out side, I was there with one other person and then there was one other guy....? The lady said nothing to her children, and they came up to my table, touched my jacket and purse and started screaming crying. They then blocked the door and said that no one could leave and the mother said nothing.. I was just so displeased with the service by the workers and the customers there. I will not return."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! It's huge inside, has outdoor seating, and several registers open during their lunch rush. 
The food is always consistent. The staff is always super friendly. And I always leave happy. No complaints here."}
{"text":"Waited 42 mins for the smallest bowl of soup and a sandwich that looked like it had been thrown together.  3 times a server came over with the wrong food.  Do not recommend eating here, bagels are fine.  Restaurant also looks like it hadn't been cleaned."}
{"text":"Good for half soup, sandwich or salad deal. iced green tea drink is my favorite.
French onion and turkey is yummy, and if your order a snack for 99 cent."}
{"text":"Went here with my sister about a month ago. I got a pick 2, and chose the chicken noodle soup and the steak and arugula sandwich. We go home, I take a nap, and I wake up with THE WORST stomach pain. Turns out I got food poisoning. I'm running to and from the bathroom, struggling to keep it together from both ends. It lasted for three days, with a clouded head and lack of appetite on the fourth day. 

I reached out to Panera on Twitter to make sure I got in contact with some type of corporate member, and they were very courteous. They said they had reached out to the franchise owners for that Panera, and that they would be in contact with me within the next 48 hours. The franchise never contacted me, so I contacted Panera again on Twitter, and they said they reached out to them again, saying it should be another 24 hours before I hear from them. I didn't receive a call from anyone, so I just gave up and advised everyone I knew to stay away from that Panera and their steak and arugula sandwich."}
{"text":"My favorite place to go to when I can't think of anything else to eat. 

Lots of variety and you won't feel 100% unhealthy after downing it. Good change up from fast food."}
{"text":"Terrible service, terrible attitudes, and overall not welcoming. I would NOT recommend this Panera and Our team loves Panera. We ordered for our team and they couldn't have been more rude. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I visited this location on 3/8/2013. The experience was ok. It was my first time at Panera and the only reason I decided to go was because my pregnant wife wanted something simple. (I personally prefer Jason's Deli which just happens to be around the corner). We went and ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich and the roasted turkey artichoke sandwich along with a cheese and broccoli soup. The soup was great and the chipotle chicken sandwich was decent. However my wife did not have such a great experience as she had to literally order her sandwich 3 times before they somewhat got it right. There was also no customer service as she had to keep going to the cooking line herself to get the correct sandwich and take the wrong one back plenty of workers saw her going back and forth. It's not hard to miss a pregnant lady and not one worker offered to try and rectify the issue. I will not be returning to this establishment.."}
{"text":"No surprises. Was clean and friendly. Nice place to gather with friends or have a bite alone. Was happy to see they had help-yourself to cold coffee at the coffee bar. Add a little sweetener and cream for a delicious cup."}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday at 12:30 with three others.  Ordered right away.  You get a number and the food is served to you.  All foods were good--soup and half sandwich, and salad.  Coffee was good and hot.  Lived up to other Paneras I've been to."}
{"text":"The food here is good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here or tell someone they are missing out if they haven't tried it.  I'd probably give it an extra star if the prices were lower.  A sandwich (with your choice of chips, apple, or piece of bread) is going to run you around $7.00.  And the sandwiches seem small for the price.  I can't leave this place full without spending at least $14.00."}
{"text":"Before I go to the La Boulange I used to think that Panera bread carries decent menu but after I've tried better healthy organic menu for the cheaper price I don't think so anymore.
The large portion of the bread with lots of sugarly thing I am sure that this place contributes American's obesity issue like any other place.
Certainly I prefer the La Boulange's small portion with quality menu and healthier drinks.
I won't go back to place never again."}
{"text":"like this place but the female server for breakfast has a little attitude and and doesnt seem to notice when the begals are black burnt lol but the male was nice it was my first time there and they need more employees for the morning shift other than that food was tasty"}
{"text":"Let me be clear - the service was PHENOMENAL! The gentleman helped me to my car and got my catering order together in a jiffy. BUT the food quality - a 1 star- for a $240 order of breakfast sandwiches I was surely disappointed. The bread, HARD, the sandwich on the inside, soggy even the paper they were wrapped in was soaked through with oil and a mess to get out. For a business breakfast a total disappointment. Even the \"fruit platter\" was just some cubed melon in a plastic bowl. I could've gotten a better assortment at the grocery store for 1/6 of the price."}
{"text":"My visit this morning to Panera Bread, I stopped in to buy a gift card for a friend's birthday.  While waiting in line decided to order the egg white/avocado/cheese/tomato whole wheat bagel sandwich ...

1.  The counter girl didn't ask for my Panera number.
2.  From the time I placed my order (to go) and they called my name, almost 10 mins!
3.  10 mins wouldn't be so bad, but a lady that arrived significantly after me was called right before me.
4.  The sandwich looked nothing like the poster.
5.  The sandwich was cold."}
{"text":"Place not clean, food was like warm and not very tasty. Management seems not interested in the overall appearance or quality of the business."}
{"text":"I have a 25% love and 75% hate relationship with Panera. They make you feel like you're eating healthy when you're really not. They're hella expensive for no freaking reason. I always get the \"You Pick 2\" and there's no way that half a salad and microwaved soup is $10. No way. I always avoid coming here for that reason but there's tons of tables, is in a convenient location, free WiFi and the environment can be nice. The service is always quick and they always get my order right. 

The 25% love is for their bakery goods. Their brownies are out of this freaking world and I know that they are baked fresh every morning. None of their other food are, even if they claim to be. Baked fresh every morning. 

I only come here when I feel like using my points from the Pocket Points app because then you can get BOGO You Pick 2; which makes it a little more affordable because then I have enough food to feed me for two meals. Otherwise, no way would I waste my money here."}
{"text":"Went to this Panera and ordered a toasted bagel and a coffee.  I filled my coffee while the bagel was toasting and there was no Splenda.  They brought me the bagel and it was sliced unevenly, I mean very unevenly (one half was about 10% of the width.  I asked for another one and it wasn't toasted.  I asked them to toast it and they burnt it.  I asked for the manager.  Her name was Stacey and she was busy preparing food.  I told her what happened and without saying anything she brought me another properly toasted bagel.  Then I told her about the Splenda.  Her response was \"technically we do have the blue stuff and the pink stuff but we're out of Splenda\".  I told her that would have been useful information when I ordered the coffee and I only use Splenda.  She eyeballed me and started preparing food again.  I stood there and she said \"is there anything you want?\".  A refund on the coffee would have been a nice gesture.  I left and called Panera customer service and told them the story.  The lady I spoke to said that was unacceptable and I would hear from someone soon.  That was 2 weeks ago and I haven't heard squat.  Not surprised by the negative comments about this Panera.  Never going back."}
{"text":"I always go to this panera, and it's usually fine when I eat there. Carry out is a different story.... the employees work ethic is not very good, and seem to take their time with everything. If you ever want to get a to go, then do rapid pick up because I'm sick of always waiting long for such a small order."}
{"text":"This is the worst panera ever. Do not go there! They were understaffed and the manager was not very friendly. Also my Caesar salad was only half full, and when I opened my dressing that was probably 1/3 full. Then as I was eating my salad I found a blueberry which I picked out, and then I picked out a dried apple crisp (in my Caesar salad). I have been to this panera multiple times because of the convenience of the location, and they have always been slow. After this experience, I will never go back."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich was yummy. Coffee tastes, literally, like water... I tried both coffee's they had out front and then ended up asking them to use the coffee from the back and they all tasted exactly the same, like water. Total party foul esp when you have a 6am flight. I dumped the coffee and went next door to Cartel. Can't be that hard to brew a decent cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Can be hard to find parking during peek hours but well worth the wait. Food is excellent and service staff is friendly as always."}
{"text":"Had a breakfast sandwich with a green egg. Not just a spot. The eggs are handled 3x before I get it, this should've been caught. I chat with Panera, they alerted management, management never reached out. When I stopped in they told me that corporate never told them. I'm leery about anything there now."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here yet so decided to check it out. I tried the pick 2 which is half sandwich, soup or salad and a side of chips, pastry or piece of baguette. I decided to do the chicken salad sandwich, which was pretty plain (fine by me ) but super salty. It came on a molasses bread but i spread it on the baguette instead. I also did the chinese chicken salad. Not bad, but just not my thing. I dont know if its the dressing or too many ingredients. Definitely not enough chicken. There was maybe 4 tiny slices. I did a side of mac n cheese as well. It was creamy and hearty, I really liked it. The baguette was very tasty, chewy and perfect side for my salad. I also grabbed a small bag of their homemade little chipper cookies. Oatmeal, chocolate with white chips and there was supposed to be chocolate chip but I think they accidentally put 1 more of the other 2 in there. They were fresh and pretty great. I'll definitely come back to try the soup, it all looked really amazing."}
{"text":"My wife had coffee here this morning and got violently ill. They do not clean out the containers for coffee and use harsh detergents with residue. Stay away from this place if you value your health. Words of warning."}
{"text":"Me and couple of gals from work went to try this location. Ordered the broccoli cheddar soup with steak and arugula sandwich.  The soup and the sandwich tasted pretty good as well as the service but is really bugged me how the place was dirty and no attention was given to clean up after some customers and it was just a mess. We couldn't find a clean table to sit so we had to clean our own table . Did not enjoy eating in dirt like that"}
{"text":"Great food fast with breakfast sandwiches...salads are refreshing love arugala, but 4 stars for forgotten chicken on my last salad. Regardless good for you food needs praise and I prefer their coffee to everywhere Else."}
{"text":"Take the extra 5 minutes to drive to the Monroeville Panera.  This location has management and personnel issues that make the customer experience one of the worst."}
{"text":"I don't understand what all the negative reviews are for. My food was great and the service great was as well"}
{"text":"The panera...panera....It is getting worst...after changed the ownership of company.. The service is great..but always thinking that the cashier are not nice all the time..doesn't need to smile but at least no grumpy face., and voice.  I always think \"why\" Did I something wrong to come and buying the food....hum...."}
{"text":"They don't answer the phone. They don't post their hours. When you finally enter the restaurant, the employees are miserable and one can tell they don't want to be there. I don't post on this stupid app very often. I am actually against most of the negative posts on Yelp that make mine and my friends' businesses look bad. But damn. I had to post about this horrible franchise for this chain. Obviously they don't care because this is nothing new of a post. Hopefully this Panera goes out of business soon."}
{"text":"Maybe the reason they have installed kiosks to take the orders is because the actual person to person service is terrible. I went in the get loaf bread sliced. The girl behind the counter just pointed to the breads. I asked her if there was any french and she asked her manager who was standing there but didn't even bother to look up from her paper work. I chose the Focaccia and asked if it could be sliced they said yes and then bagged it up and charged me. Never said thank you, have a nice day or come back soon. This was the first time since I have been in Arizona  weeks where I have run into rude sales people. Stick with the Kiosks if your people can't be nicer."}
{"text":"Wow went there to work ! I smell like sewage!!!!! Would never think to eat there ! At first I thought they had rotten eggs but it's the sewage issue ! Would not cater or eat here yuck !"}
{"text":"I ordered the bowl of chicken noodle soup and was so disappointed by not only the portion but also the taste that I drove 10 minutes to Safeway to buy chicken noodle soups twice the size and half the price. Pictured left, panera soup bowl $5.79 and Safeway soup bowl $2.75 right. Save your money and your time, don't go to Panera."}
{"text":"As some one who tries to eat healthy I seldom eat out.  Last week I had the flu and my husband, against his better judgment stopped there to get me a soup and sandwich. When he got home my flatbread was not in the bag, but was on the receipt, and had been paid for. My husband had a long day that was not yet over and was unable to return to get my food.  I called and spoke to the manager (one I had spoken to on several occasions with unsatisfactory outcome and much rudeness).  This started out okay with her apologizing for messing up the order and asking how she could correct the problem.  I told her the only way my problem could be corrected was if my food could be delivered as I was sick. She replied that she was unable to leave as \"the store is full of minors\". I told her I didn't understand and she said all of her employees were minors and she could not leave them alone!  She then offered to send me coupons to repay for the flat bread which I have received.   There are other Paneras where I could use them.  Done and done."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place is always one of the top choices for vegan options, as the only plant-based foods are protein-less salads or the smoothies. (Unless I'm coming on all the wrong days...) I always leave Panera Bread hungry and broke! 
The food is expensive and (from what my omni friends seem to be eating) nothing special; I suppose we are really paying for is the upper middle class vibe."}
{"text":"The only time I got something here was for some coffee, which was good but nothing really to write about. But then a friend of mine bought me a breakfast sandwich from here and it was...oh my delicious.

It was so good I went back the next morning and got another one, of course i bought one for my friend since we work together."}
{"text":"I always hear about how wonderful Panera is, unfortunately I can't share that sentiment. Didnt try anything crazy, but did go for the bread bowl, not bad but not great. The soup was so so, unfortunately it was lukewarm which isn't how I enjoy my soup. 
I will comment on the atmosphere and say that it was pleasant. If you're into studying, looking for a place to read, etc go here. It's quite nice."}
{"text":"Lots of seating.  Order at the counter and they give you a buzzer which rings when your food is ready.  Love the pick two options.   Oh and if you are  staying at the Springhill Suites they will deliver to your room which is a bonus!!"}
{"text":"This Panera branch has clearly mastered customer service. Every time I come here, the cashiers are super nice and friendly, and I always leave smiling. 

The food is always good.

The takeout is very fast. 

When dining in, everything seems very clean.

Overall, solid Panera location that I'll keep on coming back to."}
{"text":"It is the same as the other locations I have tried. Very consistent and hits the spot when I am in a hurry for lunch. It would be nice if they had some breakfast options available other than just bagels. I will continue to eat here as I always know that i am going to get an above average meal."}
{"text":"I walked into this restaurant and got the Thai chicken salad, broccoli cheddar soup and cappuccino. Loved the items and not sure why the lousy reviews. The staff was nice and friendly. Cappuccino was not too bitter and could enjoy it without sugar. I would come here again."}
{"text":"This place is a joke if you ever order your food to go. They give you half the food you would get if your were to dine in. I paid 5 bucks for half a cup of soup! Ridiculous! I went to a local market in the neighborhood and they gave me twice as much for the same price. They are literally stealing your money from you. This just goes to show you that chain restaurants only care about the money, not the dining experience. Again literally taking money from everyone. I would suggest they give the customers their fair share of food for the right price. I would like a BIG cup of soup not a half ass cup of soup. I'm not a baby I'm an adult feed me like I am. Thanks..or no thanks.. won't be ordering from here unless their portion sizes become magically bigger."}
{"text":"I'm very excited the new location is near my house.  Everything here is fresh and well made.  I have never experienced bad service or food quality. Even when it's busy the food is fast and correct"}
{"text":"I'm from Texas so I was able to eat Panera Bread on a regular basis. I'm happy that there's finally a location in Phoenix, especially so close to where I love. Food is good (my favorite sandwich is the Mediterranean veggie). Pastas are good and I love getting a chocolate chip cookie.

Service here is a bit slow. Hopefully things will pick up once the store is a little less new."}
{"text":"Ordered broccoli bread bowl even though it was delish for $6 i expected more  soup, its litterly 8oz of soup ,not ok"}
{"text":"Ate here last night and it took 17 minutes for them to produce a pick 2 (for which the \"half sandwich\" now looks to be about the size of a quarter sandwich and another sandwich.  There were three people making sandwiches behind the counter.  At 15 minutes I spoke to what looked to be the leader and said \"it's been 15 minutes since we ordered.\"  She responded, \"are you Matt?, we're waiting on your Bacon Turkey Bravo.\"  No apologies, no explanations.  The silverware was and is always dirty at this location and I always request plastic."}
{"text":"I absolutely despise the fact that Panera has replaced my beloved Paradise Bakery. The menu is so much worse. The food is so much worse. Everything about this place is SO MUCH WORSE.

Paradise had a great grilled cheese sandwich. Good quality, healthy bread and multiple cheeses. Panera has an aggressively disgusting version with a huge glop of American cheese (barely melted all the way) between two pieces of limp, non-crispy/soggy WHITE bread. It is horrendous and offensive on every level imaginable. My two year old nephew could slap together a more appetizing sandwich!

Today I tried the tomato mozzarella flatbread and it was pretty much ALL tomato & greens with literally NO mozzarella! Ugh! Terrible. The vegetarian tomato soup that came with it? Also terrible- flavorless and more of a thick pudding-like consistency than soup!

Luckily the cookies seem to taste the same, but they don't have all the options they used to. I haven't seen a delicious molasses cookie or a fab lemon zester cookie since Paradise Bakery cleared out of this place. What a shame. Definite downgrade. End of an era.

This place is trash. #TwoThumbsDown"}
{"text":"Service was incredible from the moment we walked through the door until we left the building!  Great suggestions from the lady behind the cash register!  

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE that the chicken is anti-biotic free as I usually eat organic, and yet I had no idea about this place.  

The bread that comes out with the french onion soup (delicious) is heavenly!!  OMG!!  So much for no carbs last night!

I had the Asiago Roast Beef.  It was good but I would try something different next time.  The kids Mac n Cheese was scrumptious!!

Will definitely be back, very soon!!"}
{"text":"We like Panera. Food is healthy and value priced. We order with the iphone which is simple, accurate and fast."}
{"text":"Always a good stop for my morning ice tea. They now have multiple teas to choose from at the fountain which is nice. I would love to see them offer some additional non-dairy, egg,meat items such as a chia pudding or oatmeal with multiple fruit and nut toppings."}
{"text":".              GREAT SANDWICHES  (STAFF, TOO)  
          Don't let senseless reviews keep you away.

I just scanned over posts for this location---others, too---and was surprised at the number of low stars, and the reasons.  Some---in chilling detail---were enough to make my skin crawl.  No hard-working, minimum wage employee doing their best to help a customer, deserves the deriding, even hateful, comments I read.    

We've been to this location a few times in the past two years, and everything---food, staff, service---has always been fine. Clean, too. Complaints about pricing?  Delusional.  They must be comparing Panera's pricing with fast food places.  Here you get above average ingredients and an excellent food to cost ratio.  To make a decent-sized sandwich at home, using artisan bread, cheese, and specialty luncheon meats (up to $9+ per lb.) can easily cost 3.50-5.00.  What all mean-spirited reviewer-thugs will never get is that food industry employees are not their personal indentured slaves but human beings deserving respect trying to make their few bucks an hour, and that pricing goes toward convenience, too, and a place to park their vicious, miserable selves.     

I'm making a conscientious effort to stop here more often when I'm out and about, rather than other places.  I tend to forget about Panera because I rarely drive this stretch of Center Ridge.  I call it the Ghost Strip---that forgotten half mile between Westgate and Wooster Road---where several businesses have either closed or moved from.  A shame.  Hope this Panera is doing well, will continue to, that they remain open, and that anyone who's never stopped here, will.     

.         Smoked Ham & Swiss on Stone-Milled Rye
.  Roast Beef on their excellent Asiago Cheese Bread 

Had these last week.  Both an easy 4 star.  Soups and salads, too, are very good.  Have had just 3 or 4 different pastries/cupcakes, but not over the moon with their sweet assortment.  Try---you might find favorites.

{"text":"I paid for a near $10 sandwich... and asked for 4 pickles. The guy read off my order twice and he even checked in the bag and there was 1 extra pickle. Why are they so stingy with pickles????? My sandwich probably cost panera $1 .. they can't throw in a couple extra pickles??? This is my 3rd time ordering from this place and each time I have requested an exact number of pickles.. i am pregnant and want my pickles!!!"}
{"text":"After along time of avoiding this place because of mixed reviews and not being in the mood for soup and sandwiches I decided to give this place a try since my fiancé loves it so much.

I was quite impressed with their menu variety. You can mix and match what you get and their pastries for sure won me over.

Needless to say I underestimated this place, enjoyed my food and will return."}
{"text":"I enjoy Panara and can count on the food being good.  This specific location though had slow service and grumpy workers last night.  Also, no lemonade or green tea at the drink area.  I was disappointed."}
{"text":"We got there at 6 o'clock on a Friday night and it was pretty empty.  The girl that took our order was pleasant.  We each ordered the pick 2. I got the steak with white cheddar on a baguette with New England clam chowder and he got broc and cheese soup w a turkey sandwich. My sandwich was no bueno.  It was basically a bunch of red onions between two pieces of baguette with a few slivers of what appeared to be roast beef on it.  It wasn't very hot and neither was my soup.  I was starving so scarfed it down anyway.   Ever had room temperature clam chowder?  I don't recommend that you do either. I regretted every bite of it.  Even their fresh warm cookies weren't fresh!  Will I be back?  Sure I will.  I'm a creature of habit and I love Panera.  Hopefully they were just having an off night!"}
{"text":"Am I the last person in the Northern Hemisphere to hear about this joint? Jim Cramer from CNBC was talking about the stock price, I casually ask wifee \" Have you heard of Panera?\" 

\"Hahahaha ...dummy\" was her less than polite response.

So I seek out Panera Bread. On W.Lake Mead & Rainbow it's easy to find. I've driven by about 50000 times but today I stop in. Very busy parking lot needs a few drive arounds to find a spot.

Once inside it's PACKED! Every table & booth is full. Lots of super nice helpful staff.
I order a Chicken Cuban panini and a soda. I'm offered a side of chips, apple or bread. I choose apple, it's actually an apple , real not slices in a packet. Excellent . I wait about 2 minutes and the sandwich is ready. Simply fantastic, tasty, hot melted cheese on ham & chicken. I think a top 10 sandwich of all time in my lifetime. Cost almost $11 for sandwich & soda but worth it.

Parking aside, a class act."}
{"text":"I visit at least once a week & every visit is a great one. Even on evenings where almost every table is occupied, the feel is never one of overcrowding. My favorites are the Steak Chili & Caramel Latte...Highly Recommended!!!"}
{"text":"My first time visiting Panera and I was seriously underwhelmed.  In such a competitive market, I'm shocked that this place hasn't tanked! I was there last week for a meeting.  Walked in, was pleased at the atmosphere and the displays, ordered easily and uneventfully.   The cashier thst took my order was really helpful and friendly.  That's where my pleasure ended.

Got to the table, my pecan roll (looked like a cinnamon roll with pecans all over) made it there fairly promptly.  At least 20 mins later, after the people meeting me showed up and had their orders delivered,  I went up to enquire with the cashier about my latte.  I had expected a slightly longer wait than had I ordered a drip coffee, but this was ridiculous.   The cashier remembered me, was shocked that I hadnt received my beverage yet,  and went to enquire.  The manager (?) And other staff were arguing about who they were making their current beverage for (19ish beverage, 30h staff...) and she was getting totally railroaded.  I had to forcefully state what my order was (as I honestly didnt care who they were making their current beverage for), and the cashier assured me she would take care of it.  5+ mins later, I got my overpriced coffee that was honestly, not quite up to the quality of I'm used to.  The pecan roll was so dry that I couldn't even bring myself to finish half of it and when I asked my group to try it (wondering if I was just being hyper picky), they all agreed.

This group I meet with has typically met at Panera but we've already picked a different venue for next month's meeting.  A cluster for service and inferior product (when even McDonald's is making better lattes. ...) means epic fail for this location!"}
{"text":"I live right near this location so I am a frequent visitor of this particular chain.  

The food is in my opinion just as good if not better than the other chains. However some others chains in Charlotte don't always match the quality.

What I really love about this Panera is the staff. They are all very friendly and always looking to enhance your dining experience. Not to mention they have a sense of humor and don't find it an issue to explain something to a customer.

Overall a great restaurant that I frequently visit and shall continue doing so."}
{"text":"Worst panera location and I've been to quite a few. They're always out of bread (mainly ciabatta). We went twice because I wanted something fresh and I love their broccoli cheese soup, but they never have bread for my sandwich. The last time I went,  they were out of soup too. The first time I thought ok it's a weekday, they probably don't make that much. Then I was in the area on a weekend for lunch and the same thing, they didn't have the ciabatta bread. The staff was unpleasant to deal with and they got the order wrong twice the last time I was there at which point I gave up and said forget it. I would not recommend this location to anyone and would rather drive up to the one near Erin mills town center."}
{"text":"I work nearby so I go to this Panera for lunch as a last resort. I only get soup and bakery items. I refuse to pay $11 for wilted lettuce or one slice of turkey on a tiny sandwich. The quality is terrible. 

The service is usually ok. But I was once waited on by a manager who didn't speak to me. Not even to tell me my total. But he was very nice to the girl behind me. I haven't seen him lately, hopefully he got fired.

Three stars for the soup and bakery."}
{"text":"Been gradually more and more disappointed with panera in the last few months. They've taken so many good choices off of their menu and still don't have a build your own sandwich...tonight I think we've ordered for the last time. We got delivery from this location and I asked for my bread toasted and extra croutons on the soup...I got neither, actually no croutons anywhere. Just an ok place to eat with an overpriced menu."}
{"text":"DO NOT use for pre-orders. They didn't have our order ready that we paid for in advance and gave us a hard time to refund us the difference. Christa was extremely hard to deal with and wouldn't help us without calling her GM. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Took 18 minutes to get an iced tea, 2 people infront of me inline. The lady behind the counter forgot to put coffee in one customers iced coffee drink. Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Good selection and even during the crazy lunch rush they get you in and out..."}
{"text":"I love Panera Bread! Well, to be honest, I'm in love with bread in general. In fact, my wife gives me a hard time about all of my bread consumption. Nevertheless, this Panera bread is awesome. My wife and I just opened up a new Eyebrow Threading salon here in the same shopping center so I've been frequenting this location quite a bit. I had always heard of Panera bread from others in the past, but I honestly had never been.

Boy was I missing out. They have delicious Panini's, great bread bowls, and although it might seem like a given, they have great bread. The staff is great and we have a couple employees that come by our salon on occasion.

Also, this is a great place to get together with others to discuss business, study, or relax on quick break. They provide free wi-fi that makes this better than stopping at any Starbucks (not to mention they have great coffee as well.)

Anyways, the place is great and I'm glad I've got a location so close so I can stuff my face with bread until I need a nap. Don't tell my wife though. :D"}
{"text":"I travel a lot and have the opportunity to visit different Panera bread.  This one is by far the best I have ever visited.
Why?
It's new, has the classy kiosk ordering and beautiful interior.
The people are excellent and apparently very happy to be here.
Big reason it's the best is it's food quality.
Hands down better than the rest.
Always fresh , always correct, it's great."}
{"text":"After visiting two times this place is mediocre at best. 

Serving sizes are small, the soups are all extremely salty..bacon strips in the sandwiches are paper thin.. and the prices are outrageous. 

I understand that this place is suppose to be healthy and does have healthy options which come at a premium price, but there's a certain threshold where it goes from premium pricing to complete rip off. This place pulls out the rip off card. 

Overall. Meh. After two visits, I probably won't return. I can't see how this chain survives."}
{"text":"This Panera location is great for west-side folks heading downtown, hospital employees and east-siders who are headed out west. They have limited, but nice outdoor tables with umbrellas for shade. There are quiet areas for studying (free wifi), a separate glass-divided room for business-style meetings, and booths for meeting friends. Always have fresh coffee for you to order throughout the day. Employees are cheerful and efficient and the overhead screen helps verify the details of your order for you. The general feel of the place is sunny/natural light and airy. This location also allows you to modify/customize your orders, so I request chicken and a toasted bread option for the Turkey & Avocado sandwich and love it! To save time order ahead on line and the pick up area is just to the left when you enter the 2nd set of doors. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here unless you're unbelievably desperate, completely devoid of tastebuds, or have a condition where you must eat at a food joint that is mostly employed by d-bags. Went here with a friend last night and not only were we ignored when ready to order, there was a tension so thick you could pour it over a stack of pancakes. The cashier and one more employee actually decided to help us while the immature little boys behind the counter were F'ing about. The owner/manager/whatever needs to reevaluate his or her hiring methods. 

Now for the food...I didn't eat my sandwich, honestly, for fear of them spitting in it. Yes, we took a long time to figure out what we wanted, but was the attitude we received necessary or justified? I ate the ham, from my ham and Swiss, after close inspection for any indication of saliva. It was super processed, so I finally ended up just eating 3 cookies (I REGRET NOTHIIIIING!!) to be safe. The chicken Alfredo my friend got was pretty good, but the chicken on top looked pink and as if it came from a can. 

In the immortal words of Dave Chappelle, \"I wish I had more hands so I could give those t!tt!es four thumbs down!\" Suck it, this location...suck it hard..."}
{"text":"This is a decent Panera store, and I come here regularly because it is close to where I work.  I typically do rapid order pickup but on occasion go in to order, and typically the service is a bit slow, hence why I order ahead using their app. The staff are generally pleasant enough but yes, they could be friendlier, but I've never experienced anyone be rude to me.  I find the store and bathrooms to be neat and tidy and have never thought that the store was unclean, but again I rarely eat in, so maybe I'm not there long enough to witness this. The food is decent quality even if it is a bit expensive, but I'd choose Panera over fast food any day.  They offer a lot of healthier options than other quick take out places, and they do their best to use natural ingredients and provide nutritional information/calories for each of their items, so that makes eating their convenient and easy if you are tracking your daily intake.  Overall I think they are as good as any other Panera that I've been to, so I plan to keep going back.

Be sure to sign up for Panera's Rewards program - even if you only eat there once or twice a month, you typically can get freebies every couple of months.  Also try the Rapid Pickup order by using their app to place your order ahead of time - this is really convenient and makes getting in and out a breeze!"}
{"text":"Nothing here to see. After three failed visits I can confirm that this restaurant is crappy. Food lame, portions are xtra lame. Prices steep for what they're serving. Now just to be fair; this location is in the middle of the hood. So perhaps a nicer area puts out better food and service idk"}
{"text":"Not horrible but not exactly impressed. We bought two sandwiches two cups of soup and chips. Total was $21. 

The sandwiches were only half sandwiches. The cups were small and my chicken noodle ingredients were weak and lacking. The ingredients were gone in three bites leaving a weak and watery broth.

My GF ordered tomato soup and said it was average but nothing special. I took a taste and had to agree but I'm not a tomato soup fan. 

Our half sandwiches were good but we both desperately wanted our missing halves. It came with some kettle chips that were very good and its a shame that I believe the bagged and processed chips were the best part of our meal.

We both looked at each other at the end of the meal and said do you want to go get dinner now? 

The staff was pleasant and accommodating but I did see the delivery team walking back past dirty tables and not stopping to clear them so maybe they arent motivated to keep things clean? Makes me worried about how clean the kitchen maybe.

If you aren't hungry and like to get average food for 4star prices this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"People are usually in a flat unhappy mood while at an airport. I usually add a star to the composite star rating of anything at an airport. It's crowded, all places have rip-off prices, and people are in a hurry. 

I stopped at Panera it was near my flight (almost to the end of the C terminal) and I wasn't in the mood for something fried, I didn't want to suffer the indignities that follow hours after Mexican food, and I didn't have time to get boozed up. 

I ordered Panera's Mediterranean Veggie, an magnificent melding of feta, sliced tomatoes, red onions, lettuce, peppadew peppers, their in-house cilantro-jalapeño dressing, cucumber, salt, and peppers, all on their tasty tomato basil bread. While there are \"build your own\" options, I think they got this one just right. Also note you'll get a bag of their  kettle chips to polish off along side your savory sandwich. 

Unless you think your order is too complicated for the mind of the 19-year-old blonde girl manning the register, I recommend just going to the counter. I used their kiosk and it took longer to get in an out. 

While the 10-minute wait time is a little much for an airport meal, the end result proved well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to the Panera Bread at Central and Thomas Road in Phoenix for a few years and the service has gotten worse and worse. 

- On several occasions when we place our order online we either arrive to an order that is missing the loaf of sourdough bread or we get a call 5 minutes before we arrive saying they are out. I have gotten into SEVERAL discussions with the poor excuse for management at this location. When I ask him why they don't make enough bread, or why he couldn't call us so we didn't waste our time stopping in to pickup he has ZERO answers. 

- Yesterday, I placed another order for 2 sandwiches and a loaf of bread. 5 minutes from arriving I got a call saying they didn't have the bread, yet again. In addition, they didn't even have wheat bread for one of the sandwiches.  When I spoke to the manager I asked him yet again, why they didn't make enough bread? His response was that a large catering job came in. I told him I placed the order early in the morning and mine should have been set aside. He indicated to me that with their system they don't even see my order until 15 minutes before its due for pickup. That is either a complete lie, or the most asinine system I have ever heard of.

The manager doesn't care, the area is shady."}
{"text":"This particular location needs to get their act together. Sadly, it's the one closest to me. It pains me a little to give 2 stars because Panera food is really good. If this review was only based on food, I'd give 4-5 stars.
But this review is about the Metro location and how they roll.
Today, they forgot my Thai chicken salad. Last time, I got a half sandwich but was charged for a full one. Another time the girl at the drive-thru was in a rush, practically threw the bag my way, it fell and landed on the ground. Guess who had to get out and pick it...in the rain? Yup, you guessed it. Awesome. The reason for drive-thru is so we don't have to get out of our car, sheesh! 
I'm still bitter about not getting my Thai salad today. I didn't check the bag before I left the drive-thru so maybe it's partly my fault, too. Guess I just expected the food I paid for to be in the bag. Imagine that?!? 
Next time I want Panera, I'm heading to Arrowhead. Haven't been to that location yet. 
The top of my receipt says Accuracy Matters... (insert eye roll here)."}
{"text":"Too expensive for the mediocre food. I had the soup and salad. I had the turkey and artichoke sandwich (extremely dry, the bread was the only good thing. The turkey was horrible). I also had the barbecue salad (this was a little better than ok). If I got a great I might eat the salad again, but that is a huge if!"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of Panera in general. Kind of a pain location wise, Parking can be rather tough. Not the cleanest Panera either. Tons of other options around here to consider."}
{"text":"I love this Panera! It is on my way to work so I stop there often for both breakfast and lunch items. The good thing is you can pick up a salad for lunch at 7:00 a.m. if you need to. Their food is always fresh and my order is always accurate. The people working are friendly and pleasant. Two other benefits are their rewards card that gives you freebies and their Rapid Order system. You order and pay online and your order is waiting for you to pick-up. My order has never not been ready, and has never been wrong! Love, love, love that feature. You bypass everyone waiting in line and are in and out in minutes."}
{"text":"The Diet  Coke is very good to go at Panera Bred. I came in today and orders a breakfast sandwich. When the young man brought it to my table he sat it down and walked  away fast. He did not being a dork and a knife. I know this is a sandwich and I should be able to eat it with my hands but I want a fork and knife. I followed him to the serving area and got my own. The food is not good. The. Older was old. I asked the cashier if I could trade my coffee in for a to go cup of Diet Coke. She had to check with a supervisor. I just paid for a Diet Coke and left. Last time I'll by food at Panera. Love the Diet Cokes to go."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of going to Panera today. It's not even noon yet and they're out of half their stuff. No chocolate chip Muffy and no Berry salads. Somehow I can buy berries at the grocery store but they can't make a berry salad. I'm surprised I can get my soup. After all it's only noon. There a disappointment more than a restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is a mess. It stinks of sewer. I heard other customers talking about it. Its 10 and I can't get soup because even though they have it they don't serve it. They don't have the souffle I want. That leaves about three other things for breakfast that I have to eat or go somewhere else. Guess I have to go to Wildflower."}
{"text":"I usually love Panera and eat at this location without incident. The past two visits however, were a different story. Today there was no cheese on both sandwiches and the panini wasn't melted. I was really looking forward to the Gouda and was very sad that my cravings weren't satisfied. The last time a couple of weeks ago 2 items weren't put in our to go bag. Workers are all super friendly though. I will still eat Panera, just not at this location."}
{"text":"As a first time pregnant woman (2 months along) there aren't many food options that I can keep down. I am so grateful to have to found Panera bread! The chicken noodle soup is beyond amazing and I'm sure I'll be eating it everyday for quite awhile! It is honestly the best chicken noodle I've ever eaten. Even better than my grandmas homemade :)"}
{"text":"Staff are always friendly and quick and their busboys are suoer nice and helpful. Their manager is the best and know customer service that retains regulars, this is why they are the only restaurant chain still making money during hard times. Panera is the best. Their food is great and their rewards card is awesome."}
{"text":"I've been to this Panera Bread too many times to count. When I was younger, I always ordered the broccoli and cheddar soup, but as I've grown older, I've expanded my palette. 
I recently ordered half a frontera chicken panini and a cup of black bean soup (pick 2) with a French baguette and a peach blueberry smoothie with almond milk.
All of this totaled around $13, which was pricy for lunch but worth it. The black bean soup, despite being only 90 calories, was fulfilling and flavorful. The frontera chicken panini changed my perspective of paninis forever. The bread was crispy and had the perfect crunch. The melted mozzarella with the shredded chicken was absolutely delicious.
The French baguette never fails, and the smoothie was not bad. (Strawberry Banana is better.) The service was nice and very polite, and I didn't wait more than ten minutes for my food.
Overall, I've become a recent Panera Bread fan."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery today and my order arrived just fine. But there was someone else's order also in my bag. I called the store immediately and spoke with the manager, gave them the customers name and they thanked me for letting them know and informed me they were making a new order for the customer. In a perfect world that's where this all should've ended b/c you're not legally allowed to re-serve food in this way. Well a few minutes later the driver called me and asked if the order was at my home. I told him yes and that I'd already called his location and they were already making a new order. He asked me if I had done anything with it - I said yes I placed the salad in the fridge b/c I have no use for it now but the soup and bread were still in the bag. He said \"yea I'm just gonna come pick it up now\" Um ok. I placed the salad back in the bag and handed it off to him when he came. His reasoning for it - your closer to the person than the store is. Having worked in food service this is so not allowed and is a violation. Makes me think twice about every time my delivery was late for whatever reason they gave."}
{"text":"This Panera is pretty good. The food is always consistent and the employees are efficient. They are usually walking around to help clear off tables too. My only complaint is that I wish this location was bigger. It is always very busy, and often times, there are no tables available. Otherwise, this Panera is nice, and consistent with your typical Panera experience."}
{"text":"I spent $10 on a half-grilled cheese and a cup of broccoli cheddar soup here. Not sure which one did it, but the meal gave me extreme food poisoning that I'm still feeling 3 days later. My mother (a nurse) thinks it was the soup, as cafes like Panera leave the same vat of soup out all day, but I have no idea. I just know I can literally never eat here again, which sucks because the cookies there are amazing."}
{"text":"Honestly - I am basing this location's rating from one experience.  I have to. It was just the greatest.  Went through the drive thru fairly late in the evening because they are the only ones who stay open so late on a Sunday.  It was probably 30ish minutes to close. Ordered my usual pick two with soup and a 1/2 sandwich.  When I got to the window, the very kind gentleman at the window advised that they were unfortunately out of the Tomato Basil bread that usually comes on my sandwich and asked if I would like the white bread or something else.  Their bread is always good so this is fine regardless.  I really don't mind whatsoever.

The gentleman then hands me a receipt without my giving him my card to pay and he said this one's on us. What?! You didn't have to do that, Panera!  I was more than happy to pay for my meal but they insisted because they didn't have any more of the normal bread for my sandwich. That's excellent service there. That one act will keep me coming back over and over again."}
{"text":"Panera has done a nice job at creating what appears to be a gourmet coffee/sandwich/pasty shop. The store is big and has plenty of seating. 
I've tried a few pastries recently and their muffins and such are pretty good. The menu selection is also decent, though I've yet to have a sandwich here. They had a summery fruity beverage a while ago that was pretty good, and I don't know if that is still offered. 
I joined their e-mail club and they send out quite a few offers via e-mail. You get a free pastry on your birthday, for one!"}
{"text":"I've heard of Panera Bread a couple of years ago but I never stepped foot into one until last week. If you are on gluten-free diet then this is the place you don't want to go to since majority of the food items include bread.

My sister and I arrived during the slow hours (3 pm) and man was the service slow. There was no one else in line except us and the customer in front of us. The manager (I'm assuming) took his sweet time taking their order that I was ready to leave. We waited at least 5 minutes just for him to finish one order. When it was finally our turn we ordered a hot chocolate, chicken noodle soup, and a warm cookie. It came out to ~$11! I could've went to Tim Hortons and spent half that amount.

The seating area is a bit small if you were there during a busier time. However, it's nice and homey.

I doubt I'll ever drop by Panera Bread due to the long wait time, cost, and I'm on a restricted gluten free diet."}
{"text":"I came in around 5pm and it wasn't busy at all. Tables were cleaned, cashier was extremely friendly, the cookie I purchased was warm!!! I love this place and can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Can I give ZERO STARS?? Rip off. Complete rip off. Go to salad and go you get a giant salad for the exact same price as this tiny piece of crap."}
{"text":"2 of my girls got food poisoning after eating Chicken Alfredo here.  sick all night & ended up not being able to play in their championship volleyball game after flying from out of state. On a positive soup was good."}
{"text":"Consistency...  that's a good thing about Panera.  Whatever location you go to in Charlotte (or anywhere else) the menu and their offerings stay the same so it's a pretty safe bet if you are looking for something comfortable to choose from as a far as menu offerings go.

I had the sesame chicken salad and it was good as always.  Light on the dressing and tasty.

Didn't have a bad experience, but it seems like there is always a line.  Probably a good sign, but it sucks when you are trying to save some time and be somewhere else.

This location is pretty busy.  The parking lot is very awkward.  I think they were going for the \"what looks pretty\" versus functional.  If you can navigate into a parking space, you should be good to go.... just watch out for those other... (cough) Ballantyne drivers and the possibility of damaging some pricey vehicles (even if it isn't your fault)."}
{"text":"So this Panera is downtown in the Charlotte Plaza building (same building as the Carolina Ale House & Charlotte School of Law).  Like all things downtown, this Panera is in a compressed space, but it's impressive how they configured everything to make it feel like a stand-alone Panera set up.

There are a ton of \"fast-lane\" kiosks to try and handle the lunch rush that usually happens in Uptown.  This morning the line was free, but I didn't feel like explaining my order to a person so I went straight for the kiosk.  I know - call it \"impersonal\" but some mornings I just don't want to deal with anyone until I get something in my belly and some coffee.

The staffer that brought my food out was pretty friendly and my food was exactly how I wanted it.

There's an outdoor patio space to eat on, there is also an \"outdoor\" space in the lobby of the building that has tables you can be \"outside\" of the Panera, but still be sheltered from the elements."}
{"text":"I've spent a lot of time at the hospital lately... and it's not a fun place you \"want\" to be, but this Panera provides a good fit for when you get sick of the hospital cafeteria.  Granted I will probably not come back here unless I am in the hospital again, but I think it's a great option for healthcare providers and patient's families while visiting.

Everything here is made \"to-go\" and there are a ton of rapid pick-up spaces... I've never seen the shelves used, but I'm sure if this location gets slammed with online orders and in person orders, they can perform \"triage\" to help ease the lines and crowds... sorry for the poor hospital pun.

They've got a lot of kiosk stands here and a nice screen that shows which orders they are \"preparing\" and which ones are ready.  You can even order online as well.

Configuration of this location is long and narrow with a small seating area in the back and a couple booths with a large communal table on the side.  Wifi is available for both the hospital and panera which is nice.

The other nice thing about this Panera is that it makes you feel like you aren't in a hospital if you hang out and work here... take a break from the hospital upstairs.  Staff is friendly and get the job done.  I was \"anti-panera\" a while ago, but I think this place has won me over."}
{"text":"The staff here was so pleasant and friendly. The manager that was working this last Sunday was awesome. She was genuine and incredibly respectful."}
{"text":"Where's the bread, man?   Well right here at Panera!  And not just bread but pastries, sandwiches, salads, coffee, and more.

I was out in suburbia and looking for a healthy late lunch and ended up here.  I have to say that out of all the Paneras I've been in (about 4 now), this one is laid out the best.  All the seating is on one side of the restaurant and the lines flow normally.

The food is consistent with other panerals.  

The only flaws I see here are the booth heights are odd. Either the seat was too low or the table was too high which meant my food was closer to chin level than stomach level.  Also, staff here was average for a food joint.  I didn't find them as friendly here as with other Paneras."}
{"text":"I was very happy to see that a Panera opened in Phoenix. Panera was my favorite restaurant back in Michigan where I'm from, so I was glad to try it out. 

The food is good and while I agree the price is a little high, it is comparable from what I remember. The problem is the service. It seems like the staff has no idea what they're doing and they get easily confused. While I was waiting for my takeout, they had to ask what I had. It took nearly 10 minutes to get my Chicken Caesar Salad, and the restaurant was slow. I suppose they were growing the lettuce from my salad from the garden because it took so long. 

The staff is not rude - they're very friendly - just a lot of disorganization."}
{"text":"Coffee is as bad as it gets, weak!  Food is generally ok soups when hot are good."}
{"text":"PANERA SUCKS I miss paradise bakery . The remodel is aweful . Feels like your eating fast food or your at Panda Express . Prices went up and options and perks went down . Why screw up a good thing . And WHERE IS MY DAM PASTA SALAD :( ugh . No free cookie w the buy one get one , the lady asks if I want a French baguette and I asked if it was the same as paradise and she said yes . I got white dinner rolls and the other cashier tells me they no longer have French baguettes . Cookies we're definitely not the same quality - get your shit together PANERA cause this sucks"}
{"text":"The worst Panera I have ever been to.  One of the worst places in the C-U. We went there to get some bread, and stood in line for 5 minutes while receiving awkward looks from their employees.  No one came to help us or take our order.  There must have been at least 10 employees standing around, doing absolutely nothing, ignoring us.  It was so bad we left, along with the other customers behind us.  Do not waste your time at an establishment that cannot be bothered to take your money."}
{"text":"It was rainy and cold tonight and ALL that I wanted was some broccoli cheddar soup. I decided to brave the weather and the MESS that is N. Tryon construction all around Panera to get my fix. I pull up to the drive thru and wait my turn. Of course my luck would have it the person at the window is getting a multiple large shopping bag size order passed through the window. When it's finally my turn, I begin to give him my order and he says that they are OUT OF BROCCOLI CHEDDAR SOUP! You know... the most popular soup... the everyday soup... the soup that probably put them on the map. OUT OF IT! I was in the drive thru around 7:30pm and they are open until 10pm, It wasn't like I was there 10 minutes before closing. Which means that the cheddar broccoli soup was low around 630/7PM... which means MAKE SOME MORE! I know you got all the ingredients in there Panera. When you see your most popular soup is low WELL BEFORE closing... MAKE SOME MORE. This to me is just poor management. I will think twice before visiting Panera again."}
{"text":"I always enjoy Panera! 

Great fresh food! Yummy soups, salads, and sandwiches! Don't forget the great pastries and goodies! Love the iced tea varieties! 

Love this location- great atmosphere!

Always a good choice!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and even if you walk in just before closing, they still serve you and seat you. They will wait untill you are done, no pressure. Great Staff, Great Prices, Great Food."}
{"text":"I've come to this panera once a month or so and each time I feel as if it's 6pm or after, they always run out of bread bowls or whatever item I enjoy. I'm not sure if the lady working the register was new or not, but she told me she wasn't sure if she could add a bread bowl to my soup for the pick two option. I found this quite confusing. Also, when I asked iced tea flavors since I couldn't see it on the menu with the light shining so brightly, she told me she wasn't sure. If that wasn't frustrating enough, after my order was placed through and paid for, I was told there were no bread bowls left, so they thought giving me two pieces of bread on the side was compensation. I should have been given my money back or some type of compensation for a better replacement for what I paid for. I'm sorry but this was poor service in my opinion and I do love panera, but I'll be taking my service elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"You pick two is usually the way to go! Half sandwich or flatbread ? Soup ? Half salad ? You pick two! You also get a side of either bread, chips, or an apple. 

It's usually pretty healthy here. I chose the broccoli cheddar soup and the roasted turkey cranberry flat bread. The soup was yummy as expected. The flat bread was just okay, I don't think I'd get it again but I wanted to try something new. It was kind of dry and hard at some parts. I'll have to opt for the salad next time.

Tip: if they get your order wrong when it comes out, you get a free pastry! So keep an eye on that."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to this panera bread simply because of the location. They're located on flamingo where a few hot spots are located, down the street from UNLV. Their service is friendly and you can never go wrong with a You Pick Two.. two choices of either 1/2 salad, 1/2 sandwich, or soup.

I love panera soup and salad. I don't normally go for the sandwiches but the ones that I have tried were actually pretty good. This trip I got a grilled cheese and tomato soup... the bread was pretty hard and the soup wasn't hot at all. I was very disappointed. At least the 99 cent pastry kept me going."}
{"text":"I enjoy Panera and it is always a good place to go to meet with family members or for a business lunch (we met with our wedding photographer in a PNera the first time to look at her work!). The one in Strongsville has nice outdoor seating and is spacious inside. I have always had great service when I am there. I like how the calories are posted on the menu and a few faves are the mac and cheese, bacon turkey bravo sandwich, and baked potato soup!"}
{"text":"Panera is always a great option for lunch. They have a wide variety of sandwiches, paninis, salads and soups. The store has always been clean and the service quick and friendly. I like the pick 2 option for a 1/2 sandwich and a 1/2 soup or salad. The brocolli cheese and bistro french onion are my favorites. 

The bread is always freshly baked and the it seems the quality of the meats and cheeses are very good. Panera is always consistent and will continue be one of my go to lunch spots."}
{"text":"It is all about Rapid Check-In. Without it I would not frequent Panera that much. It just makes my life so easy and so simple. No lines, no waiting just order and pay online and BAM! it is ready when required. 

I'll spare you on the food - you already know since it is a chain. No complaints. Always good and fresh and I am in love with the soba noodle bowls. Best thing they have ever added to their menu."}
{"text":"Served raw chicken in a salad.... the manager said it's pulled chicken they don't make on sight and gave me a refund for the salad. Seriously disappointed. So gross we loved Panera but this location leaves a lot to desired. 

At least the kids Mac n cheese was good"}
{"text":"In general, I like Panera so rather than reviewing Panerai overall, I'm going to compare this Panera store to other Panera stores that I've been to.

I've been here a couple times and so far, no major complaints in terms of food and service. The people are generally friendly (honestly, they are probably the friendliest Panera staff I've seen in all of the Panera stores I've been to in Pittsburgh, although I haven't been to them all). Once, I came in after breakfast time and asked for a quiche and they gave it to me without any problems. I haven't had to wait super long, even if there are a lot of people. 

However, my biggest problem with this Panera store is that there are hardly any outlets and seating is rather a pain. I like to go to Panera to eat and do work at the same time but it's rather hard when there aren't many seats and very few outlets.

Food: 4 stars - just your average Panera food
Service: 5 stars - as mentioned, pretty good experience
Seating: 1 star - don't come here to work or come with a huge party
Overall: 3 stars"}
{"text":"I have been a Panera customer for years now. I love their food because it's clean, simple, and pretty healthy compared to fast food. I love their coffee and that you can sit there for a while and work. And I love that their prices are not too expensive and you don't even have to pay tip. So when it comes to Panera, I usually have nothing bad to say. 

HOWEVER, this Panera was a pretty big disappointment. NEVER in my life have I experienced worse customer service. Although some employees are okay, overall, the staff is just TERRIBLE. I've been there several times and it is just ridiculous. Some of the previous reviews say that they are understaffed but I don't always think that's the case. Once when there were hardly any customers, it took almost 5 minutes before someone even took my order because they were all in the back and didn't see me at the register waiting. And they don't always refill the coffee pots, even when there aren't that many customers. Once it took them almost half an hour before they realized the pots were empty but they had in been the back and didn't notice. They are almost always in the back or even just sitting in some of the booths.

My worst experience was with this girl at the register who was taking my order and she had the worst attitude ever. She was just plain miserable and did not want to be there. She was leaning on the counter and resting her head. Not ONCE did she even look up at me. Her voice was completely monotone and she was sighing every other sentence. I did not want to even hand her my money because she was so rude. 

But it is not ALWAYS this bad. There are some employees that are friendly and smiling but the bad seeds are just making everyone look bad. This Panera REALLY needs to go over customer service with their staff and pick out the bad apples because, as you can tell from their ratings, they keep falling.  

To end on a good note, the food there is pretty good. They don't skimp out on anything. Even when I order a salad, it is a pretty good amount because they give everything in good portions (including salad dressing sometimes, which isn't always good). Some of the reviews say that they take a really long time to make the food but I've never experienced that (yet...). 

Food: 4 stars - you really get your bang for your buck but it's just the salad dressing that kills me...
Bad seeds: -5 stars - they are PRETTY bad
Good seeds: 4 stars - they are pretty nice and I've never had a problem with them
Location: 4 stars - I like Bakery Square, although I mostly only go to the LA Fitness and Panera there
Parking: 5 stars - Bakery Square has 1 hour parking in front and a garage that has 3 hours of free parking
Overall: 2 stars"}
{"text":"Panera Bread is a steady growing company in the US but has not done well in Canada.  I've seen quite a few come and go from various locations in the GTA.
This location took over after another big company in the US made a huge attempt into the GTA - Krispy Kreme Donuts.
For all intents and purposes, the formula is right for success.  They make good food and bakery products.  The big thing is that their prices are a little high for what they deliver.
I usually order a breakfast sandwich and a coffee.  Hot off the sandwich press and so superior to a McD offering.
I can set myself down and get some work done with their decent WiFi and have a good start to the day.
Their reward program is great too.  This month, it's a free bagel with every trip in.  Their bagels are large, chewy and very tasty.
They also have a good lunch catering offering too.  A sandwich, salad/soup and a cookie/chips."}
{"text":"The 19 or 20 years that was in charge of the entire store named Jade refused to sell me bread because they were saving it for customers who MIGHT come in and order certain sandwiches.  I'm not sure how a franchise could be so short sided to have a girl who is barely old enough to vote to be in charge of a store and customer services. This isn't the first time this has happened either.  This store is a joke...stay clear."}
{"text":"I came here finding out that Paradise Bakery had closed (which is fine cause I only enjoyed their cookies). The food was bland, expensive for what it was (taste, quantity, etc), and overall not worth it. The staff was just ok, but I had to get up to get my own utensils (which didn't come with the food served). Skip it"}
{"text":"went in for some pasta and some pastries 
amazing as always"}
{"text":"i LOVE this place, great food, a little bit on the expensive side, but amazing flavors and a wide spectrum of items. GREAT milkshakes as well
awesome awesome lunch place"}
{"text":"They're training an employee and the line is 6 people long and not moving. Although they have someone training her and numerous people walking around and watching her fail, NO ONE will jump on any of the other three registers while we all give them dirty looks and stare. Hello?!? Do you not want my business?? These people in line are trying to give you our money!!!! Ugh"}
{"text":"I love the salads from Paradise.  They always taste fresh.   The sandwiches ( especially the chicken walnut salad) are yummy too.  The thing I like the best is the mango tea.  It is brewed and very good.  I do wish the service was a tad faster but they are always pleasant."}
{"text":"Panera Bread is the most overpriced bland food I have ever tasted in my entire 34 years on this earth. I bought a 11 dollar sandwich that had less meat than a lunchable. Please just don't."}
{"text":"Ok they've really improved in just a couple months as far as friendliness and I'm kinda addicted to their mac and cheese now. Cons, prices are still really high for lots of items and what you get, and they haven't fully transitioned to Panera. Their to-go bags all advertise being able to order online through Panera but their site doesn't recognize this location yet. I hope this happens soon because I hate having to explain customized orders over the phone or the wait times when doing so in person. Other than that, their attitude here has shifted a while 180! Food is tasting better and fresher, (Big kudos to Jacob, by far the friendliest most helpful person there, everything he did was with an honest smile) every employee I talked to was telling me that they hoped I have a great rest of the day and it actually felt genuine and not like they are trying to rush you out or saying it because they have to. I left with a smile on my face and in a much better mood because of it. Also I didn't realize that if you register your Panera card you get a month of free drinks, nice perks!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Panera. Whenever I want a tasty sandwich or a meal that will make me full without feeling guilty, I come here. The You Pick 2 option is great! I usually order the Chicken Caesar Sandwich. The chicken is cut into good sized pieces and the three cheese bread is awesome. A very tasty sandwich, although it can get a bit messy. The Mac and Cheese is my other choice. There is an extra charge for this, but I don't mind because it is so delicious, hot and creamy! My husband likes the Bacon Turkey Bravo Sandwich. I have also tried the Roasted Turkey & Avocado BLT in the past, but did not like it. For some reason, it was very bland, even though it had bacon in it. The sweet tea here is also pretty good. Its not overly sweet like the one from Mcdonalds, 

You may have to wait a while for your food, but the good thing is, they don't make it until you order it. Customer service is usually pretty good and friendly. Recently, one of the cashiers charged me for a cookie that I did not order. I didn't notice that on my receipt until I got home. I mean, it was only 99 cents, but still, they need to pay attention to these things! I sent a complaint through the company's website, and got a email from one of the managers who apologized and told me to print out this email and bring it in on my next visit for a free pastry. I still have not had a chance to use this, but what I don't understand is that I have their MyPanera card. So, why couldn't they just add the free pastry to my card? Wouldn't that be easier than me bringing a printout of my email, explaining it to the cashier, the cashier calling a manager over, causing confusion.....geez, it will take me 10 minutes just to get one pastry that I already paid for! Ridiculous! 

Speaking of the MyPanera card, I really don't understand this program, LOL. Its free and the cashier swipes this card whenever you purchase something. But, it doesn't keep track of any \"points\" or how much you spend. Apparently, you will get \"surprise rewards\" according to what you like to eat, and the more you visit, the more \"rewards\" you shall receive. Very vague! I come here at least twice a month, and the only thing I got was a free pastry on my birthday. 

However, I do like the food here, so I will definitely be back. 
Current hours are 6:30 am - 9:00 pm daily."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this wasn't my first time trying Panera I would never go back!!   this place is a disaster!! ...Dirty, soup was cold and small amount and the worst of all... served with plastic cutlery!!!   As we sat and looked around others were eating soup out of to go cups!!! If you want a step up from wendys at double the price its for you...if not tay FAR AWAY from this place !!!!"}
{"text":"Yep I'm a Panera Bread Fan ! The Sandwich's are always awesome, I love the Turkey Bacon Bravo with extra Gouda Cheese and now the soups are in with the colder weather. Broccoli Cheddar Bread Bowl is a must have......Go check it out if you haven't..... to me its worth the price for great quality food."}
{"text":"I love Luke and Ashley and the rest of the staff at this location. Been going for 5 years and will continue. Thanks for always doing a good job"}
{"text":"Sooo loving the new selection of Broth Bowls! Lentil, quinoa, kale and spinach, tomato sofrito, and chicken, in a soy-miso broth with a lemon wheel... under 400 cals. Yes please! I could eat these every. single. day. 

Ordered for rapid pickup tonight. They were fairly busy but my food was ready right on time! A few mins early, actually. 

I *Love* Panera!"}
{"text":"Yep, it is a Panera.  Same as the other thousands out there.  But I did find the people working at this one to be very friendly.  For OK tasting soup and sandwiches in a family friendly atmosphere this is a good option."}
{"text":"Terrible. We have an executive level meeting and put in a large order and were told they could not deliver anything hot. Basically nothing on their menu except chips and salads. We will never order from here again. Horrific customer service."}
{"text":"The employees were very friendly and the service was quick. However, I ordered the chicken avocado melt full sandwich and once in the car I realized they only gave me a half sandwich. Also, the avocado in the sandwich was black and didn't look super fresh... Overall, the sandwich was pretty yummy and nicely flavored, but I was just unsatisfied with the quality."}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty clean and the employees are friendly. Overall, the service was mediocre because I got a pager for my food because I was dining in, yet it never buzzed. After 15-20 minutes, I checked the counter and my food was there... I felt like they should've paged me another time if they saw that I didn't come to pick up my food. 

The food was average- the mac&cheese was very rich and the BBQ chicken flatbread was very drippy (sauce kept on dropping out). Overall, a decent meal, but in my eyes it's overpriced for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"This was my first time using the drive thru and it was great! There was no line at all and I was gone in 2 minutes, and this was at noon. Usually I do rapid pick up but I wanted to bring my dogs this time so I was grateful for a drive thru and the fact that it was quick because I work from home and only get a 30 minute lunch break. The food was good although the chipotle chicken sandwich was much lighter on the avocado than usual and a small part of the chicken was kinda rubbery, but I'm very pregnant and easily grossed out. Overall it was still delicious, my dogs just wished they had doggie treats at the drive thru!"}
{"text":"Recommend- Mac and cheese, turkey chili was ok as well
Please avoid- Thai wonton soup- this soup was disgusting - seriously they need to take this off the menu
The iced teas are always refreshing thankfully. Overall- will come back, but not a favorite of mine anymore, the manager was nice enough to give us a refund for that horrible soup, but this time I think I will stick to the classics, price wise this place is a bit expensive for semi-fast good..."}
{"text":"The only reason they get one star is because I have to. Having worked in the food industry I know what is okay and what is not and a big black bug in someone's sandwich is definitely not okay. I will not be back here ever again. Thanks but no thanks panera."}
{"text":"Usually come here for a quick coffee or smoothie but today they did a brother wrong. Placed an order using the kiosk and I was out and on my way. Little to my knowledge my smoothie was more like a \"roughie\". If I'm gonna spend $5 for a smoothie, there should no chunks whatsoever left in my cup. Can I get an amen?"}
{"text":"There are some pretty mixed reviews on this location over the years, but I've had all positive experiences with this Panera. I can tell over the past year, in particular, they have been making efforts to come across as friendlier when you walk in and when you order. When ordering from Panera, my interactions fit into these three categories:

(1) Online/mobile ordering for rapid pick-up: my orders have always been correct and fresh. I even throw in weird-ish requests like adding spinach, tomatoes, changing out the bread type, and I've always gotten the right meals. I forgot to explicitly request my baker's dozen bagels be sliced one time, and when I called they fixed that easily and were very nice about doing so. Make sure you do this! unless you're picking up bagels and not eating them that day because we know sliced bagels will stale faster.

(2) Catering orders: they delivered on time to a spot on campus. Some of the cookie and salad orders were mixed up in the boxes.

(3) Dining in person: they keep the dining area, soda fountain/silverware/napkin spaces, and restrooms clean. It can definitely get loud during popular mealtimes. Their disposal areas a little confusing, and it's hard to tell if they have a recycling option for some of the trash.

The parking is pretty easy, and their hours are early and late enough for what I need (without the infamous undergraduate all-nighters in my life now). It's definitely worth signing up for their rewards program too! They send out random freebies like one free bagel everyday for a month or free coffee everyday for two weeks. I like free things, and of course, they pull you in so you'll buy something else rather than walking away with just your free coffee (but I have the willpower to do that on occasion too)."}
{"text":"Hearing all about the US chain, I was pleasantly surprised to walk by this location in Toronto.   Love that they post the calorie content of their food on the menu (to add to your guilt, but it does help make better choices).  

I had a grilled cheese and house salad, and it was tasty.  The atmosphere here was social, it was very busy and buzzing.   The experience here was enjoyable, and the bread was delicious.   I can see what the hype is about."}
{"text":"The staff are very friendly and they've offered great options for my food inquiries. Once I wanted a breakfast sandwich with pork and she suggested the brioche breakfast sandwich with roasted turkey. It was delicious suggestion/substitution."}
{"text":"Cute cafe-like/date-like, zero loud crazy families. A chain, whatever. But their French Onion soup is so amazing!

I had the Smokehouse Turkey Panini, chips on the side, and a Creamy Tomato soup. The panini and soup was quite small but it was very good. 

My date had the Asian Sesame Chicken salad and French Onion soup. His soup was SOOOOOO good!!! Very sweet. That's really the reason I'm writing this review... I really liked it!

After you place an order, you are given a ticket gadget (sorry I have so few vocab in my brain) thing that you hold on to as you find and wait at a table. When the food is served, they know exactly where you sit with this gadget. HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT? Is there a GPS tech under the table that tracks your seating? 

This place is usually very busy. Families come here (with well behaved children), dates come here, students are here, chatty older women are here, there isn't enough seating for everyone especially since these aren't the eat-n-go groups. Nonetheless, we were lucky to find a table and it wasn't crazy busy when we visited for a fine Saturday brunch (2pm)."}
{"text":"1 star because I can't give zero. I drove 30 minutes just to get french onion soup, chicken Chipotle sandwich, french Baggett and mountain dew. Apparently they stopped carrying all those items except the mountain dew. So I ended up with loaded potato soup (so bland), a \"dinner roll\" (so dry) and a deli turkey sandwich with tomato basil bread (as good as a cold cut sandwich can get that you didn't make yourself) so disappointed that I have multiple gift cards that will never get used since I'll never be returning again."}
{"text":"Gotta love Panera's pick 2!! Definetely try the baked potato soup!! I love Panera. From their addicting pastries to the yummy sandwiches, it's always a hit. like the chill atmosphere here too; you can come inside and study or get some work done (FREE WI-FI!). The employees at this Panera are awesome! Super friendly and helpful! :)"}
{"text":"Awful customer service at this location! Appalled by the lack of respect let alone customer service. I felt like my business was not valued nor was my complaint rectified or remedied. Shameful."}
{"text":"A few observations...

- They have a drive thru.  When I went the drive thru was packed.  I don't get the drive thru.

- The building was built from the ground up.  The patio is on the west side of the building.  Who does that?  How do you not put it on the east side?

- The place seems oddly small.

I ordered the onion soup and cobb salad.  Soup was good but was not especially hot.  The cobb salad was good but the dressing (vinaigrette...I wanted blue cheese but they don't have it) had that odd preservative after taste to it.  Could have done without the after taste.

Not sure I'd go back as there are other similar establishments that I like more."}
{"text":"I love this chain restaurant. The food is always good and relatively healthy. I love it that they change their menu once in a while especially during holiday seasons. I always get their 1/2 sandwich and soup combo. You can choose among a variety of soups ( in this location they had clam chowder and it was as good as in any good fish restaurant!) they also include a pastry for only 99 cents. How can you beat it? The place is clean and the service is fast. We will come back."}
{"text":"Great environment and atmosphere for reading and studying. I would definitely recommend it place to hang out for lunch or dinner.  They also have great soups and salads."}
{"text":"Great customer service!  The staff was great from signing us up for Panera as well as giving menu suggestions.  We ended up liking the Panera so much that we placed a catering order for 15 people right then and they all enjoyed it as well.  Thank you for a great lunch and we will be visiting more Panera Breads in the future.  Hope they all are as good as did one!!!"}
{"text":"It's Panera so you know exactly what to expect food and service-wise. My go-to is the \"you pick two\" sierra turkey and broccoli cheddar soup. I think I get it every singe time.

This particular restaurant is usually pretty clean and it's conveniently located in a plaza with other essentials - grocery store, bank, etc. This one is far enough from ASU's campus that it doesn't get too swamped with students during the school year. Free wifi and some nice booths and seating areas so you can get work done. 

My last visit here I tried their passion green tea and it was perfectly sweetened. I'll be back for some more of that deliciousness throughout the summer!"}
{"text":"They are so nice. My boyfriend and I came here early in the morning for breakfast.  We came a bit early and they still served us our food before opening time."}
{"text":"$40 for two adults and one child to eat lunch here? Charges for extra when omitting and substituting an item such as chicken for bacon by $0.75 and gives you one crumble of bacon? Staff is friendly but floors full of debris and bathrooms stink horribly. No thanks! When the manager Brian was at this location it was great...new manager needs to get a clue. Clean your establishment and stop being so skimpy on your toppings because you'll loose customers in the long run!! Choosing to eat elsewhere next time because it's getting old with this location."}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafe spots in town! Great food and food selection. Awesome and friendly service every time!

Broccoli and cheddar soup melt my heart"}
{"text":"This was my first Panera Bread experience. On our way to New York from Chicago, we stopped to have lunch. Choosing mac and cheese was a big mistake. My brother had the large size and I had the small but the portions were baby portions. $6 for the small and about $10 for the large size kind of a rip off. 

They have the pager system like Shake Shack which is good. I may give a try to their other food option but no more mac an cheese :) Not again. 

P.S. Still might be the best option to eat within this resting place."}
{"text":"My go to spot for lunch dates with coworkers! I am in LOVE with their chicken walnut sandwich and the blue cheese crumble salad.  This specific location gets really busy around 12 so try lunch at 11 or 1 :)  The staff is pretty friendly and helpful.  I always get worried at the beginning of the line that I won't get a table but the staff here are pretty quick at clean up so there's always one available."}
{"text":"We had a gift card regifted to us from a family member that's gluten-free.  It was pretty smart on her part to send it packing as there is very little on the menu she could have.

First:  parking is pretty awful.  The lot was packed and we easily would have driven away except for the gift card thing.  People were creating parking spots.  Upon entry you are hit with the bakery and the food menu/cases with what feels like limited space to wait.  A team member gave us a \"detailed menu\" to browse through and there are a few kiosks to order from-I might have preferred that instead of being pushed for their Panera Perks card and being asked if we wanted a \"sweet treat\" three times.

The food was fine and I don't mean it rudely, it just was fine.  Nothing amazing and nothing awful.  I do appreciate the switch to delivering to the table.  Worth the trip, but I'm not sure I need to often."}
{"text":"Look who's hungry? My favourite broccoli and cheddar soup in a bread bowl.   free wifi"}
{"text":"I love going to this Paradise Bakery location at 12th street and Glendale. The staff there is excellent and the food is wonderful. My favorite dish is the steak and blue cheese salad"}
{"text":"Rarely do I get offended enough to write something like this and I give many chances. Where to begin. So I work about 5 minutes from this location and get food delivered to my work probably two times a week. The past 5 times I wasn't given a fork or spoon for my soup or salad and had to write under special instructions to include them. Like it's not that hard to give someone a plastic spoon and fork. It's really not

Today is what pushed me over the edge though. So since all the inconvenient orders that have been delivered to me I brought a granola bar so I wouldn't have to order from them ever again. The lady who usually brings my food comes in with food and just hands me the clipboard to sign and I said wait I didn't order food and all I heard was her say it was placed by someone named \"Ailey\". We have a bailey and kailee at my work so I just assumed they ordered food for when they came in to release me from my shift in two hours. I sent our work group message and sent a picture of the food and said bailey or kailee your foods here. Both were confused and said they didn't order it. I realized Panera made a mistake and I put the food in the back room to wait for them to come back for it or call when work slowed down. The lady comes back 30-45 minutes later and I have a lobby full of customers and she cuts in front and I say \"oh hey yeah she said she didn't order that\" and the woman (I kid you not) yells \"WHERES THE FOOD THEN\" I said ma'am I put it in the back there's no need to be nasty about this she said \"why the f*** would you sign for it and say she's coming in later go get the food now I can't believe this\". I give her the food and tell her to have a good afternoon. This all going on in front of my customers at my works busiest time. Much appreciated. I am not looking to be compensated or apologized to I just hope a manager sees this to maybe get someone to teach this woman how you treat another human. And to include forks and spoons for orders on soup and salads."}
{"text":"This is a pretty busy Panera location. I walked in around 11:45, just before they got too busy. Ordering was quick and I waited at the pick up area. Their process is very quick and they seem to be quite streamlined to get all the food out in a timely fashion.

My soup was basic. I like to pick up pastries from time to time, namely the pecan roll, but they are good for what they are. As I was walking out, the line had already tripled in size and it was out the door, so make sure to avoid peak times here."}
{"text":"This is a pretty typical Panera Bread location. It's always best to come early to make sure you have first chance at all the pastries. My favorite is the pecan roll and those go fast, so by the afternoon they're always gone. 

Service is friendly and solid. They get very busy during the breakfast and lunch rush, but if you go before or after, you're good."}
{"text":"I wish more chains had great quality foods and ambience rich environments. I thoroughly enjoyed my roasted turkey, avo blt!"}
{"text":"I do miss Paradise Bakery.  They were much better than Panera, even with a similar menu.  In fact, thank goodness they kept some of the Paradise Bakery menu items, because Panera's alone doesn't cut it.  This place feels cold and empty.  Hard to describe but when you're there you'll understand."}
{"text":"This afternoon we went to have an early lunch. We beat any lunch crowd that there would be. There was one person working the register, a couple talking at the sandwich station, and a manager rejecting a customer complaint. We waited forever to order, paid a lot of money for what turned out to be a bowl of lettuce with some salad dressing and some sort of thick squash soup that was literally too sweet to eat. ALL of the coffee pots were empty, all of the tables were dirty, the carpet was covered with trash and crumbs everywhere. We did let them know that there wasn't anywhere clean to sit, but ended up cleaning up a table ourselves to sit. They didn't fill the coffee until after we had already finished with our food thus not getting a drink until the last minute of our stay. There were no apologies given! 
I am willing to overlook a bad day at almost anywhere. But this was not our first bad experience here. We will not be returning! There was absolutely NO redeeming qualities what so ever. I implore you to skip this place and visit any other restaurant! You can't go wrong going some place else!"}
{"text":"Whoever works here early Friday mornings is a complete bitch.  She had a complete attitude and when I said thank you m, she looked right past me and on to the next customer.  I'll be writing corporate!"}
{"text":"I hate rest stops.  If you've ever driven on I-95 through Maryland or Jersey, you come to expect crappy food from rest stops.

Not here.  I had to stop to get cash in order to pay the tolls, so I was super excited that there was also a Panera in the rest stop.  The Panera looked just like a regular Panera, but cleaner.  I was suprised that the store even had the full menu.  I stopped at an off time, around 4 pm, and someone took my order right away.  I ordered a greek salad and coffee, and was back on my way in minutes.  Everything was as I would expect from a regular Panera and was delicious.  Prices were reasonable, too.  

If I'm ever back on the turnpike, I know where I'm stopping!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Panera Bread & live in CA.  So when I was here for a work convention I was so happy to see Panera so close to our resort.  I love the look of this particular location.  The staff had colorful shuts on and the vibe was very pleasant.  I wish I could remember the name of the cashier, she was really friendly and I felt at home even though I was from out of town.  

The food was great though my tuna sandwich seemed to be a little shy of the amt of Tuna I usually get. It was right in the middle of the lunch rush so I know the line was probably crazy.  

Still enjoyed the food and of course I never miss a chance to get the pastry upgrade!!"}
{"text":"I've really never been a fan of Panera Bread after a number of quite average meals.  Thus, it's never been on my list of go to spots for lunch or any other meal.  But... I have to take it back after being dragged (and that's not too much of a stretch) to the Uptown location on College Street yesterday.

My colleague recommended one of the pannini's so I went with half a smoked turkey/bacon and a cup of creamy tomato soup.  I will officially admit that both were quite good with the soup being just a tad better than the sandwich.  Beyond the food, I appreciate the calorie counts on the menu board and the choice of an apple as one of your sides.  I of course chose a baguette and proceeded to snag a bunch of butter packs (real butter, another plus), but still, it's nice to know there's a healthier option for when I am being good Tom.

All in... Good show Panera"}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken salad sandwich on a bagel. The bagels dry and tough very little chicken salad on sandwich at all.
The texture of the chicken salad was almost runny.
And all this for nine dollars not worth the money not worth my time.
Hi price for almost nothing."}
{"text":"Went to Panera today, got some bread, it was fine.

Hate this location, wish they would put one in under the parking garage by the Beckman.

Panera appears to be almost identical to Au Bon Pain, except that it is in the midwest instead of on the east coast."}
{"text":"I was not surprised they only had two stars, and now maybe this will knock them down. I am ok with that. I ordered a chicken sandwich with NO tomatoes and onions. I watched them put tomatoes on it, and then I complained. They took it back to fix it. When I finally got my sandwich I discovered all that they did was scrape them off the bread! It had the yucky tomato seeds and juice all over the lovely sandwich. I complained to the manager; if I had an allergy it may have killed me and then I could've sued (if I weren't dead). Not happy at all with this place."}
{"text":"I come here to do research because the wireless is pretty fast, but I am pissed that there policy is to filter whatever the hell they want. The food is just ok. The soup is average and the salads are pretty good once I modify there regular ones. I don't like their sandwiches at all. Really, I only come here for the ice tea. I like free wireless and I like ice tea.

They need more booths with outlets, and they need to turn the AC DOWN! It's FREEZING in there!"}
{"text":"I came here after having a bad experience at a different Panera & I'd hoped they'd be better. I ordered a chicken sandwich with no tomato or onion. I can't stand either of those and they make me sick. I watched the man make the sandwich and put both on it; he cooked the sandwich and then put it on my plate. I asked if tomatoes were on my sandwich. At this point he turned around and read the order (which he hadn't checked earlier since he was flirting with the women employees). He mumbled an apology and took it back to the counter. I watched him take the lid off and scrap the veggies off the top. He then put on more sauce and handed it back to me. 

I knew this was coming, so I told the assistant manager what had happened and told her that I wanted her to personally remake it. She was younger, rolled her eyes, but then acquiesced. It was remade but neither the manager or employee was happy. I wasn't either because I was giving the franchise a second chance and they blew it ---again."}
{"text":"As this is my first time here I didn't have any expectations. The ambiance is modern, light and open. The food was excellent. I ordered the half steak and arugula sandwich with a half chicken ceasar salad. Everything was very tasty and delucious. Didn't have to wait long either. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This is not a top-tier Panera, it's just okay. The staff wasn't friendly nor were they unfriendly they were just folk doing their job.
The food was consistent with other Paneras but there was nothing special about this location or the team.
They gave you a pager to let you know when your food is ready. However, when your food is ready a team member yells your name to pick up your food. I'm not sure what the pager is for...wait I do. You're to gaze at the technology with wild amazement.
We ordered our food to go but they served it to eat-in. They corrected it with no problem.
If we're in the area again I doubt we'd stop by as there are other options available."}
{"text":"This location is the best one in town. I'm truly blown away at how great a \"fast-food\" chain could be. The ingredients are always 100% fresh and clean, and they are never ever stingy with their food. Whenever I order online for rapid pick up it's always ready within 5 minutes and it's ALWAYS accurate. If you go to any other location in town, like the rainbow location, they are stingy and don't give you a proper sandwich, and their lettuce is dry and blackened. This location is definitely the golden child. 
Also, they don't have true vegan options but almost anything can be customized to be vegan!"}
{"text":"Worst experience and waste of money! Waited over 25 minutes to get a wilted, over drenched in dressing salad and a cold sandwich that should have been hot. I waited for another 20 minutes for a corrected sandwich. I wish it was still Paradise Bakery. Save your money and time and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"\"You've checked in here 3 times! What keeps you coming back?\"

TBH I have no idea! Panera is always a lot more expensive than you expect it to be for the amount and quality of food you get. It's not terrible, but it isn't really that great, either. 

The reason I keep coming back is because this is one of the few places in Henderson I can think of to get a good salad / sandwich / soup combination that at least feels somewhat sort of healthy. 

I have never dined in here, but the cashiers are neutral-to-moderately-friendly. The search for delicious salads in Henderson continues!"}
{"text":"The sandwich and soup was delicious. Awesome Cobb salad and mini bites of chocolates chips cookies. To top it off Karen had welcominh smile and service. She made us feel welcome, really excellent customer service."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here and the WiFi is horrible!  What a waste of time, gas and the dining experience.  Not to mention now I will surely lose an hour or more of study time; depending on where I go next. I don't understand why Panera cant seem to upgrade.  If the mom & pop coffeehouse can have a decent speed WiFi and Panera has way more customers (more revenue) whats your malfunction?   And this location especially because its directly across from UNCC

Why, oh why did Jackson's Java have to close down :("}
{"text":"I had breakfast here on a Saturday morning. I ordered the strawberry poppyseed salad which came with 3 options for a side and i chose an apple. I wanted something light, healthy, and refreshing for breakfast so this salad hit the spot. My order was ready unexpectedly quick, after only about 3 minutes of ordering. Casual atmosphere, great for meetings or just a relaxing place to sit and eat."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't have to go here as often as I do! I sincerely wish my 3 year old didn't like their mac n cheese but she does and so I'm forced to go. I inevitably order something gross from the menu with the hope that I might find something that I like. This has never happened in the last 2 years. Here is what I have had most recently: Chicken Caesar salad, Thai salad, Asian chicken salad, chicken soup, squash soup, and a chicken sandwich. My resounding feedback on all these items? Yuck. The chicken is poor quality and fatty, they use cheap iceberg lettuce on the salads which has almost zero nutritional value, the soups are bland/taste gross, and I didn't like any of it. I always throw away about half of my meal after picking out the majority of the fatty chicken. I feel sad because I am wasting food and my money. The small bread loaf that comes with the salads is pretty good. Hello carbs! Even the ice tea (all of them) taste weird. I know this because I tried them all searching for one I liked. They were weak and had a weird, chemical taste to them. I do agree with my daughter that the Mac n cheese is good, that's about it. Not 5 star good, more like good for a kid who doesn't eat any fancy food. It's not healthy either. I see grown adults in line at Panera and Paradise Bakery and truly don't get it. Are they all ordering the Mac n cheese?"}
{"text":"Bad food always eat my stomach hurt same happened to my family last time my wife vomit 
 I complained couple times they don't take any action ...."}
{"text":"Food would be worth it if it was priced in HKD"}
{"text":"These guys literally ran out of bread.  At Panera Bread (emphasis on bread).  That's like Taco Bell having no Taco!  Like Burger King losing its Lordship.  Like the Pizza Hut out of a shack.

You get the idea.

They made our sandwiches on slices of wheat bread right out the bag.  Date night hit an all time low.

Kid in the back just yelled an F-Bomb and dropped a tray of dishes.  With all the banging around, its  like we're right there in kitchen with them, not making bread."}
{"text":"This is by far the Best Panera Bread I have ever been too.  Brand new, clean and the food us terrific!  Eric and staff run the place like a finely tuned machine. Food came out hot and tasty as can be. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Love coming here on my lunch breaks. Always relaxing atmosphere, Delicious and healthy food. Also Casey is my favorite, she always friendly, helpful and even remembers my name."}
{"text":"Really nice place, always very speedy and so friendly for take-out orders! I highly recommend this Panera!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came at night. After we ordered we noticed most of the tables were dirty, and the staff was ridiculously immature. In other words, don't go to this location after 6PM"}
{"text":"Order Online site is overly difficult to use (I am a Millennial so it is not for lack of understanding) and does not allow for building a breakfast sandwich from the ground up, but instead forces you to pick what you don't want and customize it to what you do want. 

Our cashier was slow, and not particularly friendly. If I assume she was hand picked by management to be a front line employee with direct customer contact then I can't imagine who is being held back to only execute the food orders. But I got an indication as  
our order was executed poorly with one of our bagels, literally dropped into a bag without being wrapped in anything else with a plastic knife and a cream cheese cup. 

This location is directly competing with other purveyors in very close proximity that offer a similiar experience. The service at drive thru's is better and the food at other walk up and order bagel shops offers a better executed meal. 

As I look across the overall reviews for Panera valley wide I see a trend, which to me indicates that there is a lack of customer focused leadership from the corporate level. 

There is no need for management to respond as I am not interested in an explanation, but thought it would be nice for you to understand why you have lost my business. Feel free to share with your overlords."}
{"text":"This Panera Bread is the biggest location I have ever seen. The staff was friendly. The restaurant was super clean and our food was delivered to us fast. Not to mention, my specialty order was taken seriously. 

I will be coming back here more often."}
{"text":"When Panera bread opened I got excited because I usually have to drive 15-20 minutes to get there. I saw that they have a drive through which is very convenient. I actually went inside today and the ambience was like the other Panera bread restaurants I have been to. The staff welcomed me with a hello and the cashier was very friendly. I chose the spicy Thai chicken salad with an apple on the side and I even got a bonus bagel because my Panera bread rewards sent an email saying the whole month of May I was chosen to get a free bagel. That was a great incentive to have me come to Panera more often this month. The salad was good and I love how you can order a 1/2 salad because I'm not a very big eater. Something that I haven't seen before is they had a screen with names saying the order is being made and another screen saying that the order is ready, which is super convenient so that we don't have to go up to the front to ask how much longer to wait."}
{"text":"Sadly, the manager n crew aren't living up to Panera's standards. Bn to many n it's never bn this messy after the lunch crowd. 

At least the broccoli cheddar soup is hot but its texture seems from an instant packet. Still tasty tho. And, my steak & arugula sandwich with Asiago bread has a tangy, sweet sauce that overpowers the steak a bit. Wish the bread was fresher for the price of a \"sandwich.\" Tasted the autumn squash soup n boy is it super sweet. This Panera needs to readjust n start test tasting."}
{"text":"Everything was tasty but our Asiago bread seemed stale, day or two old. We frequented the Glastonbury CT Panera quite a bit when we lived there n its Asiago bread was made daily n served fresh. Leftovers were donated to soup kitchens so u knew u were getting fresh bread and y not since you're kaching paying for it. Sure I'll eat supermkt bread throughout the week at home but it's cheaper. This Panera's Asiago bread felt sweaty, not dry on the outside n it was not as flavorful. 

Tho, I can say the U-Pick-2 salad was a good sized serving n very fresh, tasty. 

We will frequent here because we still love Panera n WholeFoods is right behind it!"}
