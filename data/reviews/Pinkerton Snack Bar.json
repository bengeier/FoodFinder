{"text":"Food was great. A very unique and interesting menu. Loved everything we had. The two of us shared three plates which was enough for us. Particularly enjoyed the pork neck pancake and the sous-vide chicken. Service was attentive and friendly. My only complaint would be the music volume. It was so loud, I basically had to shout to my dining companion in order to be heard. Other people didn't seem to mind, though, the place was packed."}
{"text":"Love that we are getting a place like Pinkerton in Leslieville. I hope the rest of the neighbourhood catches up. Great place for an after work hangout or date. The interior is nice, beautiful bar, tables in the front, along the narrow corridor and cozier dining in the back, somehow it all works. Great music, I feel like I'm listening to my iPod.

Their food is OK. Nothing has wowed me yet but it's good, just not special. I'm hoping their menu will revolve and evolve. The drinks are all bar standards and they don't have any original drinks which is a little disappointing in terms of originality but at least no surprises and you're guaranteed a solid drink. 

I recommend it to all those in the neighbourhood to go out and support this establishment and get it on the map. May not yet be worth the trek for west enders."}
{"text":"Went last night for the first time, sat at the bar with my husband and had such a fantastic time. Drinks are amazing but FOOD is unreal. We had pretty much everything on the menu ... bao, duck neck pancake, meatballs, chicken and tartare ... Delish! Thanks Adam for a great evening."}
{"text":"Now that you guys are the best bar in TO you guys are gonna get even more rammed. I say move to the old start bucks location at jones and gerrard, 2 floors with a roof top!"}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood bar..actually a great bar in general!  While the drinks and snacks are excellent, it's the atmosphere and the service that really shine.  The staff are always friendly, the decor is sharp and the owner genuinely cares about his customers. Great place for a date or meeting friends."}
{"text":"416 Snack Bar knock off for the East end, and apparently just as popular! Great Asian-inspired small plates, fun, bustling atmosphere, excellent selection of brews and cocktails, including a proper hand-pulled cask ale. Wish it was closer to home, but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, drinks, service and vibe.  I'll be back!  The BC Tuna tostada was amazing."}
{"text":"Pinkerton's is a great new spot on the East end! The food is great and the cocktails even better! Definitely come for both. My husband and I tried the entire menu (they are mostly small sharing type plates) and each dish was very unique and delicious. I highly recommend the calamari and the beef tartar, both were a standout for me, but everything was delicious. The cocktails were all amazing too, the bartender is meticulous when making them and you can tell the craft put into each. The paper plane was incredible. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I actually really love this place and the service is great...until we got the bill for a group of 6 and gratuity was already added (18%, which i don't mind because I would have tipped 20%).  

However, if you're going to auto grat a group it's a good faith practice in the industry to let inebriated guests know that the tip has already been added and that you thank them.  I want to believe (based on how nice the servers were) that they weren't trying to be sneaky and get tipped on top of the tip already embedded in the bill, but it's easy for customers to feel duped when businesses don't let you know that it's there."}
{"text":"Total New York joint! Low key but fun. Music is on point. Food is delicious. Great date spot! The tuna tacos and Korean broc are two of my faves. A new local fave"}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  However the music was so loud we could not hear each other. I love high energy places but this was like being trapped on a factory floor. The music was night-club pounding  loud. When we asked our server about why it was so loud he merely shrugged and said customers liked it. Will not return until we know they dialled it down a bit."}
{"text":"I hate to be the one to break Pinkerton's 5 star review streak. I really really wanted to love the place, one being that it is in my old neighbourhood (Riverdale) and second it is a snack bar closer to where I live now.

We tried a number of items off the menu including the beer tartar, calamari, chicken special and the pork neck.  Mind you the menu only has 7 items we were less than impressed with the food.

Chicken special was good, the chicken is sous-vide then deep fried. It was very tender and moist, sauce was good but not overly flavourful just OK. 

Calamari was battered and fried well.  They topped it with soy sauce which i personally found not nessesary as it made the squid too salty. Dish came with a soy,sesame, teriyaki type sauce which was also very salty topped with jalapeños .

Beef tartar- was...dry? Even with the quail egg mixed in it was not moist almost seemed that the beef sat out too long and dried up. The flavor profile was uninspirational. Similar teriyaki type flavor topped with cilantro and jalapeño. It was way Over salted even though we asked if it was a very salty dish (as sometime beer tartar is too salty at other restos as well). 

Pork neck was probably the best of four. Tender pork on top of a pancake again, in the same flavor profile as the other dishes (teriyaki type sauce, cilantro and jalapeños). Again this dish was also over salted.

It just seemed much of the same flavors in each dish. In my opinion if a place is only serving up 7 items they should all be unique. The wait time for food was about 40 minutes when there are only about 6 tables in the entire restaurant it was very slow."}
{"text":"Awesome - Sunday night 3for special is a great way to test out the menu, will be back...again and again!"}
{"text":"Great Korean Tapas Bar with Friendly Service
Surpassed our expectations - the four of us enjoyed seven of the nine menu items. Each item was delicious - pork neck pancakes and mushroom cabbage rolls were the best."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there, Sunday special 3 dishes for $30 is great deal, all the dishes tasted really good, especially the pork neck pancake!!! The staff are really welcoming, service is attentive and warming. Had a really great dinning experience there, will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The East is definitely having a renaissance. Pinkerton has great cocktails, amazing food and an awesome neighborhood vibe. The service was spot on despite how busy they were. Place is usually packed! Steamed baos are a must. Head on across the street at Poor Romeo if you can't get a seat."}
{"text":"Was strolling on the street to grab food from a burger spot + everyone in my party felt that Pinkerton blew whatever food we could have had out of the water! It was extremely yummy and had an amazing drink selection  dope decor and super cool art in the bathroom if in the area definitely come check it out"}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

Nice little spot in the east end of downtown Toronto. Really busy for a weekday, tight space, and we sat right by the door. The decor and ambience was great. 

Recommend getting the tuna tostadas, porkneck pancake, fresh oysters

Don't get the curry shrimp prawns (very bland)

Food was a bit overpriced in my opinion for tapas."}
{"text":"This is the best nightlife / bar / cool bar on Gerrard East. Awesome vibe. Always packed. Tons of great beer choices. Food was great. Gerrard needs a few more of these."}
{"text":"Love this place for late night drinks, fairly chill with awesome music selection and a decent bar. Not tried the food yet but it all looks great."}
{"text":"Walked in on a real hot day with my girlfriend and a friend of ours. Quickly glanced over then menu and decided to order it all. Didn't regret that one bit, everything was fantastic, the sous-vide Piri Piri chicken was absolutely unreal. They also had a guest bartender that night who was making some fantastic summery cocktails. The staff was super well informed and friendly. Would be back anytime when in the neighbourhood. Do yourself a favour and give it a try."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food, because I never had a chance to eat there. However, a review should include more than what I thought about the food, or the environment.  I attempted to make a reservation for a party of 8 people.  I called the establishment, emailed, Facebook messaged, and posted on the Facebook official sites wall, inquiring to my request. After 6 days without a response, I heard from a friend that they don't take reservations.  I checked the website, and at the time there was no mention of this.

Maybe they do have good food, but I'll never know..."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing! I could go through all the individual dishes, but there were too many. My favourite was the tuna tartare. Tangy, spicy, fresh. Drink selection was decent and the bartenders will make (or at least try to) anything!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I were discriminated against by the bar tender for being from the states. Unbelievable that we were not served for not having our passports but still had valid identification. This place was recommended by multiple people in the area and it was a shame it came down to this."}
{"text":"It's been about a week since I was here, and I'm still thinking about what a great place it was. I love the vibe here - the music is old school hiphop/rnb. I love how it's busy but not too busy that you can't get a table and the service is missing. 

The drink selection is also really fun. The cocktails aren't just juice in a fancy glass!!!! They are nicely strong and flavourful for the price point. Lots of ciders and sours to choose from as well - they have a pretty big drink menu.

Unfortunately, I haven't had any snacks here yet, so I'm excited for the next time I'm around the block!"}
{"text":"This place is a little gem! We went there on a Friday night. It was a short wait for a table around 1030pm. Seating is cramped but the ambience is great. Upbeat, good music and just relaxed. We tried the bao buns, squid and chicken special and the Thai mussels. Just excellent. The sous chef Greg brought out some of the food himself and you could see the passion and excitement in his descriptions of the food. Drinks are good as well the beers are priced well, the cocktails are about 12 bucks a pop. 
The service was great! I wish I could remember the servers name but she was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Pinkerton's is really something special. A great local vibe, funky space with a really passionate owner behind the bar (Marc). They have a rotating snack menu that is highly asian which I'm told has to do with the fact they wanted to keep things true to the hood (Chinatown East) I've been several times now and if I didn't have kids, I'd probably be hanging out there a few nights a week. Tall cans, cocktails, and an open mind as one patron next to my SO and i asked for an \"Orange Whipple\" which is from the classic cinematic road film \"Planes Trains and Automobiles\" it's basically 4 fingers of rhum, and 4 fingers of coke and a little lime juice. Marc hadn't heard of it but that didn't stop him from making it for them. I'm hoping that the tuna poke and the sirloin beef Bao stay on the snack list forever, oh and the squid too. Just go and see for yourself: unpretentious and fun."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink and some excellent food.  

Menu is simple and everything we had was excellent.  

Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I ventured in to this cool little spot this evening. The vibe and the environment is so chilled and relaxed, I love it. I live 5 minutes from this place and I think Pinkertons and I are in for a beautiful relationship. This is just my type of place to hang out and grab a couple of beer and let the stress of the day dissolve. The food was A1 as well. I didn't partake however my friends with me had 6 different dishes and couldn't shut up about how delicious they were. That was a good enough review for me. Next time I'll eat."}
{"text":"Wow! Loved this place. So happy there's something like this in the east end. We loved the food, service, decor, music too! Everything had an asian flair and enjoyed pretty much everything.

The good: Bao, Tartare, Pork Neck Pancake (pancake got soggy but it was tasty), calamari (so lightly battered and fried).

The tuna tartare, while tasty, seemed to be missing something (maybe some acidity to balance everything out). 
The mushroom rolls were alright but I didn't love the cabbage skin.

I had the Paper Plane cocktail and it was the best one i've ever had!!

Anyway, great little space and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great resto-bar. Service is excellent and very friendly. Went there with our baby a few times and they have been great. 

Went there for brunch a few times (though I hear they stopped serving brunch which is a HUGE disappointment) and for dinner twice. The tapas style food is excellent. We tried most items on the menu and they were all very good!! Go and support them."}
{"text":"My friend and I were visiting from America to experience the great food and bar scene Toronto has to offer. Every bar we had been to, we had been greeted and welcomed very warmly, and we were offered several recommendations to visit other bars. Pinkerton came up several times, so we decided to walk over.

We were ID'd, and after seeing we were from California, the bartender said that \"We don't serve people from California.\" I naturally laughed and played along with what I believed to be a joke. However after a couple minutes of what I thought was banter, he grew increasingly aggressive and said that we needed to leave. We were shocked that we were overtly discriminated against, and we finally decided to leave and go to Lloyd's nearby, which was much more fun and pleasant. 

This bar seemed very cool and we wanted to experience it. It's a shame that the bartenders and management are either xenophobic or racist, or both."}
{"text":"Is this really happening in the East? With a number of new eclectic bars popping up along with a new brewery almost every other week; I would say yeah, the East is happening..just a little. It's an interesting state of affairs with the old relics slowly disappearing, paving a way for a few new bars and eateries to breath new life into this historic part (more like run-down) part of town. The decay is suddenly not so decaying anymore it seems.

Anyhow, Pinkerton is loud. Almost too loud to hold a decent conversation so it's definitely not the time to talk to wife about baby plans or any other sensitive topics because yelling a spitting in each other's faces might send off the wrong vibes. You don't actually need a conversation here when the beats are loud, food is awesome and the atmosphere is lively; just don't let the tap run dry and keep the drinks flowing. Fyi, this is a young crowd so don't be here if you hate young people.

There's a good mix of small eats to satisfy carnivores, omnivores, flexiterians and even vegan wannabes like me. I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty and thoughtful the menu was (seriously). There are a lot of Asian influences on the menu and coming from an Asian myself, they do a pretty damn good job fusing the flavours of the east with the west. The drinks are decent I would say as they don't have an extensive list of craft beers and exotic cocktails but whatever they serve will satisfy you. The space is a little tight so don't bring your entire extended family.

Real cool loud place to hang with a few friends and enjoy lots and lots of great tapas! Definitely a go-to."}
{"text":"First time there tonight.  Let me put it this way.  I lived in Queen West before it became the hot spot of hot spots. This bar is exactly what Queen East has been waiting for.  Amazing food.  Fantastic staff. Great drinks.  My Saturday night go to spot.  Check it out.  Love it.  Cheers."}
{"text":"This place blew me away. The food is both classy and satisfying. The drinks are made to perfection. They even made my favourite drink: Pisco Sour. Where else in the city can you get that?"}
{"text":"Pinkerton's has generated lots of buzz as one of Gerrard's best spots for cocktails and snacks, so of course I had to check it out and see what all the fuss is about. Verdict: the reputation is well deserved!

We showed up at 7:30 on a Friday night and the place was full. Since the rustic yet cozy space isn't huge, we had to wait awkwardly by the bar (basically right in everyone's way) but it didn't take long for a candlelit table for two to open up. 

We sampled a few cocktails over the course of the evening and of those, I'd say the Paper Plane (a citrusy concoction made with whiskey and amaro) and the Aviation (gin-based with a floral note) were best.

We also tried 3 of their Asian-style snacks and all were fabulous: tuna tostada with creamy avocado on a crispy wonton; steamed bao bun with bulgogi beef, vinegary slaw and Sriracha mayo; and pork neck pancake, full of super-tender meat and rich gravy.

Music (although very loud) was a nice mix of rock gems, and service was very friendly.

Loved it!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot.  Cocktails are banging, the bit size food is delicious (pork neck pancake, come on!!!) all in a great setting with a killer playlist.  Well done gents."}
{"text":"Service is great, but my girlfriend and I got violently ill after having their coconut Thai mussels. I thought they tasted \"off\" but should have known better. Music is also extremely loud (club-like) so you can barely hear what the other person is saying even though you are sitting right next to each other. Be aware."}
{"text":"Really awesome spot. Great beer / cocktail selection and the food & service are fantastic. Stop and chat with the owner Mark, really awesome dude who makes you feel really appreciated as a customer. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Definitely $$ rating for cost. Small \"snack\" dishes are $15-17 which I think is overpriced for what you get. I tried the pork neck pancake which was delicious but too salty, the Thai coconut prawns which wasn't as flavorful as I would have expected. Korean meatball sam was the winner but not worth the money, you can get a full Korean bbq dinner for the same cost. I wouldn't mind paying if the food was spectacular but I can't say it is. It's a tight space I felt like I was at another hipster bar on ossington. P.s. this is the eastend"}
{"text":"Awesome experience.  Super friendly although I'd swear you have to have a full beard to work here!

Food was outstanding.  Everything had great flavours and not your standard fare.  Literally tried everything on the menu in our party.  

We sat at the chefs table by kitchen and made a comment during dinner about an ingredient they had sitting nearby that wasn't on the menu.  Next thing we knew they brought us a special plate.  Will definitely make the drive across the city to go here again.  

Great vibe to the place."}
{"text":"Best bar in the east end.

Stupidly loud.  Always comfortably busy.  A massive constantly changing selection of craft beer.   And the food is wicked. 

Firmly rooted in the 1990s, but a perfect match for the clientele.   This is the shining star on this block.    A place that doesn't take itself seriously, but offers a consistently great experience."}
{"text":"I could spend a whole evening here just sampling different, delectable cocktails and people watching - oh wait I DID THAT ALREADY! What a great place. The salty, Asian-inspired  sharing plates go perfectly with the large selection of cocktails and beers. They use the most delightful shmancy retro glassware that will make you feel like you're in an episode of Mad Men. Fun vibe but tables are very close together so watch that you don't bump the back of that girl's head at the next table when you leave with your winter coat / bag / elbow / butt, which, of course, I've never been guilty of doing."}
{"text":"Great new addition to the hood!! The pigs head pancake and paper plane cocktails were amazing! The place has an industrial vibe with loud 90's music. We went on Friday and it was pretty busy. The place is small and only has about 6 tables but plenty of space around the bar."}
{"text":"Cosy leslieville bar with an intimate feel and super friendly staff. 

The beef tartare was very flavourful with a yummy kick to it. 
The bao buns were also filling and comforting. The Asian inspired shrimp was light but had all the coconutty Asian flavours."}
{"text":"This is what Gerrard and really everywhere needs!
So fun! Amazing spice and savoury flavours in gorgeous-hipster plateware 
Lots of beers nice wine 
I saw cava but only used for cocktails I want it straight up on the menu
Love this place !!!! Very Brooklyn cool"}
{"text":"The addition of 18% gratuity snuck into our bill for two people having cocktails left a bad taste in my mouth. I'd have been happy to leave it otherwise."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and service was solid. Music was a bit loud, but we managed to have a great time at Pinkerton"}
{"text":"The food is really delicious and it's a great place to get some drinks if you are stranded in the east end!"}
{"text":"Was a wonderful meal. Atmosphere is casual, drinks are divine. You know you are in for a treat when the staff is happy and seems genuinely glad you are there. All I can say is go and experience the food the people and the cocktails. You will not be disappointed."}
