{"text":"I ordered a turkey sandwich from Jasper's and would not recommend this place if you want a nice sandwich. The sandwich came with two thin slices of deli turkey, some brown lettuce and a big chunk of the bottom end of a tomato. The man wrapped it haphazardly in some deli paper and just handed it to me, despite me asking for it to-go and have it in a bag. It was definitely not worth the $4.25 or so it cost. For a bit more change, head over to Kiva's or the Italian deli's on Yonge, south of St. Clair."}
{"text":"Better then Tim Hortons or  McDonalds egg sandwich,fast and never a line up"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time for breakfast when I worked closer and I still try to stop by if I'm in the same area. They make really good bagels and also have salad and fruit cups. Perfect for a snack/light lunch. The owners and staff are very sweet and remember you."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and tasty breakfast bagels. Always enjoy my experience here. A better sauce or topping for the sandwiches would be nice though."}
{"text":"Morning commute gotcha down? Stomach grumbling? Best breakfast bagel in the core at Jasper's, $2.99 for two fried eggs, a slice of cheese on a toasted monster of a bagel. Do it! and add Sriracha hot sauce to win the day!"}
{"text":"Fresh and healthy lunches within a reasonable price.  Jaspers Deli has a small self serve salad bar and I recommend the bean salad, vinegar cucumbers and chickpea salad.  I had that with some fruit salad and I was good to go!  The only downside is that they are cash only and do not provide a formal receipt with the items you ordered."}
