{"text":"The Carne Asada burrito was probably the best burrito I've ever had. No need for sauced or anything! Staff was extremely helpful, courteous, and happy. Definitely recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chilaquilas! I highly recommend it! The diet coke was also fantastic, I know that sounds weird but it tasted different, it was really good."}
{"text":"Yummy tacos.  Pastor is my favorite.   Generous with limes which always helps tacos"}
{"text":"Passing by and glad we stopped best chorizo 
And eggs we had in a long time beans,rice and 
Flour tortilla we also very good. Service and prices great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I loved this place! The fish tacos were incredible! The veggie burrito was also very delicious. The two young girls working the counter were super nice and helpful, I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the lunch special, it is delicious and cheap! The best combination in the world. I always enjoy coming here and having authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"The shrimp and al pastor tacos are probably my fav with a Mexican soda YUM!!! Super cheap meal, I think most tacos are $1 the shrimp and fish are a little pricier $2.95 ish"}
{"text":"My friends and I still call it 'Los' and it's my favorite burrito spot. Bean & cheese burrito is the best ever but the entrées are legit too."}
{"text":"The food was good but the dining room was dirty and the trash can was full of trash. Pretty nasty I don't know how this place got a 4 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I tried the red chili pork and I've also had their breakfast burrito. Both were delicious. I only went through the drive through so this review about the food only.  As for the drive thru wait, it was a bit of a wait but the food turned out great and it was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I was Really disappointed with this place, despite my strong desire to like it! The bad acoustics made the yelling kids behind me highly annoying. I ordered the Diabla Chicken Pasta. The guy at the front had no clue what was in it when I asked... Anyhow, it looked and smelled great when I got it. I was soon to be let down. The chicken was way overcooked and crunchy. The garlic bread that came with it was stale and hard. :-(  Sadly, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We ate here on a whim after dropping a friend off nearby. Holy Cripes! It was very good. Tastes like the homemade food your mexican friend's mom makes. I tried the fish taco combo ($5.99) and couldn't finish the entire plate. My girlfriend had the green chile beef burrito and enjoyed it. Said it reminded her of her mom's cooking (hence the reference to the mexican friend's mom's cooking). Blink and you'll drive past it. Awesome!"}
{"text":"SO good! Drove thru last night and got a chili relleno burrito and chips and salsa. Burrito was huge and really good. It had lots of fresh veggies, beans and rice in it. Chips and salsa were standard but good. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Very good tacos for not a lot of money. Carne asada and cabeza are very good. Pastor not my favorite. You can get 4 tacos and a drink for less than $7"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Mexican joint with authentic Mexican food kind staff and great food.  Fresh salsa bar with an avocado salsa to die for which pairs perfectly with their diablo steak burrito I would give it a 100 stars if that was an option. A must if you like Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food is great! I have had their tacos, burritos, and enchiladas. This is my go to place for tacos. My only complaint is the service. The girl at the register is always on her cell phone texting and then forgets part of my order."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was festive. The food was tasty and well presented. They have a variety of Mexican soda, same brands, just made with sugar (not corn syrup). This is more authentic Mexican food, serving head and tongue in addition to the normal selection  (chicken, beef, etc.)."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. I ordered the carne asada fries, and they are bar none the best I've ever had. Generous portions (for one), reasonable prices (on the restaurant's end. If you have this delivered, expect a $6 delivery fee because it's a third party doing the delivering.) Prices, if you pick up yourself, are extremely reasonable for portions this large of food this tasty.

The only downside here is the delivery service -- and I can't fault the restaurant for that, so five stars all the way."}
{"text":"My Mom and I went here for dinner.  I read the reviews and business info on Yelp.  According to the business info, they serve beer and wine.  Unfortunately, that wasn't true so we had to settle for a bottled water.  I ordered a special combo which came with 2 fish tacos and 2 carne asada tacos.  Both were very good but I thought it was odd that the fish tacos were served with a regular size corn tortilla and the carne asada ones were street taco size (mini corn tortilla).  Not a big deal, because they were both very tasty.  My Mom ordered a special combo too, which came with a taco, chile relleno and an enchilada.  She said the chile relleno was really good and would order it again.  The enchilada was just ok.  She didn't elaborate on the taco, but I am assuming it was good because she ate the whole thing.  It didn't come with beans or rice, but you can order it on the side for $1.99.  I requested that but I don't think the girl heard me because I didn't get it and I wasn't charged for it.  That is ok, because I was full.  At many Mexican restaurants, you are served complimentary chips and salsa.  That wasn't the case here.  Not sure if it was something you could order for extra or not.  A Mexican beer would have been great to wash it all down.  Hopefully they will correct their Yelp listing so some other thirsty customer won't be disappointed.  Regardless, I would go back."}
{"text":"I ordered dinner for myself and my kids.  Ordered breakfast for tomorrow too!

This place ROCKS, I just wished they had a SUPER SPICY salsa"}
{"text":"My favorite go to place for Mexican food!! Awesome food, awesome prices!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite go-to places in Mesa. Open till 10pm and always welcoming you with a smile. And the food is great! Affordable, tasty, and so many options! I'm obsessed with their daily special carne asada burrito and their chicken spinach enchiladas. If I ever come here after a bad day, after that first bite into my meal, it's wiped away.

Also, the incredibly friendly and accommodating staff is a HUGE plus for me. On a few occasions I'd arrived with a big group, so we had to sit at one of the outside tables. Even though they were busy, they kindly brought our food out to us.

Sometimes the line to order is long (since so many people love their food), but once your order is taken, service is quick. The atmosphere inside is cute and colorful, and the strung lights on the patio give it a relaxing, almost festive vibe. They have a salsa bar with some other add-ons, such as limes, if you so need. 

If you're ever in the Mesa area, considering stopping by Taquitos Jalisco! I know I'll be."}
{"text":"I think I had th #14 with taco cheese  enchilada an chilly relano..\" gringo spelling\"  for 5.50 cant beat it with a stick.. great deal an the food amazingly good ...very nice 4 the price ..."}
{"text":"This place was so delicious! My husband & I are in town from KC & wanted fish tacos. Freakishly fantastic food! Awesome salsas. There was a line but it moved quickly. Definitely recommend the fish tacos & steak tacos. You will not be disappointed with this place!"}
{"text":"The steak tips in verde and fajitas are always delicious! Best Mexican food in Orlando! Not to mention the mariachi band is incredible not too loud and so talented!"}
{"text":"Good traditional mex in my opinion.  My husband got the al pastor and it was DELISH! I kept picking the meat of his plate.  I had the cheese enchilada, chile relleno and crunchy taco with rice and beans and the plates are HUGE. Luckily this makes good left overs. Definitely check it out and get the pastor. So good!"}
{"text":"Their entrees lacked flavor that I sampled and had more grease than anticipated. Que lastima!"}
{"text":"I decided to give the sister location a try after having a foul experience at the other one. But unfortunately it is no better. Where the hell are all these good reviews coming from???"}
{"text":"Pretty darned good! #19 Daily Special- carne asada burrito enchilada style plus a beef tamale with rice & beans. Solid hearty dinner combo. Need a beer with this meal! #recommended #goherenow"}
{"text":"Absolutely great Mexican food in large quantities for a nice price. We had the pork pastor which was unbelievable and the Steak quesadilla which was great. I would highly recommend this restaurant for Mexican food fans! Quick service and very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"A true dive..but don't let it fool you! The menu is quite extensive and delicious. I went with the #12 Daily Special. For $6.99 you get 2 mini asada tacos and 2 large fish tacos along with a small drink. SOOO flavorful and very filling! I've got my eye on the asada quesadilla next time...and you better believe there will be a next time! Prices are super reasonable and the ladies running the window are extra friendly."}
{"text":"The greatest food is too-oft found in hole-in-the-walls. This is hands down my favorite Mexican joint in Arizona, which is impressive in that there's a lot of good Mexican food in Arizona. If you're ever in Mesa, definitely make a pit stop here."}
{"text":"As previous reviews have stated it is the most authentic mexican food you can get in az, I've lived in nyc and that still does not compare to the award winning delicious taco trucks that city is famous for!! Highly recomend the lengua super tasty and flavorful, my girlfriend had the carne asado she loved it, she was hopeing to get a margarita but they do not serve alcohol.. that is quite alright, because the food made up for it and we ended up going down the street for drinks. This is a great place to have some authentic mexican food!"}
{"text":"What large, filling burritos. The salsas were tasty and the cucumbers/pickles were also tasty. Good horchata. Prices were really cheap. The tortilla seemed a little oily rather than just steamed."}
{"text":"Real Authentic mexican food!!!! The staff and food are amazing. We live in Queen creek and don't mind the long driving because is worth it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos are good here and definitely worth trying.
The chile relleno burrito is the best I've had from any mexican fast food joint I've been to; filiberto's, aliberto's, losbetos (tucson), nico's (tucson)"}
{"text":"As a native Texan, and a resident of Chile country in Colorado, I am always on the hunt for good Mexican food.  As a jalisco style fan, I stopped at this gem in Mesa to the east of Phoenix.  I ordered the number 32 green burro with chicken, and it did not disappoint.  The green sauce had the right amount of heat, and the rice was light and fluffy.  There is a fresh salsa bar, and both the red and green were tasty. I loved the experience as it felt like home in south Texas."}
{"text":"I like going here to eat. Good food small hole in the wall type. You have to order their tacos"}
{"text":"Not your run of the mill taco/burrito shop! I have been here several times and ordered something different each time. Everything that I have had has been great. Their small salsa bar has some tasty salsas, the plate portions are more than you really should eat really but it seems to just disappear from off of my plate. My only problem with this place is that there isn't one closer to my house."}
{"text":"Great food, prepared quickly and served hot!  The combo #9 was delicious!  I will definitely be heading back in the next few weeks."}
{"text":"This is by far, my favorite mexican food place. The chips are sooo good. and everything else is good. The workers are really nice too. 

and they have sangria ! :)"}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican restaurant.  I have been to the other Taquitos Jalisco many times on Gilbert road, I like that place a lot, but this is even better.  The food is fresh and delicious... The salsa you get with the chips and salsa is probably the best I have ever had.  Can't say enough good things about this restaurant."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time today, I had some carne asada and carnitas tacos.  They were probably the best tacos I've ever had.  The rice and beans on the side were also really good.  Cheap prices and great friendly service.  I have a feeling I will become a regular at this place!  Can't wait to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"My family has eaten here several times, you can't beat the prices! The quality of food is great too. I recommend the fish tacos combo daily special. The daily specials have great portions."}
{"text":"I looooove this place. They have the best tacos. I come here every time I come to town."}
{"text":"I really wanted to know what the hype was with the tacos, honestly it was not all that great tasted like any basic taco you'll make at home... also the service was eh kind of like when you walk into McDonald's."}
{"text":"Great food for the price. Always fresh and delicious. I've gotten rolled tacos and breakfast burritos and tamales and other stuff and everything is yummy. The salsa bar is fresh and gas cucumbers and carrots. Service is nice. They bring you your food if you fine in. It gets pretty busy for lunch but they just added an extra counter. They even have french fries that my little Bruce just loved and made her so happy! And she loved the cute red hi chairs and the Mexican man statue greeting you at the front where you order. They have a big selection. Great location."}
{"text":"Visited after reading all of the great reviews. The restaurant and bathroom were dirty but I chose to look past this as I had high hopes for good authentic Mexican food. I was unimpressed! Just mediocre food in an unclean atmosphere."}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if I can. Their fish tacos tasted like sausage for some odd reason. Lady in front older lady made a face while hearing me tell the other employee. Their chips were stale. And it was hot in here. All in all a bad place to visit will not be coming here no more. 1st and last time I come."}
{"text":"The service is friendly and you will have some of the best and authentic Mexican food there is to be had. I'm from San Diego where \"Mexican\" restaurants and food are aplenty. This little spot is as good as the best of them if not better."}
{"text":"I have been going to Taquitos Jalisco for several years. I have introduced my friends and family to them and we all love it. All I can suggest is that you bring a wheel chair with you to the restaurant because they spare no expense on the portions! You may need to be wheeled out to your car..."}
{"text":"Best mexican fast food in the Mesa area that I've found so far.  I personally find their crunchy tacos are more well seasoned then their traditional soft tacos. Which is a little weird; but I imagine, they're more popular anyways.  They have the best fast food enchiladas I've ever tasted hands down! 

I also have had the chile relleno which was a little too coated.  I think there was more batter than chile relleno and they didn't deseed the chile so it was mega hot; but still tasty. Also had the beef sope, which was good, but I found out I'm not a huge fan of lots of masa.  Their pastor tacos were a little dry and not completely trimmed of fat, so watch out.. Similar situation with their steak and chicken soft tacos--dry meat. But for $1 a taco, you can't really complain.  The soft tacos are the size of street tacos but loaded with meat.  The crunchy are your normal size and are a little more expensive.  Their rice is pretty exceptional since it has chunks of carrot in it and their refried beans are not that bad either.  For some odd reason, when we've had leftovers, they're better the second day.  I'm guessing it's because it was fresh when we got it.

They've got a drive thru which is pretty nifty.  We did eat in one time but I ended up being the only female there and was pretty uncomfortable until some other gals walked in.  The neighborhood's a little rough but it still could be worth going in for their salsa bar which includes an avocado salsa and limes--they have to go containers for their salsa bar."}
{"text":"I love this place, being as close as I am to my delightful culture cuisine.. I must say this place is very clean, affordable and it is way much better than most \"fast food\" venues.  Although they don't have a drive thru and the location I don't care much for , the food is great!  Love the green chicken enchiladas, tacos de lengua, pozole or birria... it is great! *** The owner is always around and he is so friendly. I don't care for their traditional mexican beverages there but boy, next door they are good.."}
{"text":"I moved to east Mesa a year ago from Woodland Ca. Out there almost every corner has a Taco truck that had great tacos for $1 a piece. I had searched in vain for a place out here that sold authentic 'street tacos'. Back in May I was getting the windows in my car tinted at a place across the street and saw the sign.I asked the guy doing the windows if they were good,he said \"Yeah,pretty good\" So I came across the street and walked into heaven. As authentic as you can get. The kind of food that is real Mexican. I come here at least 3-4 times a month for lunch,and always leave a happy man."}
{"text":"Food was OK, service was not.  The girl at the counter was very uptight, cold and rude.  She sounded like she didn't want to be there.  How can somebody like that work at a restaurant, much less at the counter."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've dined in, bought to-go & through drive-thru. The girls are great and friendly taking the orders.
Everything I've had is delicious: quesadilla, torta (carne asada), chilaquiles, nachos, menudo, chile relleno... writing this review is making want to Taquitos Jalisco right now."}
{"text":"Places like this are USUALLY a dime a dozen in Mesa, not this place. Best authentic Mexican food around, no joke! If you don't like it, I'll buy your meal!"}
{"text":"This place I call the hole in the wall.  This is authentic Mexican food and the only one that makes Pozole.  I prefer to go during the week and on Sunday, Customer Service is better on those days."}
{"text":"I go here maybe twice a month and finally had time to write a short review.  Prices are very reasonable and the menu is pretty extensive.  I have tried probably everything and never had anything bad.  Everything is fast and fresh.  The dining area is pretty small however I never had an issue getting a table.  They are very nice everytime I visit.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time. I had the #18, which was a chili re' a beef tamale (choice of beef or chicken) and a cheese enchilada served with small salad and great red sauce. The food was great!  Price was about 8$. They also have a really good salsa bar with about five tasty salsas. Yum!  All good. I really liked the tomatillo and the avocado cream sauces, but all three red sauces were Dynamite!  My only delta was that we were there around 10:00AM and the music was a little loud. I liked the music, but just a little softer in the AM. That said, after we got our food (quick service, BTW), someone turned down the music to a good level.  The 4 other people who were in our party were all equally happy.  All in all, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I both had the #1 (1 chicken and 2 carne asada tacos) to go and it was delish! Tacos were filled to the brim with meat and the rice and beans had great flavor. Definitely going back in the very near future!"}
{"text":"I was in the area getting some work on my car so to burn up some time I decided to pop in and have a bite. From the outside I wasn't sure what I was getting into. Once inside it had a nice eating area but what really surprised me was the food. The food was delicious and of generous portions. It was a good experience and a hidden secret I would bring friends to of passing by."}
{"text":"This is a little tacos shop that has amazing tacos and more. I have yet to eat something here that I haven't liked! Their ceviche is amazing and one ceviche tostada to-go is enough to almost make three of them, so the portions are huge. Definitely a must try if your in the mood for some good Mexican food!!"}
{"text":"Place looks like a hole from the outside, but the inside has great, friendly staff, and fantastic food!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! This place has phenomenal  tortillas, very authentic!! We came late at night and asked for breakfast the lady said sorry we only do it in the morning and then immediately came back on the speaker and told us the cooks would do it for us! We asked a lot about what was in what on the menu and they were very helpful! Also great prices can't beat dinner for 2 for less than $15!! Definitely will be back and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I had Taquitos Jalisco cater for a company lunch and the food and preparation of all the sides including tortillas, salsa, onions and cilantro were perfect. The food was delicious. We had carne asada and al pastor and the flavor was on point. The beans tasted amazing and worked well on the side. I highly recommend visiting this place and the staff makes the experience just that much better. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here after searching for cheap Mexican food on Yelp. The place looks like a dive on the outside, in a strip mall next to a 7-11. We ordered ceviche, grilled steak taco, shrimp taco (off menu), grilled steak burrito, and chips and guacamole, all for less than $14. The ceviche was excellent! The girl behind the counter said to ask for it on the side instead of on top of the tostada and you get more. The portion was generous for the price ($3.50), and very tasty. The tacos are very small but also tasty. The burrito we took home for our daughter and her friend to share. They both said it was very good as well and the size generous. The only disappointment was the chips and guacamole. The chips were thicker and harder than we like, and the guacamole, although fresh, was blended to a very smooth consistency, not a single chunk in sight, and was somewhat bland. Adding the juice of a lime segment (several of which are included with each meal) and salt fixed the flavor. This place was a pleasant surprise and I'll definitely be back for the ceviche, if nothing else. Thanks for the recommendation, Yelpers!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! So much that I'm writing my first review on yelp ever...coming from California it was hard to find a good Mexican food place out here...they are small but have so much to choose from...the girls that work there are friendly and quick...me and my fiancée had gone in to get my favorite pregnancy craving but were 1.50 short, instead of making us take something off the girl said \"that's okay it's only food\" and let us have it anyways...I go to this place a lot and will continue going there for forever..."}
{"text":"foods been good times I've been there my family usually love ordering the special which is one taco two rolled tacos and bean and cheese tostada for about 3.99 I would give this stars but just went here day before yesterday and they forgot to give me my drink there was no one else there so they were not busy I was in a hurry left got home and realized they didn't give me my drink"}
{"text":"I drive by this place everyday and finally decided to stop. Never noticed it has a drive through. Ordered the Carne Asada, took it home, and it was delicious. Wasn't able to eat it all, there was so much. Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Really not sure why this restaurant does not have 5 stars because it is the absolute best, hands down! This is my second time eating here in one week. I crave this place. If you like it hot, the Deviled Shrimp is to die for. The Ranchero Steak plate is also delicious, so delicious that my mom just put in another order to go so she can have it for dinner :) The establishment is clean and the staff is super friendly.   I highly recommend Jalisco's!!!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos = Excellent.  I will be going back again this week just for these.  The creamy, spicy sauce was addictive.

Rice and beans = Even these were a cut above.  The refried beans had this smokey note to them that kept me interested.

Flan = Dessert was well crafted and huge.  I could only eat half.  Would have tried the Tres Leches Cakes, but they were sold out.

Service = Very friendly.  Clean restaurant.  Reasonable wait time."}
{"text":"Seriously fresh and delicious. My favorite Mexican food, hands down. I love the taquetos with the quac on top. The beans and rice are incredible. Everything is authentic and I've liked everything that I have tried."}
{"text":"This place is great! The only reason they get 4 stars is because there is only one bathroom shared by all! But if you don't have to use it, okay then 5 STARS!!! The food is authentic down home Mexico fair. The choices in sauces and condiments will get you when you enter. Then the food selection is great and they offer several combination's. Also they have a nice lunch menu where you can get several items and a drink for a fair price too. You will have to ask for it to go because you get so much that you will have leftovers! The tacos are crispy and stuffed with clean fresh lettuce. I got the fish tacos and they were fresh and delish! Also this is a very clean establishment, don't judge it by the outside. If you do you will miss out! And they have a drive thru!!!!"}
{"text":"First time ordering takeout thru Yelp. My wife and I were tired of pizza. This placed had really good reviews so we gave it a shot. The food was on time if not early. The serving size was huge, I couldn't finish my meal. The super nachos were a meal in itself. The carne burrito was excellent. So glad we decided to try this out. Now we have a Mexican connection to add to the delivery list. Thank you for the awesome dinner."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent, and you get a generous serving for the price, but the service could use some work. This is a small neighborhood place and there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason about who gets their order and when (otherwise a 5 star rating would be well deserved). I won't nit-pick about my experience because the food is that good. If I'm in the neighborhood I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Cheap, tasty as hell, what else do you want? The lengua is super tender and delicious."}
{"text":"Discovered this place driving by it on Broadway, just east of Alma School.
Lots of taco shops in the valley, but this one has a few things that simply make it better than the average slew of \"(insert random name here)berto's\" type places.
First off, the tortillas they use to make the burros are delicious, almost as good as Carolina's.  My favorite item is the shrimp burro.  The shrimp are nice/firm, combined with rice and other filling to create an extremely tasty burro!  They offer a Diablo version of the same if you are feeling spicy!
Their breakfast burros are also quite tasty.  Other items I've tried include hard shell tacos, taquitos and these tasty bags of tortilla rounds they either bake or fry and coat with sugar and cinnamon.  Simple, yet delicious!
I have no opinion on the refried beans as I usually don't have them on or with anything I order.
You can dine in (a few tables inside) or go through the drive thru.  I recommend going inside to see all the tasty options on their menu board. (You will find misspellings on the board, but hey, I'm more concerned about the food and service than an absolutely correct translated menu board)
Is the place perfect, no, but what is?! I would agree with one of the other reviewers, that the fish tacos are not the best choice here.  Also, they have been a little slow on preparing orders a couple times, but it's always been worth the wait.
Lastly the place is always very clean and the staff are very nice!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here at least 8 times and always happy. Friendly employees, good food, especially the chili rellenos.  Reasonably priced good quality food. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I was in Mesa for business and had a craving for tacos. The location does not scream delicious as it is a little hole-in-the-wall, but the food is awesome. 

I ordered a couple tacos al pastor and a couple shrimp tacos. The al pastor tacos were pretty good, but the definite standout were the shrimp tacos. The tacos came with a cabbage salad and a creamy sauce that both added greatly to the success of the dish.  The shrimp was succulent and not dry in the least.  After finishing eating, I wish I would have skipped the tacos al pastor and just gotten another shrimp taco 

If you have a craving for Mexican food I highly recommend trying out the restaurant.  I went on a Friday night and it was pretty packed so the food took 10-15 minutes to come out, but it was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Just okay. Because I was the only white person here I had high hopes it was going to be a real winner. Sadly it is just okay, about on par with filibertos or others."}
{"text":"Jose and his family have found a warm spot in my heart for so many reasons.  To mention a few; they serve some of the best Mexican food I have experienced in 45 years, they provide generous servings, their prices are very reasonable and they show a genuine appreciation for your business.  
I have been dining here since moving back to Arizona in 2009 and I just don't feel motivated to go anywhere else.
The Chile Rellenos are outstanding, the refried beans have a distinct and delightful flavor which leads me to believe the recipe involves bacon drippings and the quacamole is head and shoulders above what is being served at other places.  As for the burritos, they are large enough to merit their own zip code.  

Many thanks to Jose and his family for many wonderful meals and friendly service."}
{"text":"What happened to you beans Taquito Jalisco? They taste like water I feel like things have change.. disappointed."}
{"text":"Every good thing you've read about their chicken & spinach enchiladas is on point!  Oh my gosh... tried this place for the first time last night and those enchiladas surpassed my expectations, especially in the flavor department!  I didn't care for their salsa, but only because it was too hot for this wimp.  Chips were yummy.  I went through the drive thru and didn't notice any additional charges that I thought I had read in previous reviews... must have read outdated reviews.  I did have to wait 10-15 minutes after ordering, but I have no problem waiting patiently for fresh food!  Even after the slow drive home, this food was hot, fresh, and delicious.  My boyfriend (who choose the healthier homemade leftovers last night) really liked their green sauce!  Going to return to explore their menu for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is on point they have the best mexican food I've tasted since i lived in mexico the tacos de pastor are so good and so it the ceviche pretty much everything on the menu is worth it :)"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant because of all the good reviews, so I went in with high expectations. I was so disappointed that the food was just ok. The fish taco was dry and lacked flavor. The guacamole on the rolled tacos was tasteless. I also had the carne asada taco which was the best thing I ordered but still nothing to brag about. My husband had the steak and eggs. It looked more like machaca. The dining room was clean but the bathroom was disgusting. I would only revisit this restaurant if it was the only thing open and I was starving."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. I recommend the chicken spinach enchiladas and the mixed tacos."}
{"text":"Yelpers did not let me down at all on this one! AMAZING! Had the fish burrito (huge) and carne asada tacos (2 street tacos per order). Both were extremely fresh and had great flavor. You get a lot of food for the money without any sacrifice to the quality.  

Will definitely be back. Would love it if they opened a location around North Phoenix.

PROS
1. Fresh food
2. Tasty
3. Clean despite the \"hole in the wall\" appearance from the outside
4. Friendly and helpful staff

CONS
None"}
{"text":"Let me cut to the chase, get steak tacos! I also like the #18. (Enchilada, tamale and chile relleno) It's unbelievably delicious. Don't ignore this advice! Do the steak tacos! If you go and order some weird obscure thing, it will probably be good, but the signature item is the STEAK TACOS!!!! Don't let the green sauce scare you, it's good. I like the lighter colored sauce as well. The darker sauce is chipotle which is smoked pepper. It is way over powering and anything smoked must be done in moderation. I never do it.
I can not vouch for any other locations."}
{"text":"We always pick up to go from here whenever we're in the mood for Mexican food.  I pass it everyday to and from work, but have never been in.  First time, hubby got their spinach enchilada special - OMG it was killer good!  To be safe he got the fish tacos and carne asade taco combo.  Everything was delish!  We order take out a couple of times a week from them.  

Everything we've tried have been superb.  Just had dinner here tonight.  YUMMM....  Their salad is a bit spicy, lots of jalapenos"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of al pastor and it's the barometer by which I measure authentic Mexican places. The al postor here is phenomenal and the salsa is great, too. Meats are bursting with flavor and everything is fresh. Can't believe I've lived in Mesa most of my life and hadn't hit this spot until recently. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing value, fantastic food, fish burrito is excellent, jalisco is a winner. I come here alot."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and each time this place is packed to the gills!

The food is pretty decent quality, especially considering it is TOTALLY CHEAP! They have a small patio out front with plastic-y picnic benches, too.

They have a nice salsa bar that always looks clean (before I get to making a mess, that is).

I haven't ordered one, but the burritos are insane and make Chipotle burritos look teeny.  

Free wifi, not that I used it.

Warning: the restroom looks straight out of the ghetto. AVOID!"}
{"text":"Basic good Mexican food. Nothing fancy or gourmet.  Fast friendly and cheap.  Good music"}
{"text":"LOVED this place!!!!  I was curious how good the Mexican food was in AZ. Hands down, all the placed I ate....this was the best!  Great prices also!!"}
{"text":"Seriously fresh mex at a great price. The fish burrito was the best I have had in quite a long time. My wife's chile relleno burrito was succulent. Both burritos featured a homemade tortilla that was grilled and filled. Our seven year old, frequently a picky water, wolfed down his chicken and rice. Such a satisfying meal. And the ladies are all over it with spot-on, friendly service. Well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"The high reviews are accurate. Very nice authentic little place. Extremely clean! Friendly, fast and cheap. Burrito comes with lots of meat and everything we had tasted great. This is our new favorite."}
{"text":"the best in town always get the pastor burrito believe its overpriced for burrito shop but it is good 7 dollor burrito"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Amazing food!!! Strongly recommend! Very friendly staff! The place also has a drive through! I cannot stop saying positive things!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner had a daily special #9 Carne Asada Burrito & 3 roll tacos W/Guacamole & drink for $5.99
Like this little hole in the wall on Broadway Street. Was very clean inside the people who work here are very friendly and very helpful with the menu. The place was very nice and chilly must've had the AC down to around 64° Yes I would come back and order again trying different combinations on the menu."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good spot to eat street tacos since I moved to AZ from the bay area, and I've found it. I ordered the 2 carne asada & 2 fish tacos. That sh*t was bomb. The sauce on the fish tacos was killin.  I'm differently coming back."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE this place. Great food, prices and service is always excellent!
This is Mesa BEST Mexican restaurant. Located in Broadway and Alma School. Customer service is excellent, the girls are always happy to serve even when the place is packed! They are quick and efficient! Food is always freshly made by order and it tastes delicious. Plates are huge and the prices are excellent. Cooks are amazing! Place is small, have great music playing. Definitely will keep going there. My husband is very meticulous when it comes to Mexican food and he says this is the closest to his city food. It's really delicious! Overall the best restaurant in Arizona. What are you waiting for? Come and try this place!"}
{"text":"This place is a classic. It's been unchanged for years. Every once in a while they will reprint it but it looks almost the same as it did 10 years ago. 


Awesome burritos. Amazing carne asada tacos. Chips are usually good. Really nice employees."}
{"text":"My first time came here because of what i read on Yelp! first thing I noticed lots there were lots of local Mexicanos eating here..GOOD sign! Very friendly staff!  I noticed they do not automatically serve Tortilla Chips & Salsa...had to order it separately the salsa bar was clean, well stocked & tasted exceptional! I noticed a lady coming every 5 to 10 mins to replenish & clean the salsa bar! Excellent service! Highly recommend this \"hole in the wall\""}
{"text":"Taquitos Jalisco is as authentic of Mexican food as you can get, and the prices are reminiscent of the penny horse at the grocery store. 

The most initial impression of Taquitos Jalisco may be misleading, nestled between a 7/11 and bordering a Little Caesar's pizza and a phone store (as well as a Mexican bakery which is also delicious). As you enter the tiny restaurant, there is seating for approximately 20, an outdated interior and an even more outdated jukebox. The counter setting resembles a Chinese takeout. 

As you begin to browse the menu, you come to realize that this is not your average quote authentic Mexican restaurant. This is the real deal. The tongue, the menudo, both extremely common in Mexico and both extremely uncommon in America. I have ordered many items from the menu and can safely say that I have not had a bad experience yet. If you are truly interested in authentic Mexican food and less interested in American influenced Mexican food, I would recommend that you give Taquitos Jalisco the ol' college try. I can promise that you will find what you have been looking for this whole time in this huge city; delicious, cheap, fresh and authentic Mexican food.

Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"Made the drive from Fountain Hills because we are still desperate to find a to go to Mexican place. Came here on a Sunday afternoon last week after 3PM and it was crowded. It's a small location and every table was taken and there was a line of about 4-5 people crowding the front of the restaurant at any given time.

When it was our turn to order, we had a girl cashier take our order. We had a couple questions about the menu and she answered them curtly with no enthusiasm or sign of friendliness. We were going to order 2 orders of the #31 the shredded beef and taco rice and beans plate but at the last minute I saw the $7.99 daily special was of better value and decided to change my mind. This way I would be able to taste a little bit of everything, an enchilada, Chile relleno and the shredded beef taco.

I noticed that there was going to be price difference and asked her to change what she was about to charge me. The cashier punched some numbers in a calculator and then pretended to make changes in what she was ringing up. Thinking she made the adjustment I didn't look at my receipt. The cashier handed me my card and receipt and we sat down waiting for our food to be delivered.

A couple things then happened:

1) My changed order didn't reflect a price difference on my receipt. Not only did she charge me the original full price for the first order she rung up but she gave me the wrong size drink. The smaller size drink. Btw, there are no refills included at this place.

2) When our food was delivered, my husband's taco plate was warm but the 2/3 tacos were cold.

3) All the food on my 3 item plate was lukewarm and drenched in oil.

4) The Chile relleno had the thickest batter on it and when I forked it, it was cold in the middle. I took apart the batter from the Chile and just ate the Chile. 

5) The enchilada was lukewarm and was way too salty.

6) As far as the shredded beef taco, the meat was nicely seasoned and was decent tasting.

7) At the end of the meal, I went to the only bathroom in the restaurant and found it to be a unisex bathroom. The bathroom did not meet my cleanliness meter as it had a damp unknown smell and toilet paper strewn on the floor. I walked in and walked right out.

Not sure if we came on an off day but thus so far was our experience and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very very good food, had the # 11 Combo with Cheese Enchillada, Chili Rellenos and Beef Tamale and it was wonderful and tastly. Not too much spice but enough to give it some kick."}
{"text":"The daily specials are great. A lot of food for a low price. I had 3 taco rolls w/guacamole, a carne burrito, and some  horchata $7-8 with tax. Friendly staff on top of all that too."}
{"text":"Tacos here were really good. I tried the pastor and the lengua and was very happy. Will definitely eat here again when I'm in the east mesa area."}
{"text":"The tacos are amazing! Especially the pastor.  And OMG they have limes-- civilization is alive in the Valley of the Sun! They have burritos, quesadillas, and enchiladas, which I'm sure are just as good, but I always end up with the tacos.  They're just too good to pass up.  Prices are reasonable, except the $1.50 they want for a refill on drinks (what?!).  Don't get any hot peppers on your food!
 The place is small, so if you've got a bunch of people you might have to split up at different tables, there are only two and four-seaters.  It seems to be pretty clean, even the onesie bathroom isn't super gross.  My only concern is the sketchy neighborhood.  Its not the sketchiest place I've ever eaten tacos (that honor goes to Friendly's gas station tacos in Dallas, Tx!), but let's just say I wouldn't be comfortable stopping here after sunset.  The bar next door looks like they plucked it straight up out of a Mexico City barrio-- some scary stuff going on in there, I'm sure of it.  Like they need a concertina fence around the parking lot, seriously.  Daytime is the time to come here, enjoy your tacos, and get the hell out.  Situational awareness should be stressed, however, even in the sunshine!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try simply based on the reviews.  I was not disappointed.  The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was clean.  Ordered 2 shredded beef tacos minus the lettuce.  The tacos arrived and I could immediately tell they were going to be good.  They are a little larger than your average fried taco and full of beef cheese and pico.  They are as good as any I've had and I strongly recommend this restaurant.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Possibly the best Mexican food in the valley! I never would have thought to go there just from driving by but my husband was taken there by a friend and in turn took me there. It is now a favorite and regular spot for us. I have not had anything yet that was not completely delicious!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth ordering if you want the standard tasty Mexican American food and the portions are big enough to satisfy with leftovers for the next day if you want!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best quality/ bang for your buck place to eat Mexican food. Ive been going her for 10 years now and have yet to be disappointed by the food or staff. Get the carne asada taco and any kind of burro. Anything you will try will be good."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Arizona the past couple years and this is my first time stepping out of Phoenix and Tucson into Mesa Arizona I have to say the best food in Arizona is in Mesa this place has some of the best Mexican food in Arizona Green chili was delicious the tongue  burrito was outstanding and the tamale oh the tamale soft and delicious. Great job"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for the weekend and stopped here for late lunch looking for authentic Mexican food-look no further! Spotless facilities, food was home made and completely delicious. It was fresh right down to the shredded lettuce. You won't be disappointed! Very kind employees greeted us with a smile-thank you!"}
{"text":"You ever gotten indigestion from eating bad Mexican food?! Filibertos perhaps? This is not that place. Great food."}
{"text":"3 shrimp tacos that will blow your mind. It's like I'm back at Abu's house in Xalapa!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this restaurant earned 4.5 stars. When we first walked in, it felt like we were in a sauna. The food was not fresh as they advertised on their front glass window. The food appeared and tasted like it was cooked earlier today and was kept warmed until served. We ordered the carne asada torta, grilled shrimp plate and the chicken quesadilla combo. The lady at the counter had stated the torta had guacamole and it didn't. The grilled shrimp were not deveined and were overcooked to the point you can barely peel the skin off. Also, we asked for the chicken to be on the side, not inside of the quesadilla and the chicken appeared grey and reheated. The only reason I giving them one star is because the horchata was good. I will not be dining in this restaurant again unless they serve fresh food as they say they do."}
{"text":"This place is legit. It is NOT a Filibertos or anything like it. While I'm ok with those joints, this place is two notches higher.. Great fish tacos. Great carne asada. Beans are good and authentic. Salsa is good, but could use one with more heat. Service is very good. Place is clean and a good ambiance for a hole I. The wall taco shop. Bottom line, one of the best authentic joints around!!!"}
{"text":"im banning this place for good! never going back!

food is great except i couldn't get any this morning. what a joke! they're supposed to open at 8:00. the lady sees me and other people outside waiting and won't open the door. she finally opens the door at 8:09 and then when i go to order she says they aren't even ready yet. it will be another 10-15 minutes. she was grouchy, no smile, not welcoming, etc. i even said hi and good morning and she didn't even respond. i've watched at least seven people come and leave because they're not prepared and not friendly. really disappointing!! people are just walking out. not a way to run a business at all. good food will carry you only so far. if you don't take care of your customers and your service sucks. sayonara. adios. hasta la vista!!!

i cant believe it. i finished posting my comment in my truck outside the restaurant. its now 12 minutes later so i decide i'll go back in. the lady sees me (im their only potential customer at this point) and she shakes her head with a scowl that im even back in the restaurant. are you kidding me. i pay your bills lady and youre acting like im inconveniencing you! never coming back and texting all of my friends who eat there to do the same. theres a friggin' taco shop every 500 feet in mesa. unbelievable!!!!!"}
{"text":"Diablo shrimp kicked my ass and made me beg for more at the same time!!! Amazing!!! But not for the weak, or sensitive! My new fav spot & the staff is professional & courteous."}
{"text":"The best Mexican good in Mesa !! Nice clean place amazing good !! Thanks yelp for guiding me there !"}
{"text":"This place is a winner, nice people, great food and value.  You can eat like a king in here for under $10.  I often judge a place on how I feel physically after I've eaten there.  Felt pretty darn good after eating here today.  Incredible value, had two fish tacos, two carne asada tacos and a 16oz drink for $9.50 out the door.  The smokey chipotle sauce they put on the fish tacos is great.  The Avocado salsa and all other salsa's are very good.  They don't skimp at all, they give you nice fat tacos.  Always busy in a tiny place which was once a taco bell must be doing something right."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are bomb!!! So much fish, it was falling out the end! A very small place but lots of seating. The only thing I didn't care for was the music was a little loud. Selfish! May just have to swing by and get some tacos now!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 10 years!  Great authentic Mexican food for a very reasonable price!  Go try it!"}
{"text":"This place has the best food ever, really really good rice and beans and that's how you know!!, shrimp tacos are the shit!! Fish taco's are good but I had better and everything else is awesome , I like the taquitos and how they serve them and the mix tacos that have Asada & pastor mix. Everything else is great and don't forget their deserts the tres leches cake is to die for and their flan is right up there too... Two thumbs up!!!!:-)"}
{"text":"This was sooooooo good!!!! i searched for cheap lunches and was lucky that this came up. i got 2 grilled steak tacos and a shrimp taco and my total was 5.49. They were delicious too. I love the sauce here the red is good with a little spice but the green YUMMY!!! i love spicy food so it was perfect. my mouth has the perfect burn going on right now. i will definitely be eating here again! i am super lucky that i work about a mile away too!!! i would definitely recommend it to friends in fact i have already to two of them!"}
{"text":"Delicious carne asada and bean burritos. Not on my side of town but I was over there on business and had a really nice dinner."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the area! The Carnitas tacos are amazing! The taquitos aren't super greasy! And the fish taco was awesome!! Def my go to Mexican place!"}
{"text":"Great food, and great value. A hearty Carne Asada burro plus 3 rolled tacos and a drunk for under 7 bucks? Yuuuuup.  Good food, short wait times, good salsa bar. This place is one of those \"hole in the wall\" joints that you'd never even notice if somebody didn't point it out to you."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican food place I've had in Arizona!  The portions are huge and the price is really cheap. They're rice and beans are on point!"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome and very fairly priced. For breakfast, you cannot pass up chorizo burrito. And for lunch or dinner there are so many great combinations I can never decide which is my favorite. Highly recommend this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this, FOOD WILL BLOW YOUR MIND.

This spot has an amazing taste and I can confidently say, it doesn't get any closer from legit Mexican food. 

In my opinion, this spot is one of the best for Mexican Food around the valley.

I have visited way too many times this place, and tried almost all their menu.

They do have an amazing variety of dishes for a very affordable price.

Staff and chef are super friendly.

Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Looks super sketchy from outside, inside it's a whole different world. It's very, very clean inside, employees make you feel like you're at home visiting your family and the food is damn good. My plate looked like something that came from a nice sit down place and tasted amazing. I can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Went with a large group from work. Excellent food. Low cost. I think everyone enjoyed their food. Only complaint I would have was that the carrot and jalapeno mix at the condiment bar was not very spicy at all. Would go back for lunch again."}
{"text":"Tacos,  burritos and enchiladas were all really good!!! Service was quick and food was good and hot!!!! Carnitas was my favorite!"}
{"text":"Ok... So I just finished tacos from Jalisco for the umpteenth time and here's the thing... If I was on death row ( which I hope doesn't happen anytime soon...) 2 fish tacos and 2 carnitas tacos plus a bunch of other stuff I didn't order cuz ok... I'm NOT on death row... Would b my last meal!!! Must I say it again?!? If u haven't been here yet... What the HELL is wrong w/ u?????"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. I came down to visit from California my mom lives here in Mesa so I took her out to lunch and she suggested this place. The food was excellent the beans are perfect the rice was nice and Flaky and I love that they were not selfish with guacamole and sour cream on my taquitos. The service was great also. It's a small place but it's got that nice homie feeling."}
{"text":"This place has the best fish tacos in Mesa! The prices are pretty good too. I also tried the spinach enchilada which was also really good. It is much cleaner than Filibertos and they are pretty nice and Accommodating. They hand scoop their Orchatta which I'm pretty sure they make daily by hand. It was delicious."}
{"text":"WOOHOO!!! Wife and I LOVE this place!!! I'm hesitant to write such a stellar review, as I don't want more people showing up and making wait times too long....but damn this place ROCKS!!! Their tacos are to dies for, and the carnitas is fantastic!!! We used to go to Cafe Rio all the time, not any more!!!! How many more !!!! can I use? The burritos are great, the enchiladas, YUM!!! We'll frequent this establishment many more times!!!"}
{"text":"We came here during a late night food run. My friend and I ordered two tacos each. The tacos were very flavorful and on very fresh tortillas. The salsa nicely complimented the meat. 

We went through the drive thru which was relatively slow. It looked like the food was made when ordered. Overall the food was good. Would go back again in the future. It was a very solid mexican fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places for street tacos and burritos!  The staff is friendly and the food comes out quickly. Although some of their staff don't speak English very well, its worth fumbling through the language barrier for their food!"}
{"text":"I dine out often and rarely rate a restaurant with 5 stars.  The food here is the better than any other Mexican restaurant I have been to.  The chile rellenos were delicious, as was the chile verde.  Service is great, the restaurant is clean, and there is drive-up service as well.  The restaurant is small, so it is best to avoid peak hours."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food you will find in the valley! Closest thing you will get to real food from mexico. You have to try the bean and cheese burro and the pastor tacos. Those are my go to. Excellent service too! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food! Stopped by for lunch. Nice little location. Kept clean. Ordered a Carnitas Torta and a taco al pastor. Torta was really good. Carnitas had a good taste and texture to them. Tacos was also very good. Probably one of the better taco al pastor that I've had in the valley. And the horchata taste like it was home made. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place. There were a few misunderstandings when ordering but they took care of it. Chicken tacos have a good flavor and there is a little salsa/condiment bar. Decor is a little dirty, but not as bad as some places I've seen. All in all, I do recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"bomba**food!@!! and great service. The food was really tasty and the drinks were a 4/5. We got our food really fast."}
{"text":"Wow!!! The Mexican food here is just too awesome!!!! Seriously flavorful and the price is just right! I am really impressed! We ordered chips & salsa, veggie burrito, shrimp burrito, and a seafood soup (for less than $30). And like other reviewers have mentioned, there's a salsa bar that has quite a few different options--all a delicious addition to our burritos! I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Some of the BEST Mexican Food in the Valley and close to work. Reminds me of what I get when I am in San Diego. Been eating here at least twice a week for the last year and it is always tasty. They have take out, drive through, indoor and outdoor seating if you want. Always very clean inside and out. Family owned and run. They take great pride in delivering fantastic fresh favors with large portions for an affordable price. They have several combo plates with rice and beans on the menu or you can just order a la cart which I prefer. Tacos, Burritos, Tortas, Cheese Crisp, Nachos, Fish and Shrimp dishes, Authentic Soups, Soda Pops, and Deserts. Too many items to list them all here. Some of my favorites would be the fish tacos, shrimp tacos, chile rellenos, carnitas, carne asada, fajitas, al pastor, breakfast burritos of all sorts. They are very friendly and will make what ever you want pretty much. Great Salsa Bar also with fresh hot carrots and jalapenos, cucumbers, limes / lemons, and 4 different salsas. Simplemente fantástico!"}
{"text":"Quick and delicious. Got the steak and pastor tacos and added salsa verde for a kick! Would definitely come back to try their other options."}
{"text":"Some of the worst mexican food I've had out in arizona burrito was super greasy! There was hair in my food and the employees were rude. Overall don't recommend this place..."}
{"text":"This place is pricey and doesn't take vegetarians into consideration. I ordered a number 11 (3 Green cheese enchiladas with rice and beans on the side) and asked if I could get something instead of the lard filled beans and was told no by who seemed to be the manager. I asked another lady the same thing and she seemed unsure on what to do but at least that lady later came back with a couple of options such as another side or rice or a salad. Normally either one of those options would be fine but the rice was not a solution since it was obviously cooked with chicken broth and the salad didn't sound too good with the whole lettuce scare going on with ecoli. I wish they had another option like another enchilada or some money off but they didnt seem to want to make me happy and just left it at that. So take this 1 star review for what it is, just my unique experience as a vegetarian. What's with all these restaurants that don't know what customer service is? Crazy. $10 for 3 cheese enchiladas with 2 sides that I cant eat? No thanks. To make matters worse I used the bathroom on my way out and got burned by the hottest hot water ever in any bathroom I have ever been to. I mean this was past boiling point. It seems like they mickey moused the plumbing and aren't even controlling how hot the water gets. You have to turn the cold water on all the way just to make the hot water somewhat bareable. They're going to get a bunch of people burned and I'm sure they don't care cause customer service isn't their thing. I got burned and I'm madder than I was when it was just the 2 sides I can't eat issue. Horrible experience. Never coming again. I hope this place gets shut down. I'll look into who I can report the hot water problem to."}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem. It's a semi spotty area surrounded by some industrial buildings but inside is clean. 

The food is AMAZING and the staff is always really friendly and fast. The carnitas tacos are unreal - the meat is crispy and charred on the edges and they put a very generous amount of meat in their tacos. The prices are super fair especially considering the quality and amount of food they give you.

There's a drive-thru as well, but I prefer to go inside and utilize the fresh salsa bar."}
{"text":"It's not everyday that the food looks better in person than it does in the picture. The staff was super friendly and attentive and the food was incredible. This place is a hidden gem and I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"THE BOMB!!! Had the Super Nachos Carne Pollo...OMG!!!! Nachos were super fresh and chicken was delicious!! Guac and beans were perfect!!! I live 20 minutes East, but will make the drive at least once a week from now on!!!"}
{"text":"Apparently not being fluent in spanish is a problem for these people. When i asked if they sold posole i was hung up on. Rude. N seriously the health department should probably be called. I didn't know asking if they sold a product that i wanted would be an issue. Im sorry im white i guess. Rude people shouldn't be working in customer service."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable!  It's difficult to find restaurants that make good Spanish rice! We'll come back!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican food places in Mesa that you could almost miss if you weren't looking. The food is unbelievably good. I'm sometimes wearing about fish in quick serve restaurants but their fish burrito is one of my favorite around. Also all their salsas from the salsa bar are great. Will most definitely be back next time I'm in Mesa"}
{"text":"When Rand H. told me that our lunch group was having a UYE here, I looked up the yelp reviews for the place and decided that I *must* go. And I'm glad I did! I had the fish, chicken, and carnitas tacos - all really good, especially the carnitas where the pork was slightly crispy, the way I like it. I also ordered a chile relleno and it was the best I've ever had - so flavorful and tasty that I easily finished it even though I already felt full after eating the tacos. This place is quite a distance from where I live but I definitely wouldn't mind coming here again and again; it's certainly worth the drive."}
{"text":"Food is awesome for a great price. Carnitas were crunchy, spinach and cheese enchiladas, rice and beans flavorful. Restroom needs a re-do but, customer service was friendly and quick to serve. Overall great place and we're definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Had a pork green chili burrito with a side of rice. It was good, about 7 out of 10. Lots of meat. Short on green chili. The rice was great. The prices are reasonable but not the same as those posted in pictures on this page. They are old posts. Burritos are between $6 and 7 dollars. Enchilada style is $2. Side of rice and beans is $2.49. the green chili is made with chili verde and not tomotillos, which is good."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and thought it was a good idea if I was in the area. Very dis-appointed. The carne asada was round steak, not skirt,  that was fried, not grilled. It was a little pricey, for what they delivered. I ordered a Carne burrito enchilada style with rice and beans. $7.95. Meat had only the flavor of salt, beans were flat and gritty, not smooth and flavorful. Rice had the right color but not very flavorful either. 16 oz drink was $1.99. .50 cent refills. Only two choices for salsa, red, or green, in warm squeeze bottles on the table.  Wasn't very clean, and some tables weren't bussed. I guess the 5 star reviews were either planted, or they don't know dick about Mexican food. John S. thought Cafe Rio was the bomb, so that makes sense. Hey, if you dying and need food, this would do, but not going out of my way.  Truthfully? It ranks about the same as Filiberto's.  But Fili's is cheaper, and more common. But Filiberto's has a salsa bar."}
{"text":"This is an unassuming hole in the wall Mexican restaurant which I know are a dime a dozen around here but this absolutely has to be one of the better options out there. I can highly recommend both the fish and shrimp tacos as they were delicious! It's hard to even pick a favorite out of the two but I did prefer the fish taco just slightly more in my opinion. I would love to try their combo plates here next time. The people working here are really nice as well and it's awesome to see that there's a drive-thru option.

Out of the many options for Mexican food I'm glad that I tried this one. I'll be back again surely if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place is a total hole in the wall, but it is hands down the best Mexican food I've ever had, and I've tried a lot of different places. I love the fish taco combo plate the best, but the fish burrito is also great. Other awesome choices are the rolled tacos, pastor tacos, cheese enchiladas and steak quesadilla. Everything is wonderful!"}
{"text":"The delivery was pretty quick but the food wasn't that good.
The chili Relleno was way under cooked, and I asked for no onions, and there was onions.
I've had better. Way better"}
{"text":"Always good quality.  Always friendly service.  Love this place and the giant burritos!!!  Come here for the best mexican food in Winter Garden."}
{"text":"Went to Tacos Jaliscos today and ordered Pozole. Was told they were out of it. So I ordered the tacos at $1 each. I ordered 2 de pastor and 2 of lengua. I must say that they were not fresh at all and they did have a TON of cilantro and onion mix on there. I really didn't like the tacos. Now, the drink place next door is really good. Probably won't return unless I try the Pozole."}
{"text":"We went here because of all of the wonderful reviews and I don't like giving bad reviews but I feel like I had to with this place because it just wasn't very good for multiple reasons. First when we were ordering the woman taking our order was watching the football game on the TV and barely paid attention to us. Second the food was underwhelming, we ordered the steak burrito which was literally just steak and the California burrito that had almost no meat and was mostly potatoes, nothing had cheese even though we asked for it and they were also out of guacamole and sour cream. Lastly there were people sweeping the entire time we were there and kept sweeping over our feet and acting like we weren't sitting there eating. $25 for 2 boring burritos and bad service is just way too much."}
{"text":"Really delicious and inexpensive mexican food.  Great staff who love the food and know how to describe it. Our favorites include tamales, fish tacos, cevich toastadas, shrimp quesadillas and steak tacos. Excellent salsas and sauces. Has a popular drive-thru and catering too. The best mexican food we have had in the east valley."}
{"text":"Price. Taste. Customer service all amazing. Everything is freshly made from scratch except for drinks. Best Mexican food around."}
{"text":"Great food!! Shady location. However that didn't stop people from filling up the place. This place has one of the best chimichangas I've had. There are many items on the menu that I want to try so I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I go here about two times a week to get their carnitas burrito and it is always great. The building looks like another Filiberto's knock-off, but trust me, this family run restaurant is in a whole other league. The employees are all very accommodating to modifying item's. Due to dietary restriction I will often request many changes to items and they comply with no question. If you are looking for some quick Mexican food I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I ate here on a weekly basis when I lived nearby and I still look for any excuse to go to Mesa just so I can hit up the drive-thru. Their fish tacos are the best I've ever had and anything else I've ever ordered has been nothing less than delicious. 

They're very decently priced and the ladies who take the orders and work the registers are super nice and friendly. The service is also pretty quick. 

They also have a fresh salsa bar inside! If you live in Mesa and haven't tried this place, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. Serve piping hot, real chili, fast service. Tables were clean, only issue is, music was really, really loud. Otherwise five stars"}
{"text":"I work very close to this restaurant and eat here often. The staff is awesome have my order memorized. There carne asada is very good! I love spicy food and they throw in a roasted jalapeño. I usually take out but if your eating here must try their burritos wet, both red and green sauces are very good."}
{"text":"Very good! Go get the chicken tacos or the steak burrito! Oh and the taquitos are great too!"}
{"text":"First time. Burnt meat on 5 tacos and a burrito. Bad red sauce and the tortillas were dried and burnt.
Not going back"}
{"text":"The reviews tell the truth - excellent fresh food with great flavor served by friendly smiling faces!   Not much more to say besides \"we'll be back!\""}
{"text":"Many of the reviews for Taquitos Jalisco were really misleading. We were pretty excited to eat here but sadly won't go back. As a few people have mentioned, the salsa was watery and doesn't stay on the chips. It's salsa water containing not just leaves of cilantro, but stems too. It just didn't make sense. We also tried the other salsa mentioned with grilled veggies but that wasn't good either. Nothing seemed fresh, it just tasted like it was sitting around for days. (Marination is of course not a bad thing, but..)

My husband got chicken enchiladas with rice and beans - the plate just looked, well, gross and the presentation was not appetizing. Everything tasted bland. My Guadalajara Plate was much better than his food but still was not the amazing homemade Mexican food we were hoping for. The soft beef taco did have a real homemade tortilla but it was cracked and soggy too, so I couldn't pick it up. The chicken enchilada was the best part and looked better than the kind my husband got for some reason. And my chile relleno was flavorful but overall was just a mushy mess that I couldn't find the desire to finish.

There are much better places to get Mexican food in Central Florida. The food was not terrible, but it's not our cup of mole."}
{"text":"Best Cabeza taco I have ever had!!! I am here with three of my Mexican friends and they also approve! It is truly authentic!"}
{"text":"I've dined in here and gone through the drive thru window. You have to time it right if you want a table because it does get busy for lunch. Each time the service is friendly and prompt. I always get the shrimp tacos and horchata here. So good and flavorful."}
{"text":"If you order their burrito it comes filled with meat and beans, lettuce and some sour cream is on the side.  Next time I would order something tastier than the chicken, probably shrimp or carnitas since meat is the cenral ingredient.  I am used to burritos filled with rice, guacamole and salsa."}
{"text":"My husband brought me a carne asada burrito from this place.  It was very good and I am looking forward to having another one."}
{"text":"Ate their taco salad bowl two nights in a row while staying in a nearby hotel.  Place was full of Yelper types who also like this place."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food! Jalisco style. I had the tacos with rice and beans. 2 pastor tacos and 1 carne asada. I liked the carne asada better but both were VERY good. They serve both salsa verde and salas rojo. Very reasonable prices... Wish this place was close to home!!"}
{"text":"Oh holly crap you have got to try their FISH TACOS, they're wonderful. The sauce that goes on the tacos is perfect. i wish i lived closer i would eat them every day."}
{"text":"My first experience here was not so great. Decided to give it another shot with my husband. ....and we were not disappointed. The menudo was on point and lengua tacos melted in my mouth. Definitely redeemed it self from first visit. We will be regulars if it continues to serve like this."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! Not only do they serve their tacos full of meat, but they also overflow the to-go box with extras. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I am an AZ native from a large Mexican family and we all cook and make our own tortillas. I'm always looking for authentic Mexico Mexican food and finally found it here. Taco pastor was incredible. Their shredded beef taco was so full of flavor and crunchy. My husband had the carne asada burrito and besides being lean, tender, and so tasty, the tortilla was homemade and perfect! The best part was the four different kind of salsas at their salsa bar which were spicy and delicious. Thankfully they have a drive-through so we'll be there for lunch quite often. This place is clean and great!"}
{"text":"Awesome carnitas, cabeza, and pastor tacos. Great horchata."}
{"text":"This place has great food! Come here every few weeks and always look forward to coming back. They are my go to spot for a bean and cheese burrito! Love it! Will always enjoy this spot, they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Not impressed. The food was bland. They charge extra for everything including soda refills. Plenty of better mexican restaurants out there. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I am glad I went here instead of downtown Mesa for dinner.  Great value and great food.  The menu is very big with lots to choose from.  This is definitely better than your average taco shop.  My parents had entrees with shrimp in them and they commented how good and fresh the shrimp were.  I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"My wife and I live just down the street from this place. Lucky us! It's our go to 'I want Mexican food' joint. Not only are all the entrees I've tried so far good but even the refried beans stand out above others' and that's stupid and shouldn't even be a thing. I'll never check every item they offer off of my 'to try' list 'cause I keep ending up craving something I've already had as soon as I know we're heading there. It's dumb. Help me."}
{"text":"I only come here for the breakfast burritos. The tortilla's taste delicious, it is not like Filibertos overly powdered floured tortillas. I think it is fairly priced for the amount of food you get. They have a salsa bar inside and you can basically grab as many flavors you'd like to try. My only problem with the salsa bar is that they don't pay enough attention to it. There's salsa mixed with other salsa along with the salsa scoopers. The counter of the salsa bar is very messy and sticky and they don't refill the salsa whenever they're low or out. I think it's something that needs to be resolved because the salsa really makes the taste with their food. Another issue, I encountered is the drive thru intercom speaker..I cannot hear what the cashier is saying because it keeps cutting off and making white noises. After awhile, the cashier got annoyed with me and came out and told me to pull forward to the window and just order there. Also another FYI..they charge an additional 0.50 on your order through drive thru on any card. Overall, good breakfast burritos..would only recommend call-in orders/pick up."}
{"text":"I was driving by  on my way to chipotle and honestly it was bomb.com the menudo had great flavor. The huarache de asada was excellent and so were the chicken quesadillas"}
{"text":"Spent about an hour trying to find an authentic Mexican restaurant to cure my fix that I've been longing for all week. And glad we went through with this tiny place! Excellent fish tacos!! Cheese enchiladas were cheesy and the red sauce was great. Perfect balance. Little salsa bar and all 4 were delicious!!! Place was dead but the staff was always busy doing work and extremely friendly. Mis-communication between the lady who took my order, but without any hesitation or hassle she fixed it right away. 

Only down side is the tiny shrimp in the taco which I can't do, but that's just me and I am picky with my shrimp! 

Definitely worth it. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Well it's cinco de mayo so naturally it's mexican food for dinner.  Found this place on yelp and gave it a shot since it had 4 stars and everyone bragged about the tacos. 

The place feels like a real Mexican restaurant.  It had the colors and decor of Mexico.  Even had mexican music playing.   There is a salsa bar with 4 different salsas.  Don't expect chips because to go with the salsa because it's not that type of place.  

I had the number 41, 2 fish taco meal.    The tacos were good, They were 4 star good.  It came with rice and beans which were also authentic.  

My wife had the spinach chicken enchiladas.  They were smothered in a cheesy sauce.  My wife ate one and she liked it.  I had one and didn't care for the chicken, they were 2 stars for me.  I had a large piece of tendon or something.  Plus the chicken seemed dry to me, maybe that's why is smothered in cheese. 

I would try this place for the tacos.  I will try it one more time for the shrimp tacos.   The staff there was 5 stars.  They were helpful, courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"Two years ago I was vacationing out West when I came across this place; saw the police going in, so thought, \"this has got to be good.\"  It did not disappoint.  Can't wait to take my wife there next time we are in AZ."}
{"text":"Was on a taco hunt one Saturday evening and came across Taquitos Jalisco (thanks Yelp). 

The tacos are simply delicious, plain and simple, to the point. I had their pollo, carne asada, and shrimp tacos. Everything was really savory and I wanted to order 10 more, but self-control. I did order some to go for my dad and he LOVED the fish tacos. 

I enjoyed the salsa bar set up. Wished they had lime. Not sure if they were out just that day (sad face)."}
{"text":"This is what I consider the old style taqueria, a hole in the wall place that shows its age.  The food was ok, the service was good, but it just leaves you longing for more.  A remodel, or even an investment on some paint and new furniture would go a long way."}
{"text":"The steak tacos were very good but everything else we ordered ( burrito's, beans, rice etc...) was awful and thrown away in the trash. I remember when this place had excellent food whatever you ordered. The meats are dry and the spices are different. Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish and carnitas street tacos.  The fish was fried nice and crispy with a tasty mayo based sauce.  The carnitas had terrific flavor.  Both were prepared Baja style with lots of tomato, onion and peppers.  Also tried the chicken taco and the chicken was pretty dry.  Not nearly as good as the fish or pork.  Nice clean place with excellent service, great music and pleasant decor.  I'll certainly be back and try some of the other offerings like their pastor and grilled steak."}
{"text":"Definitely the best mexican food in az soo far everything you get Is good!

You cant really pick a favorite dish everything they make is good.

It is always jam packed but it is well worth the wait :)"}
{"text":"Lunch was fast and was very good to eat. I had the chicken fajitas.  The food was fresh.  There are four salsa options, including one based on habaneros."}
{"text":"There food is amazing I've never ordered something I didn't like! The people are always friendly. When I'm craving Mexican food this is my to go place!"}
{"text":"I went in the restaurant and took them a good 20min to get my chips that come with my meal along with that I ordered a large Jamaica and no ice like really to top it off I found hair inside my shrimp the food is good  customer service sucks they need to get it together"}
{"text":"Ben W.  Is correct.  This place is a magical land of Mexican food.  I somehow shut out everything around me and focus on the deliciousness of my fooood! I'm not a fan of carnitas but WOOOW  the carnitas tostada is soooo incredibly delicious. I ordered it the following day after trying my boyfriend's carnitas tostada.  It was cooked to perfection, the burst of favor sent my taste buds into a frenzy,  and the tortilla- oh my goodness- the tortilla makes the prefect crrruuunch noise when it's bitten into. Everything we ordered: El pastor and carnitas tostada,  Carne asada and El pastor tacos,  rice and beans and horchata, out of this world! Highly highly recommend, my fellow yelpers."}
{"text":"We love this place it is authentic !!! Everything we tried so far is amazing !! Highly recommend it !!! Not the nicest looking place but the food makes up for it! We are a regular !"}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Food is good and very authentic. The pastor is delicious and I recommend it."}
{"text":"My fiance and I moved to Mesa coming from Yuma Az where we had the best mexican food... Since moving here its been a struggle to find really good Mexican food that could even come close to what ww grew up with... So we said why not let's try this place out and we are INLOVE first off their chicken and spinach enchiladas are to die for very unique but extremely delishes that was what my fiance got. I Got 2 fish tacos and 2 Pastor tacos...... All I can say is AMAZING.  Pastor is my FAVE and I havent been able to find really good pastor in a while until now.  The beans and rice are equally as delishes.. all the salsa had great flavor and the horchata is amazingly refeshing not too sweet and the taste of cinnamon mmmmm hands down this is our new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"If your looking for great authentic Mexican food for a good price this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for quick, authentic and delicious Mexican street food, this place deserves a visit! The mixed asada and pastor tacos served with a whole grilled onion are terrific. The meat in the tacos is crispy, which is reminiscent of push cart vendors in Mexico. I swear the quesadillas are made with home made flour tortillas and the cheese is authentic gritty queso quesadilla. 

Oh, and the little salsa bar has a variety of tasty salsa's with which to drench your tacos. 

Definitely will be back. If you are in Mesa, give them a try!"}
{"text":"This is your no-frills authentic tacos place. Don't expect anything over the top here. Just straight up good food. They had an awesome salsa bar with 4 different kinds of salsa. All delicious! Tacos were affordable and packed full of flavor! Highly recommend trying this place out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Great burrito with chimichanga style.

Nice flavor, will go here again. I tried burrito with chili verde and chimichanga style... Heaven."}
{"text":"I had green Chile burrito enchilada style.  The tortilla was stuck to the plate as a result of it being placed in the oven or ?    That caused the inside to be scolding hot.   
     Otherwise it was flavorful and good."}
{"text":"I Love this place. This is one of the places I go when I want to treat myself. I love their rolled tacos, enchiladas...even the rice and beans are memorable!  Usually busy and very cozy inside and if you use the drive thru it's moves fairly quickly. A all the way."}
{"text":"Hoooooooo shitttttt.

This place. Lemme tell you a bit about this place. You walk in. At first you think that you look like you don't belong here. But you do. 'Cause this place sells love. And I don't mean sex. I mean taco love. Taco love is a sacred kind of love. If you don't know about taco love, take a knee; I'm gonna tell you allllll about it. 

You start off with the carnitas. The deliciously grilled, perfectly seasoned, slightly smokey goodness of pork that just wants to be wrapped up in a tortilla and put in your mouth. While you're at it, throw in some camarones (that's shrimp for all you non-españoles). They have the tastiest saucy glaze of goodness all up in there. Cooked just right. If it were pasta, I'd have to say al dente. Then check out a little grilled steak or maybe a little al pastor. Throw a cucumber on your grilled steak if you're into that kinda thing... This is taco lovin'; everyone is different... Go ahead, get a little freaky with it. Oh and did I mention that they give you sweet, caramelized, big ole onions to do whatever with? I didn't. But now I just did. I say put them on your carne asada taco, but hey that is just the way I like to experience some down south taco love. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say these are better than the street tacos in Rocky Point. Yes. I said it. 

The horchata is choice. Primo. ¡Excellente!

They have menudo and other stews that are served all day.

They grill the meat out back.

The salsa bar is fresh. 

The girls at the counter like to dance and have a good time, of course after they give you great service and what not. 

I could scrounge enough change (~$1.30) (!!!!!!!) to buy a taco in about two min outside of safeway - not my thing, but it could be! 

Huevos rancheros served all day too. Imagine that. Breakfast whenever. 

The cherry on top: you get the nice mexican jazz party music playing in the background too. None of that mexican country crap. The real stuff. The jams.

And that there is taco love. You finish up and leave. With a belly full of love. 

You should go here. Get some taco lovin'. Write a little yelp review about it and let the world know how good you feel.  This is the kinda love that people go to war for.

Oh and those spicy carrots from the salsa bar were not very flavorful. I dunno what it was, but they were missing something major. 

Ok, now I'm done. See ya!"}
{"text":"After reading all the comments, I finally decide to go for lunch here with a craving for Tacos. 
I have 0 options for tacos as I am vegetarian. 
Kinda disappointed, ordered enchiladas which is not so great. 

3* for the quantity of food offered."}
{"text":"Very small location, so be mindful if you are coming during peak meal hours. Dated yet cozy decor. Large portions, cooked to order freshly. Good salsa bar inside. Staff are friendly but brief and very busy. Food comes out hot and fast. Very large menu, pay at the counter. Taste is very authentic, but the pastor could stand a bit more flavor and tenderness, also no pineapple. Fish taco was very good, had a great tasting sauce. A solid 4 stars, possibly 4.5. Also has a drive through, so be sure to go here if you're in the area and not to patronize corporate fast food instead. Prices were very fair and low for the quantity and quality of food which is very good."}
{"text":"The food here is yummy for the money :) I tried the Birria de Chivo (lamb in a tomato type of gravy), came with Rice and Beans as well as a stack of small, thick flour tortillas...all for $6.75. The lamb was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth....totally delicious and definitely ethnic Mexican cuisine at it's best!"}
{"text":"Don't let the area and appearance fool you.   This place has some great street tacos. I had the chicken taco and it was delicious!   They also have a lil salsa with 4 different salsas.  They were all good, I couldn't pick a favorite and they all had great heat."}
{"text":"Best burritos in Mesa. You gotta try surf&turf burrito for only 6.99. Cheap but the portion and the quality is the top. I hardly finish my burrito by my own. They have drive thru BTW."}
{"text":"****Recent update********
This place has good food but ZERO customer service. If you use the delivery service expect your order to be wrong, they will not send out hot sauce and when you call to complain they just don't care. For extra fun try asking for a manager....

Really disappointed in these guys





***********************************
I have used Eat24 to have them deliver to my house and while the 3rd party delivery service are slow (60 - 80 minutes) and rude, most every time the food has been delicious. I just finished eating the best fajitas I have ever eaten from anywhere and it came from this place. 

So far I have tried the Carne Asada Burrito which was pretty good, Carne asada fries which were just delicious and the Chicken Fajitas which as I mentioned were the best I ever had. 

Enjoy!

***Update we have eaten here many many times since my initial review.***

This place has the best fish tacos I have ever eaten. They have a deal where you can get two Fish Tacos and two Carne Asada tacos for around 7 dollars. Some of my other favorites here are the Grande Breakfast Burrito which is the biggest Burrito I have ever gotten from anywhere, the Chilli Releno pepper which is just $2.99 and smothered in cheese and the Super Nachos. 

This is my favorite place to get Mexican food in AZ."}
{"text":"Finally some mexican food that has an authentic flavor to it. I order the chile relleno, tamale and cheese enchilada special and all though it didn't had beans and rice like the normal platters do I was not disappointed at all. I used the drive thru which is a big plus to have, the wait was no longer than 5 minutes, the girls were friendly and took with me a menu to share with all of you in case it was good. I am happy to report that this will be my go to fast mexican food place from now on."}
{"text":"The taco deals! Two fish tacos and two asada tacos for less than $8. The Jamaica is bomb. We live in Buckeye and whenever we're on this side of town we stop by. The staff is also always very friendly. Salsa bar always stocked that super bright salsa deadly."}
{"text":"I come here specifically for their burritos. I always have a bean and cheese their beans are perfect. My fav burrito is the Chile relleno, super good, I always ask with no rice just the beans and relleno. I have also had the green chili pork. Super good but the pork pieces can be a little big and hard. Super good!"}
{"text":"After eating here about a dozen times and this place being one of my favorite Mexican spots I will never come here again. Yesterday I stopped by and got the chicken fajitas. About an hour later I started getting very sick and long story short ended up in Banners ER with food poisoning. My roommate ate my last little bit of leftovers and started showing symptoms (major diarrhea) this morning."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru the person taking the order kept asking what kind of tamales we wanted. After being told multiple times the kind of tamales we wanted. Then she asked if we wanted a combination and we stated no just rice and beans separate from the tamales.
She still could not get the order right , we had to pull to the side  and we had to wait 30 minutes for our order. To on top it off the order was incorrect.
We asked the lady who brought the order  to speak to the manager. Told us to wait she would notify the manager however we waited some more. Finally I called the restaurant , while waiting outside.  A lady on the phone stated the manager was not in. 
I doubt I will be coming again. 
Poor customer service.
Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Don't let the neighborhood or slightly run-down exterior fool you! Inside you will find a cozy, friendly and delicious environment! We went in there with a party of 10 on a Friday night and our food was ready within 5 minutes. We ordered tamales, tacos, quesadillas and enchiladas and everything was delicious, fresh and authentic. Eat at Taquitos Jalisco with confidence!"}
{"text":"The tortas a must! The service was fast and the food was good! Not too spicy but enough to give it a good kick! I got some tongue and head tacos which was pretty good, and a chicken torta. I have to say it was better than what I was expecting. Best of all, it was affordable!"}
{"text":"bomb mexican food. affordable pricing"}
{"text":"The food was decent. Not bad. The restaurant was a dump! Disgustingly dirty and they weren't even busy!"}
{"text":"My favorite taco place I have found in Arizona. It may not look like much but they have the best carne asada nachos in America. There are a million hole in the wall taco places in Arizona, but this one is the best. The salsa bar is great and it's really cheap. The portions are good and I've never had anything I don't like. The rolled tacos are my second favorite thing. Definitely make the trip, you won't be disappointed. I try to stop in once a week usually on Taco Tuesday and it's never too crazy busy. I actually found this place awhile ago on Yelp while I was looking for carne asada."}
{"text":"Thanks to Mark R for introducing me to this place or I'd never have found it. On the outside it looks like all the other dumpy run down Mexi places in Mesa, but on the inside they have amazing food!  Not only is the food good the prices are cheap.  I also love that they have a drive thru that is quick.

My favorite thing to order is the #12 daily special, for less than $6 you get 2 fish tacos and 2 carne asada tacos with a drink.  The tacos are the small street tacos, but they sure are filling.  I had never had fish tacos until I came here and they are one of my most favorite foods now.  Their steak quesadillas are delicious too.

If you eat/go inside they have a small salsa bar and all of them are tasty with a good amount of heat.  

If you're in the area stop in and check it out. Yum!"}
{"text":"We selected Taquitos Jaliscos from other YELP ratings, looking for some good Mexican food.  This is a \"take out\" spot.  

We are here for SPRING TRAINING.  Hello baseball fans, this is a safe bet for good Mexican and late night cravings.  

I can cook, and I know good Mexican food,,  this place is better than AVERAGE.   

Hospitality was friendly, and welcoming.  
We arrived at 9pm..  the place was fairly busy, I ordered my usual,,  3 Carnitas Street tacos,,  we also ordered the Taco salad, Chicken taquitos, a Chile verde dinner, and a quesadilla.    My tacos came with roasted onions - added a nice flavor,,   all the food was hot, and served to us within 5 minutes of us sitting down.   I can tell a good restaurant by the taste of their fried beans,,   Excellent.    

By the time we were done, the restaurant was packed,, not an OPEN seat in sight.   

a DARK part of town (4 stars) ,, but busy...  

If I am in the area,,  I will RETURN.  

15min drive from our hotel in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is so delicious and hot when you order it. The food is quick and never wrong. The staff is amazing, there are time when the cashiers are a little frazzled and take their stress on you. But it's rare to have that happen, I've been coming here for 8 years and it's always been a great time."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food, amazingly low prices,  clean restaurant,  and friend staff.  Seems like a family runs this place and they care about their customers.  We always get a daily special.... so we leave stuffed and paid about $13 for two people.  Rolled tacos are yummy,  carne asada tacos are fantastic, shredded beef tacos delicious,  and the food isn't greasy! a delicious bargain!  They have a drive thru too by the way but we always dine in."}
{"text":"We will be coming back here soon! Service is great considering how busy they were. I like the self-serve area for salsa, lemons, cucumber, and pickled carrots. The hubby and I shared the menudo (very good) and two of 5 different tacos. The menudo was served with hot corn tortillas and a small generous bowl of chopped onion and cilantro. It was tasty and it wasn't greasy like others we've tried. The cabeza and lengua tacos were our favorite! The pork carnitas, carne asada, and pastor were a bit dry, but still flavorful. We hardly used any salsa with our tacos because they were so good! Our agua frescas were delicious as well. I had the horchata and hubs had tamarindo.

Overall, this place is above average for service, quality, taste, cleanliness, and decor. The bathroom is lacking big time due to the size as well as lack of toilet paper, and hand paper towels. When I walked in there, a large trash bin was on top of the toilet seat, giving the impression that the toilet was out of order."}
{"text":"Voted the top 10 Mexican restaurants in the valley I would say that's pretty good !  Great authentic Mexican food and very friendly and I like that they support our veterans!!  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was awesome! It's a small building but the atmosphere was very inviting. The staff there is great and friendly. They've got a salsa bar with a variety of salsa that is well kept and up to temperature. The food was really good. We got the macho nachos and the Taquitos and guess what? It was served with rice and beans...haha. (You'd have to read my Manuel's review to get that). The prices are reasonable and the food filling. This place well kept and maintained. This will definitely be a spot I'll come back too! They've got a huge menu as well. If you're in the mood for some good Mexican food you should give this place a try."}
{"text":"hard to find a great or even good taco in tempe... drive 10 minutes east and find yourself at an A+ establishment. great salsa bar, best carne I've had in the East Valley (priced to sell the fuck out at 1.74/taco) and my girlfriend tried the chili relleno... which i had to try, which was great. filled an entire dinner plate for $2.99 with that bad bad boy. still; not much reason to stray from a classic plate full of tacos. do it, why not?"}
{"text":"We tried this place and it was very very good! They have a large selection on the menu. The prices were very good, i got 3 tacos for about $1.30 each. The combo plate was large and filling. I will be making another trip here"}
{"text":"At first I was EXCiTED to try it out!!  I got the fish taco combo! Now it was good but not gr8! The beans tasted like they were from a can and the rice portion was soo small. The fish taco was fairly small. The meal alone was $8 which I think should have been more around $6. 

My BF got the shrimp quesadilla. Which was $8 too. The quesadilla was greasy! I was extremely bummed of the overall taste!  I don't know if I'll be returning back!"}
{"text":"Tasty Mexican street cooking but I have to take away a star for the pasty canned tasting beans, and the not-so-fresh fish tacos. I can say that Rubios makes a really fresh taco surprisingly for a fast food type place. The rice was moist and had a really peppery taste which I preferred but you may not. The fish tasted oily like it had been sitting aside in its cold, oily fried batter and then fried again in not so very fresh oil. 

Since I have been cooking this type of food since I was 5, I can safely gauge that this was acceptable Mexican food but that's it. I would probably return here to try something else, perhaps fish tacos are not their thing."}
{"text":"OMG... I cannot believe I haven't reviewed Taquitos Jalisco yet.  Talk about oversight... 

Taquitos Jalisco is the BEST place to get taquitos... in the world.  I say that from a position of authority.  I've tried taquitos far and wide... all around the world.  The perfection of Taquitos Jalisco has yet to be matched.  They are crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and smothered in sour cream and guac... just the way they should be.  The plate also has the BEST rice and beans (ok, the rice is good but the beans are the best) and a small side salad... you know, so you get your greens in. haha  Eat the salad, it's good for you. 

Aside from the excellent taquitos, they also have great shrimp dishes.  And the staff there is always friendly.  The only thing I'll say is they get really busy sometimes so plan ahead. 

Tip - If you're ordering the taquitos, make sure they don't give you the combo #1 which is tacos.  You'll be so sad.  happened to me once and I've had to correct them during the ordering process several times since. Seems taco and taquito is interchangable in Spanish so they automatically default to tacos.  

THIS IS THE BEST TAQUITO ever... and their refried beans are superior, too!

Man... now I'm hungry.

Definitely see you there."}
{"text":"Love this place! One of the best local Mexican joints I've been too. It's super close to work and fairly priced. Between my coworkers and myself this place is visited everyday. Thanks for lunch guys your the best."}
{"text":"Horrible! Carne asada was disgusting, lengua had NO flavor, pastor was terrible, cabeza was average.  The service was equally as terrible.  I speak spanish but my husband doesn't.  The girl at the register was clearly bothered that he was speaking to her in English.  Will never be back."}
{"text":"The chips were warm but not fresh. The salsa was good, a lot of flavor but watery. The guac was decent but not chunky, and it had too much lime. The server was absolutely awful. Won't go back."}
{"text":"This delightful little hole-in-the-wall was wonderful!! Traveling on business, I brought out my trusted friend Yelp to help me decide on lunch.  Mexican sounded good, and the reviews had me excited to try it.

At first, I almost didn't go here, because as I was driving by I questioned whether it was the kind of place safe for a single woman (surrounded by car repair shops, etc) but I decided that nothing on the reviews said anything about it not being a safe neighborhood so I decided to go for it. And so glad I did!!!  

The inside is small, but you really felt transported to south of the border.  I had the diablo shrimp burrito and a tamale.  I always get a tamale at Mexican restaurants to use as my measure of comparison- there's did not disappoint!  The meat was plentiful, and it had good flavor.  And the shrimp inside the burrito was maybe the best I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant.  It was plump, moist, cooked perfectly and there were plenty of them!  I couldn't finish the burrito but I did dig through with my fork to make sure I didn't miss any shrimp.  The \"diablo\" aspect of the burrito definitely made it spicy, but a good spicy.  It wasn't burn your lips off hot, but it was enough to need a refill on my water.  

I also really enjoyed the salsa bar.  It was incredibly fresh, and very clean!  I really liked their tomatillo salsa- it was creamy, tangy, and had the slightest kick of spice.

The service here was friendly and prompt.  The restaurant was clean, though the bathroom door near the knob could stand a quick scrub.  

All in all, this place was incredible!!!  If I'm ever back this way again, I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Best place to come for tacos and other combo plates. Every time I come to this place, it's always clean including the bathrooms. Good food!"}
{"text":"Good little restaurant. Everything I've had here has been good. Tostadas are excellent. Just wish they'd get my order right every time."}
{"text":"It's good, clean and prices are okay too. I love that it's a local business and not a \"chain\" Mexican food place.  It's way better than your typical \"...-bertos\" option. I rather support a local business than a fast food chain! oh, i forgot to mention, the plate portions are super generous! when i come here, i normally get the chilaquiles plate, or the hard shell taco combination plate."}
{"text":"According to the reviews of this place, we were expecting greatness.  Is that what we got?  Not quite, but it was good.  I would highly recommend anything with beans in it.  The beans are by far some of the best I have ever had.  I am a bean connoisseur and believe that beans are one of the \"perfect foods\" so that means a great deal.  The fish tacos were also outstanding.  I loved the creamy sauce mixed with pico on top of the crispy huge chunks of fish.  The chckien on the chicken taco and the beef in the beef quesadilla were both way overvcooked and tough.  The meat in the tacos al pastor was also overcooked and lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Tonight we decided to drive until we saw an authentic looking Mexican restaurant and give it a try. Our adventurous quest served us well! We shared a Pastor Quesadilla. It was delicious and plenty for the two of us. The service was quick and the place was clean as a pin. I can't wait to go back and try the street tacos. 

Note that this is not a mexican restaurant with bowl of chips on the table. I found it refreshing not to be stuffed on chips when the food arrived, but if that is a problem you can probably purchase some chips to eat with the salsa on the salsa bar."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!  We had multiple items delivered, tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc.  Every thing had great flavor. Will definitely order again.  Highly recommended!!!!

Delivery was on time as expected (45 minutes).  Delivery service sent text messages as I requested when setting up account."}
{"text":"My husband and I went through the drive through Monday night and the girl was very rude! We ordered Two steak quesadillas, two steak tacos, and two carne asada tortas. As you can guess that was an expensive ticket. I was very mad and disgusted that I actually threw up their food. We asked her if they cook their beans with Lard or Oil and she said \"lard\" so we then said \"please NO BEANS!\" We don't like or eat pork. So we get home and take a bite of the quesadilla and I could taste the nasty beans with the lard. We specifically asked for no beans and they still added them. I checked the tacos and you could just smell the lard on the tacos too. They must fry the tortillas with lard. It's so disgusting! At that point we just threw all the food out including the tortas. What a waste of money. Poor customer service and poor listening skills. I would not recommend this place. My family is from Jalisco and let me tell you I've never tasted food this bad."}
{"text":"Think I found my Mexican jam! 2 visits so far & the food is bomb! Very clean establishment, lots of food, salsa bar, best darn horchata!!!!! I'll be tearing this place up mucho mucho!"}
{"text":"I've recently moved to the area and this is rapidly becoming my go to place for cheap yet delicious and authentic mexican food. Everytime I come, I find new things I enjoy on the menu. The fish tacos are my favorite so far, with the chile relleno being a close second. The service is always very quick, although could be a little friendlier. I love utilizing the salsa bar. The salsa verde in particular has a nice bite to it. The lobby and salsa bar are always very clean. There aren't many tables inside, but it has an outdoor patio with two big tables and string lights overhead. The surrounding neighborhood is a little on the rough side, hence the loss of a star. I have only been here during the day, so can't say anything about the dinner service or crowd. The food however will definitely keep me coming to this place regularly."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burritos and green salsa..  The salsa bar is perfect.  Fast and friendly service"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad for how much food they give you. The only problem is that carne asada has that same quality of flavors as you would get as if you were shopping at Ranch Market-no frills/extraordinary flavors, but the taste is still there. But overall the place looked promising as it was packed upon entering. Willing to try this place again, but will try something different."}
{"text":"Liked the veggie burrito a lot and the flan not so much.  But again I liked the veggie burrito A LOT!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could find shrimp tacos like these more often. Asada and Pastor were a little dry, but otherwise satisfying."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Super friendly. Everything tastes fresh and the ingredients surprisingly seem very quality. I will definitely be back!!!! YUMS."}
{"text":"What a great little spot to get some good food at a reasonable price. The place seems pretty popular with the locals. I happened to be in the area and was hungry and stumbled upon this gem. The outside and inside are clean. The staff are friendly and very welcoming. The food was delicious and completely satisfied my cravings for authentic Mexican food. Wow!!! - Yum to the Yum!!! Next time I'm in the Mesa / Tempe area, I will have to stop here again. You won't be disappointed at all. The guacamole was probably my favorite, it has an incredible taste and texture. I ordered the #8 daily special and each and every bite hit the spot. Keep up the great work here."}
{"text":"What a surprise! This place has some of the best Mexican food around. I randomly came in here with family, thinking this was just another \"bertos\"  type place. How wrong I was! I had a daily special of chicken and spinach enchiladas. The sauce was excellent, and the chicken was chopped perfectly. I also sampled some of the hard tacos. So good! The super nachos had great toppings, especially the guacamole. And another plate of enchiladas was great, too. I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Nestled between used car lots and and a dive bar, this looks like the kind of place I'd never go. Within, it contains the best Mexican food that I've had anywhere. Most places that I eat, I wonder, why is this or this even on the plate, it's unpalatable and excessive. Jalisco is the place where my wife and I literally eat all of the sauce, every drop of food and liquid on the plate. Everything tastes homemade and delicious. It it never crowded and always provides great food and quick service. We have easily eaten here over 30 times and this is our go to place when we expect a great and affordable meal. Our total ticket price for two people is usually $20 or less. I'm very happy this place is not located in Phoenix or anywhere popular as I enjoy have a private spot that no one seems to know about. 

The fish tacos are the way fish tacos should taste. Tasty, fresh, crunchy, with a midly spicy sauce that is to die for. The enchiladas have the best sauce we have ever tasted. I am not exaggerating when I say that we eat the sauce by the spoonful. My only tiny gripe is that the drink sizes are small, but hey, this is a good place to be if that's my only complaint. 

I've had meals all over Arizona from the cheapest fast food to expensive $200 per person dinners. This Mexican place puts to shame restaurants that routinely charge $30 and up per person. I'm convinced that the only reason most restaurants are open is because people have no where else to go. Jalisco earns it place."}
{"text":"We here once  week love this place super good I love the tacos and nachos  every one in there is nice and the food is awsome"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in my hood. Their refried beans are off the hook; fish tacos are incredible. It can get crowded, and the drive-thru isn't very fast, but it's so far beyond Filiberto's they're in completely different categories."}
{"text":"Great place and great food. Our server Michelle was fantastic and very helpful. Everything and everyone was happy!"}
{"text":"Not restaurant Quality, but homemade quality very yummy!!!!this is my new goto traditional Spanish food"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight,  it was great!  Prices where low.  Service was great.  Food was amazing and portions were  large!"}
{"text":"Love this authentic Mexican joint. A can't miss place as evidenced by regulars like us!"}
{"text":"We found this place to be inexpensive and more tasty than we expected. The soda was flat but that is no big deal when the food is this good. If you are looking for inexpensive Mexican grub, this is the place."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food so I had to try some while I was in an area with so many Hispanics; this place was close and had good reviews so I chose it. I ordered 4 different tacos, one al pastor, carne asada, carnitas, and lengua. They were all very good and the al pastor tacos had pineapple (a very good sign). There was a lot of meat on all of the tacos. I also ordered agua de jamaica, which was homemade and delicious. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Of course nothing is compared to authentic Mexican food from your Nana's kitchen, but if I had to find a place that would compare then it would be here! Reasonably priced food and overall tasty quality!"}
{"text":"This place it legit! A clear leap ahead of any other drive thru/ fast Mexican food place, of which I drive by several just to get here. And I've never regretted it.

I am usually the only white/non-Spanish speaking person in the place when I go and that's a good thing. It seems to be a go to spot for local Hispanic families and workers who usually know best when it comes to these sorts of things. 

Some of the best burritos and tacos anywhere. Everything is good and the salsa bar inside is nice."}
{"text":"Every time I fly into Phoenix I come here for tacos, it's worth the 5 hour flight, I love this place!"}
{"text":"As always so good!  Every time I fly into PHX, I come here for tacos, best place for tacos in the area!"}
{"text":"My friend Chris lives down here and told me this was the best place to come if I wanted some tacos. He was not lying. I had a grilled steak, pork taco, pastor taco, chicken taco and shrimp taco. They were so good. I didn't even need the salsa that's provided for you. It's a hole-in-the-wall type establishment, but that's where you get the BEST food. I had almost wished I had a bigger stomach so that I could try the other tacos. Lol. Don't be afraid of the head taco or tongue taco! Be brave or have someone else order it for you so that you don't think about what you're eating. Ha! I'll be stopping here every time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Great food and prices. Had the #9 combo which is a ton of food. Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"If your ever craving real Mexican food is one of the best tacos are delicious just like I remember from back home in Mexico!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best fish taco's I've ever had! Found out about this fabulous little place through a co-worker and I happen to live around the corner. Highly recommend....and their green chili....just come here"}
{"text":"After searching for an authentic Mexican restaurant i took a chance on Jalisco's because the location back home (Texas) is just as good and boy did the meal hit the spot! Food was hot and made to order, very fresh! Small location inside but definitely will be back to sit outside under the lights! I order chicken quesadillas, while my boyfriend ordered a steak burrito!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru for a solo dinner and got the carne asada tacos (3 street style soft corn tacos) with rice and beans. The woman at the drive through spotted me the few cents because my bill was uneven which was very nice and unnecessary.
Everything was very good and fresh, though the meat was a little spicier than I anticipated with chunks of jalapeños. There was also fresh tomato on everything if you're not a fan like me. I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped from the great reviews but it wasn't bad. I guess I'm just a 'bertos kind of gringo when it comes to fast Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place has come a long way. Great Mexican food if you want some way better than like Filibertos and such. Salsa bar breakfast burritos (add the anaheim green chile) carne asada and even seafood! They've remodeled so good even if you want to eat in."}
{"text":"First time here Got the green chili burrito. Pork. One of the best I've ever had! And definitely the most meat! Quaint and clean, this place is off the hook! Will be back when I'm in the area. Dynamite flavors!"}
{"text":"Fellow Yelpers - Thank You!

I followed your recommendations and stopped here to eat.  It was good!

We ordered 1 quesadilla. #3 (3 red enchiladas) and #17 (red enchilada, chili Relleno and taco).  All were good.

Rice and beans... Also good.

I recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed the chimichanga with verde sauce enchiladas style! It was delicious!! I'll be back to try the tacos!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this amazing locally owned Mexican food restaurant consistently for 8 months now. Every time I am greeted with a smile and the food is expertly crafted for every order. The tacos are to die for, the entrees are unrivaled, and the people are friendly. 
If your looking for a quick bite to eat, or a top quality sit down meal, this place is for anyone and everyone who likes good food."}
{"text":"The young lady at the front is so nice! The restaurant is really clean and well lit. I ordered the carne asada sopes and they were bomb! They have this awesome bright green salsa that tastes good in everything! I found my favorite new taco shop!"}
{"text":"Good and cheap Mexican food. The tacos are some of the better street style tacos I have had in the US.

Unfortunately the drive through can take a comically long time. If there is more than one car in line you are probably better off going inside and ordering to go."}
{"text":"Pretty little dive for some amazing mexican food. The street tacos are amazing and everything along with it was superb. Probably one of the top 5 spots for Mexican food in the east valley."}
{"text":"As good as advertised...  A complete whole in the wall in the middle of nowhere, but possibly the best Mexican Food in the PHX Surrounding market.

Pastor tacos all day long."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little family run Mexican restaurant. I got a fish taco and shrimp quesadilla (Learn from my mistake and don't order this much food. The quesadilla was enormous and plenty of food).

The food arrived quickly and the woman at the counter was helpful and very nice. The restaurant is very clean and has plenty of seating and a TV. They also have a great salsa bar with plenty of salsa to choose from. 

The food here is fantastic. The fish taco had plenty of fish, the tortilla was fresh, and there were an assortment of grilled vegetables inside. I gave it 4 stars because it's not your run of the mill fish taco/mexican restaurant. The shrimp quesadilla also had an amazing filling that consisted of more of the normal cheese and shrimp.

The flavors were outstanding and the only reason I gave it 4 stars was because my quesadilla was pretty salty. But besides that, I will definitely be back to try a lot of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  The tortillas are actually made with lard, so they are top notch.  The carne asada was lean and the taquitos were extra crunchy.  All at an affordable $5.99.  The only downside was the price for drinks.  $2.50 for a large soda with no free refill.  Overall, very, very good."}
{"text":"Wow!!!!! This is the spot for Street Tacos!!!!!! 
@StevePinhero - thank you for the recommendation!
Best street tacos this side of Sonoyta, .
Great food, good service, hole in the wall atmosphere, but don't be deceived."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre California burrito.. I honestly expected it to be so much better! If you are going to eat there, don't order the California."}
{"text":"I'm not quite convinced just yet that this is only a 2 star... I see this place has really good reviews so I'll have to dig a little deeper in what people had and enjoyed and give this place a fighting chance to prove me wrong. 

I had a California burrito, and I would admonish you not to waste your time with it. It's a pretty sorry excuse for a California burrito, and certainly does not live up to one's standards."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food here was way beyond my expectations, and thank goodness for that. I can't think of a time I've ever gone into a restaurant with high expectations then had those expectations blown out of the water with pure awesomeness and then thought to myself \"that wasn't what I was hoping for\".

But onto the review, just to give a heads up the outside does look a bit shady, but the inside was nice and clean. And now that that is out of the way FOOD!!!!
I had the rancho grande and it was very good. Not to mention there was a lot of food. Just as a reference I am 220lbs and saying I can eat can be an understatement, but just eating this combo made me fairly full.

My wife got the green chile pork burrito, and that was also very, and let me stress the VERY on that, good. After trying hers I almost wish I had gotten that instead of my rancho grande. But either way I walked away full and satisfied. To sum it all up on a few lines...

Good food, lots of it, and great price. I recommend going here, I know I'll be back"}
{"text":"Carne Asada tacos are to die for. Had four at $1.10/each and was pleasantly full to the gills. Will return next time in the area."}
{"text":"This place is small, but they make up for it with their affordable and DELICIOUS food. They have the most amazing fish tacos I have ever had, and that is saying something. RUN, don't walk to Jalisco's!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Mesa! Friendly, fast, and Delish! Always come here when craving Mexican food.. Fish tacos are amazing!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and it had generous portions. I had the green enchiladas and rolled Taquitos. So delicious. My only complaint is that they charge .75 for refills on soda. My fiancé and I spent $30.00 on food and they couldn't give us free refills on soda. It would have been a five star rating if it wasn't for that."}
{"text":"First thing i noticed was that it was clean!! That is always a plus. The food was delish. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Such delicious Mexican food! By far the best rolled tacos I've ever had anywhere in the valley. Their street tacos are also worth mentioning but not the best I've ever had. Salsa bar is always stocked with a variety of yummy salsas. I love their horchata as well. Also clean with nice decor."}
{"text":"My go to place for tacos. Their fish tacos are so full and crispy, can't forget also a good price. I usually get the four tacos half carne asada half fish. The best part is there sauces they've got a hot, habanero, green and then guac sauce. Guac sauce is by far my favorite. Other times I'll get a plate with rice and beans which is also cooked amazing. One of the best Mexican spots I've been to"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants now and it has a drive thru which makes it very convenient!"}
{"text":"Very good taco shop food served at a slightly higher/better level than what's typically found in Phoenix. That said the carrots and jalapenos are crazy bland (how is that possible?), and carne asada burritos should NEVER have refried beans in them."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic food!  We were surprised that it was a drive thru and an order at the counter type of place rather than a true sit-down, but the food was really great.  And they do bring the food out to you when it's ready if you order at the counter.  It has a salsa bar and the prices are very reasonable.  I had the Chile Rellenos and my fiancé had chicken tacos, both were great!  We were in Phoenix to visit my Grandpa and grabbed dinner here on our way back to the airport.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"We had the shrimp diablo burrito and al pastor burrito with lettuce/tomato/cheese/rice. So tasty! We also used the delivery service and had it in 40 mins without leaving the house. Perfect!"}
{"text":"This place absolutely blew my taste buds into paradise. Rolled tacos with unique and tasty street tacos to die for and the melon agua refreshing!  A must try!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably great food from a place I consider a hidden gem around the neighborhood. Your traditional Mexican food restaurant, with food made by great cooks. If you eat here once to try the food, you'll be hooked and will make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Came across this place from a coworker even though I probably drove by a hundred times and never noticed it. It was legit! Excellent food and super reasonable pricing! Got the combo #8 with 3 rolled tacos, 1 taco,  1 bean tostada and a small horchata all under 10 bucks and I am stuffed!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the mood for fish tacos so I checked out what my fellow Yelpers enjoyed the most.

We picked the daily special #12, steak quesadilla, and a beef tamale.
-the fish tacos were amazing, fish was cooked perfectly (fried) had diced tomatoes cilantro white onion with a slightly spicy white sauce drizzled on top. The corn tortillas were very moist. The steak taco had white onion cabbage and cilantro. 
- steak quesadilla had white cheese and was seasoned perfectly. The steak was moist and tasted very fresh.
- beef tamale was ok, masa was a bit dry as well as the meat. 

The food was (temperature) hot and everything overall was very fresh.

We did have to wait for 20min in the drive through but thankfully we were under the covered area at the window considering it's 108 degrees outside today. The lady at the drive through was rude which was disappointing too. 

If your in the mood for some pretty amazing fish tacos and steak quesadillas then head over to Tacos Jalisco! Super tasty!!"}
{"text":"The two things that keep this very good mexican restaurant from graduating from Arizona mex to authentic Mexican food are gringo cheese instead of Mexican queso & limones along side the yellow lemons on the salsa bar. These two things & using bag-in-the-box instead of brewed iced tea prevent me from giving it more than a 4 star rating.

The chili in the chili relleno was excellent. With queso panela, Chihuahua, or Oaxaca it would be stupendous. The four salsas were all very good to excellent.

If I were in the neighborhood limited on time, I wouldn't hesitate to eat here, otherwise i'd head to the Taquitos Jalisco on Gilbert Rd.  It's the real deal. If you're at the Gilbert restaurant & feeling adventurous, try their birria (shredded goat stew). It's to die for."}
{"text":"My husband I love this place. You get a lot of food for a decent price and its yummy."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  This place delivers every single time.  The burritos are huge and the spicy is right on.  We love bringing people from out of town here for some delicious Mexican.  The salsa bar never disappointments either.

If you are looking for some heat, get the green chile burro.  It never disappoints.  The chicken diablo burro is another favorite with a good punch of flavor.  Burritos are your best bet for bang for your buck.  Some of the entres are undersized for the cost.  But, they are still getting a 5 for the flavors alone."}
{"text":"This place is great for the whole fam love los taco. It's a def place to go. Great service clean place too."}
{"text":"Love the food. Have the diablo shrimp burrito. Also the flan is awesome!! :) really flavorful and reasonably priced. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place deserves fat five stars! Marinated pork got such good flavor to it. Shrimp taco brings me back to Mexico. Mmm!!! My new found love! It's a cute family owned place. Check it out :-)"}
{"text":"I drive by every week and it only took me a recommendation and years to finally get around to visiting enjoying it.
A friend showed up as I was shooting a Disc Golf Tournament in Scottsdale and tortured me with the wonderful smell of Green Chili Beef. My mouth was watering and I started to fantasize about it. He was nice enough to let me have a taste.It can be hard to find good Green Chili Beef or Pork. Lots of places make it but so few do it right.
I've eaten here 3 times. Always Green Chili for me, but others loved the hard tacos and Enchiladas. 
Only the dark green salsa is good. The others tasted chemically wrong. But the green is spicy and rich in flavor."}
{"text":"Been ordering take out and eating here since Summer '17. Food is good and the service is pretty quick. Food arrives hot. Love the salsa bar and choices. They keep it clean and filled. The avocado/ cucumber salsa is so good! Refills on drinks are 50cents. The taquitos are so good. It comes topped with a spicy guacamole. The menudo is very tasty with honeycomb tripe. Kids meal Cheese Enchiladas is a very big portion. Overall the workers keep the small restaurant space clean. It does get busy around noon. We always order our food for pick up at least 15 mins ahead."}
{"text":"Great food. Huge plates of authentic numminess!! Spicy hot and food was out hot. 
Small inside. There is a drive through for togos. Great place to get some good Mexican food."}
{"text":"The place is a dump and in a dumpy area, but the food is amazing! Tacos are terrific. the Menudo is mean..  and thankfully \"clean\" if you know what I mean?!? Salsa bar rocks. The beans remind me of the kind my Nana used to make.. the only place i've found so far that has accomplished that! Homemade tortillas and Mexican Coke to boot. yeah!"}
{"text":"The breakfasts here are decent. I tried some of the chilaquiles and had the bacon and steak breakfast burrito. A nice perk of this restaurant is that they offer a salsa bar with goodies such as 4 different types of salsa and marinated carrots. 

The burrito was huge! You could do some damage to someone with this as a burrito ballistic device. However, I opted to ingest rather than aggress. There was a ton of bacon and small chopped bits of steak in it. For some, I think this will be a satisfying burrito, but for me I would prefer to have more of a balanced flavor of all the ingredients. Basically all I could taste was bacon and not much of the egg or steak. The chilaquiles were a generous portion of chips, 3 eggs, beans and rice. You have your choice of red or green sauce. The red sauce was overall good with the chips but was leaning more towards being too vinegary or salty for me. 

I also had the horchata. I honestly really didn't like it. It had a weird tangy taste to it and wasn't very refreshing. 

I probably wouldn't go here again solely for the breakfast but I might give them another try for their main meals."}
{"text":"This is a tiny little shop with a nice selection of various meats in burrito, taco, quesadilla, torta, or tostada form. They also offer posole and menudo. I had the al pastor burrito which was only $5. It was packaged nicely and a good portion for your money. It was filled with marinated pork and refried beans. My order came with sliced limes and 2 small containers of red salsa. The ingredients in the burrito were good but tasted too salty to me. Even the bits of pineapple that I could taste in it were salty. I did enjoy the refried beans in it to provide a different textural component.

Service was very friendly and cheerful. While the restaurant is small it is well maintained and there is a TV in the corner playing Mexican game shows and soap operas for your entertainment.

I'll come here again if I'm in the area to try something different. Maybe a taco will be more satisfying! Overall: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"While located in a bit of a dodgy neighborhood (I'm sure it's actually quite alright if you live there), Taquitos Jalisco offers excellent Mexican food on the cheap. Huuuuuge fan of the tacos al pastor.. They even give you double the tortillas. The storefront might look a bit dingy to someone who lives 3 blocks north/on the other side of town (or something), but the service is excellent, the burritos are quite filling and delicious, and while it is a bit difficult to pull out of the parking lot in my slammed-ass car, Taquitos Jalisco has a fan in me."}
{"text":"First time in here.  Got a carne asada chimichanga enchilada style with green sauce combo to go.  Not bad at all, except for the fact that I got a burrito instead of the chimi I ordered.  The beans were awesome and there was plenty of beef in the burrito.  There is a definite language barrier and most of the places hand written signs are in Spanish only.  I'm a little on the fence as to whether it was a language barrier or just a lack of professionalism.  I'm sure I'll be back once I decipher the menu.  Apparently what I got was the number 37.  Call it what you will, it eats good!"}
{"text":"Came here to try the fish tacos everyone posts about which we're not good at all... try Joyride for amazing fish tacos.. but what I did find was the most DELICIOUS bean and cheese burrito and rolled tacos. I will be back. Yum!"}
{"text":"The food was better than most mexican resturants I have been to around here. I liked the salsa bar too. They have pretty much everything you would find at a Filbertos but way better quality."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after seeing the positive reviews here and I certainly wasn't disappointed. The food tasted amazing and was very reasonably priced. Service is quick as well which was great. I will definitely be back again! This place is a hidden gem"}
{"text":"This place is everything I've ever wanted Filibertos to be. I'm so so happy that it actually exists. The food here is amazing. Anything that has their beans in/on it sends me into a frenzy. If I order something without beans I HAVE to at least order a side of them. 
Their carne asada burrito is fantastic. They have a quick drive through that I use all the time (it's near home and my favorite stop after a long day). I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for something so so delicious and fast."}
{"text":"No reason to return...I mean, I would like to return my calories consumed and have them return my monies. How do I do that though? go in and violently projectile my vomit on their filthy floor?? Here is why....the food is DRY and extremely generic and lackluster. They gave me three things of salsa, all were less than 1/3 full, almost looked used up like a 47 year old lifetime hooker. Not to mention these salsa \"cups\" were smaller than a gnats ass. The carne asada meat was donkey grey, the tortillas are purchased and the fish was so dry! The batter on the fish was terr-id and they were overcooked. Match all that with flavorless inedible crap and you have exactly what I got...sidewalk chalk, FTW. I like a lime with my tacos, none. The girl was so rude, she was literally cutting off everything I said. I mean to the point I thought it was a joke. Nope, it wasn't, just rude awful customer service. Her attitude was basically telling me to STFU. Thanks, let's add salt to the wound, that sounds awesome. I will not return, so sad as I had such great expectations....only to be let down. Maybe I set the bar too high, nah, should have just gone to a bar enjoyed a cold one and had a bar taco...hell, would have far exceeded this mess of a place."}
{"text":"Seriously one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. My girlfriend is from Toluca and her family ruined Mexican food for me. I can't eat at the \"Mexican\" places I used to eat anymore because her family makes such delicious Mexican food. But even my girlfriend and her family loves this place. When it's hot out, try their ceviche tostada, it's the best you can get for not actually being in Peru. Their green chile spinach enchiladas special is delicious."}
{"text":"Ok, this hole in the wall restaurant is almost always busy, has a quick drive through, it's clean inside and the food is really really good."}
{"text":"The food is here is amazing. Ingredients are always fresh and ready to be in my tummy. My favorite thing to get is the burrito combo. You get your choice of any burrito + sides of rice, refried beans, and salad. Add guac and the total is still under 10 bucks. The salsa bar is also wonderful with many different varieties of salsa to try. Been here about 4 times now and definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"This is, by far, the best comida casera (homemade food) in the east valley. I recently took my wife for the first time and she loved it. The food is made with fresh ingredients with great skill.   They have this chicken/spinach enchilada plate ($7.95) that is excellent and highly recommended. Can't say too much about this place. Staff is great and food hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"Good food, great price, kind of cramped inside, but an overall good experience. The chicken fajitas were great and can't be beaten for $8.50. The cheese enchiladas were ok but didn't quite hit the spot. Rice, beans, salad, chips & salsa all what you would expect, decent.  We'll probably be back. Food and service each get 4 stars."}
{"text":"I've found it. My go-to spot to satisfy all my Mexican food cravings. Honestly, my hubby had bookmarked Taquitos Jalisco months ago but every time he brought them up, I never was in the mood for it. But finally, finally, we made the 20 minute drive out and ooo boy, nevermind that Los Taquitos is 5 minutes away, I will make this trip because Taquitos Jalisco is that much better.

First off, on the outside, it doesn't look like much. But inside, it's clean, well-decorated, well-lit, and though it's on the smaller side, it definitely feels more cosy rather than cramped. The people are sooo nice too (unlike *cough* Los Taquitos) and their menu choices are ample.

I ended up getting the green chile burrito while the hubby got a plate. The taco on his plate was downright amazing, the taquito was well-hidden between the rice and refried beans so that was a pleasant surprise. Also, the rice and refried beans were piping hot. I mean it bugs me that every time I order a plate, by the time I get to the rice and beans, they're always, always, and I mean always, cold. And that bugs me. So even when i was done with my burrito and tried some of his beans, they were still more than warm.

My burrito was amazing. The hubby seemed to have enjoyed mine more than his own, but you know how it goes, the grass is always greener on the other side. I was exceedingly pleased with my burrito. Unfortunately, I got a little overexcited with this burrito that I forgot to take a picture of all that deliciousness. The tortilla isn't stupid thick either, which makes me feel less guilty about stuffing myself with them rice and beans.

In a nutshell, we'll definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by mentioning that I thought this joint may owned by the same peops as the similarly-named Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale; welp, it's not.

This place has a drive-through window and seating both indoors and outdoors. Does NOT seem to have AC, though. They have fans going full-on making it seem like you're on a runway to help move the air around, I suppose.

The bar features carrots, limes,cucumber slices and 4 different salsas. Limes were fresh and green. Salas were tasty. Carrots were harder and rawer than expected. Cucumbers were good.

My table had some sticky sections and could be noticed when eating.

I got the #1 combo with 3 street tacos, rice and beans (topped with lettuce and tomatoes with dressing). Opted for 2 Steak (Carne Asada) and 1 Marinated Pork (Pastor).

The Steak tacos were best; however, the flavor wasn't anything to write home about.  The flavor of the pork was a bit bland and the the meat was as dry as a Camel's hump. The rice and beans were very good. 

Not sure I would return and can't recommend it either, which is too bad."}
{"text":"There are, in my opinion, several types of Mexican food.
One of them is the type that you stop by at 3 in the morning once you are done partying as another bad decision you are going to make that night. This is one of those places.
The food here was very disappointing and I couldn't even finish half of my huarache.

The redeeming point was their horchata, that was pretty good but then again I seem to like the horchata at am/pm so maybe I'm not the best judge of that."}
{"text":"Love their breakfast machaca burrito and great carne burrito. Once I had their chicken quesadilla, I was hooked. Really like the salsa bar too , carrots and peppers always stocked. It's small but always looks clean and well kept."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! If anybody ever says anything bad about this place you don't know good food."}
{"text":"ERMAHGERD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This INCREDIBLE source of Mexican has been right under my nose for years, and I just tried it for the first time last week! So far the Carnitas are the best in the 480 - at least. I can't not order the Steak, egg, sausage, and cheese burrito also... yes, you heard me.. not just steak egg and cheese.. it's.... ALSO GOT SAUSAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not greasy! High quality meats! I'll probably be having my 3rd meal this week from Taquitos Jalisco super soon, and I'll try a few more items. This destroys all other \"to's\" places. Wow, just WOW!"}
{"text":"This by far one of the best fast Mexican food places I've been to in Mesa, Az
Everything was made fresh, tons of flavor and variety. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Would definitely come again! Even the kids ate everything on their plates."}
{"text":"Loved it! Clean, good food &  customer service.. cant get enough of the horchata. Its made freshly every day"}
{"text":"Took my mother here for some Mexican food (her fave) and this place did not disappoint! Ordered three tacos, al pastor, cabeza, and a fish taco - all three were on point! Fish taco had a bacon cream sauce that caught me by surprise (SO GOOD) fish was crispy and fresh, al pastor was spicy and sweet, and cabeza was melt in your mouth amazing. Rice and beans tasted homemade and fresh salsa bar sent it over the top. Restaurant was super clean and the cute girls behind the counter were super friendly and had great recommendations! Will be coming back here when I am in Mesa"}
{"text":"California (Arizona) burrito with added bacon, sour cream, eggs! AMAZING!! Nice staff, clean inside, and burrito WASN'T greasy."}
{"text":"Iv become a fan of the California burrito.  I know the California burrito is not real mexican food but it's good.  The price was right for the quantity of food.  I knew the place was authentic based on the customers I saw eating there.  The salad bar had very good green and red sauce and the pickled carrots were very good. Would defiantly come back"}
{"text":"What a great place! The staff was super attentive and the menu is amazing. I haven't had a really good taco in a long time and they didn't fail to impress me. Their lengua tacos are the best I have had in Arizona and their salsas are really good. Can't wait to try more off their menu. Everything looks so good!!"}
{"text":"I was on my way to another spot, starving, when I turned to the right and saw all the cars in the parking lot to this hole in the wall. 

So glad I stopped.. I had the chile Colorado lunch special. I arrived at 11:00am and never saw this place slowdown. They definitely have a following. 

Watching the lunch crowd come and go there were at least five plates that passed me and I made a note to try that next time.

My lunch special consisted of big chunks of beef in a red chile Colorado, rice, beans and homemade tortillas (not sure if on site).. Food had good flavor and was too much to finish.

The salsa bar was as expected.. Fresh & appealing.. I will definitely be back .."}
{"text":"Best street tacos i've found since being in mexico... Ive been going here since high school and it hasnt changed a bit in the last 12 years... Prices are fair"}
{"text":"The food was really great but the serviced sucked. I will be going back because the tacos were really good. The torta was plain jane. It had too much mayo but the quesadilla was more than expected. The salsa verde was watery, wouldnt consider it much of a salsa. Also chips are an extra charge. We ordered in the drive thru which was busy for late saturday night. If you ask for extra salsa or chili con zanahorias you have to park and get it yourself which kinda defeats the purpose of drive thru."}
{"text":"fish tacos fish tacos fish tacos! Really though everything I've had from here is great. My favorite Mexican in the city."}
{"text":"Poor service , rude staff 

Long drive thru wait stood there for 20min lay kept saying are you ready to order then to wait


Then when I get home there's hard pieces of meat in my food nothing was fresh

Don't understand while I waited so long to get old food 

Really don't understand how you have 4 stars real shame 

Yelp you let me down today"}
{"text":"It is bittersweet to leave this review, but it's right for people to know. The food was really delicious and fresh but after eating we seen the restaurant has D-rating for health inspections this year. The cleanliness and condition of the kitchen, should be any restaurant's main priority. I do not know the details but certainly would have not gone knowing that. There is potential for illness. I hope they can correct themselves for the future."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our meal here!
Had the enchilada plate, rolled taco combo & Carne Asada burrito (w/enchilada sauce) combo. All our meals were served with rice and beans.
Clean restaurant, older tables & chairs.
Salsa squeeze bottles hot & mild at every table.
Service was friendly and food arrived in a timely manor.
Authentic & delicious. Generous portions. Meals are accompanied by a small plate of fresh sliced lime wedges."}
{"text":"Good food, fresh and fast with friendly service.  What else is there to say.  A regular stop.  If you haven't tried it you should.  I have had all kinds of different things on the menu and everything was great."}
{"text":"Great tacos! I like the OG STYLE street tacos with onions and cilantro and this place does it like no other. I definitely recommend the Asada and Lengua. For ultimate experience you should dine in."}
{"text":"I wanted to give Jalisco four stars, but my conscience just won't let me.  It's good, especially the carnitas and lengua tacos, but the refried beans were average and the carne asada wasn't as tender as it should have been.  Full of flavor, but a little chewy.  

Fast, friendly service, and the value is off the charts."}
{"text":"This is authentic Mexican food, and their tacos are pretty cheap. I liked the Carne asada, but the chicken was quite dry. Don't be fooled by the location, the food is good!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the #31 Hard Shell Taco combo with shredded beef. Yum! Their beans and rice and super flavorful and I always dig into them first. Make sure you try the green salsa too. It's delicious. Friendly service, as well."}
{"text":"I love this place  my husband  love the Quesadilla  all pastor and I get Campechana !!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME.
1. Huge portions
2. Better value than other places like Filibertos or the other *.ertos restaurants.
3. Excellent quality food.  Vibrant and colorful veggies, fresh tortillas, delicious meats.
4. Friendly staff that understands your white boy questions and requests!
5. Clean restaurant!
6. SO FREAKIN GOOD.  My girlfriend and I visited for the first time about two weeks ago.  We've had TJ's probably 5 times together since, and I've gone a few times on my own or with coworkers.

The fish burrito and fish tacos are off the chain.  The breakfast burritos are killer.  I absolutely love the Carne Asada & Bacon burrito - LIKE CRACK!  I eat til I pop!"}
{"text":"Amazing food cheap and quick.  They meats are quality, their quesadillas are my favorite, and their burritos are very good.  Their beans aren't the best (partially mashed re-fried).  A go-to for fast Mexican.  I used to live close, moved, and still drive 8 miles to eat here."}
{"text":"It pisses me off because both times I came here they messed up my order I asked for super nachos no jalapenos every time they give me a jalapenos my girlfriend orders in El pastor burrito with everything on the side only meat in the burrito and they always mess that up as well"}
{"text":"They are very inconsistent in quality.  On good days, I would rate their food very good, but I'm starting to see a lot more bad days and I'm about to give up on them, as it's not worth the gamble.  

I swear they put some kind of artificial lemon juice in their guacamole last time I was there. They seem to screw up their take out orders a lot as well, even when they're not busy.   To have the best chance of having decent food, eat in.  I would recommend the cheese enchiladas if you do."}
{"text":"Let me tell you something and I will make it quick. If you don't believe you can get quality authentic real Mexican food at an affordable price than you obviously have not been to Jalisco. Do yourself a favor stop driving around and go there."}
{"text":"This is a rough looking little strip mall place. The kind of place you see all over the Valley. If you want atmosphere look elsewhere. 

We tried a few different things--tacos, torta and assorted other things. The food was all pretty good--not the best in the world, but good. Tacos are a $1 each. 

Prices were awesome and the service was pretty good also. There's not too much else to say about it."}
{"text":"This place looks like a dive from the outside but inside is very clean.  Fish tacos were excellent!  Our 2nd time here and we really enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Don't let the small dark building fool you. This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant. I had the CarneAsda  burrito. This was by far the best I've had in the states. Bursting with flavors YUMMY. If authentic Mexican food is what crave look no further."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken and carne asada taco with a side of beans. The food is excellent, restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly. Just hope they don't break out the Pinsol mop while you are trying to eat.  Gets a lil loud as well. Grade B+"}
{"text":"Very mom and pop joint. The portions of food vs the cost could be better. Overall the food is great. I have tried mostly all the Mexican traditional plates except anything seafood related. Not a fan of sea food."}
{"text":"After due and diligent research, Taquitos Jalisco was the location where I wanted to experience southwest style Mexican food. I read about wet burritos, and green sauce, and all sorts of things like that and was excited. For the most part, it went really well.

The lengua inside my burrito was exceptionally tender. Like melt in your mouth. Delicious. And the burrito itself was tender; a nice vessel. And yeah, the green sauce... Out east, we have some good burritos, but they generally don't come smothered in green sauce. Or operate in such an alluring way.

Similarly good was the mixed ceviche tostada. Fresh tasting, a bit tart with the juices, and served with the nice, crispy tostada. It was the perfect side dish to the burrito.

My only problem came with the shrimp burrito. The shrimps themselves were bland. Not sure if they were fresh or frozen or what, but they kind of fell flat. This was remedied with some hot sauce, but such a solution shouldn't be needed.

But if you steer clear of the shrimp, this is a very good place. I'd happily go back."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and never had a complaint till today. The staff was rude for the first time ever. They messed up my order because they were so abrupt and short with me. When we got our food and started eating it didn't taste the same as it did last time. The carne Asada was so chewy and tasted freezer burnt. I am so sad, because this really was one of my favorite taco places. :("}
{"text":"Nice local place in Mesa- stopped here a few times over the years when visiting Mesa on business. Food is good and friendly service. Keep an eye on your bill as they rang up 50 cents more than my recipt and it created an issue for me when I went to submit an expense account for reimbursement."}
{"text":"Amazing taquitos! This is a tiny little restaurant with only a few tables. They are fast and people eat quick so the tables turn over quickly. Don't let the line scare you away."}
{"text":"This place has the best tasting mexican food! Very nice staff and a big salsa bar. The bean burrito is soo good tortillas taste homemade. The chicken tacos are also great"}
{"text":"Perfect Mexican food! The chicken and steak tacos are awesome, the chips, salsa, beans and guacamole are all an A++ the ladies that work the counter are also the sweetest people. Great restaurant."}
{"text":"This place a a magical land of Mexican food! There tacos will change your life. They are affordable and delicious. They have the best pastor and the lengua will melt your heart. I have not had a bad taco or a bad anything here. I tried the green enchilada when I was there last and my oh my was it good! The staff is always happy to serve you and the sauces are always fresh. If you need a great place to eat, go out of your way to eat here."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery - delicious!!!  Loved the pork burro enchilada style and the nachos.  Shrimp taco was spicy - nom!"}
{"text":"Coming from the east coast and having the experience of living in NYC, the land of food trucks and ethnic food, this place hit the spot!

 i had the carne asada, it seemed pretty fresh to me, but damn it was spicy too..im not sure if it was the salsa verde or the meat that was spicy..

i loved the old school, mexican cross southern california feel inside.

Strong accents but that didnt stop me from ordering. i'll be back to try the tamale and their rice and beans among others :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food   , if u want Mexican food come here reasonable prices. Always good food no matter what u order"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! $6something for 3 tacos beans and rice and a mini salad. So good! Me and my husband both had the carne Assad tacos and they were good! My husband said his was kinda dry, but the flavor was there. Don't come here looking for a posh environment because it's not. It's a good ol taqueria and I wouldn't change a thing.

Parking lot is a little small, and it's kind of hard to spot the place at first glance but once you make it in there you'll be glad you tried them out! The red salsa is better than the green one, and they have Pepsi in a bottle! :)"}
{"text":"The beans took me back to my grandma's kitchen! Fresh food that tasted so delicious! Love the setting too."}
{"text":"Eh, its ok.  2 stars better than those 'berto's type places in the area.  

Just your usual divey mexican fast casual spot with the usual cliche arrangements of meat, beans, & tortillas. I had a soft taco & some taquitos. 
They have a drive thru, but I went inside, the staff friendly and pretty quick. There's a self serve salsa bar and the establishment isnt the cleanest place, but its definitely not gross.  

The taco was alright, nothing to complain or rave about.  It had some flavor & spice, i was quite happy that it wasnt bland.  
And the taquitos, they require a bit of effort since theyre buried under a pile of lettuce & cheese and dont automatically come with guacamole.  Meh, all that lettuce made some of them soggy & lose their crunch.  

I might go back there again, but its in crappy mesa, so it wont be too soon."}
{"text":"Tried this place because of all the good reviews. Bast thing is the tortillas - another reive said they were almost as good as Carolina's and it's true! 
I used the drive thru and the wait was about 5-6 minutes, not bad for made to order. The staff was friendly and the food was good."}
{"text":"Simply Great! Diverse menu. Salsa bar. Seating indoors and out. Gum ball machines. Friendly staff. Low prices. Quick. Tasty food. Kids meals. Everything you could possibly need, assuming you don't need white table cloths.

Taquitos Jalisco does look a bit sketchy from the outside, but the interior is actually quite nice. Come on in! The restroom could use a remodel, but that's my only criticism. No big thing. They do charge 50 cents for the use of credit and debit cards, but that's a small price to pay for keeping the menu prices so low.

A \"go to\" Mexican spot if you're in the area of Broadway & Alma School or Extension."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Mexican food I've had in Arizona (I know, a big statement, right). Excellent customer service and even better food. Everything is homemade. Good portion sizes. It's family owned and operated, and the family is so sweet. The owner is there like 24/7, basically always in the kitchen cooking up the ridiculously good eats you can count on from this place. Highly recommend their green enchilada sauce - ask for anything on the menu \"enchilada style\" with that verde sauce and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We've been back a few times and consistently good food and good service, especially for being as buys as they are. I seem to like this place more and more each time I go. Local, looks like family run, well prepared food, and reasonable prices across the board. A lot to like about this place."}
{"text":"I come here a lot because it has a drive thru and near my work but the main reason why is because it's really good. Better than a Fili B's or any of those \"Beto\" places. Food is flavorful and not blah tasting!!!"}
{"text":"Carne Asada tacos were very good. New to the area and the Yelp reviews were on the money. This will be a regular stop... Always on the hunt for a good carne asada taco and this place delivered."}
{"text":"I love authentic Mexican food. It is usually found in real dives. This place is hardly a \"dive\".  It is a clean family restaurant. The food is fabulous and among the very best I had had and I have had a lot of great Mexican food. Slow service cost one star but the locals deserve more attention than a touristy gringo. My only regret is this place is not in my home town. I will definitely be back any time I am in the area."}
{"text":"When I first saw the place I wasn't sure what to think. then we went in the people were friendly and welcoming and then we got our food and were blown away. my girlfriend got the shredded beef chimichanga and a couple of Cantina tacos and I got the chicken chimichanga with a cantina taco and everything was superb.  This place at 9:18 p.m. is completely packed. and as we were eating we saw Mesa PD and Fire and Rescue coming in and out obviously a favorite of theirs.  This is a must try you will love it"}
{"text":"We were only passing through Phoenix for a festival, but stopped along in Mesa to get some Mexican food, which all of the border states seem to do spectacularly. 

This place was definitely no exception to the rule. There was only one table left when we arrived and was a constant stream of take away orders ordered and served in the time we were there, most of which appeared to be regulars as the waitstaff seemed to remember and converse with most of the customers.

I had the burrito con camaron (shrimp) for $5.99 which was wonderfully priced considering its shrimp:filling ratio, i had fresh, deliciously spiced shrimp right up til the last bite. It was one of those meals where i should have stopped half way but I simply could not. It was delightful, and worth the almost food coma I experienced after."}
{"text":"My dad and I went there before driving back to Tucson. The burritos were huge and delicious.  This my new go to for breakfast burritos when in Mesa. Fresh salsa bar was great. I don't think I ate much else the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Great! Great place you have here. The food is excellent. I had the fish tacos and one al pastor taco and they were delicious. Small seating area I can imagine when it's super busy but, they have drive through."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for yelp reviewers or I would have never found this place! I am in heaven, fish tacos & re fried beans with amazing hot sauce selection. Yum!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Not much curb appeal, but the inside is quite charming. It has an authentic Mexican décor. They have a wide variety of items, some that are not usually found on traditional Mexican menus. The food was excellent. We didn't leave here hungry. The only thing that was a little annoying, was they charged me 50 cents for using plastic instead of cash."}
{"text":"I have been going for the last two years. Pretty good lunch for casual Mexican place.
Lots of food. I get the chicken or beef fajita burrito. 
Watch the .50 fee on your card and they do not include it on your final receipt.
Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican \"fast food\". Most of the customers were Hispanic, which tells you this food is good and most likely authentic. The fish tacos were flavorful, fresh and delicious. Lots of options and many not typically found in chain Mexican, such as lengua ( tongue) and cabeza ( head) meat options."}
{"text":"I don't go to Mesa often, but when I do...it's for this place right here!

I had a difficult time finding delicious Mexican food that served Lengua tacos and this place does it justice...and they got the salsa bar too with the spicy carrots.  It's a hole in the wall and that's what I love about this authentic place."}
{"text":"Very casual, has a drive through too. Chicken tacos were good but a little dry. Shrimp burrito was good. Guacamole was good. I've had better salsa but the chips were nice and crispy. I would go there again."}
{"text":"The best mexican food in the East Valley, period. Authentic, cheap, and high quality. I have had almost everything on the menu and it has all been amazing."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food in the East Valley. I'm set in my ways and get the carne asada burrito every time (been going here 6 years), and it has never disappointed. They don't pack your burro full of potatoes or beans, but instead you'll get tons of good beef with the perfect balance of onion and beans. Love the beans. Oh, and regardless the item on the menu, you'll leave VERY full for under $7 bucks."}
{"text":"Very good! My kids are all their food.
I tried chicken/spinach enchilada...very good!
Fajitas and street taquitos...all gone!"}
{"text":"This place always have fresh, hot authentic Mexican food. You know they make it right there. And very good portions for the price! I think they should expand a little, everyone I know loves it!!"}
{"text":"Lotta food for a great price and it's delicious.  My order had the wrong meat, but it was still delicious.

They also deliver which is fantastic."}
{"text":"don't be put-off by the outside of this place.  it looks a bit... hole-in-the-wall-ish, which it is.  but the food here is really good (and cheap)!

I ordered their special, which came with a burrito and taquitos.  The taquitos are basically little rolled and fried tacos.  Not very healthy, but sure are delicious.  The best is when you visit the salsa bar and try some of their different salsas.  I think the special, which comes with a drink, ended up only being around $8.  

The salsa bar also has some interesting offerings, such as sliced (possibly pickled?) carrots and other veggies, which we didn't try."}
{"text":"Great price, great food! Been here twice with a friend visiting from out of town. Authentic. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food ever. This family owned restaurant provides great service and food. The enchiladas tortillas were homemade and delicious. The homemade salsa and cheese sauce was great. Visiting  with friends and will return again if in the area."}
{"text":"Best shrimp tacos in Mesa! Hands down. Everyone who works here is so darn friendly. I love this place! Best Mexican food in PHX as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"A very pleasant find.  Some small independent shops just don't seem to care - they're running on autopilot - while others pay attention to details.  I think of it as \"intentionality\".  
This little place is clearly run by someone who is intentional: it is clean, well lit, uncluttered and well maintained.  Things are organized: from their ordering system (stationary iPads), to the kitchen and the staff.  
The food was very tasty.  I had the simple #11 Daily Special: a large cheese Quesadilla and 3 rolled tacos with guacamole. Everything was well prepared and properly cooked - no lumps of un-melted cheese - the tacos were hot, the guac,lettuce and cheese garnish were cold.  And even though I took my food to go, it was placed in the \"to go\" box as carefully as if I were eating in.
I've tried a few places like this that I wouldn't take my family to.  Taquitos Jalisco is now on our family-approved list!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!!!! It looks like a dive spot but the food is fresh, authentic and fantastic! I am not a huge on Mexican food but I go here anytime I am in the area. The daily specials are great because you can get a few different options. The Burros enchilada style and the tamals are my favorite! #19 is great and their rolled tacos are my friends favorite :)"}
{"text":"Very good food. Nice salsa bar, homemade chips and excellent Refried beans. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here. Small quaint a place. Staff was friendly. Food was pretty good. Very close to the flavors in Mexico. Torta with carne asada was great. Horchata was good. Some places are grainy but this one was smooth as it should be. Salsa bar was small but what they had was very good. I will return."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite mexican food in all of phoenix!
I also agree with other reviews and say their Fish Tacos are the best!!
But all around, excellent food in an authentic restaurant with very reasonable prices!

{"text":"Really good food! Like Filibertos but way better.  People are always friendly.  Tried the rolled tacos and machaca breakfest burrito like them both."}
{"text":"What a great little find. Found this place by mistake and had a great meal. Love the tacos and enchiladas. Great food, great customer service and a great value. Would recommend this place to everybody."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food but I placed an order through Eat24, which is only supposed to offer restaurants that deliver to your location. They charged me for it, sent me a confirmation, then waited nearly an hour (how long the delivery was supposed to take) to notify me that I was out of their delivery area and they had cancelled my order. If that's how they do business I think I'll take mine somewhere else."}
{"text":"Some of the best, authentic Mexican I have had outside Mexico. The Sopes were fantastic. I tried them with carne asada and pastor, both were quite tasty.

The horchata was also on point. The chile relleno was probably the best I've had in recent memory. I can't think of a better one I've had that wasn't home cooked."}
{"text":"We were supposed to do Chinese, but decided on Mexican at the last second. We were trying to go somewhere else but they were closed, so  this was our third choice. The food was really good with a large selection and there's a little salsa bar.  The inside is super super tiny and there seriously wasn't room for my daughters wheelchair. It made it very uncomfortable, Plus it's 23 minutes each way. If I was in the area, I'd do the drive thru, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. However, I would recommend this place to anyone passing through."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. Beans and rice are just like moms. Great value! Mounds of food for a great price. I'll be back soon and would recommend this Diamond in the Rough to friends and family."}
{"text":"Discovered this place using Yelp.  We were looking for authentic Mexican food close to our hotel.  Ratings were great, so we went. Unbelievably good!  Excellent salsa!  Margaritas were the best we have ever had!  This is now one of our top stops on our yearly trip!"}
{"text":"Just alright. 

I just moved to Arizona and have yet to find a good taco spot. I saw that the reviews on this place were good and thought I would give it a try. Sad to say I don't believe the reviews reflect the food at all. 

Don't get me wrong, they were good tacos but they weren't 4.5 star tacos. The search for my go-to taco spot continues."}
{"text":"I got used to Tex-Mex, and since I moved to Arizona it has been hard to find Mexican food that taste to what I'm used to. This place is amazingly good! My recommendation is that if you live in an apartment complex to not only put your apartment number, but add your bldg number as well. It was my mistake, and it made it hard for the driver to find my place. Kuddos to you guys for your delicious food!"}
{"text":"It's a good place to go for some authentic mexican food. The workers were nice and the atmosphere was inviting. It's small on the inside but not cramped. I got the tamale with rice and beans on the side. The brand were really good. The tamale was good but could have used a little bit more flavor. You get big portions. I would recommend for anyone in the area."}
{"text":"The Borg are not going to razz about this place, our dining experience was pretty decent for a Friday night...but there was a guy at the counter demanding his money back because he had been waiting over a half-hour for his food. Don't know what happened there, our order was relatively simple: Chile Rellenos (#27 Combo $8.79) and Two Tamales (#4 Combo $6.99), and it arrived within 15 minutes of order. First, the chile rellenos were excellent - not undercooked - smothered in sauce and cheese, on a plate with rice and beans, and a small salad with the most amazing dressing. The Beef Tamales were just a tad dry, but damn good, too. The rice and beans were delicious, the beans had a layer of melted cheese and the warm tortillas that came with were wrapped in foil, nice touch. The salsa bar was somewhat minimal but adequate, the salsa verde was spicy - ay yi yi! There was a red sauce that had an uncommon, smoky chipotle flavor, you not belief! The menu prices that we saw on Yelp are TOTALLY inconsistent with the actual prices, so I'm sending up their new(er) menu, which lists the Two Tamales Combination plate at $6.79, although our receipt says they were $6.99, anyway, for a closer approximation of their prices check my new menu pic. Understandably, prices change, but really, don't let this deter you from trying this spot - the food is authentic and delicious - word up!"}
{"text":"Taquitos Jalisco serves up Mexican street food common to the state of Jalisco.  You might be more familiar with the state capital city, Guadalajara.  This particular restaurant has a \"sister\" property on Gilbert Road that I've heard has better tasting food than this location.  Hmmm... I may have to find out!  as this was very good Mexican street food!  There's a bandwagon forming for Taquitos Jalisco and it's making stops in Mesa!

Let me jump on the bandwagon for a ride too!  I missed the Yelper Lunch UYE here in April, but I scheduled my lunch group to go here this month.  I'd heard from Robyn N and Rand H that the place was small, but had no idea that by small they meant TINY!  The international lunch group that I organize was about 14 deep for lunch!  We were smart enough to arrive early.  Every table was taken once we got in the door.  Thankfully, it was not terribly hot outside and the tables outside were still open.  We gladly occupied those tables under the shade with the roar of the traffic on Broadway whizzing by.

I sat next to my buddy Dawn K and we split our food!  I ordered 3 carne asada Tacos and 2 Tamales.  I will say that I was disappointed with the Tacos.  The carne asada was a little dry for me.  But still tasty enough to enjoy.  The tamales were fantastic!  I split one of my tamales with the entire group so that everyone could get a taste.  But I saved the other for myself for lunch the next day!  Dawn K ordered a platter with 3 things on it.  Enchilada, Taco and a Chile Relleno.  I tried some of her Chile Relleno!  The chile relleno was extremely good.  It was my favorite thing that I tasted.  

I did not try it, but one lunch'er raved about the fish tacos and Robyn N also said their fish tacos were very good.  A slip of the brain as I would have ordered that instead of the carne asada taco.

Everyone in the group was happy, even the vegetarian lunch'er was happy with his veggie burrito!  Score!  This place is worth stopping in and trying.   

Remember, this is definitely a DIVE!  The parking lot is also very small.  It is on the north side of the street.  Pay attention.  The building is so small, you will likely drive past it and miss the turn."}
{"text":"Unbelievably good taquitos and dirt cheap.

Good range of meats, tongue, pastor etc and all tasty, plus bonus of self serve salsa bar with some spicy good stuff.

Staff are really friendly and place is always very clean.

Love this place! No kidding, the food here is as good as the street tacos I've had in Guadaljara and Mexico city."}
{"text":"When you walk in a Saturday night and the place is packed, it's a good sign. When most of the patrons are Mexican, it's a great sign.  Don't let the strip mall location and unassuming exterior signage fool you, this place is the real deal if you want authentic Mexican.

Carbon, Al Pastor, Lengua, and Asada, oh my!  They rocked the beef selection so hard. I could barely contain my excitement as I perused the vast menu of combo plates and a la carte items.  I settled on the 3 taco combo plate to kick things off, and went with a variety pack of carne asada, lengua (yeah, tongue baby!), an al pastor.

They do it right by using those little corn shells, doubled-up for saucy staying power, and piling on the meat.  Tiny tacos, lots of meat, sauce at the table, can't be beat!  

Lengua - mmm.  tasty. kind of like machaca taste but sooo tender and almost fatty feeling.  Really good

Carne Asada - solid choice, as usual.  Probably the least adventurous as it's pretty much just grilled steak, but it was good.

Al Pastor - really interesting flavor on their pastor items.  Loved it, actually, but it may not be for everyone. 

Table sauce selections:

A few in bottles (chipotle, standard milder red, standard crayon-green bottle of habanero death) and then 2 homemades (green chile/tomatillo? and some red one?)

The green homemade sauce had really nice flavor and I made sure to apply liberally to all items.  I suggest you do the same.  After round one, I quickly and regrettably followed up with an order of 2 sopes (pastor and lengua).  They were also excellent, but my stomach had tapped out awhile ago so I only got about half of each down.

If you like authentic Mexican...........

get your Jalisco on."}
{"text":"OMG ! If your craving some bomb Mexican food this is the place ! Food was amazing, staff was friendly and our food was out fast I loved it !!!"}
