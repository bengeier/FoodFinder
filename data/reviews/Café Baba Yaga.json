{"text":"What an absolute gem! Been dying to check this place out since they opened a few weeks ago and I started following them on Instagram. They did not disappoint! We ordered the braised beef pierogies, Turkey schnitzel sandwich and latkes with apple sauce and sour cream. WOW! Hands down the best Polish food I have ever had! The pierogies were plump, soft, with the perfect sear, topped with thick sour cream, sauerkraut and fresh chives. The turkey schnitzel was piping hot, juicy, with a gorgeous crispy coating and served on a fresh challah. BE STILL MY HEART! We finished with the latkes which were expertly cooked...soft and delicious on the inside with the perfect exterior crunch.   I'm always impressed when a restaurant just gets it and this place did exactly that!   5 stars all around from service to pricing to atmosphere to quality of food. I'll definitely be a returning customer whenever my boots land in Montreal. BRAVO!"}
{"text":"Cute little place! Fast take out! Beef pierogies & daily special lamb pierogies were amazing! Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Service is always exceptionally friendly and warm; food is delicious.   Might possibly be one of the best turkey schnitzel in town.  The perogies have a made by nonna feel. They've got a large selection of fillings with daily specials.  They offer soups and desserts. I've yet to try something on the menu that wasn't good.   It's very reasonably priced as well.  The decor is very cute and clean. It kind of gives me the feeling of your nonnas kitchen but modernize.   They offer take out or eat in and out conveniently  placed right in front of the Lionel Groulx metro. Worth the stop in!"}
{"text":"Where do I start with Baba Yaga, Montreal has the most restaurant per capita in North America; I know more than New York City and as a result quality is high across the island. Entering Baba Yaga, it offered a lovely promise of Slavic food, I ordered the Pierogis Jalapeño poppers for brunch for $12 coffee not included. When my order arrived I was served with 3 measly Pierogis, 1 poached egg covered with was they called creme hollandaise which looked in fact more like whipped oil and a hefty serving of no side dish. I asked the waiter if that was all the food there is and his answer was yes they use premium ingredients. I am no expert at premium ingredients but nothing tasted out of the ordinary. In Montreal we are not used to be served plates of food spilling out of the brim but this was an unacceptable amount of food. Baba Yaga you have great promise, location is good and looks are good but you are doing yourself a disservice with your menu. Look around you, go take a look at Green Spot restaurant or Cafe Joe. I wish you all the best but I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! It's a bit on the pricey side, but worth it! My only complaint is that the open hours have reduced significantly since it opened, and it's closed so early during the week that I can't even grab dinner there anymore."}
{"text":"Petit café et petite restauration polonaise , ambiance decontracté et cozy, reconfortant, juste des comptoirs pour manger sur place , pas de tables."}
{"text":"À vrai dire je n'ai que mangé une salade de betterave mais elle était très honnête et généreuse. Étant vegan je ne pouvait goûter leur caramel à la crème ou leur sandwich et soupe qui me semblait délicieuse."}
