{"text":"Have been here 10+ times & have no complaints. The frappes are awesome. Also enjoy the iced caramel machiatto & hot peppermint mocha. The girls are fantastic & always make u try your drink in front of them to make sure it's perfect. I love just sitting under the umbrella listening to the music while enjoying my beverage & the view."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. They have you try the coffee to make sure it's to your liking before you leave. Now to the most important part, the coffee was great!"}
{"text":"I came here because a friend recommended it and it sounded interesting! Of course another friend of ours just wanted to see the half naked servers! But honestly.... The employees were extremely nice and concerned with my satisfaction of the drink made. I ordered a Java chip frappe, I thought it was more sweet than coffee tasting but did not want to tell them that it wasn't exactly what I'd prefer because I didn't think it was a bad drink. But the owner of the establishment overheard me and and was genuinely interested in my feedback. They also made me another drink based on what my feedback was and they made a great vanilla latte for me. I truly liked the service here. The music is great too! I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Kudos for bringing sunshine and great coffee from the big Wash!!!! Viva Snohomish!!!!

Great location right across from Humble Pie & The Main Ingredient.

6 blocks north of I-10 & 7th St. West side of the street."}
{"text":"Be sure to read the last paragraph.

I have visited the store in Phoenix twice now, and have decide that there are too many \"gotchas\" to continue to be a source of coffee for me.  I share this in hopes that if there were errors, they would be corrected, and if it's the business model, then so be it.  

My first visit, I found it disheartening to order a hot Americano and find the the there is no added value above the \"B-Cup\".  I was informed that all the cups above the A-Cup only have two shots of espresso.  So, for the additional 40 cents of so, you get about 4 additional ounces of \"hot water\".  At about 10 cents and ounce, that would make a bottle of water $1.69 for 16.9 ounces, and who would pay that?

The coffee was good, so today I gave it another try.  I ordered the EXACT SAME drink as the first time disregarding the additional cost for the hot water.  Only this time, I was told I would have to pay for \"extra flavor\" because I wanted the same six splendas I had the first time which seemed to add about 40 cents more to the drink.  Evidently, you are only allowed five splendas at no charge.  I reduced it to five splendas and saved that \"extra flavor\" charge of about 40 cents for the single additional splenda packet.  This time, the coffee is not as good, and that charge for extra flavor for a packet of splenda left me feeling like their business model was less about providing a good product with a novel concept, and more like a bait and hustle looking for any opportunity to get a little more profit out of the customer with no added value in return.  

Last week I was talking up the quality of the product and the interesting concept of the bikini barista, but tomorrow, I will have to warn my friends to be wary of the upcharging, or to refrain from patronizing the business altogether.  It's kind of sad because I thought someone had finally got it right.  First have a great product, and then put a novel concept around it.  Unfortunately, a great product and novel concept doesn't keep me coming back with the upcharging for what you get free everywhere else.

The girls are nice, but that only goes so far when it's more about the coffee, and less about them.  If it's the scenery you like, then you will enjoy the place.  If it's a good product at a fair, and at least somewhat competitive price, then stick to the more conservative boutique coffee houses.  Your wallet will fair much better.

This is my experience, and who knows, I could be the only one experiencing this, but more than likely not.

*************************************************************************

Okay, seldom do business owners impress me over the opinions of it's customers, but I have just been impressed by the owners of the Bikini Beans Espresso.  I got a call from the owners extremely fast and I could tell from their efforts to retain me as a customer that they really care about the customer experience.  They explained that, no, there is no upcharge for splenda, and what their \"extra flavor\" upcharge is all about.  I understood, and agreed with their policy, and it made business sense.  They quick response and concern expressed for my experience has me more than happy to give them another try.  He's giving me a free drink, but I would've given them another try based upon the phone call alone.  I think they may have it right after all.  They still have a few adjustments to make, and for that, I can look past today's experience and give them another chance to make me a fan."}
{"text":"Friendly girls in bikinis, or lingerie, making and serving you coffee and tea. Sounds perfect to me!  Recommended if you're in the area and want a drive-thru coffee."}
{"text":"The people working there are always very nice - and I've been there many times. The drinks are really good, the prices are good, and the customer service is great. The music is a little too loud for my taste (I like being able to talk to the person I'm with without screaming), but that wouldn't stop me from going."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to go to in the morning to grab a cup of coffee or my usual drink the Skittles and to my shock and amazement they tried to charge me a dollar fifty extra for an extra can of Red Bull which they've never done to me before so as of this moment I will not be going back"}
{"text":"First time coming here. Kass and Dee were great. Very friendly and helped to recommend a drink that I like - not something they were trying to push. Overall coffee was good, service was nice and quick. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"Nothing better than a Dejah View with my Twisted Bikini Red bull! Dejah is the best. have her make you a Tropikini or a Tangokini! Did I mention how awesome Dejah is!?!"}
{"text":"5 stars haves down! It's always fun stopping through here. I enjoy the straight black coffee...the roast is a custom blend that Regina and her husband created. The frappes, lattes, are delicious. The twisted Red Bull drinks are unique and quite good. Love the protein shake as well. I'd be lying if I didn't say I loved the bikinis more!"}
{"text":"Great coffee! Very friendly service! Will defiantly return."}
{"text":"Good service, but if you're anything of a coffee / espresso snob, their coffee quality is sub-par.  They actually have a nice espresso machine, but they don't use good beans. Bit pricey for the quality of the coffee, but if you come here you know what you're really paying for."}
{"text":"This place is not just pretty girls in bikinis! 
My husband goes to bikini beans on his way to work quite often. At first I was like \"sure they have great coffee\" but after my recent visit I totally agree!!! 
The girls are so nice, friendly and yes pretty BUT the coffee is fantastic!!!
I got a Carmel vanilla latte hot. It was creamy and tasty. I'm a bit of a coffee snob and I give this place 2 thumbs up!!!
Nice work ladies! I was there two days in a row now and anytime I'm in the area I will definitely stop by for a latte! Thanks for thinking outside the box! Another cute place that makes me love Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Bikini beans has the best coffee ever! Love love love this place, the girls are always super sweet and fun too!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday and got the blondie, it was amazing! I came back today and got the white tiger with caramel added.. So amazing! And Courtney was such a pleasure! These women are all so great and all should get a raise! Good job boss man on picking these ladies :)"}
{"text":"My review is EH... The girls are pretty rough around the edges and you do feel a little dirty going to this place.  I am wondering how sanitary it is to have private parts so exposed around food even if it is coffee.  That being said it is quick Ok coffee and you will occasionally get a nice girl but more than not they need to cover up their assets.  The drinks are OK but sanitation is the question here."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite coffee places in town. Not only is the coffee good but I enjoy the smoothies as well. The girls are always nice and friendly."}
{"text":"The girls are good looking enough to cause car accidents when driving by, and the coffee is perfect.  If that weren't true, this would be nothing more than a gimmick.  You pay about $3.50 for a large.  They know just how much cream to put in if you ask for it. This one on 7th Street has a woman named Lauren who works there who is out of this world.  But again, I wouldn't be telling you to check this place out if the coffee wasn't good enough to stand alone. When driving by, be careful, keep one eye on the road if you can."}
{"text":"Coffee and drinks are pretty good. Sometimes the coffee lacks a bit of flavor, but they are always willing to make it right before you leave. 

I've stopped by 3 or 4 times and have always been met with a smile and fast service.  I'll definitely keep coming back for the drinks and \"smiles\""}
{"text":"Consistently the best cup of coffee in Phoenix. And then I order a latte and it's amazing. Like ordering a cheese enchilada at a Mexican restaurant is the first test, if you can't get my plain coffee right, I want nothing to do with ya!!! 

This is one of my favorite stops in my neighborhood because I always get a smile, they know my name, and that great coffee makes a fantastic base for every other drink on the menu! Also, the owners are great neighbors!!!"}
{"text":"The drinks and eye candy at Bikini Beans are both addicting.  The girls are really sweet and beautiful in their sexy bikinis, and I really like the banana creme frappes and green tea & honey drinks.

Ladies, if you are insecure in your relationship or if you have body image issues, stay away from here because the girls are HOT!

If you are cool with the female form, then go to Bikini Beans ASAP!

Seriously, the bikinis are the same ones that you might see girls wearing at any beach, pool, or at Hooters type of restaurant.  So, unless you are really uptight, you WILL enjoy! ;-)"}
{"text":"Stopped in from out of town and got a warm welcome from the girls. The coffee was excellent, my wife and i got the \"nude\" and the \"java chip\" double d's. The baristas were all really nice and welcoming and gave us advice on new drinks. I would definitely suggest stopping by to grab a coffee."}
{"text":"I just got back from trying this shop for the first time on Tuesday afternoon. I have to admit, not a big fan. I had a Java Chip Frap which was OK, but still better than the service I received. The Blonde girl who took my order had a real attitude. Very much into themselves. I got the feeling they were doing me a favor by making me a frap. Two words will come to mind when I think of Bikini Beans, (RUDE & CRUDE). I have a choice, next time Starbucks ! Always great customer service ! *(UPDATE)* ~ The owner E-mailed me and wanted me to come try again, but did not even offer to buy me a cup of coffee. With so many coffee shops to choose from, why would I come back to this DUMP? Great customer service. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Great place to stop in for coffee.  Lively environment with very friendly baristas.  And the best part, the coffee/espresso is amazing!  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Gotta admit i was pleasantly surprised . All the girls were extremely friendly...no attitude at all. 
I played it safe and went with an iced mocha. On par with other coffee shops, but better prices. 
I also had a chance to try the \"twisted redbull\", which is mixed with some kind of syrup and a splash of OJ served on ice. That might be my go-to drink as we head into the summer months. 
Overall, price, originality, friendliness (even the owners) got them 5 stars. 
Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here. We relocated to Phoenix several months ago, and were happy to know there were several Starbucks close to where we live until we found this hidden gem! Since the town we lived in didn't have a Starbucks, and the local coffee shop there was not all that, we were happy to know that we would have a larger selection in coffee shops. I heard about bikini baristas a few years ago and how popular they were in the West Coast, mainly the states of Washington and Oregon, but never thought they had one in Phoenix. I heard about this drive-thru coffee shop through the talk show \"The Doctors\", Cosmopolitan magazine, and how it was trending in the internet of the controversy it was stirring (I recommend check out why). My husband and I were curious to go to this coffee shop and were glad we did. They have so many drinks to choose from, not just coffee. Although making and selling coffee is their specialty, they have something for everyone, such as frozen lemonades, protein shakes, smoothies, teas, and energy drink fusions. They even sell bottled water, but I recommend try the drinks they make. To be honest, their business model reminds me of a cross between Dutch Bros. and Starbucks as far as the quality of their drinks and service but with the baristas being in bikinis. They are very friendly and knowledgeable of the drinks, and if you don't know what to choose from, they will help you through the process of what to decide. What I love about this business is after they make your drink, the baristas will kindly ask you to taste your drink and let them know if you are satisfied. If you don't like the drink, they will make you a new drink, a modified version of the drink to your liking (ex. make a drink less sweet) or something else. But don't forget to give them back the drink you don't like so they can discard it. This is a great selling strategy because as a customer there is nothing more frustrating to have to go back to the drive-thru window to complain about your drink and have them make a new one, or get a refund for it. At least the baristas are solving the problem right there. They are fast as they can be with the service, and their drinks are delicious. I tried most of their drinks, but I usually order their frappes. They have a wide selection of  frappes, my favorite are the textured ones (such as the ones with Oreos, Snickers, or Reese's peanut butter cup). My husband usually orders the iced espresso drinks or frappes. What I think is so cute of their menu is the \"bra cup\" size of their drinks. Instead of the typical small-medium-large drinks, they have them in A-B-C-DD cups sizes. I also like the cute names they have for their drinks. For example, they call their Dirty Chai latte the \"Naughty Chai\" or their energy drinks with bikini names, such as the Tropakini. If you want to know more about this business and their promotions/offers, check their social media pages such as their Instagram and Facebook. If I am not mistaken, they just opened a SnapChat account. I know that on Wednesdays, they have the \"WCW\" (or Women Crush Wednesday) discount where the ladies get a certain discount for their drinks. And if you sign up at the window, they have a little monitor where you check in, and after 10 check-in visits, you get a free drink. We think their drinks taste better than Starbucks and Dutch Bros., and that is saying something! We drive 20-25 minutes on the highway to come here or whenever we are in the downtown Phoenix area. They just opened the Tempe location about a month ago, so if we are in the area we go there, but the Downtown Phoenix location is closer to where we live. And as FYI, we have several Starbucks  and a Dutch Bros. near our residence, but we prefer Bikini Beans. Their drinks are delicious and it's fun to go to this coffee shop and get served by beautiful women in bikinis, they look like models :) Most of the clientele who go there are men, but I give these girls credit for making great drinks! The owners of this business are a married couple and they are very nice to us! Made us feel welcome. It would be nice for Bikini Beans to have other ways to pay, such as using Apple Pay or where I can pay with my phone. Hopefully someday! :) We would also love if the owners of this business open one in the West Valley, like the Glendale-Peoria-Surprise area. They will have great business there since the University of Phoenix stadium is there as well as many shops and restaurants, and a new casino opened in Glendale a few months ago. We know this will favor the Cardinals fan market as well as the tourists and locals there, even celebrities, so the business will do very well over there. Just a thought! The Tempe location caters well to the ASU students and tourists and locals in the area so having one in the West Valley would be great! (Hint to the owners;) ) Keep up the great work Bikini Beans!"}
{"text":"Having been to many other coffee shops and trying their \"Fraps\", I decided to bring my girls (wife and daughter) to bikini beans and try theirs.  The girls ordered a Cocomocha and I ordered an iced Americano.  The Americano was pretty darn good, Bikini Beans has done a great job with the roast they use and sweetened it just the way I wanted it.  The real test was.....the Cocomocha.  The girls said that they were \"THE BEST\" that they had tasted.  I tried the frap and found that it was smooth, not chunky with ice and the flavor was amazing!!  It tastes much like a cookie that is sold by a girls organization annually.  If you get the chance to try Bikini Beans....DO NOT HESITATE.  Thank you for having a great shop, at a great location and a great price!!  KUDOS!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for a couple months now because it's close to my work and who wouldn't want a barista in a bikini making your drink? Well I absolutely adore the baristas because they're friendly and they sincerely care about making you a perfect drink. A good majority of past and present always remember my order and exactly how I like it. Not only that, I love how they ask me to try it even though they've made it for me a thousand times. It's the those little things that counts. Thank you Kass and Kenzie for always going out of your way and for always making sure I leave satisfied and with a smile. Much appreciated!"}
{"text":"The coffee is really good and competes with some of the best shops in town. The problem is the time it takes to get your drink. There may be only one car ahead of you and it will take forever to get your coffee. This is usually not a problem as the regular morning baristas know that people are there to get their coffee and go on about their busy day. The issue comes in when they decide to train someone on the coffee bar in the middle of morning rush. It would be advantageous to train drink making at a later, quieter time. Due to this, I may need to find a new coffee shop for a while until they get their speed back up."}
{"text":"I work down the street from this place and I just had to see what all the fuss was about. Upon pulling into the parking lot, I see this quaint little coffee shop and was greeted by some of the most beautiful women I have seen in the valley. But hey, I came to expect that based on the concept of the shop. However, what I didn't expect was the high level of customer service I receive consistently from every worker there. To me that is the most important thing. They offer genuine customer service and make you really feel like a valued customer. On top of that, the coffee is actually good. It is very strong but not bitter at all. Also the cold beverages are unique and rival any other coffee shop I've ever visited. Seems like the menu caters to the creative coffee drinkers who like to spice things up rather than you daily 1-2 cup work rush coffee drinkers. I really recommend this place, they haven't let me down."}
{"text":"I really have to say that I had the BEST customer service experience at this Bikini Beans today! And it had Zero to do with bikinis!!! LOL Frankly I never would have ever chosen to go to one of these locations, but it was on my way, a drive through and on the right side of the road. I pulled up and the barista was truly the nicest and bubbliest person! I truly enjoyed the little convo with her as I waited for my Americano. Never have I been so amused waiting for coffee! If all of their employees are so nice I may have to look past the \"uniform\" (which I really don't appreciate) and become a customer. And the coffee was pretty good, too!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The chai tea is better than Starbucks!! The girls here are always super friendly and try to remember their customers!  Give it a try you will love it!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and a nice clean and bright location. The servers are friendly and their bikinis rock. It's like going to the beach but getting coffee."}
{"text":"You run a great business Regina! Keep up the good work ladies. Shout out to Sierra, Jill and the other beauties! Great coffee and it's local so support local!"}
{"text":"Very nice friendly atmosphere.  Their are so many beverages to choose from an the ladies are very knowledgeable when comes to coffee an making additions, subtractions, an good ideas for beverages you may want.  Will definitely recommend."}
{"text":"What a strange place, but fun. Very good coffee, loud music, interesting baristas. 4/5."}
{"text":"Nice little coffee spot. 

I recommend getting the infused iced teas. Perfect for these hot summer days. 

-Quick service 
-All smiles 
-Good tasting drinks"}
{"text":"Twisted red bull gets me Everytime. When I'm in the area I stop by for a drink. Well worth it. The concept is dope. Half naked chicks add to the experience. Not too shabby. Lingerie Tuesday and twerk Fridays. Not bad. I don't drink coffee but 1st time I came I experienced the twisted red bull and it became my favorite. Girls are nice and not bad to look at while waiting for your drink."}
{"text":"Drove up here thinking it was just a name and needing a coffee. Nope, some poor girl in a bikini, in the winter, takes my order. It's sad, trying to be the Hooters of coffee and the coffee I got was so watered down it looked like weak tea. There are things I love about Phoenix and things I hate about it like this. This place feels like some dirty old man who came out here from God knows where used his pension to manifest his shitty idea into the world. Hope it's out of business next time I visit home. BBB. Boycott Bikini Bean!"}
{"text":"Jolie made the greatest most delicious mocha frap. Super fun and made me feel like not just another customer #coffeerules ! Quick service from the drive through made this location I'll come to regularly. Must try if you've haven't stopped by yet!"}
{"text":"This is the spot for coffee drinks and friendly staff everything I tried so far is delicious and if you are not sure what to get the staff is always willing to help suggest you something

Service is always served with a smile

I recommend this place to everyone who likes coffee and good drinks"}
{"text":"I'd heard of Bikini Bean Espresso before I came into Phoenix, and being a huge coffee drinker, I decided to stop in when I landed.  In the 4 days I have been in AZ, I've stopped by both Bikini Beans several times (2 visits a day to one or the other).  
The young ladies who work here are really sweet, but the coffee is the real reason to keep coming back.  The Bikini hook is cute, but if the product wasn't good, the lines at both locations wouldn't be so long.  They have combined a novelty hook with a great product.  Just wish they'd do a pop up shop in the hamptons for the summer"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and have no problem driving 25 minutes out of my way to get coffee! Coffee is delicious and affordable! The girls are always sweet and helpful! Courtney is awesome and sweet. I always get the iced nude, it always taste great but yesterday it was perfect because of Stephanie! Today she not only remembered me but made my drink to perfection! Thank you so much STEPHANIE!!! You're amazing! Give her a raise!"}
{"text":"We stopped by on Saturday to pick-up a cold drink on a hot summer day!  The staff was welcoming and super nice.  I enjoyed a cherry italian soda, my husband enjoyed a frozen lemonade and our dog thoroughly enjoyed the free puppuccino...so sweet!  Definitely a quick, reasonable place to stop for a drink with plenty of non-coffee options."}
{"text":"Caramel frappe, iced vanilla Caramel lattes & iced dirty chais are very good. All of the ladies are spectacular!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Been a few times before good coffee no question. This evening was something special though the staff was more than accommodating I believe the girls names were lily and her coworker Valerie made a perfect cup of joe and kept up some great conversation. No sure how anyone could ever go anywhere else. Cheers to them and thank you ladies"}
{"text":"Beautiful baristas and great coffee! I typically go with the Caramel latte...it blows away the caramel macchiato from Starbucks. They need more than one location!!"}
{"text":"I loooove their coffee. i don't even go to starbucks anymore lol. The girls are also very friendly especially Cass (i believe that's her name)"}
{"text":"Ok...Let's get this out of way right now!  Anyone who tells you that they go to this place cause they enjoy the coffee is a damn LIAR!!!  

Is the coffee bad? No, it's not.  It's ok.  The iced chai I had was a bit too iced to the point of almost being frozen.  And the taste was kind of blah.  But did that bother me? Not at all.  The name of the place is called Bikini Beans Espresso.  Notice that coffee is the last thing mentioned in the business name.  

I guess this place was all on the news when it opened, I had no clue.  My girlfriend mentioned it to me after we had breakfast. And being a guy, I couldn't even sugarcoat it and lie about wanting to go and try it out.  

It was cool how the cup sizes for a drink are actual bra cup sizes.  A 16oz is a A cup, 24oz I believe is a B, so on and so forth.  

I didn't know what to expect when we got to the window.  Perhaps some girls in respectable one piece bikinis.  To where they look nice enough to still be respected for earning a honest living as barista and not subjected to being sex objects.  HHEEELLLLLLOOOOO!!!  Man was I wrong! The girl leaned over in a tiny two piece bikini where the top didn't leave much to the imagination.  She was very easy on the eyes, they all were which I imagine you have to be if your working at a place like that.  She was very professional, nice and friendly.  After they took my order the girl told us to pull around to the other side of the building to pick up our order.  DOUBLE HHHHHHEEEELLLLLLOOOOO!!!!  Were greeted by a backside in bright green bikini bottom that again leaves little to the imagine.  

As I'm with my girlfriend waiting for my coffee and trying not to stare at this girl who obviously must do squats in her sleep and every time she stops at a red light while driving.  She handed me my coffee and was very sweet.  That's when my girlfriend leaned over me and told the girl that she had a very nice a$$.  Imagine that! My girlfriend not me was the one who couldn't contain her excitement at the eye candy at Bikini Beans Espresso.

Of course I will go again.  I see that they offer smoothies as well, so I would like to try one of those.  The place still needs quite a bit more improvement.  I swear it looked like they just had a blender in there and that's it. I'm not sure if the place will last though.  People are going for the novelty cause that's not normally something you see.  But if the coffee doesn't improve I could see people looking elsewhere for their coffee fix.  Unless of course your a high school kid."}
{"text":"Besides the beautiful young ladies as eye candy, the coffee was not that good. The drive thru is a joke and laid out in such a way as to make it difficult to use. One visit to check them out but won't return. Too many better coffees in town."}
{"text":"Coffee is excellent, the girls are always a pleasure (even at 7AM)!!  There's rarely a line in the drive-thru, and the coffee is less expensive than their mega-chain competitor."}
{"text":"It was my second time a Bikini and it was a Great experience each time! I go with my Guy pal Josh who lives nearby. He loves the coffee there and I assumed it was All due the the Scenery, but after going the first time I realized they actually make really good coffee drinks! Go Figure!! The girls are always very kind and of course I ask to take a Photo cause it's the Polite thing to do and made sure it was cool to use their photos on Yelp!! Enjoy Boys Enjoy!! You're Welcome!!"}
{"text":"It's purely a Novelty.  It's decent coffee and the service is great.  I could see it becoming a phenomenon, though, if they expanded the coffee menu as well as start serving some pastries."}
{"text":"The girls are super friendly! No matter what your lifestyle choice is they serve customers with the utmost of respect, quality and care! Thank you so much to the ladies who served us today and made our drinks! They were delicious and I even signed up for their electronic rewards program which is super awesome! 
Thanks Bikini Beans!!"}
{"text":"Kickin coffee at a kickass price. The women are beautiful, as expected, and the drive thru gives you man-shivers. Best part is: the customer service is skid without the ego! Humble, sexy, and caffeinated.. perfect way to start ANY day"}
{"text":"Love this place! The drinks are great and the girls are always very friendly. I do feel a little \"pervy\" being they're in bikinis and all but I'm am a guy so what are you going to do. I don't think they would do very well if is was named Sweater Beans Espresso. I definitely go there when I need a quick pick-me-up. Way better than Starbucks!"}
{"text":"Ordered the White Macadamia.  Cass and Angelique turning heads and giving outstanding service.  Awesome place!!"}
{"text":"A good place to go, if your not up tight. The girls are amazing and nice. And the coffee is delicious. Totally recommend it"}
{"text":"I highly recommend bikini beans. The girls were very helpful and provided fast great service. I ordered a iced mocha, a iced white chocolate mocha, and a strawberry banana smoothie for my son. Everything was delicious!  Defiantly give this place a try you won't regret it."}
{"text":"In need of a little \"pick-me-up,\" or \"pick-us-up\" since it was two of us, my husband and I stopped by this tiny little gem of a business on Saturday afternoon.

We had no clue what to expect as I didn't do my homework like I usually do by reading Yelp reviews from others.  We were pleasantly surprised by the friendly service, the quality coffee (mine iced and his hot), and the \"scenery\" aka girls working in their bikinis.

We used the convenient drive through service, but I wasn't surprised to see a handful of guys hanging outside despite the temp that day being around 110 degrees.  Whether you go for the girls in bikinis or the coffee or both, this place is sure to put a smile on your face and pep in your step.  Thanks Caitlin and BBE team!  I look forward to returning next time I find myself in this 'hood and in need of some caffeine."}
{"text":"Was not satisfied with the cookie monster. Tasted like a Jack in The Box Oreo shake.. wasnt even offered whip."}
{"text":"I had not heard of this place till today, so I decided to try it with a buddy. It's a sexy novelty concept, with coffee that is similar to Starbucks in quality. The customer service was excellent! The ladies were very amiable and thorough; they make sure your drink is to your liking.

The variety of frappes and \"cup sizes\" for the given price point was actually a good deal. I ordered the Green Tea Raspberry Frappe and it was... basic. Next time, I'll be sure to try something different. They also offer a couple non-frappe tea choices if that is the caffeinated beverage of your choice.

It was a colder day in Phoenix, so the ladies were not very \"bikini-y.\" I will be sure to try another drink when it is a bit warmer! I would recommend this place over Starbucks any day!"}
{"text":"Just happened to drive by here and have heard great things about Bikini Bean.

I'm super glad we stopped because the drinks were delicious! There is a drive thru or outside seating.  It's super tiny because there's no inside seating. The girls working are very friendly and dress in bikinis, hence the name. Ha.

I ordered the Raspberry green tea smoothie and I can honestly say it was the best drink I've ever had. It was blended smooth and whatever else they put in it made it creamy and tasty. I ordered the B cup size drink, but should have went D cup! My hubby ordered a red bull drink off the menu, something like Juicy. I forget the name. Also delicious! They ask how you like it before you drive off too, which I liked.

I wish I had one close to me!!"}
{"text":"The service and coffee are excellent! Not to mention the beautiful baristas. They were conversational, pleasant and offered to help me decide. The choice was an iced vanilla something but was delicious. I didn't mind the music playing outside as well."}
{"text":"The barista was nice. Made an effort to speak with me (in passenger seat) when my boyfriend was drooling out the window. ;) Wasn't a fan of the coffee, though."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite place to grab a drink on my way to work. The real reason I come by every night is because of D.D, she is so friendly and great to talk to. She always makes time to make you feel important and that she enjoys having you there. I can honestly say if she ever left I think I would have to find a new place to go. So please keep her around she is totally the best ever!!!!"}
{"text":"8/4 Initial Visit.  It was good enough for me to revisit August 6.

Since I don't drink coffee, I called ahead & asked if they had other items to drink.  The ladies indicated they had Protein Shakes, so I went here after my workout at CrossFit Full Strength.  The ladies are hot in their bikinis, & their protein shakes are good.  I like the fact that they ask you to taste the drink in their presence to confirm that you like it before you go.  No indoor seating, so I guess it caters mostly to people who have cars.  (Since I didn't, I just sat outside)  If you ask nicely they will take a picture with you.  (Obviously, always ask before you do so.)"}
{"text":"Girls in Bikinis & Girls in Bikinis... oh and they sell me a cup of whatever. Yeah!"}
{"text":"First time there today they where friendly and fast and they have almond milk to make the drinks with big win o and the girls where cute."}
{"text":"Yes, I am giving 5 stars to a coffee shop with a name and concept that sounds like a cheesy early '90s skinamax flick.  I could be embarrassed by how much I actually enjoyed Bikini Beans Espresso, but why should I be?  I didn't just like the place because I am a dirty nearly middle aged man.  I liked it because it excels at its concept and actually serves up a good cup of coffee as well.

I stopped by Bikini Beans for a few reasons:

1.  I wanted a caffeinated beverage.  Seriously; that's #1.
2.  It wasn't that far out of my way.
3.  But I probably would have gone out of my way because I wanted to be able to say that I bought a cup of coffee from a sex-presso shop at least once in my life.  We all need goals.

Hey.  I'm 34 years old, married, and have a baby on the way.  Getting served coffee by an attractive young girl who's wearing a minimal amount of clothing is probably about as adventurous as I am going to get for a very long time.  The three baristas who were working Thursday afternoon were all lovely in every way.  If the coffee isn't enough of a pick-me-up, than at least they are.  The well placed drive-thru window is big, clear, and low allowing me to be a not-so-subtle perv.  It more-or-less forced me to check the girls out while they brewed the coffee.  The girls were also very personable.  They engaged me in small talk the whole time I was waiting for that my drink.  They even seemed like they were genuinely interested in what I was saying.  Asking me to try my drink and getting my opinion of it before I drove off was also a nice flirtatious touch.

I guess you may be interested in what I thought about that drink.  I had a B Cup of Mocha Frappe.  Not only could I make a lot of dirty sounding similes about holding on to a creamy mocha b cup, but It was delicious.  At $4.25 for 16 ounces, the price is on par with any chain coffee shop.

There's just some barely PG-13 t-and-a going on at Bikini Beans.  Nothing offensive or sleazy.  Just some easy on the eye girls wearing tight and tiny 2-pieces instead of aprons and polo shirts.  If you're near downtown Phoenix and in need of some coffee you may as well live a little and give this shop a try.  Bikini Beans is pretty much the same as Starbucks but a heck of a lot more fun."}
{"text":"I like the concept the low-key maintenance operation with beautiful good-looking girls serving coffee it's all legit sexy innocence I ordered the DD sized smoothie as I gawked at the girls serving up the smoothie but no bathrooms no Wi-Fi just order your coffee/smoothie get under the shade and enjoy your view."}
{"text":"Dutch bros meets Hooters for sure. Drive thru and walk up only. No sitting inside. Staff is obvisouly all girls in bikinis. All the girls are super nice and friendly. 

I got a iced raspberry mocha (not on the menu) because the girl helping me was so nice and asked me what I thought sounded good. My drink was really good. Menu items are named and themed for the store. 

I gave 4 stars instead of 5 only because I wouldn't take my kids here. Draws a rowdier crowd for sure.

Overall good novelty like coffee and different experience."}
{"text":"Seriously! This idea is so cute! Girls in 115 degree weather serving coffee in bikinis. I met the owner as well as another employee and both were so nice. Let me take pictures with them and also the coffee was GREAT and reasonable in price. The only thing I would say is I wish there were more locations! This location is a little bit out of the way for me but I will definitely go again. I ordered the chai tea in a DD cup! Yes they make boobie references on their menu haha love it"}
{"text":"Amazing place. Great coffee, great people, great views! A friend is in the hospital and has been wanting to visit this place for months when I let them know what his situation was they were very gracious and helped us make his day.  Thank you ladies!"}
{"text":"So I heard about the place from some friends and I will admit I was skeptical. No need for any skepticism after today! I stopped in today and was greeted by 3 very friendly, smiling staff members. Great personality and service! I got a 24 oz. Mocha frappe, and it was delicious! It truly was a great frappe! Bikini beans is a fun business idea, and the employees truly are friendly and have great customer service! You can tell they are having fun and enjoy being there. Go by and try it. It definitely is NOT some sleazy, flakey place. Great service, great drink(the one I had :-)), fun atmosphere..I look forward to doing by again :-)"}
{"text":"WTF!!? I went here for a coffee looking forward to something different than the other places I frequent. Started out with a VERY rude and arrogant girl taking my order, service all together was so bad and I got my coffee so and it was NOT anything special and actually didn't have a good taste to it at all. I had a few sips then in the trash it went. What a waste..I wont go to this location ever again however I MAY try another location to see if they can redeem themselves...I am unsure if they are busy because of the girls in bikinis but it's definitely not the coffee... it sucks"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee. Got the white chocolate caramel nude iced. Plus eye candy for my husband.  Wish there were more locations."}
{"text":"Woot Woo!  It's about time!  I was driving down 7th street and spotted some bikini clad girls waving signs about coffee drinks!  It was in the 90's so it was a perfect spot to check this out!  I got an iced coffee and I'm not sure if it was the environment or what I honestly thought it was better than \"bucks\"  and more reasonably priced.  They  had some fun and unusual drinks as well that I will need to go back for.  I have to admit being served by a bunch of girls in bikinis is pretty decent!"}
{"text":"Girls are friendly and beautiful.  The peach tea was refreshing with just enough sweetness and the prices were reasonable.  I will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've been here multiple times and my drinks have always tasted great. My favorite drink is the Nude, the ninja is also very good. The staff is always friendly, and they ask you to taste your drink, and make sure you like it. They can also make the drinks \"skinny.\"
Price wise, just about the same as starbucks. A 24 oz latte cost about $5. They have a check in system where every time you go, you put in your phone number. After the 10th time you get a free drink. 
Over all, Definitely a better choice over starbucks."}
{"text":"Being here is like the 7th circle of hell. I went for coffee a few days ago. Any my experience was awful. My friends told me not to try this place because of several reasons. Poor service, everything is dirty, my order wasn't right. Which makes sense if you have a man controlling and harassing girls all day. Why is this even a place? I give this zero stars. I had to put 1 to write this review. Do not go here. Starbucks and dutch bros are well worth the money compares to here."}
{"text":"I was a bit intimidated before coming here. The pictures didn't help much. It looks like just a bunch of guys stopping by to gawk at the girls (who are very pretty). Who knows how the drinks really compare? After the whole experience, I understand why this place has such high ratings. The ladies are very friendly and the drinks are very good! The twisted bikini is the perfect boost for people who aren't a fan of coffee or anyone who wants more of a refreshing beverage. The tuxedo was VERY sweet. I needed to add a few extra shots, which was recommended from the beginning by the knowledgeable ladies there. The atmosphere reminded of a dutch bros coffee, but with ladies in bikinis. I would definitely stop by again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Been a customer since the very beginning but lately I have not been happy when I visit. I understand it is hard to keep the good baristas around but all the new ones lack of customer service. I used to stop by on my way to work almost daily but now I only try to go when I know Val or Ally will be there, that way I know I will get a greeting smile as I pull up. 
--------------------------------------------------
I guess they don't open at 7am on Sunday anymore. Drove by around 7:30 and it was closed. Oh well, it was good while it lasted."}
{"text":"Its a nice place my mocha frappe was delicious and my husband took and redbull twisted which is oG red bull and strawberry syrup he loved it very sweet for me
But the concept is cool and original will go back when I'm in the area,  but not a lot of sitting to chill.these only like three table but at least it's under the shade.The girls was super energetic and nice Give it a try its was fun!"}
{"text":"Tiny little spot, basically like a Dutch Bros.  Staff was friendly and kept calling me \"honey\". Ordered a green tea, solid tea flavor that was made quickly. Missing one star because outdoor seating area was closed off, and it would have been a perfect day to sip some tea outside."}
{"text":"I work nearby this place and I stumbled upon it because I walked to it thinking it was a Dunkin Donuts. I was way wrong but It was a pleasant surprise! 
It's a smart business move because the girls are super sweet and beautiful. And the coffee is wonderful! 

So far I have ordered the Bikini Palmer (a twist on Arnold Palmer), the Grasshopper (a minty drink w/ delicious amounts of whipped cream), the Lola (A+ iced coffee). All were wonderful and I think my favorite would be the Grasshopper. 

The price of the drinks are cheap, but I wish they were a little cheaper. At Dutch Bros. they include tax in the price, so you always know how much it will be. While at Bikini Beans, they have the price but the tax is about 30 cents more.

Also, there are no discounts other than a \"check-in\" where you enter your phone number and after 10 visits, you get the 11th drink free. Except I don't think the check-in rewards does not work with cash. Maybe they should try a stamp card. 

Other than that, the girls are very sweet, the coffee is delicious, and the items on the menu have such a wide range (from Protein Shakes to Espresso). 
If you're looking for a new coffee experience, Bikini Beans Espresso is a new experience."}
{"text":"Seriously, whoever dreamt up this concept is truly a genius. Fantastic coffee, and fantastic service. One of my favorite coffee spots in town"}
{"text":"Why not come here and have these gorgeous girls serve you coffee in their bikinis :) we went through the drive thru. 

The double D cup chai lattee is perfect. :) not too sweet. I like it."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's got great coffee and a bonus, attractive women!! As much as you may think this is a man's go-to, it's for women too!! They offer a discount on Wednesdays for Woman Crush Wednesday. Drive thru is super fast and they make sure you like your coffee before you leave. I've had the white zombie twice and it's so much better than Starbucks!! I'll be going back for sure!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. When I went the two girls working were 10's! They were both very friendly and one of them even gave my dog a treat! So my dog is also a huge fan of this establishment. Yes the prices are a lot higher than Starbucks. But the views, even if only for a few minutes, were well worth it. If your in the area you will not be disappointed by the coffee or the service."}
{"text":"Coffee was average but the girls were a pick me up boost all by themselves.  Very friendly and definitely eye candy."}
{"text":"After a long difficult day of broken AC fun, I decided I needed some caffeine... and why not add a new shop to the Coffee Tour of Phoenix! I have been to other lingerie coffee shops when I lived in Seattle and I think this place is pretty standard in comparison. The latte/nonfat latte was strong (so that was good), but a bit acidic (not so good). They use espressions beans (I think... saw the bag while there), which is a local roastery (props for that).  Overall, this place is like Starbucks except scantily clad ladies make your coffee... so clearly an improvement. Prices are the same as other coffee shops. Take home point: If you don't mind settling for 'ok' coffee and you're too cheap to go to a strip club, this is your place!


PS Check out their FB page... they have pics of all of the baristas there... and apparently they have 'twerk for tips' Fridays complete with videos... fun times."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee. Saying scantily clad females in the drive-through was a bit unnerving for me as a female."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Every single time I come here the service is great the girls are friendly the drinks were delicious and the service is quick and speedy!

The price compares well to places like Starbucks and Dutch Bros and in my opinion tastes way better!!

Super excited for these guys to One day start spreading across town, because when that day comes I will officially stop drinking Starbucks. 

Check this place out Yelpers 5 STARS!!"}
{"text":"we have been coming here regularly for about 9 months. The girls are always friendly and the drinks taste great. However, I am concerned about their new ordering process, it's adding time and lessening the friendly interactions."}
{"text":"So this place has come a long way the girls are still great and the drinks are getting better. I'm loving the improvement and they have a white chocolate Oreo frozen coffee it's crazy good .. Also their red bull twisters are good and very strong !!"}
{"text":"This was the second time I have visited Bikini Beans, and I must say that this place is awesome! The girls are always so vibrant and energetic, and the coffee is fantastic! Kass helped me out today and made me some coffee. She was super friendly and chatted with me a bit before taking my order. I wasn't sure what I wanted to I asked her to make me her favorite. She made me a Nude with an extra shot of espresso and it was to die for! I will definitely be coming back here for coffee, even though it is a bit far from home, it is worth it! Hopefully Kass will be there to help me out, because she is amazing!"}
{"text":"The coffee was amazing. The girls were nice not over the top annoying. They ask you to try your coffee to make sure you like it (saves a trip back!). The drive-thru set up is easy. Good location."}
{"text":"Drove passed the one in Tempe.  Looked it up and found this location.  So happy ! The gals are so sweet from ordering to picking up drink.  2nd time here, both time I went with their suggest so glad I did. Delightful!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've not yet written a review of this place!

First, I will confess, I wasn't excited about Bikini Beans moving into the neighborhood. I'm so much of a \"beauty is temporary but brains will take you places\" kind of girl. But my college-aged stepdaughter LOVES this place & so we swung by for java before a hike. Wow! Forget beauty & brains, this place is all about the BEANS!

Seriously, yes, beautiful girls in swimsuits is an effective marketing gimmick (that results in a never-ending stream of cars going thru their drive), but they take their coffe seriously! My \"go to\" drink is the Caramel Macchioto with coconut milk, hot or iced, and it's fantastic! It's the perfect balance of coffee bite, smoothness & sweetness! Every first sip just makes me smile because my mouth is so happy!

But try the other drinks as well! We highly recommend their chai which is the best we've had in the Valley - neither too spicy nor too sweet. Just the perfect balance of tea, spice & cream. 

TIPS: Be sure to check in on their kiosk because every 10 visits gets you a free drink.
