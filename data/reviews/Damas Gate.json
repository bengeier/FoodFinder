{"text":"I had a shawarma with a piece of glass in it. After spitting it out and putting on the plate. It was 100% glass, the waitress confirmed and got the owner. When the owner came, he blamed us because he said that it was impossible for a piece of glass (like a nicked drinking glass shard) could get in there and we shouldn't blame him. We were never offered a replacement shawarma (even though the one with glass wasn't finished) and were left with the impression that we placed the glass there ourselves.  If you like glass in your food and then be treated rudely for it, come here!!!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place as it's so close to home, but the food was just so bad. The service was nice, but I have never had a shawarma that was as bland, tasteless and dry as this one. It was like chewing on wood chips. We ordered take out, and so we did not know what we had until we opened it up at home. The dry meat came with no sauce - which - part of me feels may have won this place a 2.5* because then at least there would be some kind of flavour and it would have added moisture. The best part of the dish might have been the pita bread ... and even then I'm not sure. We ordered two dishes and barely got through half of one because it was just not palatable.   On a positive note, the dining room looked nice! They are still new so maybe they are still trying to work out some kinks but we probably won't be back for at least a few months.   In conclusion: 0 stars for food and 2 stars for nice restaurant staff"}

{"text":"Terrible soggy shawarma, tasteless Shish Taouk...just an awful mess...came for a takeout and think the guy just had a fight with his server who stormed out of the empty restaurant as I was walking in...against my better judgement I decided to give this place a chance. His awful mood showed in the way he prepared my food...and the way the food tasted...I am done with this place"}
{"text":"Tasty Middle Eastern food, especially the Hummus and the Mankeesh.  Would definitely come back again."}
