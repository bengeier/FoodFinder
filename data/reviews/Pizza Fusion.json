{"text":"Love this place, we usually don't eat much pizza because my son is lactose intolerant, but they had a soy cheese that was really good. i couldn't tell the difference. This place looks like it was made over by the resteraunt impossible team."}
{"text":"We love the beet and feta salad!
The blond young waitress was loud and rude, texting, boasting that she made $102 in tips on a Wed, took money out of the register to get a coffee from next door, loud, swearing, proud that her rent check bounced and she pays less to her bills because at least then she feels like an adult (nope cannot make this up), trying to not drink for at least two days....hello all in front of my 8 year old...
Guess I will be making my own beat & feta salad!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! They have yummy, thin crust. The sauce is what's really amazing... I can never decide what to get because I want everything!!!!! Try it ;)"}
{"text":"This place is great! Excellent customer service, great food, and reasonable prices. VERY HAPPY that they have Vegan options. Love that they have specials throughout the weekdays, this will undoubtedly bring us in more frequently. It's a nice, quaint little place that I consider good for families and good for a date night too. I would say what separates them from other pizza places is their care on their environmental impact, the Vegan options (they have a Lot), and the ability to get your child a healthy organic juice while you sip on a glass of wine. Highly recommend trying!!!"}
{"text":"love this place! Im not a vegetarian, but their veggie pizza is AWESOME! The service has improved a lot since they opened and the wraps are yummy. PLUS they have a selection of organic wines : )"}
{"text":"Now my fav pizza in charlotte. Fresh ingredients, great sauce, awesome service, clean place.  Definitely a must see!!"}
{"text":"I am very familiar with Pizza Fusion as I used to live near one of the first stores in Palm Beach Gardens ( a check of their site makes me think it is closed now) At that point they were more up market, Prius delivery, green organic etc. 

The store here feels much more fast food feel.. and it is  fast,  the pizza was quite good for the price. ... Crisp crust, correct topping/crust/cheese ratio, and very good quality cheese. 

I was surprised to see a conveyor pizza oven so promently displayed, generally that is reserved for wood fired  or at least deck ovens....

Solid choice before shopping at TJ's so you don't buy the store..."}
{"text":"Serving organic pizza realness. Boom.
Delicious pizza, excellent service. Try the sausage & tri-color pepper pizza. O. M. G."}
{"text":"I love Pizza Fusion! If you are looking for organic pizza, this is the place. The topping menu is extensive. All of the ingredients are fresh. No more guilt ordering pizza for the family on Friday night! My daughter is a vegan and she is obsessed with the pizza! So glad Pizza Fusion has come to Charlotte! Note to people reading other reviews: Pizza Fusion is a different kind of pizza restaurant. If you are looking for a dusty old pizzeria where you can buy a pizza for dirt cheap, this is not the place for you. If you'd like to eat clean, pesticide free, fresh pizza then look no further!"}
{"text":"If my review were based on food alone, it'd be 4, maybe 5 stars.  But the service really drags it down and makes the whole experience a huge waste of time.

The place is small, so you've gotta wait.  No big deal.  The problems began when we were seated at a table with, what amounted to, half of a pizza (in scraps and crumbs) on the floor.
Next, the service was awful.  Parts of orders were wrong, there was zero eye contact, and lots of rushing around to get back to a conversation with a friend.  Not cool.  Everything took FOREVER.  On a busy night, I expect to wait a little for food if the kitchen gets swamped.  I don't expect to wait 15 minutes for a water.  This guys also had the personality of a goldfish.  Clearly, any service industry job is just not for him.

The pizzas we had were very tasty.  Nothing to complain about.  Food was mostly hot and the portions were adequate.  

I also had the brownie for dessert.  Just skip it.  They make yummy pizza but miss the mark on the baked goods."}
{"text":"They have the best gluten free pizza in all of Charlotte! I have searched all over the city for a good, normal tasting GF pizza and this is it! It is like heaven in your mouth.  They also make lots of other great food that is gluten free and vegan. If you must eat gluten free this is your place to go. The manager and staff are friendly and great too."}
{"text":"1st was good. 2bd time was even better! Salad good. Pizza was outstanding. Staff remembered us and the salad we ordered the 1st time. I'm impressed! Will definitely make it a 3rd time. So sad.....out of business..."}
{"text":"The prices are a little high.. But they do have a good lunch special, you get a personal pizza a side salad, and a drink for $8.  I have been here 3 times now and everything has been good! No complaints!"}
{"text":"This is a new place that just opened not to long ago right around the corner from me. 

I took my Mom there for lunch a couple days ago, at first we were the only people in the place.  But not too long after we arrived other people started coming in as well.

It's a clean little place.  I feel like the whole \"green\" theme is a bit hokey... but I like the organic ingredients.  Those with gluten allergies will appreciate the gluten-free menu options.

We went back today for a to-go order, and will likely do so many more times in the future.  If you're tired of the same old greasy pizza, definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I love Pizza Fusion because it is delicious and healthy at the same time!! The restaurant is also Earth friendly which is awesome and so rare. They even have natural soda options as well as wine and beer."}
{"text":"Quick Review: Organic, sustainable, fresh. Really friendly people, and a nice casual setting.  

Pizza Fusion has stores in 6 states (and I was also told, Saudi Arabia of all places!). I first fell in love with the concept when I lived in Kansas. (This one is next to Which Which and Zoe's)  PF is about social-responsibility, and knowing where your food comes from... using the freshest, organic ingredients (when possible).  One of the employees told me their counter tops for example,  are from reclaimed materials, and the restaurant is as \"green\" as possible. 

First step: order at the counter. (Notice a case of drinks with no HFC's, and the Boylan's soda fountain machine. No Coke here!)

You can get the crust in white, multi-grain or gluten-free.  The toppings are really fresh, and it results in a non-greasy, good feeling pizza.  (No bloat-y cheese tummy after consumption.) I've been to this location twice in one week and sampled the artichoke spinach pie, eggplant mozz and BBQ chicken, along with the meatball sliders, house salad and feta walnut salad.  (Yeah, I don't mess around!)  We even got this hazelnut (Nutella-like) dessert pie with candied walnuts.  Everything was delicious...especially the BBQ chicken pizza.  

I like how friendly everyone is, and how if you engage them in conversation, they'll tell you insider info on the restaurant, like what kind of cheese they use, or how the dough is made from scratch.  

Looking forward to trying more items!

TIP 1: The pizza is flatbread style-- so it's in an oblong shape.  

TIP 2: Since it's their soft-opening week, they at last check don't have some items, like pumpkin cheesecake or the Boylan's machine up and running.  Supplier issues I was told will be fixed in the coming weeks. 

TIP 3: Lunch specials are about $8 for a regular personal pizza, side and drink.

TIP 4: If you live in the Met, you get a discount!"}
{"text":"this place is delicious! super excited to have options like this in vegas for people that are concerned about the functionality of their hearts and other vital organs and what not. i had the sun dried tomato something or other pizza with whole grain and vegan cheese. it made me want to break dance, or at least learn how to juggle. it was inspiring. service was great. blah blah blah words words words go eat there thank you."}
{"text":"Yet another Gluten-Free/Celiac Friendly Gem in the Pittsburgh Area!!!  They also gladly cleaned their work station area to avoid cross-contamination as best as possible.

I never knew this place existed until a few months ago, they should definitely invest in better press or even advertise they are gluten-free friendly.  I found this place by chance when googling for gluten-free restaurants in the Pittsburgh area.  I promptly told my boyfriend and away we went the next evening.

We didn't get to dine-in  because they were closing the dining area early, in fact, it was very early.  We got there around 830 or 900PM and they told us they were sorry they closed it early because they were slow.  Mind you, this was a Friday night.  We were pretty disappointed about that but we decided to order and take it the whole way back to Squirrel Hill to enjoy it at my boyfriend's house.  Surprisingly, the pizza was still hot and lasted the entire way home without getting gummy or soggy or nasty like most chain pizzas.

We ordered the Gluten-Free Crust with the Pizza Classica style.  It was excellent.  The cheese tasted like real cheese and the sauce (which I am normally not a fan of) was just as excellent.  I couldn't get over how flavorful it was.  Not to mention the fact that the pizza crust was soft and chewy just like normal pizza crust!  I never thought I would be able to eat a good tasting pizza again in my life before we went here.  They definitely will have a repeat customer with us!

Of course, as expected, because of the \"healthy and environmentally friendly\" tag the prices are a bit expensive.  However, I think you definitely get a decent portion size for the price.  We felt full and still had a few pieces left over for the next day.  This isn't your normal chain."}
{"text":"This is for delivery - POOR.

Online ordering - GOOD.

Delivery time - GREAT for a Friday night, prime time. Confirmation said it would be 60 minutes; driver arrived in hotel lobby in 35 minutes.

Execution - POOR.
1. I ordered a beer. Driver said they didn't have beer, and someone should have called me. Yet the receipt she wanted me to sign still had the beer.
2. In light of no beer, no follow-up call, and a bad receipt, I asked about a fork/napkin. The driver said they didn't have any. 
3. My takeaway was that this place has no beer or forks/napkins for delivery orders.
4. The manager calls an hour later and leaves a terse message. She needs me to call back with my credit card number so she can rerun the charge. 
5. Despite the poor service and terse message, I call back. I am doing them a favor, yes? But you'd think they were doing me a favor given the tone of the conversation. 
6. Apparently the driver forgot the beer or maybe they were out of what I wanted, who knows, the story changed. And the restaurant does in fact have delivery forks/napkins but the driver forgot to include them.

Follow up - PENDING.
The manager removed the carrot cake after I fussed about the poor service and asked to delete my tip. I'll edit this review if the credit is properly processed and the new charge is correct."}
{"text":"I don't eat pizza often- except Grimaldi's which I adore- and really wanted to like this place based on the concept. The pizza (greek and home pie) both came covered in salty overwhelming black olive mixture that should've been used very sparingly.  The toppings were sparse and this truly is not pizza- it's a rectangular flat bread.  My house salad was tiny and plain.  I give them two stars for their beer and wine selection.  This place left me and my boyfriend wishing we'd gone to our usual spot on Eastern- Grimaldi's.   Heck- even the pre-made pizza dough do-it-yourself stuff at Trader Joe's (it's in the same parking lot) tastes been WAY better.  We ordered for pickup- had we sat in the restaurant maybe the quality would've been better??  I'm not going back to find out."}
{"text":"We had some errands to run at Target so we thought we'd give Pizza Fusion a try.  I got a Caesar salad and  we decided to get 2 individual pizzas, Tim went for the BBQ chicken and I made my own gluten free personal pizza with artichokes, mushrooms, feta and bacon.  They were pretty stingy with the bacon and feta and the sauce was super heavy and sweet, I wiped a bunch of it off.  The salad was not the best,  the dressing was lumpy and oily and was on the side,  there was maybe 2 or 3 shreds of cheese on the salad, not worth the $6 at all.  

The gluten free pizza crust was decent (California Pizza Kitchen has the best in CLT), it was slightly sweet as most GF pizzas are and it didn't help that the sauce was also sweet.  It held together surprisingly well and had more dough to it than most, it wasn't a crispy flatbread.  

Hours after dinner Tim said he still had the tang of the BBQ sauce on his tongue, I didn't try it but he said it was just too much vinegar for a pizza sauce.  

I'm glad I found another place that makes a decent GF pizza, but at $42 for 2 personal pizzas, waters, a salad and a beer we could have gone to Brixx down the road and had a better experience and more food for the money."}
{"text":"When I saw the sign going up that read \"Pizza Fusion\" I was elated! I've been waiting for this place to open since then. But, I guess too much anticipation isn't always a good thing. I consider myself a purist when it comes to pizza. Mainly, striclty cheese. I just don't think it needs much else. So that's what I had for lunch at Pizza Fusion. They have a lunch special that includes a cheese pie, salad and drink for $8. Or a specialty pie, salad and drink for $11. Pretty good deal. I don't eat salad. So I had a personal cheese pie and a wonderful Boylan Ginger Ale. The personal pie and soda was almost $10. I sat outside awaiting the arrival of my pizza and the server gets to the door leading outside and SPLAT!!!!!!!!!! My pizza is on the ground. She promptly picked it up and went back inside. Came back outside, cleaned up the sauce, went back inside, came back outside and told me my pizza would be out shortly. This didn't put a bad taste in my mouth about the place. It's in a great location, nice atmosphere, and I'm just a laid back person lol. So the next one comes and, it's less than stunning. It looked like a little school pizza. My first though was \"wow, I paid $10 for this?\" The sauce was one note the crust was okay, the cheese was good. (When is cheese not good?) It really needed something to make it POP! (extra toppings perhaps? Nah) I was expecting a lot more. The concept is pretty cool, organic and sustainability. I'm just not quite sure where the \"fusion\" part comes in. I didn't go in depth into the menu, but there was nothing \"fused\" about it. Maybe I missed something. Overall it was a cool place to sit outside and have lunch. Just don't expect the pizza to WOW you."}
{"text":"Thank you Groupon.  I have been wanting to try this place but I am always scared of spending alot of money and not leaving happy.  I must say this was the BEST pizza I have had in a very long time.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Not your typical pittsburgh pizza.   Came here because we had a few people with eating restrictions in our group.   The pizza is super thin and pretty small.   I could probably put away at least two personal pizzas in one sitting.  The Regular size is also too small if you have some eaters in your group.  I enjoyed the pizza and felt it was a nice change from all the heavy cheese and oil pizzas of the city.   Our friends found the gluten free soy pizza descent (spinach and artichoke).  Their quote was \"not great but not bad.\"    Their menu looked interesting and will be back to try other items soon.   It was like the ratings say A-OK."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but its WAY over priced, I didnt like the crust either (Everyone has a different opinion on crust) 
I got the Large Vegan 17 bucks and it wasnt that big or good.....The Vegan Pizza at Whole Foods is way better and cheaper..
The people and the place itself are very nice......"}
{"text":"recently went vegan and saw this place next to trader joes =) i ordered the very vegan and it is soooo yummy, fast friendly service and great organic food glad they opened up in henderson =)"}
{"text":"So after my initial 3 star rating, I got a message from the owner apologizing for my less than thrilled review and offered a complimentary pie the next time I visited. I took up the offer and tried the BBQ pizza with multi grain crust. OMG. Its awesome! So fresh. So good. I can't give a full 5 star rating because I do think they are a bit pricey for a large organic pizza that feeds 2 Compared to other local organic pizza shops. Nonetheless, the staff is very friendly and the manager's outreach just shows they care about our opinions. Worth at least a lunch visit."}
{"text":"Proof positive that pizza can be a healthy and delicious meal choice as well as an environmentally friendly decision.  However, there is a premium cost for this alternative, and service at this particular location remains in need of some more motivation.

Pizza Fusion boasts a 75% organic menu with many choices for those with restricted diets, including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and dairy-free options.  They also construct and operate their stores in an environmentally responsible manner, ranging from the use of hybrid delivery vehicles and 100% post-consumer recycled delivery boxes to following LEED-certified store construction standards.

We stopped for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and found several other diners had done the same, making it reasonably busy at what I might have expected to be a rather quiet time of the day.  The store is part of a significant amount of business development that popped up around Gibsonia, which lies at the intersection of Route 8 and Route 910 just north of the Butler exit on the PA Turnpike.  So it is a welcome addition to an area that has not offered a lot of differentiated food choices.

We ordered house salads ($4) and bread sticks ($4) w/ olive tapenade ($2) to start.  All were made to order.  So while it took ten minutes to come out of the kitchen, everything was distinctively fresh and delicious.  The organic green mix, tomatoes, sweet red onion, and cucumbers were not overly chilled and generously portioned on large, bamboo plates.  The bread sticks were light and fluffy and just greasy enough to be tasty.  The tapenade was fresh and flavorful, as was the tomato sauce (clearly no sugar added).

We ordered two large specialty pizzas ($23 each, serves 3-4):

The Seattle was a bruschetta-like topping on an organic white flour crust with a light cheese topping.  Very good but probably better as a side dish or an appetizer unless you prefer the fresh taste of tomatoes over a traditional red sauce.

The Prosciutto and Olive pizza was also ordered with organic white crust and is precisely as described.  The prosciutto was very good and sufficiently portioned without being overly meaty.  The downside of this pizza was the use of rather ordinary (and somewhat flavorless) sliced black olives, where a slightly better quality Italian olive might have worked better.

The Pizza Fusion pies are oval shaped, thin crusted, and cut into squares.  The large is a 16-cut (28\" x 9\").  The medium is an 10-cut (18\" x 9\").

Service was friendly and articulate, but overall it lacked promptness.  The ten minute wait for salads was too long, apparently because we were waiting for the breadsticks (which could have come later). And after finishing our meal, it took a while before our check arrived and our leftover items were boxed.  We then had to bring the check to the counter when nobody came back to take our payment.  Overall, the waitstaff needs to pay more attention to what is happening in the dining area and be less involved with what is going on back in the kitchen (where there were at least three people working).

Pricing is the only other area of concern.  While we ordered far more food than needed for three people, a large pizza and appetizers and drinks still would have resulted in a $40-50 check including tip.  Add in beer or wine and dessert and a dinner for three could easily run $75-80 before tip.  Which sadly reinforces the fact that healthy and environmentally conscious food options are still somewhat restricted to those who can afford to make that choice."}
{"text":"Gotta love the whole saving the earth theme, being eco friendly, and a menu variety that has a lot of healthier, organic foods and foods that cater to special dietary needs (gluten, lactose free, vegan, vegetarian)

What's not to love is the price value for your meal and sorry to say ..ugh...the pizza and appetizer I tried. The combinations all sound great, it's just the crust and tomato sauce I wasn't too crazy about.  I tried the Founders Pie that was recommended by the server. The toppings were chicken, kalamata olives, red onions and 4 cheeses(mozz, provo, parm and Gorgonzola) and also tried the Farmers Market one with 3 cheeses (mozz,provo and parm) roasted artichoke hearts, zucchini and portobello. Both times I tasted the pizza I wasn't too thrilled with the sauce on it. It was too thick and pasty, just like the one that comes out of a can. Too much olives made it even saltier tasting and the multigrain crust was too dry and tasteless. The cheeses and veggies were good and that's about it.  
  
Then there's the appetizer I ordered. The zucchini alforno. ..roasted zucchini with vegetarian stuffing, when I asked what was that, my server said it was an olive tapenade. Sound good to me, Iove zucchini and olives so go for it Shirl! When the order was placed on my table, it sure didnt look visually appetizing, not one bit. Took a bite and blech! Zuchinni wasnt roasted enough, still too crunchy and the vegetarian dip was just straight up gross. Too vinegary for my palate I guess. 

On a positive note, the only thing I ordered that I like the first time I tried and came back for and ordered again, is the Pear Gorgonzola salad!   Arugula and Romaine salad greens were cold and crisp, love the candied walnuts and the crunchy sweet pears that topped the salad. The salad was the only winner.
  
Staff was friendly but service was a hit and miss both times. Didn't know if it was seat yourself or wait to be seated. Felt ignored the first time around with the waiter/host not acknowledging my existence for a good minute. When I finally caught his attention he just pointed to a table for me to be waited at.  Took another few minutes till I put in my request for a drink..then order main meal.  My food came out pretty quick.  Second time, around, different staff, I was greeted as soon as walked in the door, and got waited promptly, food came out quick but then my server was MIA  and I had wanted to order another drink but he didnt show up till it was time to present the check, oh well.   

I dont order pizza much anyways when I go to pizza joints but with the mediocore service issues I dont think it's enough for me come back as often as I would like to come to get a salad.   That's too bad, they have a nice concept going."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of about 8 friends, all to eat dinner before going to the Checkers game. We picked this place based on a recommendation from my husband who works in the Metropolitan. For those of you who are unfamiliar, you need to park in the main deck with Best Buy, Marshalls, and Trader Joes and walk outside to Charlottetowne in order to access the front door. 

The ordering system is similar to Jason's Deli or McCalisters, in that you order at a cash register, receive your number and your food is brought out to you. Pizza Fusion's claim to fame is their fresh ingredients, manufactured by sustainable energy, and all around just better for you food. All of their sodas are made from cane sugar. 

I got the personal pepperoni pizza with side salad and a drink. My husband got the same thing and we had a BOGO free coupon from the Entertainment Book. The meals came out rather quick considering our large group (around 10 minutes). The meal itself was the perfect size for 1. A personal pizza is about the size of a medium dinner plate, I think they said 6 inches. The pizza is a thin crust with a good amount of sauce and their \"famous\" pepperonis. Although it wasn't my favorite pizza, it was still good. The service was good, and we got to sit outside and chat."}
{"text":"Pizza is not a rocket science food, so it's difficult to stand out from the crowd. Pizza Fusion is a chain that concentrates on offering organic ingredients and gluten free options. Their commitment at least according to their branding seems to extend to use being aware of their environment impact, using recycled goods, and not just token vegetarian options of vegan choices. They have lots of locally brewed beer choices also.

The counter service is pretty straightforward, a runner will bring your food to you inside or out or you can call ahead and pick up your order. I've mainly alternated between their Farmer's Market or Pear & Gorgonzola pizzas as it's summer and I'm in a lighter food. They'll add meat to any option so don't be afraid to try the vegatarian or vegan options if it tempts you. Servings are a fair size I've split the medium with a friend for lunch or eaten a whole for lunch by myself when I forgot to eat breakfast.

Since the ingredients are unique I'd argue one of the other strengths is actually the location. Yes, the Metropolitian has one of the most passive aggressive inducing parking garage designs in Charlotte. The upside of this is the date ideas you launch from here. Meet here for local brews & noms, then rent b-cycles bike and head to Freedom Park and back. Alternately after a long stroll on the greenway or a game of bocci crash here to refuel before heading out for the night. 

Is it the best pizza ever? Nope. But it it fits in what you need where you need and fills that niche well."}
{"text":"I actually like this place a lot. The portions were generous and the food kept well in a to go container. My girl had a Groupon, so we saved a lot by using that. My gorgonzola and steak pizza was very good and even though I have a hearty appetite, I was only able to eat three slices before throwing in the towel and asking for a box to go."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place if you are on your lunch break.  I work in the Metro building and even when they aren't that busy they are totally disorganized.  They somehow \"forgot\" to make my pizza but managed to make everyone else's that came and went before and after me.  I sat there for my entire 30 minutes waiting on my pizza that I never got.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"Some friends and I wanted to get some pizza after Crepe Shack next door (yes, dessert before dinner) and this place looked awesome.  Really clean interior, great decor, and they served beer.  Woo!

We walked in and the restaurant was mostly empty on a Friday night.  No one was at the host stand so we waited by there and chatted.  When a dirty blonde-haired worker walked by with a beer we asked if they sold pizza by the slice.  He didn't even look in our direction and gave us a condescending, \"No. No, we do not.\"  Um, okay.  We chatted about whether or not to eat for another minute or two and when he walked by us again he didn't even look our way.  Didn't offer us a menu, a seat, anything.

At that point, we decided to bounce.  I would rather my money go towards someplace that doesn't have rude service.  Sucks, too, because I was really interested in trying some vegan pizza and making this a part of my going out rotation."}
{"text":"The four cheese and sundried tomato pizza is as good as the pizza I ate in Italy.  By far the best pizza in town.  I'm getting hungry just writing this review.  My only complaint is that they serve gross tasting organic soft drinks.  Blech!"}

Even if we didnt have a groupon, we all agreed we would have been completely satisfied and will definitely be returning in the future. SO GOOD!!! :)"}
{"text":"Really great pizza and awesome business model. I think they need to get themselves a bit more oriented to conducting business as the service isn't all that great and a little confusing at times."}
{"text":"This place offers an array of pies, including an option for gluten-free. I think the price is reasonable for being all organic and a good size portion for a personal pie. I recommend the Farmers Market. It was flavorful, fresh and filled me up. They messed up on my order of Bruchetta pizza and forgot to add the balsamic vinegar and went overboard on the garlic along with it totally forgotten to be made which is why I'm giving them a 3-star. I would a 3.5 if I had that option. It wasn't crowded/busy and there were about 4 employees working so I didn't understand how my order was missed. Better luck next time!"}
{"text":"Save the earth by eating pizza? Sure! I don't think I would call this pizza, but rather flatbread. I had the Pear & Gorgonzola on multigrain, toasted walnuts, olive oil, mozzarella, provolone and parmesan, it was phenomenal. The different flavors came together perfectly. 

The restaurant itself was IKEA-esque moderate size and empty when I came which surprises me. Don't know if people know about this place, but we need to spread the word! The first Pizza Fusion I tried in San Diego has since closed, so I hope this location has better luck. Large craft beer selection and wine too.

They also offer apps, sandwiches, salads, desserts, gluten free options, and they have a lunch special that runs 11a-4p Mon-Fri, personal cheese or pepperoni pizza and a side salad for $8.00."}
{"text":"I loved there pies.. to bad they closed, did the new one ever get rebuilt?"}
{"text":"Pretty awful.  I guess if you need to be gluten free this is your place but it was a bad experience, and on top of that it was expensive."}

{"text":"Great service and great food!  

My friend saw an ad for this place in a local newspaper and we decided to check it out tonight.  My friend and I ordered the \"Flat bread and Dip Trio\" and \"Bruschetta Pizza.\"  Both were excellent choices!  The service was great, very friendly people!  

Not sure how the other people who wrote reviews left unsatisfied but we LOVED it!"}
{"text":"I revoked my wife's dinner picking privledges after she chose this place. This place is clean and means well with the 'organic' and 'green' stuff but that does not make up for the complete lack of quality and flavor in this food. First, they use Boylan soda products that are beyond disgusting. There is a reason that most places use Coke and Pepsi products. My diet cola tasted like the smell of bandaids.  Second, We got the breadsticks with marinara for an appetizer and they were small, hard and flavorless bread brushed slightly with oil.  Thrid, They didn't write our order down and the stuff on our pizza was wrong. The pizza was decent size and the pepperoni was thickly sliced which was nice. But the sauce was bland and tasted like the sauce from Spaghetti-o's. The crust was burnt, so much so that my wife and I were having little sword fights with our crust pieces.  The staff was super nice and everything but they have some serious issues that will keep us from coming back. This place is was overpriced, but i guess someone has to pay for the Prius and Smart Car delivery cars."}
{"text":"I went to Fusion Pizza to try out a new place. I love how their business and food is environmentally friendly, however I was not impressed by the food though. Quite honestly it was not good at all. I ordered the Greek Pizza and did not enjoy it. Not only that the food is grossly over priced for the amount of food that you get."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! I love the organic, indie, local feel it has. The pizza was very good and they had an awesome beer special. I think we only spent $20 and we had the perfect amount of pizza, tasty seasonal beers and a great time! The guy at the front was very nice and knowledgable about everything. I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"This place has awesome atmosphere with quotes decorated the walls, fun colors and just a real good vibe.  The guy helping us was full of knowledge and took a lot of pride in the establishment and what he was serving.  I liked that!  I had the fusion veggie wrap which had bits of croutons mixed in that made it extra tasty.  My Husband had the pizza which he said was great!!  Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I, with kids in tow tried this just looking for a new place after stopping by the pumpkin patch this evening. Fantastic pizza. We will without a doubt be returning... Pizza is made by the quality ultimately of the ingredients. This place uses high quality organic produce and it makes a huge difference. Nice and clean inside. Good beer selection. Not too big, not too small. Great service. There is nothing to dock them on. We personally ordered the farmers market pizza with a wheat crust. If you like veggies... go for this one."}
{"text":"Finally tried Pizza Fusion yesterday...well, we kinda had to since the Groupon voucher expires today...  So glad I purchased the voucher because the pizzas were delish!

-Appetizer: Stuffed mushrooms - I don't enjoy italian sausage because of the strong fennel seed, but Pizza Fusion got it right.  The mushrooms were stuffed with italian sausage, topped with creamy goat cheese.  The goat cheese cut down the fennel seed taste and it was an awesome combination.  There were a total of six stuffed mushrooms.

-1/2 Fusion House Salad: It's a typical salad...

-Big Kahuna: bacon overload and several pieces of organic pineapple, very yummy.  We got this on original crust.  We both enjoyed this pizza.

-Pear and Gorgonzola:  Winner!  We got this on the multi-grain crust.  There were walnuts on this pizza and this is sooooo  good.

We also got the organic soda, a zero cola and orange cream soda.  The zero cola tasted watered down, no bueno, but the orange cream soda was tasty.

Will we come back...Heck yeah!  True, it's pretty pricey, but lucky for us, we don't eat pizza often.  However, when we do crave for pizza, we will definitely have Pizza Fusion on the top of our list."}
{"text":"The disclaimer is in the name of the restaurant. This isn't the most authentic New York style pizza you've ever eaten, it's \"fusion.\" They offer options that take combinations like pear, Gorgonzola, and candied walnuts and put them on pizza. That said, I didn't find their ready-to-order options that adventurous or novel, but they do have a \"make type own\" column that looked promising. 

I ordered the steak, Gorgonzola, peppers, and onions pizza and the sausage, peppers, onions, and chili flakes pizza. I was hungry and they were tasty, but more like flatbread than what I consider pizza. The steak version, especially tasted more like an open face steak sandwich. 

The one differentiating feature for Pizza Fusion is that they offer choices like organic, gluten free, vegan, and so on. So, if you're going with someone who's on a special diet, they may have options, but if you're not, it's good, but there are better pizzas to be had in Charlotte. 

Overall, if it was a little less pricey, I would throw it in my \"visiting the Metropolitan\" rotation, but at $18-29 for a large (which they call an xl), I could almost just go eat at one of the sit down restaurants around the corner. Maybe if I needed to feed 4 people, it would be more cost effective, but to me, that's just $15 of leftovers."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch.  The pizza was excellent and staff friendly.  I would have given 5 stars however the bathroom was  smelly and the restaurant was hot.  I will return."}
{"text":"I really like the feel of this place, kind of has that new age organic feel but isn't too trendy or take itself too seriously.  So you get the benefit of fresh ingredients that actually taste like they are supposed to without the Birkenstocks and ponchos.  First bonus was that they had Samuel Adams Octoberfest on tap and served nicely chilled.  For my non beer drinker friend they had an excellent Aces Cider.  This isn't your fast food Pizza Hut pizza quickly thrown together with bagged ingredients, for the record i do enjoy stuffed crust pizza.

 We ordered the classic pepperoni, pear and Gorgonzola and the big kahuna.  By far the best pizza was the big kahuna and I'm not normally a Hawaiian pizza kind of guy but this was awesome.  They used generous amounts of bacon on top of all the fresh ingredients including pineapple, red onion with provolone, mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.

The Pepperoni was excellent due to it being real pepperoni and not that greasy cheap stuff you find hanging in the grocery store.  And the surprise of the nigh was the Pear and Gorgonzola pizza.  I'm a meat eater by nature but this was a tasty treat that flowed well together for my tastes.  In a group of six only two weren't too impressed with it and it was due to the Gorgonzola cheese being an acquired taste.  So if your looking to try something new in the pizza world this would be a highly recommended place to visit."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while and a Groupon gave me a good reason to finally try it. We ordered an appetizer, a house salad, and two large pizzas (Groupon deal). The zucchini al forno was different, not sure if I'd order it again, and the house salad was what you'd expect. The pizzas were very good though. The pizza with sausage and peppers was sweet and spicy, a tasty combination. The four cheese pizza was also very good. These were good size pizzas so there were leftovers. The only waiter working was also the host and the runner so service was a bit slow. I would definitely go back for the pizza but I'm hoping they hire more servers."}
{"text":"A quaint and excellent pizza restaurant.  The appetizers were awesome.  The pizza was fantastic.  For a city that I could have eaten lunch anywhere, this place was great.  Mix your pizza; half and half.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was decent, I have eaten here a few times.  My last visit was on Friday!!! Monday morning I drove by and no sign out front, I swung by later that day to investigate.  They are not just closed, BUT GONE everything from the chairs to the oven in back.  The sign says they left because of structural defects in the building. \"Like what the landlord threatend to lock them out.\" No Restaurant just up and vacates unless you owe a lot of money. \"Classy move\""}
{"text":"Pizza as a fast food concept, with a distinctive green and organic feel?  Sounds great, but consistency needs a bit more work at this newly opened business.

I've been in for lunch a number of times now and I can definitively say the service is quick and the wait is never long.  You order at the counter and then your meal is brought table side, while you help yourself to the beverage counter.  Parking is either street-side or in the Met Deck (both hazards worthy of their own review).   Assuming you get in the door, however,  the indoor and outdoor dining space is relatively clean and inviting.

Pizzas come with a choice or white of multi-grain crusts.  They are all generally made in a thin crust style, however.  There are a number of pre-defined combo pizzas and you can always make you own.  Prices are generally in line with other speciality pizza joints about town.  I have found, though, that the pizza is a bit inconsistent in its finish.  Sometimes it is a bit oblong, other times it is round.  Sometimes it is flat as a board, other times it has some nice air pockets in the crust.  Sometimes the crust is a bit more charred on the edges.  These all point to signs that more experience is needed in the kitchen, as you would expect at a brand new franchise.  

Aside from pizza, however, there are a number of salad options with dressings that I find very flavorful.  Dessert pie options are tempting, but just too much at the lunch hour.  I do, however, appreciate the Boylan's soda fountain.  It's fits well with the organic theme and the flavors are great.  Just know that there is no Coke and Pepsi coming from there, but the cola flavor is a nice alternative.

In all, this may not be a place to impress, but it is an acceptable casual eatery option that is a bit more health conscious than most other fast food neighbors.  With quick order to table times and a good number of options to pick from on the menu, it's a fine choice.  Hopefully with time comes a bit more consistency."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great quality, organic and fresh! Perfect meal is one of the salads and personal size pizza!"}
{"text":"I love this place because I can get Vegan pizza and desserts. It's one of the only places in Vegas that I've been able to find animal-free pizza! And I missed pizza!"}
{"text":"We got carryout for this round of pizza noshing and I was thoroughly thrilled with our order! We got two large pizzas and a small side salad for about $35. I can't have gluten and I'm thrilled to have a new go-to pizza place! Try the Pear and Gorgonzola...so delish!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Got a groupon to try them out (2 large pizza, half house salad and an appetizer).

So we ordered half/half on both our pizza. Half Big Kahuna/Half Tuscan Steak & Gorgonzola, Half 4 Cheese & Sun-dried Tomato/Half same but with pepperoni, house salad, stuffed mushroom and for desert the chocolate hazelnut crostata.

Everything tasted delish. 

I will have to say that, if you go here for dinner, make sure you are not \"starving marvin\" or in a pinch for time. This is a small tiny place with about only 3 workers. 2 cooks and 1 main guy as the waiter. The place gets pretty packed and we were there for a total of 2 hrs, half the time waiting on service and our order.  

It is a bit pricey. If I didn't have a groupon, my total after tax and tips would've came out to about $70 but since I had a groupon and I only had $7 extra to pay, after tax & tip I paid a total of $36. Not too bad for all that great yummy food."}
{"text":"Service sucked....I know that they just opened and I will give them a chance to grow and mature but when you are standing there for 8min. and there are just 4 other people in the place and no one tells you \"Go ahead and seat yourself - it kinda sucks. I even made the BF get up at some point to get us some menus....Aye!!!
I mean it's not like they were swamped with customers.....
Alright on to the food : I liked my Bruschetta Pizza - it was full of large roasted garlic and the tomatoes were tangy and not bland at all. The salad was OK - nothing special. The BF had the Farmer's Market Pizza and it was full of veggies and was tasty. My child had the Pepperoni Pizza that she enjoyed as well. I think the pricing is too high for what you get and I'm talking quantity wise. I know that all the ingrediants are organic which makes you feel a whole lot better about eating pizza but $9.00 for a personal pizza is too much in my opinion...
Don't go there starving that's for sure unless your willing to pay....
I guess they do have lunch specials during the week.
They only have organic drinks so remember that their coke is healthy coke - there is a difference in taste - just ask my daughter.
Inside it's decorated OK - there is style thrown in there with lime green chairs and a seperate seating area with relaxing living room furniture and a flat screen T.V. but it is small. 
****Ugh, there are no seat covers in the restrooms- WHY??? - Customers end up having to use alot of toilet tissue to line the toilet seat****

We did enjoy our pizza's so I have no problem saying that I will be back but I'll give them some time to improve on the service. Maybe, they should have a seat yourself sign right when you walk in, Oh and maybe a Get your own menus sign as well....."}
{"text":"I'm hesitant to do 5 stars, only because it seems too good to be true, but my first visit was really lovely. From the pizza, to the price of my wine, to super nice staff (especially the owner, Leigh). 

We ordered a large multigrain crust pizza with bacon (duh), roasted garlic, and spinach. It tasted so very fresh, perfect amount of garlic and spinach. My 8 year old daughter (who can sometimes be finicky) told me it was her new favorite pizza. I ordered a glass of Sonoma Cutrer Chardonnay (very well priced) and Emma had an organic fancy juice, and the total for our bill was $28; a good price (in my opinion) for the quality of food and overall experience. 

They deliver, too, which is good to know for the times you don't want to deal with parking around the Met. 

I just love the entire concept behind the place, too. Good vibes, be good to the earth, good ingredients, good service. Can't wait to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"The food was tasty, and they had Coca-Cola with real sugar in glass bottles. Service was friendly and patient as it was our first time and we ordered a lot of little things with coupons. Would return again."}
{"text":"All right, so my review is a retort to the folks who have complained about minimal toppings, discolored toppings, and burnt crusts. I've been to Pizza Fusion 5 times over the past few months and all on different days of the week.  I have NEVER experienced what those folks are complaining about. I always write a review after I've been to a place many times not just one time because that's not fair. Every restaurant has a bad day and it's my belief that those folks visited on a bad day. The only negative thing I really have to say about the place is yes, the personal flatbread pizza is kind of small for  $9, but it is organic and all the produce is local when possible. You can't really get a pizza with that philosophy anywhere else in Charlotte. So that's why I justify it. Also, the staff are consistently friendly!"}
{"text":"I love organic things so this place is perfect. However most of the things offered are lacking flavor.  I went today with my little girl because she loves pizza.  We got a sausage and pepperoni pizza, I liked the fact that the sausage was local that impressed me. I got a half chicken Caesar salad for organic it was ok. The dressing was super weak but the rest was good. My main complaint is the sodas, I know that it's not into the regular Pepsi or coke products, or even the store brand for that matter. I had the lemon lime which should have been real close to sprite.....well it taste like medicine. It was horrible , the bad thing is that was the best of all the drinks that was offered.  I advise you to bring something to drink with you, or just ask for water (can't go wrong with that right?) all it needs is some flavor, and it will be better."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night and it was packed. We had an excellent dairy-free, gluten-free pineapple pizza - chock full of flavor. My friend also ordered a margarita and while it didn't have the customary salt on the rim of the glass, it did have quite the alcoholic kick to it.

It's a drive, but we will definitely be back. They have a limited delivery area, one I'm hoping will expand. Perhaps a satellite kitchen in Tempe?"}
{"text":"OMG, does any more need to be said about this place???

Vegan, they have two kinds of Vegan Cheese.  Vegetarian, they can accommodate that as well.  Gluten-Free pizza crust, WOW.  Vegan DESERT, YES.

The food is awesome, the people are awesome and if you have not tried this place, you are missing out!!!

Check online, they have nightly specials, you can order online and pick it up, or you can go in and they will treat you like royalty.

We love this place and will go back often."}
{"text":"I've had the pear and gorgonzola personal pizza on multigrain crust. For a meat lover like myself, I wasn't sure this was going to satisfy my hunger, but it did! Good size for one, didn't even finish it. Super tasty, great textures, beautiful contrast. Pizza was perfectly toasted on top as well. 

I've also tried the beet and feta arugula salad and added grilled chicken. Beets were fresh and the salad was filling. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of the most disappointing pizzas I have ever had. They tried to over Foo Foo pizza and the flavors just didn't work for me. I should have known to keep walking when they have a GIANT Blue Moon sign in the window and the server tells us they don't serve Blue Moon... Huh?"}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was tasty but I was the only one there and they made an error  on my order (forgot to add my topping). I went with the four cheese & sundried tomato with added mushrooms.  They did offer to re-make it but I had to be up for a very early flight the next morning and it was already 9pm.

 I thought the quality was good but certainly not exceptional and the size of my personal pizza was a bit underwhelming considering the price. I get that quality ingredients result in a more expensive pizza, but there are a lot of similar pizza places (Intermezzo, Crisp etc.) that offer a high quality pizza (some that are organic/gluten free too) around the same price but you get a much larger personal pizza for your buck. 

I will definitely have to go back and get their $8 cheese pizza special....but with parking being a bit of a pain it will have to be a weekend afternoon."}
{"text":"What are all these people raving about? After a few months of passing by this place on our weekly trips to Target, we finally decided to give it a try last weekend. We were anything but impressed.

I went in with really high hopes for this place since it has so many great reviews. We ordered a large pizza for dine-in, half Farmers Market owing to the server's suggestion and the little heart next to it and half Tuscan Steak and Gorgonzola. When the pizza came, it looked like a joke. For $20, it is a really small pizza. A note to Pizza Fusion: Just because you shape the pizza oblong instead of round and cut it in squares instead of sectors doesn't mean you charge $20 for a pizza which does not even compare to the pizza at other places like Hawthorne, Pizza Peel, Wolfman or Pure Pizza. Yes, I gave you 4 options, visit one and see if you are charging the right price. So everyone says this place is different and has a neat concept. Are they referring to the oblong shape and their \"clean\" delivery vehicles? WTH? That's no reason for this place to be set apart. If that's all I needed, I would make my own pizza at home and shape the dough all kinds of shapes, hearts, triangles...

We decided to sit outside since it was a nice day, but the small tables for two were really crammed in between two big tables as if they were just trying to stuff in tables in tiny spaces just to have a good headcount.

Next, our actual pizza. Maybe they were just having a bad crust day but our pizza was really dry. The Farmers Market, zucchini substituted with caramelized garlic was alright, but there were exactly 3 pieces of garlic on the four slices. Same with the Tuscan Steak and Gorgonzola. Although it had enough pieces of steak on it, they were all crowded on two slices, with one slice having none. It all just looked like everything was put together in a hurry, and they were not even busy.

I doubt we'll ever be back to this place. You can go suck it up, Pizza Fusion and whatever your \"different concept\" might be."}
{"text":"This small franchise is pretty awesome! Plenty of variety in toppings to please the omnis and veggies. Two types of vegan cheese, vegan chick'n and a great flatbread crust. Awesome Boylans soda on tap - so novel and unusual to see out and about it sometimes makes me skip their beer selection (okay fine, just at lunch). 

Even though it's an order at the counter kinda place the service is really great and the owner is really vested in making sure you enjoy your meal. 

It's dangerous this is within walking distance to my office!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here the other day, and it wasn't at all crowded.  That being said, I was a little disappointed with how long they took with our order, but when it arrived it was very tasty, and our waitress was great.  The Boylan sodas are exceptional.
One of our new favorites."}
{"text":"I can't imagine who in the right mind would give this place more then 2 stars . I spent 30 for a steak sandwich and salad and let's just say after one bite it went straight in the trash and I stayed hungry. the steak was not even edible it was rubbery gross. I should have flushed my money down the sink instead of getting food here. if u are looking for decent food Do Not go here. I wouldn't eat it even if it was free. sooooo sad."}
{"text":"Loved Pizza Fusion in Florida, and was so happy to see they opened in Charlotte.

Great pizza, best Ive ever had and love Boylans soda. Def. do the Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad, (also best Ive had)."}
{"text":"-1 star off the bat for customer service when I walked in to get my TAKEOUT order!! It's never a good thing when they are not friendly from the minute you walk in the door.

Aside from that, love their motto. This place offers thin thin crust, so know that from the start!"}
{"text":"We just got back from Pizza Fusion.  We did have a Groupon coupon.  I don't understand why reviewers were so critical of the salad.  Perhaps in the past it was not the same as what we experienced, but it was fine.  It is a house salad with s spring mix of greens, red onion, and tomato.  It was good and large for a half-salad.  The zucchini appetizer was okay.  We would not get it again if we had to pay $7 for it.  

The pizza was very good.  We had the pear and garganazola (sp?) pizza.  That was exceptional.  We loved the multigrain crust.The tuscan beef pie was good, but the other pie was head and shoulders above it.  The service was fine, actually quite friendly.  They were not crowded at all.  The waiter knew a lot about the excellent beer selection that they had.  The wine selection was nice and they had a special of $5 a glass on a few wines.

We will be back.  It's flat-bread pizza so if you're expecting something else, you need to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"For what this place is doing, they are doing a very good job.  I know a lot of people are very particular about their style of pizza whether it be New York or Chicago, thick crust or thin.  Pizza Fusion is doing their own kind of style based on Organic ingredients.  They offer a pretty decent multi-grain crust as well as gluten-free options.  

I purchased the Groupon for this place which was two large pizzas, one appetizer, and half a house salad for $20.  What a deal!  We had the Founders on Multi-Grain and the Steak and Gorgonzola on their regular crust.  I would be very proud of myself if I could make a multi-grain crust like theirs.  It was very good without tasting too grainy.  The Founders was good but it was lacking a little flavor but the olives were a nice touch.  The Steak and Gorgonzola had a lot going on and was very tasty.  The crust was more like a baked pita than pizza crust but again, this is what they're going for, I think.

Overall it was a great eating experience.  Especially for the price we paid.  I never really looked at the prices but was told later that they are around $20 per pizza.  That seems a little steep to me but they run some great specials Mon-Thurs that include free pizzas, 1/2 price drinks, etc.  I would go back with another Groupon but not sure if I would pay full price.  In my opinion, any pizza over $17 is pretty expensive.  However, if you're looking for Organic, Healthier, or Gluten Free options, this might be your place!"}
{"text":"We had, as I'm sure many others did, the groupon.  We ordered a big kahuna and the steak and gorgonzola for our pizzas, and the stuffed mushroom appetizer.  The salad was a typical salad, but the crouton was large, thin and clearly homemade.  It was a nice departure from the super market squares you typically get.  The stuffed mushrooms tasted mostly of sausage, which was the main ingredient.  So, no issues there.

The pizzas were excellent.  The only complaint was my wife thought the big kahuna had \"too much bacon.\"  I told her that's not a thing.  I loved it, but a few more pineapple pieces would have been good.  The steak/gorgonzola was also excellent.  Crispy fresh peppers and a substantial amount of steak.  I could use more cheese, but what dish couldn't use more blue cheese?

This place is not close to us, but it's worth the drive.  We will be back.

Also, the 2 servers I dealt with were fantastic.  Very very friendly."}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza with lots of toppings offered.  Outdoor seating and even Gf brownie, though I wasn't a fan.  Close to the uptown area without the traffic"}
{"text":"I am completely puzzled by the amount of high-star reviews for Pizza Fusion.  I will assume that it is for the dine-in experience rather than delivery and proceed with my review. Moving on...

First of all, the pizza we received looked nothing like the photos provided on Pizza Fusion's Yelp page (so no Yelp...they were not helpful).  I am writing this as the remnants of the Bruschetta Pizza and Fusion Salad still lays strewn in a disappointing, half eaten mess on the kitchen counter.  

The Fusion Salad with the balsamic vinaigrette dressing was actually not too bad.  The \"crostini\" included was as hard as a rock and I may save it to sharpen our kitchen knives with later on this year.  Despite the very efficient online ordering system, they seem to have left off the extra Gorgonzola cheese we requested (for about $54,892.99 extra).  This misstep simply added to the very pleasant experience Pizza Fusion had in store for us once we got to the pizza.

Now, I've been a pizza lover pretty much since birth.  Homemade pizza, frozen pizza, authentic Italian, Chicago Style, Brooklyn Style, and everything in between I've eaten...and most likely loved.  I even secretly partook in the $5 Little Caesar's deal during my college years.  Not to mention, I'm pretty easy to please....until I had Pizza Fusion.  I've never quite experienced a pizza that was actually \"dry\" before...but they managed to pull it off.  The description of the Bruschetta Pizza was ever so tempting...blend of cheeses, fresh basil, diced tomatoes, balsamic vinegar...sounded delicious.  We threw on pepperoni for a little protein and voila! We thought we nailed Perfect Pizza Monday. 

Good Lord in heaven were we wrong.  The \"diced\" tomatoes were an interesting shade of light orange, I will assume they were \"gourmet\".  The additional pepperoni we requested (at an additional $78,898.00) was burnt so badly we assumed they were trying to surprise us with beef jerky.  That's okay. I'm down. I like surprises.  But the combination of the beef jerky and crust that was chewier than hardened Now & Laters just created a combination our jaws could not withstand.  Thankfully my dentist is free tomorrow to pop it back into place after the imminent dislocation. 

The only reason I upgraded my review to 2 stars was due to the online ordering option.  I'm a sucker for that.  I can only hope the dine-in experience is better than delivery.  I must warn you, if you opt for the delivery option you will find yourself longing for the Domino's Pizza Tracker to blink excitedly across your IPad screen as Mike \"carefully prepares your pizza\".  Or you will just end up walking down to the Harris Teeter for a Totino's Party Pizza...either option are far better than the Playschool quality food we had this evening. 

Gross."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre.  I definitely like the \"Green\" attention to detail. If you care more about the environment than the food this is the place for you.

I think the food could be better for the price even though they are paying more for operating in a green manner.  I don't think they love food as much as i do.  

They do have organic beer and wine which was nice to see.  The service was not good, and I have heard much of the same from my friends. 

They need a chef, and better service before I spend 50 on pizza for two."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with this place at all.  Purchased a x-large classic pepperoni pizza and the first thing I noticed when I was handed the box was that it felt like there was nothing in it, the box felt empty. When I got home and actually opened the box I noticed they were very skimpy on the pepperoni which was the only topping. As far as the taste, I've had better from the frozen section at Harris Teeter. 
What I find really annoying about this place is the size of the pizza in relation to the price. Their x-large is comparable to maybe a medium (if that) at other places in Charlotte but costs considerably more as my pizza with one topping came to around $23 with tax.  Not even close to being worth that price, I won't be going back, this place is a joke. I guess you're supposed to feel good about getting ripped off here because apparently by eating at this place you helped save the planet. No thanks."}
{"text":"SO SO SO GOOD!  I have no words to really describe besides that you must try it yourself.  Best Pizza in Charlotte, NC!  And may one of the be the best pizza I have ever had!  The organic ingredients are great, you can tell it's super fresh. They carry local NC beers on tap, and the soda machine has all drinks made with pure came sugar.  I will be here often, that's for sure!  LOVED IT!!!!!"}
{"text":"While put off by the name itself, I decided to eat lunch here with my sister. I don't really know what it is about the name, but it reminds of a place I went to during childhood that I despised. Anyway, the interior is just gorgeous. The furniture, color scheme, and overall vibe is very fun and chic. We were greeted and seated immediately. Everything on the menu sounded delicious, but I ended up with a personal sized plain cheese, pineapple topping, and original crust. It didn't take long for the pie to arrive and when it did, it was beautiful. I finished it in no time and as did my sister with her pizza. We considered ordering another but later decided against it due to other plans in the day. As for the service, our waiter was very attentive and our glasses were never devoid of water. He was willing to answer questions about the menu even though we didn't really have any. He even helped out another patron when they left their to-go boxes inside! I will definitely be back soon, as I forgot to try one of their teas or natural sodas. The children at the table near ours seemed to be really enjoying it."}
{"text":"On a thursday night, we ordered the mini-meatball sliders (7), fusion house salad half (5), and 2 L specialty pizzas, tuscan steak and gorgonzola (21) and big kahuna (19) using the $20 groupon + having to pay an extra 5 + tip. 

- horrible phone service. 1st call, the man who picked up and said bad reception call later, bye and immediately hung up. we called again to ask about their SPECIALTY pizzas are and he said we make everything and started listing toppings. WTF!
- Don't call them on the phone.
- not much seating. 20min wait time for 2. 
- dirty table. not cleaned well. crumbs and toppings all over seats. 
- 3 mini-meat ball sliders, good! crispy yet chewy toast. tasted like ciabatta. small, reason why its called an appetizer.  
- lame salad. \"buy a whole bag at smiths for 3 bucks.\" 
- LARGE pizza for \"you and date\" WTF. more like SMALL.
- well done tuscan steak pieces. very flavorful. :)
- big kahuna was nothing special. a hawaiian style pizza with more bacon. 
- compared to RT pizza, maui zaui is way better.  PF is not the best pizza i ever tasted.
- not interested in a \"healthy pizza\". nice concept tho. i'm sure the bandwagoners jumped on it. i prefer the greasy pan pizza :).
- organic garlic salt!!! :) cooooool
- READ THE FINE PRINT! the GROUPON is valued up to $48! you will pay more unless you get a boring pizza. 
- overall, lame service, pretty good pizza (only with the groupon) and nice that proceeds to go share our strength."}
{"text":"What enticed me was that this new place used organic and natural ingredients - In trying to eat healthier, we wanted to give it a try.  Nice place - they have a nice wine selection as well. Staff was awesome - George was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu - and he's a comedian too!! We started with the Flatbread and dip trio - which was yummy! I t came wit an fresh artichoke spread, olive tapenade and a marinara sauce.  We ran out of the flatbread pretty quickly, and without even having to ask - George brought more!  The mini meatball slliders were also very good - enough for a meal with a side salad.  The drinks are all natural as well. And now for the pizza... so many varieties - we had the tuscan Steak and Gorgonzola pizza on whole grain crust - .DELICIOUS!! The presentation was a nice touch.  We will definitely be going back to try their sandwiches and organic brownie!!!"}
{"text":"I am here and ready to save the Earth, one pizza at a time. That is their motto which hangs over the bar. The word on the streets before they open did not amp up my excitement to try this place, but one visit changed all that. 

I went in expecting to not be impressed and walked out highly pleased. I am not sure where this establishment won me over, but they did. The onslaught of friendly faces and warm greetings was a start. My party of two was told that we could sit anywhere, which included the lounge area in front of the bar. This helped to lower my guard. George, our personable waiter, sat down to explain the menu to us. Way to disarm my barbed defenses. The suggestion of a pizza I was eyeing down gained my trust. An option for multigrain pizza crust got me to loosen up. The string of 80's classics came on and I could not resist the charms of Pizza Fusion any longer. I lost my shit when Don Henley came on. Then my Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza came out and my inner paparazzi swarmed. This pita style crust is not what I had expected, but it was still good. The sweetness of the pears and candied walnuts balanced out the saltiness of the cheese. The sesames laced throughout the crust was an indication that they were not bullshitting me with this multigrain claim. How dare they stay true to their word. 

I was beginning to wonder what a \"glutton\" free, vegan, vegetarian and eco friendly pizza joint would serve. Within an hour, they proved that dietary restrictions and eating out are not exclusive separate. All of the vegetables are organic as well. They do serve meat for all the carnivorous yelpers out there. The only complaint I have is that they send their dough through a press and it is not hand tossed. If that is the worst complaint I can come up with, it is still a victory. Next time I will go all out and get the gluten free vegan pizza. Baby steps until then."}
{"text":"Ive been twice and have had the peporoni both times.  I just love it and the fack that it is non cured which is much healthier.  I tried it with both crusts and dont like the wheat as much.  Really like the people and think the price is right for the quality.  We eat way to much pizza so a healthier pie like this is aesome for our family."}
{"text":"Would've gave 4 stars but the service here was horrible.  We came on a Monday night (not busy).  We ordered a lg pep pizza, small eggplant pizza and Caesar salad.  This place doesn't have soda machines so just bottled drinks (no refills). Our total came to $37.00 -- I noticed other tables had a groupon, that would have been better but oh well we didn't have one.  Food was good but the waiter guy was just such a moody....well yeah. Anyway, doubt we will be back as we really were just trying to find a place to have dinner since we were having a crepe from next door for dessert."}
{"text":"First time here, had bought a deal 20$ for $10 and finally used it. Friend had the small steak salad and loved it, had enough for lunch the next day. I ordered the medium margaerhita pizza and it came out flat bread style.. nice and crispy with huge chunks of yummy roasted garlic. For a medium the size was small... one person could eat alone, if sharing would need a side or salad to start... ingrediants fresh and flavors wonderful. They are a little more pricey but its because of the freshness... they do have deals for pizzas/drinks etc so you could order for a larger crowd and get a good deal."}
{"text":"The horrific experience that I had here a few months ago popped into my head, so I figured that I'd write a quick review. I'm happy to see that it had closed because i would NEVER have gone back.  It wasn't that the pizza was mediocre, it was that it was just plain bad.  So much so that i threw out an entire large pizza after eating just one slice.  Major disappointment."}
{"text":"My husband and I were quite happy to find a place that serves a delicious gluten-free pizza. Most places use some sort of frozen rice crust that I can buy myself. Pizza fusion actually makes their own gf crust-- go figure!

We shared a pepperoni pie, and even my gluten-tolerant husband liked it! Normally, he grins and bears it for my sake. Good beer selection and they had sports on the television-- two must for us when it comes to pizza.

Even in you aren't gluten intolerant, this place is a great choice.  In fact, I a, headin over there right now to grab some dinner."}
{"text":"If there was a minus star I would pick that. The wait staff was beyond rude and unfriendly. Yes that's you Brandon . Defiantly need to get have someone work there that wants to be there. I'm sure you can find someone who would like to have a job. I would not waste my money here if I were you. Food definitely not worth the Hype. I wish I would have saw some of the reviews before I went. Pizza was hardly even warm when we finally go it and the place was not even buys so there was no reason for my food to have sat there so long. Needless to say I will be sticking with Another pizza place on Eastern before serene Grimaldis Pizzeria. ALWAYS Friendly And Helpful and way better food."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to get here, so after Target I decided to check it out. Upon arrival I was the only customer, and was even when I left. The service was very slow, but I like the options available. I ordered the individual pizza with chicken and peppers and a Caesar salad. The pizza toppings were great, but the sauce was very disappointing, reminded me of Ragu. As for the salad, it was not a Caesar salad in my mind, they served the dressing on the side, which I like, but very watered down with no real Caesar flavor. Overall, OK, but I definitely have had better."}
{"text":"Being vegan and in Las Vegas the choices are minimal when it comes to pizza(other than Sammy's Woodire, there is nothing else really)..when I heard about this place opening last month I finally found time to make the trek to Anthem (where they are located in the strip mall next to Trader Joes,k--mart ,etc)

When I arrived I was a little skeptical, as it appears small, in comparison to most places or chains, but there is signs posted all on the windows such as \"eco this\" \"eco that\", \"organic\",etc,etc - so I figured this sounds right up my alley of what I was hoping it would be


When we arrived there was only one other table with two women having lunch, we placed our order and then  suddenly the place got slammed busy, all tables were full, and i seen a couple guys actually turning away because there was no table -and since the place is quite small (only a handful of tables), the lone waitress could not bring the food out as fast as it was ready. Our food(and all other people's)sat for a good five minutes or more before she served it to us ( by the way I am not blaming her ..she was too busy and they were grossly under staffed)

To boot it was 103 degrees and the air conditioner was not working, so she was spending lots of time(unsuccessfully) trying to get it up and running, we were sitting by the thermostat and it read 82 and climbing by the minute.

For Vegans the menu has the option to sub the real cheese out for soy cheese or Daiya cheese.

I chose the soy cheese, while my wife took the Daiya since she loves that stuff, (me i find it a bit tangy normally) so i figured i would try this soy cheese option. 

My pizza was very good, i am a big pizza sauce fan, and in my opinion can make or break a pizza-this had good sauce, perhaps too much for the average person, but i usually ask for extra anyways so that was fine for me, the crust was great(they do have a multi grain crust as well which i did no try)and i did eat my whole pizza so that is a good sign there.

They also have as a topping , a gardein chicken which is unheard of  to find at a pizza place, but it gives vegans an option besides just mushroom, black olive,and the other staples we are usually stuck with. I did try the gardein chicken, but probably would not the next time as its a bit too close to the real thing for my liking, and when i was not vegan i never did like chicken on my pizza in the first place.

In conclusion the pizza was good, but I do not think I would drive a half hour to get it weekly, however, if you live in the area you may want to check it out for sure

For desert  one of the options was a vegan home made brownie which was quite  good also, it was two triangle brownies for 4.00 which i thought was a good buy.
They also have some orangic sodas, ice teas, which i did not try personally.

For you non vegans, this review was biased mainly towards vegans so i apologize but i am sure you will like it just fine."}
{"text":"Got the pepperoni pizza, and it was great.  Enjoyed it the next day, too.  I am looking forward to trying some of their more unique pizzas, but I wanted to get a feel for how they handled the simplest type.

Manager and staff were nice. (huge part of how I rate places...)

Also, feels good to eat for the betterment of the planet....."}
{"text":"Well..... I've been wanting to try this place for a while now.  Went today with the fam and its in a really nice location.  Staff was friendly and helpful with the menu.  Restaurant is small inside but has seating outside as well.  
I liked the decoration with inspirational quotes about taking care of our planet.  
I loved the fact that this place uses all organic ingredients and local produce whenever possible.  
Vegan friendly items on the menu are a plus and the fact that they provide the choice of two different vegan cheeses is a humongous plus (for those avoiding soy).  
Fountain drinks (sodas) are all natural, pure cane sugar.  I don't drink soda but I was happy that my hubby and daughter could enjoy their drinks without the chemicals.
Pizza was OK.  Nothing out of this world.  I was expecting more in execution and flavor.  The toppings were scarce.  I had the very vegan with added onions and I swear my personal pizza only had about 1 mushroom sliced and a few scant slices of onions.  I couldn't taste the tomato sauce.  Most of what I tasted was the crust which was just OK.  Honestly, I have made the same pizza at home and it tasted a bit better. 
My daughter had the classic cheese and my hubby had the sausage and 3 pepper and they were not thrilled.  I was disappointed.  I've been to 2 other similar pizza places who serve way better flavors.  I really wish this place was amazing because I prefer to eat organic.
The prices are not terrible considering that you're paying for organic ingredients which are not cheap.  With that in mind, I thought prices were reasonable.  
I would have given this 2 stars based on execution but because they claim to use organic I have to support that and add the extra star.
I plan on visiting again and giving this place another chance.  Hopefully the flavors will improve."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  So sad it shut down!! :("}
{"text":"I agree with another reviewer that it is a well intentioned concept.  Decor and atmosphere was, clean, comfortable and inviting.  Service wasn't great, but was OK.  If the food was better I would plan a return trip, but it was unfortunately not good.

We are gluten free family so we were excited to hear that they had many GF options for us.  Ordered the Vegetarian Antipasto, Flat bread Trio, Chicken Caesar Salad, and 2 pizzas.  All GF versions.  It was disappointing.  GF crust and flat bread was hard and tasteless.  My GF homemade pizza crust and packaged versions I get from Whole Foods were 100 times better.  Sauce on the pizza was too sweet.  The salad was drowning in dressing, Antipasto was also tasteless,  Flat bread was not good and the dips were mediocre.  

So bummed that it wasn't better.  Hoping to check back in on Yelp and see and improvement and maybe we'll give it another shot.  Would really like to see more \"healthy\" and organic restaurants in Henderson."}
{"text":"This pizza joint was smaller than I expected, but packed plenty of punch in the taste department.  Service was friendly and efficient.  Availability of alternative dough for your pizza flatbread was nice (options: traditional, multigrain and gluten-free).

Founder's Pie:  Free range chicken, kalamata olives, roasted red onion, tomato sauce, parmesan, mozzarella, provolone and gorgonzola.  It has a good combination of ingredients, and is highly recommended.

Tuscan Steak and Gorgonzola: Steak, gorgonzola, tri-color peppers, roasted red onions, parsley, tomato sauce, mozzarella, provalone and parmesan.  This was okay, the beef on the pizza does not resemble those on the photo on the web site, and is more than cooked.  Otherwise, the flavors are good.

Appetizer:  Tried the Stuffed Mushrooms. Each order comes with six, and is a delicious treat for your mouth.

Decor: 4/5  It does reminds me of IKEA plastic furnitures.  

Food:  4.5/5  Good flavor profiles on the pizzas we ordered.

Service:  4.5/5  No complaint here.

Parking:  4/5  Plentiful.

Price:  3.5/5  A wee on the $$ side, but you get what you pay for in terms of yumminess."}
{"text":"They have a well-intentioned concept which I appreciate, but it wasn't as good as I had hoped. 

I purchased the Groupon for Pizza Fusion recently and decided to come here with my fella on Sunday for lunch. We started with a salad and meatball sliders. We had our hearts set on stuffed mushrooms, but they were out. The salad was pretty sad. The lettuce was dry and the toppings were sparse. The dressing that came on the side was ok, but on this rare occasion, I wish the dressing came on top of the salad, so that it could have absorbed the flavors a little better. The meatball sliders were ok. The bread was a bit dry, but I enjoyed the meatballs and the tomato sauce, so ate the filling out of the sandwiches.

For our entrees, I ordered the founder's special pizza and my fella settled on the tuscan steak and gorgonzola pizza. When the pizzas came out, I felt really overwhelmed. They were ENORMOUS! I was only able to eat about one slice before getting full. My fella only had about three and was done. That left about 1 3/4 pizzas left to take home with us. The steak and gorgonzola was pretty good. The meat was a little dry, but the pizza had good flavors and I really enjoy their tomato sauce. It has a sweeter taste than most pizza places, but it was nice. My pizza was a little heavy on the kalamata olives. I'm usually a big fan of olives, but all the flavors were overwhelmed with olive that I couldn't really enjoy anything else about the pizza. The chicken was a bit dry as well. If I came back, I'd avoid the olives. Actually, the pizzas tasted a lot more moist and flavorful after letting them sit in their to go boxes for a little bit, weirdly.

All in all, we had a good dining experience and next time I'll be prepared for leftovers or bring some friends to share with me next time!"}
