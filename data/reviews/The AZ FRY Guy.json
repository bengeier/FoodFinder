{"text":"Just had lunch here with my wife! I ordered the Shrimp Po-boy and my wife ordered the catfish lunch specials! They were both delicious! The sweet tea is awesome and even the water is good (No nasty after taste)!!! We also got the peach cobbler which was very delicious. Over heard another customer rave about the fried chicken, going to try that next! 
New favorite restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here.  The staff was friendly, the food was delicious, and the price is right!  Now that's a trifecta!  I'll be back for sure.  God Bless the cook because you put your foot in all the food.  :)"}
{"text":"Had an absolutely epic soul food feast consisting of the catfish dinner (fried hard), fried shrimp, fried chicken breast, wings, greens, mac and cheese, and cherry cobbler. Every bite of each dish proved a revelation, this wasn't just good food, this was mind-blowing great food that hit every right note.

Fantastic service and friendly faces made the dinner all the more memorable. An absolute gem well worth seeking out."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!  Their family recipes and home style cooking make for a food euphoria not easily forgotten, my mouth is watering right now as I think about the delicious meal I had there.  The food came out fast, super hot, and unbelievably fresh.  I had the chicken fingers, mac and cheese, and collard greens all of which were scrumptious, I kept burning my tongue but could not control my self from inhaling this meal.  Keep doing what you do AZ Fry Guy, you provide the epitome of a delicious home cooked meal."}
{"text":"This place is great best fish i ever had been there two days in a row and today was giving two free pork chops staff was great"}
{"text":"Best place in town for \"Soul Food\". I had a great experience. The food and service was superb. I ordered Catfish Nuggets, BBQ Ribs and Links, Mac 'n' Cheese, Yams, and of course, Banana Pudding. I would recommend to anyone. I wish I new about this place sooner."}
{"text":"Don't see many of these shops in Avondale. Sad to say that it was very salty and price point is high for the quality of the food. Had better."}
{"text":"I had fried catfish, Mac and cheese, fries, and some banana pudding. The catfish and banana pudding were very good, but the mac and cheese and fries were pretty average. I like cheese mac and cheese, and there wasn't much cheese to be found. If I went again I'd probably just get fish."}
{"text":"It was so good!! I had the 2 piece catfish with greens and yams and the Mr. had the same only difference is he had Mac n cheese with his... I was so impressed with how the place itself looked and the greeter/hostess was so sweet!! Took great care of us even though we carried out! It was our first but definitely not our last visit!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for someplace good to get a quick food order to go since we were traveling back home and didn't have time to eat right then and there. We were at the Wal-Mart off of Dysart and a quick search showed this place right across the street. Checked out their online menu and reviews and it looked good so we decided to check it out. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and the young lady at the counter (didn't get her name, doh!) was super friendly and thoroughly explained the menu. I'm a sucker for pork chops and one of the specials was the pork chop dinner so that made my choice super easy. Each dinner comes with 2 decent size sides, I got mac & cheese and potato salad. My wife went with the chicken strip dinner and her sides were mac & cheese and cole slaw. The dinners also come with a dinner roll or for 50 cents more you can opt for a cornbread muffin. With no hesitation we went with the muffins. For dessert they have banana pudding and peach cobbler, we each went with the pudding since my wife said she wasn't go to share hers with me :-( The girl at the counter rang us up and about 15 mins later our food was ready. Yes the wait seemed like a long time but I was hoping that meant the food was going to be extra good... well I would have to wait 2 hours until we got home. It was torture driving that long with the smell of freshly made pork chops and fried chicken in the car! The verdict: THE WAIT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT! I opened my container and there were 2 good sized pork chops seasoned and cooked perfectly. Pork chops can be very dry if not cooked right but these were juicy and the seasoning had a slight hint of heat to it which I enjoyed. The mac and cheese was good the only thing I would suggest is adding bacon to it and the potato salad was fresh and tasted sweet. I grew up eating tangy potato salad so usually I'm not a fan of sweet but this was really good and not overly sweet. The muffin was good but I'm spoiled because my drizzles honey onto her cornbread before she bakes it but I still had no problem devouring this muffin. My wife said her strips were tasty as well as her sides. Oh and I almost forgot, the banana pudding was AMAZING! So to sum it up this place makes some super tasty soul food for a decent price and the people there are the friendliest you'll find anywhere. Go check it out, your stomach will thank you for it!"}
{"text":"Best place ever I bought a 3 piece wing with greens and mac n cheese added a piece of catfish for 1$ I love so much my best friend and I made this our lunch spot every Wednesdays. Much love to the amazing cashier and the cook they have AMAZING spirits.  love Kenan & Kel"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot

You can't go wrong eating here I suggest if you haven't ate here yet you are missing out.....oh yea the pork chops are bomb to"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Food is cooked to order so be patient...it is really worth the wait. Highly recommend the fried chicken, catfish, mac-n-cheese, greens & fries. The portions are large so you get your money's worth. Sides are large enough to share as well. Looking forward to coming back...we'll save room for dessert next time...anxious to try the banana pudding!!! Come out and support this local mom/pop shop. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Me and my extremely picky family ate here tonight and the food was DELICIOUS .  We had fried catfish (nicely battered and large pieces), chicken tenders (biggest tenders I've ever seen), rib tips, ribs, hot links, mac n cheese, greens and fries (a basket filled to the rim).  We had a lot of food for  reasonable price.  I am sitting her stuffed as I write this.

The service was great. We came in 45 minutes before closing and the lady working in the front was so friendly and didn't try to rush us.  The restaraunt was very clean.

We would definitely eat here agai."}
{"text":"I'm from Alabama and don't get to eat southern food often. I stopped at The AZ Fry Guy and had an amazing lunch! Could have made a meal off of the greens and cornbread!! Catfish and chicken were also amazing.  Service was great. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Food is good enough. 50 minute wait for my order is ridiculous. Maybe had to chase pig for a while. Before the fry."}
{"text":"Az fry guy was the worse fried chicken restaurant I've been to dry over cooked chicken, tasteless Mac and cheese, they forgot the roll, raisins in the coleslaw, I will never waste my money there again."}
{"text":"Any spot that keeps you going in daily for a \"fix\" is worthy of 5 stars.  There are not many places in AZ offering authentic soulful dishes. However, AZ Fry Guy hits the nail on the head with food that has me going back for more.  As a recent transplant to AZ, it is natural to compare the restaurant offerings with \"home\" and  I have been disappointed in the lack of diversity in what is offered.  However, once I discovered that AZ Fry Guy has all that I need to satisfy my cravings, I am hooked.  

His greens....oh, those greens, are the best I had in a long time. I say that because my mothers are bar none the GOAT, however, AZ Fry Guys greens are addictive.  No, literally my addiction. Who would have known that at any point in my life I would crave greens. I have been trying to figure out his ingredient every time I taste them but I am unable to crack the case.  I no longer see a point in even making greens at home when AZ F.G. is 10 minutes away. 

Last night I had the mac and cheese and peach cobbler for the first time.  The mac and cheese was not was I expected....it was BETTER.  It was cheesy and everything that I dream about in a mac and cheese.  From the cheese to the flavoring, nothing was missing.  I am adding this to my usual greens order.   The peach cobbler also exceeded expectations. Once I got my order in the car, I tasted one bite and drove straight to the store to grab ice cream. It was so good that I knew I needed ice cream to thoroughly enjoy the entire peach cobbler experience.  Everyone seems to like their cobbler different.  Who cares what the \"right\" way is (soupy or naw)...this one was just the way I like it. 

Don't think that you can order and just share 1 order. While the quantities certainly would allow you to, the flavors will not. You will not want to give up one bite. 

Bravo, AZ FG, clearly, I will be back"}
{"text":"Just had fried catfish, greens, mac & cheese. All of it was delicious & home made. This is my soul food spot now. No need to drive to Phoenix. Food was hot, tasty & well served. Owners & staff nice & friendly. Must come by & have their home made banana pudding. Absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"All I can say is Yum.  Great fried chicken, tasty greens.  Exceptionally friendly service.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Amazing homemade cooking.. fresh,  delicious southern cooking.. the banana pudding is amazing just found his mama makes it so you know is good."}
{"text":"incredible Mac and cheese, the chicken is lightly breaded...really nice staff. would have missed it driving by but so glad we stopped in"}
{"text":"Tried it for the 1st time with me and my friends and it was great. The service was nice!!  I got the rib tips with the greens and Mac and cheese and I tried the peach cobbler - and was delicious!!!  Would def recommend you trying. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"We had excellent ribs to go. Though  a whole slab was not on the menu, we ordered them a day ahead. They were big and meaty with great flavor. My husband said he liked the smoked ham/bacon flavor. The sauce was excellent too. We had more than enough for four servings. They were so helpful and friendly. They called us the next day to see how we liked them.   We will definitely return and try some other items. My husband is a huge rib fan so our order will always include ribs."}
{"text":"My supervisor and I have been searching for some of the best fried chicken in the valley and let me just say this place was it. Greg behind the counter was phenomenal and provided outstanding customer service. For me, service comes first before anything. He was short staff, however, he went beyond to ensure we were fed. The fried chicken is seasoned like no other. The Mac-n-cheese was cheesy. The greens, flavorful. And the wings, done! Highly recommend anyone to go here. My go to spot for fried chicken was Lolo's but I'll be coming here instead. Hello AZ Fry Guy!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best soul food restaurant in Arizona!!!  The Ribs, Hot Links, Mac n Cheese and Greens were AMAAAZZZING! Great portions, excellent customer service!  A must go to place for good food!!!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp and all of the great reviews so I wanted to give it a try.  

I had the catfish po'boy with mac n cheese.  It was very tasty and the fish was nicely crisp.  Loved the special sauce and the roll.  The cornmeal coating was just the right amount with great flavor.  I also tried a couple of the shrimp and they were like wise tasty and cooked just right.

I will be going back for sure.  Thanks for the great lunch!!

Oh on a side note, the entire place was very clean and has one of the nicest public restrooms!"}
{"text":"The Fry Guy is a must have. The food was Delish! I finally found my new craving and its in the west side. Thank for the  flavorful food and outstanding service. You definitely have the magic pallet!"}
{"text":"I took my niece here for dinner, this is the second time we have been here and we will definitely continue coming back. The fried chicken is so tender and juicy! My niece LOVED their Mac n cheese. I am not an expert on greens but these are so tasty! I love them! My niece had 3 chicken fingers and they are huge! She was glad she didn't get the 5 piece as it would have been to much food. Everyone that works there that I have encountered have been so nice. The only negative that I found was the cornbread. I have definitely had better but hey I can deal with mediocre corn bread when everything else is so good!"}
{"text":"Needed some comfort food on my birthday and I have to say I was extremely satisfied!! Had the chicken breast and wing with greens and mac n cheese!! Mmmmmmm!!! Happy, Happy girl! My husband had the catfish po boy and was in heaven! Large portions cooked to Perfection!  
Went back today with my picky parents and my Dad had the pork chop special and fell in love! My Mom had the catfish special and said it was the best she has had in AZ! I got the chicken and wing again with a piece of catfish on the side with potato salad and greens. Once again I was extremely satisfied! My hubby called while I was there and said to make sure and bring some home!!  Took a to go order of pork chops, rice and beans and banana pudding for my hubbys dinner! 
The thing is this is like the  comfort soul food that  I grew up on! Flavors are on point! Can't wait to try their BBQ rib specials on the weekend!!
Funny thing is my brother showed up with his family while we were there! They didn't know we were going to be there!!   We all have good taste!!!

Update.  Heating up the food I brought home for the hubby and I can't stop picking at it!!! Damn!! This food is gonna make me fat!! Can't stop!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. I tried calling to place a to go order but the phone was busy. They called me right back and were very helpful. I arrived 10 minutes after placing my order and barely had to wait. We got the chicken, potatoe salad and Mac and cheese. Everything was delicious and we'll priced. Seriously considering going back for dinner. Is twice in one day too much?"}
{"text":"Is there a way to give more than 5 stars? Oh my gosh. This is hands down the best soul food restaurant anyone could ever go to. Fair prices, good portions, and great food. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who's craving some good soul food. Definitely bringing all my friends and family anytime they visit. The greens are very well seasoned and tender to the point of perfection. The chicken was seasoned and fried so perfectly it came right off the bone. I could go on forever raving about the place. But you'll see when you go for yourself"}
{"text":"First time here but definitely not the last. The greens! The greens! The greens! The mac is delicious! The fish is delicious! I've been waiting for a soul food restaurant to come to this area. This is authentic soul food and the best greens I've had at a soul food restaurant in the Phoenix area. Friendly management and very clean restaurant. I highly recommend to anyone in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! The fried tilapia was perfect.  Not greasy, but crispy and seasoned just right.  The rib tips were brushed with just enough sauce to not overwhelm the tasty flavor of the meat. The greens are simply amazing, wish I would have got another order.  The mac and cheese was average, but all in all the food and  friendly staff made this an enjoyable experience. Would definitely be back..."}
{"text":"Good southern soul food! Real mac n cheese.... best greens I've have in AZ hands down!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem!  Food is fresh, hot and delicious!  Staff is very friendly.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Was ok but nothing special. I had chicken wings, mac and cheese and greens. Wings had good flavor but they were very tough. The mac and cheese and greens were good but not spectacular by any means.

My wife had the catfish (she loves catfish) but said it had a strong flavor and said it wasn't the best.

Sweet tea was good and portions were huge. I'd go back for the flavor of the wings and try different sides."}
{"text":"So glad to find good soul food in Arizona! I could come here for the greens alone to be honest. I only wish they were open more often and I actually got a roll when I buy the dinner plate!"}
{"text":"Been knowing this big head fool for damn near 20 yrs so I had to stop by and check him out. Plus he would have literally killed me if I didn't stop by. So I ordered pork chops, wings, greens and mac & cheese. The coating on the chops and chicken was excellent! Just enough to add a nice crispness. Very flavorful and juicy. Mac was nice and cheesy like it should be. Green were really flavorful and they even give you some of the pot liquor which I like. Now that peach cobbler is something else. Saved that for the next day so I can add some ice cream with it, which it didn't need I was just being a fatty. If you're ever in town or even if you're not stop by and check them out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm known as the chicken strip man lol great service great food. Best spot to go to in the West valley. Prices are fare, I'm always coming back!"}
{"text":"We went when it was first opened and it was good food, but very expensive. I ordered the catfish and the pieces were tiny for the price. Haven't been back since."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite wanting to try something new and let me state that no matter what I write I can't give this place enough credit. The food is on point, was able to try a little bit of everything with the misses and left completely satisfied. Let me say where this place shines which is their fried fish. Thin light breading that hits the spot every bite. However, their chicken breast in my opinion is the jewel of this fine establishment and words can't do it justice. If you like the taste of home cooking with no compromise and love chicken you have to put this on top of any list. If you are anywhere near the West valley and don't don't give this place a visit your doing yourself a disservice. 

Disclaimer: Some might think I'm completely full of it or something along those lines which is fine because it's your opinion and all I have to say is that this place is too damn good to reference it any other way."}
{"text":"The chicken is always cooked to order hot n ready. Sides are great and hospitality is great."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here, and we had a very enjoyable lunch.  My husband and I shared the shrimp lunch and chicken tenders, and I had mac 'n cheese and he had potato salad to go along side.  The mac 'n cheese was probably the best I've ever had - it puts my favorite recipe to shame!  The shrimp was also outstanding, but maybe for the price there should be a bit bigger serving.  The chicken tenders were cooked very nicely, but were highly seasoned with some sort of hot sauce that wasn't what we were expecting.  Bob said the potato salad was also good - obviously house made.

The one downfall I could mention is being changed in the next few months, according to the owner, who we met as we were leaving.  We arrived for lunch a little before 1 pm on a Wednesday, and there were no other patrons eating lunch or picking up to-go orders.  It's always a little off-putting being the only ones in a restaurant - you wonder if everybody else knows something you don't!  The owner said he was moving the business to a different location in a few months, as this particular location wasn't bringing in customers.

I hope the new location works out for this business, as the food is top quality, and you can tell he really cares about putting out a good product."}
{"text":"Everything was superior.  My wife got 5 shrimp and chicken tenders. I got the special - 2 catfish filets (crispy) and 3 shrimp.  We both got the same sides - greens and Mac & cheese.

The shrimp were breaded lightly with some cornmeal in the mix.  They were good-sized, juicy and the freshness came through.  Excellent.

The catfish were also lightly breaded.  I had a choice of crispy or non-crispy.  I chose crispy.  The catfish was tender, juicy and flavorful.  This was the best catfish I have ever eaten.

I usually prefer dark meat chicken because it is tastier and juicier than white meat.  This place changed my mind. He goes very light on the breading and has found some magic (probably the heat of the oil) that seared the outside while keeping the inside juicy. Not greasy at all.  You cannot find better chicken anywhere. No wonder he has won awards and acclaim for his chicken.

I am used to restaurants serving \"stuff\" in their otherwise bland Mac & cheese.  So I asked what he adds to his.  He said \"nothing\".  He had no need to.  Rich, cheesy, sharp. Great side and a large portion too.

As great as everything was, a side dish stole the show. The greens are a 12 on a scale of 1 to 10.  My wife asked if the meat chunks were ham hocks and he said that he cooks his greens with smoked turkey.  He must be very picky about the greens he uses and the smoky taste of the turkey because the combination just explodes flavor in every bite.  Again, the portion was large and I could have eaten 2 or 3 of them.

The chef told me that he is from Los Angeles and had a food truck there for a few years.  I asked him where an LA guy learned to cook such fantastic soul food.  He told me he learned from his mom.

Well, thanks mom.  Your son serves the best soul food in Arizona."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.   I ordered fried chicken with sides.   The food was seasoned perfectly.  My husband ordered cat fish.   It was so flaky and delicious.   And the homemade tartar was excellent.   We were recently in Atlanta and this food was just as good if not better.   Great soul food experience.  Oh and the sweet tea was on point."}
{"text":"Great food and great hospitality. Catfish was really good. Chicken strips where juice."}
{"text":"This is amazing!!! I ordered the greens and the macaroni and cheese. I would have to say I am super picky with my food because my dad and family are excellent cooks. I am addicted to the greens had them 3 days in a row and the macaroni and cheese was super good as well! I will definitely go there and eat especially with my new addiction to the greens! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Largest chicken tenders I have ever seen.  I'm afraid to see the Brahma chicken they came from.  They were okay, cooked well but truly nothing special.  Mac n cheese was forgettable and fries were well seasoned and okay.  Called order in for pickup and girl seemed clueless.  Told us they were out of desserts and food would be ready in 20 min.  We should up in 20 min and still waited 20 min and they were not out of desserts.  Too many options in area to try again.  If you dig on huge brandish well cooked chicken tenders jump on this place"}
{"text":"Looking for a place for some great catfish that doesn't have more batter than fish? This is the place to be. It's clean, friendly, and the taste buds loved it. The place is simple but with many options. I told the cook \"I don't like greens but these are really good\". I mean they're gooooood, which is an understatement to describe the deliciousness of the greens. Clean and stem free. Mac and cheese is actually mac and cheese. None of that Kraft stuff. The potato salad, man, it's something else (in a good way). Then comes the banana pudding. DE-LI-CIOUS! Wash all that down with some of their Kool-Aid and you'll be a-okay! Finally, a soul food restaurant in Avondale."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place! It's absolutely delicious great service and food every time I visit!!"}
{"text":"It's taken me a year to get here,  and it was worth the wait! Food is full of flavor!! Well seasoned (and not just salt), comes out hot and the portions are above average! Catfish fresh,  black eyed peas taste as if they were just finished cooking, greens tender and not full of stems and the sweet potatoes- perfectly sweet! I will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! My wife had the shrimp, I had the wings. Fantastic food, excellent Mac and Cheese and greens. Really enjoyed everything!"}
{"text":"Had catfish fried just right, fried shrimp,greens,mac n cheese all delicious.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We live 4 hours away and every time we are in the area we stop in for some of the best friend chicken I've ever had! The wings and strips are amazing and my favorites although everything is beyond delicious! I always have the wing dinner with Mac N Cheese and Collards. Those greens are the best I've ever had...sorry ma!!! The catfish is bomb too. Every bite is juicy and delicious! Super friendly and super delicious. Did I mention DELICIOUS?!!"}
{"text":"Great Service. They never disappoint. Food is great. Love the collard greens. Fried chicken, Fried Pork Chops, and the Shrimp PO Boy was delicious. Will definitely be coming back until I leave the Desert!!!"}
{"text":"This is the spot! Great service, very clean and the best shrimp and catfish l have ever had from a restaurant. My husband amd l will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"My little brother was here and fave it 5 stars! I'm hanging out with Claudine Wright! Good eats!!! Will be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on Friday night, excellent customer serivce and great food can't ask for anything else. Food was very good we tried the catfish dinners, fish was piping hot not greasy at all and the sides were great too. Greens were very good, we also tried the fries, mac and cheese, and the cole slaw. Will be back to sample the chicken and some of the desserts!!"}
{"text":"Purchased 2 Groupons for this restaurant. Owner says there was a mix-up and he won't honor them???!!! Who does that? I'm out $20 and he won't credit me anything and Groupon says all sales final.

Terrible first impression and now I won't go there out of principal. Not a good look. FYI...Groupon is still being sold."}
{"text":"Holy cow! We went to the AZ Fry Guy as we were in the Avondale area already. This place is for real. Southern food served with Southern hospitality.

I ordered the fried catfish. The outside was crunchy and the meat was light and flaky, and it went well with the chef's sauce. It was served sizzling hot and perfectly seasoned.

My partner ordered the chicken tenders, and let me tell you, this guy is a big eater, and he almost didn't finish. The tenders were HUGE! The chef seasoned them and served them fresh. These aren't your frozen chicken tenders, people.

We both had seasoned french fries and yams. Definitely try the yams!

As a Southern gal, I appreciated the drink choices. Sweet tea (so good!), Kool-Aid, and assorted Coke products (from a fountain!).

Two dinners and two drinks came out to $32 which is fair, especially considering the large portion sizes. They also have several daily specials if you're on a budget.

Do yourself a favor and visit them sometime."}
{"text":"Great food, and great customer service, this place is a must go, if you like real soul food!"}
{"text":"Yelpers got it right!  The staff was very friendly and generous. The food was perfect southern comfort food. We had the rib tibs and the shrimp. The ribs were smoky, peppery and sweet and I loved the shrimp (and I have never been a fan of shrimp before...ever). I would go back just for the shrimp...and the banana pudding!  The collard greens, coleslaw, mac n cheese...it was all great!  I'm so excited to go back and try more. The people really were so nice...give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"The bbq was very good , along with the sides of mac n cheese and collards. The service was superb!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal taste of soul in the west valley! Solid menu, great food, and excellent customer service. All orders are made fresh to your liking and really an authentic home cookin' taste. The chicken & waffles are my personal favorite! You got my vote! #supportsmallbusiness"}
{"text":"I had the fried tilapia dinner it was really good it came with 2 sides mac n cheese and potato salad which didnt disappoint either.  The staff is real friendly and its a clean establishment i will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"The food here was phenomenal from this Mississippi woman's perspective! Everything was hot and well seasoned. I am a huge fan of season salt on French fries and this restaurant seasons them perfectly! The catfish nuggets were SO good! Very well seasoned, outside was crunchy, inside was still juicy and not dried out at all! 

The chicken tenders are HUGE and so good! Well seasoned and maintains the juiciness. Mac and cheese was also scrumptious! 

Even though the chicken and catfish were fried, they were NOT excessively greasy as I've had from other places. 

The ONLY critique I have is the peach cobbler - it was kind of soupy and therefore the breading was soggier than I'm used to. Flavor was amazing just a little runny. 

The customer service is on point and the gentleman working were very pleasant and made effort to get to know their customers. We will definitely be returning.

The AZ Fry Guy is a hidden gem in Avondale and we will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! My husband and I drove from California to visit my In-Laws and I was searching on yelp for something to eat. I am so happy that I was able to find The AZ FRY guy. The best soul food restaurant that I've eaten at so far. The only disappoint is that when I go home to California I will not be able to have it. I ordered the catfish, yams, greens, Mac and cheese, potato salad and the corn bread muffin. Everything tasted like it was made in my Aunts kitchen. The pricing is very reasonable. All the containers with my sides were filled to the top. The young lady at the counter was so attentive and so sweet it made our experience that much more Wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted. Loved everything here. They kept checking up on us a couple times to make sure everything is okay."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time today.  I was looking for a new restaurant locally and found this place on Yelp.  It didn't look like much at first, but when we got our food, i realized this was a great place.  I had the fried pork chops with greens Mac and cheese and a cornbread muffin.The perk chops were seasoned perfectly, and the greens were the best Ive had.  Juicy, flavorful and loaded with pieces of ham.  The Mac and cheese was very cheesy and tasty as well.  Homemade cornbread muffin was tasty as well.  Top it off with a glass of red Kool Aid and and I was well satisfied.  I definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The most delicious soul food! You can't go wrong. Amazing lightly battered chicken. To die for greens, yams and mac-n-cheese. Great service. Clean restaurant and bathroom. Peach cobbler like your momma made! All kinds of love going into this food. Our new go to place for comfort food. Go here and eat your feelings!"}
{"text":"It was just ok. With better options close by I doubt that I will return. I ordered the Tilapia. Fish itself was cooked well but the breading was not great. Reminded me of the cheap stuff my mom used to bread fish when I was little. Not worth the price. The potato salad was good. 

I ordered Mac and cheese for the kids. While I enjoyed the twist of pepper in it, my kids were not impressed. 

I was very disappointed to find no high chairs in the restaurant. I did spot some booster seats but with a 1 year old who won't stay seated, this was not a good option. 

The service was ok but nothing special. The lady taking my order did seem like she wanted to be there. I had to ask for all silverware, which was behind the counter as it wasn't brought out with the food. Definitely not a deal clincher but just added to an already poor experience."}
{"text":"Very good food. I order the catfish and ribs for someone else. Everyone loved the food. Owner and staff were very friendly. Overall wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"This is the best soul food restaurant in AZ!
Kudos to the owner Greg for cooking me and my sister the best meal ever!! The greens, potato salad, chicken strips, and shrimp po'boy sandwich was amazing! The food was hot and fresh and seasoned to perfection!!!  I'm looking forward to our next visit and to using the catering services. Thank you \"G\". Job well done!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today.  Little place with charm.  The best fried chicken in the West valley.  The greens were delicious. I will be taking my spouse in for dinner soon"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, always a sceptic I thought I would be disappointed by the food. I took my best friend so I would have someone to suffer with. Much to my delight and happiness, the food was awesome! First it was pretty, you know the kind you WANT to eat. Next the serving size was great, you will be quite full in the belly when you leave. Very nicely decorated with comfortable seating, clean! You can get a wonderful corn muffin with a great choice of sides. Worth the visit and the awesome customer service! If you go once, you'll return!"}
{"text":"Great location in Avondale. Super clean and nicely decorated! Staff is friendly and greeted you as soon as you entered the establishment.
I ordered the catfish dinner to go and they really accommodated and had my order prepared in a timely manner. 
Catfish filets were cooked to a perfection, seasoned just right. Crispy on the outside and moist when you bit into it. It wasn't greasy at all! It tasted exactly how a well cooked fried fish should taste like! Greens were AMAZING!  I wish I ordered an extra side of it. We all know that not everyone can cook a batch of greens. It's either too bitter or it lacks flavor and all you taste is salt. These greens were seasoned so well, you can eat it by itself without adding vinegar or hot sauce. Yams were smooth and creamy, it wasn't super sweet as if you're eating brown sugar only. If you're looking for quality and authenticity, check this place out."}
{"text":"Wow, first time here, everything was delicious,   bunch of flavor and a lot of food, best mac and cheese."}
{"text":"The owner was welcoming and stands behind his food by following up with me to determine my level of satisfaction .. He put his leg, foot, and toe in his food.  The prices are reasonable for the large portions.  If you want great soul food you must try The AZ Fry Guy."}
{"text":"Love the fried chicken wings. I ordered togo, the order was ready when I arrived that is a plus in my book 20 mins is what I was told over the phone. The taste was great, with the right amount of seasoning, with the perfect crispy crunch not soggy."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for once again finding me some amazing food I would have never known existed. Small, very clean, friendly service and amazing food. I am very very picky about ribs and these were absolutely amazing! Must try."}
{"text":"We read reviews and decided to try it out. We got the wings combo with mac and cheese & collard greens. And wow to my surprise it was pretty darn good. Wings was super crispy, greens was on point and the mac and cheese was bomb.  We will for sure come back again. I recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! We just moved from El Dorado Hills Ca to Goodyear Az and what a find the AZ Fry Guy has been! They cook the food from scratch you can taste it so refreshing to get away from corporate diners and actually eat food cooked in a real kitchen. I had pork chops some greens macaroni and cheese with some corn bread I can smell it now!! Portions are generous and the people there were very nice. It's really hard to find a place like this these days but I'm glad I did!"}
{"text":"Today my husband and I decided to finally try AZ Fry Guy after driving by and checking Yelp many times. We were more than just a little impressed by their outstanding customer service and incredibly good food. We ordered the special of the two piece fried chicken (leg and thigh) with one side (potato salad) and a drink (grape kool-aid). We also ordered the 2 piece catfish with 2 sides (greens and mac & cheese). I got the tropical punch kool-aid. Everything was bomb!! Honestly, the best fried fish, crispiest chicken, amazing potato salad, THE BEST GREENS EVER, and excellent mac & cheese. The Kool-aid was on point. I can't say enough positive things about this place!! The young girl at the register was helpful, sweet, and kind. The owner my husband spoke with went out of his way to fix a couple of additional pieces of catfish for my elderly mom to try, since we couldn't stop eating our portions!  They deserve every single star. We will be back!! This place is definitely a hidden gem in the west valley."}
{"text":"Loved this place just got done eating here right now! The chicken breast usually I never eat anywhere because it's so dry! But, then I came to AZ fry guy and their chicken breasts were to die for! Usually I eat all my sides first then the chicken or main meal... but this time I ate the main course first and finished the sides last. The Mac and cheese though was my highlight, although the chicken was amazing as well, because I could taste the love our server her name was ebony and she was helpful and very kind hearted and talkative and that's something I look for in service! Thank you ebony if you see this review!!
Definitely should come here please!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little place, the food was delicious and the service was great. I had the rib special with greens and potato salad. Everything was very awesome!"}
{"text":"Went to AZ Fry Guy last week for the first time. We ordered a mixed platter with party wings, fried catfish, 2 sides and fry's.  This is some of the best fried chicken I had in the Phoenix area. The breading was not to thick and seasoned great. Cat fish was crispy on the outside and still flakey on the inside.  The greens had chunks of ham-hocks and the Mac and cheese was creamy and good. Today I happen to be in the area and went in for lunch. Leg, thigh one side and a drink for 5.99. You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"This is the best soul food in the West Valley. We surely needed it! I am a mac & cheese person, and theirs is really good!"}
{"text":"Me and some friends have heard about this place it was very good.  The  catfish was very good and light, Mac and cheese was creamy and peach cobbler was bomb.com. It is definite place to try and support black owned business and nice family."}
{"text":"It's Friday night and we are looking for a local restaurant. Found AZ Fry on Yelp and found their food to be very tasty, prepared and served by very nice people. 

Hubby ordered the special - 3 ribs, hot link and 2 sides (mac n cheese and greens). The ribs were huge. He really enjoyed the ribs. I ordered catfish which consisted of two cornmeal crispy fillets and 2 sides (yams and coleslaw). The yams were good, and I will definitely order them again. Hubby liked the greens best. 

The sides were twice the size that other restaurants serve. It was too much food for me, but somehow hubby managed to make it through. He did use a large quantity of napkins when tackling the ribs.

The young woman who took our order and delivered our food is a great example of customer service. I enjoyed speaking with her and the owner.

Our bill came to $35 with tip and two drinks. This was a good choice and we will come back to AZ Fry."}
{"text":"This was my 1st and last visit here. Was told the wait would be 25 minutes and ended up being twice that. Chicken tenders that were supposed to be extra crispy were borderline burnt, overcooked and dry. Bland mac & cheese, mediocre greens, underwhelming banana pudding plus they forgot the rolls. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"This is worth the extra effort to find it and you'll be rewarded for passing on Flavors of Louisiana to try The AZ Fry Guy.   Catfish and Chicken were fried and seasoned to perfection!  Extremely crispy without being greasy.  Chicken is a fried seasoned salt dry rub and it's delicious and juicy.  Mac n cheese is good and the greens are THE BEST GREENS IVE EVER TASTED!!

This place made my wife and I say \"Lo-Lo who?\"  And \"who's Mrs White\"?"}
{"text":"Good service, except for that one ratchet lady that was there that one day. Even though we're all black, you need to keep it professional. Secondly their food is good, consistent service, never got my order wrong. Nothing bad to say there. The only reason I'm not giving this restaurant five stars is because I feel the chicken can use more flavoring. But you know this is Arizona, The older Trump supporters like bland food."}
{"text":"The food here is yummy. We were visiting family in the area and decided to pick up some take out before heading to their home. Luckily we called ahead. The restaurant was closed for the day but they took our order anyway. How courteous! You definitely don't find that kind of service on the east coast. As soon as we entered, we were greeted with a friendly smile. The restaurant was extremely clean. The food was delicious. We ordered the party wings, catfish fillets, and chicken strips. All were fried really well. The sides were even better. I highly recommend their potato salad and yams. Wish we ordered more sides."}
{"text":"After reading about this place online we decided to visit last week and we are glad we did.  My wife and I had the 4 rib special, which is only on the menu on Fridays.  The ribs and sauce were great as were the sides.  

The owner was great and went over the menu with us and since it was our first visit, he gave us complimentary cornbread muffins and banana pudding.  Everything tasted great - good old comfort food.  The ribs were good quality with a lot of meat.  We both agreed that we will definitely return to AZ Fry Guy!"}
{"text":"As much as I like the location, the cleanliness, and the friendliness of the employees, I have to be honest about my experience. All of the food was way too salty for my taste and there were items written on a board that were not on the menu. For example, rib tips. Would that be beef or pork ribs? I guess you have to ask. This place is not cheap (prices are fair). My wife and I spent $31 to eat here.

They were out of the banana pudding, so we tried the cherry cobbler... ended up throwing it away.

The 'party wings' are breaded. This is not a good thing or a bad thing, just unexpected. I prefer Buffalo wings not breaded, but that's my preference. They do show a picture on the menu of traditional Buffalo style wings. Maybe you have to request them that way? I have no idea.

The Fry Guy knows how to fry! All of the food was cooked perfectly. Chicken was not under or over-cooked. Best to wait at least 10 minutes before eating what they serve, because it is served literally right out of the fryer and fried chicken stays hot for a long time. This is much preferred to pre-cooking everything and keeping it under a heat lamp all day (ex. Popeye's Fried Chicken). Just be aware of it.

The breading on the chicken and the wings was very, very salty. The chicken itself was very moist and cooked to perfection. One portion of fries is enough to feed at least 3 people. The fries appear to be fried from frozen. They are good, but not home made.

Everyone that works here is very nice. Unfortunately, it's no competition to LoLo's or Guido's as I had hoped it would be because it's more conveniently located to my home.

While I certainly won't tell them how to flavor their food, a low-salt option might be worth considering. Both my wife and I felt quite bloated and gassy after eating here. Not sure if that has to do with the salt, other seasonings or the oil they fry in... just an observation.

Overall, they are nice people and I wish them success in their business. I just wish I would've loved it."}
{"text":"Love the chicken, greens and mac n cheese. It usually takes 20-30 minutes for an order so call ahead."}
{"text":"Great barbecue, got the ribs and hot link.  Also tried the fried chicken.  Ribs were very meaty and had a nice smoky flavor.  Was pleasantly surprised, they must have a nice smoker hidden back there.  Chicken was juicy and had good flavor too.  It's a small place, seems to be family owned - they don't have a lot of throughput so be prepared for 15-20 minute wait.  It's worth trying."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I had the fried chicken, coleslaw, and mac and cheese.  The chicken was very juicy and seasoned to perfection.  I love chicken and waffles and I was weary of trying new places but this place is off the hook!  The kool-aid was delicious and the mac and cheese melts in your month.  The staff was very attentive.  This will be my new soul food spot on the west side."}
{"text":"In Phoenix for a trip and stopped In. Ordered the Catfish and wings. Catfish was excellent! Fresh and cooked perfectly. Had a side of fries which were perfect as well. Wings were flavorful and juicy. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'll be sure to make the trip here again for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Just finished my food and all I can say is BOMB AF!! First and foremost can I just say the handsome gentleman working the register was amazing and had great customer skills. He tried to get me to take a bit of the food since it was my first time eating here and I was taking out but now I see why!

The greens were ( not exaggerating) the best greens I had at a Phoenix restaurant. Perfect amount of flavoring. The mac and cheese and yams were so good I couldn't put the damn fork down! The catfish was nice and moist as well. 

AZ Fry Guy is for sure my new favorite spot regardless of its 30 minute drive. I will definitely be returning and will be sure to eat in this time. On top of everything else this place is family owned . I love what you guys are doing! Keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"Just passing through and found this place through Yelp. Wow! Soooo good. Wish we had one of these at home. It has a little bit of a cajon kick, but I'm normally a wuss and I handled it fine. Chicken tenders were cooked beautifully and were generously sized. Happened to be a rib special today, and they were some of the best I've ever had. Can't go wrong with this place!!!"}
{"text":"OMG! I am so happy to see a new soul food restaurant on the west side! I had the catfish lunch and the fillets were crispy and fried perfectly.  I also ordered greens for my side but he also gave me a complimentary side of black-eyed peas that were off the chain! I wanted to eat the whole bowl but I was too full. If you want some good food in a clean relaxing environment, come try this place. You won't be disappointed. I only wish I had room for dessert!"}
{"text":"This service was so nice and the food slaps ! Best soul food on the west side. It's so refreshing to not have to drive far for good food. And prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"The food was tasty.  We tried most of the stuff on the menu.  Shrimp needs more flavor. Mac and cheese was good.  Greens too."}
{"text":"Wings are awesome and the fish is pretty good. Hours can be a little unpredictable so I would call ahead. If the are closed taste of Louisiana across the street is a good back up."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD! Very clean place. Service was pretty good also. My hubby and I each ordered the shrimp po boy lunch and my daughter had the chicken tenders kids meal. Our shrimp po boy was so delicious. My daughter loved her tenders.. they were not fast food style, they were authentic. Fries are really good. Everything was fresh. Bill was to $32 bucks so won't be eating here too frequently, but I will definitely go back when we are craving some soul food. I would highly recommend! ! Thank you AZ fry guy!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was surprised. First attempt to visit was on a Sunday, but they were closed. Second try Saturday for lunch.  Just a family ordering before us, which took forever, so I was a bit disappointed because there was no else in the restaurant.  We ordered the fried catfish with side of coleslaw and mac and cheese.  All was delicious, fresh with that homemade black skillet cooking.  The hostess came by the table while we were eating and I told her how good everything was. She apologized for the wait of the food, but food came out in a timely manner, it was the standing in line to order the food that was uncomfortable.  Anywho I'll be back. That catfish was yummy."}
{"text":"This soul food restaurant just open about three months ago in my neighborhood. I just tried it tonight and it was absolutely fabulous!! The greens were so yummy the mac & cheese was good and the catfish was so tender and lightly crispy. I recommend it to everybody!!! The Fry Guy highly recommended when you have a taste for some good soul food! So glad it's soo close to me!!"}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp and thought we'd give it a try, and I'm glad we did. There are only 2 soul food spots that I like here in AZ and they are downtown Phoenix, so now that I'm in Goodyear, I don't need to drive so far! It's a small place but and the menu is just how I like it...simple. Had the fried (hard) catfish dinner with the mac and cheese and greens, my husband had the rib and hot link special with greens and yams, my daughter had the 5 piece chicken tender dinner with fries and mac and cheese. Dinners were about $12-$13 per person...it may seem a little pricey but believe me when I say you get HUGE PORTIONS! The chicken tenders could have fed us all! The batter/crust on both the chicken and catfish were delicious. The mac and cheese was cheesy, and the greens were so good too. The yams were good but it seemed as if they put a little too much nutmeg in them, but they were still tasty. The Kool aid was tart and perfectly sweetened, I mean, this place is way better that some other so called \"soul food\" restaurants we have tried in the west valley. I'll definitely be back. Oh and we had the hot wings too... I never knew how good lemon pepper wings were until now! It would have been nice to have the hot links on the menu but I didn't see it sold a la cart so I tasted my husbands that were part of the daily special, they were good and I wouldn't mind eating that as a dinner too. Overall great service from the young girl up front and everything came out hot and ready!"}
{"text":"My 3 friends and I came here for lunch.  We all left with to go boxes.  One had chicken tenders, one had wings, one had the porboy shrimp and the other had the catfish specials. We all loved our food!  It was delicious and even got a sample of greens and macncheese.  

We would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The food and service here is beyond great!!! Have tried a good chunk of the menu and not disappointed at all. Definitely suggest trying the pork chop and smothered tri tip"}
{"text":"I'll never step foot inside this establishment again.  We purchased a Groupon for his business.  When we went there to redeem it he did not honor it. His only response was he didn't authorize the Groupon and didn't want our business if we're going to complain.  FYI the Groupon is still out there so buyer beware."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch. Really good cross section of tasty choices. Even a terrific sweet tea. Service is not quick but they tell you it will take 20 minutes when you place your order.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken and it was amazing!! Tasted super home-y (not fast food-y) Greens were f***ing BOMB!!!, Ribs tips were also good, Mac n cheese was eh we didn't get our corn bread when we ordered our meal so idk about that but over all it was really good but a bit too pricey. The service was also good super nice guys.. Also had chicken tenders & fries like REAL chicken tenders NOT frozen ones & fries were eaten on the way home....Oh and the kool-aid daaaammmnnn ya'll"}
{"text":"Definitely the best soul food I've tasted in a while .. my favorite has to be the catfish dinner !! New to AZ and my mother introduced me to this place a while back before i moved here and been in love ever since!"}
{"text":"Had rib special and catfish! True to form thought we were in Big Mama's kitchen! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Just like the pictures look this guys food is straight garbage. I ordered a chicken breast meal or whatever the fuck it was but the meat was rubbery and the seasoning, like he whipped that shit on the floor. Over priced and nasty as fuck, I don't curse on reviews but I'm highly disappointed. He should pay people to even eat that crap."}
{"text":"Very expensive... but the food is great but It's located in a crazy spot but they are very nice people
But I expect good soul food do cost money so it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"So happy to find Soul Food in the West Valley. Friendly service and awesome food. Nice large portions and always fresh and hot. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place was amazing! The hubby & I had an impromptu date night here. We had wings, catfish, mac & cheese, and greens. We will definitely be back! The wings are huge and perfectly cooked! The service was friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while trying to find a good fish fry and was so happy to check it out. The place is super clean! Just amazing. Came in and was greeted instantly and told about the specials of the day which sounded yummo. We ordered the catfish and the talapia which were breaded perfectly! The french fries had a yummy seasoning on them too. The portions were huge! My daughter barely made a dent in hers! I was very impressed and I will be happy to go back. I wish they had a diaper station in the bathroom though, the only downfall of taking the family here."}
{"text":"We had the catfish, greens, blackeyed peas, chicken tenders and banana pudding. DAMN! We couldn't eat all of it but sure tried. So delicious!! I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal...one of the best soul food places in Arizona...tastes like my grandma makes"}
{"text":"Chicken was FIRE . Greens were FIRE . Macaroni was FIRE. I wanted to try this place for a while and wasnt disappointed."}
{"text":"Best catfish in Arizona! I went yesterday for my first time and loved it. Awesome costumer service and you get a lot of food for a nice price. I was shocked to see how much food I got. If you love soul food this is the spot! Definitely will be a regular now. :)"}
{"text":"Where do you have dinner after walking around the mall? Here! I'm pregnant and needed fried chicken. We tried the chicken, shrimp, and catfish. Sides were: yams, Mac and cheese, greens, Cole slaw, and potato salad. Everything we had was freshly  fried and delicious. We burned ourselves with every bite, but  was worth it. The wait is a little long, but it's expected when waiting for stuff to fry and cook properly. Do not.I repeat, do not leave this place without taking some cobbler to go. Trust me. We had both the cherry and peach. Bomb.com Come here because of the Friendly staff, AC runs cold, plenty of refills and great food. We will be back."}
{"text":"The owner was there and very nice and informative. We had a conversation about his business and told him I was looking for something like this in my area. He gave me a sample of his catfish and black eyed peas. They both were delicious. I took a meal home to share with my wife and she too was impressed. We will definitely be back. Go try this place out! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Mr. Hall provides excellent customer service and is very attentive to his customers the food was extremely good too.  I highly recommend this restuarant to anyone in the Phoenix area.  Definitely check this place out whenever you are in the West valley."}
{"text":"Great fried chicken place! Nice light batter with some spice, retained the juicy chicken, amazing mac & cheese. Service was excellent. Owner gave me a free drink when I decided to dine in. Missed out on the bbq but I'll be back to try it. 

Place is small and you might miss the sign but it's directly across from Walmart. If you have a large group I'd probably call ahead cuz this is a one man show, food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"The best catfish, Mac and Cheese in the West Valley!!! Clean restaurant with friendly workers and also great banana pudding!!"}
{"text":"Saw some soul food and had to give it a try...

Ambience (4/5): Open restaurant with just a few booths and tables. Nothing special decor wise. But very clean.

Service (5/5): friendly cashier and workers. Checked up on me during the meal and also wanted to talk and find out what brought me to try their place out.

Food (4.5/5): I ordered the two catfish fillets dinner for $12.99 which came with two sides. I chose greens and mac & cheese. I also added a chicken tender for $1.
The catfish was delicious. I do not like heavy battered fried food. This was light and crispy with corn meal.
The greens was best part. Had little bits of ham in it too.
The mac & cheese was okay. It didn't stand out but it was not bad. I seasoned it with some hot sauce. Next time I'll try a different side.
The chicken tender was a little rubbery but tasted good. Had a nice seasoning on it.
Be aware it took about 15 minutes to get my food. But I would rather wait and know it's fresh.

Overall I would come back but try some other things. The yams looked good."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday for lunch. My husband found it on yelp. I had the catfish it was fried crispy but it was still moist inside. The catfish was amazing! The greens were yummy as well. Now I'm a mac n cheese critic and the mac n cheese is delicious, cheesy and creamy! The house tartar sauce and as good with the fish too! My husband had the whole chicken wings and they were good! This the best soul food in Avondale!!! Must try this place! Worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"First time in, but won't be the last. Perhaps the best fried chicken I've ever had. Potato salad was homemade and delicious. Can't wait to try the other sides on the menu. As a transplant from the south it was nice to have a taste of home!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. She loves the catfish, greens,  and chicken wings. I don't eat meat anymore so I go for the mac and cheese. The mac and cheese is legit! Service is excellent too. Great food, great service, and great mac and cheese.....THAT MAC AND CHEESE IS LEGIT!!!!! Highly recommended swinging by there for some good eats!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and decided to try it out and I wasn't disappointed. I had the catfish with Mac and cheese and yams! The fish was fried to perfection! I also got the kids meal for my son and it was a lot of food! Nice hearty portions! He loved the chicken tenders! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. The potato salad was extra creamy--delicious but different from anything that I've ever had before. Also, on my visit the location ran out of stock on at least a couple of the most popular items. With all of these great reviews, AZ Fry Guy is going to have to step up the stock."}
{"text":"Great fried chicken!  Everyone who came in ordered it...  me I ordered the fried fish , my hubby ordered the chicken , next time I will order the Chicken too!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Stopped by after work for dinner. Had the catfish dinner with mac and cheese, greens and sweet potatoes. It was awesome! Believe me if you go there you won't be disappointed. The food is excellent.
The customer service is excellent The owner is really nice and cares about the quality of food he prepares for his customers. I even had the Kool aid which. Took me back to childhood. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food along with exceptional customer service.  Every time I come in I'm always greeted with a warm welcome. Couldn't pick another place to enjoy a nice meal on a good day like today.  The AZ Fry Guy never disappoints."}
{"text":"This is my fav chicken place in Az. I've been all over the south and this surpasses some of the best extra crispy fried chicken I've had. The chicken is crispy yet moist and juicy. The greens were cooked perfectly and had a great after taste. I actually drank the greens liquor it was that good. Mac and cheese was hot and satisfying. The peach cobbler was good but no comparison to the rest of the meal. The portions are huge so order accordingly. Finally the Kool-aid was perfect, not too sweet just right and super cold. Great experience and I look forward to returning many more times and recommending this to anyone looking for a great meal."}
{"text":"The best catfish I've had since moving from Chicago to AZ. I've also had the chicken tenders with Mac and Cheese and it was good too."}
{"text":"Wanted some soul food without having to drive to Mrs. Whites and or LoLos so decided to go here and the decision was a great one! Ordered the Catfish and Greens as the side. The catfish was pretty good. Not the best I've ever had but not bad at all. The Greens though, damn, the greens were the best greens I have ever ate. So good I would probably travel here just to get like 3 sides of greens and be content! The woman at the counter was really nice and very helpful! If you like comfort food you gotta check this place out!!"}
{"text":"Normally I like smothered pork chops. Azfryguys fried pork chops was so melt in your mouth delicious. So far everything I've tried has been  and customer service was great. Will for sure be back and try other things"}
{"text":"Second time here and the food is just as good in fresh as the first time! Everything comes out fresh and hot! Customer service is outstanding! Fry chicken is amazing ! Also had the yams, greens, and mac and cheese taste just like momma made it ! Spoke with the owner and he stated that they do BBQ on Friday and Saturday can't wait to try it this weekend!  Looking for a change of pace and a good home cook meal give AZ FRY GUY a chance you want be disappointed! #goodeats #westsidesoulfood #"}
{"text":"Omg this place has the best catfish I've had and chicken wings in forever! Banana pudding is so tasty and i hate pudding. Honestly the amount of food you get for the price is much better compared to going across the street to Flavors of Louisiana."}
{"text":"Small joint in a strip mall that delivers some amazing soul food.  I don't know how they managed to cram that much flavor in greens!  Nice chunks of smokey pork in it.  Mac and cheese was legit!  The Fry Guy was able to cook chicken breast all the way and it stayed juicy.  Had a nice flavorful crispy crust that adhered well to the chicken.  You can tell these are family recipes!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday and was very disappointed.  The wife's chicken portions were big but sadly over cooked and dry.  My Shrimp poor boy was a sloppy mess and not edible as a sandwich.  Not the right kind of bread for a poor boy.

The owner was friendly and the establishment was clean.  However the owner was a little unhappy that we brought in a Groupon.  I was told after the application of the Groupon that my bill was $8.08.  I gave him a $20.  He had to fish around for change as the till did not have sufficient change.  Meanwhile he was engaging in pleasant chit chat with us.  Finally he handed me $8.08 in change.  I said to him that the change was incorrect, he said no the $8.08 charge was before he hit the tax button.  When he applied the tax it came up to $11.92.  WHAT!!! Sales tax on $8.08 is $3.84, no It is not.  I am a senior citizen but not that senile.  He insisted that was the right amount when really the $11.92 should have been my change.  I let it go because I did not want to make a public fuss over a few bucks, as it was a cheap meal with the Groupon that he did not really want honor in the first place.

Needless to say we will never return to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Friendly engaged service, good food and good prices! This is worth many a repeat visit. Went with a friend who loves catfish and said this was delicious!"}
{"text":"Drove all the way to Avondale for this. Worth it! I had the fried chicken with mac n cheese and greens. Flavorful! I also tried their special, ribs and hot links - good stuff. Great service. Don't mind waiting a little bit because the food was freshly cooked."}
{"text":"First time here and we couldn't have asked for better service or better food. I ordered the fried catfish (with mac & cheese and yams.. which taste like Christmas BTW)my husband the pork chops (same sides) and the little ones ate the chicken nuggets with french fries. Our table was SO quiet (not usually the case with an active 2 year old and chatty 7 year old) because we were just devouring the food. Everything was super fresh and the homemade sauce (we dipped everything into this sauce) was amazing! We are already planning our next trip in.. I see you shrimp po'boy ;)"}
{"text":"Best Soul Food in AZ! This place is a must try. Great customer service, excellent food, and great portions. I live on the east side but will gladly make the drive to come here again soon."}
{"text":"Had the catfish fillets. Sooo good. Crispy. Cooked perfectly. Had the Mac and cheese for the side. Tasted home made. Now I know where to go when I am craving Mac and cheese. Definitely recommend this place and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"My new go-to place to eat on the west valley. I will say that everything was delicious and fresh. The hospitality was amazing. It's been a while since I've met an owner that actually focuses on connecting with his customers. I can tell that he truly cares about quality and it was definitely delivered!"}
{"text":"I'll definitely be back to AZ Fry Guy to try more items off the menu.  

Today I had the chicken tenders with mac and cheese.  

As I've read in a few reviews, the chicken was pretty salty. The overall flavor of the chicken was 4/5, but the cook on the chicken was an absolute 5/5 - crunchy outside and perfectly moist inside.  

Mac and cheese doesn't leave me wanting more. It was pretty bland and a 2/5. Honestly, it tasted like a store bought prepackaged tray with a little coarse ground pepper added. 

I will be back though.  I am excited to give the catfish a try!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!! . 10/10 would highly recommend it. Got the fried chicken tenders, wings, and catfish. It blew my expectations out of the water, the breading is PERFECT. These guys know what they are doing. The cornmeal breading on the fish was something to die for, as well as the chicken wings and tenders. Evenly cooked and juicy on the inside, super crispy on the outside, and not greasy. What else can you ask for?! Every other place you eat after this will be a disappointment. They even gave me one to try when I walked in, now that's customer service! If you are reading this, just come and try it out, you won't leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I have been absolutely blown away by the quality of food and service. The whole wings were seasoned and cooked incredibly well. The gentleman who runs the place is friendly and comes by the table to chat and discuss how the food was. My buddy ordered the catfish and was raving about it. Apparently on Fridays and Saturdays they also serve pork ribs. They allowed me to give one a try and I was very impressed. For the price and experience I really can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem. These guys know how to fry their chicken,fish and pork chops. Perfectly season moist and huge pieces. Everything is made fresh so expect a little wait. Be patient. It's worth it. I had the fried the chicken. 2 nice size pieces. The 2 piece tilapia was moist and season to perfection. Their greens with turkey was amazing. The coleslaw with apples and raisins was so refreshing and original. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Been in AZ for 3 years and honestly this is the best customer service and food we have encountered!!! I'm originally from Alabama my Husband is from Mississippi and the catfish here just took us back down south!! The best chicken I have had in years seasoned perfectly!! Definitely worth the trip from Laveen. And thank you for the great customer service."}
{"text":"This is my second time visit this place after Yelp recommended it. Their food is awesome! best soul food  in the Phoenix! Their fried chicken and pork chops are to die for. I do highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Took our family to grab quick fix of some cat fish!!!! Amazing!!!!! Ribs were delicious too!!!! Will definitely be back, weekly!"}
{"text":"The catfish was incredible. It was perfectly breaded. Great flavor. Mac and cheese just like Kasey's grandma's (and that's a good thing). Chicken tenders are huge and crispy. Very friendly staff and a clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Hard fried lightly battered catfish, greens with smoked turkey, yams, mac n'cheese. If this is on your mind for dinner, this is the spot for you.  Staff is charming, smiling and so nice. Military discount and on Wednesday is senior discount night. Will be back to try more of the menu in the future. Also had a steady stream for carry out."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here today.  I must say, the food was awesome.  We ordered a fried chicken breast, fried catfish, collard greens, yams, potato salad, macaroni and cheese, banana pudding (to go) and peach cobbler (to go).  I asked to have my chicken fried extra crispy.  The chicken was fried to perfection.  The seasoning was perfect.  The other food we ate was also awesome.  The porttion sizes were great and we had to ask for to go bag.  The food was better than Lo Lo's and Mrs. White's.  We will definitely return again."}
{"text":"I was searching around for some good soul food on the west side of town. I'm glad I found this place!!!
The chicken is really good, now I will admit it took a few extra minutes, but damn it was well worth the wait!! It was cooked perfectly and had the best flavor, I was quite impressed. 
I also had the green and the macaroni and cheese.  Both were good especially the green!! The peach cobbler was good too!! 
I've been back twice this week already, so yea it's that good.  
The place was extremely clean looking and smelling.  
Keep up the good cooking!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We have my in-laws in from VA right now and everyone loved their food- fried catfish nuggets, party wings, Mac, greens (my fav) and fries. The biggest deal was that my father-in-law can never eat a meal without complaining and he didn't say one word at the table!!! He ordered \"naked\" wings and loved them!"}
{"text":"In town for a few days and turned to Yelp.l for suggestions. We ordered the chicken and waffles, chicken tenders, and  catfish. We each tried each other's dish and I can assure you, it was all excellent! Food was fresh, extremely hot, and oozing with flavor. 
Staff was extremely friendly, restaurant was very clean, and food was second to none.
 A must do!"}
{"text":"I've heard about this restaurant from numerous people and decided to finally step in and give it a try for myself. From the moment my friend and I met the owner, we just knew we were right at home. He was very friendly and recommended the best with it being our first time. Everything came out smelling just right and the taste took me right back to my childhood as my Grandma used to make similar dishes when I was little. We were sitting there moaning in our seats as we chowed down lol The owner also brought us out a sample of the fried chicken to try and we chowed that down too. To say we liked the food and customer service there is an understatement. When people used to ask me about Soul Food in Phoenix I would always give them the name of a restaurant that I once knew. Now that I've had the BEST I no longer know that restaurants name and I will be pointing them in the right direction and that's THE AZ FRY GUY. 5 STARS!"}
{"text":"I found this place by accident, and thank God. On the door is their A+ rating from the health department, which I think is a great start. The staff is friendly. The place is small but pristine and very comfortable. The FOOD IS DELICIOUS and its not overpriced. BYE LOLOs! So I ordered the rib special with collard greens, cornbread and Mac and cheese. My friend ordered catfish, which is another winner. This food is hand-clapping, thank you Jesus, shoutin- shoes good!"}
{"text":"Been coming to The AZ Fry Guy for a while now, and I can honestly say, I am never disappointed here! It's a small tucked away location that has huge portions with huge flavor. When I come in, it's always a tough choice but I can never go wrong with the catfish po'boy and my g.f. gets the 3 piece tenders. Wow, did I mention that flavor? Consistent and always delicious! My personal favorite side is the greens, but today I went with the yams, and it was a tasty treat, not too sweet but just right! Oh! And if you get the kool-aid or sweet tea, it's always made perfect! (I got diet coke this time but I do get kool-aid normally) if you check this place out, you won't be disappointed and you won't leave with an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, this place will be added to our list of favorites.  Large portions, friendly people, and the best greens in town."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food and the staff are amazing. Happy to have real soul food in the Avondale/Goodyear area. I always get the fry chicken and it always comes out great. I would also suggest the catfish and fry shrimp."}
{"text":"Awesome...everything was delish.  Fried chicken, cole slaw (with apples - nice touch), creamy potato salad, black eyed peas, and Mac n cheese, all awesome!  Owner and waitress were super friendly.  Place was spotless. 

We weren't sure if they were open.  It looked dark from the outside.  Maybe make the open side flash.  Also the door sign showed 0:00 to 8:00 pm.  I'd fix that especially since I want to keep coming back and I don't want them to go away for lack of enough customers!"}
