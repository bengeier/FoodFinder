{"text":"When I first walked around the corner and saw the quaint little bakery, I was a little skeptical due to the hole in the wall location. I was kindly greeted by a friendly face and a variety of pastry options. I ordered a coconut pastry which was the perfect amount of sweet and flakey. Prices are extremely reasonable and the venue is truly unique. Would definitely recommend if you are in need of a quick pick me up or a sweet and unique treat for the office!"}
{"text":"I like Asian Sweet Bakery, but their foods have been inconsistent so far. So, it is kinda hit or miss. But, with that price, I would not complain that much, thus the four-star rating.   When I come here, I always have: 1. red bean bun (soak it with unsweetened soy milk or milk) 2. sponge cake (eat it with tea) 3. fried pork dumpling (come as early as 11am, otherwise they are gone) 4. Porridge with Chinese donut  Skip the mooncake (too sweet for my taste, and it is not the mooncake that I had in the past)"}
{"text":"Yay finally!! I don't have to go to Chicago for some asian cravings!! I know the asian marts here carry baked goodies from chicago, but having freshly baked awesomeness right here in town is a totally different story.  I've been to Asian Sweet twice before, but I waited until my third time to pen this review because the first 2 times I went in the afternoon, and only for the bakery items, which by that time they were mostly sold out, so I only got to try very selected stuff. But today we made it right as they open after consulting friends who have pro tips (go early!).   Their food items are a real deal, you can easily get a full breakfast complete with coffee/tea or a mix of coffee and tea (yuan yang) for less than $10. They offer all day breakfast and lunch items starting at 11 am. I will be going back to try their lunch items some time soon. The tofu and fish over rice looks amazing! We had the shrimp crepe, wonton noodles, chive dumplings and pork congee set today. The crepe, dumplings and congee were all nicely done. I found the wonton noodles a little on the plain side, probably cause we had that right after the crepe, which came with soy sauce. But that aside, the wonton doesn't have pork in them, only shrimps, not quite the best you can get in town, but not too bad.   As I mentioned right at the start their freshly baked goods really stand out. Finally I got  the long awaited egg custard and char siew buns yay!! And they are really good. The red bean buns are another popular item on the menu too. These sell out fast. While I was in line I see different groups of people come in and grab more than ten bakery items at one go. Amazing!   So, go early for the best selection!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Asian bakery place in town! Every time I go, always buy too much carry out but the food is SO GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Ponkey Kong was here, and Ponkey Kong *LOVED* it! No frills kind of place with great congee. And the prices??? YES PLZ. For less than five bucks I had congee with a generous portion of pork liver and preserved egg, a large red bean bun (sweet and moist) and coffee. Long live Sweets Asian Bakery!"}
{"text":"There are few times in life when a bun is so masterfully crafted and prepared that it is nothing short of genius. Today I had one of those buns.   Entering Sweet's Asian Bakery is like embarking on a culinary journey, it is both exciting and adventurous yet still so familiar. The decor is exquisite: simple but elegant with lots of white and clean lines, and a few scattered purple orchids for a splash of color. I ordered the fish fillet with mustard cabbage my friend the shrimp wonton soup. Both were delicious. But the real star of the show was the desert, the hot dog bun. If you were to tell me yesterday that a white bread bun stuffed with hot dog and cheese would make me weak at the knees, why, I wouldn't believe you! I am a lady of stature, a world traveller, a doctor, you see. Anyways, my point is this hot dog bun may be the most sublime thing I have put in my mouth.   Delicious,  divine, tasty...  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Friendly folks, reasonable prices, and a decent selection are the highlights of this Chinese Bakery. It actually has a welcoming vibe (very rare for your hole-in-the-wall Chinese Bakeries!) but the reason I don't rate this higher is because I wasn't overly impressed with the quantity or quality of the ingredients within most of the buns.  For the custard bun, the bun was gigantic but the custard was smaller than a penny in diameter. It was not well-balanced. For the pork bun/turnover, I felt the same way-- very little in the way of filling. It was unfortunate, because I thought they could be my go-to bakery, but alas, my hunt goes on..."}
{"text":"The only asian bakery I know of around Madison. Buns are freshly made everyday and they always sell out of my favorite, the bbq pork bun. (With good reason). This is my stop for some breakfast congee/porridge/jook as it is cheaply priced and tastes like home. The other items on their menu also invoke the memories of homemade chinese food. The food is fairly simple, so don't expect anything too fancy. It's great if you need a taste of something wholesome."}
{"text":"Great bakery items like barbecue pork buns and red bean paste buns. But the real surprise is the tasty lunch items like the soups and beef with pickled mustard greens! And great prices"}
{"text":"I've tried pretty much every Chinese restaurant in Madison in search of food that tastes like my mom's home cooking, and this place is by far the closest I've found. They have all the traditional Chinese baked goods (sweet top buns, taro twists, cream buns, egg tarts, cake rolls, sesame balls), they make them well, and they never skimp on the fillings. I was particularly excited to find that they had \"wife cake\", a flat pastry filled with winter melon that has always been a favorite of mine. In terms of food, most of their dishes are solid. I particularly like the fish fillet with fried tofu and the beef with pepper and black bean sauce. Their vegetable selection is somewhat disappointing, but that's inevitable considering the incredibly low prices they charge and the general lack of fresh Asian vegetables here in Madison. Their breakfast food is a bit more hit or miss. Their congee is all right, but I don't plan on getting the dumplings, crepes or turnip cake again."}
{"text":"So glad this place opened! Before you could get Chinese baked goods in groceries around town, but they were trucked up from Chicago and would only be fresh once a week. Great egg tarts, custard buns, barbecue pork, etc. I'd love to see more savory buns like tuna or curry beef, but they do a lot with the little triangular space. Good hot food too. This place was my introduction to congee. It's a very satisfying meal for about four dollars, and for a little more you can get a side of pot stickers."}
{"text":"This place is seriously really good, and I've been enjoying it recently for breakfasts, lunches, and snacks.  The prices are very affordable and the lady who womans the counter is really friendly and remembers me when I come in.  Their baked goods and buns are fun, creative, and delicious.  Their noodles, crepes, and congee are really flavorful too.  I can't remember the exact name, but one of their fish stir-fry rice entrees is incredibly flavorful also.  Yesterday I tried their milk tea for the first time and will be having that every time I'm there too:)"}
{"text":"I've been there more than ten times since the first time I found their tarts overwhelmingly delicious. Tried almost every baked goods and every entree! Can't find a better place to enjoy Cantonese style food anywhere else in Madison. Congee and spicy fish with rice are favorite; boyfriend loves beef noodle, which is very similar with what you can have in Hong Kong, but maybe too light (no flavor) for me.  We booked many cakes and tarts and breads to the department meeting, and nobody had any donuts from the beginning to the end. Really love this place!"}
{"text":"I loved how cute and cozy this place is.  The bread selection had a range in variety from sweet to savory.  The Rainbow Roll was divine, and I can't wait to come back for more.  What I would like to see is more selections of bread and perhaps baking more so they are more fresh for some who come mid-day.  Overall, it was a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I have been here three times.   The rice crepes were warm, soft, chewy and umami with the soy sauce. Shrimps were  tender and juicy. The pork rib rice crepe was also tasty, but the meat was a little too fatty for me.  The shrimp wontons were large, filled with meat and whole shrimp. The soup had a generous amount of cabbage. I liked that the soup was savory and not salty, and that it tasted nothing like a salty oily soup stock that overwhelmed the overall flavor.   I had the beef fried rice noodles for lunch - hot, tasty, lots of beef and bell peppers! Noodles were chewy and sticky in a good way.   Sweet top bun with egg custard was fresh out of the oven, soft, warm and moist, not too sweet, the best I've had. Red bean bread was also great.  Coconut puff is a must-have. Flaky, sweet, dense and moist. I can eat them all day.  Staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Five stars for authentic food! You won't see any orange chicken on the menu here -- instead, congee, dumplings, and Chinese crepes abound. The whole shop is filled with the aroma of fresh pastries that are common in China.  It is a very small hole-in-the-wall kind of place, but though the food comes on paper plates with plastic utensils, the flavor of the food always stays true to Chinese cuisine. I definitely reccomend the Taro bun and any of the dumplings. A good way to spend very little money for very delicious returns."}
{"text":"Great sweet egg tarts(tan tart) that are authentic and freshly baked. Humongous portion of BBQ pork fried rice that is also cheap. Rice crepe(Cheong fun) has skin that is a bit too thick."}
{"text":"First time here and left great impression on me and my husband. Will definitely come back! The lady at cashier was very friendly and took orders carefully.  We ordered a bit of everything and I especially love their congee.  No tip either.  Price was pleasant for me--a bowl of congee for 1 person is 5, pretty cheap in the US.  We lived in HK before and I especially miss congee, especially when I am slightly under the weather, or not liking American food that much.  The congee here was good enough, and even my husband said it reminded him of HK again.  I like the fact everything is not overly seasoned. Congee not too salty, sweet bun not too sweet and seem freshly made, chang fen (rice noodle roll) lightly seasoned.  I finally don't need to tell them, less oil please, or if possible.  It is pretty carb oriented, but doesn't bother me at all (I love carb!). If you want you have other protein choices as well, even though I didn't really like the fish dish--small broken pieces of frozen fish sautéed with pickles, with rice, 6 USD.    I feel so grateful for this place because it reminds me of home and my culture, in an economic way."}
{"text":"Ordered the shrimp crepe,  shrimp wonton and dumpling soup,  9pc pot stickers,  and beef fried rice all for a grand total of. .. $20!   The shrimp crepe are steamed shrimp in a gluttonous pillow of dough and comes with a side of dark sauce. The soup was a clear and very light broth filled with Napa cabbage and generous portions dumplings and shrimp wonton. The beef fried rice was as healthy as fried rice comes in a Chinese establishment with thick slices of beef,  green onions,  and scrambled eggs. My partner remarked how it was plain,  and in a good way.   The pot stickers are where it's at!  They are pan fried,  golden pockets of perfection.  You can tell they were not dumped in the fryer from a frozen state,  rather formed by detailed and skilled hands and fresh ingredients were used in these little edible purses.   We came in on a weeknight around 6:30pm ( they close at 7pm) and there was a table of three dinning in and mild traffic for take-out.   I can't speak for the bakery items since they were all but gone when we arrived.  A good excuse to go back again!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years to get their pastries (the Macau egg custard, BBQ pork buns and taro twists are some of my favorites), but today was the first time that I stopped in to order food off of the menu.   It was a cold day, so I went for one of their breakfast specials that they were still serving around 11 a.m. I had congee with preserved egg with a side of pot stickers all for around $7. Food came out quickly and the portions were just enough food for me. You can taste that the potstickers are home made and they had a lot of chive. I was a fan of the meal, and they had a solid amount of choices to explore.  The only downside is that the inside is relatively bare and there isn't a lot of seating, but it's worth your time to come in, if not for lunch, then for some of their delicious pastries to go. There aren't a lot of Asian bakeries in the Madison area, and everything tastes fresh here. For how small their operation is, they do have a great variety of things to try. Looking forward to coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Went in to check out this place at about 2pm on a weekday and there was still a good selection. The breads are fresh and yummy. The bakery is located on a corner right off the street with a very odd parking space. Decently priced. I wish they made meat steamed buns!   The taro twist bread was to die for! Definitely will be back for more. Reminds me of the Asian bakeries in Seattle, WA."}
{"text":"This restaurant is to be cherished for it's exotic authenticity.  It's as if a hole in the wall lunch counter was airlifted in from the East Coast or from China.  The food is simple lunchtime fare.  The staff is from Guang Dong.    The interior is just the simple fluorescent light, clean, plain decor that you would expect from a low cost bakery and lunch spot.  There are three tables and some chairs at a lunch counter.   By authentic, I mean that the typical baked good has glittery shredded pork on top or red bean paste.  The meals, all five or six dollars, include beef with bitter melon and Fish fillet with black (fermented) beans and pork intestine.     I predict this place will meet great success and so I look forward to an expanded menu.  Drinks like Pearl Milk Tea and Frozen Green Bean Paste Ice would really make this a snack place to be cherished!    Given it's authenticity and student-oriented pricing, this bakery makes a good fast, cheap alternative to the also-excellent, much more deluxe Ichiban Restaurant further up Park Street.  It is currently open 9 to 7 six days a week and closed on Mondays, contrary to the info listed on Yelp."}
{"text":"This place is so great. I love the egg tarts and BBQ pork buns here. The sesame balls can be a little oily but it's not too bad in my opinion. The other day I came here the lady at the counter told me they have two types of egg tarts: Macau-style and regular. I don't know if this is a new addition to the menu or just a limited time kinda thing. Macau egg tarts are better because they're creamier in taste whereas regular ones are eggier, but this is a personal preference.   They also have meals that are homey in flavor and good in portion. They're not super greasy and MSG laden like some of the other Asian restaurants in town. They're served on styrofoam plates and you take your own silverware and have a shared bottle of Sriracha on a side table, which I don't mind at all since the price is so reasonable.  I like that this place isn't too far away from campus so I don't have to travel that far to get good Asian bake goods. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Ventured off the beaten path for something other than the usual breakfast fare.. definitely weren't disappointed in doing so! The small quaint shop opens at 9am but if you don't mind waiting the plethora of delicious smelling baked breads/asian pastries come piping hot out of the oven and onto the trays about 9:30am.. so we waited we dabbled into a few different options..bbq pork bun..red bean paste bun..asian tamale..coconut twist..fried donut..all this for only two mouthsbut hey..sharing is caring right!?  Come early as we learned the locals who walk to the shop come and buy out in the blink of an eye.. who can blame them! Authentic asian pastries at phenomenal prices.. $1.00-$1.35.. the staff are extremely friendly and more than patient explaining the items and how they're made..they also offer their own personal recommendations of their faves as well.. all in all an enjoyable experience! They also offer hot soups and noodle dishes...maybe next time! CHEERS.. Keep YELPING!"}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place. Been there two times now, and will definitely be going back. The bakery has been fresh both times with a nice selection. Highlights include the coconut roll, \"chinese\" tamale, and the sesame ball. Very worth checking out. Amazing what is coming out of that tiny kitchen!"}
{"text":"Great bakery. Awesome tasty baked goods. Affordable  prices."}
{"text":"Love the egg custard tarts and shrimp fried rice and cheese bread. The bread is warm and very fresh."}
{"text":"Finally, 2014 was an Asian progress in Madison's food world! I'm so grateful to come close to some sort of Asian bakery... Previously, the only options were day- or week- old pastries from Chicago sold in the local Asian marts... :(  Asian sweet bakery is NOT just a bakery, you can get typical chinese food as well. Indeed, when I visit again, it would be mainly for the breakfast food, not the baked goods. The owner and cashier is chinese, and speak chinese and cantonese. I would describe this Asian style as mainly cantonese, due to the presence of congee, sweet top (what I call pineapple bun) and sesame balls.  What's good: Congee with pork Fried dough stick (almost as good as in Asia) Sweet top bun (no filling) Crepes (decent)  Don't bother: Sesame ball (too much dough, weird custard filling inside) Egg tarts (too sweet) Beef brisket noodles (no flavor in the soup or beef :|)   I think they still have improvement for baked goods, but overall I enjoy the congee and fried dough stick, a typical breakfast food in Hong Kong or Asia. Also, the sweet top buns are a treat! I love to heat them up at home, and put in a thick slab of butter after heating the buns! LOVE IT!  P.S. if Asian Sweet Bakery has some Asian desserts.... that would really be a star attraction!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I'm from Cali, and the stuff is totally authentic."}
{"text":"Asian Sweet Bakery is a cute little place that, upon first entering, is nostalgic of home (aka SoCal and Mom's cooking). There's a large display case by the cash register that's full of baked goods I recognize from childhood and jaunts to Santa Ana, and the menu sports a number of things I'm not sure I'd be able to find elsewhere in Madison (without inviting my mother over for a stay).   However, I can't say the warm fuzzies extend to the food itself. The best thing there were the BBQ Pork Buns, which taste like Hawaiian bread filled with small diced pork pieces marinated in the pink stuff us Asians call \"BBQ\". They weren't the steamed buns (i.e. baozi, or bánh bao) I expected, but they were pretty good nonetheless.   The BBQ Pork Fried Rice we got was pretty tasteless, mostly off-white rice, and needed a dousing of soy sauce before either I or my bf would eat it. (Likely the worse fried rice I've had in Madison yet, compared to places like Chang Jiang, Happy Wok, and HyVee.)   We also got BBQ Pork Crepes and the shrimp crepes, which I wanted to like because I loved these back home. But.... Either the filling was scarce or the rice crepe was too thick, or both, but I couldn't really taste anything other than the crepe (which, by the way, isn't the dish's main attraction). They also came with plain old soy sauce instead of the usual fish sauce.... (Luckily, I had fish sauce at home and we had ordered to go. ) Guess I'll have to stick to Saigon Noodles on the weekends for my rice crepe fix.  I'm not sure what my fob parents will think when I take them here next time they're in town--if I take them here. They'll probably be delighted at the variety of things that look like what they're used to, but I'm afraid the taste will be foreign to them."}
{"text":"For Madison, this place was pretty good. I think they give you less for take out but since there's hardly any room to eat inside, thats usually the best option. Everything was good but still looking for something to replace Hong Kong Wok."}
{"text":"Thanks to Asian Sweet Bakery, I no longer need Chicago to get my fix of coconut rolls, BBQ pork bun, custard tarts, or red bean sesame balls. Dare I say it, do I even need donuts anymore? Moreover, their breakfast special and value pricing make me feel good about coming back often.   I basically ordered everything I wanted to try during my first trip here, things I've been missing and craving, like steamed rice crepe with shrimp, rice porridge with fish and preserved egg. The beef and vermicelli noodle soup was good too, just a tad too much gristle. My hope is that they will expand or refresh the menu as business booms. Space is extremely limited, and it felt crowded by the cash register. We had to hover for a table during the Saturday lunch rush, but it's hard to complain when you see a family-owned business selling the stuff you like, doing well.   Service was business-like but pleasant. I was pleased to see a variety of customers from older to younger folks, international students to transplanted locals, blue and white collar workers, with quick turnaround all around. I'm hoping this popularity will translate into a larger space in the future, but it may still be early yet."}
{"text":"This place is a nice addition to the Madison Chinese food scene. I've been coming here since they first opened and I'm glad they have been making steady improvements since they opened. Their selection of buns are pretty good, though I'm not a fan of sweets, so the only items I get from the bakery side is BBQ pork buns, the BBQ pork turnovers, fried bread stick and egg tarts. The BBQ pork bun doesn't have enough filling in them, the flavors are good, but the lack of filling prevents me from ordering them as much as I would like. The BBQ pork turnovers are nice and flakey on the outside, but again, the amount of pork filling is a bit sad, and they are definitely one of the most expensive items in the bakery, especially if you consider the price to food ratio. The fried bread stick is decent, though it's something that's virtually impossible to screw up. I am disappointed that they are cold. The egg tarts are very good, both the regular and macau style ones.  The rest of their menu offerings are priced very reasonably. The portions are fairly large. They have remedied the bland-ness of their broths, so that was nice. The wonton soup has wontons with whole shrimp in them and the flavors are good. I usually get thousand year egg and fish congee with a side of pan fried dumplings. It's definitely a good deal for something like $6.50. They've recently added taro cake and radish cakes to their menu, I've only tried the radish cakes. They're ok, a bit greasy and some days are prepared better than others."}
{"text":"The best. Good service. Fresh and clearly baked in house. Diverse selection. A ton of fun."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall type bakery. A wide variety of Asian baked goods, some great for a light lunch, others for just a sweet treat. All the bread is light and sweet, the kids loved it. Hot dog \"buns\" and \"rainbow\" roll with egg and dried pork, both were gobbled up by the kids. I wish I could have tried more of the treats or explored their actual lunch menu, but feeding four hungry kids quickly was the main priority this trip. I had the curry bun and a sesame bun. Very friendly staff. There is not much room to dine-in, I would guess they do a lot of take out."}
{"text":"I think I am gaining weight from eating too many egg tarts from here.  So happy to finally have an asian bakery in Madison.  Everything is delicious and reasonably priced.  Too bad they don't open until 9, so I can't stop by before work.  Most of the stuff I like sell out by 10am on the weekends!!  And then I'd have to wait until their 1pm batch is made.  So be aware of timing if you have your heart set on one of those delicious egg tarts.  I'm the one buying half a dozen each week :)"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and very good prices. Their coconut rolls are superb. They don't have a menu online or paper menu, I'm assuming they're working on that. So other than that, they're great!"}
{"text":"I went to get a box full of steam buns. She asked if I could wait five minutes (but really around 15 minutes) for a fresh batch. The pork and vegetable steam buns are a favorite and worth the wait. Some days, they'll run out of the steam buns, but if you can check back in an hour or so, things get replenished."}
{"text":"One of our favorite little shops in Madison. A great place for some baked goodies at an affordable price. I like the coconut bread and the egg tarts as well as a couple of others that I'm forgetting at the moment but will update after our next visit. A big part of the positive review is that there are not really any comparable options nearby for Asian baked goodies. However, we also often come here to have lunch as they have some delicious options. I particularly like their fish and eel dishes. If it is a cold day their congee is definitely the way to go.   The place itself is pretty simple and no-frills. There are a handful of tables inside if you want to eat in. For those driving parking is a little bit awkward at the place but there is plenty of street parking nearby."}
{"text":"I like some of food like shrimp crepe but the black bean sauce beef it's horrible !! I co make it better at home. Beef is too thick and chewy !!!! Not the right beef to stir fry!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to the bakery world and Chinese food world in Madison. Its modest appearance should not stop you from trying this new gem on the intersection of South Park and Lakeside.   Asian Sweet Bakery opened in September 6th. I went on the opening day and twice after that, and have seen satisfied with what it offers in each visit.   It serves a wide variety of breads and pastries that are common in Asia, including old school items such as pineapple buns,  char siu buns, egg tarts, to less common things like \"rainbow.\" It will take a long time before you savor all items on their bakery menu. So far everything has been really, really good. Even better than what you can get in Chicago Chinatown.   According to its staff, Asian Sweet Bakery only serves bread freshly made on the same day. You'll be able to get second-day breads at Asia Midway and Garden Asia Market at a discount price, as they all belong to the same owner.   Also note that this place is more than a bakery. It serves Hong Kong style breakfast (bread, congee, and noodle soup) under $5, as well as lunch special at $7 per set.   Cheap, fresh, and delicious. What more can you ask?"}
{"text":"Congee is excellent, the chinese pastries are okay, they have a lot of dough to filling ratio.  Their \"sticky rice tamale\" is solid, I get 1-2 every time I go.  Their wontons are not that good, they fall apart in their hot soup before I even have a chance to eat it.  Fried rice is okay, I would get it again.  I will continue being a repeat customer for their congee and sticky rice tameles."}
{"text":"Sweet!! How have I not known about this place for this long! Chinese pastries! I had long given up on it in Madison but stumbled upon this place on a Yelp search. A little oasis of pastry goodness in Wisconsin. All of the standard fare. Their food is quite good as well. You're going to finish that big plate of food and that pastry. Give into it. It's worth the carbs."}
{"text":"We were surprised to come across an authentic Chinese bakery in Madison. My family is from HK and so our standards are fairly high when it comes to Asian bakeries. My mother said, \"this taste just like the pastries from HK!\"-- and that should say something about the quality and taste of the food here. We have so far sampled the steamed pork and pork/vegetable buns, pineapple bun, swirled coffee cake, and baked pork bun, which were all wonderful!"}
{"text":"After years of waiting, I finally made a visit to the mysterious ASB on Park St.   I couldn't resist trying their beef noodle soup, and that's where the mediocre rating comes from. It was a decent broth, but the noodles and veggies were generally flavorless. I haven't tried the baked goods, but I'm thinking stick to those."}
{"text":"This small Mom and Pop operation serves up real tasty Chinese baked goods! I'm so glad that a place like this opened up in Madison. It's truly authentic and affortable! The buns come in all different shapes and flavors, but they also have a menu of traditional dishes to try as well!"}
{"text":"Limited offerings of Asian pastry. We ordered one snow ball with red bean, and one with nuts.  The texture is too soft,  needs more rice flour.  The moon cake was light and flakey-nice, not too sweet.  Definitely room for improvement and hoping to see more bakery selections down the road!  Hats off to the owner for bringing Asian sweets to Madison!  If you offered Bubble tea, you got it made!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food options are simple, yet very authentic! Their pastries are great, you definitely have to try all of the buns!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and great prices. Pretty authentic place. Fish fillet with black beans was a too salty, but otherwise okay. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Egg tart and pork bun are 5 stars. Other menu items are 3-4 stars, mostly to sweet for me. Very good prices and quick service.    Solid food at solid prices, definitely worth sending staff to go pick up while on a coffee run."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a Chinese breakfast! We also bought two breads to go which only costed two dollars something!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive, asian bakery items. I thought all of the sweet bakery items had a similar taste - not that I'm complaining! You can definitely tell they make these sweets from scratch and with love. I may or may not have made myself sick from eating too many different kinds of goods..."}
{"text":"Best Asian style bread in Madison! Soft and chewy inside with stuffings not too sweet. Love the taro twist so much!"}
{"text":"I love dropping in for a snack here when I'm driving downtown. Their rainbow roll is one of my favorites, but their moon cakes really take the cake so to speak :) I am yet to try their lunch selections but maybe one of these days!!"}
{"text":"There is no other place like this in Madison.    I've been to some amazing Asian bakeries.  There's a whole slew of them in LA with lines out the door, not to mention having spent time in Taiwan where bakeries sell freshly baked custard filled breads at 33 cents.  It would be unfair to compare this place to those places.  When I say there's no other place like this in Madison, I mean that in a complimentary way because I'm so happy that such a place exists in Madison.  I love that there's a place I can order a bowl of thousand year egg congee with pork and it also comes with a bread for less than $5!  Seriously?  This place could mark up their prices by another 50%, and still retain business because they're the only place in Madison that sells Asian bakery items.    Their breakfast combos also comes with choice of coffee or milk tea.  Since I don't drink coffee, I ordered the milk tea, which was not very good.  But I really didn't care because the combo was only $4.50 for plenty of food.    I also got what they call \"Chinese tamales,\" which is glutinous rice steam with peanuts and pork in a banana leaf.  It was tasty and brought back memories of what my grandma would make.  They were out of the bbq pork bun and what I call the pineapple bun when I got there at 4pm on a Sunday.  I was disappointed as those are my favorite, but the ones we did get were very good.  The buns themselves are fluffy and mildly sweet as any good Asian bun ought to be.    Come early as they're popular enough that they run out of variety by the late afternoon."}
{"text":"You will be disappointed if you hold the big city standards (paris baguette, tour les jours from LA/Chicago) but we are in Madison and it's the closest it can get.  The place is fairly small but friendly staff, hong kong egg tart, sausage bun, pork bun was pretty good! Will be back for occasional asian bakery fix."}
{"text":"I haven't tried any of the entrees here because I can't get passed the bakery case every time I come in. Everything is sooo good and the young men who usually work up front are cute and friendly.   Dining area is limited, so I always get my bakery goodies to go, and then I hoard them in my car. The parking lot layout is tiny and bizarre, so I bypass it completely and park down a residential street on the side.  If you see some weirdo lady in a car hoarding baked goods nearby, don't worry, it's just me having a good time."}
{"text":"I really, really want to give this place a better rating, because by far this is one of the most authentic Chinese food place in Madison. I remember all my favorite breakfast and lunch specials back home in Shanghai, and their baked goods selection covers most everything I expect. If there's anyone who wants to know what Chinese people eat, this is the place to be. Also it's quite affordable.  Having said that, the actual taste of the food was so disappointing. I got their fish congee (it taste better than it sounds), a pastry with red bean filling, and a hot milk tea. Usually these types of porridge are very savory, because they're stewed with preserved eggs and ham, and cooked using a meat broth, but what I got here was bland and boring. Maybe they skimped on the preserved eggs, because those things are umami bombs. The bun was mediocre as well - decent filling but kind of small, and the breading of the pastry was a bit dry. I say disappointing not in the sense that it didn't compare to the best I've ever had. It's disappointing because it didn't quite reach a good enough level where I feel satisfied, and I could see that it's almost there...but not quite.  I thought long and hard about whether to cave and bump up my rating for this place in the name of supporting ethnic food, but I couldn't convince myself that the meal I got was worth anything more than an \"A-OK\". No matter what the circumstances, the food must stand for and by itself, and as of right now it's not quite there."}
{"text":"A small place on Park street that begs to be investigated. The smell when you enter the door is very inviting. A varied selection of pastries savory and sweet meets your eye in the case next to the register. We tried 4 different things when we came and bought 7 more to try later. The noodle dish was light and tasty. The shrimp crepes were very simple and tasted simply perfect. The rainbow roll is unusual, delightful to look at and a great combination of flavors. What they described as a Chinese tamale was glutinous rice mixed with meat and beans and wrapped in leaves, very sticky, mild, and tasty. The selection of drinks is small, a cooler with a few items and hot coffee or jasmine tea. I had the hot jasmine milk tea and it was done just right.   I highly recommend checking this place out. The prices are amazing as is the food."}
{"text":"Verdict? Amaze-balls!!!!! My beef brisket noodle was really fresh and savory. Liver congee with fried donut stick was good- great consistency. Gotta have congee with donut! Sesame ball was super chewy and perfectly fried. Chinese \"tamale\" in banana leaf has fresh peanuts, shredded meat and sticky rice- very filling. Even milk tea is yummy. Hong loved his sweet top and egg custard bun. They also have my favorite- bun with hotdog. I was so full I couldn't try it but next time. Pay and order first. Go early to get pastries hot out of the oven. Only negative- small space with few tables."}
{"text":"If only this place was closer!:( I took the 4 from downtown  and arrived here. The service lady was so polite + sweet and immediately greeted me. She was very helpful with both Chinese and American customers, which is not something you can say about all authentic Chinese restaurants.   The restaurant in itself is a small low maintenance joint that serves primarily Cantonese food as well as baked goods. Unlike the Asian restaurants on state street, Asian Sweet Bakery has a low key, authentic charm with very good pricing (large quantity noodle soups for $6ish and breads for $2).   To note, Cantonese food is unlike the Americanized Chinese + Szechuanese food you will find on state street. Asian sweet bakery does not serve stir fry; they have noodle soups, \"crepes\" (aka chow fun nothing like French sweet crepes), fried rice, and baked goods   The soup broths have a bitter savory flavor accompanied with whatever assortment you choose. The baked goods vary from savory to sweet and are often much lighter in density compared to American baked goods, meaning they feel like clouds in your mouth and do not sit like rocks in your tummy.  I ordered the BBQ chow fun and the beef shank wonton noodle soup and then got a coconut bun and \"Chinese tamale\";) to go.   Both dishes really hit the spot because it was such a cold winter day. The noodle soup broth was hot + filling and came with lots of noodle, vegetable, and beef as well. In terms of the BBQ chow fun, the taste is wonderful. I only wish they would add just a little more BBQ pork.  Overall- Authentic off site Cantonese with all the good quality and service money can buy"}
{"text":"Great pork buns and egg tarts. Congee was good as well. Gave 3 stars as I didn't like their noodle soup. Beef in it was super tough and bland.  Service was quick."}
{"text":"3.5-4 stars, rounding up because I want them to do well, as they're a small, probably family owned business. We came here for lunch on a weekend. It is a small, unassuming place, but they definitely sell more than just bakery items. Everything is very reasonably priced ($1-2), but we ended up not getting anything from the bakery section.  We ordered the thousand year egg congee, beef noodle soup, rice crepes with shrimp, hot milk tea, and picked up some cold sweet tea and thai tea (both bottled) from the fridge. The prices here are extremely reasonable, I want to start off with (nothing over $7-8) and everything is very simple and authentic. The milk tea was honestly a bit disappointing, so I would stick to the delicious bottled drinks (it is what it sounds like, I think some tea boiled in milk). You can add in sugar to it to make it more like the type you would expect at a tea shop. The beef noodle soup was definitely not what I was expecting but light and tasty. We ordered it with homemade noodles which ended up being like thin egg noodles. There was napa and delicious thin beef strips, but the broth was light in color and thinner, lighter flavor (I just expected a dark beef noodle soup). The thousand year egg congee was delicious, though. I would definitely have that again; simple and sometimes what you need. The rice crepes that came out were huge (think of the dim sum ones but larger if you've never had them). They're homemade so that's nice and the sauce soaked right in.   Overall, nothing blew my mind, but everything is nice, homey, and authentic so I'll probably be back soon."}
{"text":"I can't believe this is the first time I found this place after being here for almost a year. The food here is authentic and reminds me of all the ethnic food I've been missing. Their prices are extremely reasonable.  I know a lot of people come here solely for the pastries but don't gloss over their lunch food as well. Their thousand egg congee is really great! I also had their beef noodle dish which left me wanting more. I'm definitely going to be coming back here much more to get pastries as well as for a quick bite. I forgot to mention the crepes as well. Just all around really great chinese food!  I'm so happy Madison has a place like that."}
{"text":"I've been there so many times because their bakery offerings can vary each day- get the cheese twists while they are warm- two different types of small custard pie- one traditionally flan like and the other more of like a quiche (Macao style)- both are great. The BBQ pork buns are great- the dough is flaky and soft. Things are still served on paper plates but its worth it. They can make things without MSG on request if you are allergic (like me)."}
{"text":"They have the absolutely best bbq pork buns I've ever had! If you get in at 9am, when they open, the bread is soft, warm, and sweet! When I lived in Madison, I'd stop by once a week with no more than 10$ in my pocket to grab enough to feed my entire family dinner and lunch!"}
{"text":"PROS: Authentic Chinese pastries, inexpensive, friendly staff CONS: Small selection, limited seating  This place will satisfy your Asian pastry cravings with the standard bread with red bean paste, custard buns, egg tarts, mooncakes, etc. Nothing to write home about, but it's a solid spot for a place like Madison."}
{"text":"Fabulous rice rolls! Congee is slightly salty but makes our stomachs feel nice. Radish rice cake is okay. (Jasmine) milk tea reminds me of Taiwan! The price is unbelievably good (e.g. A combo is $6.50 with congee, rice roll, and milk tea)."}
{"text":"They've added chicken curry (and beef curry) buns to their menu, which are pretty good. They also had mini moon cakes! I'm sold."}
{"text":"I went there with my mom. I was surprised by their prices. It was well-worthy. Their bakeries were decent. Just don't expect any server. I'd definitely go to this place again when I'm in town next time."}
{"text":"While traversing the area, my curiosity got the better of me and I found myself in slightly unfamiliar territory.  Clearly, a range of sweet and savory options abound here, but I had someplace to be, and the female asian clerk didn't seem like the patient type either.  I settled on what I thought was a full on savory bun that had visible slices of hot dog protruding from the top area.  My $.99 investment proved to be even more of an adventure when I realized that selected bites of this bread/bun/danish also hid pockets of sweet custard.  Perhaps if it had been slightly warmed instead of refrigerated, the end result may have been ideal, instead of like a dystopian visit to a Shell station somewhere in the Pacific Rim.  No matter, I'll give this place another shot when I have time for a cheap sit down lunch at one of the decidedly \"non-Wisconsin\" sized mini-tables."}
{"text":"I love that this place exists. It's wonderful to be able to enjoy Asian pastries and I'm always happy to stop by and purchase a few buns every once in a while. If I had to mention a few downsides, it would be that parking is a bit inconvenient and that the buns are sometimes cold (avoidable if you know how to pick out the fresher ones though). I've also eaten hot food here twice and they've been totally opposite experiences; the first time was amazing but the second time was amazingly underwhelming. Still, I'll keep coming back to this place for sure. If you don't mind (c)older pastries and you want some variety, stop by nearer to closing time to find packs of assorted buns and pastries at slightly cheaper prices!"}
{"text":"Legit Chinese food (for Madison, anyway!)  They have a surprisingly large menu (compared to the size of the venue) for both breakfast and lunch, and a few tables for eat-in.  As far as the baked goods go, these are also quite good, and extremely inexpensive.  From the bakery I'd recommend staying with the more \"authentic\"selections, since the items that look closest to standard American bakery items are (as others have noted) not as sweet as what you might be expecting.  But for moon cakes, pork buns, egg custards, and whatever you call the meat/rice stuff wrapped up in the leafs, etc-- all that stuff is good!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The baked goods are awesome, not-too-sweet Asian bakery classics with some savory options too. My husband especially loves anything with the sweet top. Taro Twists are probably my favorite. Egg Custard Buns and Tarts are also amazing. It's hard to pick, so usually we get a huge box with a mix of things.  Everything we've tried has been good, and the prices are great! $1-2 for all the baked goods, which are giant. We also finally ate lunch, which was also really good. Again, the prices were very reasonable. We shared two small items and two entrees, bringing half of one home, and it was about $25.  Every time I've gone, the same woman has helped us. She is very friendly and willing to describe items we aren't familiar with and give opinions, which I really appreciate.  Definitely give this place a try if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"This is the only Chinese food place Ive ever eaten at where I dont feel heavy afterward. The wonton soup is light and fresh and ALL of the sweet buns and pork buns are amazing. Can't beat their prices either - Plus they do bubble tea."}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick and very affordable lunch. No frills authentic Chinese food can be found here. I have had some great soups here, sampled most of the baked goods, but my favorite is the fresh rice noodles with sliced beef and peppers. I love the wide, chewy noodles in tasty gravy, they keep me coming back. CiCi, the owner, is so nice and if you are seeking to try new new baked goods she will even throw one to try on the house.   Also, if you are looking for a warm brothy wonton soup or congee for breakfast there is basically no other place in the area!"}
{"text":"This bakery doesn't have as much a selection of dim sum type items, but it helps the cravings in a pinch. Affordable price, friendly staff, and delicious food. Location is a plus - it's about a 15 minute drive from me."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to learn that there's an Asian bakery right outside of downtown Madison (at the intersection of Park and Fish Hatch) so I went to check it out as soon as I could. There's a decent selection here, although it's not as much as you would be used to seeing if you went to a bakery in a Chinatown. You can also sit down (it has a small amount of seating, maybe 10 people in total...?) and eat, which was kind of strange to me, but probably more ordinary to people who haven't been around Chinese bakeries before.  I enjoyed all the food I bought here, but I will say that I would highly suggest eating the food the same day you buy it. If you let it sit for even a day or so, I think it tastes a lot more stale (which is not the bakery's fault in any way).  I really liked this place so check it out if you've been looking for some Chinese bakery food!"}
{"text":"YUM! I need to stop writing this review and get to this bakery right now. The pastries are DELICIOUS! Well worth the stop. Please save some for me though!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food is going down.   Steamed crepe does not taste as good as before. And DON'T order noodle for take out! They didn't separate noodle and soup (who does that!!???), so by the time we reached home, the noodle has soaked up all the soup and became a mess. Also, take-out portion of rice plate shrinks by the week.  I also advice open your box and check the content of your food before leaving when ordering take-out, cuz they have messed up our order twice already."}
{"text":"As a disclaimer, I would have given this place 5 stars if I had not recently come back from a trip to LA where these bakeries are a dime a dozen.  Needless to say, I was extremely excited to see that this bakery had opened and was very happy with the results.  We had cha siu bao, which was very good.  The bun was spot on in my opinion, and the filing was almost right.  We also had both types of custard buns, the smooth one and the crusty one, which were also very tasty.  In addition, I had the wonton noodle soup, which was pretty good.  The broth needed a little more flavor, but the wontons themselves were nice and had a good shrimpy flavor to them.  My husband had the porkchop in pepper sauce, which was a little different from the usual dish you would find ina hongkong cafe, but the sauce was good. All in all, this place is not the best I've ever been to but it is comparable to the asian bakeries you would find in LA.  It really does fill a void when you are feeling homesick :)"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the sketchy exterior and location of Asian Sweet Bakery - I avoided it for years because of the appearance and this was probably one of my greatest mistakes. My friend finally dragged me inside to eat one day and it actually blew my mind.   This is one of the first places that is truly, authentically Chinese. My favorite thing is to order a pork rib crepe (the sauce is delicious, and the meat is so tender) with Chinese century egg and pork congee with a cup of fresh-made, hot soy milk. Makes me feel right at home and so, so delicious!  They also have a wonderful assortment of bakery items - from BBQ pork buns to mochi, coconut toasted buns to sesame balls, this place can definitely satisfy your sweet cravings. Make sure to come early to order egg tarts because they sell out fast!  The restaurant itself is small and simple inside. Things are also served on a paper plate with disposal utensils, which kind of sucks but is also pretty accurate to how some things are served in Asia haha.   So happy to have this place in Madison. A wonderful gem - thank you, Asian Sweet Bakery for making my day always so much sweeter!"}
{"text":"Asian Sweet Bakery is a nice little Asian cafe and bake shop in maybe a not-so-well-known area of Madison, but is worth the trip if only for their buns!  Everything in their glass showcase seems to be housemade and tastes exactly like the type of buns you would get in Asia or in any major China-town area in any big city like NYC.  They're big, fluffy, subtle (but delicious) in flavor, and incredibly inexpensive.  The couple who runs the Bakery is also very sweet so it only adds to the positivity of their already awesome goods.  For actual real savory food when you don't have a sweet tooth - their broths are fantastic.  I would definitely suggest grabbing one of the noodle bowls if you head by this way!  The one time I went, my friend and I ordered the Beef Brisket Noodle Soup and the Salt and Pepper Shrimp and man oh man, I could've drank all of the soup in one gulp.  The individual components were fine on their own, but the broth brought them to a whole new level.  It was beefy and seasoned, and just tasted of what real Chinese food should be.  The Salt and Pepper Shrimp on the other hand was unfortunately not as OK.  I was so thrilled to see they kept the prawns with their heads on, but unfortunately they tasted old, as if they had been cooked earlier or on another day, and then reheated up in a microwave for the meal.  As a result, the flesh was very tough, and not pleasant to eat at all.  This is also one dish where the salt content was just a few levels too high.  I could feel my blood pressure climbing even just from one bite.  That said, you can't go wrong with their baked goods or soups, so dig into those!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this isn't the best Asian bakery I've been to. BUT I'm so happy that we actually have one in Madison, and the food is pretty good. This is a good place to go to if you are craving Asian baked goods or dumplings, but if you're visiting from out of town, this isn't a spot I would recommend.  I've tried quite a few items on the menu, and my favorites are the pork buns and the crepe dumplings. The \"Chinese tamale\", or glutinous rice wrapped in lotus leaf, was probably my least favorite item that I tried. It was pretty bland compared to others I've had elsewhere, and there wasn't much mixed in with the rice. The sesame balls are pretty good, and the chive dumplings are a bit dry, more like potstickers than dumplings.  The service is great; on both occasions that I've been here the lady behind the counter was extremely friendly and attentive. She also gave us tips about what times to come for the freshest bakery items.  There is a small amount of seating, and this is mainly a take-out place, so there's usually seating available. Be careful if you order the tea, they keep the temperature  really high, so it's hard to drink for the first 5 minutes or so.  I'll definitely be back when I'm craving some pork buns!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, quick service, customer friendly, and super cheap! What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place last week and I've already been there twice.  The bakery is fresh, with flaky pastry and delicious fillings.  Try the lotus bean bun, you won't be disappointed.  Their lunch menu is served through closing and you can eat in or take out.  The salt and pepper shrimp was amazing - big juicy shrimp, peppers and onions, perfectly seasoned.  While it was empty on my first visit, the place was packed tonight - with people waiting for one of the four tables to open up.  Go here.  Now."}
{"text":"I haven't tried anything other than the pastries, but they're delicious!  Not to mention ridiculously well-priced!  Only $1 for basically all of the stuff in the display case!  Very good quality and very authentic!"}
{"text":"Recommendation: get the fish fillet and tofu with rice combo, it is absolutely delicious! The portion of fish fillet and tofu is very generous to eat at any time of the day.  Typically, the congee combo is also pretty decent. I had wanted to get the B1 combo, but the cashier misheard and typed in a B2 combo which includes congee and 5 pan-fried pot stickers at $7. We ended up going with the B2 combo and the the pot stickers were crunchy with just the right amount of meat. The fried donut that I got was a bit cold, but it matches and goes well with the fish and preserved egg congee combo.   All in all, I do like coming out to Asian Sweet Bakery to get the usual, occasionally switching for either the eel combo or trying some of the other fresh bakery items in the glass container."}
{"text":"So delicious, I love the coconut puffs so much I get cravings for them, and the lady who is the cashier is super friendly and nice. I love how you can do the whole meal option as well, where you can pick a congee and another menu item. I highly recommend the fish congee."}
{"text":"The food was so good....and the staffs made you feel like home. It has varieties from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Shanghai , Szechuan, you name it and they are all authentic....brought us back childhood memory... Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very traditional Chinese bakery. Just like I used to see in Chinatown growing up in Chicago. Very good sponge cake and other buns. They make almost everything fresh there. So if you go early enough things will still be warm. Sometimes it takes them a while to fill their case though.  But I also like to enjoy there hot breakfast food and lunch items. My favorites are the rice noodle crepes with shrimp. I also really enjoyed the tofu and fish. The tofu was slightly fried and super silky on the inside and sauce was perfect. We've also had the pot stickers and stir fried rice noodles with beef.  They have a small seating area if you stay. Nothing fancy, they serve on paper plates which is fine with me.  The lady at the counter is always very friendly too."}
{"text":"I was starting to think that Madison did not have any authentic Chinese places: this place proved my hypothesis to be false. Take-out Chinese is fine, but sometimes you need the real deal.  There is one caveat to this five-star review: if you have had awesome Chinese food in China, or Chinatown in various large cities, you might not agree with me in giving this place five-stars. I think this place is great for Madison.   I ordered the beef noodle soup with thick rice noodles. You can choose among thin rice noodles, thick rice noodles, and udon noodles. The soup base was bland like it's supposed to be, though it was a little too greasy for my liking. It had beef slices in it and Napa cabbage - definitely a feel good meal. My boyfriend got the Hong Kong style shrimp soup, where the shrimp is wrapped in wonton skin.  We got a few egg custards to go - they tasted like how they should. I didn't think they were too sweet and it still had about eggy taste.   I had the rice dumpling for lunch today (sticky rice with meat wrapped in bamboo leaves). It was a little bland but satisfied my craving for it.   I'm not sure if they make all their baked goods in store. I can't imagine that they would, since their kitchen is kind of small. Also, there's an Asian grocery store nearby, so maybe they get it from there?   I'll definitely be back! The employee there was very nice and motherly."}
{"text":"This review is (mostly) not for their sweet, but for they savory. We stopped by here for dinner one evening and while the bakery shelf looked nice but a little sparse (presumably since it was near the end of the day), what we were really impressed with was their food menu.   The menu lists soup and lunch specials, but they are really served all day. There are real Chinese dishes here, such as Bitter Melon with Beef, and Congee with Pork Liver + Preserved Egg. We got the Bitter Melon, in a pleasantly salty black bean sauce which was nice and tender although the beef was nothing special, and the Beef Tendon Noodle Soup with the wide fresh handmade noodles. They weren't kidding -- the noodles were very wide, very fresh, and very handmade. They do the same thing spaghetti does when you pick it up, except that it's much bigger and made out of rice. Good tendon too.  This is about a 3.5, but since the prices are so good (that big bowl of noodle soup was only 7.00), I'm rounding it up to 4.   Also of note: the mooncakes, when available, are good (especially the one with egg), although a little pricy."}
