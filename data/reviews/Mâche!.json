{"text":"Mâche was a highlight of my Montréal trip. We were searching for a place and decided to take an Urban Spoon recommendation and was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience. The place was well designed, the menu was quiet extensive, and the food was great. I had la boule (parmesan meatball with tomato sauce) and la \"p'tite vie\"(shepards pie with ground beef, corn, and mashed potatoes). Both were great. On top of everything my bill came up to $15.

If you are looking for somewhere easy, nice, but cheap I would check this place out."}
{"text":"Great poutine and tasty smoked meat sandwiches combined with very good, friendly service in a very cool little walk-down basement location.  Worth a stop-in for sure if you're in the area and don't feel like waiting for a half hour at some of the other (many) spots on Rue St-Denis."}
{"text":"Leur pâté chinois était succulent et pas si cher. La portion était parfaite. Pas trop, pas moins, juste parfaite pour remplir comme il faut."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on our last day in Montreal.  The poutine was the best (in our four poutine meals in Montreal), as our shepherd's pies.   Carlo, our host/waiter was extrememly friendly and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Nice, cozy spot for warm comfort food on a cold night. The highlight is any of their variations on shepherd's pie (pâté chinois): my childhood memories of this dish are boring, bland, stodgy, and definitely not something I would order in a restaurant. Forget that: at Mâche!, they somehow make it delicious. And the spicy one is anything but bland. Highly recommended.

I've also had the macaroni and cheese: unremarkable. You can definitely find better versions of this.

Another bonus: the rest of the world hasn't found it yet, so Mâche! is one of the few places on St-Denis with available tables and good food."}
{"text":"I loved the smoked meat poutine (but I wish there had been a bit more of the delicious corned beef). The spicy sausage poutine was the best on the table! Coleslaw was a bit too sweet and creamy for my taste. Small selection of very tasty beer, and amazing desserts. I'll be back to try one of the pâte chinois next time."}
{"text":"Good food and value.  We loved the sausage sandwich and fries.  The poutine with the pork was tasty, but probably would have been better separate  as the pork made the potatoes very soggy. I would go back if it was convenient."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, definite 4+ and great value relative to cost. Server was outstanding. She was short staffed and handling all tables by herself. All the more impressive that our group of 8 was served promptly, correctly, attentively, and with good humor."}
{"text":"Qu'on se le tienne pour dit, ce resto est la place à doggy bag pour le lunch du lendemain! Le portions sont généreuses. C'est une des bonnes place pour du bon \"confort food\"

J'ai goûté aux poutines, au Mac Cochon, et eu des bons commentaire pour le Spicy (Pâté chinois) et il est facile pour les gens d'un groupe d'y trouver son compte. Pour les désert, le choix est limité.

On boit bien, rien d'extravagant en soit. L'endroit est sympa et stylé, service rapide"}
{"text":"Poutine was so yummy, crispy fries with gravy and tasty cheese bites.  Shepherds pie was hi-hum."}
{"text":"Super! Surtout en hiver! Les portions sont généreuses et le personnel est toujours souriant. Par contre, le service n'est pas toujours très rapide."}
{"text":"THE GOOD:  the waitress was very attentive and checked-in with us often.  The ambiance was pleasant enough--perhaps a little more volume on the music to drown out some of the other tables, but fine nonetheless.  The food arrived good and hot.

AREA(S) TO IMPROVE: I had a pulled pork sandwich and it was good... just a tad bit on the too-salty side."}
{"text":"Had a special Poutine there and my partner had the Mac and Cheese. Both were delicious.  The poutine was huge and had a ton of cheese in it.  The mac and cheese was a decent portion.  Would recommand reserving since there aren't a lot of tables.  Very friendly staff, would go back for a cheap and quick diner!"}
{"text":"YUM.

This place is fantastic. Pork, pork, pork and more pork - with some excellent twists!

I've been twice and food has been excellent both times. Their poutine is the best I've had, and on my most recent visit I tried ''le porc'' which, although being slightly heavy on the corn, was delicious. As others have noted, it really did resemble a shepherds pie made with pork!

I already can't wait for my next visit and I know exactly what I'm going to try - 'Le Deluxe' sandwich. Just read the description - 48 hour marinaded BBQ pulled pork,with bacon and caramelised onions - if this doesn't in itself justify a return trip to Montreal, nothing will!

I must add that our server was probably the nicest, friendliest, most genuine waitress I have ever encountered. So friendly, smiley and helpful. We arrived in Mache having walked out, disgusted, from a nearby competitor and our server's friendliness and bubbliness completely changed our moods instantly. She randomly decided not to charge us for my coke, for no apparent reason, and upon overhearing my bf mentioning that it was my birthday, gave us a free dessert of our choice. We went with the double chocolate brownie and it.was.SUPERB. I'm still thinking about it. Easily one of the warmest, gooiest, over the top rich chocolatey marvels I've ever had!!!

Few restaurants are perfect though, and I'm deducting a star from Mache as they couldn't accommodate my request (for my initial choice, le ''New Style'') to substitute sweet potatoes for regular mashed potatoes . The reason being that the dish had been already ''made like that''. That sort of sucks. I don't expect entire meals in restaurants to be pre-made and just waiting to be heated up.

That being said, the bottom line here is that the food tastes great, and the service is unbeatable. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Très bon, pas cher et plus qu'assez pour sentir la bedaine pleine! La place est très accueillante et un décor assez cool(:"}
{"text":"Went to mâche for a quick dinner and was pleasantly surprised with the concept of this restaurant. I just had the pâté chinois (porc) which was great and super filling. The service was great it was a tad pricey but besides that it was great recommend it for a casual dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food is amazing as well.  I had the smoked meat poutine and it has everything you want in a quality poutine: crisp fries, quality cheese curds and tasty gravy."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great dinner at Mâché with my daughter. We are visiting from California and tried the Mac and Cheese and the vegetarian poutine. Food was delicious and service was helpful and very friendly. Nice start to our Quebec experience."}
{"text":"It's a chillax place with an interesting menu.

They r creative and nice, try it out."}
{"text":"Really bad. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and a brownie to my house (I live not even a 4 minute drive away), by the time it arrived the lettuce was soggy, the onions were slimy and not caramelized what so ever. The brownie was drenched in oil that leaked all over the container it was packaged in. To top it off, the fries were dry and the bun was soggy. AWFULL"}
{"text":"Very nice little spot. The french fries were particularly well cooked, the hamburger was big on flavour. The pulled pork was a bit sweet for me, personally, but enjoyed a great dinner, good service and the location. Poutine was pretty good as well, especially considering that their fries were crunchy and well cooked in the first place."}
{"text":"Nice little spot. Had the classic poutine and the pate legumes (something or other), which was quite good and interesting in composition. Fairly large portions. The sangria wasn't bad either. There's decent outdoor seating and pretty friendly staff. We went there for lunch, arriving right when it opened on a Friday. It filled up within an hour of opening, I'm guessing because of Osheaga."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch to fill that craving for a shepherds pie. Not disappointed. Got the vegetarian option and was delicious. I went one step further and opted to get a dessert: pudding au chômeur! With ice cream! Ahhh. Glad my friend recommended this, as I wouldn't have known since it's a small place kinda hidden on St Denis."}
{"text":"We had some friends in from France and we wanted them to enjoy a true Quebecois meal, other than poutine. No one was disappointed in what they had, whether it was the grilled cheese, pâté-chinois (sheppard's pie) or the ragout.

Great food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is a cool, casual, no frills poutinerie - great place to get a pint of beer and get down on some fries covered in gravy and cheese. My wife and I shared a burger and poutine plus some beer. This was by far the cheapest meal we had in Montreal, but this is because I picked mostly mid to high end to dine. Mache and the surrounding restaurants on St Denis are the right places for good and cheap eats."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese is definitely their go to dish. Nice place to eat if you are in the area"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening and there was only ONE server for the whole restaurant which included an inside dining room and a terrasse. Seemed a little inadequate, even though she was a sweetheart and worked very dutifully through her rather broken English. 

*Pate Chinois (le spicy): It's SPICY! I hate when Westernized restaurants call something spicy and it's barely got enough heat to melt one snowflake, but this place is real. There's a little hot chili pepper sticking out of it too which is super cute. The sausage and ground beef is not particularly strongly seasoned but still makes for a tasty savory comforting dish. 
*Ragout de pattes de cochon: The highlight of our meal. There are some very large hearty meatballs, chunks of slow-cooked pork, and carrots & potatoes. The stew broth itself is very thick to the point where it is gelatinous appearing. Tastes SO comforting, like something your French-Canadian grandma would serve you after you've been out chopping wood in the snow all day. The server asked if we wanted bread to go along with this for an extra $1.50 which we agreed. The bread was a small sliced baguette type loaf spread with a light butter, which we happily dunked in the stew and experienced multiple food-gasms as a result. 

For a delicious but very small taste of French-Canadian classics, check out Mache. I'm so coming back for that ragout."}
{"text":"Belle découverte qu'a été ce resto!
Lorsque l'envie vous prend de manger un bon pâté chinois, mais que ça ne vous tente pas d'acheter et de prendre le temps de le faire, courez chez Mâche!

Ils ont plusieurs sortes qui sauront vous surprendre ou sinon essayez le traditionnel steak, blé d'inde, patate hihi
Le mac and cheese était vraiment délicieux. Juste assez fromagé et crémeux !
La poutine y est également excellente et ils ont un bon spécial poutine/bière. Le choix de bières y est quand même intéressant.

C'est probablement le resto idéal si vous avez des amis ou clients qui viennent de l'extérieur et qui veulent découvrir nos plats typiquement québécois. Bonne bouffe, bon service et déco kitsch mais pas trop... vous ne serez pas gênés de les amener là-bas!"}
{"text":"Mon nouveau meilleur ami : Mâche ! 

Le resto le plus Québécois de Montréal ! En effet, ils ont deux items sur le menu : de la poutine, et du pâté chinois. Du FOU-MALADE pâté chinois ! Évidemment, ils ont quelques variantes des dits plats, ce qui ajoute une touche de folie aux plats de nos mamans. Ne sous-estimez pas le pouvoir d'une portion géante de pâté chinois un midi de semaine, alors que la vie universitaire est en train de vous rendre dingue !  Passez chez Mâche, vous verrez que ça met de la mine dans le crayon, c'est moi qui vous le dit ! Prochaine fois j'essaye la poutine ! 

En plus, c'est pas cher. T'as aucune excuse."}
{"text":"The poutine was great. I had the normal poutine, and the cheese curds were still squeaky which is a plus! The smell of smoked pork could be smelled from the outside, and it had me wishing I got the pulled pork poutine instead. The prices for poutine were the most fair I saw during my visit to Montreal. Service was good, and the menu is both in English and French. The interior is very urban and modern, and the location is great, right in the heart of Quartier Latin. I will back when I visit Montreal again."}
{"text":"So. Good. I am very thankful to the many Yelpers who had recommended this location. It was a 25 minute walk on a Friday night with seating both indoors and outdoors. We were greeted and seated promptly and everything we ordered was delicious. The portions are large and I wish we had room for dessert. We had the spicy pâte chinois, the pulled pork poutine and the deluxe sandwich. My father is a professional-grade pulled pork maker so I'm extremely picky with my pork products but I was not disappointed here in the least. Every single bite of that sandwich was amazing and I agree with the other reviewer who said the trip to Montreal is worth it just for that sandwich. I have never had better poutine in my life. I love this place and would eat here every day if I could."}
{"text":"There's a few things that are necessary in life to make a cold winter bearable. A well-made wool sweater is one, hot beverages is another, but one that always hits the spot is comfort food.

Located on St. Denis, Mache serves up Pate Chinois (Quebecois version of Shepherds Pie), Poutine, and other local comfort food.

I tried the \"New Style\" pate, mainly to see how pulled pork faired in this fashion. I must say, it's quite good. The portions were spot on, the pulled pork wasn't over done or dry. I liked how there were leeks in there, to add a bit of different texture in the pate. I think something like celery or even diced carrots would be a welcome addition...something crunchy would've sent this dish to almost perfection.

I'll have to come back to try some of the other interesting fare they have here.

Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Poutine was great, the fries reminded me of New York fries' fries (heh) but I wished it was crispier/fried longer. I got the Quebec poutine (classic one but with spicy sausage) and we shared a mac and cheese which was cheesy, yummy and not your typical elbow pasta!

Our server was great, put up with our French Immersion French and spoke English with us as well. 

Overall really enjoyed their poutine and squeaky cheese curds and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Pour ma dernière soirée à Montréal, mes amis m'ont amené à Mâche! où j'ai pu manger un bon pâté chinois et en dessert, un pudding chômeur.
Un pâté chinois, c'est quoi? c'est un peu comme notre hachis parmentier, mais avec en plus, de la crème de maïs. Bref, c'est bon :) 
J'ai opté pour le plus simple (boeuf, maïs, purée), mais le restau en propose avec différents types de viandes et d'accompagnements, et même un végétarien :)
Leurs poutines sont énoooorme aussi.
Pour le dessert, j'ai découvert donc ce gâteau, dont aucun restau ne propose la même recette selon mes amis, et c'était plutôt bon, avec sa crème glacée :)
La salle est sympa, pas très grande, avec une terrasse pour l'été, les prix pas excessif, et le service rapide et souriant.
Une bonne adresse à Montréal :)!"}
{"text":"Came in late last August and had the Classique along with some Boreale on tap. Food was tasty if very heavy and the beer was great but the service was tops - our waitress seated and served us quickly, my date and I were tired from the long drive and check-in process and she took good care of us and told us to try two different varieties of Boreale (I loved the Red!). The gravy was perfect and the curds were delicious - this was the best poutine that I sampled in Montreal."}
{"text":"OMG....My taste buds where in heaven.  Nice little hidden spot. We wanted to have great Canadian food and the hostel recommended to go there. Beside the famous poutine we also got their mac and cheese and some shredded pork-mashed potato dish. It was all beyond delicious. Cute atmosphere, friendly staff. we wanted to go the next day again but arrived too late from a Quebec City trip :(... Mache will be our first stop next time we are back..."}
{"text":"The food was A-OK, the service was A-OK, prices were reasonable, a solid three stars.

I liked that they had both Boreale beer on tap and a high chair available for small children. I appreciated that the server was willing to speak English with our out-of-town friends.

I disliked that there was a TV in the restaurant. They were showing the food channel and, as the 3-yr old in our group kept commenting, \"ewwww, gross.\" 

I would have liked some vegetables with my meal."}
{"text":"If you want to have a really good Québec meal like our mother did, this is the place.
I choose the meat ball stew and it was almost as good as my mother's stew.

it was an excellent ragout , people with me ate the paté chinois (shepherd pie)   it was excellent too, cheese macaroni was very good too. 

So if you really want to taste good Québécois meal this is the place along with the binnerie Mont-Royal (for the pork beans)!


Si vous voulez goûter un excellent ragout de boulette comme seule nos mère pouvais le faire, celui du Mâche est vraiment excellent !

Presque aussi bon que celui de ma mère !
  
Les pâtés chinois et macaroni au fromage sont très bons selon ceux qui m'accompagnaient !

Si vous voulez savourez un bon repas Québécois c'est un excellent endroit La binnerie Mont-royal est aussi très bon restaurant surtout pour les bines (fèves au lard) !"}
{"text":"Nous avons essayé ce resto avant un spectacle au St-Denis. Le menu y est appétissant et les prix très raisonnables. 

Nous étions trois: l'un de nous a pris le pâte chinois végétarien. La portion était généreuse et bien que je n'y aies pas goûté il avait l'air appétissant.

Une des autres personnes à notre table a pris le burger Gros Beef. Délicieux et juste un peu épicé! Les frites dorées et croustillantes et moelleuses.

Pour ma part, j'ai pris le sandwich Deluxe! WOW! Un sandwich au porc efilloché sans le goût bbq écurement sucré comme on le sert trop souvent aux états-unis (pulled pork). Le pain aussi était délicieux et rappelait un peu le goût des croissants.

Pour dessert, nous avons partagé le pouding chômeur. Simplement exquis!

Heureusement, l'apport calorique n'est pas indiqué sur le menu... Nous y retournerons. Le service était rapide et efficace."}
{"text":"Go there for the poutine. Oh man. Yum.

Me and my sister ordered their poutine (the one with hot dogs and specialty gravy) and then we ordered another! All before we indulged in our burgers. The burgers were good but the poutine is a must. Super delicious and the service was very nice on our stormy winter day!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to try a poutine and best deluxe burger ever! Super nice staff :) Strongly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Poutine was delicious, service was good and got right in. Though the poutine wasn't the best I've ever had so only a 4. Smoked meat sandwich was also quite good."}
{"text":"We wanted to eat poutine, and the Yelp reviews were good, so we came to Mâche!.

The food was good, though if this is good poutine I guess I'm not a fan. We also had shepard's pie, which was quite good, and a grilled cheese (silly but good). Dessert, a fruit cobbler, was also very nice.

The restaurant is right by UQUAM, so it's a very student-y place that feels real cozy real fast. There are groups of friends coming in for beer and poutine sitting back-to-back with couples on dates who are cheek to jowel with single guys with impressive beards and bellies wolfing down poutine. Fun atmosphere.

Our waitress was very nice, but she was the only person on hand to serve a dozen tables so service was slow. Not her fault at all, but management should hire more waitstaff."}
{"text":"Good Pate Chinois (le porc) also known as shepherds pie. Goes well with a dark beer. Was there on a December Tuesday afternoon. Not many people then. The pate chinois was served in a piping hot bowl. Going in I wasn't sure I would be able to finish it myself but it was gone in under 10 mins :P"}
{"text":"I'm always satisfied when I come to this place! Low prices for Delicious meal! The Deluxe and the grosbeef  sandwiches are amazing with full of flavours! As for the poutine I would go for the spicy, it awakens all of your senses!"}
{"text":"Maybe we caught this on an off hour as we were the only ones dining here while other patios were packed. This is one of those times we trusted the Yelpers. 

I had the merguez sandwich that was outstanding. My wife had the mac n cheese which was also very good. 

I guess sometimes you just can't follow the crowd! ;)"}
{"text":"Me and two friends were looking for a place for late supper and we stumbled upon mache. The restaurant was clean and the service was excellent even with a language barrier. Food was all great we had BBP poutine, two pilled pork dishes and the wonton soup and each dish was delicious."}
{"text":"We came here to try our first poutine, and we stayed for the spicy mayo - good stuff! We smartly ordered only one main dish along with the poutine and still couldn't finish everything. The pate chinois aux legumes (vegetarian shepard's pie) was so incredibly delicious. I couldn't figure out where the flavor was coming from but I have to highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Endroit super sympa découvert par hasard en me promenant sur St-Denis. Premièrement on y est accueilli de manière super sympathique et il y a quelque chose de super chaleureux dans la manière dont la carte est montée. J' y ai apprécié le grilled cheese ainsi que la poutine au smoked meat fait sur place. J'ai été tenter par les dessert mais mon estomac ne l'aurait pas supporté. 
À noter que pour les amateurs de pâtés chinois, il y en a plusieurs déclinaison."}
{"text":"We were here for lunch. The place was not crowded. Our waitress was definitely friendly. We got the mac n' cheese & the classic poutine. We thought the food here was just alright. The mac n' cheese is a bit bland. As for the poutine, it wasn't bad but we've had better elsewhere. 

Average food
Generous portion
Excellent service"}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend after finding that every other restaurant on St. Denis was packed on a Friday night. So glad we did.

The place is a bit small, but they also have outdoor seating. We were lucky enough to get the very last table inside. We started with the meatball which was surprisingly delicious. I ordered the Québec poutine and my girlfriend had the ACV grilled cheese. 

The poutine was surprisingly amazing. The fries were nice and crisp, the gravy was a bit spicy for this certain one (but so good), and the cheese was perfectly squeaky. My girlfriend's sandwich was gooey and melty and perfectly toasted on the outside.

We ended up coming back a few days later for our last meal in Montreal. We shared a huge pitcher of sangria, the mac and cheese, and the ACV again. Perfect meal."}
{"text":"Cool little basement spot on St-Denis, perfect for the wandering tourist looking to try out poutine. How was the poutine? I wasn't impressed. Wait, you're in Washington? What do you know about poutine? 

I'm a Quebecois-expat having lived in the US for 7 years. I taught marketing research in college, and asked my students to study the market potential for opening a poutinerie in Pennsylvania (I know - best term project ever!). Whenever I come back home for the holidays, I make a point of trying 1 or 3 poutines a day. I love poutine. 

Yesterday, I stopped at Mache. I normally prefer to try original poutines without all the toppings, but decided to try Mache's Hommage a Quebec - hot dog sausage, spicy sauce (instead of gravy), fries, extra cheese at the bottom. 

The poutine was just as described. 2 full sausage links were added (grilled was a nice touch). The sauce had a tiny kick to it (not spicy by any standard) and the consistency of gravy. The cheese was the standard curds (but cold, certainly not fresh). The fries were excellent, appropriately \"blanchies\". Everything served in a nice bowl, and extra cheese at the bottom. 

It wasn't a bad poutine, and is certainly better than most eateries in the area (e.g. la paryse, mcdonalds !!) but I wasn't amazed. Despite the great service, there are too many poutines to try for me to ever want to go back there. 

And please, only filtered coffee for a little bistro? Get an espresso machine,  nespresso or heck even Keurig. The coffee was gross."}
{"text":"As previous reviewers have said, I don't understand the hype around Mâche. It's overpriced under-portioned QC \"comfort\" food, and by that I mean the kind of stuff you would expect to get in a hospital or school cafeteria.

Sorry, but replacing potato with sweet potato in a pâté chinois does not warrant $15. Giving it 2 stars for the setting only.

Try a better value at the cafeteria on Royal Vic's 3rd floor. Victorian-era architecture included."}
{"text":"We were nervous about eating here because it was lunchtime and there was no one at the restaurant. There were people eating at the other restaurants all along the street. However, we trusted the reviews and got lunch, which I'm sure glad we did.

We ordered a poutine and a meat pie, both very tasty and delicious. The poutine came with little sausages and had a sweeter gravy. The meat pie was rather small, but very filling. Service was quick and helpful."}
{"text":"My son and I had a very nice meal at Maché. I went with Le Porc which is a dish made of pulled pork, ground pork, onions, corn and mushrooms covered with a thick layer of mashed potatoes. My son went with the Mac and Cheese which was made using a 6 cheese mixture and fusilli pasta and bread crumbs. Big thumbs up from the little guy. Although if your kid is used to the Kraft Mac and cheese ( Neon orange variety) and will eat no other, stay away from this more gourmet style. 
If Poutine is your thing, they have some good looking options. Being near the local college, they excel at comfort foods with reasonable pricing. 
We sat outside which is on a small patio with overhead cover. Your immediate neighbors' conversations will be loud and clear, but as long as they're not too obnoxious it wasn't too distracting."}
{"text":"This chill and casual cafe has good food, and friendly staff. Nothing fancy, but the prices are very reasonable, including the beer.  The wife and I both ordered the $11 \"La Grand Pile\": A sandwich with house roasted corned beef, swiss cheese, caramelized onions, pickles, house coleslaw, dijonnaise...fricking flavorful, meaty, and delicious!  The house salad was a perfect sidekick.  Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to try their other tempting greasy editable offerings...Mâche! is great for casual, affordable, and tasty meal."}
{"text":"Great comfort food, quick service and conveniently located in Montreal's Village. We tried the classic Poutine although they offer a few variations-one including pulled pork-the Classic was delicious! For our meals we split shepherd's pie and mac and cheese-delicious!!"}
{"text":"I was with my fiance on St-Denis Street and walked in a Second Cup coffee shop to WiFi my way to a close good spot for lunch, Mache seemed like the perfect choice. 
 
   Seat yourself where you would like and there are Creative ski coat racks to hang the outerwear on. There was a steady stream of happy diners leaving , I overheard the guy say how amazing the Mac and Cheese was, but I wasn't in the mood for the richness. 
 
    The decor in the very small resto seemed appropriate and efficient , the waitress was very nice bilingual and helped answer any questions I had.

  I chose the Hamburger Steak (12$) under \"Les Meals\" its Onions, Garlic, Peas, and House Gravy on top.  It was good a bit too salty for me . I was in the mood for Fries so I upgraded the mashed potatoes for an extra charge(2$). The fries were crispy Golden brown and very good. 
 
   My Fiance had the Burger \"Gros Beef\" (11$), its Beef and Onion Rings, Tomatoes, Lettuce, Ketchup,  Mayo, Fries. He had Up charged the Poutine for Fries ($4 extra).
 It reminded me of a Big Mac for some reason and he ordered the Burger without the Mayo It was tasty delicious and huge I took Pics. 

The Poutine had a great poutine sauce and the cheese was curd standard poutine goodness and it was a nice portion too for a side. 

Great Service, cute place, Good food, and people watching, we left satisfied."}
{"text":"Small and humble Canadian resto. My friend and I started off with onion rings. They were crispy and came with about 6 or 7 of them. I only have one complaint which is the waitress didn't give us a dish to put ketchup to dip the rings in.  Other than that, the rings were perfect. My friend had the pork pate chinois, it was a giant square portion. Delicious! The layers were nicely done. I had the bbq pork sandwich and it had a slightly sweet taste. It was really well done. The portion size didn't seem too large, but in the end I felt really full. Too full. So did my friend. Probably because we had a glass of beer to go with it. 

Service was excellent. Waitress was incredibly attentive. She came to our table to check up on us a few times. Very friendly and warm."}
{"text":"this place is awesome. I had the hamburger steak with mashed potatoes and my husband had the classic poutine. try the maple cola (tastes like root beer) and the pudding chômeur. apple crisp was alright, don't expect too many apples though. am giving it 5 stars because they were playing Red Hot Chili Peppers the whole time."}
{"text":"Toute une surprise pour moi que la découverte de ce resto. Il passe pratiquement inaperçu, mais vaut pourtant le détour. Dans la vague des restos de comfort food, ce resto offre un service sympathique, une déco géniale et une délicieuse poutine à l'effiloché de porc. 
La serveuse nous a fortement conseillé un des nombreux pâté chinois et, bien que c'est la dernière chose dont j'ai envie de manger au resto, je crois bien que je vais m'y risquer la prochaine fois. Car oui il y aura une prochaine fois."}
{"text":"As several others remarked, this restaurant is located in the heart of busy Rue St. Denis but was strangely empty during lunchtime. Our large party was in the mood for Canadian fare. We ordered a various Pate Chinois (shepherd's pie), poutine, and their burger.  The vegetarian pie and their new style. Both were good but a bit heavy.  The poutine a were very good as well.  Unfortunately the burger's texture was over processed and felt too firm. The food deserves 4 stars but we felt they didn't justify the high prices."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on our first day here in Montreal.  Strangely, every restaurant we passed on Rue St. Denis was packed but this one.  Should this have been an omen?  The real question should be why is this place empty?  Ordered something called Le Trio which was kind if like a shephard's pie with a mix of ground meat, pork and veal.  It was quite delicious.  Now, I'm not a fan of poutine unless I'm seriously wasted.  Ordered the smoked meat one.  Wasn't a fan of the corned beef.  However, if I was really drunk, I'd be in euphoria because the fries, sautéed onions and gravy alone were killer.  Service was very friendly and tabs are quite cheap.  This place needs more customers.  It's very good!"}
{"text":"The server at Mache was a real sweetheart. She was kind and generous to everybody - even putting up with bums! I give her major props.

We visited Mache during the Montreal Cirque Fest that closed down and fully occupied Rue St. Dennis. We passed several bustling restaurants and pubs on our way to Mache and we were concerned about getting seated despite having reservations. We were shocked to find that only one other party was seated inside and that there were many open tables.

We ordered wine and white sangria. I recommend passing on both. The wine wasn't very good and the sangria tasted like juice.

We also ordered la pa'tite soupe, poutine (classique) and the le spicy (shepherd's pie). Out of the three, the soup was our favorite. The both was refreshing: a little salty, light, and a hint of bright citrus. The noodles were large squares that flopped on and off of my spoon but would eventually submit to consumption.

The poutine was nearly identical to what we enjoyed earlier in the day at Resto La Banquise except that the fries were just regular. At Mache the fries only served as a base for the toppings whereas at La Banquise, the fries added some contrasting flavor dimensions.

Le Spicy wasn't really that spicy. There was ground beef, corn, and slices of spicy sausage. The sausage wasn't spicy enough - especially when added to the piles of mashed potato - to call the entire dish spicy. I ate the sausage and ground beef and left the rest.

Our take away was that traditional Canadian food is probably better suited to cold months than hot summer evenings. Perhaps we can appreciate it more on a different visit."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I literally came here straight off the 747 bus from the airport after having left on a 6am flight, so needless to say I was starving.

The super sweet waitress helped point me to the best seat with a charger for my phone, and I asked her whether it was too much to order both the poutine and the pate chinois (ok so not only was I hungry but it was also my first ever meal in Montreal so I was going all out OKAY?). She advised that portions were pretty big but I could always take it home. Good point - so I ordered Le Spicy pate chinois and the pulled pork poutine. 

Talk about hitting the spot after an early morning of traveling. Pulled pork poutine was DELICIOUS. This was my first time eating poutine - the gravy was yummy, cheese yummy, and pork/caramelized onion super yummy. The pate was great as well, and the nice waitress even came over to ask whether it was my first time eating it - when I replied yes, she recommended putting ketchup on it. 

I ate half of both (yes, yes, leftover poutine is a sin - too bad) with all my effort. I'm probably going to eat the other half now because writing this has made me hungry again. I did walk all the way over to Jean Talon area afterward so I feel slightly less guilty about my indulgent meal!"}
{"text":"Overall :
Mache! was a perfect lunch on a rainy day.  The food, service, and prices were great and our meal lasted just long enough to pass the storm.  Normally I'd say it's not worth going out of your way for BUT as I mention below, the poutine was enough to knock it up to 5 stars!

Food :
My partner and I split an order of the poutine, which was the single best \"traditional\" poutine we had while in Montreal.  The gravy was perfect and there was just enough cheese.  We both tried the shepherd's pie (which was labeled in a way I think translates to Chinese pie?)  I had the Trio which was so delicious - the meat was spiced perfectly, it didn't need even a pinch of salt.  The potato was enough to compliment the flavor without overwhelming it.  My partner had the vegetarian pie which she really enjoyed.  She commented on the texture and the inclusion of eggplant with skin, and after trying some I'll say it was pretty good.  Boreale on tap isn't uncommon in Montreal, but it was perfect to round out the meal.

Service :
Our waiter was really friendly, moreso than most anyone else who served us in Montreal.  He chatted with us a little near the end and he answered our questions really well, and overall was obviously concerned that we have a good time.

Decor / Price :  
I thought the decor for Mache! was cute.  I really liked the blackboard menu and as I remember there was some really nifty lighting inside on the side wall.  I also want to comment that of everywhere we ate in Montreal this place was the cheapest, for what ended up being a lot of food!"}
{"text":"Came here based on the reviews, Average fare... waitress seemed overwhelmed as she was the only one... maybe a one time try place but not something I would recommend..."}
{"text":"Juste ce qui manquait sur St Denis: un restaurant simple et des plats québécois frais. Pas de prétentions, un décor moderne très réussi, un service parfait et rapide. On ne rate plus sa séance au cinéma.
Les prix sont parfaits, poutines à 6 - 8 dollars, belle quantité. Les émincés de canard sont très réussis, la bière blanche parfaite. Bravo à l'équipe qui se lance, nous la soutiendrons volontiers comme clients :)"}
{"text":"Mâche is a very good place ! 
Food is great, price is correct and it's almost impossible to be hungry after eating one of their poutine. Their new version of a pâté chinois with sweet potatoes is just delicious ! 
The atmosphere is really pleasant and you don't wait too much for your food :)"}
{"text":"Nous avons prit les plats à emporter et nous avons été déçus... Le pâté chinois était bon et les mac&cheese corrects mais tout était simplement passé au micro onde! 
Pas de cuisine, du tout fait à réchauffer. Du micro onde à votre assiette en 10mn."}
{"text":"Wow, so glad we stopped at this place when we visited Montreal.  This place has some LEGIT poutine fries!  I had poutine a few times in our short trip, and this place by far exceeded the others.  I didn't really care for poutine before visiting this place, but my mind is now forever changed.  If I ever came back to Montreal, and hopefully I will sometime, I will definitely revisit this place.

The other stuff on the menu was equally good, but since its been over month since my visit, I can only really remember the poutine."}
{"text":"J'aime les petits restaurants intimes comme ça! C'était une première! Nous avons pris une boulettes à la viande en entrée. Pour le repas j'ai pris le pâté chinois au porc effiloché et mon conjoint à pris le macaroni au fromage full viandes (je ne me souviens plus du nom précis). J'ai adoré mon pâté chinois. Un peu simple comme présentation, mais la portion est généreuse. Pour ce qui est du macaroni...vraiment très bon! Même qu'il en manquait dans l'assiette! On s'est régalé. Toutefois, nous avons trouvé ça dispendieux pour un plat de macaroni + pâté chinois avec une boulette et un petit jus. Nous avons tendance à comparer avec d'autres restaurants. On a quand même beau se dire que c'est du pâté chinois haha! À essayer quand même. Ça vaut le détour et le service est rapide!"}
{"text":"Mache! A small but wonderful resto on St.-Denis, open on Sunday (very important since it seems like Montreal closes on Sunday)... and one place on a short list of places to go if you're a tourist. They offer multiple poutines, which a prior reviewer agrees is something you must try. It's much better than it sounds, especially if you have one of the ones with meat in it. It's like a full meal. Great service. Merci from this \"anglophone\""}
{"text":"had wonton soup and le trio (ground beef, mashed potato, corn, onion, very similar to sheppard pie). it was amazing and the price is very affordable too. 

would definitely pay more visits"}
{"text":"I stopped by at 9:30 on a Monday night and the young woman cleaning up the empty restaurant was nice about it. I got a $6 bowl of poutine and a $4 salad, both of which I enjoyed while sitting in the quiet little dining room. In the end I had to get to-go boxes because there was so much food, and she was nice about that too."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ordered the burger \"le Gros Beef\" and enjoyed everything about our meal except the actual hamburger. The onion rings, cheese, veggies and bun on the burger were delicious, but the meat was so dense, badly seasoned, and processed (think sausage texture) that we both took the patties off and ate what was left on the bun. While the service was good, it was no surprise that the restaurant was empty.    For the entirety of our meal, not a single other customer came in to the restaurant.  Locals had clearly tried the burgers and opted to stay away. Overall a pretty underwhelming visit, I would recommend stopping in for an appetizer (the onion rings were well breaded and juicy), but when it comes to their burgers, there's a McDonalds down the street. The McDonalds burgers are much cheaper, and a lot easier to swallow."}
{"text":"I've tried this place 3 times since it first opened. Every time I've eaten there, I've had a bad experience. But time would pass, and yelp reviews would convince me to give it another chance. But as they say, fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me; fool me thrice and I will write a freakin review on yelp!

Tonight, I had the \"Deluxe\" -- a pulled pork, caramelized onion and bacon sandwich. It came on a large and soft/soggy round bun that was much too large for the filling. There were 2 slices of fatty bacon, a handful of onions and the worst pulled pork I have ever encountered. The meat was completely shredded and tasteless. The texture resembled chicken salad or dog food. 
However, the most shocking was when they charged us 1.50$ for hot sauce! We got a pretty big serving of sambal oelek, but WTF dude? I just wanted a tiny spoonful to give some taste to my meal.
The only redeeming factor is that the fries are pretty good.

TLDR; the food is tasteless and they charge for hot sauce. don't go!"}
{"text":"Two blocks from our hostel, we picked this restaurant for our first official evening dinner in Montreal. On the smaller side, but a great (small) set-in front patio to people watch while eating. 

Our waitress was great! The menu is in French with an English translation under each. We saw another table's plate of a giant square with mashed potatoes on top, and we dove right in to find it on the menu. This place represents the classic Sheppard's Pie (\"Les Pates Chinois\") - 21st century style!

I got the Le \"New\" Style entree on account of seeing mashed sweet potatoes in the menu description. Pulled pork, leaks, corn, and mashed sweet potato layered one atop the other. The pork is marinaded in, well, not exactly sure, other than it was exceptional! I could taste each layer in every bite. I had a few bites of my mother's Le Trio pie and it too was really tasty!

As I'm writing these food reviews from my trip to Montreal, I'm incredibly jealous, yet so thankful to be introduced to these new world tastes, only 12 hours away from home!"}
{"text":"I hate to give this lukewarm reviews, it's a 3.5 star mainly just because I don't like poutine. And I knew that coming in but figured you can't miss this Montreal staple when in town.  We stopped in on a quiet Tuesday afternoon around 4pm, and ordered the smoked meat poutine. The smoked meat was good - soft, and flavorful, the cheese curds were curdy, the fries always good and crispy, and the gravy overall more like a beefy roux sauce. In the end, I just like my fries dry and crispy. Not a fan of curds, gravy or overall saucy food.  My husband enjoyed the house beer, and the coffee was good. This particular area was a busy street of casual places and bars and such and I believe there are plenty poutineries nearby if you want to check out other choices. Marche has plenty of other options of poutine- classic and other forms of meat."}
{"text":"A very charming little restaurant in the midst of Rue Saint-Denis.  Somehow it worked out that two people ate dinner here for under $20! (Our boozey digestif was to be gotten elsewhere, though Mache, of course, also serves beer.)

The food we had here was exactly appropriate for our last night in Montreal - comforting, classic Quebecois. The \"Le Spicy\" pate-chinois ($11) is, for all intents and purposes, Shepherd's Pie. It came straight out of the oven with the ceramic still radiating heat. Under the mashed potato layer was ground beef and corn studded with tiny slices of merguez. Not the prettiest thing to look at, but delicious. The entire time you're eating, you're thinking: \"yummy yummy in my tummy...\" 

We also had the \"a l'effiloche de porc\" poutine (pulled pork), which arrived hot and piled high in a steel bowl. This was on \"happy hour\" special for $7 instead of $9. Compared to our other poutine experiences, it was somewhat more conservative with the cheese curds and VERY liberal with the gravy - every fry down to the bottom was saturated. Somehow this dish stayed hot throughout its time being eaten - thank god because cold gravy is revolting. I might not run the risk of ordering it next time.

Given the nature of the food, the portion sizes are pretty random - a woman sitting near me also ordered a pate chinois and hers was practically rising out of her bowl.  Another table nearby had an order of battered onion rings which looked amazing. (Apparently, filled with potato and meat, I still eye other people's food...)

Service was fine; the two waitresses on the floor were a bit short and frenzied because literally the entire restaurant ordered at the same time. We came at 6pm on a Saturday and just made it before the rush - during our meal, at least 8 parties were turned away because the tables were full.  The dining room can probably sit no more than 45 people total (not including the 4 or 5 outdoor cafe tables). Reservations strongly recommended.

For such a tiny space, they have several large tables and are able (and willing) to accommodate large groups of up to 12. But make that reservation!"}
{"text":"Le paté chinois était bon d'après les commentaires des personnes avec moi.

Le mac and cheese au cochon était sans plus. Pas assez de gout et la viande a été rajouté vulgairement par dessus la macncheese. Cela n'a donc pas cuit ensemble et c'est bien dommage pour le gout ... De plus ce n'était pas des macaronis comme pâtes mais des torsades ... Au final 14$ pour ce macncheese c'est dommage, j'en ai mangé des meilleurs et mieux cuisiné pour moins cher que ca !

Pas emballé au point d'y retourner."}
{"text":"I found this place since it was in close proximity to my area and the reviews were really good so decided to give it a try. I went on a Wednesday evening. The crowd wasn't busy at all and seating was either inside or out. It's all self-seat and kid-friendly too. Please note, the menu is all in French so Google Translate may be helpful. For a starter I went with the cranberry soda and meatball appetizer. It's pretty big so it may be enough for 2 people. It was drenched in tomato sauce and topped with parmesan cheese and parsley for decoration.  It tasted more like turkey meat than ground beef. It was pretty but sadly lacked a bit of flavor. For dinner I went with the hamburger steak with pea-filled mashed potatoes and dark brown gravy. This meal was much better and very yummy. The gravy was my favorite. This restaurant is known for their poutine also, which I noticed a lot of people ordering. I enjoyed my meal and the service and would recommend trying if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Fresh look, yummy menu items, friendly waiters... I am getting hungry thinking about it all over again!

SETTING
-On a street full of lots of little restaurants to eat, it's kinda hard to see since their sign doesn't stand out very much. It's next door to McDonald's so look for that if you're having trouble locating Mâche! 
-Inside is cozy, interior design is great - modern, has both high and low tables, dark and light striped wooden table.
-Has wifi but I believe you have to ask for the password.
-Waitresses were super friendly and helpful. They tipped us off on their happy hour deals.

LE MENU
-We ordered a pitcher of the red \"rousse\" Boréale which complimented really nicely with the rest of our meal.
-POUTINE!! They have a few options to choose from but we ordered the Classique to share among our group. Everything was freshly made so the fries were extra crisp and hot with gravy and cheese curds. This is a good place to eat poutine!
-\"Les Pates Chinois\" - basically the french-candian version of a Shepherd's pie... but BETTER! You get a nice thick square of it and the mashed potatoes are amazing. The top is baked really well but retains the soft texture and moisture on the inside. I ordered the pork \"le porc\" one which included both ground and pulled pork, onions, mushrooms, and corn. The corn was a nice touch to everything.

5 stars for sures. Can't wait for the opportunity to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch spot! Terrific grilled cheese (and just a bit of bacon!), spicy sausage sandwich and wonderful poutine."}
{"text":"Bonne poutine ! Le service  était  bien rapide et efficace  . La serveuse  avait  fait un bon service  à sa clientèle  !"}
{"text":"Miam le burger au porc effiloché ! 

Très bien situé sur la rue Saint-Denis, ce petit établissement propose de la bouffe réconfortante à prix abordable, idéal pour une sortie entre amis ou quand on est trop paresseux pour cuisiner. 

A noter que les frites sont délicieuses... Vraiment très bonnes !"}
{"text":"I took the Hommage to Québec poutine and my friend the pork shepperd pie. We were satisfied but not that much impressed... My poutine had too much sauce and the cheese melted. The fries were good and the portion was excellent. The shepperd pie looked good but not much more... 

I'll go again to try the mac n' cheese!"}
{"text":"I can almost copy word for word the first two paragraphs from Boxan X's review except that I went on a Sunday and there was only 1 customer outside on the terrace and 4 customers inside and also no waiter!  

Asking for recommendations, we tried the classic poutine and the pulled pork shepherd's pie. 

Shepherd's pie was supposedly broiled to have a crispy layer of mashed potato on top...I found it to be dry rather than broiled. There were two types of meat ground pork with \"pulled\" pork which IMO tasted more like roasted ham. They also seemed to have added black fungus which reminded me a bit of Asian flavors though no correlation to \"pâté chinos\" lol. The sauce was soupy and rather thin at the bottom of the bowl. Flavor was mild though not enough to warrant ketchup. Overall, decent. 

Poutine had fries with skin and one fry I ate had some grainy crunch to it...could it be (gasp) sand??? Well that'll boost my immune system :p the fries tasted slightly sweet. Gravy didn't stand out. It was a little on the meh side. It had a $10 promo with a Boreal beer of choice on tap: blonde, rousse or red. 

Then we ordered pouding chomeur which seemed ok but had this weird extra taste to it. You know like when you're cutting onion with a knife and then use it to cut cake? That flavor. This was also meh.

Total bill was $31.62 for average tasting \"Quebec\" fare.  I'd say Mâche! for me was a Meh!"}
{"text":"I feel like the Yelp page for this restaurant is somewhat misleading (not intentionally; just the overall effect of the reviews).  This is a REALLY casual restaurant that feels more like fast food than a real sit-down place.  There are only a few beer and wine selections and no real ambiance to speak of.  There is table service, and the server was very friendly and quick, so that aspect of it was good.  However, the food really left something to be desired.  I really love poutine, and for my first trip to Montreal, I was hoping to have a really good one in the limited time I had in the city.  I ordered the BBP, which seemed to be a slightly different take on the traditional poutine.  It was really underwhelming.  The flavors weren't particularly great (just mediocre) and the whole thing was very mushy in texture.  I'm not sure if that's a thing common to see in poutine in Montreal, but I really prefer it when the fries still have a little bit of crunch and rigidity rather than just a pile of mush."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and had the pulled pork grilled sandwich...it was very moist, tasty and good.   The bread was grilled, but not panini style.    The fries were hand cut and somewhat crispy.

We got a table outside and it was nice watching the people go by ...."}
{"text":"Awesome establishment!

Was visiting the neighborhood for BEB 2013. Heard many great things about the infamous POUTINE FRIES...so I had to give it a go. 

The servers and staff were all very kind and they gladly introduced us to their menu since we were all from California. 


We ordered: 
-Le Trio (ground beef, veal, and pork, onions, celery, corn, mashed potato)
-BBP (ground beef, briased bacon, green peas, cheese, house gravy)
-au \"Smoked meat\" maison (house roasted corned beef, caramelized onions, cheese, house gravy
-le Macaroni Coehon (fusili, 6 cheese sauce, hot dog sausages, merguez, sausages, braised bacon, caramelized onions)

From a first time experience...it was Awesome! There just something about combining cheese curds, gravy, french fries, and a choice of protein. Something about that culinary combination is heavenly. At first...I thought it would be quite easy to replicate at home...but I failed!

Mac and Cheese was delish! I think that was the first order that we completely finished

Overall...service, food, quality, vibe, environment were a PLUS for me!

IF YOUR EVER IN THE MONTREAL AREA...getting POUTINE FRIES IS A MUST!

WELL RECOMMENDED!

UNTIL THEN!! ^-^"}
{"text":"Are you a tourist in Montreal? You gotta try this place before you leave.

This place serves Poutine, a unique French Canadian dish. You got to try it at least once before you leave Quebec. It is French fries, topped with gravy and cheese. It taste better then it sounds."}
{"text":"Poutine excellente et pâté chinois bon, le restaurant tient sa promesse ! De la bonne comfort fois québécoise !"}
{"text":"Comfort food usually comes in mass quantities. And that's the thing. I ordered LE SUPER PILE, and got a regular sized samich. I was expecting something gluttonous. But don't get me wrong, it was awesome nonetheless but if you call your samich the SUPER PILE, it creates the expectations of a huge pile of goodness. Fries are delicious. The onion rings are the onion rings are amazing. Large, thick and so crunchy they dig into your pallet. That's the dream. But they could use some spices in the batter. The Burger was a no go for me. The mixed some stuff in the meat, Burger patties should be ground beef and salt, nothing more. But to each his own. The service was outstanding, deserving of a 25% tip. The place is great, though smallish leaving little room for the said service to get around without butt-bumping into the next table. We will go back when we get the chance."}
{"text":"C'était correct comme place sans plus, le pâté chinois était assez moyen, rien de marquant à vrai dire, je m'attendais à mieux disons."}
{"text":"Une bonne poutine, originale et abordable.  On n'a pas ici des milliers de choix comme ailleurs (seulement 4, si ma mémoire est bonne), mais tout est bon: les frites maison, la sauce, le fromage, et les autres condiments (onions caramélisés, bacon fumé, etc).  La portion est généreuse, servie dans une gamelle en métal qui nous fait désagréablement sentir comme un animal de compagnie (j'imagine que c'est un concept que quelqu'un a dû trouver drôle...).  L'endroit se fait aussi une spécialité du pâté chinois, mais bon, c'est un plat tellement facile à se préparer soi-même que je comprends mal l'intérêt d'aller au resto pour ça..."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some poutine, ordered the Au smoked meat maisson, which is their house made corned beef. I found the fries to be saggy and the corned beef was good but didn't have that many pieces. However, the poutine was huge because their were lots of fries!"}
{"text":"Voici un resto-pub sympathique situé à deux pas du cinéma du Quartier Latin. Dans cette place au décor tendance et conviviale, mais pas «I wanna Be », on y retrouve des plats consistants et réconfortants. La cuisine vous propose des  Burgers, des poutines, des sandwichs, des macaronis très fromagés et même du ragout de pattes de cochon ! 

Le menu fait une place toute particulière aux pâtés chinois. En tout, 6 versions différentes de ce mets québécois célèbres vous seront offertes ici. Je vous suggère d'en choisir un avec de l'effiloché de porc. Pour ma part, j'ai adoré le « Spicy » accompagné d'une bonne bière blonde. Parlant houblon, la sélection de bière est correcte, mais coté vin, on est déçu.

On ne vient pas chez Mâche ! pour manger des plats santés ou pour s'offrir de la grande gastronomie. Mais si on cherche un resto accueillant avec des classiques réinventés, avec un petit coté de renouveau, on est au bon endroit. On vient ici avec ses amis pour s'amuser et s'emplir l'estomac d'une bouffe qui laisse de bons souvenirs."}
{"text":"Great cafe style place and very good food!  We both tried the \"poutine\" which is their versions of Shepards pie! Yum!  I had the traditional with ground beef, corn and mashed potatoes while Gwen had pulled pork, leeks and mashed sweet potatoes!  It would be hard to choose which I liked more
Only reason for the 4 stars- food came out very hot but cooled quickly. Service was great and very friendly!"}
{"text":"Atmosthere- great, chill, unique, welcoming, canadian, you name it.
Food - omg cake with maple syrup! One of the best deserts I have ever eaten (might be the sugar speaking) :) putin delicious & pate chinoise (well layers of corn, beef and mashed potatoes- heaven.

Will for sure come back soon!"}
{"text":"As a Québec native, I was excited at the prospect of going to Mâche. The menu items offer a great selection of Québec favourites, but the results are disappointing.

The traditional pâté chinois (Shepherd's pie) will satisfy, but the pig's-feet stew is a letdown: hard, rubbery meatballs in a bland dish screaming out for a dash of traditional cloves and nutmeg. The pouding chômeur delivers the expected maple sweetness explosion, but the cake itself has a floury, doughy taste. The onion rings are ultra-crispy, but here again their coating is missing... something.

Overall, if Mâche put a bit more flavour in their dishes, they'd have a winner. 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"Came here as our first stop after arriving to Montreal for our weekend getaway. We were craving poutine were many good reviews recommended this place. Upon arrival, this establishment on st Denis street amongst the many restaurants and shops. We were quite impression with the food on other people's table where we were influenced to get the Shepard pie. Of course we ordered the traditional poutine and a side salad. All dishes were so delicious and service was good. Prices are fair and menu has a good variety. 

Being in Montreal, this place set our poutine standard."}
{"text":"My sister and I visited Montreal for her 18th birthday.  On the second night there I took her here (trying to make up for the first night's terrible choice of a restaurant!).  This restaurant was INCREDIBLE.  All we did was split a poutine.  It was a ginormous portion and SO delicious.  They have so many different choices of poutines and delicious sounding sandwiches.  Next time we are in Montreal we will absolutely be visiting here again! GET THE POUTINE! Also great service! Very nice waitress, she told us where to go for a drink afterwards and dancing."}
{"text":"We always love visiting Montreal for good eats, especially poutine. We're from Toronto, and have a lot of choices there, but I still think poutine in Montreal is better. We tried this place and continue to think so! The pulled pork poutine was a perfect combination of ingredients, flavour and size. The ratio of pulled pork, gravy, fries, cheese curds and caramelized onions was perfect. You get a bit of everything with every bite. It also wasn't too salty at all. We also ordered a house coleslaw on the side. Perfectly creamy with just a touch of dill. The vinaigrette cut the grease of the poutine :) My husband and I shared these things and the portion was just perfect. The server was also really nice and sweet and the ambiance was chill and clean. What a positive experience! We will be back :) 

P.S. Everyone else's pics here are nicer than mine, so just reference their's :)"}
{"text":"I came to Montréal by myself and I spent two dinners here during my vacation and I tried the \"le porc\" which is mashed potatoes and pull pork. But the most impressed to me is the poutine with pull pork because I have never tried that at home in California. Different with other poutine, their house gravy has a bit of vinegar so the poutine is not too filing. Their portion is big I barely can finish one bowl. The waitress here was nice, she was willing to communicate with me in English. Overall this is a nice place if you are alone and want to try something Quebec."}
{"text":"A good place to stop if you're on St. Denis and want a good sandwich, fries and a beer."}
{"text":"I came to this place wit a few of my homies, tryina see what's it all bout. Big disappointment

I went fo a dish that's hard to mess up, a good ol poutine with some smoked meat. They gave me a bowl with weird ass onions and crappy smoked meat. Left half my bowl full.

Not comin again and I'd suggest you do same. 

Oh and btw, my homeboy went for a classic \"pate chinois\" and he regretted big time too."}
{"text":"Best pate chinois I've ever had! 

I ordered the \"new\" style which is basically a pate chinois but instead of mashed potato, corn, and ground beef it had mashed sweet potato, corn, and pulled pork. So GOOD! The mashed sweet potato was silky and when I sunk my fork into the layers of goodness, I already knew that it was going to be awesome because I could see the tenderness of the pork bathing in its own juice. 

This \"new\" style is probably the \"best\" style.

I've heard that their poutine is the main attraction but to me, it was good but not mind-blowing. There was too much beer in the gravy and I prefer my fries to be on the softer side when it comes down to poutine.

Overall, the place is very cozy and comforting, just like the food served there. I'd recommend this place for a good time with friends and beers."}
{"text":"I love old-fashioned comfort food so when a mid-April surprise snowfall hit yesterday, I decided I needed my fix. Given I was in the neighborhood I figured it was as good a time as any to try out Mâche! and I'm very glad I did.

Shepherd's Pie (or Pate Chinois in French - can someone please explain to me how Shepherd's Pie, a traditionally Anglo dish made from leftover meat and potatoes and vegetables becomes \"Chinese Pie\", when the Chinese traditionally do not consume potatoes?), like roast beef, fried chicken, roasted chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy is the ultimate in comfort food. There's just something about it that makes you feel warm again. 

I first tried their onion rings, huge, perfectly coated and crispy and very, very filling. I got something like 8 rings but they must have come from giant onions, because I was beginning to wonder if ordering a main was too much.

Mâche! has a few versions of Shepherd's Pie so I decided to try Le Spicy. It came with a fiery, red Thai chilli sticking out of my mashed potatoes so I knew right away I was going to get what I wanted. If you don't like heat, then don't order this.  If on the other hand, you're like me and like a bit of kick to your meals, then by all means, go for it. 

Portions are big and quite filling so I was very happy when the waitress let me know that I can also take it to go. She even packed it into a reusable plastic container for me to take home safely without any risk of spillage or leaks which I really appreciated. I'll probably come back to try out their sangria, meatballs, burgers and sandwiches. Judging from what other people were noshing on around me, it all looked very good."}
{"text":"Un vrai resto de pâtés chinois, du \"confort food\" à son meilleur!
Le service était extraordinaire.
À ne pas manquer."}

{"text":"With the #bombcyclone at our doors - who's not craving a bucket of delicious fried covered under endless layers of cheese, gravy and slow-cooked pulled pork?! Be warned: the portions at Mâche are HUGE (not to say - oversized). Seriously - we were 4 and couldn't finish 3 of them (plus everything else on the menu). Need proof? Check out the vlog at 2.45m for fulls specs of this wild dish https://youtu.be/IkT9bTVpt0o"}
{"text":"We went in a we were the only two customers there (I find it interesting)
I ordered pulled pork sandwich with fries on the side and my boyfriend ordered sweet potato shepherd's pie and we also ordered onion rings on the side. 
Their service was quick, food were cooked right and I personally loved my pulled pork. I tried their shepherds pie and it tasted and it felt hearty and healthy!"}
{"text":"After reading reviews for this restaurant, praising it's 'pâté chinois' and poutine, I decided to give the place a try.

When I got there, I almost missed the sign because it was not very clear. Upon entering, the decor was pretty modern looking but there was not a single person other than the waiter D: This was on a Friday (yesterday) at 2PM.

I got the pulled pork poutine for about 10$. My friends got the 'New Style' pâté chinois and the smoked meat poutine. 

When the food came in, it looked pretty bad, as I couldn't see any pulled pork. I don't discriminate food based on its look so I dug under the gravy and onion to find a brown-yellowish pile of TASTELESS meat. That must have been the worst pulled pork I've tried to this day. The color was off, the flavor was close to nonexistent, and it was kind of dry.

The gravy was pretty standard, nothing special. The cheese curd was portioned just right, but not melted. The fries were crispy but very dry. It contained some potato skin and had a sweet touch. Not my type of fries, cuz fries aren't supposed to be dried out on the inside. The onions were very badly caramelized, so taking everything into account, I consider my meal a total failure.

As for my friends, the one who got the 'New Style' pâté chinois said it tasted funny, in a negative way. As we haven't tasted their take on the traditional paté chinois, it's hard to tell whether it's the mashed sweet potato or something else that ruined the classic dish. 

The other friend, the one who's got the smoked meat poutine, said that the smoked meat was very fat, but in a bad way because the fat hadn't rendered down so he ate lumps of fat in every two bites.

I don't understand the hype of this restaurant, with many people rating it perfectly. I'm not sure where I overlooked, but I've tasted better quebecois food in every part of the island, with this one ranking average at best."}
{"text":"Amazing place! Had Le Porc pate chinois and my friend had New Style. Both were outstanding. This place came recommended by someone at McGill, who said it's an unpretentious place that serves good Québécois food.  She couldn't have been more right. People were friendly, service was great, and the food was excellent. Will definitely return next time I'm back in Montreal."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good place to chow down on some poutine while visiting Montreal. 
If you already don't know, there's A LOT of places!
So based on proximity and reviews, this was the place.
The place was pretty dead when I walked in, it was probably due to the parade that was going to be happening for Montreals 375th.
Although, people were starting to enter not too long after.
The waitress was a sweetheart, super nice.
I had ordered the smoked meat poutine. Two birds with one stone. You need to eat smoked meat and poutine while in Montreal, might as well combine the two.
The portion was pretty good. Well, for me at least. Some people complain that it's too small for what you pay for. I think it's not too bad.. like how much poutine are you actually going to eat until you start hating yourself.
I did like it.. I thought it was pretty good. Although, I'm still on the hunt for my favourite.."}
{"text":"We ordered a dish that was similar to a Shepherd's pie and was excellent.  If you are visiting from the Midwestern US, think of it as a gourmet hot dish.  Great food at a great price, and also located on a great street for evening drinks and walking.  I'd go back again on another visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese was so good! Not the best I've ever had but I'd recommend! The pputine is good too, although the fries were a little too soggy for my taste. I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone whose wanting some good ol' comfort food!"}
{"text":"Menoum menoum. If you are craving Quebec's comfort food, there you have it.  Do not expect to have your fresh veggies nor salad.  At Mâche, it is meant to fill you up with some loooooveee and loads of carbs.  They have a meanass pâté chinois in a variety of different types such as pulled pork, spicy, three meats... the mashed potatoes are creamy, the ratio of ground meat and corn is perfect and the seasoning on point.  The spicy pâté chinois will light a spark in your mouth for sure! Their poutine is heary as well with good greasy fries and a delicious gravy.  And if you are a fan of onion rings, make sure to taste them! They are oh so crunchy and HUGE! Ahhhhhh, i LOVE that place!"}
{"text":"Une bonne adresse pour remplir un petit creux avant le ciné qui est juste à coté , soit avec une poutine ou autre assiette populaire quebecois du genre.."}

{"text":"this charming little diner on st. denis is the perfect spot to slip into while you're dodging panhandlers speaking in french. ;-) just kidding. st. denis is a neat part of town.

this place purports to be comfort food. we went specifically to experience poutine for the first time. i've only had poutine once so i can't exactly say i know if it was authentic or i dunno, decent. it tasted pretty good to me.

i ordered something from the les pates chinois section thinking it'd be some kind of asian thing (the p't v...) specifically. it wasn't. it was more like a shepherd pie: corn, ground beef, mashed potatoes. good though. served piping hot.

their chalkboard menu is pretty cool but for some reason touts sapporo beer. i skipped that suggestion and went with the local draft. the boreale! the rousse (amber?) was REALLY good."}
