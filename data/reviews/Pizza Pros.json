{"text":"Terrible service! I'm staying at the Days Inn on Queen St and this place is featured on the room key cards. When I called to order they assured me delivery would be no problem and my pizza would be here in 40 minutes. It took over an hour and a half and multiple calls to get it here and then when I told the driver to keep his cold pizza he called the store and she said she'd give it to me for a deal at $15. It was supposed to be $11.99. 
She then proceeded to tell me that I ordered from somewhere far away even though this was the number provided on their advertising in the hotel. And if I'm in a hotel how am I expected to know where they are? I'm not familiar with the area. She was basically blaming me for placing an order and expecting it to arrive as promised."}
{"text":"I use to be a regular here until 4 years ago and noticed quality and service slowly being neglected. Being the only halal option for pizza in the area I was upset and switched to other options in the area.

I had a craving for pepperoni pizza and happened to be driving by so I stopped in. Business is obviously slow and I hesitantly placed an order for pizza and wings. 

Pizza was over done and wings were tiny! I gave it 2 stars as one stars get buried by yelp. Can't believe they are still around. Use to love this franchise when they opened in Mississauga"}
{"text":"I have been looking everywhere for a halal and delicious pizza place that I can trust and this place is it. They have nice customer service and have a great location. I love the wings with barbecue sauce and the pizza sauce."}
{"text":"0 stars if I could... 

Every time I've been to this place the total bill changes by few cents, although advertised price remains the same. I checked the taxes on my own and they never add up, like making few cents off extra off everyone. The lady got upset when I requested a receipt, as they won't give one for some reason. One time a family member got really sick for undercooked Wings. What a shame... never going again"}
{"text":"They lack customer service and they lack a washroom. 

Deals are good, however they don't honour certain promotions even though they are advertised. 

Pizza is good however their slow/rude/indifferent customer service will not see repeat business. They seem to be biased via language preference."}
{"text":"Wow finally  a great halal pizza joint... i love the great tasting pizza and especially there wings."}
{"text":"My husband and I had been ordering from this store since 2005 but they've lost us. I moved homes and after refusing to order to the new home (despite it being only 9 minutes away) because someone was too lazy to look it up on google maps, now they're saying that they don't deliver to your door if you live in a condo cause they get fines/lack of parking. Even after I told them that I live in a VERY wealthy neighbourhood/condo that has literally 30 empty parking spaces two steps away at all times and that there are no fines given, they still refused stating it's \"company policy\" (I overheard them talking in Hindi in the back saying \"just make up any excuse\", little do they know that I studied Hindi as an elective in university and despite being a white girl, I can understand all that they say in the background). What BS, seriously. Why charge for delivery if you can't deliver to the door? If I have to get up, put on a coat, lock my door and come downstairs anyways, what's the difference of me just getting it myself? If it were a condo in a dangerous or sketchy neighbourhood, I'd get it. But I live in a multi-million dollar condo surrounded by multi-million dollar homes. This new \"company policy\" is pure BS and they're going to lose customers. Not like the management cares or does anything about it but it's truly sad to see this place go downhill so badly, considering that their food is quite good."}
{"text":"By far not recommended! Ordered food from this place twice.. First time they were two hours late and did not bother to call or even apologize for the delay.. Called and they said they did not have a driver at least notify someone since when you order pizza its normally for a gathering or function.. 

Second time I ordered they keep in almost 3 hours we called twice first time they clearly ignored the call since they knew we had called before.. We called again manager said 10-15 mins another hour almost.. 

Worst place to order and I'm not even someone who complains and then forgot our drinks"}
{"text":"Great Pizza  really nicely done. The plave is a bit shabby but thenfood makes up for it. However we only use ot for take away or delivery as its mot really a sit down place.

Try and order beforehand as it will save time aonce they take 15 mins for the pizza to be ready."}
{"text":"Ordered food for delivery, was told it would take 45-55 minutes, no problem. Called after an hour to ask about my order, and was told the driver was late but the food was ready, and it would be at my door in five minutes, a little irritating, but no big deal. 20 minutes pass and still no pizza. I called again, this time to cancel the order because I'm not waiting  for an hour and a half to get cold food. Fuck that. Then the owner shows up *IN UNDER 5 MINUTES* and starts spewing shit about a discount. Never ordering here again. Glad my dog was with me so he wouldn't come close to the door."}
{"text":"I would actually give this place a NEGATIVE score if it was possible, but they are lucky that Yelp doesn't offer negative. Where should I begin? I have so much to say and complain about. This is one of the worst eatery I have ever been to. I used to order from this place time to time because this was the only decent halal pizza place around that would deliver. Until recently...

I ordered 2 large pizzas one evening for my family and I. I realized later that it was one of the worst decisions I ever made. When the pizza was delivered to our house, I opened it up and checked if the toppings were as I ordered...and of course, they weren't. It's okay because mistakes happen and no one is perfect. I just expect things to be rectified as soon as possible. That isn't too much to ask. 

Once the delivery man left, I called the place to tell them that they had made a mistake and sent me the wrong pizza. To my surprise, the guy working there who took my order told me that I was the one that made that order and the pizzas are correct. WTF? You are telling me that I ordered something when I know I didn't? I understand if it was one topping mix-up but this was the whole 4 toppings that were all off. So, being calm, I began to explain and tell him that I know what I ordered and that this wasn't it. He argued back some more until a point came where he began to raise his voice and fight on the phone with me. All I wanted was for him to take this pizza back and just bring me my pizza I ordered. The phone call yelling/arguing went on for about 15 minutes and he even hung up on me twice. 

In the end, I drove to the store with the pizzas and wanted my money back. Thank goodness that another manager was on duty and agreed to take back the pizzas and give us our money back. 

This is the worst customer relations eatery I have ever been to. The fact that the guy was on the phone yelling at me and arguing shows more than enough.

I really hope this place goes out of business because even when I showed up to get my money back, the manager did not bother to talk to me or fix the situation in any way. If someone is going to have that much pride and arrogance, then they do not know how to run a business. PLEASE GO/ORDER AT YOUR OWN RISK!!"}
{"text":"Quick service, delicious fresh ingredients. No frills place, excellent for take out. Pizza had a healthy amount of toppings and cheese, didn't skimp on anything."}
