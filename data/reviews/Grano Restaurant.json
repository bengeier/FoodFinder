{"text":"We brought my parents here for my Dad's birthday and it was an amazing experience!  Firstly, the service was top notch! The servers were really helpful about the menu choices and they treated my son like he was a little gentleman (he's 5).  Secondly, the menu options were unique and the food was delicious. If you are up for something adventurous try the \"Linguine al nero di sepia\" with squid, octopus, and squid ink...it was so unique and flavourful. But maybe don't have it if you're on a first date because it makes your teeth a bit black. :) The squash and sweet potato gnocchi was also incredible, and the spaghetti in the wine braised venison sauce was very rich and delicious.  The atmosphere was fun and the restaurant is decorated in a rustic Italian fashion. It was a great experience!"}
{"text":"I honestly wanted to love this place however the only good thing about this restaurant was the charming ambiance. We should have been tipped off by the restaurant being completely empty on a Saturday night! The food was horrendous. Possibly the worst restaurant meal I have ever had. The salad dressing was literally olive oil and salt....a lot of salt. The grilled peaches tasted like meat as they had clearly been cooked on the same grill. The pasta sauce was terrible. Very bland except for the overwhelming flavour of onions. Given some of the good reviews on here, I sincerely hope they were just having a bad night but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great place to lunch with clients, I've been several times and really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I had my wedding rehearsal dinner at Grano this past January (2012) and was really impressed with everything. It's always tricky when making reservations for a large group (there were 16 of us). I worked with the manager Roberto on a prix fixe menu so we didn't have to worry about ordering and everything could come out at the same time (family style). He asked for a picture of us and printed out the custom menu and had it set out at each place setting - a very nice touch.  We had the back room which was nice and private. We also had a toddler and a baby with us so they could walk around the space and not disturb any other patrons. It was also nice an intimate for when we made speeches.   The food was delicious and the timing of when everything came out was perfect. They even threw in a few extras for free - great value. The service was also impeccable. I highly recommend Grano for a large group."}
{"text":"Went to dinner to celebrate a friend's wedding anniversary and they've been to Grano before and wanted to go.    We decided to order a bunch of things and share between the 4 of us and so we ordered a number of Antipasta, grilled calamari, rapini, penne with tomato sauce and a bottle of Riesling.    First off, the service is wonderful.  The owner asked how our meal was and my friend remarked that the calamari was not what she remembered it to be from before and he told us that he'd get us a new order without the salad as it can be served in a different way.  Either way it was served, it tasted the same (grilled in a reduced balsamic vinegar sauce) but my friend seemed convinced that the recipe isn't the same.    The antipasta was a selection of items that had its average and better than average items.  The penne with tomato sauce is basically that, pasta with basic tomato sauce.     Grano has been established so long that they're obviously doing something right for the majority of their customers so they're not about to fix something that's not broken.  Food isn't exciting but there are no surprises and maybe that's ok for most people.  Nothing wrong with that."}
{"text":"First time we attempted to come to this place (recommended by a friend), it was closed for a private function.  On a second attempt, it was closed for lunch on a Saturday. When we finally got in for a dinner on a Saturday night, I ordered chicken.  After a while the owner came by and apologetically told us that they ran out of chicken.  Seriously?!?!?  They did bring us a glass of complimentary wine though.  I was driving and really didn't need another glass of wine. Fine, I ordered lamb instead of chicken from the limited menu.  It was the worst lamb I ever had:  tough, under cooked and definitely not worth almost $30! Needless to say I am extremely underwhelmed by this overpriced restaurant that looks like it hasn't been renovated in many years. Oh, by the way, a bottle of mineral water was almost $10!"}
{"text":"I admit I'm giving five stars to juice the average a little. Yes, the prices are on the high side. But Grano is a Toronto phenomenon for a reason. The management is very engaged and in my experience the staff are friendly and efficient. The ambience is special, and the unfinished look definitely part of the charm. Absolutely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Came here with friends on vacation for my daughter's birthday.  The food was excellent.  Together, we had at least 5 different dishes and everyone was very satisfied. Nice ambience.  Made me a little nervous at first since it wasn't full, but it was great.  They also made a special cake with candle for my daughter."}
{"text":"I had a terrific time at Grano with a group. The food was delicious and the service great. Every single one of my 6 person party enjoyed our appetizers, mains, wine, and dessert. Authentic Italian food and excellent flavour combinations. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"NO FOOD ON A MENU ...ORDERED LAMB CHOPS AFTER 15 MIN WAS INFORMED \"SORRY WE DO NOT HAVE\" CHANGED TO CHICKEN AND HAPPEN SAME STORY...ONLY CHEAP PASTA LEFT...OWNER DOESN'T CARE  Service is very slow and bad."}
{"text":"Dinner Take out   Ambience: 4/5   Food: 3/5  Service: 3/5 (Friendly) Value: 3/5  Repeat: Not sure"}
{"text":"The decor was charming, giving off an old Italian fashion vibe with lots of art pieces over the walls scaling up it's high ceiling.      The Calamari was bland, it was cooked tender without excess batter.  It really needs some better seasoning, not to mention it didn't come with any sort of dipping sauce!  I also had the Linguine Al Nero Di Sepia, which is a seafood dish consisting of spaghetti noddles with squid and octopus - but with squid ink as it's sauce.  Despite it's looks, it tasted good, however the black ink leaves your teeth looking an Orc from Lord of the Rings.    It's disappointing that half the stuff on the dessert menu were gone by 10pm on a Saturday night.  Overall, the staff was friendly and the food was decent."}
{"text":"love this place so much. food and service great aswell as intimate atmosphere"}
{"text":"One of the best and most authentic Italian restaurants in Toronto. It is NOT a pizzeria so don't think you'll find any here. This is the type of place to get amazing calamari and octopus salad, prepared fresh, and really tasty pasta dishes. I have eaten practically everything on the menu over many years, and have always enjoyed my meal.   The last time I went was with a party, some highlights were the crispelle with ricotta, which were as good as any I've eaten in tuscany, and the rare steak with vegetables.   The wine list is reasonable without being overwhelming. It features a lot of great Tuscans and they also bring in many interesting Italian wines from small producers. They feature a number of Canadian wines as well, which is always good to see.   The coffee is fantastic, can be served in vetro. The tiramisu is wonderful.  Ambiance here is rustic and cozy, the wait staff is friendly, attentive and fast. This is a relaxed, classic Italian trattoria."}
{"text":"Love this authentic mediterranean restaurant. Everything about Grano is divine: decor, menu choices, quality of cuisine, welcoming atmosphere. Focaccia ( no charge) on seating.   Great antipasto bar. Generous portions. Reasonably priced. Tempting desserts. Great coffees. Makes you feel like you are in Italy. Great patio in the back.  You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Grano is a fantastic family run restaurant. Italina food with fine wines and beer on tap.   Fun art on the walls and funky cool decor.  We hold our school fund raiser there and it is superb venue for a large party. the outdoor patio is lovely in the summer."}
{"text":"Trash. Always has been always will be. Absolute bottom of the barrel cooking. Do not go here. Poor food handling and low quality ingredients do not equal value. Sloppy everything that worked in the early '90s. Not any more. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday gathering.   Good * the service is great * They have a private room for parties * There is no selling or pushiness to order *They have an extensive wine list and the desserts are great! (Esp tiramisu)  Poor *They charged 20% grats instead of the 18% advertised and agreed upon *Food left something to be desired. Calamari was not seasoned enough (though crispy) *The prices they charge isn't worth the amount and quality of food you get. Nothing innovative about my chicken, just 4 timbit sized pieces of dry chicken and it was 26 dollars.  *Squid ink pasta was something I was excited to try because of previous experiences but this one was bland.  * their special was braised veal and it was so small it could have been an appetizer.  All in all it was definitely not worth the money especially when they are located in an area with much better restaurants in terms of quality and quantity.   Also when called ahead of time to make reservations, they offered to do something special for the birthday girls and then charged the desserts to their bills. After bringing it up, 1 of them was comped. After ordering almost $100 worth of food and wine, it was a bitter way to end the meal."}
{"text":"I heard many great things about this restaurant. On various occasions this place was suggested but always seem to be avoided until now. I went on a Friday night and upon entering I found this establishment to be nicely decorated and had the feel of an old Italian village.   I was seated in the back corner that has a window ceiling by all the plants. The table was sticky and wobbly as was my chair. The plants were very invasive to my head space.   When the food came it was okay. Not great but not bland. I ordered the twisty tube pasta with calf liver and it was actually quite tasty. On the other hand the egg noodle and meatball was not tasty at all. It tasted like they opened up a can of chef boyardee and served it on a plate. Not great at all. For dessert I had the gelato which someone insisted was the best they'd ever had; I have to disagree. The mango was extremely mango-ey but the raspberry offset it but still it was an extremely overwhelming flavour.   All in all I wasn't impressed with much of anything. The waitress took forever on everything. She looked bored with life and the world and on top of everything, I got a mosquito bite on my ankle from sitting by the plants. Thanks..."}
{"text":"Nice spot.  I'd go back due to the friendly service and good food.  If you're not looking for something up to date and remodeled.  It's clearly a family run joint.  I'm no snob when it comes to interior as long as it's clean.  It was quiet in the dining area, even though there was a large group with kids in the party room off to the side.  We had a nice intimate meal.  Appetizer was perfect for two, pasta dishes weren't alarmingly huge, which is different for an Italian place.  Dessert was ok, I'd go with the classic, tiramisu next time."}
{"text":"I wish I could give multiple star ratings for Grano.  That's because my experience with Grano was one of extremes.  The atmosphere is first-rate, especially the two cozy patios in the back.  The food was very good as well.  So I'd give Grano a good rating based on that.  But the service?  Terrible.  We ordered two glasses of house white wine with our appetizer.  The wine never came.  We asked about it and were told the wine was coming.  Another ten minutes--nothing.  Finally it came, but the same thing happened for our main course.  We ordered (at the very beginning, when we ordered our appetizers) a bottle of wine with our main course.  The food came, but no wine.  Finally one server asked if we wanted wine with dinner and I said \"Yes, I ordered it ages ago and it never came.\"  So he went to look into it.  Another server came and asked if we needed anything.  \"The wine.\"  She stomped off to look into it.  More time passed.  Still nothing.  Finally our original server came by and asked if we needed anything.  I said \"I originally placed my order with you nearly an hour ago asking for a bottle of wine with dinner.  Then another server asked.  Then yet another.  Now you're asking again.  In other words I've asked for a bottle of wine FOUR times and still nothing.\"  Eventually the gruff server came by with the wine and was incredibly rude and dismissive.  As if to say I was unreasonable by being frustrated asking for the same bottle of wine four times over.  So I doubt I'll visit Grano again.  The atmosphere and food were very good, but the service was abysmal."}
{"text":"The food was right. We ordered squid ink spaghetti and squash and sweet potato gnocchi.   The service was friendly. We had four different servers but all are very attentive.   For the price, I find that I can find better Italian restaurant in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a delicious meal at Grano last night for Yelper Amanda D.'s graduation party. The party was set up in the back of the restaurant. An aesthetically pleasing patio made out of stone, I was able to relax in the midst of the city while listening to the pouring of the water of the fountain. I felt like I was in Italy!   The service was excellent. Our server was quick to come with more wine or water; he also cleared our plates as soon as we were finished.   The food was great!  Salad with Vinaigrette - It was good, but you can't really go wrong here. Even a culinary genius could make a delicious salad.  Gnocchi with Tomato Sauce - There was a good balance of sauce and pasta. I liked it!  Chicken with Grilled Veggies - The chicken was not dry at all, with melted cheese inside. Veggies were good.  White Chocolate Pie - Amazing!   We ended the night with lattes or espresso.   I'll definitely be back.  Maybe even for just dessert and coffee."}
{"text":"Not amazing. Definitely over priced for the level of service and atmosphere. There are better Italian places for about same price or less in the same area."}
{"text":"I had never been to Grano before but went recently for lunch with friends. The restaurant is cute inside. It gives the feelin of an old world Italian trattoria, however it smelled like someone's basement. It took a while to adjust to the scent.   Service was on-point: very friendly and timely.  For my meal, I had the Insalta Mista. It was very good: a mesculin mix of greens, seasonal fruits and a light, tasty vinaigrette The portion size was ample, too.  As a main, I had a ravioli dish, that I don't see on the online menu. IT WAS AWFUL. It was a cheese ravioli in a cream sauce with nutmeg and walnuts (I think spinach too).  It was flavourless but worst of all, I'm absolutely certain that the pasta was store-bought., like Olivieri. It was horrible and I was insulted that they would serve me, or any customer such gastronomic crap. Italian restaurants in Toronto are a dime a dozen so they really have to be good to stand out. Can't say that my meal compels me to return to Grano."}
{"text":"The perfect escape to Italy in the city. I have been going to Grano for years now, and have even taken their Italian course offered in the evenings over a glass of wine and pasta. Grano is truly one of the most authentic Italian experiences in the city. And it isn't just a restaurant with delicious dishes, great wine and a beautiful atmosphere, it is a cultural hub in Toronto. Owner Roberto Martella hosts a number of cultural events and gatherings at Grano, many of which I have attended and thoroughly enjoyed. Grano is certainly among the finest Italian spots in Toronto and one I highly recommend to anyone with an appreciation for an old world sensibility."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place!    Let me start with the staff - definitely what differentiates this place from most other restaurants.  Everyone is not only friendly, but also interesting - it seems that every person has something fun going on.  There are aspiring writers, musicians, pilots, singers, and poets on staff, and they are more than happy to share the latest about what's going on in the arts scene.  The events - I came here for a 3 course dinner and poetry reading.  Definitely value for $.  They have little events like this periodically.  And of course the food - fantastic.  Great gourmet pizza with fresh toppings, fresh pasta, and good quality ingredients all round.  I even enjoyed the calamari (and I HATE squid).    To sum up - GO HERE (and if you do, ask Collette to hook you up with the \"special\" olive oil)!"}
{"text":"Friends birthday party. Reservations at 7 and didn't finish until 11 with dessert. $48 set menu  They had a couple of app pizzas served as we waited.  Bread, salad, calamari, pasta pesto and pasta tomato of some form, chicken with bacon and dessert (gelato)  Highlights - waitress was friendly and attentive. Best part was the mango gelato. So friggen good. It was worth the wait. They came out with 4 different flavours: chocolate, hazelnut, mango and vanilla. The pesto pasta was delicious!  There was an hour wait between the pasta and chicken which I didn't understand. So that was kind of annoying since everything else came out relatively quick.   Good ambience. I probably wouldn't go back for the set menu since it does take long but perhaps for the homemade pasta and gelato.   Times are always long when you're with a big party. Overall not bad."}
{"text":"We have been going here for ages and have held family events as well. The decor is rustic and authentically Italian and in the summer, the back patio has an awesome fountain too! It totally feels like you're back in Italy! Love the staff- have never had less than mediocre service, and just can't get enough of this place. The front has a gelato bar, antipasti, fresh homemade breads, a plasma screen playing Italian movies (on silent), and other yummy Italian food products lining the walkway.   I have tried almost everything on the menu and recommend it all. However 9 times out of 10 I have to have their grilled calamari in a spicy balsamic marinade. Their pasta dishes are also good- like the tortiglioni bolognese bianco, the 'ca punti pugliese, and their risotto and ravioli which change daily. The meal is always nicely finished off with an espresso and biscotti... definitely go for their crostata tri-colore, a white chocolate, pistachio and raspberry square!! delish!!  But perhaps, as amazing as the food is, it's the people there that keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Telus Tuesday Specials Restaurant #4   Back in the days.. my dating days.. I been to Grano numerous of time! It still looks and feel the same as I remembered... even the menu is really similar.   I have to give Grano credits for preserving the restaurant with this Old World' Italian charm.. the fact is, it will never go out of style even if I come back 30 years later...   Here our hostess and waitresses have learn the skills of communications without saying a word... bread was just dumped on our tables and we sort of just start to eat them..Waitress just took our order in silent with minimum acknowledgement...(I can see connection between Italian and Chinese waitresses this evening!)   italia mia (prosciutto di Parma & bufala, warm olives) $13  - Prosciutto so tender and flavoured... I was making the annoying \"hmmm\" sound which drove my vegetarian dinner mate crazy!  - Buffalo Mozzarella tasted so good too.. I ended up sharing that..when my dinner mate screamed \"I am so hungry! I want cheese cheese cheese!\" to me!   strascinate barese (Pugliese pasta, smoked duck breast, truffled oyster & portobello in porcini & wine sauce) $17  - I really did not enjoy that! Not much flavour but saltiness...  - the shredded duck meat was chewy..and tough...  - ended up I kept drinking water till my waitress brought leave our own bottle so I can drink as much as I want!   torta di fango (rich dark chocolate mud pie with bourbon served with a white sauce) $8  - dessert saved my dinner.. as I indulging on this chuck of pure dark chocolate heaven...  - rich and so creamy..and I just could not finish that!   It was a nice Italian feast with my lovely date. I love how the Grano has this extreme noisy dining atmosphere. We were yelling at each other in order to be heard (I want to yell at her for the longest time!) or we have to lean really close to each other in order to be understood..."}
