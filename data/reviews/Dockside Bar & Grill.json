{"text":"I love the setting because it is one of a kind in Calgary never mind Chestermere. It makes me feel like I am on a summer holiday.  I have been quite a few times because my family gets on the lake as much as possible. Each time the staff are quick with a greeting and the service has always been very timely. I typically only go when the weather is hot so it is usually quite busy. I find that if a restaurant feels and looks clean then it gives me more confidence that the food will be good. On each visit we have found this to be true for the Landing.  The menu has a wide enough selection of options to keep us from getting tired of it and so far everything has been excellent. Plus the beer is really cold which makes me happy."}
{"text":"Terrible service they should stick to selling boats they are clueless about customer service. Need new management great place for a drink that's about it food is not good!"}
{"text":"We had drinks and dinner. I had a bacon and blue cheese burger. My fiance had a Tai pad noodle. We also had ceaser salad.  Everything was amazing. The ceaser was just amazing. It came with warm foccaci bread. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. The service was also great."}
{"text":"Generic menu (salads, burgers, and steak). Highly over priced steak for the quality of the cut and meal. The foods ok here. The restaurants at a nice spot with a great view of the lake. Make sure you walk all the way to side of the restaurant and sit by the bay window.  Looks like there was only one server for the whole restaurant during lunch. Props to the lady giving us good service."}
{"text":"I'm there now,patties day.  I'm drinking beer but standing at the bar.  This bartender is so obvious pouring 3/4 oz drinks to the others makes me like my beer"}
{"text":"Just got a bad vibe about this place glad something replace the old Landing nice to have something close to home. Been in about 3 times now most part found the menu to be generic, service is hit and miss. Waiting on our food every time we been in we have under cooked, burnt, SLOW!   Management needs a overhaul! Had a great waitress she was friendly but heard her get in trouble because our burger was burnt and it took forever to come to the table. She apologized for the delay we told her sorry we complained it was not her fault it was burnt; she not cooking it.  Grown up mac and cheese was very good & deep fried pickles were delicious."}
{"text":"In Calgary? Take the 10 min drive out here! Sit on the patio and unholy the water sports!!"}
{"text":"Overall, I really enjoyed my first experience at the Dockside. I'll definitely go back as it's a great spot to meet up with friends who live in the area. Overlooking the lake in Chestermere, I felt like I was far away from the hustle and bustle of Calgary, watching people pull up to the dock with their boats and hop off to have a drink.  The food was pretty decent pub fare, reasonably priced with large portions. Good beer and cocktail selection and the service was good too."}
{"text":"Management has got to change. Everything here is great, the food and atmosphere is pretty good.  The service could be better. I have been there a few times and a girl claiming to be the \"manager\" has had too much to drink and was being obnoxious and treating her staff like garbage - I really hope she isn't the manager as I've seen this a few times.  Have been in with friends and by myself and the bearded bartender is great, seems to be the only one trying to give good service.  Overall I will keep coming back and hope they overhaul the servers and management soon."}
{"text":"Great little outdoor patio on the lake service was a little slow and start Wednesday got going it was great food is good that Mr. is great would recommend it to anybody"}
{"text":"A few days ago we drove by the old Chestermere Landing restaurant and noticed lots of cars in the parking lot. Turns out the place has finally reopened, after being closed for a few years. Its new incarnation, the Dockside Bar & Grill has a totally redone interior with modern finishings and furniture.  I stopped in yesterday for a brief drink and appetizer to get  a feel for the new place.  While the layout appears to be largely the same as before, they really did a nice job updating it.   There were a few other people there in addition to myself on a Sunday afternoon. It's a self seating kinda place, so I planted myself at the bar.  They have a few different beers on tap, plus many more in the bottle. I was pleasantly surprised to see Village Brewery Blacksmith IPA on tap, so had the bartender pour me one of those to get started.  Their menu has a tasty sounding variety of appetizers, salads and mains on it, but since I was just looking for a snack this visit I opted for the pint of bacon! Bacon and an IPA....sounded like a good combo to  me. While I was expecting the bacon to come out in a pint glass, instead it arrived in short order on a nice while rectangular plate on top of some mixed greens, with a side of creamy chipotle dressing.  The bacon (8-9 pieces I think) was done perfectly to my liking, crispy on the edges but still a bit meaty and chewy. While I not sure the dressing is really needed, it was nice to dip the bacon in it for a tangy little bite.  It got me to thinking however....what would go good with bacon?  For me at least,  a nice little cup of creamy mac and cheese sounded good, so maybe next time I go in I'll ask if they can do that as I recall seeing a mac and cheese entr√©e on the menu.    Overall I thought the service and food was good. I will definitely go again and try other food options so I have a better sense of the place.  But It's nice to have this option available again in Chestermere and so far I think it's definitely worth a stop. The location is great....right on the lake and I'm sure next summer when the patio opens they will be doing great business, so long as the service and quality is there. They are also planning on opening another portion of the building as the Dockside Diner, which will be a family venue, which is a nice option for those wishing to go there with their kids.  One other thing to note - their Facebook page notes that they kept the recipes and pizza oven for the pizza place that was formerly in the building (Jovan's), and they offer a full range of pizza's as part of the menu. As I recall, Jovan's Pizza was really good, so hopefully this carries through in the new Dockside restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is great for groups, has a warm atmosphere and the owners are really nice. Food is decent to pretty good pub food. In the summer the patio is the place to be. Great Lake view. Service is a little slow but the atmosphere is worth it. Rent a paddle board and come back for lunch :) perfect summer. Winter has a great outdoor rink out front and after a skate a specialty coffee or beer is order.  Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Excellent first visit here.  We came for wings - excellent!!!  Service was AWESOME!  The bartender came out and served us right away - and the waitress stopped over to chat after she had some time...highly recommend it!!!"}
