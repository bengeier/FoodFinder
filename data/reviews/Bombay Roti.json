{"text":"The service is great, the food is not. Taste wise, the food is tasty, however i ordered the butter chicken and i saw them in the back microwaving the chicken in a plastic container. No thanks. I would go back because the guy at the front was polite and fast but the idea of microwaving food in plastic just isn't for me."}
{"text":"The food was great, it's a different concept, where they have salad bowls with indian dishes, must try."}
{"text":"Bombay Rotii is a new place in the Steeles & Dufferin area.  They are trying something new, and are a non-traditional Indian food place.  The concept is similar to z-teca or chipotle with the burrito bowls & salads.  So they do the same thing but with indian food.  It kinda works for the rice bowls, but the salads are a bit strange.  I tried the Masala chicken on top of a bed of salad which was nice.  The dressings are basically the same sauces they would use on their meat: Butter chicken, masala, mint, and something else I can't remember.  I tried both the butter chicken and the masala on the side.  Both were too thick to really use on a salad, so I wouldn't really recommend.  They are new and they said they are looking into some lighter dressing options.  I can't say I loved the concept, but they did seem quite busy with lunch customers, so I hope they do really well here."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because I love rotii and curries.
This is not the place to go if you're looking for authentic Indian food. This restaurant appeals more to the masses.
With all that said, the service was fast and very friendly. The place was very clean and the food was fresh and tasty. I would go here again."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a full experience of Indian cuisine.
This ain't the place , however if you are just needing a joint with a taste of Indian flare and some dishes of it.
You will enjoy this place.
It doesn't have a lot but you have a choice of meat and rice and partial curry to it.
Samosas, and deserts. 
The prices are fair, the space is not bad, clean and the food is representable.
Need your go to Indian \"fast food\"?
This is one of the joints."}
{"text":"You know what- this is Indian inspired fusion in my opinion. 

Or maybe it was just the item I bought. I got the weekend special which was the chicken masala. It was really good. Ordered it with just salad in order to be a little healthy.

Delicious. Best part- weekend special was $6.99 for a giant serving that turned into 2 portions for me. I am a big guy. So It is worth it if you want some quick Indian inspired meals."}
{"text":"I came in for my first time and got the tikka !
I was greeted by great service and prompt delivery of food!
The food was absolutely excellent and full of flavour!
Will be back !"}
{"text":"Bombay roti is sort of Indian lite, fast food restaurant. 
It is cheap and simple but maybe too simple. 
I had the chicken wrap and enjoyed it because it was fresh but it was bland too so the Indian flavour is missing a bit. 
I will come back to try their other items and hope to get bigger and bolder flavour"}
{"text":"No idea how i ended up here.Really average indian food and nothing special. Environment is dead and quite. Wont give it another try."}
{"text":"Yuck. Not authentic at all..seems like a 5 year old put some red chilli powder mixed with water and paneer."}
{"text":"This place has a interesting concept similar to Chipotle, where you choose salad, rice or wrap and then choose your meat and veggies.

I got the lamb kebab in a roti which was pretty good, i thought the roti was a bit too soft so i would probably go for the naan next time.  The meal was $10.15 for just the wrap which at first I thought was a bit pricey but, I literally ate it for 3 different meals so not bad value if you look at it like that.

They also have a lot of nice sauces like mint chutney and curry sauce that you can add on to your food. 

The owner is the guy at the register I believe, and he is super friendly and jokes and interacts with customers which is nice."}
{"text":"Ordered the Masala chicken curry and the Shahi paneer - neither one tasted or even looked like the pictures. The \"naan\" that came with the order tasted old and was more like a chapati. It was quite disappointing."}
