{"text":"Love this place! The boy and I came here for brunch this past Monday, and were pleasantly surprised. The omelet bar offers made to order omelets and eggs with a variety of filling choices, which we both opted for bacon and cheese and were cooked perfectly. There are a lot of different choices, which is great if your with a group or a picky eater, everything from pizza, Mexican to Asian cuisine and sushi. I only wish we more hungry when we came here."}
{"text":"At one time this was one of.the best buffets in Las Vegas but good things do come to an end.  We recently visited the Cravings buffet on 7/24/17. It was a joke.... $29.99 for dinner which includes alcohol.   The salad bar had greens that looked days old and wilted.  I waited 15 minutes at the  pasta station and the chef never showed up. He was in the back. The Asian food section dishes were nearly empty and lets not even mention latin dishes. Grossssss.  No staff to clean the stations, refill dishes, you have to walk across the restaurant to serve your own drinks and are still tacked with 18% gratuity! For what??? I NEVER once had a waiter come take out plates away?? Save yourself the stomach ache on this place. Visit the Aria if you want a real buffet. I know I will."}
{"text":"Excellent food, used the Tix4Dinner and received limitless beer and wine.  Had a great meal."}
{"text":"It is one of The buffets in Vegas where you can get coupons/discounts for a reason. Food is just average almost bad. But you get free wine and beer!
I dont think i would come back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff whom consistently topped up the drinks.
Tasty dim sum.
Delicious desserts.
Comfortable seating.

One cross - Steak and gravy not great because it was chewy and smelt overwhelming.

Used the bonus food voucher on Smarter Vegas website upon hotel booking.

Visited June 2013."}
{"text":"We asked for a refund within 15 minutes of arriving. which I've never had to do before. The crab legs were so tiny and cold you couldn't get the meat out even though they were cut in half. Each station had very little selection and what they did have wasn't appealing. They couldn't get wood fired pizza right. Prime rib was tough. For the 36.00 per person it wasn't even close to being worth it. Don't bother or waste your money here."}
{"text":"My friend was visiting in town a few months ago and we decided to go over to Cravings to get some buffet action going on.  

I remember the food being alright, if meh, at times.  I DO remember this, it was a bit pricey and they have gelato, and it's not too bad.  They also have AMAZING macaroons!  I ate 4 or 5 of them, and even snuck a couple out with me in my purse.  I had to, they were the best macaroons I've ever had, and I don't really like coconut.  Yeah, I'll eat a macaroon once in a blue moon, but it has to look good, and these, just looked like they'd be good (kind of like a Madeline), I'm soooo glad I went and tried one.  I'll admit I spent most of my enjoyment in the dessert section of the buffet.  I had cakes, and macaroons and gelato....

I remember feeling a bit ill afterwards, like I'd need a long trip to the bathroom, (but that didn't hit me right away), or that I was instantly 8 1/2 months pregnant.....instead, we drove home (luckily not far at all) and my friend was sending me text messages from the bathroom telling me how awesome Cravings treated her....and left her in an awkward sometimes painful experience on the loo.  

All in all, it's not the worst, and not the best, yet I've still not been able to find the \"best\" one yet.  Still looking."}
{"text":"Tried this last night since we were at the mirage already for the Beatles Love. So disappointed with the food. We should have gone to Carnegie Deli instead. Tried the Italian station first and got the pork scallopini and ravioli. Pork was so tough and ravioli is not any better from the store bought kind. Only went downhill from there with the Asian station. The pad Thai didn't taste like pad Thai. The sushi was bland.  Wish mirage would put more effort in creating tasty dishes.  There are better options for dinner at 29 pp."}
{"text":"We came here around 7:30ish and only waited fifteen minutes in line, so not too bad.  The selection was a little disappointing at some of the stops but most of the food was pretty good.  I had some great ribs, mongolian beef, corn bread, mashed potatoes, turkey.  I had an ok gyro, really awful \"garlic chicken\" and amazing pistachio gelato and sugar free peach pie.  

The layout is easy and manageable and the food was overall really great, so four stars it is!"}
{"text":"Meh... this place was alright. Nothing spectacular unless you're into sugar free deserts. Lots of those.

The 'fresh' crab legs were anything but. There sure were a lot of them though. Same with the ethnic dishes (Mexican, Chinese, etc). Same goes for their BBQ.

If you're looking for a good buffet to go to while on the strip, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Our family, party of five, went to Cravings for the dinner buffet. If I could give it zero stars I would. My husband, a veteran of Vegas buffets, said the  buffet was lacking in the quantity of offerings (among other things). He said he assumed this would be the Vegas buffet he's come to expect so he didn't walk it beforehand. He said it was the worst buffet he's had in 40 years of going to Vegas buffets. The rest of the family, Vegas buffet newbies, thought there were plenty of offerings but the quality was sorely lacking. None of us thought the food tasted good and we tried every station. Since we'd been saving our appetite for the buffet, you can imagine our disappointment. You know it's bad when you are cheering the fact frozen yogurt was available for dessert and at least it tasted good. Would definitely not recommend the dinner buffet at Cravings in The Mirage."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Mirage this last trip and gave this place a shot on the last day for lunch.  Reasonable price, the food is surprisingly good.  They have a good selection of Chinese.  Heard roast beef is delish, juicy and tender.  Not much selections for dessert lovers tho.  I would rank this place as my 2nd choice for buffets after Wicked Spoon."}
{"text":"Ok. Less good than anticipated. Expected better quality from The Mirage...especially for the price of dinner buffet.
Some items appeared as if they had been there for quite a while.  Station attendants were not present, had to wait at several stations for assistance. Carving,  etc.
It was not crowded.
Service at tables was very good."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Mirage for 3 nights and the buffet is the most logical way to go. Breakfast is much more reasonable than the pantry breakfast restaurant in the hotel, drinks included and more than one plate. We had breakfast at the buffet every morning. Dinner was good. Lots of options including crab cold and hot and unlimited beer and wine."}
{"text":"The weekend unlimited beer and wine is apparently subsidized by the quality of the food. I'm glad we looked before we bought. I'd rather buy a drink and have better food. I've seen much better buffets on a a Carnival cruise!"}
{"text":"After reading the mixed reviews, we went to Cravings with fairly low expectations.  We were seeing the Beatles LOVE show later that night, so we got a discount on the buffet.  We were pleasantly surprised though by the quality of the food.  We mainly stuck to the things that looked appetizing and didn't bother trying anything else.  

Things I would recommend:
-the all you can drink wine (included for free)
-prime rib (honestly, the best we had out of all the vegas buffets)
-bbq ribs (we preferred them even over the ones at bacchanal)
-salmon handrolls (sushi)
-gelato (chocolate, pistachio, mint chocolate chip, and vanilla)

Overall, the buffet is nothing fancy, but it has a few stellar options!"}
{"text":"Came here twice the first time i fell inlove with it! Not a long wait at all. Food is great had a lot of variety! Service is really good and friendly. They have a bunch of desserts also and gelato! 

The second time i came here i was a little disappointed because there wasnt as much food to pick from like the last time i came here. Desserts looked the same also but no bigs, but i just wish they had the same variety like the first time coming here.

I would come back here to give it a 3rd try !"}
{"text":"I've been to this buffet a couple of times for dinner and i love it! They have a huge selection such as italian, chinese, american, etc. and even a gelato station. It's about $30/pp but it's definately worth it. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The buffet has 11 different stations, but each station had limited dishes. The stations are really spread out which results in food getting cold before reaching the table. Saving grace of the buffet was the free beer & wine."}
{"text":"Good food and included drinks made this good value for money. Also friendly staff made it a good experience overall."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here several times and they have all been good experiences. So on our recent trip to Vegas with my brother and sister in law, we practically dragged them here. It ended up being one of the more disappointing meals of the trip.

My guess is that we went too late. Which is another point to be made?  Why do some buffets close so early? 9 pm seems to early to close, even if it is a weekday. We barely made it time, around 8. The food was cold and our whole group was left feeling less than satisfied. 

It makes me never want to suggest a place to eat again. We will probably give it another go. When it is just me and my husband we usually have dinner a bit earlier and I suspect that was one of the problems."}
{"text":"This is my fav buffet in Vegas! Every time I go to Vegas, I have to stop by here. Even if we don't go out or do anything else, if I just have me some Cravings then I'm completely happy for the rest of the day!

Prices are affordable and the food is great. I luv the craved ham and Chinese station here. Lots of variety to choose from! Try the Chinese bbq pork buns! To me, most buffets taste the same since they're making everything in big batches. So, why would I want to pay more at other buffets for the same type of selections? 

Also, I hate peeling my own shrimp, so I like how cravings does it for you. They always have plenty of cut crab legs and cocktail shrimps! So enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing Buffet! The food was great! The BBQ tri-tip melts in your mouth. The Asian selection was amazing! I loved everything I ate. The only thing I wasn't super stoked about was the prime rib. A little over cooked for my liking. The desserts however were the best!!! For a buffet the desserts were worth it!"}
{"text":"So where do you go in Vegas when you have a total of 9 girls in your party and they are all on a budget? A $25 dollar per person buffet seems a little over the top. I mean, how many girls can eat $25 worth of food right? 

Well, let me tell you about Cravings! It was honestly the best $25 dollars spent in Vegas this weekend! This place was so amazing I couldn't wait to get home so I could write a Yelp review about it. The selling point was the bottomless complementary Mimosas. 

Not only were we drinking endless amounts of Mimosas, we had the best server ever. She never let our champagne glasses reach less than half full. She was on point. While we were being loud and laughing a lot, she continued to have the biggest smile on her face as she contributed to the intoxication of our entire party. 

I'm not sure if it was my excitement of being at a buffet or if it was the mimosas, but I had the best breakfast ever. I had prime rib, mashed potatoes, sushi, shrimp cocktail, scallops, a burrito, a slice of pizza, gelato, wild rice, awesome guacamole (and I'm picky about my guac) and the list goes on. Everything at the buffet was amazing. They had an omelet station, a build your own crepe station, a sandwich and panini station, a create your own pasta dish station, Pho soup, sushi, prime rib, great deep dish pizzas and even more. The list is never ending. 

The atmosphere was nice. The decor was open and modern. The service was excellent and it was definitely worth $25 per person. 

This is going to be my new hot spot to hit up every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"good location, easy parking, affordable ($25 w/military discount, $30 otherwise).  unlimited drinks (beer/wine)! just make sure to tip the completely overwhelmed bartender.

food: multiple stations, serving a sampling from the spectrum of American cuisine. i had nothing disagreeable, and plenty of deliciousness.  dessert selection exceeded my expectations.  great Vegas buffet experience!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night, and had a great time!

The service was great.
The food was hot and tasted amazing (the buffet divides the food into categories such as Chinese, Latin, barbeque, seafood, Italian, etc.) 
The price is reasonable, but a little on the high end in my opinion (29.99 each for dinner) 
The decor inside the buffet was upscale and classy, loved it! 

Overall had a great time, and would recommend checking it out (maybe for lunch though since the price would probably be cheaper)!"}
{"text":"This buffet is delicious. The food is very fresh the times I've been. The sushi lacks, but I think all buffet sushi lacks, so I won't hold this against them. I also like that kids 4 and under eat free."}
{"text":"Not a horrible buffet....but not a great one. There is a lot of variety to choose from...but the food isn't the greatest. The atmosphere is great and the service is wonderful. The dessert bar need MUCH help. Not a lot to  choose from there and most of it was horrible. I go to Vegas every year and usually steer clear of this one."}
{"text":"I got a two for one coupon when I stayed at the Mirage and went to dinner at Cravings.  The selection is outstanding and the room was filled with hungry diners. It seems like anything you want to eat is there and many items are delicious.  However, many items are sub par like the sushi.  I've eaten at many sushi places and the sushi here is a D- on the A-F scale. It doesn't compare to the Bellagio buffet"}
{"text":"If a Killers fan can only go to one buffet in LV, you better choose Cravings at the Mirage. Yes, it's a bit on the pricey side, but this might just be Brandon Flowers' favorite buffet. He said in an interview with Zane Lowe at a music festival- \"We've seen James, and Arcade Fire... it's better than a buffet at the Mirage!\" More info here: http://thesponge-dani.blogspot.com/2011/10/victims-pilgrimage-killers-fans-guide.html"}
{"text":"Do not waste your 28.99 plus plus 18% gratutity!!! Food selection is HORRIBLE!!!! Disgusted...Not worth it!!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill.  The food tasted so bad.... I think I may have better food at Denny's.  Everything was so mediocre.  The dessert station taste like box made. And I can't believe there was not one single fish item in the entire place.  The food was either so picked over or what left on the table was just stale and old.  If you want to throw away your money, then this is the place to do so.  Not cheap.  $75 for two pple.  I'd never go back again.  EVER!!!!"}
{"text":"I went for the champagne brunch and really liked it. There is a large variety of  really good quality food. It is also a good price for those of us who are not made out of money and the servers are fast to refill your champagne glass. 

My favorites were the chilaquiles, sushi station and the Chinese chicken dishes.

I've only been to the MGM grand and Bellagio for brunch but this was definitely better than both of those and around the same price range."}
{"text":"Horrible selection of food. All international foods. Do not waste your time or money at this Buffett. You will leave hungry and disappointed."}
{"text":"We went to Mirage's buffet for dinner last night. It was very disappointing compared to Bellagio we went the night before.  They had a poor variety of foods.  The  broth of the Asian wonton noodle soups was so plain and tasteless. No sashimi, only some sushi rolls.  Dessert selection was so poor.  Fruits were all diced up in small pieces. The price was $24.95 + tax= $26.95.  Will not come back."}
{"text":"This is one of the better buffets if not one of the best  buffets on the strip in my opinion.  We came for dinner and  It was a little pricy but if you are visiting vegas be prepared to pay for quality food. Lots of choices and everyone in my party enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"Out of all the buffets I had over my vacation I have to say I enjoyed Cravings the best, great food selection and everything had flavor. The price not bad and the dessert bar yum yum, gilatto!"}
{"text":"Not even worth one star.  3 people for lunch,  $115. What a waste of money,  food overcooked and chewy.  Spend $6 and go to Burger King,  it'll probably taste beret than this crap. 
We are sitting in the buffet now and this is truly awful"}
{"text":"We have been to this buffet three times now, each time it gets progressively worse. We loved it the very first time a couple years ago and this was on par with the buffet at The Wynn... not so much anymore. First of all the cashier and the seating attendant were not pleasant at all. The food gets worse every time we go there.. even the desserts are worse. They used to have a larger variety of amazing treats (like creme brulee, a variety of cakes, fresh donuts,and even jars of candy for those who are into that)... now it's all very mediocre. 
One of the nice things is that you do have unlimited beer and wine with the buffet... but they need to get a better bartender who actually won't look like it's such a bore to be there. They don't have enough options of the different types of food they offer at each station. And it is now a brunch and dinner option only... which limits the good lunch options because of an extra station of breakfast foods (at 2 in the afternoon most people were not even touching the food at that station, which is a waste of food and space that they could be using for foods that people would actually eat). I would love to come back here but only if I see the reviews improving."}
{"text":"I am sitting here and reading all this reviews wondering why this buffet doesn't have 5 stars. I just left Las Vegas and this was my choice for food my last meal . I think this place is amazing its clean the staff is friendly . People this is a buffet PLEASE stop writing ridiculous demands. My humble opinion is you get your hard earned moneys worth. The food is beautifully made again its buffet is fresh warm the pizzas are tasty the Asian food is great too burger sliders just so delicious. Meats aren't dry. Gelato red velvet cake cookies  cupcakes that are just so cute and great tasting. Great salad bar. For about 20 dollars plus tax you can enjoy all this . People please don't complain about prices you are better off eating here for about 22 dollars (they DO have military discount) than going off some food court. I paid 16 dollars for a slice of pizza and a drink thinking I was saving money . No way ! To wrap this review up ... It's a clean fresh economic and beautiful place to sit down and eat please try ."}
{"text":"The quality of this buffet has gone way downhill for sure.  If you are on a no shellfish, no carb diet, expect to go hungry at this buffet as your dish choices are super limited not that good either.  But on another note, free unlimited beer and wine is included with the buffet for those who can drink."}
{"text":"I  would have given it 5 stars except for the part where they should reduce fee if you are not drinking and clean up of the tables was just a little slow.  I don't mind getting my own drinks because I can get what I want, with as much Ice as I want and not be concerned fingers got in my drink cup when served.

The crab was split and hot, sweet and fresh.  ate till I couldn't eat any more.  just some of the highlights were:   The pork loin with chimichurri sauce was excellent, my husband said the salmon was moist and very flavorful. Many of the other items were good as well.    the deserts were heavenly and I'm a desert expert as far as buffets go.  Bacchanel is our top buffet but this is very good without the long waits.  Highly recommend and will be back.   Locals get a discount so remember that people, but you have to ask."}
{"text":"We had our wedding April 11th in Vegas. We took 13 people with us. We stayed at Caesars palace and asked if we had our reception at their buffet after the wedding if they could work with us on the price since I paid for 6 rooms for 3-4 days. They said no. So I visited Cravings and they were so nice and accommodating. ..and they honored a AAA 20% discount which they brought up. The managers and hostess were so nice. The food was delicious And it included unlimited beer and wine. They saved me over $400 over the buffet at Ceasars. More importantly they  were friendly. .. we will stay at the Mirage next time and visit them again."}
{"text":"Cravings is a good buffet... but  they need to be more consistent in service and selection to be a great one. They excelled in many selections... the ceviches and shrimp were fresh and yummy, the smoky gouda and wine soaked cheddar and italian meats were flavorful and upscale, the asian pork buns, pot stickers, and eggrolls were fresh and spiced well. Their pizza is really good too! 

The entree selection is where it falls short. If you want prime rib, your in luck (but even then its a crap shoot, because sometimes they have a medium and a rare cut and sometimes they just have medium), but it is seasoned well and when rare is available, quite good. The other choices are mediocre and just not worth it... chicken, ribs and nothing with panache. The service can be sketchy as well. I overheard the hostess and they had only 8 servers that night so getting a drink was daunting. Desserts are dependent on the evening... sometimes spectacular (blood orange shooters and panacotta with strawberries) or sometime dull ( bread pudding and cupcakes). Welcoming dining room, large and spacious with the food stations all around the perimeter."}
{"text":"Nothing to eat here. And it's overpriced. I ate pasta to get away from starving. Very small section. Not even 1/3 of Caesars, 1/2 of Wyne, but  it is almost expensive as all other buffet. Do not waste your money!!!"}
{"text":"Too expensive for the poor quality of food.  I had eggs benedict and the muffin was hard as a rock.   The salad bar was ok and the deserts were ok but none of the rest of the food was very good and the over-all taste was extreme saltiness.  Our server was a very nice lady, by the way.  

I am not a food snob.  I love cheap diners and cafeterias. If this place charged, say, seven dollars for the meal I would have been content.  What annoyed me about this place was the hype and the price.  But that's what Las Vegas is all about-  an illusion of quality hiding a core of mediocrity or worse."}
{"text":"Yum!

This place is excellent! Usually with buffets most people, including myself usually go up for one to two servings. When I went here I went up several times. The quality of the food is very good; there is something for everyone! The waiters are very attentive asking if you need anything. The price is pretty good for what your getting. Personally I enjoyed the all you can eat sushi bar. Whenever I'm in Vegas, this is the buffet to go to!"}
{"text":"I went to Cravings buffet hoping for a great experience but end up a little disappointed knowing such a great established casino like the Mirage can do better! 

I was there for a Sunday dinner for around $30 includes tips with the discount voucher from tix4tonight! As always, the staffs r very attentive and nice like most of the buffets on the strips. The plus side of the Cravings buffet is the unlimited beers and champagnes included.
The quality of the booze r quite excellent  and refreshing! I seen people going to the bar more than the food. Not that the food is bad! It is just not very appetizing! The only food section which stands out are the deli meat section, the crab legs, the BBQ and the Mongolian stir fry area which you choose your own meat and veggies. The self-serve soda machine was a plus. It is quite the technical marvel! Each soda machine has at least 200 soda pop flavors to choose from! The kiddies will have a blast with it!

Overall the experience was mediocre! But the cheap deal and the excellent quality of the booze do make up for it if you are a drinker and on a budget. I hope Cravings buffet management better improve its quality. I just hate to see such a great establishment go belly up like so many of the other buffets on the strip!"}
{"text":"My cousin took m here for brunch. It was \"ok\". I've never been a buffet in Vegas... not since I was 10 years old. It's crazy how expensive buffets in Vegas can be. I guess different place have different prices - Craving was only $15 for the brunch. 

Since they stop serving breakfast at 11AM go there a quarter till because by 11AM they whip out the lunch special. I think they have different pricing for lunch... not too sure though.

The lay out of the place was cumbersome. Although they have good intensions I think the location of each section of the food made it difficult to grab the food. 

The service was ok. Nothing to spectacular. They just refilled our drinks and took our dirty plates away."}
{"text":"The food to me was just ok. The staff was friendly and our drinks were brought out in a timely manner. Nothing stood out. I was so disappointed that I saw they had lobster bisque but it tasted weird. They get 4 stars because you can get unlimited beer and wine, staff is nice and prompt and my hubby said it was the best prime rib he's ever had!!!! even better than Belliago or Wynn buffets.  It was so nice to see him rave about how good the prime rib was with wine. He wants to come back for just the prime rib again! The place was also clean unlike Aria's buffet."}
{"text":"Oh man, two choices of bread pudding, once custardy and hot and the other a warm fluffy chocolate.  This gives you the idea.  Food quality and ranges choices are well-beyond the standard buffet fare.  Food is changed out frequently, nothing sits for long. For lunch, these highlights: eggs benedict , pizzas (four choices, including hawaiin with thick-cut ham and a white-parma), and the Asian station, with six choices of sushi, pork-and-chicken wonton with watercress, and rice noodle with eggplant.  Soft drink stations has, what, a hundred choices perhaps (vanilla Mr. Pibb!), but as with any buffet go light on the drinks (even the beer wine) and you'll enjoy more food."}
{"text":"The best thing I like about this buffet is that you can get up and get your own drinks. The worst thing about a lot of the other buffets is that you have to wait for a busy server to refill your coffee while you could have easily gotten up and done it yourself. After all we get up and get our food, why not our drinks."}
{"text":"Excellent food, extensive selections, included beer, wine & mimosas.  Got tickets at Tickets 4 Tonight & it was a great deal at $14"}
{"text":"This buffet was not good. The selection was horrible.  I like to start out with a nice salad but couldn't because there wasn't much to choose from to make my salad.  I decided to go to the sushi bar and grab a few. The sushi had no flavor, dull, bland, and seemed old.  

The food was cold  not a good selection to choose from and their deserts were to laugh at.  I think my local Home Town Buffet has a better selection and much fresher. I can say the only item that was good was their prime rib.  It melts in your mouth.  But that is it.   

I will not return.  You do not get what you pay for at this place.  Give it a try and you'll see that their food is not that fresh.  The quality and their selection is to laugh at."}
{"text":"This buffet was one of the worst buffets I have ever eaten at!!! The sushi was awful.  the only good thing was the bar that's inside of the buffet and you can take a drink with you!!  The very 1st one I've seen!  The soda machine is the one with all the coke flavors!  I hope they get better!"}
{"text":"Such a great deal. I went here with a large group for lunch and bought the tickets at the discounted ticket booth on the strip for only $12.50! Crazy deal for all you can eat and all you can drink (select beer and wine). 

Dessert is always my favorite part. They had bite size desserts, perfect to try one of everything!"}
{"text":"Op straat kwamen we tix4u tegen waar je allerlei kortingen kon krijgen, waaronder op dit buffet. Voor 11-13 dollar ofzo kon je hier van 11-15u (ofzoiets) eten zoveel je wilde. Het eten was goed en erg gevarieerd.
Wel zat je gewoon binnen in een (koele) ruimte tussen tafeltjes met andere etende mensen. Je had geen uitzicht naar buiten of verdere spannende dingen. Ideaal om goed te eten, maar let wel op, voor je het weet zit je hier best een tijd en tijd kan kostbaar zijn in Vegas.
Wifi was aanwezig."}
{"text":"At Cravings, they have a variety of food from  different kinds of seafood to Italian to a variety of meats and a whole Asian section (including won ton soup, sushi and Pho) and indeed this place was satisfying my cravings!  The Crab Legs were so addicting! I first had a whole plate and then went for seconds. The shrimp was good because it was already peeled and ready-to-eat. The Prime Rib was MELT IN YOUR MOUTH GOODNESS! :) The Seafood Cioppino was done right but may be a little spicy for some people. But I thought it was alright! 

For dessert, try the NY Cheesecake with Dark Chocolate Shavins (they have a bunch of in dividual cheesecakes). It was so good! Also the hand-scooped ice cream (try the Hazelnut!) was so delicious. They have a  time that they have for Crepes and once it closes, it closes.

Service we got here was great and I don't think no one else could have done a greater job like our waiter Alberto did! Changed plates, gave us drinks when we wanted a refill. Awesome job."}
{"text":"The service was very good. The food was ok. It was nothing like the buffet at Wynn (the crab legs didn't look fresh at all). But overall a good dining experience."}
{"text":"This review is for the Mirage \"Cravings\" Lunch buffet...

My wife and I went for lunch last week. Man, was I disappointed! I read reviews that the \"live\" stations were good, but what I experienced was pretty sad for a supposed \"upper tier\" buffet.

The wait to start the buffet wasn't too bad, about 8 minutes or so. It was a Wednesday around 1:00 pm.

It's like a giant horse shoe layout with a very odd and VERY limited amount of choices. Very spread out. It started with so so pizza, a few pasta dishes I just wasn't interested in and a carving station that had prime rib and turkey, (which wasn't bad, to be fair). 

Next was the lame taco bar which really seemed out of place and again slim pickin's.  Then there were a few odd fish choices, but nothing that really looked to good. The Chinese dumplings were one of the few highlights. 

The sushi was pathetic. No actual fish to be found. Argh

There was a somewhat okay cold cut and cheese selection though with a few nice salads and the gelato was excellent. The dessert plates were pretty good.

The wait staff was attentive and did take care of the beverage needs well.

But, over all, I wouldn't spend 19.99 plus tax per person on this lunch again.

I guess I should have gone to the Bellagio.

Oh well, live and learn."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast. The french toast and pancakes were good. My dad and I brought a take-a-way box and stuffed it full; nobody said anything, just be discreet. Service was OK. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"So my wife and I and our two friends went to Cravings (the Mirage Buffet) for lunch during the week.  It was $18 and well worth it.  It was surprisingly quiet.  The floor plan of the buffet is great, because the line goes around the eating area and with different stations in different places. 
 
The stations were carving: prime rib and turkey, rotisserie: chicken and potatoes, Latin: ceviche, quesidillas, enchiladas, rice, beans, BBQ: wich I didn't even get to, Sushi, salads, desserts, and a sorbet bar.  But the topper was the all you can eat shrimp and crab legs, we were so surprised and excited.

The variety was appreciated, after going to the Bellagio and seeing many of the same dish styles.  I dunno what the dinner was like, but the lunch menu was exactly what we needed after a night of drinking and a hungry stomach.  We can't wait to return to this buffet!!"}
{"text":"decided to try cravings buffet during my stay at mirage, when I Chek out the menu in front of buffet I was very impressed with options like, strip loin carving station and skirt steak tacos this would be my 1st time at vegas buffet. but when we went In that was not the menu they were serving.
they did have alot of options but mostly seemed dry and sitting out 4 long time.
I found the made to order pasta station and that was pretty good. over all food was mediocre was pretty disappointed I expected more from Vegas buffet."}
{"text":"All you can eat crab legs and shrimp....Do I need to say more?

This place has a variety of dishes. Great good for a good price...Delicious deserts. 

I went during brunch...so I got a taste of lunch and breakfast...so If you want more of a dinner..come here after three....

This place isnt the best like bellagio or Rio...but its pretty darn close.."}
{"text":"Got a coupon to this buffet from the Tix4Tonight booth.  Not in my top 5 picks for a buffet but went with it because of the coupon, which took 30% off the price.

The buffet is divided into stations.
Crab legs seem to be the big seller here but other than that, the fish section was weak.
The sushi looked dry.

Overall the buffet was boring and lame.
Not a great selection and while nothing I had tasted bad, it wasn't great either.

Beer and wine was unlimited, but they were serving only one type of beer.
It was a decent meal on the cheap, but not somewhere I would go again.

If you can afford it, go to Caesar's or Wynn."}
{"text":"Pro side: unlimited beer, wine and drinks. Large selection of food, including Chinese, pasta, salad, and entrées. Excellent variety makes this an affordable choice for families, with lots of food that appeals to both adults and children. Things that are supposed to be fresh are fresh, with abundant toppings/options. 

Con: All food tends to be filling, and the sheer quantity does no substitute for quality. For instance, I have never, ever had such mashed potatoes that they tasted like cardboard soaked in chicken broth....with similar consistency. Or gelato that's was really just syrupy sorbets. 

However, you get what you pay for. At around ~$30/person, you still get crab legs, shrimp and sushi. The  environment is less fancy than Wynn, and the quality is a bit lower, but I feel the unlimited beer and wine make up for that. Not to mention the lower price. 

Things I recommend: crab legs, shrimp, guacamole, salad, and desserts. 

Overall: it was okay. Nothing spectacular. 

PS: to the previous reviewer: they changed the Mlife sign."}
{"text":"It was fine.  Not spectacular.   Not disappointing.  Well, a little disappointing.  Would have appreciated some higher quality foods- especially the smoked salmon.

Felt a bit like a cafeteria vs a hotel."}
{"text":"We stayed at The Mirage, 11/2015.  They have an unlimited beer and wine bar (we didn't utilize it) but, Cravings, was quite good,  We didn't even venture into the northern half of their facility! The food was A++!"}
{"text":"Would like to give '0' stars but have to give at least 1 star.From the time we got in the line with only 6 people (not 6 singles, but multiple people in most of the group in front of us, the horrible experience started with slower than slow cashier. It literally took more than 10 minutes for her to take care of the 6 people  before us. After that, we were excited about the flavorful food that awaited for us. Well we are still waiting 48 hours later. For almost $70 for 2, one would have thought that they had some real interesting food. Another disappointment! The seafood was just ok, the American food was bad, the Italian food was sub-par, the Asian food was ok, the carving station was a joke. No ham, the prime rib was ok but was not a 'steak' cut it was close to wafer thin, i think the guy carving thought he was paying for the prime rib as he practically shaved that piece of meat.  Not a good selection of food for a Thursday night. Found nothing that was spectacular and tasty. Their 'big' idea of adding unlimited beer and wine was a joke. 3 low end wines and the choice of beer was Bud Light on tap and an IPA.  No wonder it was unlimited. The best thing about this buffet was that the person picking up the dishes was nice and pleasant. The hostess was mad and had no personalty (in fact) she should be fired for having a poor attitude, she said nothing when she showed us our table. No orientation to getting our own self service drinks, no pointing out where to get the plates, no nothing, just someone who didn't want to be working and she was definitely in the wrong position.

The bottom line is. If you want to overpay for food that is cold and tasteless, you found the right buffet."}
{"text":"Good buffet at a good price. Best ham I ever had was found here at the carving station.  Brunch was a little light on Latin food, hence the four stars. Good seafood options and love how they make and present salads"}
{"text":"Well well, this is the best buffet restaurant in the U.S. We have done a whole bunch of research before we tried. This one was rated the top buffet in Las Vegas. Everybody who visits Las Vegas should absolutely try it. Service is good, food is good, atmosphere is good, .....price is good too!"}
{"text":"Hit the spot. Went 2 days in a row on the weekend. No long lines. Quality of meat very good. Breakfast choices great . Unlimited beer wine mimosas included! Friendly & helpful staff."}
{"text":"I have been here five times and there is never a line here. I should have learned my lesson by now. The food here is average for a strip buffet. Nothing stands out.

The serving layout has changed since my last visit. The area at the far wall where the seafood selections were located next to the bar has been replaced with more dining tables. This means to get from one side of the serving area to the other, you must now carry your plate through the dining area and thread your way through the tables to reach the other side. That's OK unless you've had a few drinks in the casino before your meal.

Speaking of drinks, our server refused to take our drink orders for wine. So what's the purpose of placing a drink menu on the table? We didn't find out until after the meal wine and beer are included with the price of the buffet. Oops. There goes your tip.

As usual, people keep saying how good the \"King Crab\" legs are. I want to tell those here on Yelp who keep posting \"Yeah, King Crab!\" pics, those are snow crabs. You know who you are. They were sliced in half, dry and had no flavor. I've had better in California casino buffets.

If you are staying in the hotel and are tired of walking, and just want an average meal, try Cravings. But if you want a quality buffet meal, go over to Bellagio or Wynn."}
{"text":"First off--it's pretty expensive for the dinner buffet. It was 29.99 plus tax for my husband and I to eat as well as our teenage daughter.  Our youngest daughter was a bit cheaper. However, the food was delicious. There was a ton of variety and it was absolutely delicious. I think it's a great buffet and it is worth the price IF you are really hungry from walking the strip. Just be prepared to spend 120$ or so for 4 people."}
{"text":"My family of 3 all loved it. Put us in a food coma after. yummmmm the dessert bar was my favorite!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Buffet foods are food made in mass so quality is always pushing mediocre to a little better than that. It is hard to keep quality high but cravings does a good job. They are bigger buffet with a larger variety out there, you are in vegas! For brunch they have an omelet bar, prime rib, snow crabs, lots of asian choices, some dim sum and the usual varieties of sushi and chinese food. They also have  salad and sandwich bar which is great. They have breakfast foods, italian, mexican...there are foods from all parts of the world.

The dessert bar has a prettt good selection. I like their bit size selection so I can take a bite out of a variety and not feel guilty. They also have a gelato bar in the far corner which is nice.

Of all the buffets in vegas, it is a decent buffet, not best, not worst but a solid buffet to try. Price is fitting for what they offer"}
{"text":"Great selections, plenty of stations and really good wait staff. This buffet is what the Spice Market used to be like. Creative dishes from different cultures and one of the best desert and cheese bars around. Well worth a trip."}
{"text":"I booked Vdara which included a $20 per person per day buffet credit (excluding gratuitities and taxes) and the Mirage was one of the participating hotels.  We tried out their lunch buffet.  My husband really enjoyed the seafood including mussels, clams, and small scallops.  He also loved the wide variety of foods, which he thought was better than the Aria buffet dinner we had the previous night.  I tried the Chinese items from the buffet including congee and a BBQ bun and it was okay. I liked their Mexican items the most.  The desserts were just okay - nothing fancy.

The service was just okay, and I found my cutlery to be a bit dirty.  I had to wipe my cutlery down."}
{"text":"I've only been here for lunch because it costs less.

I've been here twice and stuck with the Asian section-I loved the Miso soup, Pepper Beef and rice. And the little pork buns were cool.  Both of my experiences here were pretty good-I prefer to sit at the bar.  However, I was very disappointed with the prime rib the first time I went-thick, flavorless, and too red.  I hate wasting food, but I had to pass that one off to trash.  I've had a couple of desserts there and they were good, so I could care less if they're \"sugar free.\"  Not my all-time favorite (that would be The Forest at Harrah's Lake Tahoe), but good enough for me to return."}
{"text":"We got a couple vouchers from tix for tonight, which really made the trip worth it. Enjoyed the shrimp, soups, and the sausage with peppers. The dessert was a little lackluster, but the service was great. Definitely recommend picking up some coupons for a couple dollars first."}
{"text":"i have been here on 2 different vegas trips and it is still probably my favorite buffet (it and the bellagio so far, still need to try wicked spoon, but that is for the next trip).  they have a large variety of food, my favorites are the ribs, the asian part where the guy makes you whatever soup that you want, and it is really good soup, crab tastes good too.  the sushi is very meh, and i would not recommend it at all.  if you want sushi, go to the bellagio.  the italian section is good too, but my favorite section is the dessert section.  the pastries are very good, and some contain alcohol which i have not seen at any other buffet in vegas.  cookies are nice and soft and chewy, but the thing that makes the buffet really good to me is the gelato bar.  they only have like 5 flavors if i remember correctly (chocolate, vanilla, lemon, pistachio, coffee, and some berry one i think) along with a variety of toppings you can put in it.  i think the gelato bar is what sets it apart from any other buffet.  ill probably be here again in one of my upcoming vegas trips"}
{"text":"If there is a 0 star rating, I'll definitely rate this place 0!!!!! The desserts are too sweet and seems like out there for a long time. The fruits are not fresh and not sweet. Service is soooo slow. We can't find any napkins when we arrive here. And we need to wait for a long time to get a waiter to notice us. There are so many empty tables and waiters but nobody notice us. The sushi tastes like Mexican food when it is not suppose to.... Wasabi looks liquid but it is spicy enough for me. Crab legs are too salty that I need to drink so much water. Orange juice r too sour. Hot n sour soup is too salty,.. The price is too expensive for this kind of service, it costs around 20 bucks!!!!! I didn't eat any shrimps b/c they look bad... Don't go to this place!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't go unless you have a comp. No crab legs at lunch (so do dinner if you can). Everything was sweeter than usual (ex: plantains, shumai, seaweed salad, creme brulee). Jumbo shrimp and dessert were solid.

There are definitely better buffets in Vegas for the price."}
{"text":"The food and services was good. But I ate here last year and the food did not taste as good as it did last time"}
{"text":"This is one of the nicest buffets I've ever been to. For starters, there is ample seating, and the tables aren't too close together, and the service is wonderful. There are many different styles of food to choose from, you'll find something for everyone. There is also an unlimited open bar included with your admission. The food is better than I expected for a buffet, and everything was fresh. Couldn't be happier with my experience."}
{"text":"I seriously can not get enough of this place. Every time we go to Vegas I have to go here. What you get for the price is just awesome.  I don't know how they are not busier. Yea you can go to a lot of other places and pay twice the price and still not get as good of choices as you can here. 

You get bottomless mimosas, plus a wide variety of food. Theres crab, asian, mexican, bbq, pho, and almost anything else your heart desires. This time I brought a friend that is vegan and she was still able to eat like a queen.  The dessert station gets better and better every time we go there. The thing that is a little troublesome is that the plates are always too hot at the dessert station, so all my chocolate melts before I get it to the table. I also think having an Ice Cream station would be super cool too! 

Overall though you have to come here, it's not a super fancy buffet. I am saying for the price though you can't really beat it and I guarantee you will leave feeling full and happy."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate at 3 buffets during our recent trip to Las Vegas.  Cravings at the Mirage was the most expensive (dinner: $64.84 for two) and the least favorable in choices and quality.  We were disappointed.  Service was fine though."}
{"text":"Our default buffet in Las Vegas is the one at the Wynn. While the Mirage's buffet cannot compare to the Wynn in terms of the setting or size, I was extremely impressed with it for the price point and in relation to the wait.

We went for Sunday brunch, which included all-you-can-drink mimosas for $25. There was no line to get in, although there were enough people there that the food stayed fresh. I loved the Asian flair. They had four types of Asian soup at brunch (pho, congee, won ton mein, and some sort of miso noodle soup), each with the appropriate toppings available. They also had cracked crab legs (some of the Vegas buffets only serve crab at dinner), shrimp cocktail, and prime rib.  

We were staying at the Mirage, and I would absolutely go back if we were to stay there again. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went during Saturday brunch (3/29/14), there were 6 of us, we were seated right away, no line. Liked the flavors of almost everything we tried, especially their Chinese food, liked their salad section especially since there's someone making your salad as you tell them, liked that they had both steamed and cold crab legs. From the desserts, the creme brûlée was our favorite.  The staff could have been more pleasant and professional, other than that will definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Back in the day (especially when it was under the helm of Steve Wynn), the buffet at the Mirage was the nicest one in town. And even when it took a back seat to fancier, pricier, and more popular offerings from newer resorts such as Bellagio, Paris, and the Wynn, it still held its own as an excellent above average Vegas buffet. As recently as one or two years ago, Cravings offered a great dining experience. While you didn't get more upscale items like seared ahi or beef wellington, you did get a wide selection of food that was delicious and fresh. I recall prime rib that was juicy and tender, mounds of moist crab legs, and steaming entree selections. Well, not anymore.

Now things have gone noticeable downhill. The prime rib which I remembered so fondly was overcooked. My piece of medium prime rib had hardly any pink left in it and no juices running out of it when I cut into it. I can't imagine what a piece of the well done would have tasted like. The crab legs looked a bit dried out and only enough was put out throughout the evening to cover the ice underneath. A lot of the the other meats offered at various stations were also a bit overcooked. Knowing that buffets typically undercook their food slightly (since the heat from the steam trays and lamps finish the job) it suggests that the cooks were not careful with their technique or that the food was just sitting out for too long. 

Many food items were not being replenished or refreshed as often as they should have. The two bowls of ceviche I wanted to try were half empty, with much of the seafood already picked out of it. It remained this way for the entire duration of my meal. The hand rolls at the sushi station were replenished sporadically. And meager allowances of crab legs on the ice tray left me feeling like I was constantly picking through leftovers.

Service at the tables was adequate, but service at the food stations was detached and unfriendly, with hardly a smile to be found. I also had to make three trips to the gelato station before finding someone to offer me a scoop.

To be fair, none of the food at Cravings was bad enough be inedible or unpalatable. At a lesser buffet in a lesser hotel, it might have been passable. However, at $26.99 for a buffet at the Mirage (Bellagio was only a few dollars extra this weeknight) I expected more in terms of quality, freshness, and service."}
{"text":"I always make a point to go to this buffet while I am in Vegas. There's a great amount of variety and the price for a champagne buffet is pretty good. It doesn't happen every time, but our drink waitress most recently was awesome."}
{"text":"Cravings appears to have a wide variety of food like sushi, Italian, and seafood; however, the food quality is lacking. Most of the foods are bland or dry when they shouldn't be. 

The there were only four or five different types of \"sushi.\" Even the California rolls weren't quite right. The crab meat was more orange than it should have been. 

All the Asian food was very Americanized, like stuff you'd find at panda express. The wonton soup was pretty good, but the wontons were not. 

My family and I liked the assortment of beverages which lined an entire wall. 

As for seafood, there was pretty much just cocktail shrimp and king crab legs. 

Dessert: many of them look dry. The cheesecake was weirdly sour, like it was supposed to be lemon cream cake. The cookies were really hard and not chewy or delicious. The three mixed berries was actually pretty good, but a bit too sweet. 

Besides the quality of food, the wait staff were very friendly and courteous. The whole place was clean."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice meal here before seeing LOVE! We had a 2 for 1 myvegas reward which made  the price very low, and exceeded my expectations.  The unlimited wine included more than your basic merlot or chardonay from a box; i chose cabernet sauvignon ( from a bottle) and was satisfied. I started with the imported charcuterie and cheese with my first glass. All quite nice, good variety and quality. From the asian section i sampled the fried spring roll and a dumpling, very nice, delicately prepared. The family seated next to me took platefuls of the singapore noodles; I'm not one to carboload before the theater so i refrained.  From the carving section i sampled some prime rib and some excellent corned beef brisket. I cannot attest to the italian section. Cold crab legs, cold shrimp, warm crab legs, drawn butter, yum! The chicken wings were great and the ribs were good too. Only disappointment is that i saw a sign for gelato and saved room - unfortunately the sign was incorrect, just some self serve sorbet. 2 plates, 3 glasses wine, happy and full before the performance. Will absolutely come back next time i'm in town."}
{"text":"Breakfast is so good. Huge selection. Amazing omelette bar. $15.95 charge worth it"}
{"text":"Your run of the mill buffet. For the regular price, I'd give it 3 stars. For the discounted price from tix4tonight, maybe a fourth star."}
{"text":"Great buffet !! Everything was pretty good. The salad and meat and cheese bars were amazing, the Italian was great for a buffet, marinara is everything . Carving station was good. Only thing i was a little disappointed in was the seafood area. Not much to choose from. Mushy shrimp cocktail, the crab legs were good and pre split and they had some broiled fish, thats it. Free wine and beer bar was awesome though and the deserts were amazing as was the price. Cant beat it. Id deff go back!"}
{"text":"Came here when I was in Vegas last year because it was, like Stack, in the lobby of my hotel. We decided to do the breakfast buffet because I wanted to do Vegas up right and go to a buffet and I can sometimes be a picky breakfast eater.

The service was appalling. That sounds redundant, it being a buffet and all, but our waitress NEVER came to refill anything. It took forever to get our drinks in the first place. She was horrible. I had to steal a drink from another table.

But the buffet itself blew my mindhole. So many choices. So many delicious things. We were full for the rest of the day after gorging ourselves at this place. Maybe there are better buffets, but this one was the most convenient for us. Not bad prices either, considering the quality of the food and how much of it you can get. Crazy selection. I would go again."}
{"text":"The food isn't fantastic but it isn't terrible either. They could use a greater variety of foods. They offered mimosas at every table as if they are supposed to be great, but the Brut champagne and orange juice just didn't pair well. There isn't a huge selection of alcohol but it's free to anyone in the buffet. Plus the military discount cut our bill in half, which was a welcomed surprise."}
{"text":"BEST buffet I tried in Vegas! I tried many while in Vegas and this one was great. First beer and wine is included so thats a plus, you can also buy unlimited mimosas for $16 they will give you a while bottle of champagne to take back to your table. Note that is per person however the bartender was a doll and said that we could just get the one champagne glass and bottle, then make our own at the table with the free juices. 

Come around the change over of breakfast and lunch and you will get double the choices of food as when they put the breakfast away."}
{"text":"I enjoy dining at Cravings when I do consider a buffet as the staff is friendly and accomodating and the food is rather good! The restaurant is clean, modern and has great energy. 

The best part is the salads which are order as you desire!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food was decent. There were different variety of foods, which was awesome. But after awhile it felt as if I was limited. There were American food, Asian, Italian, Latin, etc. however there wasn't much to choose from those categories. I was just expecting more considering the price. Overall, it was a satisfying buffet.

The workers were also kind. One of the waitress accidentally cleaned up our table while we went for seconds because she thought we left (our mistake, should've left someone saving our spot) but she got us a new table in a snap of a finger so it was fine."}
{"text":"This was a great buffet! The staff was great! The unlimited wine was a plus! Would definitely recommend this buffet to anyone wanting an affordable, great dinner experience."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for the myVEGAS rewards.  I was able to get a two for one breakfast/lunch buffet.  Came out to about $21 for both the gf and I.  I'm pushing 40 and been to Vegas many times.  This was one if the worst buffets I've been to.  I've even done the Circus Circus buffet and that experience was easily more memorable than what we had at the mirage.  I grew up with the Mirage being one if the marquee resorts on the strip.  National lampoons made a great movie centered around the strip with Nick Papagiorgio breaking bad with Jilly from Philly.  Sadly, I would of preferred what Clark and Cousin Eddie ate at the downtown buffet with the blue chicken. On the positive side, the made to order omelette station was great.  It seems as though everything is just spaced out so that it feels as though there are great food options.  It's a bit of a stretch when in the Latin section you have stale chips to make your own nachos.  Taco Bell is more traditional than what these folks are trying to pass off."}
{"text":"It was just ok.  We went around 4 and there were quite a few people there.  The stations really weren't stocked all that well and there was no one manning the build your own pasta area.  The reason it gets the three stars instead of two is because the staff was super friendly and the beer was very cold."}
{"text":"$26.75 will get you :
Refrigerator flavored bread and butter
Stale chips and runny old salsa
Brown over cooked meat (or is it?)
Sushi (wait, what is that again? Rice and cucumbers, oh yeah, sushi)
Shrimp cocktail from costco
Frozen Crab legs
Burnt potato wedges
A sign that says bread pudding, but I wouldn't dare try it to find out if the sign were true. A reminder of why I haven't done a buffet in 20 years and why I will never again. Blech. 
Nice server though."}
{"text":"I'm a buffet hater usually, would rather spend the money on a nice dinner with ambiance, but this one was actually really good. Everything I had was tasty and well made, down to the onion ring which was flavorful and still crunchy.  The sushi was even tasty, normally buffet sushi is crap. The crab legs were sweet, prime rib juicy and even the broccoli had some spice that made me super pleased.  The only thing that didn't beat my expectations was the egg roll which was weak on the filler. The desert section was no joke and all my selections were yummy.  The creme brûlée was actually perfect,  like they just made it. I've had a ton of mediocre and crap buffets but this one surprised me with every bite. Free wine and beer doesn't hurt either."}
{"text":"The food quality at this place was terrible. We paid $25 per person for the lunch buffet on Sunday (with AAA discount). We did not expect much, but $25 was hard to beat if you wanted to get something on the Strip. 

Here is a quick summary of some of the food which we have tried: 
- Raw oysters - bitter taste, completely not edible 
- Chicken wings - dry and tough 
- Egg Benedict - how could you screw up an egg? yes, they did it - completely bland and tasteless 
- Snow crab legs - little meat but with some salty taste 
- Honey glazed ham - no taste of ham at all; bland
- Prime rib - the crust was good, but that was pretty much it; the meat itself was dry and tough with no flavor 
- Various desserts - all of them were bad and tasted horrible; I love desserts in general as long as they are loaded with sweetness; the desserts there were not sweet 
- Orange juice - diluted with at least 50% water 
- Wine - a little bit sweet, couldn't finish a glass 
- Water - good! 

Please do yourself a favor to skip this place. You do not deserve this culinary atrocity!"}
{"text":"Only giving 2 stars because of the all drink beer. Enough said. The food didn't taste that great."}
{"text":"Disappointing!  Not the same mirage buffet remembered from the past. A bunch of food stations taken out for coke beverage machines and ice tea stations. Good quality ok at best. Their labeled 'gelato' station only serves soft serve ice cream. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"This year is 20 years since my first visit to the Mirage, and though the viewpoint of a 20 year old and a 40 year old are different, given I have since traveled the world, the one lens which remains the same is the understanding of kindness and feeling appreciated. The food is still good and though it has long since been eclipsed in variety and quality by others across the Strip, what struck me today was how few of the staff bother to smile at the guests, and none more so than the staff tending the actual buffets. Indeed one whose name I noted was Bernard (an elderly chinese or other asian) was irritated that I had asked for a slice of prime rib as he was busy filling a bowl of horse radish. He made me wait until he was finished and then quickly sliced a dry piece which he flung on to my plate. Another staffer (an african american man, late forties/fifties, didn't catch his name) looking after the breakfasty items (this was their midweek brunch service) ignored a question I had and disappeared off inside. Sure the rest of the reviewers are right here - there was no line and the food was solid. But the key to hospitality is not just about product, but more importantly about making people feel at home. The Mirage has lost that quality from 20 years ago when it was fully staffed by professionals who remembered the golden era of Vegas and had been chosen by leadership because of their interpersonal skills. I question if Mirage leadership, certainly at the buffet restaurant, is being as critical now. Remember, this isn't a cheap meal at $23-24 and the Mirage is still deemed a four star brand. Not sure if Mirage leadership look at reviews like this but the staffer details are included for them - for the rest of the readership, I do suggest that there could be several reasons why some buffets have long lines and the Mirage has no line."}
{"text":"Best thing I have ever experienced. So many great endless options. I loved every minute. And it wasn't too badly priced"}
{"text":"AMAZING overpriced of course. I went for the champagne brunch and they had more different types of delicious food than you could imagine! I mean 3 different types of shrimp cocktail AND any donut/pastry you could imagine? This place rocks- Defiantly worth coming to it and the mirage- one of the best buffets in vegas!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Vegas buffets for breakfast/lunch.  Lots of variety and a good price for a nice strip hotel.  Chinese, Mexican, Italian, eggs, pizza, everything.    Best place if you are staying in the Harrah's, Mirage area."}
{"text":"First time here with the family. Food was ok. $77 for three adults. Different varieties of food but not too many options. Went for a weekday lunch buffet and it came with free beer and wine. That was a plus. Dessert options were limited. Needless to say, I'll keep trying other buffets."}
{"text":"$25!?
For a Buffet dinner?!
Geez times really have changed in town over the years. (Been coming for over 35 yrs.)

I made up for it and scarfed on all King Crab Legs, Shrimps, and Pork Ribs. The Dessert options were quite good!!! As they should be. Wish I scurried away with a couple for this morning.

Service people were on it. Clearing your spot for the next heaping plate to conquer.

Go again? Sure.
If you have a massive hangover after a night of it. Don't stare at the carpeting here. It could induce \"the spins\". And that just wouldn't be good."}
{"text":"Food is above average but the promise of \"all the beer and wine you can drink included\" comes with an important exception. It's 2 drafts and four mediocre wines. When we questioned a manager,Steven, who took15 minutes to show up, he said that the other beers we'd had the day before (goose island IPA, coors and bud light bottles)were just loose ones leftover. They didn't have any to offer. So they hand out leftover beer? Really?  He even said that what the bartender said didn't make sense that the beer was available in the cooler, but they were charging for it. My guess is that the do better by the guests when it isn't as crowded and cut back during peak times. Too bad the can't offer some slightly nicer options for $33 dinner buffets. Disappointing for a casino we like and expect higher standards of."}
{"text":"This buffet was simply, NOT WORTH IT. First off we waiting over an hour. So many guests with rewards kept coming in that none of the regular guests (my family and I) were getting transferred to the line to get seated. Yes there is 2 lines, 1 to actually pay, and then 1 to get seated. It was so frustrating because no one was controlling the intake of the rewards guests so they kept coming in by the herds! So unfair to everyone else. The overall decor and layout of this buffet needs to be severely updated. Nothing had that \"Wow\" effect like Vegas buffets should have. You had your usual Italian, Asian, American, Salad, etc. stations. There was a lot to choose from but the food was so bland or just down right gross. This is one of the cheaper buffets at around 30 bucks after my AAA discount and the quality of the food definitely showcased the mediocrity of the buffet. Steer clear and go splurge on The Wynn buffet or Caesar's Palace to get that true Vegas buffet experience!"}
{"text":"I went for the weekend champagne brunch, although I was staying at Treasure Island, and was impressed with the selection.  The price isn't fantastic for brunch (I think it was $26/pp), but the food quality was much better than several of the other buffets (and some of the other dining establishments) I tried during my stay.  Our waiter was fantastic with refilling beverages and taking empty plates, so no complaints there.  The atmosphere is modern and relaxed and tables aren't as cramped together the TI buffet, where I felt like I was almost sharing a table with the people sitting next to me.

Biscuits and gravy and the dessert station are highly recommended if you eat here.  I will probably return for future LV stays."}
{"text":"Nothing too special about this buffet, but we decided to eat here again because I love buffets and we were at the Mirage to see a show. Our waiter was really nice and attentive, but I don't think that makes up for the semi-disgusting food. Always a sucker for miso soup, I had to have some. I was disappointed by how salty it was. Nothing else was really that great either, except for the macaroons. Those are always pretty consistent and pretty good."}
{"text":"The food is ok but definitely not worth the $32. The first section I went to was Asian and I was scraping the bottom of the pan for the white and fried rice. I went back later and the rice still had NOT been replaced. Their \" Latin\" section is just tamales, rice and beans. 
Can't say much about the service either, because you get your own beverage. It can be a little difficult balancing a plate of food and beverage in the busy environment."}
{"text":"Very good buffet for the price.  Wide selections of food and dessert.  I especially loved the bread pudding and sugar free pistacchio ice cream, yummm.  The crab claws alone is well worth the price you pay for the buffet."}
{"text":"It was okay and not too bad. I have to say I do enjoy the Rio's Carnival buffet instead. Our server was not too helpful. The desserts were pretty decent since there was the gelato area."}
{"text":"This is one of the more expensive buffets on the strip. It's usually about $25 pp for dinner. It really is an average buffet. They have a pretty good selection but the food ranges from just ok to pretty good, certainly not great. The dessert is horrible so if that's a biggie for you then you should skip this place all together. This buffet is fine if you don't mind the price but if you are only doing one or two buffets on your trip, skip this one."}
{"text":"I would have given this place four stars before last night.  We went for an early dinner at around 5:00, and we left extremely disappointed.  It just seemed like everything we ate was of lesser quality than we have grown accustomed to at Cravings.  The sushi selection was minimal.  Roast turkey from the carving station was dry.  Brisket from the BBQ station was fatty and tough.  The only things we liked were the crab legs and some pork dumplings from the Asian station.  We actually wondered whether or not there were new chefs or new management.

Having said that, I'm not willing to write this place off after one poor experience when I've had numerous excellent meals here in the past.  I'm sure I'll eat here again, and would still recommend this place to others, albeit with some reservations."}
{"text":"One of the better buffets we've had the pleasure of enjoying.
My wife and I took advantage of a Travelzoo two for one deal, so dinner was $29 plus tax. The food was way better than other buffets and if you can get two for one pricing, well what can I say... WOW !!!"}
{"text":"If Dollar tree had a buffet this would be it. Not worth the price. Seemed like a lot of prepackaged food warmed up. Free beer and wine  was good, even though I didn't have any."}
{"text":"Just don't. Food was not very good and the price was high. The \"complementary\" beer and wine offset some of the disappointment. Next time I will hit up the burger place."}
{"text":"The prime rib here is excellent- would definitely go back just for that. I liked how the food was organized by \"Latin\", \"Chinese\", \"Raw\", \"Italian\", etc, made it very easy to decide where to go. The sushi however looked terrible, and was confirmed by my friend to not be good at all. I would have loved to see more options in the raw section and also in the \"noodles\" section there weren't any noodles, just rice? All in all, I don't know if I would come screaming back to eat here but it wasn't an unpleasant experience either."}
{"text":"My wife and I have over 20+ years Casino/Hospitality Experience and were having an outstanding stay at the Mirage until we went to the Buffet. We got $50 resort credit at check-in and the Buffet was $64 for two adults. Food and service sucked. After having the salad bar, which was very good, went on the entrée portion of the meal. Asian, American, Carving and Italian stations were not appealing to the eye and food did not look appetizing. 
After leaving the table twice both times came back to glasses and drinks on the table left by either a guest or staff member, not mine! Mentioned this to a staff member and she then went on to the station next to the table and was laughing to another staff member. Asked to speak to the manager. While waiting for the manager noticed the manager and staff member talking and pointing in my direction. When the manager came to speak to the both of us her was going to comp are meal and asked to walk to the front of the Buffet for him to take care of this. We didn't ask for this but just wanted him to know so they would be aware of this situation.
While the manager was helping us we got upset because he started to get an attitude towards the both us. The manager came around the counter got in my wife's face and asked what are room number was and that her was going to call security on us! 
All I can say is WOW..."}
{"text":"EDIT: The sushi gave me food poisoning so I'm knocking off a couple stars. 

Came here twice - once for brunch and once for dinner. We got free passes by playing My Vegas so we got to avoid the kinda pricey fee of thirty some dollars per person. The hostesses and waiters are all very attentive, friendly, and speedy. Never had any wait at any of the buffet stations, either. Unfortunately, the food can be extremely hit or miss. The pizza and carving sections are both highlights for me. However, the Asian foods were mostly disappointing, and the desserts were pretty standard. Unlimited beer and wine, though. If you can get a discounted or free pass, go check this place out. Otherwise, I wouldn't say it's worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"This was a big surprise for $29 dinner.  Had the Wynn the night before and had to make use of the comp buffet tix.  The prime rib was really good.  The desserts were pretty good too.  I liked the pho and wonton noodles minus the wonton.  Loooved the macaroons and the watermelon sorbet.  The server we had was really nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Awesome buffet for good price. We are 7 girls. We bought half price tickets for 2$ and we paid $13 at Mirage buffet. Yes, we got a delicious intercontinental brunch just for 15$. It's really worth for your price. There are different sections for different country food like Chineese, Italin, Latin, Barbeque, Salads, desserts and many more drinks. We really enjoyed each and every food."}
{"text":"Although it's a buffet, I have to give it a 5. The way it was arranged it didn't feel to much like a buffet.  Service was great to begin with.  Food was pretty good,   Prime rib and crab legs and shrimp along with the best caesar salad were well worth the 18.95 lunch price."}
{"text":"I'm very easy to please, and I certainly don't expect anything incredible at any buffet no matter how swanky it looks, but I went here for dinner on a Tuesday and was sadly disappointed with the food quality. The variety was great, but the only thing I truly liked was the prime rib and the turkey. I've had better prime rib in a few places in Vegas. So much of the foods were soggy, or just tasted bad. Ribs and chicken were dry. I loved being able to re-fill my own drinks (all buffet servers are bad at refills in my experience), and the desserts were REALLY awful. Their froyo was good, though. I definitely want to try their breakfast buffet, but I won't be back for dinner."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favourite buffets and now I will never step in there again, EVER.

I went on Christmas Day and it was bad.  

I only ate the prime rib which was still very good, but I suppose its comparable to the Paris buffet I had the next day, so at least I was full.

The crab legs were FROZEN!!!  Solid, inedible.  many thumbs down.  

Desserts were lackluster, having once served good quality desserts, they were reduced to cheap cakes and disfigured flans.  I mean not a single flan had looked decent.  

Service was lacking as well, nice waitress, though she bitched a lot and looked very overworked.  Lacking because they were obviously understaffed.

I had a good mind to pull the executive chef as he walked past my table and question him regarding what happened to this wonderful buffet.  

Decided it wasn't worth the effort.  Go on to Paris for the same price but much better food."}
{"text":"My favourite Vegas buffet! I have eaten in many and have tried a  lot but this is my fav!!"}
{"text":"Visited twice during our stay in LV. Pros: very decent food, good selection, clean and ordered, wl labeled, free wine and beer, self service drinks (we happen to prefer it that way). Cons: waiting to be seated is painful (we had to wait 40 min the first time). Overall very good experience and value for money. It's not very fancy, i did not like all their dishes, but there was more than enough to make a dinner and I really enjoyed it here. Will come again."}
{"text":"Food Part: Great selection.
Decor:   Simple dining table and chair only. Nothing fancy at all.
Service: Great.

I do like their food selection but the place was  so big compared to Cesar's Palace and that makes me lazy to go and check out what's on the other side. Overall, it was a good try."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a buffet person but I figured we had to try a Vegas buffet. We got our tickets at one of those discount booths which was a great deal. We saved $10 each person and received a VIP pass for the line. The food was really good and everything tasted fresh. I noticed that they switch out entrees that have been sitting out for awhile, so that's good to know. The best part was the unlimited alcohol that's included. That alone is worth the price of the buffet. The only reason. I'm not giving it 5 stars is because they didn't offer a hot shrimp entree, they only had shrimp cocktail. Other than that, I thought the Cravings buffet was delish and would recommend it."}
{"text":"The shrimps were not that fresh and the crab legs were disappointed. The little pizza worth a try."}
{"text":"Ew. Save your money.  My husband and I paid $71 for cold, over cooked food.  Wasn't worth it.  Disappointed"}
{"text":"I KNOW OF NO OTHER BUFFET IN LAS VEGAS, OR ANYWHERE ELSE FOR THAT MATTER, THAT RAISED THE PRICE... AND... LOWERED THE SERVICE!!  After raising their breakfast price by two or three bucks, they now have SELF SERVICE FOR COFFEE, JUICE AND OTHER BEVERAGES.  When those stations are crowded, waiting and spilling is not a fun event at a buffet.  We were told that it was a cost cutting measure so they could fire the bus boys (and girls).  Apparently, this is correct because there were none around, the wait staff bussed the tables. 
It also seemed that the breakfast choices were reduced.  This buffet was an up and down love affair for us over twenty-five years.  Now it's down for good.  I WON'T GO BACK!"}
{"text":"One of the worst buffet we have been to. Maybe it's because we went in at a later time for lunch, regardless of the time they should have more of a variety of foods. With the few foods choices available  VERY few were edible entrées. My kids are not fussy with their food, but for my kids to comment \" Souplantation is a fraction of the cost of here and they have more salads choices than here.\" 

You can't really go wrong with salads, but this buffet doesn't even have the basic starter choices. Total waste of money and Very disappointed."}
{"text":"It's hard to get carried away when you are at a buffet.. As much as I was trying to not go overboard.. I did end up having a Siesta afterwards! The atmosphere is pretty much what you expect for a buffet, informal and open and the staff are not as friendly, more robotic when you ask for assistance but they do their part. Don't expect Michelin star restaurant because buffets are never going meet up to that standard! But the food was surprisingly better then buffets I've had in the pass. There was a very good variety and quality for the price you pay.. $27 something per person for lunch/ brunch. Huge prawns and crab legs all peeled and ready to eat, juicy tender roast beef just the way you like it, a wide dessert range to give you a big toothache, just to name a few.. The food really do hit the spot, get your cravings sorted! ;) oh, drinks are included in the price including all the beer and wine you want!! nb: toilets are outside the restaurants, literally next door."}
{"text":"Great food, selection, price. The unlimited beer/wine is great too. 

Dont hesitate."}
{"text":"It's a nice decent buffet with art deco style. It's very open and airy. The nice thing about this buffet is that they have a basic Dim Sum section, it helps when you crave Dim Sum for dinner....hmmmm maybe that's why this place is called \"Cravings\".....ah!!!! The Chinese/Japanese selection is only mediocre. The have pretty good crab legs and shrimp cocktails there. I like how all the service station are pretty spread out ...so you don't crowd one another. If you come New Years eve they give out whistle/blowers and funky head wears to celebrate the New Year."}
{"text":"16 years ago this buffet was awesome. Went last might and I tried a little bit of everything, trying to find something I liked. The desserts looked nice but were unimpressive. The king crab legs were the only thing that was excellent. If that is what you like then 
It is worth the 30 dollars, personally i like variety when i go to a buffet. I liked my cappuccino."}
{"text":"My favorite buffet with the unlimited brew beer and wine plus food is alright. The touch screen soda machine awesome buffet"}
{"text":"We went to the dinner buffet on a weeknight around 5 pm in early April. We decided to eat here before the Beatles Love show at the Mirage. There was no line to get in. When we left around 6:30 pm, there was a short line.

It's been about 8 years since we last dined here. We were quite disappointed. The decor consisted of unattractive metal and plastic chairs and tables. The food was average, but nothing that we ate was memorable. For $27, there are many other dinner buffets that are of a higher quality. Of the numerous buffets we tried out during our 5-day visit, this was the second worst. Our top favorites were the Wynn and Wicked Spoon."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast buffet and it was exactly what you'd expect. Mediocre to slightly-above-mediocre breakfast and brunch foods. As long as your expectations aren't sky-high, you'll enjoy it. Reasonably priced. The all-you-can-drink feature at  8:30am was a little aggressive but useful if you want to get things fired up right away. Recommended."}
{"text":"I would have rated this buffet as a 3.5 star if I could but since they got some self-serve drink machines I thought that was awesome.  The price isn't expensive compared to some other buffets.  Dinner menu was $30 a person which I was not complaining.  We only gave this one a shot because Ceasar's Palace buffet was packed and we were headed to LOVE Cirque at the Mirage so it was perfect.  

I've read that some people didn't like having a machine to serve your own drinks.  I found it had tons more selections than any other buffet and if you have a bad server, you won't be getting drink refills without waving them down.  Stop being lazy, it is a buffet and I think self serve drinks just make perfect sense too.  I've experienced at the Wicked Spoon that my server took forever to clear plates and refill drinks.

A little thing I noticed was that certain sections they don't refill or replenish the food very well.  For example the Asian food section had a lot of empty items and did not get filled up even by the time we finished eating.  Maybe they just thought no one would get any which does make sense.  Apparently a guest was disgusted that we grabbed the seaweed salad from the sushi area and asked what that was.  When she was told it was seaweed, she had a disgusted look in her face.  Right after she grabbed some sushi which has seaweed wrapped around the rice... Some people are just stupid. Sorry to be so blunt.

i will definitely give them another try just for their drink machine."}
{"text":"I came here in a Tuesday night, the price is good. it is ?29.99 for each person. Compare to other buffet, the price is very reasonable. The beverage is included. However, maybe because it is a weekday, the kind of food is limited. There is only 4 kind of fruits, and 3 or 4 chinese entree. Overall, the quality of food and the service all really good?"}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Not that impressive considering the price is jacked up for Friday and Saturday .  18 percent gratuity for a party of 8 or more mandatory. Why? If we had 2 tables then we could tip what we wanted. Seriously a $50.39 gratuity for a buffet to clean table of plates ? In fact table had empty plates for awhile. I would expect my dirty plate to be gone by the time I returned. I would not recommend this buffet as the price is too high for the low quality."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent about this place! Staff was very friendly and the managers (Jose) made sure everyone was satisfied with their food and drinks. It's not too often where you see mangers out engaging with guest at other places but that's the kind of service you get here. If you want a specific type of dish you don't see out, they will gladly make it for you. Very comfortable atmosphere as well. This was my first time eating here but definitely not my last! :)"}
{"text":"If I could choose one buffet to gorge and die in, it would be this one.
Worth every penny. Next time I'm in Vegas.. I'm commin' here first."}
{"text":"I don't understand the bad reviews for this buffet. I've eaten here twice and it is the best buffet I've ever had. The selection is grand and the quality seems to be top tier. My favorite is the melt in your mouth prime rib, fall off the bones BBQ ribs, perfectly cracked crab legs and juicy shrimp. The tiramisu is slap your mamma good and their overall dessert selection is fantastic. If you're in the area, go here. Make sure you're super hungry so the $25 won't be a waste."}
{"text":"Im a foodie alll day! And I love a great buffet!  Ive been to a few sense my 30 day business stay in vegas and this is by far the best food good selection and worth the price. Brick oven pizza!  Already open crab legs...so you dont starve trying to get to them lol. And hello to the unlimited wine and beer (self serve) hmm what else well wiat tell you see what I had for dessert in the pics...and the biggest selection ive seen at a buffet!"}
{"text":"notes: 1 visit, breakfast/lunch
overall: Excellent high-end buffet, but the dessert section needs a little work.

highlights: 
- Dip the foccacia pizza in some chimichurri sauce, and it's the best pizza you'll have ever had.
- Prime rib is excellent
- I hate crab legs in general, but everyone else says they were great here, really fresh.
- Cookies!  You must try their cookies.  I got so lucky and grabbed some white chocolate macadamia cookies when they were still warm.  Crispy on the sides and chewy and mouth-wateringly good.  I mean, I was stuffed beyond belief, but I couldn't stop eating it!
- If you get in during breakfast time, do try the Portuguese sausage.  It's the only breakfast food really worth it.

Avoid:
- Gelato bar looks good, but the texture was more like the soft serve at Dairy Queen. (which I HATE) So disappointed.
- Shrimp pad thai was served ice cold.  So gross."}
{"text":"I think Mirage buffet has the best selections for reasonable price. The quality of the foods is excellent. The desserts selection is great. One thing I really liked about Mirage buffet better than other buffets at Bellagio and Mandalay bay is because for Prime rib, mirage has two choices, medium rare and medium, also the snow crab has cold and warm options, no other buffets have this choice, furthermore, I found out that the buffet include unlimited wine and beers. Also, the price is a little less expensive than Bellagio and Mandalay bay. I paid $29.95 for dinner buffet which is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Very reasonable price we got via Tix 4 Tonight which was 50%off from regular price.   An awesome deal for New Years week.   We paid $12 pp for brunch mix on Monday.   I loved the Latin food selection and my fiance really enjoyed the meat selection,  including very tender BBQ pork ribs.   We stayed long enough for early dinner which starts at 3pm.  They brought out the amazing snow crabs and roast beef.   The soups are limited but are pretty good. Can't ask for a better deal with this quality of food.  The only down side is the limited selection of food for each ethnic section.   Of course, this deal included unlimited self serve drinks with unlimited selected 2 choices of beer and 5 wine selections."}
{"text":"This place gets five stars just for having their crab legs already cracked!! For those of us that eat seafood regularly you know that's a huge plus. They even had cold or hot crab legs which I like because not all buffets have hot crab legs. I lucked out on a Monday and was able to have a champagne brunch because it was memorial day weekend, yay! They also had a cheese and cold cuts section you don't see quit often that I liked. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Don't assume that if a buffet charges more, you get more.  Cravings was highly rated on Zagats so we decided to give it a try.  We waited in line for over an hour.  We were then seated next to the glass wall where hungry people who had been waiting for over an hour pressed their noses to the glass, watching us eat our meal.  They didn't have enough staff and the place was a mess with dishes stacked on unoccupied tables.
The snow crab legs were puny and hard to eat, and the steamed clams were all closed, meaning that they were low quality or dead when they were steamed.  The turkey was dry.  
A few of the servers behind the counters had attitudes, and our server complained about how tired she was throughout our meal.  My wine glass (alcohol was an extra charge) was dirty and that wasn't remedied until after I was done eating.  The dim sum bar was good and the sushi rolls were passable.  The gelato was good.
This was not a 40 dollar per person experience.  This was a 9.95  per person experienced at best.  
Take your money to Fremont Street and have a fabulous gourmet meal in a nice setting at Second Street Grill."}
{"text":"ate there last night.  selection was poor and the unlimited wine was putrid.   would not return."}
{"text":"Not worth the price at all! You don't charge $35 for a buffet without sashimi! Chicken taste like rock! King crab legs taste like over night socks! You know why they charge you at outside before you come in? You will run away after looking at their food!"}
{"text":"My partner and I received a 2 for 1 deal on the buffet.  I was pretty sure I was going to love this buffet, and it was OK at 1/2 price, but I I would not pay full price.  I did not care for the wine at all, and the only complimentary beer offered was bud light. Personally,  I don't consider the free beer and wine a perk.  You pick up your drink from the bartender, so that is a separate tip from you server...not so free since the glass of wine isn't even worth a buck.  There was nothing here at the buffet that wowed me.  My partner liked the prime rib, but as usual he says it tastes like roast beef and not prime rib.  They are too heavy with the peppercorn as a seasoning on the outside.   The chinese broccoli and asparagus looked really fresh and delicious, but looks were deceiving.  They looked fresh, but both lacked flavor, were too oily and tough.   They have someone tossing your salad for you, which is a nice idea to have one person handling all the salad items, but the reality is a long line at the salad bar.....ugh.   Why not hire someone to make fresh sushi rolls instead?   The fresh fruit was nice, but in typical Vegas buffet fashion, the desserts are more for show than for taste.  Even the sorbet was way too sweet and tasted artificially flavored.   Too bad, I like the mirage poker room and would like to visit again and have a nice, reasonably priced buffet on site  next time I visit."}
{"text":"The food was fair at best the bartender was a punk would not go back the only place mirage should be embarrassed to have this place on there premises"}
{"text":"As far as Vegas buffets goes, this one isn't too shabby. Actually, pretty good selection. They had a fantastic homemade guacamole (I could taste the onions), there was a station with a guy making DIM SUM, brunch stations were AMAZING with breakfast burritos, waffles, yogurt, a multitude of fresh fruit, etc.  

The dessert section did disappoint a little, which is the reason for 4 stars:  Sugar free cheesecake?  This is Vegas, I watch my figure back home so I can gorge on full-flavored food here. 

But, other than, pretty good deal, especially if you're staying at the Mirage"}
{"text":"Just ate at this place and found insects in our food. The GM barely cared and told us it's not a big deal, it's just a bug. Do your self a favor and don't eat here."}
{"text":"This is by farrrrrrr the besssssst buffet I've EVER been too! I was so skeptical about going to a buffet at all because they typically compromise the quality of the food to serve in mass quantities but Not here! EVERYTHING was delicious! I could not even try it all. The price was unbeatable (under 30 bucks) for the meal quality especially considering the unlimited wine mimosas and beer on tap with your meal! I went back two days in a row and we did not plan to do any repeats on our vaycay. But let's just say...I may be back for a third round!"}
{"text":"For my first trip to a Vegas buffet I expected more. The food was tasty, and seemed to be of high quality, but there wasn't the variety that I heard so much about. For $35 a pop I expected more."}
{"text":"My favorite part about this buffet is that they had different variety of food. For example, Asian, Latin, American and all of them tasted amazing. Unlimited mimosas and beer. I def recommend it for brunch. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Came here for CHRISTMAS DINNER!
Mainly because the wait at Wynn was approximately 3.5 hours. THREE AND A HALF HOURS, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

The wait to get in here at Cravings was only about 15 minutes and totally worth it! Just try and get there before the dinner rush starts. We were in line by 6pm.

This place had a TON of food. Great variety. Prime Rib was delicious, nicely cooked, seasoned & the au jus was perfect. Questioned whether the mashed potatoes were authentic or of the instant variety, but it was so tasty, I stopped wondering & just enjoyed myself.
The personal salad bar was great. Got just the right amount with everything I wanted and nothing I didn't. The guy tossed it for you and everything. Very nice.
The sushi was sub-par but I guess that's to be expected. I tried every roll but just by the look of it, you could tell it was whatevers.
The Chinese food they had was really good too, just the basics. & Tasty sweet & sour soup!
They even had Pho! My parents had it and said it was lacking one thing - MSG. Of course.
The seafood was really good! King crab legs, sweet succulent shrimp & the best breaded shrimp ever! Sweet & well-seasoned perfection.

They had Mexican food as well as Mediterranean food. I saw hummus, pasta, bbq, etc etc. Really something for EVERYONE. Great variety! 

The dessert bar wasn't anything too special. Meringues, cake, fruit tarts, macaroons that we all swooned over. But the best part? GELATO! A nice man behind the ice cream bar who would scoop you whatever you please. Coconut, coffee, strawberry, vanilla... only thing missing was green tea. That would have cleansed the palette nicely. Oh well!

Overall, a great value. Our Christmas dinner buffet was $34.95/adult. I think it was totally worth it considering the variety, the freshness & flavor and the fact that we didn't have to wait over 3 hours, like at Wynn. I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went to Cravings for the weekend Brunch and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. They have a very good variety of international cuisines, even for a brunch menu. This was probably the best buffet I have tried yet in Las Vegas. I will definitely return to try the dinner buffet in the future."}
{"text":"It was tasty and fresh everything was full of flavor . They have a whole variety of food and plenty of options to choose from. Did I mention they have an open bar till 3.  Our server was lovely really knew how to keep the mimosas coming. Totally worth your $45 bucks ."}
{"text":"Cravings is located inside the Mirage. It's a nice buffet. Food variety is huge. Almost too much food to select from. Food was very good (except for the mexican, but I am OK with that). Service was excellent which more than made up for the lack of good mexican food. They have really good italian and chinese. Would I go back,? Yes and I have and plan on it in the future."}
{"text":"I wanted a quick breakfast and the mirages sit down cafe had a line so I tried Cravings since it is all buffet. At $37 to sit down for breakfast I didn't get my money's worth, but if you come here hungry and ready to get drunk on on cheap wine, it's an incredible bargain.

Everything I tried was decent - including the omelette that I had made to order.

Incredibly the waitress offered to give me a go cup so I could take a mimosa with me at 10 in the morning. Only in Vegas, only in Vegas"}
{"text":"Good Breakfast buffet. No wait seating on this weekday at 9AM. Great breakfast selections (lunch stuff opens around 11am). Ok service. Good price at $18 ... Especially compares to yesterday at Wicked Spoon for $28. I recommend Cravings at Mirage."}
{"text":"We bought a $4 voucher on The Strip for a buffet lunch at Cravings, which meant that we paid only $11.99 for lunch when we got there. It was well worth it! The international buffet satisfied both my partner and myself, we have v different tastes. I loved the Asian and seafood section, the seafood salad and chowder were amazing, and I loved the Japanese sesame seaweed salad. Pete was kept happy with the free IPA and wine. I'm not usually a dessert person, but the small very tasty portions made sampling a delight! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"How can people say this is a good buffet? It's overpriced and the food isn't that good...at all. I came here for dinner which was $29 per person and for breakfast over labor day weekend (about $39 per person because of the holiday) and was disappointed both times.

They have a variety of different foods which is really the only plus. The food itself isn't good. Everything I tried was either bad or just decent at best."}
{"text":"I've been to Cravings Buffet a few times in the past for breakfast and never had a complaint.  This time my stay @ Mirage included a buffet,  so we tried the dinner buffet,  which I'm very sorry I did.  Worst dinner buffet I've experienced as far a food is concerned.  The roast beef was dry,  the corn beef was edible, which is the best I can say.  The other food, thumbs down.  I thought the fresh cooked pasta would be better, but it was not.  The creme brulee was more watery than it should've been.   Chocolate cake so-so.  Salad was ok, but there's no way to mess that up........ The only redeeming part of the meal was unlimited beer or wine.... Mirage really needs to improve on their buffet considering the last three I;ve visited at the MGM Grand, Bellagio & Aria were nice."}
{"text":"My friends and I were absolutely ravishingly starving when we arrived to Vegas after what seemed to be a flight from hell! Immediately after checking into our rooms, we sought out the hotels buffet to stuff our faces.

I have only read good things about the Bellagio and Wynn buffets and so we walked in not knowing what to expect. 

Overall, it was 'ok' for the price. Fortunately, there was no wait when we strolled in but it was a bit early (5pm). There's  station with Italian, Chinese, BBQ, and seafood. Their seafood option wasn't that great though. All they had was shrimp cocktail and crab legs but the crab legs are skinny and sorta sad looking.

The desserts were 'blah' and nothing mouth watering which was also no surprise to me. 

Overall, we were starving and coming here served its purpose for us but it's definitely not worth a revist."}
{"text":"We just happened to stumble across this buffet after buying tickets to see LOVE.   It was lunch time so it was pretty reasonably priced.  This is  a very big buffet with lots of choices.  Although I felt compared to some of the other buffets in town the quality was lacking a little bit.  Also the service was sub par as well.  Twice when we got up from the table to get new plates they cleaned the whole table off drinks and all, very strange.  But the waitress whom was working very hard to keep everyone happy was quick to get us new drinks and silverware.    I wouldn't go out of my way to come here...I guess if your staying at the Mirage and want to eat buffet food it's worth a try.  Not the best I've had not the worst."}
{"text":"I've lived in Vegas since July and this is the best buffet I've been to so far...have been to 7 of them. I redeemed a buy one get one free dinner buffet off of the MyVegas app. It's normally $38/person but includes beer and wine. The shrimp was awesome and already peeled which is a big deal in my book. Lots of choices overall and loved everything I had."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try Cravings because I'm fond of the Wynn Buffet.  But after my boyfriend's persistent whining I gave in.  I have to say the food was decent, but my favorite part was the dessert section!  I grabbed an entree plate for all my desserts.  

Oh! the crab was okay.  Go to Studio B if you really want good crab!"}
{"text":"If you want crab legs and shrimp and you do not want to shell out $40+ of your had earned cash then this place will satisfy you. I would say 3.75 stars. The quality is between excellent and above average. The service is pretty good. The food selection is not bad. They have the typical fare of different themed foods such as Italian, Mexican,  Chinese, American and Japanese. Like I said, the shrimp and crab legs is a must have. I had Osso Bucco her once and it was delicious. The dessert is not that great but the gelatto was very good.  Now I am craving crab legs...see what you did!!!"}
{"text":"EVERYTHING WAS HORRIBLE!!!! The food looks so bad I thought the person before me threw up on it. \"the great sushi bar\" was offering selection of 4!!!! different rolls. The meat smelled like it was microwaved for the past 10 days. DO NOT EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER GO THERE. that place make McDonald's look like a 5 star restaurant. It's NOT A VEGAS EXPERIENCE.

And CRAZY expensive."}
{"text":"Three stars because the place felt like a cafeteria. Luckily we were seated towards the entrance and away from the hoards of crowded tables. 
The crab legs were the highlight for me. Warm drawn butter and a slice of prime rib made it worth the dollar.
There was plenty of shrimp and salmon and other meats at the carving station. Fresh rolls. Gray beverage selection.We also enjoyed a few sushi rolls and dessert. The salad bar looked great and they had a variety of Asian and Hispanic dishes which to me looked uninviting. The American food looked gross (man n cheese and corn and such ) and I avoided it. The desserts were pretty but a bit flavorless and not s tremendous selection."}
{"text":"We went  for Brunch and I thought the food tasted good. Our attendee Lulu was so very nice. I thought 35 dollars for  buffet with all you can drink mimosas was a great deal. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Had the dinner buffet this evening at The Mirage since the wait for Bacchanal was way too long.  Bad idea. The ambiance was rather cafeteria like & the food wasn't very fresh.  Not worth $40.  The Alaskan king crab legs were very tiny and didn't taste very good. The shrimp cocktail shots smelled & tasted too fishy.  Not very fresh at all.  The fried calamari & fried butterflied shrimp were pretty good, but everything fried always seems to taste good.  The seasoned potato wedges were also pretty tasty.  The $40 did include beer & wine but the food quality was just not worth the money. I'd rather spend a little more money and get fresh, better tasting quality food.  It's not always about quantity as it is about the quality."}
{"text":"Really would like it if they had not cold crabs legs but nice hot juicy crab legs., would have like a much more of a difference in the type of food they had. something much special then the regular buffet for the price. should be more for the price"}
{"text":"This buffet is one of my favorites, Great buffet for a good price.
Lots of selections - Seafood (Crab legs, shrimps, oyster etc), asian food, Mexican, American, European / Italian etc...They have a create your own pasta area, a create your own Panini, Carving station w/ Prime rib, Turkey, Ham, sausage...A little Mediterranean  choices and good desserts...Food is good quality and Nice place to eat..."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our lunch this time around at Cravings.  We've tried The Village at Paris, Spice Market buffet at Planet Hollywood, The Buffet at Treasure Island, and Flavor at Harrah's.  We weren't too impressed at our last visit to Cravings.  It was much better this time.  The restaurant walls are all glass so you can see out and people can see in.  We got a nice table for four in the middle of everything and a nice waitress who brought drinks and cleared the table when she came by.  The first section has someone who is usually making egg dishes.  In our case, omelets.  They will sautee the onions, bacon, and mushrooms and then add it to the omelete.  They have one main guy and he has helpers.  They have a tip jar too.  
Next section along the wall was some cooked items, eggs benedict, either waffles or pancakes.  Whatever was there, a customer in front of me wanted what wasn't there. 
Then there is the meat person.  He had turkey  and prime rib.  The prime rib was well done.  There was au jus and turkey gravy in that section too.  Next was the roast chicken section, fondue and bread/crackers. The fondue didn't harden by the time I got to the table and it tasted okay. 
The next wall had mexican food, but it wasn't well organized or I was going the wrong way.  I walked by cheese, then the meat, chips, taco, and tortillas, salsa, and enchiladas.  Before I forget, the enchiladas were good.  
There was some ceviche and tiny shrimps in little glasses, shrimp on ice in the cubby holes in the walls.  I don't have a good way to describe it.  I tried the clam chowder and it needed pepper.  The texture was clam chowder and it looked good, but it wasn't really tasty.  There was a Japanese counter.  I thought the crunchy spicy tuna roll and unagi roll was too cold.  
The Chinese counter had shrimp flavored chips, yummy, but greasy. It was either a gyoza or potsticker and it was on it's own little plate with a little sauce.  It's the presentation. 
Everything was clean.  Hot and sour soup was the right texture but not enough flavor.  Chinese noodles and rice, sauteed veg and sweet and sour chicken or pork.  I didn't try it. 
The last section was dessert.  They had mini cupcakes.  I liked the chocolate and regular creme brulee cups.  There were also tiramisu in a little cup and I think it was a berry flavor panna cotta.  And the very end had a gelato section.  The tiramisu gelato was good.
There is a lot of food dishes that I'm not mentioning.  The Village was our favorite at one time, same with the others, but we go back and then we are disappointed.  The eggs benedict wasn't very good, the hollandaise sauce didn't stand out.  The presentation is usually much better at Cravings.  There's so much food that we kind of try everything and then we are full.
  
Summary - Cravings was better than our last trip.  Kids were happy, waitress was nice, no dishes were really bad, everything was clean and presentation was nice.  We'll be back and we'll also go back to the other buffets too."}
{"text":"Nice clean environment. Free beer and wine was really cool and I like the fact that you can get your own beverage instead of waiting for a waiter to bring it. Food was not bad. I've had better at other buffets."}
{"text":"First and LAST time I eat here. It's great they have unlimited beer but when I go to a buffet I go for the food. I went during lunch based on other reviews but left dissatisfied with my meal.  It's on the pricey side so I say your better off spending your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"dinner sucked .... The brisket was horribly tough ... Mac and cheese so flavorless .... Only good thing was the unlimited alcohol included ....thank goodness for the 2 for one coupon bc this place sucked ... Pay a bit more and go to the ceasars!"}
{"text":"The food was of poor quality and slow to be replaced when emptied.  The service was not what one would expect from a $30+ buffet. The carving station was often left unattended for long periods of time. The desserts were few and far between.  The best part of this buffet is the short line, but once you taste the offerings you will soon see the reason."}
{"text":"I was not very pleased with their brunch selection but being that we were staying at the Mirage, the convenience of eating here was great.  I actually prefer eating here for breakfast rather than going to the Pantry.  At least at Cravings, there is a wide variety to choose from for almost the same price.

20% discount for AAA members (need to show your AAA card).

Food was okay, but there are definitely better buffets on the strip."}
{"text":"went here with a family of 12, and we had to wait about 40 minutes even though we called in early. the service and staff were kind of bitter and not very accommodating. 
they ran out of prime rib and tried compensating for it with corned beef which was awful.
the sushi was grocery store grade and the desserts were not fantastic.
the rest of the food was pretty average.
only good thing, they had pint-sized Nutella ice cream."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here last night, and it was the last time I'll be \"taken\" again. I'd expect better quality food from The Mirage, but I was wrong. There were minimal meat selections, turkey or prime rib -- with plenty of gristle included. Mashed potatoes were cold and seemed to be from a box. Most food had little flavor or were overly salty. The Asian area of the buffet lacked quality and flavor. The only desert that was good was the bread pudding and the fresh fruit. The other deserts had no flavor. The gelato was gross and melted before I returned to the table. Too expense for crap."}
{"text":"Worst buffet in all of Las Vegas. Avoid at all costs. Everything is a shade of brown and comes from a can. No creative thought process, no demonstration of any culinary skill or art form whatsoever. If you have or like the sound of screaming children, enjoy lukewarm food that all tastes like chicken, you will enjoy Cravings. 
We thought we might like this buffet for lunch. It was around $45 USD per person; we both left feeling as if we were cattle being led to slaughter. Few healthy alternatives and supermarkets have fresher and better tasting sushi. 
By the way, how is it possible to create in edible macaroni and cheese?
Cravings buffet made this possible."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of 'Average'.  Not great. Not bad. Just average.  It's inexpensive, and even more inexpensive when you stay at the Mirage, as they give you a $40 coupon.  I probably wouldn't go here again unless I had another coupon, but they provided a decent meal and good service in a clean environment.  3 stars."}
{"text":"It's Vegas. Ain't nothing wrong with getting hammered before noon while you're still nursing last night's hangover while stuffing your face with goodies at the same time. It just makes sense.

-------
Mimosas, melt-in-your-mouth prime rib, mimosas, not-your-average-wimpy-shrimp-cocktail shrimp cocktail, mimosas, giant crab legs, mimosas, smoked salmon, more mimosas.... finish it off with AYCE gelato."}
{"text":"I will give this buffet 2 stars. I came back after 1 year and half. This place is really down grade themself. The price for weekday dinner is $29.99. They only have 2 types of seafood is crab leg hot and cold and cocktail shrimp. A small island of asian foods and stake and pizza and couples of Mexican food. I was suprised that u have to go get soft drink for myself. 
It is not worth it for $29.99 even with MyVEGAS redeem gold coins. 
I will stop writing now because I have to go get drink for my wife. I am the server myself. Ahhahaha
Oh I forgot 1 thing, ask to come inside to take a look before you pay.
I recommend please tip good the server because the plates are heavy. You have to go get drink it is not their fault. They set the rules that we have to server drink for ourself."}
{"text":"I agree that the ambiance and decor could use a little work, however for a Vegas buffet this place has everything you could want. We were pleasantly surprised to find all you can drink wine and beer included. Food stations included Chinese options, fresh shrimp, Alaskan crab legs, pasta station, and much much more. We had to take a taxi ride to try this one and we would definitely return for our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"The first thing that struck me about this buffet was that the place was cavernous..I mean Costco warehouse like.  The place is huge, and the individual stations wrap around the seating area.  I didn't know where to start first, so I retreated to my comfort zone - DESSERT STATION!!!  They have a nice arrangement of desserts.  The standouts for me were the flourless chocolate cake, fruit tart and the various gelatos.  Heaven.  The chocolate cake is so dense and sweet, I swear you will form a cavity after eating one.  Fruit tart had a lovely flaky crust and was filled with very fresh fruits.  So after packing five pounds to my fat ass, I proceeded to the other stations.  Prime rib was good (Hey Miss meatcarver lady - don't be so chintzy with the pieces please).  Sushi station was disappointing; everything looked dry.  Seaweed salad was delicious; that alone kept me coming back to the sushi station.  Crab legs and shrimp looked very fresh, however they are served out of a cubby hole carved in the wall..that was kinda weird.  Lots of various stations - cuban, mexican, vietnamese.  Lots of variety..better than most of the buffets I've been to."}
{"text":"cocktail shrimps are pretty big... bigger than the ones at Bellagio... 
lots of crab legs... food is ok here... also all you can drink, they put new machines and you just go and grab whatever you want to drink..."}
{"text":"Have been there at the Sunday brunch last year. Ended up in hospital in Page with food poison. I barely survived, because we were in the middle of nowhere, when that started. The doctor said the food poison was from pork - the only pork I had (the only meat at all in days) was the cured ham at the Mirage buffet. So in the end the buffet has cost a few thousand dollars and it took weeks to recover, thank you Mirage!"}
{"text":"Fairly good buffet with tons o' variety.    I do love the noodle bar where you can get wonton noodles and pho.   Yeah, it's not the best but I prefer over the prime rib.

What stood out were the desserts.   Oh, MAN.   Everything looked so good, I had dessert in the middle of dinner. In my world, eating sweets in between savory is illegal.  The desserts were that irresistable.   Big props to whoever makes the sugar free desserts (chocolate mousse and chocolate cake).  I tried this on a whim and boy, I couldn't tell the difference!   I also had the orange and vanilla gelato; fab as were the fantastic BREAD PUDDING.   I'd go back just for the desserts alone!"}
{"text":"Great Selection of food! They even had breakfast foods when we were there at 3pm. I'm good with just Prime Rib, my husband ate just about everything there. The crab legs soaked in a bowl of butter being his favorite. Selection of desserts is insane! Beer and wine is included on the price which I believe was $35 each, we were there on a Saturday.  I used a buy one get one free buffet from myVegas slots, so SCORE!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite buffets to eat in Vegas =) 

Place is clean and the food is pretty tasty. Plus, its near all my favorite slot machines!"}
{"text":"So, I am a HUGE Dr Pepper fan, and it is so hard to fine fountain Dr Pepper anywhere in Vegas, at least on The Strip, but here, they HAVE IT!!! So I was very happy. The buffet is not the most expensive and we went for the Champagne Brunch so it was great. Unlimited mimosas is always a good idea, especially if they will give you just the champagne without the o.j. ;) . I've been with a group and I've been with just my husband and both times it was easy to get in, not a long wait. 

The last time we went for mid morning and the buffet had good food, but didn't seem to have a whole lot of variety."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, no long lines like the horrible Palm's buffet....very friendly, wonderful staff. I really had a tough time shelling out $28 for lunch, but the great food, great experience and LOTS of really good, high-quality champagne made it all worth it. The nice lady even gave us \"to go\" cups of champagne! How cool is that!? I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Cravings: A Haiku

Not bad, but not great
Prime Rib was spot on, More please!
Rubbery Seafood"}
{"text":"Cravings has always been good to me, for the most part. In fact the last few times I was out there in Vegas. I always made it a point to make a stop here. Prices adjust throughout the day. With breakfast, brunch (with unlimited mimosas might I add) lunch, and dinner. Selection ranges from, Latin, raw bar,Chinese, Italian, carving. Of course deserts. Service is very attentive. Once in a while they have a panini sandwich station which is awesome. The gelato station hiding in the desert corner is damn good. prime rib is good. So why give it only 3 stars and not more? Well I was here a few weeks ago. And for some strange reason it just didn't satisfy. the prime rib was fatty. Some of the dishes out, weren't very fresh. The selection was very minimal. I was there during lunch time. I'm not sure what was going on that day. But it doesn't ruin my spirits to give it one more try when I go back. Otherwise I'll be force to give other buffets a try."}
{"text":"Expensive - they raised the prices $30 a person and food was mediocre at best. Crab legs were still frozen, cake was rock hard, and everything was lukewarm. Only plus side was service was attentive and plates were cleared promptly!"}
{"text":"If you like Crab legs this is the place! For the price Cravings is a very good deal. At the carving station, the Prime Rib was also tender, flavorful and fresh. The Turkey was amazing! I try to stop everytime I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why everyone is hating on this buffet. Maybe it's because they paid full price? 

We got BOGO deal through MyVegas for dinner totaling $33 plus tips for the server and bartender. 

This is one of the only few buffets that have free alcohol (tap goose IPA, bud light,  and three colors for wine).

There's a separate station for all the different food themes. There was prime rib, roast whole chicken, kielbasa sausage, shrimp,  and crab legs when we went. 

I love soup,  so I truly appreciated how each cuisines had one out two soups at their station. 

The sushi was not the best,  the rice was to mooshy and compacted. But I really enjoyed the inari, kimichi, edamame, and cucumber salad.

For Chinese the standout was the wonton soup!  Wow!

I also really liked the corn chowder from the Italian station. 

Remember to save room for dessert!  I wish I started from the dessert section. There was variations of cookies,  gelato station,  fresh fruits,  tarts,  creme brulees, mini pies, and beautifully designed pudding shooters!  Absolutely marvelous! 

Our server was very fast in clearing our never ending dirty plates,  even was helpful in planning our transportation for the night! 

The drink stations are vast, and even offer to go containers for your beer,  wine,  coffee,  or soda."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. Even though beer and wine was included it didn't make up for the poor selection and mediocre food"}
{"text":"I've been playing MyVEGAS for a while and used a reward for 2 for 1 buffet. Waitstaff was awesome . Never had a plate sit on our table for more than 2 minutes. Carving station amazing, loved the Latin and salad station. Very good fresh fruit, they will also make you toast if you ask. All breakfast items were nice and fresh, they make eggs and omelettes to order too. Dessert area looked great, but was comfortably full and didn't try the amazing looking donuts. We will definitely visit again next year and maybe try dinner also."}
{"text":"We went here Saturday for dinner. We had a 2-1 coupon. Price was $37 for two people so a good deal. 

Very large space, open layout.  Been here a few times years ago. I ate mostly the crab legs. Prime rib. 

They provide a self serve drink area, which I think is good.  You don't have to flag down a staff to get a drink when you want one. We've all been in that situation. 

Unlimited alcohol, wines and beer. They have a bar area with one bartender working and a bunch of tv's to watch or get updates on games. 

I wouldn't go out of my way, but if I was in Mirage and hungry, I'd eat there if we had another 2-1 coupon. I wouldn't spend full retail price eating there. Other buffets on the strip are better for same price points."}
{"text":"The best (in it's price range) buffet we tried in Las Vegas. Everything I tried was at least good, and a few things were straight up great. The weekend brunch has good variety and Mimosa's included. 
I rate buffet's more liberally than straight restaurants, but Craving's deserves this rating."}
{"text":"Ouch!  Really, this was painful.  Ate here for their Sunday Champagne Brunch.  First of all, they're serving J Roget for their champagne.  The stuff costs $4 a bottle so be ready for a headache if you're going all out on this stuff.  We did not as my wife and I both know better than to drink cheap champagne.  The buffet was weak in our opinion.  There is absolutely no ambiance to the place and it is grossly overpriced.  Thankfully we had a $65 credit as part of our room package so we only spent $10 with tip for the meal.  I would strongly suggest visiting the \"Pantry\" around the corner for breakfast or a different resort for their brunch.  If you do want a highlight to try out while you're there check out the cinnamon buns and the tiramisu, both were very good."}
{"text":"We had an AMAZING dinner! Everything was delicious and fresh.  They had quite a variety of foods, all you can drink beer and wine.  The desserts area I could not make up my mind.  Now that's what I call a buffet."}
{"text":"Unlimited Wine/Beer plus the excellent service gives this place a 3 stars.

But if I was to judge the buffet based on the quality of the food it might be between 1-2 stars. I didn't find myself enjoying much of anything. The food was either bland or not very fresh.

They do have a good variety here but I tried everything and the only things I really enjoyed eating was the watermelon, cheese, and the yellowtail nigiri. All three of these dishes just require being cut, not cooked -.-

The Chinese food here was not as good as a typical random Chinese buffet, which was really disappointing. Some of the chefs need to be trained to cook Chinese food, it can be fast and cooked properly.

A few fixes to the chef's cooking technique could make their food bearable, even if the quality is lacking."}
{"text":"Really great buffet!  Fresh food and lots of choices. They have Italian, BBQ, pizza, Mexican, Mediterranean, seafood (shrimp, crab legs), sushi, Chinese, panini's, gyros, lox, made to order salads, and dessert including sugar-free selections, fruit, warm cookies, cakes, and a wonderful gelato bar. 

Very good food for a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I've tried this buffet a few times many many years ago....vague memory.

Recently I used the MyVegas '2 for 1' discount to try this place out again (we were starving...so had to look for a nearby buffet).  

Pretty wide selection of cultural food, however I think overall they had way too much carbohydrate dishes.  The flavors of each dish per culture were all fairly similar too...not much flavor distinction.  The physical look of the buffet seems a bit outdated as well.  The dessert station wasn't up to par, compared to other nearby buffets.

Overall, this buffet has everything you want if you are starving! However, if it weren't for the MyVegas deal that I claimed, the quality of food here would not be worth $37/person.  There are other Vegas buffets on the strip that offer much better quality for about the same price."}
{"text":"I liked it coz whenever I played poker I used to get the comp. But unfortunately they don't have it anymore."}
{"text":"Bueno si vas por el Mirage a ver los tigres blancos de los Modern Talking del circo , puedes comer aqui.
El buffet es  correcto, no mata pero tampoco es decepcionate.
Si te gustan las gambas tengo una buena noticia para ti.. Ve a otroooo, aqui extrañamente saben a NADA
las carnes son gustosas y jugosas..
Suerte amig@"}
{"text":"I love Vegas buffets.  I think usually there isn't a huge difference between most of the main ones (Wynn, Bellagio, etc..).

But i thought Cravings, at the Mirage was a pretty good deal.  It was about $20 for brunch and there were bottomless mimosas or bloody marys.

The things I remember eating were french toast, hashbrowns, prime rib, ham, shrimp cocktail, crab legs, wonton noodles, potstickers, fruit, gelato, mango pudding, cake, and some other desserts.  They had mango pudding!!! I was so excited about that... usually don't see mango pudding at places other than chinese places.  And this wasn't the mango pudding that was like gelatin at chiense places, but it was actually pudding, soft and creamy mango pudding!! So good. 

I think i got my money's worth, i was pretty satisfied.  I also got a huge chocolate chip cookie on my way out to eat while i was gambling.

The biggest disappointment though, was the sushi.  There was barely any fish in the rolls, and thats all they had - rolls."}
{"text":"This was the first buffet my husband and I went to on our trip to Vegas. We tried most of the stations. Each had a decent selection of food. It was a good buffet. You need to get your own drinks, but it included a wine and beer bar in the price. 

I sampled a lot of the seafood and my husband tried most of the other stations. It was clean and they refilled all of the food regularly. The selection of desserts was good, and the chocolate bread pudding was one of the best things I ate that night. 

We arrived a bit early for dinner, being a little jet-lagged from coming in from the east coast, but there was a line when we left around 7, but it seemed to be moving through pretty well. I expect it would be worse later. 

Overall, a pretty good value for your dollar."}
{"text":"I loved cravings, it had everything I wanted and then some. They have so many stations, sushi, seafood, gyros, and a gelato station ( to name a few). If you want tradtional breakfast and more this place is for you. I liked it because it wasnt too gourmet, (if you want high end, then the buffet at mandalay bay is perfect.) I personally dont like eating fancy for breakfast so I stick to cravings."}
{"text":"The buffet was the best I have been to ever.  They have a large variety of food and drinks.  Wine and beer are included in the price of the buffet.  I would have eaten there everyday if I had known about this place prior to my last day.
The place is very clean and well maintained.  Line was a little long but not unreasonable.  
American, Asian, Italian food, salad bar, carving table and more
They have a discount through the local tix vendors.  Big plus, they have a 50% military discount at the counter.  Just show your ID.  I found that out when I showed up."}
{"text":"I have never done a yelp review, however I had to on this one!!!! This has to be the worst buffet I have ever been to! 
There was not a single item that was even decent to eat, everything there was worst than  eating at a hospital cafeteria. To top it off both my husband and I felt sick after eating here! 
When in Vegas you look forward to eating at a buffet, well this is not the one. Go eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"The place is amazing. .Ive been coming  with my family  for the last 2 years .. and everything. Everything  is on point. .my wife  loves the mimosas. .and my kids  love the food. .
Specially  the Italian food. .they make  on the spot for you the way they want it. Liza.. the hosted  is very friendly. .and our server  ..ricardo. is so happy to help us. .. and one of the Cooks named  steve.. made my daughters  so happy by making French fries for her!.. and special thanks you to the manager steven for make our visit  all ways a good experience here... I recommend everyone to visit and enjoy  the food"}
{"text":"The only reason we chose to eat here was because my parents and I stayed at the Mirage and this is the closest buffet.... but there's almost no reason for me to come back =(

- mediocre decor and hype
- stained containers and cutlery
- ridiculously salty crab legs
- poor selection of dessert that didn't look good to me, if u are a  dessert person, go elsewhere!!
- food from different parts of the world were served in different sessions, but they were very spread out, and it almost took me a minute to walk from the Italian session to the Japanese session! 

+ the only plus was that their prime rib was actually pretty good.

I didn't expect a lot, but for $25.95, I guess I expected it to be okay. Still, I was disappointed. We went to Paris for their lunch buffet the day after, and I felt way happier and more satisfied for just $17.99!!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre. You get what you paid for. Its cheaper of the buffets in Vegas. The biggest disappointment was the asian section and the dessert section. Selections were so limited in those sections and the desserts' qualities were no more than just any neighborhood buffet level, which is a let down considering this is Vegas. Their best section is the Italian section! Really delicious soup selections and pasta! Don't have much to say but if you're wanting to fulfill your vegas buffet fantasies, this isnt the place, go for bellagio or caesar's palace buffets. But this is a good, affordable, decent place to eat if you want to eat alot but dont really care too much about enjoying a luxurious meal."}
{"text":"Came to this buffet with my husband because I purchased a travelzoo voucher for 2 with unlimited beer & wine for about $39 total (but it's $39 or something around that per person with unlimited beer & wine). I didn't think the food was really that great. The food didn't really taste good to me, nor really appeal to me. A lot of the food was pretty dry and quite disappointing. But my husband did thoroughly enjoy his crab and shrimp though.

Anyways, like any other buffet in Vegas, there are plenty of food choices to choose from. There is a dessert section, an Asian section (pho is actually served but I didn't try it so don't know if it was any good or not), a Latin section, a carving section, a salad section, a seafood section, an Indian section and so on. The decor is nice and simple. Generally everything is pretty clean and our server was very friendly and chit chatty. She was really nice at suggesting places for us to go and asked how our stay was at the hotel we were staying at (Alexis Park Hotel, which is 1 mile away from the strip). She was great at clearing our dirty dishes quickly and refilling our drinks. She also was really nice in giving my husband a cup of beer to take with us when we finished our meal and were ready to walk off some of the weight we just gained on the strip. 

Oh and by the way, there are no restrooms inside the actual buffet but located right next door (so you will have to walk outside of the buffet and come on back... and you'll have to remind the people at the front).

For the discounted price we paid, the buffet was just fine at feeding the 2 of us. But if we were to pay the full price per person, I would rate the buffet even lower. 

Oh and in case you are wondering, I probably would not come back."}
{"text":"A good balance of price and quality equals decent value, especially taking into consideration the beer and wine bar. However, their unique beverage options is the only aspect that really stands out. With 11 stations, there's a good variety of different cuisines, but the quality of the individual items are just good enough to be on par with any decent buffet on the Strip. The positives: Value, the bbq ribs, and of course, the beer & wine bar. 
The negatives: just average quality items; and the sushi section only had 3 options for rolls (no nigiri or even California rolls), 2 of which were cream cheese rolls."}
{"text":"One of my favorite buffets in Vegas. I come here everytime. There is huge selection of dishes, and service is EXCELLENT here. I would recommend coming here if you want to enjoy a Vegas buffet. 

This buffet lives up to its name- it'll satisfy ALL your CRAVINGS =)

Personal favorites:
Shrimp cocktails (no shells!)
Crab legs
Strawberry waffles (during breakfast buffet)"}
{"text":"As far as buffets go, this one is not on my list of ones that need to be visited again.

It was early on a slow night, so there was no line at the register.  The place was practically empty.  So you would think the staff would be attentive.  But that wasn't the case.  Our waiter was slow.  And there was no one at the ice cream stand to dip so I had to wait for about 3 minutes while I yelled back \"Hello\".

The crab legs were okay (they were better at Bellagio and Aria).  The prime rib was about the only good thing there.  For a buffet called \"Cravings\" there was very little that I was craving.  It was like they were trying too hard to be different.  The only pasta in the Italian section was a filled tortellini.  Do I really need someone to toss my salad?

The only good thing is that I was able to get this comped."}
{"text":"There is a full, sit down bar with televisions IN the buffet!! Perfect for Sunday Brunch with the football-watching boys.
Excellent service in all areas.  Gold stars for the peppy, sweet lady making fresh tossed salads (Sunday 10/6), whose personality alone inclined me to get something healthy for brunch. 
Fresh squeezed OJ in our truly bottomless mimosas--they didn't ask if we wanted more, they simply refilled;)
TONS of choices, quality ingredients.  Vegetarian options including wild mushroom pizza, steamed veggies, tofu salad, miso soup.
I was excited about trying a little fish n chips but the fish was dry like jerky;(
Lesson learned: stick to veggie food.  
I never get excited about buffets, but if I was given a comp to come here again, I certainly would."}
{"text":"While this buffet isn't the cheap Buffets Vegas was once known for the food here can only be described as amazing. Forget about the spit guard buffets at other places this buffet is top notch all the way. For starters the salad station has a person there that makes your salad to order. No more people picking at everything. Also this Buffet is huge. I mean wall to wall stations with everything for Italian food to sushi. The food is similar to what you would get in a nicer sit down restaurant also. The Desserts are just as enjoyable with things such as cookies and Gelato. Also this place gets crowded during peak times so I don't recommend coming here during peak times as you will have to wait.  So far still my favorite Buffet in Vegas."}
{"text":"I give it FOUR stars because of the atmosphere!
The food was alright.  But I definitely would go here again.  It is better than the RIO buffet!  Selection was alright.  I do not recommend the sushi.  Stay away from the alfredo dish from the pasta bar area.
I basically ate CRAB and beef marsala.
I definitely LOVED their dessert selection!  WAY TO GO!!!
Our server was not happy to be there."}
{"text":"Had not been back to the Mirage in awhile. The buffet was totally remodeled, much more spacious. You could get your own drinks which was great!! The crab legs were hot, as was the butter!! Yum!! They were cut open to make it easy to extract the meat!! The Asian food was great too. The won ton noodle soup was very tasty, as were the sel mei, pot stickers and egg rolls. often times at other restaurants,  they are not. The vegetable chow mein was spot on too. There was a large variety of pizza, although a bit too doughy for me. There is even a cappuccino machine. Have to compare it to the Rio tomorrow night."}
{"text":"Full disclosure -- I find Vegas to be the cesspool of the United States and I only come here for the many conference I need to attend for my job.

I ended up at Cravings because it was next to impossible to find a restaurant at either the Venetian or Palazo that was within the guidelines of my company's meal expense guidelines.  Can someone explain to me why a meal at Morels in the Palazo is 50% more than the Morels in LA?  Worse service and food for 50-100% more than other parts of the country?   

Anywho, everything was overcooked, the selections were sparse and I felt  that they had used the cheapest ingredients possible to make money."}
{"text":"Great food and good service. Had all you can drink beer and wine. The seafood is tops. I will be back. A little pricey but you pay for what you get."}
{"text":"With Vegas buffets what get you get depends on when you go. 

It's definitely above average whenever you go but is it best? hard to tell BUT they do have superior variety....for sunday brunch i'd bet they can hit the top!"}
{"text":"Felt this buffet was below average for a vegas buffet. Not a large selection of food, the place was dated and food didn't look appetizing. The only good thing was unlimited beer and wine for dinner."}
{"text":"Had a very nice dinner on 4/30/2014 getting one comped dinner using my MLife and myVegas redemptions. Don't forget to process your redemptions at the MLife players card desk first. Got there about 6:00PM and the wait time was very short. Interesting that you can serve yourself drinks and they even have a regular bar in the buffet area. Food was very good overall and salad actually mixed for you, if you want. Shrimp, fish, and veggies were excellent. Only thing that I was slightly disappointed in was their cheeses. I didn't expect a varied selection of cheeses but since it was there, I was excited. But, most of the cheese selections were pretty bland and it appeared had been sitting out for awhile. Decent buffet that I very likely will visit again."}
{"text":"We came for the brunch and some random things really stood out. 

The fish and chips were surprisingly amazing. I don't really like fish and chips, but my momma told me I had to try them, and shoot momma, they were good! 

The seafood gumbo/soup was also awesome. It came in small bowls with corn. 

The french toast and cinnamon bread thing was DELICIOUS.

The pizza was ok, the desserts were decent, and the fresh fruit was great! 

Unlimited beer and mimosas was definitely a plus!"}
{"text":"We decided to come to this buffet because we had a buy one get one free coupon courtesy of myVEGAS. At first the buffet looks like it has a large selection, but it isn't too big. It's about $35 a person and comes with unlimited beer and wine. For beer they have bud light and an IPA. For wine they have a really good moscato and then a few other selections if you like less sweet wine. It is self serve for the drinks. The food was okay. I really liked the create your own pasta station where the guy cooks for you. Other than that, I wasn't too impressed. A couple hours after eating there, I broke out in a rash all over my body. Not sure if it was an allergic reaction or an ingredient in one of their foods."}
{"text":"Get the champagne brunch.

The buffet has a wide selection, ranging from cheeses to pastries, crepes, Mexican food, seafood and everything in between. They always have prime rib with either turkey or ham. 

The service is good.

The setting feels more like a restaurant than a buffet. It's priced about right, not too cheap to where you feel unsafe eating it and not too expensive to turn you away. There's also never a ridiculously long line.

Great for groups!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst buffet. Everything is low quality and especially disguating. Stay away."}
{"text":"The food is good.... But this Yelp is about the service!!! Walking up to check in and pay.. Used my USAA card and she asked us \"are you military?\"  We haven't been asking for military or veteran discounts ever recently. This was a happy surprise. And it was 50% off for this discount! To recognize our USAA card and the discount. Then the food have so many options.. And beer and wine were complimentary... Amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"So we were hungry and we were looking for a legit buffet so we decided to check this place out. When we went it was not crowned at all. There was no line to pay so we headed straight up to the registered and payed the entrance fee. 

We were seated by a nice lady and we started to grub. I think it was crab legs night so that's what we all went for first. We all grabbed a plate load of crab legs with butter and munched on those for a good while. They had other stuff like some sushi stuff that i ate, but it was all about the crab legs. 

For dessert that had a little gelato bar so i got some of each flavor. They had the little dessert treats that were so-so...so i didn't really eat any of those. 

Overall the service was good. Whenever i left an empty plate on the table, it was picked up by the time i got back with a new plate. I ordered an ice tea and i can say it was never empty. Also it was very clean and it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I love buffets!  I love being able to try 100 different items all in one meal.  I even love the \"I want to puke\" feeling that comes after a visit to a buffet.  I am not even bothered with the generally mediocrity of food on buffets.

That said, I found Cravings to be a disappointment. It has about 10 different ethnic stations with each station having a handful of food options.  

In general, the food offered was even blander than I find at my local Golden Coral.  I also felt like the number of dish options was less than you usually see at a Vegas buffet.  The price is similar to the Wynn  Buffet, but not nearly as good.  

Some of the highlights- Had a good Latin station with a bunch of different salsas.  Also enjoyed the Chinese pork buns with many different sauces.  The highlight of the meal was the Gelato bar.  I enjoyed 5 different flavors dipped in 6 different sauces.  YUM!

Overall- definitely don't come here if you don't generally like buffets. It will live-up to all of your negative opinions of buffets.  If you love buffets, there are so many in Vegas, why come to this mediocre one."}
{"text":"If you are a simpleton and like basic foods, this is the place for you.  I normally like to explore foods of a higher culinary expertise, though I do still appreciate the basics.  If you fit this category, read on..

I was visiting Las Vegas with my parents and trying to show them why the buffets here are impressive, and after searching Yelp for the right one, I chose Cravings.  We were there at about 8pm on a Saturday night.  There was no line, which probably should have been an indication that it wasn't great, but at that point we had been looking for the \"perfect\" buffet and were just tired of searching.

They had a wide variety of categories to choose from: Italian, carved meat, Latin, Mediterranean, Seafood, Sushi, Chinese and Salad.  However, within each category was the most basic of each food.  

Italian: Pizza, pastas with either marinara or alfredo sauces. (I was hoping for fire baked crust and made-to-order pizzas, rather than old, hard cheese and meat)
Carved meat: Prime rib or Turkey (where was the sirloin steak and 
Latin: Texas chili (not Latin!), tamales, and enchiladas
Mediterranean: pita bread, babaganoush, hummous.  (that's it??)
Seafood: chilled cocktail shrimp and crab legs (they were too salty) and baked tilapia and salmon (typical)
Chinese: stir friend veggies, beef chow mein, fried rice, orange chicken (comparable to Panda Express)
Salad: romaine lettuce with your choice of dressing, and vegetable toppings (I was hoping for fruit toppings and candied nuts)

And for dessert:  only a couple of selections of pie: dutch apple, raspberry chocolate silk, lemon merengue, and sugar free cheesecakes.  Throw in a few choices of rock-hard cookies and fresh fruit.

I was expecting much more, to say the least.  I probably won't be coming back again, with or without my parents.  They weren't really impressed and we all felt that money spent on food did not match the quality.

This being said, I have been to the buffet at Aria, and was much more impressed... See Aria for further review."}
{"text":"I can't find anything wrong with the place.  I good selection of food and desserts.  I ate for free with a credit from the hotel from a summer special offered at the website.  Even it it wasn't free, the price made the meal worth it, seeings as the food is better and more affordable then other buffets."}
{"text":"My girls went here after the pool to go eat.  

Unfortunately I dont remember. 

I blacked out and asked to leave.  My friend was able to eat and then take me back to the hotel.  

I know I ate something.. but I ended up getting sick from all the alcohol. LOL. 

I know, my fault for getting drunk, but I did pay to eat.. I deserve something if I invest money in someone's business."}
{"text":"35 a person....worth it though.They had all sorts of food,their omlette bar was the bomb digity and the staff is excellent.They kept bringing us mimosas and making sure our plates were cleared away.We went there twice.
Oh they have tiny little desserts that are really yummy,ice cream etc..."}
{"text":"I'm inclined to go lower on my rating, but I have to review the buffet for what it is, a buffet.

First thing, they GOUGED us on price because it was Memorial Day weekend.  My girlfriend paid, so I didn't see the cost til it was too late.  That put a bit of a damper on things, because I was ticked from the get-go.  I don't even want to say what we paid, because it's embarrassing.  We really should have walked out and gone to STK or something, it wouldn't have been much more.

So, let's start with the \"good\": Our server was VERY nice!  She was a doll and should really be serving somewhere better.  The pot-stickers and shrimp/pork dumplings were edible.  In fact, with a little Sriracha, they were pretty good.  The chilled shrimp and crab legs, on this day, were perfect.  The legs weren't huge but they were nicely split and easy to access the meat, so it made them easy to eat.  I really should have just stopped there.  OH, actually, the prime rib was decent.  Actually, when we got some fresh out of the over, it was really tasty.  Cooked just right, amazingly enough.  There, I should have stopped there.

The \"bad\": The chinese food was crap.  Worst garlic beef, ever.  Chewy, nasty pieces of meat and the sauce was like gelatin.  The breakfast options must have been sitting out for hours.  The eggs had a crust on them 1/2\" thick.  I couldn't even force myself to get any.  The bacon had been sitting for a while too and had gotten soggy.  HOW does bacon get soggy???  And the desserts?  If it wasn't for some OK gelato, I would have gone all Hulk on this place for the crap desserts.  The chocolate cheesecake actually made me physically sad.  And then the \"key lime pie\" made me really mad.  Bah, I don't want to talk about this anymore, it's just depressing me.

My recommendation, avoid the buffets.  Unless it's at a very high end establishment and they have freshly prepared food items, it's just not worth it.  Oh, and it wrecked me, my girlfriend and her kids for two days.  Thanks for the GI tract cramping, Cravings buffet!"}
{"text":"Loved it.  Got up late and ate a great breakfast/brunch.  A lot of eggs, prime rib, pork products and a bunch of other tasty items.  
They have a omelet bar and booze included.
Be very nice to the staff and you might get a 2for1 special.  
Worth every penny as I did not eat until very late in the evening after gorging."}
{"text":"At this buffet I received perhaps the best service I have ever experienced. As a person with multiple food allergies, I usually dread these things because I never know what I can eat, but my family wanted to go. It turned out that the assistant manager, Kent, and the executive chef, Jeffrey, personally walked me from station to station, describing the ingredients in each item, and offering to make me something if necessary. They were very busy but did not make me feel like they were putting them out in any way. Their kindness was so appreciated.

Not only that, the food was very good, and it turned out that I got plenty to eat. ALL of us were happy!

I recommend this buffet to anyone, but if you have dietary restrictions, this place is great because of the staff."}
{"text":"I love this place. For a little over $20 on the weekends, you get access to a more food than is imaginable and unlimited champagne and bloody marys. Heaven. 

They have everything you could ever want to eat on your break from the blackjack table: sushi, crab legs, eggs, bacon, oysters, shrimp, omelets, chicken, steak, chinese food, and more....I could go on forever!

And, they're very generous about the all-you-can drink specials, which is good because I'm about as good at gambling as I am at dieting, and when I go to Vegas, I'm apt to lose a few $$$. But the food makes up for it all."}
{"text":"We opted to go to this buffet based on the bang for your buck. It was a very dull environment, no one seemed to really be enjoying themselves at the tables around us. Though as far as the food is concerned, the prime rib was pretty good. We ordered a lobster (in addition to the meal) which was a nice touch but not the best I've ever had. There were stations including Italian food, Meat carving (Turkey, Prime Rib and Pork Loin), Mexican (my boyfriend highly suggests the fried plantains with chimichurri sauce), Southern Cooking (with pretty good ribs), a seafood section with shrimp and crab legs, a disappointing sushi section and an Americanized Chinese section, a cold cut, bread roll and cheese section and lastly a dessert section. Alcoholic drinks are not complimentary (some buffets do have wine and beer inluded).... 

My opinion is that when you go to a buffet you pay for a variety of mediocre food.. so it's quantity and variety over quality.

Personally, I think in the future I'd rather save my money to go to a restaurant and have one meal of higher quality."}
{"text":"CRAVINGS BUFFET
This is a decent buffet in the Mirage at Las Vegas. It's definitely improved over the years. I recall going there as a kid in the early 90's, where I met tennis star, Michael Chang, and got his autograph. Wide variety of foods here, but fast forward to 2008 and beyond, where the Cravings Buffet has expanded and vastly improved. There is quite an international feel to the buffet, ranging from Americano to Mexicano to Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese). Lots of cut meats to choose from and plenty of soups to try! Desserts included cakes, tarts, bread pudding, and a gelato bar! Drinks are free, so drink up if you're into fruit juices: orange, cranberry, apple, etc. Service was great too, as they servers regularly cleaned our tables and refilled our drinks. The food is arrayed around the the dining area in a wide circular arc, making you walk a bit to find your favorite foods (a little exercise within the buffet compound). Not a bad buffet in Las Vegas. Not the best, but hey, it's not Bellagio!"}
{"text":"This buffet has designated areas: bbq, chinese, latin, italian, etc.  Chinese is always great.  So is italian and japanese.  The bbq is hit and miss.  The seafood is fresh.  They have a mongolian type bbq set up for noodle dishes.  Custom salads too.  Gelato is good.  Deserts are awesome!  Just had a raspberry macaroon tart this past weekend.  Wow.  Super Yum.  Beverages are always filled on time...no real waiting on refills."}
{"text":"No complaints for Cravings, really! I've eaten here twice, both times for a weekend brunch & I love that the selection is not too overwhelming. Organized set-up for the food because it is simply a large oval & nothing in the middle besides tables. The food quality is good. 95% of everything I tried, from the pizza to dimsum, were all delicious. 

One thing I did not like was their Spicy Tomato Soup. Holy ishhhh, one slurp tasted like a whole bottle of hot sauce. I understand it had to be spicy but it didn't have to be dsfhdkjhsdfkgjfskjldSPICYYYYYY! Besides that one particular item, I liked their food.

Don't forget the extensive dessert selection, tucked in the corner. I think I ate too much of the Creme Brulee because it was SO yummy! Really cute arrangement for the sweets but ice cream flavors could definitely improve. They need more, I think.

Overall, it's a good place for a buffet. But don't expect it to be Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon-esque. Those are the big league of buffets. I consider this the minor league but consistently yummy food so I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"The service  and presentation were good, for once, at a buffet. The food on the other hand was just unimpressive. It wasn't as bad as the buffet at Paris, which is a completely different review. The buffet offered lots of cheap food nicely presented and most items lacked a palatable meat component. The bowtie pasta had no meat, the hunan chicken was mostly vegetables. This is a review of the champagne brunch only so maybe they held back until dinner time.

I arrived back to my table only to notice the plate was full of low quality sausage and carbs. Where the heck was the meat? Did I miss a whole section? I don't like prime rib at a buffet, considering you can't throw a stick without hitting a steakhouse in Vegas so I came here for variety.  I can't eat shellfish so I lost 2 out of 9 whole sections there.

Cravings offers a mid-range price for middle of the road tastes and satiates a seafood fix, but otherwise I'd pass.

Lastly, I did use a TravelZoo deal and was unaware they charge you tax on top of the deal. It wasn't the fact that it was $2 extra it was partly the fact they waited til I got to the door to tell me and the cashier was useless. She immediately states \"want to speak to a manager?\" as if it's not her problem and she has no explanation. Why bother? Does anyone else feel like whenever a place uses deal sites the service and selection changes?"}
{"text":"Love this buffet. With a 2/1 coupon from MyVEGAS it's a really good deal.

Go for the lunch or the dinner. I went to both.

The biggest difference is crab. If you want crab, go to dinner. Oh and ribs! They have delicious ribs at night.

Super solid prime rib

And 

Unlike other buffets your ticket for entry includes unlimited beer/wine!

And yes there's free wifi inside so you can hang out all day (2 hour max)"}
{"text":"Food: 5 stars, everything was very good
Service: 4 stars, good for a buffet
Champaign: 1 star.  Hardly able to sip it down.
Full bar:  5 Start, their IPA was good.

Buffets have gotten so expensive these days, its kinda crazy.  I'm happy at an all you can eat sushi bar with bottomless beers for $24.99 but not on the strip.  I'll be back as there is plenty to eat that I did not try.  Worth a shot if you are there, but expect to pay about $100 for 3 people and think if this is the right choice."}
{"text":"Holy desserts batman! Came here for brunch and it was so damn good. Price was a bit up there but it met the quality of the food and free mimosas and champagne. Just about everything we put on our plate was delish! I couldn't be happier with the whole experience. Our server was a bit short but she wasn't rude or anything, I chalked that up to she was really busy (The place was almost full when we walked in). The husband and I have date night tonight so we'll be visiting for dinner..I'll update and let ya'll know how that part is."}
{"text":"We did not have a good experience here. The food was mediocre at best which actually isn't the reason why I am giving this place a poor review. We have eaten at tons of buffets and the food in general tends to be just so so (with some exceptions). Some dishes are fairly decent but most just alright. What this buffet truly does more poorly than any other here in Vegas is service. We were a large party (16) and of course had to pay 18% gratuity upfront. Ok, fine. Many of the people in our group work in the service industry in restaurants so we expected the upfront tipping. We have been paying this upfront 18% all weekend and have had really great service at the restaurants we have been to. However, our \"server\", who got tipped over 100 dollars, informed us that if we want the beer, coffee, sodas, or bloody Marys that came with the meal, we had to go and get them ourselves. The bartender where you got the bloody Marys was extremely snippy making it unpleasant to go up and get a drink. Our server couldn't be anywhere to be found. We had to wait and wait (many of us waiting over 20 minutes) to get champagne (which was one of the few  things our server could actually serve us) and she rarely cleared the dirty plates. Our plates sat and sat in front of us. So she got 100 dollars but didn't have to bring food or most beverages to the table and didn't clear the dishes until we had a couple piled in front of each of us. A member in our group finally went to find her and spoke to her and she made slightly more effort but it was, all in all, a pretty bad experience. I highly suggest to spend a little more and go to the Belaggio or the Wynn where both the food and the service is so much better than here. Paying a server that much money for basically clearing a few plates is ridiculous."}
{"text":"I loved the Champagne Brunch at Cravings.   I was able to crawl out of my hotel bed and right into brunch.

Saturday morning for around $25 they offer a fantastic UNLIMITED Champagne brunch with every food type imaginable. 

They had all sorts of yummy Asian choices, a full breakfast area, three huge stations of crab legs, a meat carving station and a full dessert station with a huge assortment of gelato.

I was in hangover heaven.  The breakfast items were great and the pastries were yummy, but I would avoid the sushi (super dry)  The servers were super friendly and very quick with the mimosa refills! By the end of the brunch my friends and I each had three full mimosa glasses that they let us take TO-GO even topping off our cups on the way out. 

Now that's the way to do it!! 

Thanks to Cravings I was stuffed and on my way with a few afternoon cocktails :)"}
{"text":"It would be more if my kid didn't have a melt down and I didn't have to leave before trying both sides.  HUGE selection and loved that it was wine and beer included!"}
{"text":"At the Cravings buffet located at the Mirage in Las Vegas and we found this piece of rubber glove in our food! An apology and a refund was offered, however the manager on duty \"Ms Anderson\" was very rude when she saw that we were posting this.  I think the worst part was as we we're leaving a \"chef\" came running up with a rubber glove and said \" look this isn't even one of our gloves, this must have come from the proceeding plant\". So this thing went from the processing plant to the hotel buffet, cooked/reheated, then presented for serving and nobody noticed? We are glad we didn't find the piece of finger that was probably in the glove end!"}
{"text":"I went to Cravings craving some king crab legs (and since we were going to watch The Beatles Love after dinner), and instead got some overly salty, thawing legs. Sadness. 

The other reviews were right in that some of the food was cold. I would think everything should be HOT since I got there right around peak dinner time. Their idea of Italian food is basically pizza and 2 kinds of pasta, but fine, I understand risotto or ravioli is too much to ask for at a buffet setting. The sushi looked old and stale so I didn't even bother, but the Chinese dim sum stuff was good (in comparison). I liked the prime rib and crab bisque until I realized they used imitation crab. C'mon! Can't a girl get some fresh and real crab meat??? Maybe I just got spoiled by the Wynn buffet but I'd happily spend $15 more next time going there instead."}
{"text":"Don't come here, it is a rip off! You pay $30/person for poor quality canned/frozen food. They had no variety of food and the food tasted bland and horrible! You are better off going to a Hometown Buffet or cafeteria . It was depressing coming here, we were expecting quality , variety and delicious food from a really nice hotel, let alone one on the Las Vegas strip."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast again, and it just does not do it for me.  Self serve beverages, and outside the fresh eggs prepped, it needs a quality upgrade.  No longer any bowls of fresh berries,and the entire dessert section is beyond horrible 
I'll walk to the Bellagio and get something good if I want a decent buffet"}
{"text":"I like this place.

I went here for dinner with my gf the night we arrived in vegas for valentine's day weekend, and I was very pleased at the selection of stuff they had to offer.  Though I didn't think much of the 10 dollar lobster/steak deal, I did find the gelato option and the \"chef prepared\" salad that they had to offer.  I also liked that the buffet appeared to offer a ton of selections, for the first thirty minutes I didn't even notice that the buffet circled around the eating area.

I left this place very full and very pleased.  I should mention that I haven't eaten at many buffets in vegas--but between the ones I've gone to, this place beats mgm grand's hands down."}
{"text":"I was scared at paying $25 for brunch on the weekends, but on the strip, this is one of the better deals. Sushi, crab legs, shrimp, comfort food, an all-out bakery, and a gelato bar. Free champagne or mimosa with the deal.

Epic win. The only issue is I ate so much, I had to loosen my belt 2 notches.

It was worth it."}
{"text":"I completely agree with Grace L. because I was with her.  Haha, she beat me to it!  Anyway, I got the champagne brunch at noon on Saturday and got my big sis the regular brunch... ($5 difference or so)  Total was around $50.  This was the nicest buffet I have been to, in my professional (haha) opinion.  

I was pretty much expecting waffles and eggs, but lo and behold: sushi, kimchee, chinese, dim sum, pho & wonton soup/noodle station, seafood, salad bar, mexican, italian, desserts galore, a gelato STATION...

I filled up on shrimp cocktail, daikon salad, sushi, dim sum, freshly prepared pho, fruit, more fruit, and hazelnut gelato.  I want to pout because I can't come back whenever I want...only the next time I want to brave Vegas again.  Thank you Grace for finding this buffet!!"}
{"text":"The worst experience ever. Never stay here or dine here. Worst customer service and people."}
{"text":"Come here for lunch, pass on dinner.

Cravings has been a permanent fixture on my buffet outings during my last couple of Vegas trips. They get the salad done right (just tell them easy on the dressing) and the duck noodle soup here is good.

I am not a big fan of their sushi- the rice is not made properly and it definitely gets you more full than you'd want to. 

There usually isn't  a line here so that's a plus. Pretty average buffet in my opinion."}
{"text":"Being that two buffets were included as part of out package, we had breakfast here. Not than a Best Western breakfast! The choices were limited and average at best. At least the fruit was fresh. PASS"}
{"text":"Disgusting, I have been there before  and it was great, not anymore.  The food was horrible, not a good selection.  Very surprised for being a high end resort.  I felt like Golden Corral had a better food line up.  Not worth $32."}
{"text":"This was one of the better buffets at various MGM hotels I tried during the recent trip. I went for lunch late afternoon and have to say I was impressed by the quality of the different food options, the variety and also the actual taste. Pricing was reasonable as well. Everything is pretty much self serve incl beverages so in case it's important for you, the whole tipping matter is not coming into play here.

I came quiet late when lunch was almost over and could stay into the dinner time without any additional charge. I like the Mirage and the buffet is just another reason to stay on property a bit longer."}
{"text":"Price is fair for a buffet dinner, and the best thing are the Prawn and crab legs.  Surprisingly they sever wine and beer and makes the meal more complete.  The downside is their food variety is not that much and the sushi section is almost non-existent, but can't complain as they are not charging the premium price like Caesar Palace.
Not crowded, so it is a very cozy place to have dinner."}
{"text":"The best buffet in Vegas. A great assortment of Asian food, seafood, American fare and desserts."}
{"text":"There are different stations such as Asian, Italian, shusi, etc. the concept sounds good BUT in practice the Mirage fell flat. The stations are small the food is at times cold and dry. The seafood station had crab legs that should have been thrown back for being too small. Salad bar was small as was the dessert bar. Main Street Station downtown has a much better buffet at 1/2 the price. 
Here's a tip if you are with your family with kids dont waste your money. This place will give your kids a reason to question your decision making process."}
{"text":"Oh my God! I think I have found my new favorite buffet in Las Vegas. Move aside Spice Market (PH/Aladdin) and Bellagio Buffet (the two other top buffets on the Las Vegas strip IMO)....Cravings is where it's at. Very short or even no line (didn't really matter for us either way because we had line passes as guests of the hotel) that immediately puts Cravings a step ahead of Spice Market and Bellagio Buffet where the line waits would easily be 30-60 minutes.   Pricing for dinner was under $30 which I think puts it right on par with Spice Market and cheaper than Bellagio.

  Food quality and variety. I think Cravings actually had way more variety than any other buffet I've seen. Gyros, Wonton noodle soup, salads, soups, ice cream...whoops I mean GELATO!!!, desserts, pasta, pizza, and of course prime rib and all you can eat Alaskan king crab legs. Now how's the quality...okay I'm going to put the quality of their food somewhere between Bellagio and Spice Market Buffet. Which for the same price as Spice Market is a damn good deal.

  Service also was excellent, even considering our party of eight. Atmosphere, ambience and cleanliness also felt right on par with Bellagio. I'll admit Spice Market feels a bit dingy, but Cravings had a nice atmosphere to it.

  Anyway with all said above. Cravings is now my #1 buffet in Las Vegas. Good price, no line, excellent variety and quality of food, good service, and nice atmosphere. I mean what else could you ask for.

{"text":"Came here for buffet on our last night in Las Vegas, the selection is good for the price you paid, we bought a 30% off coupon at the Tix4tonight for the buffet. The main reason we wanted buffet is for the crab legs, they have the snow crab legs that serve in steamed or cold."}
{"text":"Not worth it at all! Food was bland and boring. Definitely not fresh. Severely disappointed with the selection and quality. Save your money and go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Came during thanksgiving and boy was it slow.  I've come before for champagne brunch with friends and that was a 5 star affair, this time it was a 3, so i'll meet in the middle at 4.

Prime rib is great here and the crab legs are typically pretty good and cut in half already for you.  Crab legs arent old or anything (or still frozen) and they have taste to them unlike bad ones you get that are dry or flavorless.  Prime rib was served and cut perfectly medium rare. 

The variety of japanese sushi stuff is pretty weak, and the chinese is just okay.  I do enjoy the cheese/meat area though and some of the other seafood and bbq choices are okay as well.  I'll be back on a brunch morning :)."}
{"text":"Best value for a buffet on the strip. Not amazing food, but it's the only place on the strip that isn't expensive. Wait time is not bad either. Not an amazing selection, but again it's not expensive, it's not busy, and it is on the strip."}
{"text":"Love It! Been here a few times and it's always amazing! Recommend if in Las Vegas. It's in the Mirage which is so pretty inside too! Great experience"}
{"text":"Wow, everything was cold, hard or just really poor produce.  Sushi, the rice was hard.  Crab was cold, the produce was truly sad and should not have been put out.  The pineapple was not ripe, and the watermelon is way past it's season.  I ate a salad, some cold adamant and had to pass on all the vegetables, since dripping in butter.  
Excellent point, all the beer and wine you  want"}
{"text":"Good service (I think our sever name was Rhonda?) She was super friendly. We went during brunch and for brunch the food options was pretty amazing. I usually don't eat much but man, I was so full. I really enjoyed the carved bacon for all you bacon lovers  they also had vanilla cappuccino which was very good, poured it over ice so made myself iced latte/ coffee whatever you call it."}
{"text":"I came here on Monday night with my family. The food at the buffet isn't bad, it's decent. However, I had just gone to the Bachannal Buffet (at Ceasar's Palace) the night before, and had high expectations for this buffet. I love that buffet so much I'm pretty much biased when comparing it to any other buffet. My first indication that it wouldn't be like Bachannal should've been the fact that there was no wait to get seated. 

All the way in the back of the buffet is the beverage machines and a bar where they give out complimentary beer and wine.
 
There is a variety of food to choose some. On the left side you have American, Italian, Pizza, Seafood, Soup, and the Meat Carving Station. On the right side of the buffet there is Chinese, Sushi, Salad, and Dessert; the usual that you will get at a buffet. 

The best part of my meal was probably the dessert - yum"}
{"text":"For a large buffet, their selection is very limited.  The overall quality and number of offerings in not comparable to the better buffets in town. 

Getting your own drinks is so inconvenient and such a hassle for anyone with kids and older folks and basically anyone who does not want to have to cross half a football field to get a drink.  INstead of placing drink stations around the buffet they have them all on one wall the furthest away from the entrance and food. 

Since adding the beverage machines, they lost a lot of their more interesting offerings. Very little in terms of vegetables or fresh and interesting salads. Food is all lukewarm and pizza is ALWAYS cold and congealed. 

The crab legs and free wine and beer during the week is nice. 
The sushi station is pretty much worthless. They should get rid of it as they offer inedible sushi that people take and throw away.
Pasta station has ONE pasta dish and no other selections.

The tall blond woman manager is always scowling at guests and makes it uncomfortable to go there. 

MANAGEMENT: Please ask your staff to focus on making sure the food is not cold and make sure the pizza is fresh and hot? Can you try to add a few more dishes to what is offered?"}
{"text":"Cravings, like The Mirage as a whole,  is FAR BELOW the standard of quality one tends to expect from the better known hotels on the Las Vegas Strip. I cannot fathom how anyone could give this place above one star. My only guess would be that those reviewers just spent a decade or more in prison, and Cravings was the first place they decided to eat upon being released. 

My boyfriend and I took samples from the majority of the stations and did not find one morsel of quality food. My slice of prime rib was full of fatty pockets, my steamed rice was stale and hard. I mean, seriously, how does one go about messing up steamed rice?? The pizza was flavorless with crust like cardboard and sauce that tasted like ketchup with basil in it. You could find better quality food at Jack in the Box at 3 in the morning on a tuesday night.

The one good thing I can say about this place is that our waiter, Dan was very nice and our drinks were always filled. Good looking out Dan, you're a diamond in some deep, DEEP rough.

To sum up my experience at Cravings Buffet at The Mirage in two words: NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. Unless you liked school cafeteria food. It's $30+per person, cheap brands of beer and wine is included. They don't replace empty containers very often. There were a lot of soda selections. The deserts were tasty. The food at nearby Pantry was also marginal. Tom Choliccio's Steak House was AMAZING. Emeril's at MGM was also great. Hells Kitchen was terrible."}
{"text":"We went here for Champagne Brunch. It was pretty good. The price includes unlimited champagne and/or unlimited mimosas (orange juice and champagne), so it was a GREAT deal.  We had a pretty big party and our waitress was reallly nice and didnt seem to mind constantly bringing us refills for our mimosas and champagne glasses.  As for the food, a few of the things that I can remember are crab legs, shrimp, some sushi, gyros (yum!), paininis, and other basic buffet foods.  They had a pretty good selection of international dishes, so if all you really want is american food, I wouldn't recommend this buffet.  Since it was brunch, they also had breakfast foods and dessert!  They even had gelato, yes gelato!  

Overall, we had a really good experience, and would definitely come back to this buffet for champagne brunch!"}
{"text":"There are several stations and at lunch one and a half are dedicated to prolonging breakfast, even at 2PM. Even on the VIP line I waited around 10minutes as people fumbled for the right cards and ID to get their appropriate discounts. Upon entering they advised that house beer and wine were free. A very nice touch if you're consuming. 

The first station was omelettes, the second station was pizza. Breakfast, pineapple, pepperoni and grilled chicken. Worried that I may not see anything better I grabbed two small rectangles of the grilled chicken. 

The next station had eggs Benedict, French toast and condiments for it. I passed. 

Next station was prime rib and ham! Yes now we're talking. I was 3rd on line and though the first person had a slice of ham covered in gravy there was a debate as to which gravy the server in Chefs clothing had slathered atop it. He did not speak English and her questions were received with pointing and grunts. She returned the plate started again and pointed to the gravy she preferred. The second gentleman picked ham no topping and finally it was my turn. Prime rib rare please! The good news is it registered in the little English he knew, the bad is he carved me off a paper thin slice. I'm not going to keep the 3 people behind me waiting any longer so I moved to the mashed potatoes and corn, which were the height of my meal at Cravings. So good I grabbed seconds. I was able to enjoy my prime rib in one single bite. Like a slice of roast beef at the deli counter. 

Even though I would've liked more meat the carving board was 5 deep so I slithered in and grabbed a spoonful of potatoes and corn and made it to the next station of mexican dishes. Rice, chips, salsa guacamole and fried potato wedges? Pass

They had soup at the next station and I grabbed some New England Clam Chowder. It was very good. As many clams as potatoes. The next and last before the deserts was oriental that had rice, sushi, wontons and pot stickers. I had everything but the rice and enjoyed all of it. 

For $26 in Vegas it's worth it and I'm certain that as Mirage offers great comps that I'll be back. Just don't expect service at the carving station."}
{"text":"Eat dinner here last night and breakfast this morning. Food is terrible it's cold and has NO flavor. Item dried out and either not labeled or labeled wrong. The chief should be ashamed to put out this food. Please chief taste things before you put them out."}
{"text":"The food taste wise is good. But everything was lukewarm or cold. At $40 a person, that's unacceptable. Very disappointing..."}
{"text":"Great price for Dinner and free beer, service is always great, selection is great not to much like Rio not to pricey like Wynn, food quality is good if you been to Vegas you know what the buffets have already."}
{"text":"As buffets go this place is just so so.   The price is a bit high for what you're actually getting.  There's a lot of choices but their segmented into different ethnic areas with odd pairings.  The layout is confusing at best.  For example... the eggs, sausage, and hash browns are in one area but the bacon and toast are in a totally different area.

The pizza is horrible, just horrible.  The only good thing I found was the Eggs Benedict.  You can pay and extra $5 for open bar, but watch out for the mimosas... they're awful. 

You can experience all this awfulness for the low low price of $35 per person.  

I've been to several buffets at different large hotels in Vegas but this one was the worst of the bunch so far.  One of my favorites is the Mandalay Bay Buffet.  It's a little less expensive and the food is MUCH better."}
{"text":"Great experience to have a nice Buffett in Las Vegas! 
This is one of my sons favorite eateries! As for me it's a multi- national food emporium that includes Asian, Latino, Italian, American, and a seafoods and carving stations! Of course it's a help yourself place s very cafeteria style! They also have a bar where house wines and tap beer are included but you can get a mixer if you want the extra charge. I was impressed with the quality of the food and the amount of choices and each section had its own seasoned specialties! 
My family always gets a kick out of how I eat at a Buffett but I am not a waster but I am a taster and I try to take a small taste of as many main menu items as I can! I can honestly say there was a few I did miss here! 
My son does recommend the Crab legs if he left any! 
The people who waited our tables were very attentive to keep us uncluttered and often asked if our waters need refilling!  It's a great place if your thinking your ready to pig out in Vegas!"}
{"text":"very good selection of international food!  food is better than other buffets of the same price range (~$25 plus tax). some dishes were good. others were okay. good service"}
{"text":"A buffet is a buffet is a buffet.

Well, almost.

We stayed at the Mirage, and received two vouchers for the buffet.  At about roughly $25 per head, we were happy to get in for free.

We came in on a Sunday around 4, and the place was pretty empty.  Drinks were brought quickly and consistently to our table.

The overall look of the buffet is very modern, very clean.  Stations were spaced out and organized neatly.  There were large options, from seafood, to chinese, to italian, etc., etc.  

The food was good!  The seaweed salad was insanely delicious.  I had some veggie sushi, some shrimp, baked salmon...  Finished my meal off with bread pudding and a coconut macaroon.  My husband had and enjoyed the prime rib.

The only thing we noticed - you might be better off coming here when it is actually busier, because it looked like a lot of the food had been sitting for a bit.  Busier buffet = higher turnover on the food!!!

Anyhow, worth coming to for sure, and we look forward to coming back next trip."}
{"text":"Free wine and beer now for the price to get in.....but don't expect anything that tastes good....I had the red wine....sad Cab.  I wanted to go back as I remember this being a good buffet.  I went to the buffet and the ARIA the day before.  Don't kid yourself the ARIA is WAY better than this.  This is a very average Vegas buffet.  To give you a little perspective....at the Mirage they have 1 Vanilla Gelato and 1 Chocolate Gelato.  Then 3 Sorbets....At the ARIA they have over 12 Gelato's of great quality.  Even simple things like macaroons are way better at the ARIA.  If you can afford to pay the $8 more run to the ARIA.  You will be able to fill up here but it will all be very average food."}
{"text":"It was \"okay\" for the price and the only redeeming factor about this buffet was the carving station having au jus sauce and unlimited alcohol. Other than that, I felt like it should've been better, like 3x better than a $9 buffet.

When I was there Thursday night (June 28, 2018), there was a loud buzzy / alarm-ish sound coming from the ceiling above the cash register area. Not even the large-round-bellied manager did anything about it after he came out of his office."}
{"text":"We got some discount tickets from the discount ticket seller people to go here for $11.99/person and it was worth every penny. The food is really good, they have lots of variety and, when they said unlimited beer and wine, I did NOT expect Goose Island IPA. REALLY, really good place and pretty unbeatable for the money."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time a few weeks ago.. or supposedly for my first time, and everything was so pretty! It was probably because they had just transitioned from lunch into dinner... Anyway, I was excited. Everything is spaced out very nicely and the food was neatly presented. 

The staff were really nice.. especially for having to deal with 4 drunk girls. The lady who was seating us even asked if one of our girls was going to be okay considering she could barely comprehend what was going on.. haha

However, the food is not all that great. I would've rather gone to the Bellagio. I think that the only thing I really liked was the pizza.. but then again, I was pretty drunk. The crab legs were mediocre. Not bad.. just not something I'd want to spend my money on. The prime rib was disgusting - poorly seasoned and dry. I tried a little bit of everything and it all tasted bland... As for the dessert, I didn't even get to that.. Kind of turned off by it so I had fruit instead."}
{"text":"When it comes to food I give this buffet a 4 star.

They have a wide variety of food, the crab (unlike these other yelp reviews) was delicious not frozen normal hahahah.

The food was all high quality, good prime rib, everything was good, maybe great.

NOW! the reason they gave me a 5 star, cause it was my b-day and the staff (yes buffet staff) and the people inside in the buffet all were singing happy B-day hahahahaha.

How many buffets do you really get that warm, cozy b-day feeling? 


Here at Cravings."}
{"text":"Two important contexts to this review.
First, this is only for the Cravings breakfast, and the Cravings brunch (had both).  I make no claims to the dinner service.
Second, my evaluation is done from a perspective that I am evaluating a buffet.  I don't compare and rate a buffet with fine dining restaurants.

The Mirage breakfast buffet was acceptable, but it would not have been at full price (we were comp'd both times).  The food is typical buffet quality.  Not outstanding and not original.  The options during the breakfast are surprisingly limited.  This is even true at the omelet station where there are a limited number of ingredients.  I walked away full, but felt those who paid full price would have been disappointed.

The brunch has many more options and comes with alcohol, however the price is significantly higher (again, I didn't pay it).

I'd have a hard time justifying the $20 price for the regular breakfast.  If one has transportation, Sunset Station would offer a better buffet at less than half the price.

If you're on the strip and going to pay full price, I think you'd do much better at Cosmo (Wicked Spoon) or Aria.

The one place I felt the buffet might have had a slight edge was in the desserts.  Some very good options there.

If you're comp'd, it's a fine.  If you've got a two-for-one and you're already there, it's okay.  If you're paying full price, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went to the lunch buffet at this place and was surprised to see that the price of the buffet at lunch on the weekend is the same price as a dinner buffet at the Bellagio on a weeknight. It did come with bottomless poor quality momosas, bitter IPS beer, or bottom shelf wine. If it's crap, is it worth anything being bottomless?

The quality of the foods were more miss than hits. I couldn't eat any more because of the food and not because I was too full.

The layout was difficult since it was all on an outside ring with a tight seated middle area. I ran into many people while just trying to get some food. They only let people get food on one side of the carts instead of two sides which also added to the difficulties of the food getting logistics.

The service seemed to be having a bad day and gave off a rude anger so we really didn't want to bother her at all and said polite thank you's to her anytime she did anything. It wasn't a great experience."}
{"text":"After hearing about how good the Mirage buffet is, I finally had the opportunity to give it a go. Price is excellent especially using the Tix4Tonight coupon. The line wasn't very long and we were able to get seated very quick. The biggest disappointment for me is we sat near the entrance of the buffet and were exposed to the casino smoke. My scent of the food was overridden by cigarette smell. I think if I was closer into the restaurant I would've enjoyed it much more. The asian area was very limited, with only 4-5 items in the Japanese section and 4-5 items in the Chinese section. The prime rib was great and went well with the steamed crab legs. Desserts were average at best. A pie I tried tasted very stale. Nice selection of soft drinks at the soda machine; close-by were cappuccino machines and a bar that served 2 selections of draft beer and wine. Overall great quality for the price compared to other buffets on the Strip and I would go back."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing - came November 2014 for brunch, and the main course dishes just did not deliver. Yet, from this, I learned a couple of take-aways:

1. don't come during the weekends - yes, they serve bottomless mimosas, but if you're a weak drinker like me, you'll most probably better off with other buffets. 
2. don't listen to MLife desk - they have no clue on discounts available at the buffets - you can use AAA card for 20% discount on total bill
3. weekday buffet is better, yet if you insist on coming weekends, go to Rodizio  instead (heard great things about them and plan on going there next time)
4. I would rank Cravings after: Caesar's Palace Buffet, Planet Hollywood, Le Village, the Spice Market, and a slew of others - Cravings just was upsetting. 

The service was pretty good, but overall - one just has a higher expectation for the food availability and Cravings was not able to fulfill 1/10th of the expectations - but still, I give them credit for the dessert bar and prime roast."}
{"text":"Some of the food was good so for that reason I am giving it two stars. The food is awkwardly spread out, maybe they want you to have a selection when you travel around the buffet. But there is no way I can tell anyone go to this counter for this or that because it's all over the place, i.e. What would cereal be doing at the salad station? Gravy was rushed so it's gritty from the flour. Now the big problem is we paid extra for the alcoholic drinks(it was only six bucks but that's beside the point). One bartender tries to tell me my Bloody Mary already has vodka in the premix sorry but that is bull you just gave me tomato juice. The other bartender was great one of the first things he does is pour the vodka in. So let's just say I wouldn't recommend this buffet nor would I ever come back. By the way desert station is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Overall, a decent buffet.  Nothing really stood out as spectacular and a nice bonus is the inclusion of draft beer and wine."}
{"text":"I had read mix reviews about this buffet and was a little skeptical at even going but I thought we would give it a shot. Why not its Vegas right and it is about gambling after all right? Was I shocked at the quality and the variety of what they had to offer. Of course I was most impressed with the dessert bar as they had so much to offer. Smaller portions so you could sample more. The coconut macaroons were a huge hit for me as I am a huge fan to begin with. Their layout is a little different than some so make sure you take a trip around their world before you start eating I think you will be surprised."}
{"text":"Been to this buffet enough times.  Wide variety of choices, which is nice, but I got food poisoning last visit.  There is nothing else it could have been as that was the only meal for the day.  Got so violently ill I was unable to travel!

Yes, great selection, but prepare yourself just in case you pick something tainted."}
{"text":"We went to this buffet for brunch.  It wasn't as spectacular nor over-the-top as Carnival, but I think the food quality was higher.  It also has bottomless mimosas, which is great for all the alcoholics in the world."}
{"text":"We just got back from Las Vegas. We ate several places; Wynn, Bellagio, & Paris.  We all agree that breakfast at Cravings gets the only 5 star.  The breakfast entrees and desserts were the most delicious. Much better than breakfast at Tableau. 
You cannot beat the price and quality. AAA members actually get 20% off the check. That's unbelievable. I've been an AAA member for years and never saw an actual discount until now.

Also...  beer and wine is included in the price of the breakfast buffet. No additional charge.  The coffee is really good here."}
{"text":"The food is cold and is something similar to cafeteria food but for my military folks they have 50% off for the Buffett. 

Pros: 50% Military discount
          Unlimited Wine and Beer Included

Cons: Food is not great

Overall with the discount my mom and I ate and drank for $32~  total. Probably cheaper than we could have done at the sandwhich shop here. Without the discount though I would not recommend Cravings Buffett at the Mirage."}
{"text":"Located in The Mirage and unlimited alcohol! 

1. Came here for a group dinner and only had 1 plate of food and 1 dessert. I really wish I had more time to sample everything.
2. There are stations lined up against the wall and are split up by region (?).
3. Avoid the sushi. Each piece is 90% a lump of soggy rice.
4. Try the tamales! This was one of my favorites.
5. The mac & cheese was really good too. You can never go wrong with staples."}
{"text":"Just got back from Vegas...again.

Decided to try Cravings at the Mirage since we were staying there.  We booked through Expedia and they offered 2 free buffets with the stay so we went for brunch on Sunday morning.  Brunch on Sat-Sun come with unlimited mimosas so that was the way to start the morning off!

First thing is first...no waiting lines at all!  Everyone packs out the Bacchanal, Wicked Spoon, and other buffets.  So, this was a big plus!

Onto the food...  Wow!  I would have paid the $30 bucks for this!  I'm not a huge fan of buffets and I've tried most here in Vegas, and this was right there at the top.

It didn't have quite the selection as a Bacchanal, but what was there was just as tasty.  They had omelets made to order, a large breakfast selection including really good eggs benedict, a really tasty Mexican section, cold crab legs, loads of boiled shrimp, an Asian section, sushi section, cold cuts/charcuterie section, and a really nice dessert selection.

Servers were great and kept the plates off the table and the mimosa and coffee cups full at all times.

I was pleasantly surprised with Cravings and everyone with me said it was just as good as Bacchanal, which is quite the complement."}
{"text":"Great buffet.  We bought coupons at tix4tonight 2$ a piece. and got half off so only paid 11.99 a piece lunch price but went at 2:30 so we got dinner at 3.  Prime rib, crab legs was great!  The asian food was really good too.  Everything we tried was good but we could not try it all way too much food.  Unlimited beer and wine but I just had the sodas which all regular drinks were self serve.  We really enjoyed this buffet and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"First thing to mention is that wines and beers are included and this earns the 5* for this buffet, but do remember that liquors are not included.
The other thing is that the smoked ham and the dessert with the red stuff on the surface are extremely delicious."}
{"text":"Solid buffet. As my usual at a buffet, I was looking for prime rib and shrimp and got both. Crab legs were a great bonus. The sushi rolls were \"meh.\" Lots of good choices and I never got anything that did not taste good. Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Nice place, good food, but pricy. They also have beer, and wine on the house!!!!! Self served soft drinks, the fancy cola machines! :) service was good and staff is friendly! Try to make the lunch buffet bc it's cheaper!"}
{"text":"Good service and a nice atmosphere.  Food had a few misses.  I really like the drink station instead of asking for wait service for refills.  Sushi was awesome once time and decent the second time I recently visited.  Service is friendly, which is always welcome and sometimes surprising nowadays."}
{"text":"Great buffet for the price and value.  Unlimited mimosas for Sat. and Sun brunch.  8 am - 3 pm.  Good selection of food.  The desserts were alright.  I liked the prime rib, eggs benedict, mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"I want to give this five stars but I can't. We stepped into this place at 3pm on a Monday, so that may have something to do with the quality of the food. Regardless, if you're supplying Vegas tourists with a buffet, it should always be good, no matter what the time. 

Honestly, I only went here because we were already at the Mirage and I wanted a salad bar salad. I was NOT dissapointed with the salad bar, but I was with the fact that some lady tosses it together for you. She put a paltry amount of lettuce in the bowl but topped it with waaaay too many toppings and too much dressing. I had to ask her to add more lettuce. Good thing I did because even with the extra lettuce there was still too much everything else. Sheesh. 

The eggplant parmesan and the pesto pasta were surprisingly good. As good as I have made at home. The cab legs were scary and gross. I put it on my mans plate when he wasn't looking. 

The rest of the buffet left something to be desired. Too bad. For nearly $40 for the both of us I was hoping for more. Would I eat here again? Maybe, but I'd only go around the busy times to guarantee a fresher selection of food. 

And except for the gelato, the desserts did suck. But they have a nice antipasta bar."}
{"text":"Went for Champagne Brunch with a 2-4-1 coupon, they charge extra if you want the Champagne, that sucks. With the coupon great deal, would be mad if I had paid full price.

Selection is great, the taste not so much, I think its not good enough for The Mirage, it def. has gone downhill... put some effort you guys!!!

A solid \"OK\""}
{"text":"Ate at Cravings on my last trip to Vegas.   I have been to Cravings before, but this time was a bitter disappointment.  You go through the normal buffet queue to arrive at your table and I found that everything had changed since my last visit.  They had waiters/waitresses serving tables, but they have basically been reduced to bus persons.  You have to fetch your own coffee, orange juice or alcoholic beverages.  The food was generally acceptable, but no where near where you'd go out of your way to eat there.  Mirage used to have an outstanding buffet, but I would only eat there now if I was staying at the Mirage and frankly you'd be better off going to Bellagio."}
{"text":"Big fan of this buffet. Great selection of food and always wonderful service"}
{"text":"Not that great. 3 adults and 2 kids for $160 you would expect a lot. Maybe that's what it was... I expected too much. Lots of options but not everything tasted good. Very disappointed in the sushi. The rice was very sticky and not great. Only thing I enjoyed was the crab.... lots of deserts to choose from but nothing that looked good. Really dissapointed."}
{"text":"It is not anything special, but at least everything is fresh.  We had dinner around 5pm before a show, and there was no wait! The waitor is attentive, and the bread pudding is the best I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"the buffet was ok.  i dont think there's too many options.  i used a coupon for 2 for $40 with beer and wine.  the food was just average."}
{"text":"I thought everything was nasty here besides for the carved meat. Some of the stuff you don't even want to go near it if you saw it. The asian food was the worst, talk about disgusting, I didn't have any or go there for it, but just looking at it gave me the creeps. The desert wasn't any better either, the gelato tasted ewww. I only came here after seeing the crazy line at the Wynn. Next time I will wait in that crazy line."}
{"text":"Meh!  Had the brunch and the limited food selection in each station is underwhelming.  Quality is par at best.  No impressive when vegas.com put it I. Their 10 ten :/"}
{"text":"This was the worst buffet I have ever eaten at. It lacks variety for lunch, and it tasted cheap.  Lower the price if you're gonna serve food like this please. The price is comparable to Aria or wynn buffet but lacks the quality and flavor."}
{"text":"You know what this place reminds me of? A college dining hall. Actually, most buffets remind me of a dining hall but this one in particular because of the stations, layout, and dishes.

Extremely popular during the Christmas holiday season, we waited about 30-40 mins in line for holiday brunch (11 AM - 3 PM). Got discounted tickets thanks to tix4tonight (30% discount!) and paid about $17/person. 

Highlights include: wonton soup (extremely popular and therefore frequently empty, seafood soup, and...that's it? Of course you have the prime steak, omelet station, variety of sushi, lox, 20+ desserts, but nothing particularly stood out.

Originally, I wanted to give it 2 stars, but really thinking about it, it wasn't like anything tasted bad... (although the macadamia and choco chip cookies were extremely meh). Friendly service and I'm actually a fan of the self-serving drink station. For the wonton soup that my dad loved and the seafood soup that my mom loved, I'll give this dining hall three stars."}
{"text":"The food here is ok. I came here for brunch and surprisingly it was pretty empty on a Sunday morning. The selection was ok and the food was fine but nothing that really stood out. You have unlimited wine and bud light which was cool. I liked the dessert section the most because they had a variety of doughnuts which I never see in a buffet. Not a bad place at all but nothing really amazing."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time.  This was comp so I didn't spend any money... The service? The lady that rang us up was too busy talking to someone else and only half was hearing what were were saying. When we walked in no one was there and I had to ask if we could sit anywhere \"oh no!\" This lady said. Forget about our waitress who did not smile but asked us \" what you want to drink?\" I'm not kidding here. 
The food.. It was a lunch and still breakfast being served buffet. I thought the Chinese food looked good. I grabbed some noodles, asian chicken salad, pot stickers. It was bad! After a few bites I gave up and had a salad ( did someone really need to toss it for me?) I also had some crackers, cheese and champagne. That was my dinner. The dessert was good but hardly enough for a meal conclusion. 
Save your money people. I will not be back! I even have one more comp to use for this Buffett and I will not be using it!"}
{"text":"I am very impressed about this buffet.

I first like it how it's in Mirage. I have always wanted to eat at this hotel but I was not so sure about their restaurants. However, coming to Cravings made me have no regrets about buffets. 

First off, the interior is extremely nice. You are greeted to a wide space where there are two cashiers, one in front of the other, and there you will pay for your meal. The hosts are nice as well. I like how there are more than one hostess in this buffet because they are able to organize where to sit the customers, so it won't be such a big mess when there are many parties waiting for their seat. 

The inside of the buffet is wonderful. It has a clean, functional, modern look to it and there are signs of what stations they provide. They provide typical sections such as Chinese, Italian, BBQ, and more. What was really interesting was their salad bar. Someone actually prepares the salad for you the way that you want! I thought that was nice. 

The food is pretty okay. The crab legs are a bit salty but it's enough to satisfy those seafood lovers. Their jumbo shrimp really gets the brownie points here. They're big and they're not pilled up, like how they do it at other buffets. They put out enough shrimp for you to get enough on your plate. Plus, they offer other ways of eating shrimp. Their food was not dry and I appreciate that a lot. They make sure their foods are fresh and ready to serve. Even their pizza wasn't as hard as cardboard. It tasted fresh! Their prime rib was excellent and even their Chinese food was easy to manage for someone, like me, who can't stand Chinese food as much as they want to. They have a variety of options in each section so you'll  be able to get enough food for the price you pay. One thing that bothered me as a Korean was that they put Kimchi in the Chinese section. Kimchi is an authentic Korean side dish, not Chinese. I hope they make this correction fast. 

Their plating is absolutely AMAZING! I love how they care about every aspect of the buffet from the interior of the restaurant to the plates and silverware they use. The pictures the other Yelpers provide definitely give you a great idea of how the restaurant is and what to expect. It shows that they value their customers and want everyone to feel that they are eating the best of the best in Las Vegas. 

Overall, I am a huge fan of this place. I have been to many buffets in Las Vegas and I cannot be any happier about choosing this buffet. You can come here before seeing a show or with your friends before a long night of partying with your friends at the hottest club in Vegas. If there are children part of the party,  come by for their desserts. There are a wide variety of choices from ice cream to cookies and cakes everyone can enjoy. For the parents, a nice sip of coffee will do just right after a delicious meal from many cultures. This is one good stop to go to and there won't be any regrets choosing a buffet instead of a restaurant. There is a reason why this buffet is called \"Cravings\": everything that you are craving for, you can get it here! :) 

Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Our first Vegas buffet was a big disappointment.  The food did not have much flavor and what they did have had been sitting out for a very long time.  I am an average consumer, no big bank roll, so for $35 a person I was expecting at least fresh.  If I liked crab legs I may have gotten more for my money, but they too had been sitting there a long time and I was not even tempted to try them."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of buffets so I was surprised how much I loved this one! Beer & wine are included in the buffet price; liquor costs extra. Cravings is inside the Mirage...which is a really nice hotel to walk through. I recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised that majority of the ratings are 4 stars. My guesses are depending on your palate of what you like to eat rather than quality etc. Next is depending on the day you go they may serve better things, lets say the weekend. I came here on a weekday for dinner and i didn't each much because nothing seems good to me. I go to Vegas quite often and pretty much tried 90% of all the buffets in Vegas. Not embarrassed to say, people don't call me a buffet queen for nothing you know. So I am comparing them to each other. Here is a few things in a nutshell:

The Chimichurri sauce was extremely spicy without warning. Although I guess its my fault for not catching all the chilli flakes that were in there but it would have been a nice courtesy to put that on a menu card. (minus-1/2 star) The biscuits were hard and cold as if it may injure someone if I threw it across the room. I even questioned if it was suppose to be for display only and I grabbed it by accident since they were cold. (minus-1/2 star) The presentations of the food were ok not great. For a place that big, I would have thought there were a lot of varieties but there wasn't. The seafood are not as fresh as many other buffets I have had in Vegas. The desserts were good but again not great. They had macarons which I love but they were thrown all over the place on a dish. Some fell off to the table and some were pretty broken up pieces that shouldn't be placed there anymore. (minus 1-star)

In a way, I kind of like how we can grab our own drinks at the beverage bar yet I also see it as part of a service. So you can be the judge of what floats your boat. The service was great though as the server looked at my receipt while I was getting my food first and when I returned he greeted us my our last names. Very professional. They were friendly and grabs my old plates away pretty quickly. There were ice cream but the person that scoops it was not there. I stood there for almost 5 minutes before she came out from the kitchen. First time this ever happened in Vegas. Don't they have coverage should she need to walk away for a minute?

Cost: for about $30/dinner, I have had much better and more variety of selections.  I understand maybe its because the beer and wine are unlimited but think the customer should have a choice to opt out and not pay for that portion if they don't want to drink any alcohol there. (minus-1 star)

So overall, this place is descent but seriously for the price you pay, I wouldn't eat there again as I had much better elsewhere for a fraction of the cost. See my other reviews for more reviews on other buffets."}
{"text":"All you can drink Beer and wine included with the price of the buffet. Go to tix4tonight first to get 50% off and its the cheapest place to get drunk on the strip."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  I've had much better in Reno.  The prime rib was tough, the seafood was nothing special  and the desserts were horrible.  Save your money and go to the Buffet at the Bellagio or the Wynn.  Or just walk a few steps and head over to Carnegie Deli.  Don't waste your calories here."}
{"text":"We got a half price deal on the strip so we decided to go. Everything I tried was good, especially the sushi and crab legs. The crab legs were cut down the middle so you don't have to crack them which is great. The beer and wine were cheap options but it's all you can drink so I guess that's why. I really liked the creme brule for dessert, yummy!"}
{"text":"We had the lunch buffet and the breakfast buffet. The lunch was ok. There were lots of options. The sushi was actually really good! The breakfast wasn't great. There's not a lot of breakfast options and the biscuits were hard. The price they charge definitely wasn't worth it to me."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of buffets because I feel like I never get my money's worth. I don't eat a lot in one sitting, but I eat very often. Despite this (and a fierce hangover), I still managed to drag my butt out of bed to have brunch with my friends and I hella do not regret it. 

Brunch with unlimited bloody marys? HOLLER!
Brunch where there's an older Asian lady who can be my momma making pho and wonton noodle soup? HOLLER!

Although I did not eat $23.95 worth of food, it was a great experience. Reminiscing with friends about the details from the night before was priceless. HOLLER!"}
{"text":"My favorite buffet in Vegas!  

My family likes breakfast foods and I don't, so we got here at 10:45 to get the best of both worlds (for $15).  This buffet has a huge selection and soft ambiance.  Here's what I loved about this place:

1.  Great service- servers picked up plates and refilled drinks ASAP
2.  Pita bread with baba ghanoush
3.  Sweet potato and corn salad
4.  Hand cut prime rib
5. Coffee gelato
6.  Made to order noodle soup
7.  Chicken tacos with all the fixings + tortilla chips
8.  Kung pao beef

FYI:  My server told us that you can add a whole lobster with your meal for an additional $10."}
{"text":"First off, I only went here because my mom did a museum tour and the locals that gave the tour said this place was the best buffet for the price.  When I went with my wife and parents, we were amazingly surprised.
First, I am active duty military and my dad is retired military.  When we went to pay before entering, we found out its about 50% off for military.  That took the ~$75 bill per person and made it much more favorable.
Second, it was unlimited wine and beer, they had Draft Beer (some type of micro-brew I don't really drink beer) and Moscato (sweet white wine that my wife and mom love) - so it was pretty awesome.  
Third, the food was amazing diverse.  Usually the seafood is old stale crab legs or some small amount of good stuff... This place had tons of fresh shrimp, crab legs, oysters, and a seafood soup that was pretty bomb.  They had both well done and medium rare prime rib, turkey, and the normal sides for a carving station.  Chinese section with your normal selections with all fresh vegetabls which was pretty amazing.  An Italian section, with a create your own pasta bar thing - which was pretty entertaining.  They also had a Japanese/Sushi area which although not the best, worked out.
The deserts were plentiful and they had crème Brule (however you spell it) which both my wife and mother love.
The fact they are military friendly, have a diverse selection, and everything is fresh makes this place a great choice to go to if you ever have the chance.  I will definitely go again next time I go here."}
{"text":"Received two free buffets for stay with the Monte Carlo, and thought we try this buffet from all of the options, I checked Yelp first and this place had the highest rating.  True to form, the selection was good it had a little bit of everything.. but with the little selection this place offers, it was very good.. if you feel like having meat, forget the prime rib and head over to the Italian area, they have grilled steak there that will blow your mind, it was tender and melt in your mouth, the lobster ravioli was excellent as well as the ceviche shots, I just went for the jumbo shrimp.. deserts were awesome as well, I've been to a lot of Buffets and this is one of the better ones!"}
{"text":"This was a meal of convenience as both the wife and I were pretty tired and did not want to leave the hotel.   Food was pretty good for a buffet.   Liked the crab legs the best.  Beer and wine included which was nice.  I was pretty disappointed in the sushi selection but there were plenty of other options."}
{"text":"This was perhaps the worst buffet I've ever had. The food was not refreshed. The service was fair but definitely not interested in doing much. However, for the price of $40, I wouldn't care either since I'm sure they must be making more than minimum wage. I should note that the cost includes wine and beer. Tried the Moscato and it was HORRIBLE. Never again will I set foot in this place."}
{"text":"Highlights:
- Reasonably priced
- Prime Rib
- Crab legs
- Shrimp cocktail

Lowlights:
- Limited variety of dessert"}
{"text":"This is not gourmet food, this is the Mirage Buffet and it's about stuffing your face in the shortest amount of time and being able to make it back to your room in time for a nap before you collapse.

I came very hungry and came out very happy."}
{"text":"We haven't eaten here in a couple years and have to say the quality has gone down.

First off yes its all you can eat but imo for the price it should be much better. The crab legs were nothing but empty shells i found not 1 leg worth putting on my plate. Too many items looked dried out, unappetizing. 

The salads used to be fantastic, there was a lady who would ask what you wanted and prepare it for you. Now the salad area is meh.

If you desire carbonated beverages, beer or wine then this buffet is ok. 

The buffets at Green Valley Ranch or Red Rock are so much better and half the price.

For what was offered when we dined on a early Sunday evening, No i cannot recommend this buffet."}
{"text":"OMG, this place was super good!  The TVs in the queue showing slow motion fruits and veggies being thrown into the air were a little weird, but that was the only downside.  The price of the buffet included beer and wine and they had MOSCATO!!!  I definitely would have gone here again if I had been for another day.  Even better than Bacchanal, and much less expensive."}
{"text":"Price for Lunch: $25.99 ?
Lunch buffet does not come with any seafood!
Which made us sad because we were hoping for some crab legs or oysters, but had none.
The only seafood they had for lunch was sushi and shrimp dipped in marinara.

But good news is that it does come with unlimited selections of beer and wine.
Although I was too full and hungover to have any unfortunately.

Service:
Service was on point. The servers always made sure our old plates were taken away.

Drinks:
All drinks are self serve. They have multiple soda machines, and other options for you to choose from.

Food:
I can honestly say that most of the food here was pretty good.
Not BAD for the price, but not amazing either.
Pretty basic selections. Sushi, salad bar, rotisserie meat, build your own, soups, pizza, etc.
Dessert bar had a lot of selections, nothing too spectacular either, but edible.

Overall, its not a bad buffet if you don't want to spend that much at other casinos."}
{"text":"For the price, this place is ridiculous. You have to get your own drinks which are at opposite ends of the room, then have to walk thru a maze of tables to get to the drink station. Crab legs were all over the floor. I mentioned this to a couple of employees and in our time there it was never picked up. Way to go cravings, leave stuff on the ground for your guests to slip on! One chair we had at our table was wobbly and broken. The  desserts tasted \"odd\"  and not fresh. So we see a chef walking around who says he is the chef of that room, think his name was something like Endeer, and tells us that the buffet staff does not make the pastries, that they order from an outside company. So, does this mean all the big name casinos can't afford a pastry staff, they have to order? Wow, I can only assume then that nothing is made in house, yet they charge an extreme amount of money. Never again. I'm sure there are better buffets for a better price, like at Red Rock casino who by the way never has food on the floor."}
{"text":"I came here at least 3 to 4 times already as we eat at different buffet restaurant every trip to Vegas and always think this is a good place to eat but this restaurant is so down rate since our last time here around New Year 2008. This buffet restaurant had bad service and bad food we did not expect to be at 4 star hotel. We came there the day before Thank Giving 2012 for Dinner with a group of 4 adults and 3 kids. Price is expensive $30/adult and $23/kid but it failed our expectation for the price we paid. The king crab legs were supper dooper salty, I meant very very very salty (they intended so you can't eat)! These crab legs also had the smell of spoil food and the crab meat ( you could see since they precut in half) turned yellowish/ brownish color. I think that why they dumped in more salt in to reserve the food or to masked the taste of bad food. Their meat dumplings (dim sum) filled with undercooked meat clearly visible supper red meat inside and smell bad. I urged to throw up after a bite of it right at the table. After that, I asked to talk to a manager, manager never came and later was told by our Waiter he will tell the manager himself and will talk to the guy who in charge of the dumplings and suggest I get different food. I couldn't pick anything else except for the salad bar and bread that look fresh. Their boiled shrimps on ice smell bad and taste like you eating bad white rice. Their foods and soups are all salty. If you want foods like these you don't have to go to a restaurant and pay that much. You can play with a 5 year old to mix all the ingredients in and it might turn out better. It also take us so long to get our drinks and when we ask for refills, the waiter busy and when we reminded the other waiters who was walking around and another one cleaning up our next table, they said I had to ask the waiter who serve our table. Then our waiter came back after 10-15 minutes. We needed the drink to saturated their salty food but need to wait that long ? I will never ever come back there again. If there is a zero star I would give them a zero. Please don't waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"We ventured over here for dinner one evening as we had family with us and children who wanted to see the volcano, Tigers, etc...

I must say the selection and food overall was great. With the somewhat steep price of $35 per person did it come with 2 different beers to choose from and the house wine as well.

My wife really loving crab legs enjoyed the buffet. So one of the better buffets we have been to and would definitely make a return trip next time in Vegas when were in the mood for a buffet."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of buffet. I find them kind of gross normally. Cravings was pretty good with a very large selection of food. We went for brunch, so all you can eat plus unlimited champagne or mimosas for $25 is pretty damn good. Our waitress was very attentive and accommodating. 

I would have given this place 3 stars if it hadn't been for the hostesses / cashiers at the front. We were a group of 12, but were just going to meet inside. Paid for our meals, went to be seated, and asked for a large table since we were a group. Mind you the place was empty given it was around 11am .... told no flat out. Then told we would have to pay extra for a group ... aren't you a buffet in a casino? And shouldn't you cater to groups? We noticed they were giving an elderly group of people the same treatment. Luckily our waitress just moved us and we were all able to sit together. Personally, I don't care about the extra $3 or $5 bucks, it was just the attitude of the hostess was completely out of line."}
{"text":"My friends and I paid $30 for the buffet with unlimited champagne. It was delicious! My friends drank so much champagne, they were buzzed all night long. We also stayed there and ate/chatted for 3.5 hours. The drink service was great. The food was also delicious. I literally liked everything I put on my plate. The diversity of food here made me ecstatic and it's all good quality. I wish I could go back asap!"}
{"text":"One of the better buffets I've been to.  The price is pretty out there, but there's definitely variety if that's what you're looking for. 

The place is pretty much square shaped and there's food choices surrounding each side the cube.  The place is really bright and there's plenty of seating.

I never feel like it's actually worth 25-30 bucks to eat at a buffet as the quality of the food isn't as high as some restaurants, but at the the same time the quantities are insane and unlimited.  Most of the time I find myself eating a plate or sometimes two and maybe a bit of dessert. 

I don't eat as much as some people because it's kind of disgusting.  People eating the way they do sometimes at buffets is enough to lose your appetite, so it might be a good idea to not look around so much. 

If you're a big eater definitely come here, if not, a restaurant which serves a decent portion might do the trick for ya."}
{"text":"This is a fairly good buffet.  We stopped by hear because we heard they had king crab. They do not.  What they have is snow crab with a king crab label on it.  Trust me, I'm Alaskan.
Other than that, service was fine. The food was good, but not phenomenal.  Everything was brightly lit and looked clean.  I would definitly come here again, but now will not have my heart lit up looking forward to those yummy king crab legs. 
Also, we had an issue with our wheelchair for one of the parental units.  The hotel staff were very helpful and retrieved an ice pack for the injury in record time."}
{"text":"It was a Saturday, and the line was between 15-20 minutes long, just to get to the cashier, ($25 per person) and then another 5 to 10 minutes while they scrambled to make room available.  All that waiting had me thinking that there was some seriously good food to be had.  Alas, that was not the case.  The food was terrible.  The oranges were sour.  The melon was tasteless.  The waffles were hardened and the seafood was obviously frozen for too long or something.  Bad bad bad.  I was hoping to drown my sorrows in the champagne but the waitress took so long I was only able to get two of them at all.  The only good thing in the place was the freshly made omelettes.  But seriously, the buffet at Terrible's Hotel & Casino was way better for half the price.  And that's not even a good one either."}
{"text":"Great variety, but lobster would be nice. Sushi, the usual delicious carving station, Asian goodies, pastas, pizzas, etc. The WINNER hands down is the cioppino which is so flavorful and spicy... Similar to a 7 Mares. Incredibly memorable. Dinner comes with all you can drink beer and wine(white/red... Not fine wine but fine by me). Hot and cold crablegs, awesome pesto, and wonderful ceviche. Enjoy IPA(included) with ceviche."}
{"text":"There were four of us dining at Cravings Buffet at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas. After reading the Yelp reviews with a \"Yelp sort\", we knew we could not go wrong at Cravings.  Yelp sort is interesting.  You always seem to find higher rated reviews on top, which is the first thing a viewer sees, so when a reviewer writes that Cravings Buffet is one of the best on the strip, you can't help but put faith in the review.  Wrong thing to do.  Sort by the most recent reviews and read everything for the past few weeks. 

We arrived at Cravings Buffet and were greeted with smiles from the cashier to the hostess to employees on the floor.  Eleven food stations were filled with fresh, perfectly seasoned and delicious foods to tantalize even the most sophisticated palate. From Asian to Italian, each station duplicated authentic ethnic cooking.

The second paragraph written above is more of a fantasy and not reality.  Our experience was the exact opposite.  I have given Cravings a one-star because that is the lowest Yelp allows.  Had there been an opportunity to give a negative 1,2,3, etc, it would have been rated the absolute lowest and for good reason.  

The old saying, \"you get what you pay for\" does not apply when dining at Cravings Buffet in the beautiful Mirage Hotel, Las Vegas.  The buffet is one of the more expensive on the Las Vegas Strip, so anyone reading the Yelp reviews and other expect at least good food, if not exceptional.

We arrived at Cravings just a few minutes after 3 PM when the dinner menu began.  Prices increase considerably if you arrive at 3 PM instead of 2:58 PM or 2:59 PM.  That is the difference between their Friday brunch and Friday dinner.

First impressions are lasting ones and the cashier was not too friendly, though not nearly as rude as the seating hostess. Okay, so you only deal with those two for a few minutes before moving onto more disappointment. My husband went straight to the seafood station, while I headed for the Asian cuisine.  His crab legs and mussels were terribly overcooked and had no seasoning.  He drank one of their cheap beers from the bar before trying the crappy red and white wines.  Veronica was working the floor when she came to the table to ask if everything was okay.  My husband told her the crab legs were rubbery and she said that is the way crab is prepared at Cravings.  I grabbed some rice, chow mein, Asian dumplings, sushi, and a few other things to sample.  Of course nothing tasted good.  Everything was mushy and bland.  Sad, sad, sad.

A few tips to Cravings Buffet management at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas:

1) Train or retrain your staff in customer service.  When employees are rude to customers, they will likely not return.

2) You have a serious issue with food quality.  If your chefs are preparing the food according to the recipes, then change the recipes and purchase better quality ingredients.  If not, hire chefs with formal training.  That applies to your pastry chefs as well.  Your desserts are not worth eating.

3) Train your serving staff, especially at the carving section.  First they should be knowledgeable about the products they are attempting to carve.  The carver should know the type of cut and the difference in temperatures.  When a customer requests medium rare, and the options are medium rare or well-done, it should be served as ordered.  If your  procedures are to have both temperatures available and they are not prepared properly, then your chefs should have caught the error and corrected.  Second, when someone asks to have meat cut thin, that does not mean 3/4\" or more.  Their carving knives appeared to be capable of carving properly.

4) Even when customers have a horrible experience, a good floor manager can make things better if they tried.  Again, that wasn't the case with us.  One of the other diners in our group requested the manager come to the table.  An older frumpy woman came, along with an assistant chef to hear some of the issues.  She explained to both that the food was grossly over-cooked and was terribly bland.  Salt and pepper is cheap, so why not use to help make your food taste better.  It was one of her birthday meals and she ended up spitting out 
everything she put into her mouth.  She told the manager it was some of the most disgusting food ever attempted to eat and was truly disappointed with the experience.  

While three of the four at the table expressed to your personnel that the food was crappy, the only thing done was the manager refunded money for one person.  A good manager at a reputable restaurant would have refunded the entire amount, apologized for our unfortunate experience at Cravings Buffet, then ask us to return one day after they improve on their shortcomings and nothing less.  

You totally failed with food, customer service and value for price paid.  Shameful."}
{"text":"Crab claws, prime rib, shrimp, tasty soups, this buffet has it all. It has to be impossible to go here and not find more than a few things you'll love.

My only minor complaint was the lighting. Super bright lights bring me back to my cafeteria days. I don't want to be reminded of elementary school cafeterias while having duck or lobster. It just isn't quite right. 

Other than that, I would certainly recommend this place especially if you're traveling with a group of picky eaters or have a few who are indecisive. Problem solved. Something for everyone."}
{"text":"PERFECT!! Thanks to the expert research and planning of Grace L., this was the one stop of our entire Bachelorette weekend that everyone agreed was bomb. Although we stopped in for the brunch buffet, the entire place was loaded with pretty much everything you would expect for a dinner buffet - all for ~$20!! (More for bottomless mimosas or bloody marys). 

Even better, although there are tons of ridiculously good foods for you to load up on (ex. king crab, shrimp cocktails, prime rib), they still have noodle soup, congee, fruit and tea, my standard and required hangover foods. Also, a very nicely stocked section of your standard breakfast items (I saw Jennifer S. wandering around on the first round with an empty plate filled only with bacon!!) Niiiice!

If you are planning a Vegas trip for a big group of people I would strongly advise that you stop by here for brunch. Happy campers = separate checks + unlimited variety. Priceless!!"}
{"text":"Not worth the money. Crab legs very small and salty.  Chinese section looked like food was laying for a few days."}
{"text":"food CRAVINGS.

As with our visit to the Pantry, my mom and I visited the Cravings Buffet for dinner purely out of convenience (there was a line at the Pantry).  The Cravings Buffet is located at the Mirage Resort on the casino level near Portofino and Stack.

1.  Yes, they serve dinner!  Till 900pm.  Adult dinner pricing is $28.99.

2.  Yes, unlimited wine and beer (limited selection) are included in the dinner price.  Cheers everyone!

3.  Yes, you must now get your own drinks (we discovered that this must be a new process when we visited the Bellagio buffet the following day for lunch and found the exact same drink dispensers).  Customers may help themselves to soda, juice, and water from the multiple dispensing machines available (cups are on the side).  Visit your friendly bartender for the adult beverages at the bar in the rear.  

4.  Yes, the server was friendly and nice.  She brought over extra napkins, and hand wipes for our use during dinner.  She also offered to bring any other sauces or condiments as needed.

5.  Yes, like any good Vegas buffet, there are various food stations and cuisine.  At Cravings Bufffet, these include Italian, Fish/Seafood, Latin, American, Asian/Sushi, Salad, and Dessert, of course.  I think my favorite was the Italian station....I liked the pizza and pasta.  The most disappointing station (for me and my mom) was the desserts.  We just didn't find anything to our liking really (i.e. no cheesecake).

6.  Yes, seating is plentiful.  Like any Vegas buffet, there is a sea of tables and chairs available.  Thankfully, on the night we dined it wasn't overly crowded.

7.  Yes, its a buffet...eat till you're content, or until you don't have any room left in your stomach.

BOTTOM LINE:
It was a satisfactory visit at the Cravings Buffet.  I liked that the wine and beer was included with the dinner pricing."}
{"text":"We had an amazing time here!! The food was amazing and neatly organized. 

We are a family of four and each left with full belly's. My husband was happy there was Unlimited BEER and I try a glass of the unlimited WINE!! It was a fun and eventful night after a long cheer competition!! 

TIPS: 
I also play a game on you can download in the App Store, it's  called MyVegas. We redeemed a buy one get one free dinner. That was really nice since the buffets in Vegas tend to be a little pricey. 

Thank you Mirage for a dinner!"}
{"text":"I visited this particular buffet like 7 years ago and I couldn't recall if it was better than the others or average...I ate at so many buffets that trip, I couldn't compare one to the next.

I have forever been playing the Vegas slots game on Facebook and scored a buy 1 get one free for breakfast or lunch.  I like to hit up a place like this before heading back home to fill up so that was the plan.  The meal came to about $10 and some change  for breakfast and I was NOT disappointed.  Whoa...not only did this place have every breakfast item available - donuts, oat meal, eggs, hash browns, bacon, etc but there were so many more additions - fruit, cheese and crackers, PIZZA! Chips and Guacamole! AND unlimited beer and wine.... and no, I didn't partake in that but a fab option!

Even without the coupon you could really fill up here to fill you up for breakfast AND lunch so check this option out...such a good deal!"}
{"text":"I was highly disappointed with brunch. We stopped by on Monday 1/8/2018 as our last destination before heading home to SoCal. There were limited breakfast items available for brunch. The icing on the cake however was when I took a bite of a donut and there was a hair imbedded inside. The manager said she could give us her information to contact her the next time we were in town so we could come back to the buffet since she could not comp our meal. We waited about 15 minutes and then never seen her again."}
{"text":"We went for brunch on Easter.  It was barely ok.  Interesting place - lots of variety.  Looked more impressive than it was.

it's kind of a trip around the culinary world.  they have whatever you might want - mexican, asian, italian, etc.   problem is, the food was meh.  Much of it was cold/soggy.  

Service was good, but not a place I would visit again."}
{"text":"We got a 2-for-1 coupon for the buffet from the Convention and Visitor's bureau. Came to the casino, had the cashier and the manager tell us they decided to stop accepting them. Ridiculous. We obviously decided not to patronized the business that would do such a thing. Distribute the coupons to bring people in, then decide to stop accepting them."}
{"text":"immense salle avec de gigantesques buffet de tous les pays , all you can eat pour 26 dollars...super mais pas tres chaleureux"}
{"text":"I'm rating four stars because I used a BOGO comp. Most of food was good, only a few dishes I didn't like. The sushi was very good as well. For the BOGO free price I would go again but I would not pay $60 plus for two people. It's not worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"There is nothing better in Vegas than after a late, late night out sleeping in and having a great brunch.  Hubby and I decided to heck out the Cravings Buffet in the Mirage Hotel and Casino.  We were quickly seated and off to fend for ourselves.  There is a great selection of food mixed with breakfast which too me is the best of both worlds.  They have your standard breakfast items but my favorite is the omelet station which was made perfect.  The pizza is amazing here too, you can tell that the dough is made from scratch and the sauce is perfect not too sweet not too tart.  The best thing I ate here was the soups, I had a seafood bisque that was hands down one of the best I have ever had.  Very rich and creamy but you could still taste the essence of the seafood.  The Cioppino blew me away and they are not skimpy on the seafood either so definitely give this one a try."}
{"text":"We went to this buffet because of the deal with the Cirque de Soleil LOVE. However, if I had a choice, I probably would not go back. Price is relatively reasonable, but the quality and variety of the food isn't as great. They do have it nicely organized by category, but most buffets do that international theme it seems. Dessert was the best part. Plus the free wine we happened to land on."}
{"text":"Weve been to this buffet for sunday brunch almost every single vegas trip we do. But... after our last experience a week ago. Im not sure we will ever return. It only takes one bad employee/ experience to ruin it forever for a place. 
So basically my bad experience was with one of the employees. Those insignificant people that clear your table and take your empty plates. Well apparently this lady thought she was on the fast track to upper management the more people she \"caught\" eating that didn't pay. So with my personal experience, my 3 year old daughter already had previously ate before we got there plus even if she was fully hungry she wouldn't have ate more than a few bites. I didn't feel the need to pay for her \"admission\", and she was caught eating two pieces of bacon. OMG.... OH NOOOOO THE WORLD IS GOING TO END because a 3 year old didnt pay for 2 pieces of bacon. So any way, this lady made the biggest scene it was fu**king embarrassing. But after giving us lip, she just left. So i sat there and i watched this lady like a hawk. Cause now shes on my radar. So i watched her find 3 other tables with ADULTS who didnt pay for one person.  And there she was... to make a huge scene where other diners are staring. So embarrassing.  But she also left them alone without charging them. So why act like some sort of narc? For the adults, thats pretty bad... i agree. But come on. Get off your high horse when  it comes to children who just nibble.  You and i know 1000's upon 1000's of perfectly good food gets thrown out just by this one establishment alone (watch the andrew Zimmerman episode las vegas buffets). And she was having a cow over a child. 
Anyways... end of rant and i probably wont return."}
{"text":"I should have paid a couple more bucks and gone to the Bellagio for the buffet. I know buffets do not have the finest food, but I couldn't find one thing here that tasted okay. I could have found everything here in my kitchen at home. Never coming here again. Just tastes bad and greasy in general."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Vegas buffet, and I was definitely disappointed. 2 stars for the price, and the crab legs alone. Oh and maybe the soda machine, which had quite the variety. Other than that, the options and flavors of the food were just.. Meh. The gelato is served in a soft serve machine, which didn't even really taste like gelato. The desserts were bland, and the food was just your average items, nothing that was AMAZING. Probably won't be back, next time I'll be at Caesars buffet which I have heard so much about."}
{"text":"Can't beat the beer and wine included in the price for $30.00 Buffet. They have a lot of diverse selections of foods but limited items. The items that were there, did have good flavor and the food was not dried out."}
{"text":"Cheaper buffet and they have stations easily labeled by type of food (raw bar, Mexican, Italian, Chinese, etc). Overall I felt the food was subpar compared to other buffets in the Strip hotels but this one is probably a little cheaper. They at least have variety though sadly I found the best things for me were the lobster bisque and the gelato dessert.

2 stars for the average food, decent variety, but ultimately disappointing fare. Maybe the variety here just wasn't for my taste buds.

Gripes about buffets in general:
Buffets are hard to get right in my opinion. The high cost of food just for the variety isn't usually worth it. I'd rather have a hot meal made-to-order, than trying to stuff myself with mediocre lukewarm food."}
{"text":"Still going strong.  

Stopped in here last Sunday for lunch/brunch.  Selection is still good, quality still there and the place is still clean.  For $22.95 it's a deal with all you can drink champagne or mimosas.  

I still straight for the crab legs and shrimps and pass up all that carb noise that fills you up quick.

Enjoy"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch.
Fresh food/great selection/great service/shrimp,oysters,crab.....sushi....TheWorks
Bottomless champagne and incredible desserts, Veronica was a great server."}
{"text":"My family was very happy with the quality and the variety offered at the Mirage Buffet. We went for early dinner on  Monday and it was quite vacant; however, from what I could see the Mirage did not hold back on their offerings. I pricked up discount tickets from tix2night that worked very smoothly. Had sushi, prime rib, BBQ ribs, pork tamale, prepared to order pasta that was excellent,  wine was so-so, but that was not my reason for going. Their deserts were excellent as well. The Creme Brulee and the Mirage Bread Pudding with vanilla sauce were delicious. 

We did return again in a few days latter as the Mirage offered us dome 2 for 1 tickets during our first dinner. This time it was for Lunch and was equally fabulous. The food is very fresh and the staff is very prompt and professional."}
{"text":"Noting much inside, but it's cheap. You can get 2 for 1 brunch from the waitress. If you go there before 3:00, you can have dinner with lunch price!"}
{"text":"First off this place will cost you around 27 after tax for dinner time and the wait time isn't too bad. The price is decent considering sushi buffets back home were around that price after tip. I heard the price varies alot depending on the time and day.

I was told by everyone that this buffet was pretty good but honestly I was kinda disappointed. I honestly expected Vegas food to be top notch, like looking at the food makes me want to drool. You get a variety of food from diff cultures. I would say the spotlight to this place would be the prime rib and the seafood. They have some nice wonton soup but stay away from the chicken noodle. Desserts looked very bland. The gelato ice cream is pretty delicious looking too, they have someone serving it to you. I'd stay away from the sushi.

I didn't really eat that much because I was anticipating barfing later that night but overall I felt this place was just okay... It's good for the price, I guess for the quality I was expecting, I'd need to pay more money."}
{"text":"We went here for free thanks to MyVegas/Mlife. It's probably one of the better \"cheap buffet\" options. \"Cheap\" in price compared to the big names anyways (Bellagio, Caesars, Wynn, etc). Plenty of food options, food seemed to always be fresh, and the desserts were great. If you want ambience / premier service, go to Bellagio or the Wynn, but if you just want endless food for a decent price (or free if you're like us), the Mirage buffet is just fine.

We had no wait for lunch entry at 2:30pm on a Sunday. When we left, during dinner entry (around 3:45) there still wasn't much of a line."}
{"text":"50% military discount and the food is great and place is spotless. I have a special allegiance to businesses that honor military service - big fan, thank you"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for the champagne brunch. It was about $28 which is a lot cheaper than the nicer Vegas buffets. And you don't have to wait in a super long 1-hour line which is a plus!

I was actually pleasantly surprised by this buffet! I really didn't expect much because it's in the Mirage hotel and I'd never really heard of it but they actually have a huge variety. Quality isn't all there for some of the food items, but there is a HUGE variety of eclectic food. And I love how every section is neatly labeled (ex. \"chinese\", \"sushi\", \"mexican\", \"desserts\", \"salad\", etc) so you can go for exactly what you want. 

Some food highlights:

1. The prime rib was surprisingly really good! Red, soft, and juicy. My friend asked if they had cranberry sauce, and they went to the back and brought a huge bowl out for us. So nice of them!

2. They have fried plantains!! Yessss!

3. Crab legs were cracked open in half already like at Bellagio buffet so it's easier to eat but I didn't like the way they tasted. It was pretty much frozen cold and was too salty/fishy for my taste. 

4. The eggs benedict looks really nice, but it was a little too bland in my opinion. 

5. They have sriracha sauce if you need that with your chinese food like I do!

6. They have a gelato bar hidden in the corner next to the desserts! Note: it's NOT self serve. So don't try to go back there by yourself and scoop your own.  Just wait patiently and someone will come to help you. ;)"}
{"text":"I didn't like anything... Expensive rest home food...  Actually the salad bar was ok, that's why they got an extra star.."}
{"text":"I thought that the food was better than the average buffet. Had lots of options, wasn't the best food but wasn't awful. I liked the variety and the free alcohol!"}
{"text":"Ye be warned, it gets crowded at peak times. Large parties like to go there.

Pros: set up is good. Staff is friendly. Plates were cleared quickly. Server even went to find my mom a cracker for her crab. Good options. Dessert was yummy. Lots of tiny portions so you can try a lot. The peach/mango trifle thing is the bees knees. Prime rib was juicy and cooked right. Not fall apart texture, which for a roast it should be, but close. Wine and beer included in fee.

Cons: bathrooms. None! They are outside in the casino. Kid almost peed her pants before we got there. Mind you, the walk is short for an adult. Potatoes had ZERO flavor. That's hard to do. Even just a little salt is ok. Mac n cheese was old and cold. Potatoes wedges were burnt. Steamed rice was old and crunchy. I waited for 10 minutes for someone at the Asian station to replace it, but it was like a ghost town. 

All in all, it's not awful food. But $40 per person is loony toons for what you get. If you aren't eating steak, lobster, or crab, save your pennies."}
{"text":"Got the 2 for 1 deal and this is my husband's favorite place to eat. It was great food and lots to choose from."}
{"text":"Expensive but worth it if you plan on having more than one glass of wine or beer with dinner. Lots of options, many different types of ethnic foods and  American foods (chicken wings and meat carving station)."}
{"text":"I went here a couple days ago as a place to eat after a whole night of drinking and wooziness.  Only 18 dollars for brunch without drinks.  22 with unlimited alcohol--cheaper than bellagio without unlimited alcohol!  Yay.

I took off two stars because I felt that they tried hard in some areas and just didn't think about the others.  The Asian noodle spot was pretty awesome.  They had Vietnamese beef pho they made right in front of you and it wasn't bad (I'm viet and had my share of good/bad pho).  It made me feel all warm and fuzzy.  They also made wonton soup!  At the same spot, they had different kinds of dimsum.  Shrimp balls (awesome) and shumai (not so awesome).  Next to the noodle bar was chicken congee (asian rice soup).  I thought they executed the Asian food quite well!  

On to the other areas.  The seafood spot was okay.  The crab legs were extremely salty for some reason :(   so I didn't eat many of them.  The dessert spot was WEAK.  There wasn't much compared to the Bellagio buffet which has a bajillion pastries.  It was like I was staring at a meager dessert spread at a chinese buffet.  The italian spot only had pizza and the sushi area was okay.  

I believe the key to having a good buffet is people standing there making delicious foods as you walk by like a sushi guru handing you a freshly made spicy tuny roll or a baker stuffing cannolis.  The Mirage buffet lacked such presence (minus the noodle bar).  

But hey!  For the price, the noodle bar, and other various selections, I think it was worth it but I will probably try a different buffet when I'm in Vegas again~~"}
{"text":"This buffet is great!
First of all, you get to serve your own beverages (soda, tea, coffee) AND get unlimited beer/wine at the bar!! 
Second, I liked all the fresh selections of foods they had as well as the variety of foods available. Unlike a few other buffets I have been to in Las Vegas (such as the awful Carnival World Buffet in Rio), this one is certainly one of my favorites."}
{"text":"I am totally a fan of this buffet!! This is te best buffet in Vegas ONLY IF you have it free or at least Buy One Get One Free which can be redeemed with mLife points or myVegas points. I totally enjoyed this buffet for about an hour. We definitely took advantage of the unlimted beer and wine too. It tasted like Sutter Home or Crane Lake wine but I cant complain. The line during Memorial Day weekend was like a 20 minute wait but that's cool bc at least with a buffet once you get seated you start eating vs waiting and then waiting to order, get food made and etc. 
From what I can remember everything on my plate was good. They had the already cracked crab legs and plenty different options. It was nicely setup and our waitress stayed on top of her game! Overall great buffet experience, but nothing spectaular stood out besides the unlimited beer and wine."}
{"text":"This has to be, hands down, the best buffet on the strip!

At breakfast they have a wonderful omelet station. I couldn't get my fill! The guy behind the pan is so sweet and spends time talking to and getting to know each guest!

The prime rib was insanely out of the world good! I was surprised at how much I loved it because I am not a prime rib kind of person. 

I loved how things were in individual servings such as the soy pods. 

They will make you a personalized salad, but if salad is your thing, you have no right entering a buffet. Leave now!

I loved the crab legs, fresh shrimp and so much more. The Latin section was amazing with fresh guac that is heavenly. 

The pizza is ok, nothing to write home about but it is at the Papa John/Dominios level. 

I highly recommend it bc they have a full bar, it is super clean, staff is attentive and friendly and they have tons of food.

Deserts are plentiful and amazing. They have a great sugar-free selection of ice creams and sorbets!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great choice and outstanding service. Money well spent, think even better than Bellagio."}
{"text":"Freaking great!

I was in Vegas over the weekend for a good friend's bachelorette party and after a long and incredibly fun night at XS Lounge at Encore we went to Champagne brunch at Cravings at noon on Saturday.  It was amazing!

Our party of 13 was able to make prior reservations, all pay separately by credit card, and all got to pick and choose whatever we wanted to eat from it's vast selection.

From a continental breakfast, to seafood ceviche, to pho (yes, pho!), to italian, to mexican, etc... there was something for everyone, and with a group of 13, it's everything you could have hoped for.  Not a single person was disappointed in their meal and all for $30 including gratuity and tax.

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to Cravings for dinner on July 12.  I bought a groupon for 2 buffets and unlimited drinks.  Salad tasted very good.  Loved the prosciutto.  Shrimp appetizer was very good as well.  didnt want to take a risk on ceviche because of large amount of liquor going into body later that night.  Tuna sushi was pretty tasty.  Crab legs were just ok.  Prime Rib was very very good.  other sides were pretty tasty as well.  Deserts were ok, but im not a desert guy.  Unlimited beers was a good pre-game to the night as well.  Next time im in Vegas I will be going back"}
{"text":"Mediocre. Definitely not worth $29.99.

The sushi rice was extremely dry and the \"raw bar\" was only shrimp and shrimp ceviche. All you can drink beer and wine turned out to be all you can drink Bud Light.

There are definitely better buffets in Vegas."}
{"text":"Pro: The buffet was delicious. Cheers to the chefs and waiters/waitresses for doing such a good job.

Con: The VA Card that identifies me as combat disabled veteran of the United States Marine Corps was NOT sufficient enough to get a military discount. To the employee at the entrance of Cravings Buffet that questioned my military service: SCREW YOU.

This sort of thing is the reason I won't be doing much business with MGM Resorts in the future. Praise be to God and Semper Fi."}
{"text":"3  stars 

Been to several of the buffets on the vegas strip over the years, got to say the way to get a 5 stars is in my book has to be with the easy items, if you visit any of the buffets here in vegas here is a quick tip for the breakfast or lunch buffets if they can't make scrabbled eggs or mashed potatoes right everything else is going to be less then stellar.

just a tip I picked up from others who frequent the buffets in vegas, for early dinners or late lunches you look for prime rib, if it is dry with no taste your probably at one of the buffets that just throws everything out there with no real prep

here at cravings they did pretty good with there eggs and there mashed potatoes their prime rib was lacking but they made up for it with the choice of shu mai, fresh made not sticky, still dripping due to the steam 

they got alot of choices Italian, Chinese, American, Fishmonger (haha), sushi, several other choices, they also got a bar on this line of options, alcohol you have to pay extra for but im sure you all know that.

there breakfast choices: eggs benedict decent, bacon standard, links standard looked dried up, waffles were perfect crisp outer shell soft chewy inside, french toast not so great, eggs better the most other buffets

for this buffet spot I would go back for brunch price is decent for brunch!

food *** ribs no happy! Eggs, fried rice, shu mai, waffles are crisp outside soft inside
price $$ it is about $28 per person folks
ambiance **** clean, easy to manuver through sections
service ***** very helpful staff"}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty average. We did the all you can drink champagne brunch and that was pretty great. However, I thought the food was pretty bad. The salad was soggy, the eggs were flavorless, everything was sinking in grease, the breakfast burrito was NOT GOOD. Usually, when I'm vegas hungover, anything breakfast appeals to me, so you can imagine my surprise when I left this place hungry. For all of the amazing buffets in Vegas, skip this one."}
{"text":"I really hate buffets - I really really do hate them. I don't know why I even step foot in them - maybe because they are really the only place that offers breakfast super early in Vegas?? The food is never good and I never eat enough for what I am paying for. With that being said - $18 for a western omelet and a glass of water is a little crazy - not the buffets fault - but it still rubs me wrong.

As far as the food is concerned - or should I say the omelet - average nothing to write home about. I didn't even try anything else because it all looked shriveled up...like it was sitting under a heat lamp way to long :-("}
{"text":"I'm on keto diet and this buffet is very good for my breakfast  you can take home/to go for a little less money"}
{"text":"Solid 3.0 rating here. High priced buffet but you do get unlimited beer and wine (Would have been fantastic if I weren't 7 months pregnant!). Mediocre food, good staff. We stopped here for brunch on a Sunday and there was quite a bit of selection, even sushi! The sushi was terrible, like cafeteria sushi, but still, there was a selection. Cheese's from the cheeses bar literally all tasted the same. My husband said he really did enjoy the custom omelet he had made and that the chef really knew what he was doing. The waffles were good, I should have stuck with those. Lots of variety but don't expect to much flavor. Just run of the mill but not terrible."}
{"text":"This place is always my fav. For the $ you can't beat the selection and quality. While the Wynn & Cosmo have higher quality foods this place has the best variety of good tasting food. The Asian food and pizza is the best. The dessert selection isn't great but the gelato is. I'm not a dessert person so I don't mind. If you love dessert Wicked Spoon is the place to be."}
{"text":"I LOVED this buffet. To me it was comparable to The Buffet at The Wynn. They had prime rib, warm snow crab legs, ceviche, sushi, an omelet bar, and a little of everything. Tons of desserts as well!! Define lay coming back next trip to Vegas.."}
{"text":"This was a great buffet with a little bit of everything.  The sushi was fresh, the prime rib is as good as most sit-down restaurants, and they were never out of anything.  We enjoyed the champagne brunch and were given an extra Mimosa before it ended.  

The only things preventing 5 stars was the slow seating process when there are plenty of open tables and the dessert selection left a lot to be desired. 

For $35 per person, it's money well spent."}
{"text":"Decided to try the buffet even though we were a little skeptical due to the ratings. 

Sharon, our server was a joy. She helped us to know what to do in the Mirage and when to see the shows. Always very quick with the Champage refills and any requests. 

The food in the buffet was very well prepared and there are many varieties from which to chose. The omelet station was perfect with hardly any wait and certainly made to order without butter. 

Would definitely return and feel the value is worth what you pay."}
{"text":"holy moly. the worst buffet ever. it was like a bad hometown buffet. my husband had two small plates and decided he didnt want to put his taste buds through any more misery and just start pounding away at their complimentary  beer. everything was cold and extremely salty. i had a bite of the prime rib and i felt like i just put a cube of salt in my mouth -_- at one point they even ran out of clean plates! this buffet cost more than the wicked spoon (which i love) for two ppl we payed about 65$ this buffet was worth 15.99 per person. will never return"}
{"text":"Do not come when it is slow. We went on a Thursday night, off season and did a walk through. The food looked good BUT when we started eating it, it was obvious the food had been out way too long. The rice on the sushi was so dry and hard that it fell off the seaweed when we picked it up and at the end of the night we watched the server repacking the sushi for the fridge. So, obviously it was not fresh and the fridge was drying out the rice. When it came to dessert, we tried 2 pieces of cake. I spit mine out. It had been sitting there so long that it was hard from being dried out. Obviously they are more concerned with waste than quality. However, the fresh made pasta station was great! The Mongolian beef was delicious. The shrimp was good too. I was afraid to try the crab legs, they looked old. All the staff were super friendly and the unlimited beer/wine for the price make the buffet worth it. It was $32/person and as long as you have 3 drinks, totally worth it since most drinks at the bars run a minimum of $12.00. I highly recommend that you go on a busy day if you want better food so you know it hasn't been left out all day or repackaged from the night before."}
{"text":"Good food, clean, large selection, friendly staff!

My husband and I have eaten at Cravings approximately 10 times. We've had brunches and dinners. We've always found the food to be prepared well, plentiful both in selection as well as quantity, the servers to be friendly and helpful and the establishment to be clean.

Some of our favorites are the prime rib, chilled (peeled and ready to eat) shrimp, crab legs, roasted chicken, omelette bar, unlimited wine and beer, and the desserts! YUM!

They also offer Ethnic choices such as Cajun, Asian, Italian and others.

If you're concerned about budget, I'd suggest buying the lunch buffet and going around 2:30pm. You'll get some of the dinner selections as well."}
{"text":"This is the best buffet I've ever had in Vegas.

First off, they have a crepe bar and gelato. Is there anything else that needs to be said?

Its pretty cost effective at about $20 a person. There's prime rib, crab legs, sushi, a salad station, pasta, pizza, comfort food, soups, etc.

The food is delicious, hot, and fresh.

The only downside is that it can get crowded, so you have to watch when you come or you may have a long wait ahead of you."}
{"text":"Went for the champagne brunch. Unlimited liquor is always an easy sell, but there's a lot of really good food here. I'm a vegetarian, and there really is a lot of good food: pizza, veggie sushi, freshly made salads, chilaquiles... So pleasant.
Hugs to this place."}
{"text":"poor food quality. I went this morning at 8 and everything was so dry. I just got up and walked away, that bad. I had a complimentary buffet because of MyVegas but don't spend your money here. The alcoholic drinks are complimentary but I saw a couple leave also after getting a mimosa. Just bad."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I am not a buffet person for sure . Not only it's a waste of time but a waste of money. My friend likes to eat at these places so I decided to participate and give it a shot! Not sure if it's the location but the food it's not good . The food taste out of content and the presentation was very poor. Again maybe it's just me because I am not into buffets but I am more about quality than quantity!"}
{"text":"Its a decent buffet another 3.5stars. Not my preference because of the selections they carry. The food here is good if you like seafood but i'm not a fan of  crab and such so its a huge waste of money for me to come here. Its a standard international style buffet with italian, asian, american etc food. This is only buffet I know that has a gyro and paninis made to order. They also have gelato. My favorite thing to eat were the caramel pecan tarts. 

I wouldn't come back on my own for 25 bucks. I missed 1/2 of the buffet because i'm such a plain eater. I only like fried stuff and comfort food like mashed potatoes, corn , fried chicken and the like. What I did have tasted pretty good so I left feeling satisfied and thats what counts."}
{"text":"Went for dinner.  There were different stations latin, asian, italian, american.  With not very many selections.  The meat carving station was pretty good, I had the prime rib.  There were plenty of desserts to choose from.  Frozen yogurt was good.  They also had unlimited house beers and wine.  Beers are all Lite beers and there were 4 choices of wine."}
{"text":"Wow squared' 
Been here a few times and have always advocated for the buffet and The Mirage over all. 

Just can't this time. 
5 1/2 hr drive from LA with TN ( 1st time) guest,  I was selling cravings big time. 

Arriving to the  pay  line at 3:05 we were charged for dinner VS lunch; but what was being served was lunch left overs! 

I called over the floor manager who called out the chef , who I told of my disappointment with the quality of food VS my prior times here-  telling him it was like being at 2 different restaurants. 

He quickly had the crew change out some of the entrees but it was to late - 2 hrs later and I conclude Cravings is no more the quality buffet it once was. 
Food lacked flavor. 
Trust me, I really wanted it to be good. 


I'm embarrassed I sold it so high to my guest."}
{"text":"Once again the Mirage seems to be cutting corners.  The addition of free beer/wine is nice, but you do have to get it yourself--along with any other beverages.  The servers used to take your drink orders and keep your soft drinks refilled.  Gone is a way to help them get more tips.  

Also the cooking stations are noticeably smaller than my last visit.  There is a lot more empty wall space in between the stations.  The salad station used to have an attendant that would assemble and toss salads to order.   Gone.

Mirage, if you are listening, please stop cutting staff positions!"}
{"text":"Have tried dinner here on two occasions..some of the best prime rib on the Strip..excellent BBQ selections..off the casino floor, so its nice and quiet.."}
{"text":"Food is great but the drink servers can't seem to make the time to come around and get our drinks refilled (let alone initially filled). They are mostly busy with bussing tables. Management should have dedicated bussers here. It's not the servers fault, they just are over worked. 

This simple mismanagement overshadows anything else in my opinion. With buffets and restaurants all over the place in Vegas, you have to do the basics well."}
{"text":"Not impressed by this buffet at all, but at least I got it for free! They had a large variety of foods, much like the newer buffets around. Sadly, their quality is severely lacking.  The carving station was very inconsistent. My prime rib was dreadful, but my bf had a good piece. I also made the mistake of trying some ham, which was salty and dry. As for the seafood section, the crab was actually okay... not awesome but okay.  The shrimp cocktail was not fresh at all though. They had smoked salmon which can't go wrong at all. 

Desserts: the only thing that appealed to me were the coconut macaroon cookies. The ONLY good dessert. That's really sad because I love sweets."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices, few choices of beer and wine. Way better than the last buffet we tried. Clean and well maintained. Clearly a local hot spot as busy as it was! Favorite thing are the mini dessert cups! So delicious. People seem to love the crab legs!"}
{"text":"After reading some mediocre reviews about it this buffet I was a bit hesitant with no intention of eating here. The day we arrived we were starving so we said screw it and ate there. It was close to the dinner changeover time so while we were eating the glorious crab legs came out. The were HUGE and stayed refilled. They were always warm and fresh and delicious. So so good.  So we decided to go for breakfast the next day. Seriously great spread. The breakfast burritos and chilaquiles were outstanding. I couldn't get enough of the French toast and warmed syrup with the strawberries. The pastry table had a huge selection. And my absolute favorite tho g was at the carving station. The applewood smoked bacon. Oh. My. GOD!!!!!!!! ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING."}
{"text":"I really liked the variety the Mirage buffet offered.  Asian, carved meat, italian, etc.  I like it better than Paris buffet."}
{"text":"Decided to try buffet at mirage and it was ok. Nothing special except dessert in small neat portions. Went there at dinner time Saturday night with my wife to have diner. They have crab legs, prime rib and corned beef. Tried almost every food there. Crab legs were super watery, salty and small, prime rib and corned beef wasn't great(not best cuts of meat), sushi was bland. It's good place if you want relatively cheap meal and if you can't decide what you feel like. Server was good always keep our table clean, unlimited house wine and beer (goose island ipa and bud light) which was nice cause usually one beer is $6-8 per glass anywhere. It's worth it if you like wine and Bert and don't care of brand. Desserts were good and I had quiet bit of them(they also have massive selection of sugar free stuff). Almost all food was under salted but I understand that not everyone likes salty food but salt and pepper available at the tables. Lines were long bit if you have pearl or above mlife card then you skip lines (we did yay). We also used 2 for 1 voucher from myvegas app. No problems with redeeming rewards. Just make sure you head to mlife desk so they can load it to your card. Overall if you have comps or vouchers or coupons it's definitely worth it. For under $30 for 2 people? Can't have it anywhere else."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Worth it for the unlimited beer wine and mimosas. Salad bar was nice to have something fresh. Sushi sucked but to be expected. Recommend if you go for mediocre food but lots of drinks"}
{"text":"went to buffet for lunch stupidly thinking I was going to get crab legs. No crab legs just a lot of subpar buffet food.aid $25 for food that tasted like food court fare.  Yuck don't wais your money"}
{"text":"Visited twice for breakfast. The first was comped and second time was simply because it was convenient. Everything was average. Drink stations are self serve with plenty of options. Dessert was below average. Veggie options weren't really available. Sign says salad station but didn't have any salad options for the breakfast.  The meat eaters in my group seemed happy with the selections."}
{"text":"I love having sushi & beer for breakfast, with a custom made-to-order omelette, with a French vanilla cappuccino & some other non-breakfast type items!!

The price isn't bad & the table servers are really fast & friendly!! The second you leave an empty plate beside you, someone comes to pick it right up & remove it!! The food is good no matter what you want & they have most food genres.. They also have UNLIMITED BEER & WINE!!! 

for the Saturday brunch, it's way more expensive, but they have unlimited mimosas & wine also.. 

Very fun buffet, had to hit this place up every morning we stayed!!"}
{"text":"Many choices here, environment is nice, servers are good and friendly.

I love the name - cravings"}
{"text":"Really great buffet!

Of course there were some things that weren't as good as others - like the Mac N Cheese: my husband and I both thought it looked way better than it was. It just was too watered down and didn't taste like much of anything even though it looked very cheesy and yum.

Everything else was pretty fantastic that we tried-- prime rib was AMAZING. First cut we had was medium, and it was good but not what we were craving. Then they brought out a more rare cut and it was SO good. You know it's good prime rib though when even the more cooked pieces are still flavorful and easy to chew. 

The sushi was yummy as were the soups- the wonton soup was probably our favorite but the scallop chowder was great. The pizza was pretty good as well and the crab legs and shrimp were on point.

The dessert was fantastic!!! Almost didn't have room for it. The chocolate gelato was yummy as well as the creme brûlée-- I mean really all of the dessert we had as absolutely delicious.  

For $37 a person on Memorial Day weekend AND FREE HOUSE WINE AND BEER!!!!

It was a GREAT deal!"}
{"text":"A clean environment with a large assortment of ethnic cuisines and food types to choose from. They had southern food, a carving station, Mexican, Japanese, raw seafood, pasta station, Chinese and a dessert section. One thing that distinguishes this buffet though is the unlimited alcoholic beverages and the cool self serve drinking stations. Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"The dilemma for having buffet is that they have over 500 kinds of food and how you gonna take them all.
My solution is take the food I like first and then take the most expensive dish in the buffet. Lobster. 
The have nice and actually awesome cupcakes and each and every kind looks cute. And the seating for the is spacious. Worth to take a shot."}
{"text":"It used to have a bigger selection but they closed the back wall. It's one of the better buffets. But nothing amazing. Dinner is a lot more worth then breakfast. Breakfast does not even have a omelet/pancake station which I thought was weird."}
{"text":"So last weekend my mom and I did a weekend trip to Vegas. And we decided to eat at Cravings because we saw they had food from all over. The hostess refused to give us a military discount even though I am a veteran and had a military id to show that I did serve in the air force. Then it was $72 for the two of us. So I'm thinking with that outrageous price, the food would be amazing... NO! Pretty much everything was cold and disgusting, with the exception of the turkey we got from the carving station. (Kudos to those guys because they made amazing turkey). Overall it was an overpriced and horrible experience. I wouldn't recommend anyone ever going there."}
{"text":"My first time here about a year ago, I could not get enough of this buffet. Eveything was fresh tasting, really delicious and the selection of food was great. They have everything from sushi rolls, pizza, BBQ chicken, soup, buffalo wings, snowcrab legs, artichoke dip, potstickers, roast turkey & beef, paninis, pasta, sandwich wraps...you name it.

Came back here last night and it wasn't as good as I remembered it to be. Not sure if I wasn't as hungry as my first time, or if it really was just not as good.

I'd suggest if you want to come here, do it when it's lunch, it's cheaper than dinner."}
{"text":"Came here with my buddies for dinner on a Saturday night.  Went to get the \"coupon\" from Tix4Tonight before coming here.  Paid $2 each person for the coupon and went straight to Cravings around 7:45p-8pm (Saturday night).  Surprisingly, there was NO LINE! We were quickly seated by the friendly staff.  We paid $25 ea at the restaurant ($27 ea after the coupon).  

This buffet had the normal range of choices including salad, soups, sushi, pizza, carving station, snow crab legs (hot and cold), etc.  They also had the Coke Freestyle machines so you can choose what soda combination you want.  Also included in the price was unlimited beer and wine (beer selection was limited to Bud Light or Blue Moon and their own wine selection).  

To start off, I got some sushi, but was a little disappointed with the lack of selection.  There was not the usual assortment of nigiri and only had what I believe was yellowtail.  No salmon or tuna.  Taste was alright, not the greatest, but not the worse.  

My first cut of prime rib was well done and did not taste that great at all, but I ended up eating it anyway.  Gave it another shot when one of my buddies got a cut that had some red to it.  That piece was a lot better!  He gave me the smallest sliver, which I took because I was getting full, but the person behind me asked for a thick piece and was given one.  

I went back for 2-3 plates of snow crab legs, as I always do, which was good, but not at the level of Bacchanal.  The legs were smaller and didn't have as much meat in them as some strip buffets, but tasted fine.  

They had a pretty good selection of dessert ranging from cakes to ice cream/frozen yogurt which was pretty good!  Only got the froyo and got some toppings as well.

Overall, it was a decent experience.  Not the best, but definitely not the worse.  We will likely be back to give it another shot.  The price with the coupon helped make it a little more worth it!  Next time, I want to try the chef's station that had fresh pasta."}
{"text":"So the food is ok, not the best. But the mimosas are what make this buffet. You just can't go wrong with all you can drink mimosas. That's the only reason I give this place four stars. 

As far as the food I like the alfredo pasta, chilaquiles and the donuts with honey."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the huge selection of food and found it to be flavorful and fresh.

I'm don't think it's worth $37.00/person (weekend dinner), but I used the MyVegas \"2 for 1\" discount  so it was slightly under $20.00/person. 

It includes \"all you drink\" beer  and wine (something new) so if you like to drink, it could be a deal for you, but when drinks are comped everywhere [in Vegas] it doesn't seem to be a big deal to me.

As already mentioned in other reviews, you have to go to the \"bar\" or \"drink station\" for all drinks and refills. So why would anyone leave a tip for the wait staff when you need to get your own drinks?

This is my 2nd or 3rd time here, but if you're having to pay the full price to eat here I strongly suggest you to consider going to the buffets at the Wynn, Bellagio, or Wicked Spoon (Cosmopolitan) before choosing Cravings."}
{"text":"Went in to try because of a bogo we got with mlife. 3 star only because there was unlimited
Wine and beer, but consider you tip the bartender and it adds up again. I don't know if I'll come
Back but it was just all right. Good coffee. Big drink station. Everything self serve. Fresh made pasta station was confusing I didn't see a menu of choices. One kind of crab and it was dry so has been sitting out for a while. Skip the Asian it's terrible. Soups were decent. Sushi was just ok. Meats were ok. I only found one dessert I actually liked and finished. Over unremarkable. We thought to try due to bogo coupon but still even at 35 bucks for 2 people I've had better buffets back home."}
{"text":"Since I found myself in the Mirage, I decided to try the buffet here and found it decent.  Their dessert section was a bit lacking since it tended to lack variety (all being stuff I usually don't eat) and they did have a variety of items but nothing really special.  I prefer the buffet at Paris' over this."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch of a Saturday. It was $40 which included unlimited drinks (Bloody Mary, mimosas, wine, etc). We thought it was great. Nice variety of food for a brunch. We were able to hang out, relax and enjoyed it very much. I have eaten at other buffets in Vegas that were more expensive, and this one compared very favorably."}
{"text":"One evening my friends didn't want to go to dinner and I was starving so I went down to Cravings. They had the to-go option for $16 which was an amazing offer. I got so much food it was unbelieveable and a fraction of the cost of staying in the restaurant. I took my to go bag up to the room and my friends were amazed at the amount of food I got in to my container. I would certainly recommend this option to anyone looking for a cheaper meal, rushed for time, solo dining or just wanting to try this option. Simply loved this buffet."}
{"text":"It was better than average, and if yelp allowed half stars I would rate it 3 1/2 stars. The food was good but not spectacular. I had the Mongolian beef, white rice, egg rolls and pork pot stickers. The pot-stickers were my favorite of the bunch. I also had a little tri-tip, tamales and ceviche. For the ceviche, I didn't see any tostadas, so I went to the nacho section and grabbed some  tortilla chips, it was perfect :) I wish they would of had some fried shrimp, I was really craving it. They don't bring your drinks to the table therefore you have to keep going to the beverage section to get more. That doesn't see like much, but when you're seated at the far end of the buffet, it was a little annoying. One thing I loved was their desserts. My favorite being the crepe station...delicious!!"}
{"text":"Große Auswahl, frisch, lecker, Getränke inklusive.
Wir waren in der Nebensaison beim Cravings Buffet im Mirage essen und es ist bei weitem das beste Angebot was wir finden konnten. Nirgendwo sonst bekommt man für diesen geringen Preis (Ca. 15 inklusive Tax, Lunch, Montag-Freitag. Abendessen und Wochenende ist teurer) unendlich viel Essen UND Getränke (sogar inklusive Bier und Wein). Man sollte aber nicht direkt beim Restaurant zahlen, sondern sich vorher einen Discount Voucher bei einem Partner holen (z.B. tix4tonight), sonst ist es wesentlich teurer. Die Auswahl ist sehr groß und die Qualität des Essens tadellos. Die Gerichte sind in die Kategorien Latin, American, Asian, Sushi, Italian, Chef's kitchen und Grill eingeteilt. An Soft Drinks gibt es aus den Automaten praktisch alles was man sich vorstellen kann, dazu noch Säfte, Eistee und Kaffee/Capuccino.
Das Hotel und Casino an sich ist von der Innenarchitektur her nicht das schönste in Las Vegas, doch alles war sauber und gepflegt. 
Preis/Leistung ist hier unübertroffen, vor allem in Las Vegas, wo man gerne mal 15 für ein paar Nüsse aus der Minibar bezahlen muss. Wir können es jedem nur empfehlen."}
{"text":"Good all you can eat and drink(including alcohol) place!
There're crab legs, big choice of tasty desserts and good quality food!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this buffet enough to eat her twice during our stay.  There is a good variety of different types of food - everyone should be able to find something good to eat.  There is not an extensive selection, but it is comrehensive.  The sushi was very good, and I was pleasantly surprised to say so - since that often isn't the case at a buffet.

The staff were very helpful, my mother-in-law was riding a power scooter during our visit and our hostess parked it out of the way for us, and told us that she would bring it right back to the table when we were done.  I ended up doing that myself, but it was nice to have the option.

There is free beer and wine - but not being a big drinker myself I stuck to the unlimited soda, which is served from those great \"select your own mix\" machines that I've seen in many places now.  

I heard some people say there wasn't a large variety and selection for dessert, but I managed to fill up a whole plate with different items so I'm not sure what they are talking about.  Maybe they are pickier than I am.

Overall - good food, good service, good price, will probably eat here again."}
{"text":"Pretty good choice for breakfast! The buffet offers a lot of variety for everyone. We arrived later in the breakfast time and everything was hot and constantly being changed out for more. The bacon and eggs were great! There are 4 wines, mimosas, and 2 beers that are included unlimited with your purchase of the buffet. We only had the mimosas and they were great! Service at the bar was slow though. The eggs Benedict was bland tasting. We ate breakfast, took a break to have some drinks while they changed our the buffet to lunch, then we ate lunch and had more drinks! Worth the money for the buffet. Will be back! We were more than filled and happy with all the options."}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent. Prime rib varied in doneness. The best thing about this buffet was the all you can drink bud light draft! Also another beer and a few wines. But even when we left the bartender put our beers in to go cups! (You have to ask)."}
{"text":"This place was great considering we got a travel zoo deal for $13 pp including bottomless mimosas! The pizza and prime rib were surprisingly good and the mini cupcakes and gelato are tasty, too."}
{"text":"I really did not enjoy the buffet here at the Mirage 

There was a long line and by the time we got to the front we were told that they would be closing in 30 minutes. They did not refresh the buffets and the food quality was poor and looked sloppy

Won't be back, not worth the money or the wait"}
{"text":"This is a solid 3-star place. 3 stars aren't bad. Especially when it comes to a Vegas buffet! This is probably one of the better deals in Vegas, especially if you go for lunch because beer and wine are included with your meal. And I loved that they have an interesting watermelon beer as an option! Solid salad bar, omelette station, Italian (Asian station was sub-par). Overall, not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Complete let down. We visited right after it reopened a few years back and it was really good and high quality. Now, not so much. 

Nothing stood out, the Prime Rib was tough and had no flavor, the mashed potatoes were over worked and gummy. I have had better sushi from the grocery store. I choose not to even try the dessert. Only saving grace was it was a free meal, but i would have rather paid for a meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"Cravings offers convenience as a buffet in the Mirage. I am an MLife member and play their online game regularly so I had more than enough points to swap for a Buy One, Get One dining experience. So for us, the $35 wasn't a bad deal at all for dinner.

There is a wide variety of the foods. You will be full before trying it all.  It does have the standards of sushi, crab legs, and shrimp. I did enjoy the cut prime rib. 

All soft drinks, wine and beer are included in the price of the meal. For a heavy beer drinker you would be able to get your moneys worth in drinks."}
{"text":"I used a reward from playing myvegas. We had a 2 for 1 dinner. Food was ok.  I did enjoy the unlimited beer and wine. The prim rib was good. I had a tab bit of salt though.   The crab was a bit salty though.  The best dishbthat i had was a peppered beef from the asian area. Omg it was so good!!! I would only return if i had another reward from myvegas"}
{"text":"I liked Cravings! The food selection was pretty large. I liked that they had it separated by different themes like Asian, Mexican, and Breakfast. Try the little shrimp shumai-they won't disappoint! I cannot say  I liked the dessert portion very much, which is sad, considering how much of a sweet tooth I have! Overall , you cannot beat the selection, unrushed buffet environment, and of course an excuse to visit the Mirage."}
{"text":"This buffet was really good.  They had lots of options and we got it for free because of the deal we reserved.  Everything you could want.  My two main complaints are that the omelette station can get long and take forever and they serve your drinks to make tips, which always annoys me at a buffet.  They can be slow to get you drinks too."}
{"text":"For three weeks i have been waiting for this amazing buffet experience but have been let down with just pure disappointment. Before i went on my vegas vacation all my co workers have urged me to go to Le village buffet at Paris but i figured why not just go to the buffet that is closer, considering the fact that i was staying at the Mirage and didnt want to go through the hassle of leaving the hotel and driving through the traffic just for a buffet. Little did i know that this Cravings buffet was just awful. 

It was about 30 dollars per person, im not going to bitch about the price because everything in vegas is going to be expensive. I understand that majority of the buffets are about this price, so whatever right? I am a big seafood fan so i immediately went to the sushi bar and grabbed a tuna sushi with an avocado roll and a tuna roll. When i went back to my seat i noticed that the rice on the roll was stale and hard. I didnt even eat it. The tuna sushi was AWFUL it was a tiny little piece that was turning brown!!! i left it on the side of my plate because i didnt even want to touch it. 

I did enjoy the shrimp..so i grubbed on shrimp until i was sick of shrimp..
I figured that they couldnt mess up on salad and their salad bar was pretty good. 

but overall this was not a memorable experience. well..memorable yes..but in a bad way."}
{"text":"Upon our arrival to the Mirage, we were all hungry so we went to Cravings. There were lots of choices and I'd have to say everything was cooked quite well. It wasn't expensive as I believe it was $16ish a person. I especially enjoyed the won ton noodle soup and a few of their other offerings which I cannot remember anymore. I ate a lot of food that weekend, so most of it is a blur.

Dessert, I enjoyed the bread pudding. It was yummm.

This place is very spacious compared to the other buffets out there, definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"i was excited to try Cravings at the MIrage, as this was my first time going to this buffet.  I love the Mirage, overall as a resort.

We went for the brunch buffet on a Saturday  at about 12noon.  It was $35.99 per person including unlimited wine, beer, and mimosas.  

We were redeeming a Buy 1, Get 1 Free promotion through the My Vegas Mobile App Slot Promotion.  The redemption process was easy with just 1 single stop at the players club before going to the restaurant.

Once we arrived, we waited in line less than 5 minutes and were seated quickly and that process was very efficient.

We also noticed that the layout of this buffet was great, allowing for people to flow through the stations quickly.  It never really seemed crowded because of this.  

All non-alcoholic beverages were self-serve.  Wine and Beer were obtained at the bar.  Champagne was obtained by the server.

As far as the food, I was only slightly impressed.  The desserts were pretty good; however, we both agreed that per our tastes, only about half of the dishes exceeded our expectations, and the others could have been greatly improved upon.  After eating at the Palms Bistro Buffet the evening before, we thought the tastes of many entrees here lacked in comparison.  We also felt it lacked in comparison to others we have been to in the past.  

This is not to say that we did not like it; however, if we would not have been redeeming the Buy 1, Get 1, we might have even given it a 2.  

In the world of Vegas Buffets, they are also changing things up.  Maybe I will try it again in the future, after trying several more."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast and it was not bad.  The omlette station was good and they had a good assortment of baked goods to hot food ratio.
As there is so much food at buffets I'm just going to say if the food tastes like its suppose to meaning ham tastes like ham and not like chicken, then its probably on the right track

Decor:4
Food:3
Service:3

Would I go back? Although I'm not huge on buffets, Sure."}
{"text":"This place had some fantastic ribs, the barbecue in general was really good, the sushi is definitely not their strong point, so if you go to buffets for the sushi this is not the spot for you. The unlimited alcohol was a big plus, they had a pretty good Chardonnay and Cabernet, this was definitely surprising as it was free alcohol, the wine alone makes the price reasonable if you like to drink wine as I do. I would definitely recommend this place for a good buffet, but not a great one"}
{"text":"Horrible! Selection is average and the food matches up to it. The chairs itself are crap, feeling like a cafeteria. Being a person with a sweet tooth the dessert was very pathetic, hardly any selection and although they offer made \"crepes\" the maker doesn't know how to make them correctly, dredging them in oil after 10 minutes. Instead, head to TI's buffet practically across the street, a dollar difference but significantly superb."}
{"text":"Well this was my first buffet experience in Vegas and man!! I was impressed! I came in for lunch and got a free upgrade with drinks! Can't complain about that! The food was pretty good with so many options! Everything you could think of was offered! The salad bar station was amazing! My favorite was the dessert station with these amazing purple cream filled macaroons that we to die for! I love macaroons and these passed the test!! I could eat until the next day after going here! The service was also great with quick clearing and friendliness!"}
{"text":"The guacamole here is very good!!! Desserts were delicious!  Cannot complain, unlimited alcohol!"}
{"text":"My mom and I spent the weekend in Vegas for her birthday and on our last few trips, we've been trying to get out and about to some of the highly-rated buffets we haven't visited before. Cravings lived up to its reputation.

We walked right in and were seated immediately. I think we came right between breakfast and lunch so it was pretty quiet but everything was available and the food was excellent. I filled my plate up with Asian selections before I even made it to the other side of the buffet so I had to go back for a second plate. :P 

The dessert offerings were impressive as well. There were plenty of sugar-free options which was nice. 

Definitely enjoyed this buffet and I would absolutely come here again in the future."}
{"text":"It's amazing how in a short period of time the level of service and quality of food goes down. All food except from Chef's Kitchen is cold. Not to mention not a server in site to give condiments that you would think would be on the table. Totally disappointed for the almost $80 we paid."}
{"text":"I've been to Vegas many many times and have eaten at a variety of buffets. I have to say that Cravings has to be one of the best I have ever been too. A lot of variety, delicious desserts, and fresh, hot food.  I definitely will return when we come back again."}
{"text":"Ate here with hubby and adult daughter.  Mirage was always my favorite casino when I came to Vegas frequently in the 90s.  Did not seem run down or tired to me as some reviews suggest.  It's a buffet folks. . you're going to like some of the food and not like some.  I found it to be a typical selection for a casino buffet dinner.  I especially like the crab,  sushi,  shaved parmesan and italian sliced meats.  My hubby and daughter both found selections they really liked.  The wine was surprisingly good for \"free\" (I had chardonnay, daughter had Moscato). AND really liked that there was a full bar for hubby to have his Grey Goose martini. Service was impeccable.  No wait."}
{"text":"This is one of the best buffets I've been to in Vegas! It's inside the  The Mirage. Many different stations including a carving station with prime rib and turkey, Spanish station, Asian,  Italian, etc. The price is reasonable and includes soft drinks, beer or wine."}
{"text":"First off, $28 for dinner. Ouch. But it's Vegas and I'm not much of a gambler so my money has to go SOMEWHERE, right?

So the line wasn't too bad when we got here at around 6 PM. I must say though I was impressed with how it took about 20 minutes to seat us when there were clearly open tables. Maybe to ensure we'd start off towards the food at a comfortable get-the-hell-out-of-my-way pace? If so, mission accomplished Cravings Buffet.

They had an Italian station, 2 Asian stations, a carving station, a Mexican food station, a salad station, and a desert section where there's a hidden gelato station at the far right corner past the desert bar; it's not self serve though so be prepared to bug someone to get you delicious strawberry gelato.

I got 3 plates of food and finished about half of each because I was so overwhelmed. I got the prime rib which was delicious for being carved from a buffet station. It was medium rare and lovely and pink, very flavorful. The pastas were alright (al dente but the sauces were average) and the ceviche was just ok. Not enough citrus, in my opinion. The asian stations were more flavorful and the barbecue pork buns were nice and perfectly steamed. I strongly recommend getthing the chipotle mashed potatoes though.

(Note: If you want the perfect plate, get a slice of prime rib, a side of chipotle mashed potatoes with turkey gravy, a made-to-order salad from the salad bar, and some corn bread. So. Good.)

The sushi station was measly and didn't even look good enough to try though. I've seen better looking sushi at Chinese buffets. 

Oh, but the desert station! Little pies!! I'm a weirdo for mini versions of things, like some girls. They had mini Dutch Apple Pie, mini raspberry pie (filling had souffle consistency) mini pecan pie, and a mini peanut butter pie. They were all scrumptious and adorable! The passion fruit infused cake with orange and strawberry slices on top was both aesthetically pleasing and subtly sweet. The strawberry gelato was very, very bold flavored and the cookies and cream flavor was a miss. The chocolate one was probably the best.

The service was not that great. It shouldn't be a big deal for a buffet if the waiters are good or not but the tables were kind of small and the plates were huge so it was noticeable when we'd been unattended for half an hour and even the ice in my water is gone. Because I ate my ice cubes as a form of hydration. Bad bad baaaaaaad.

The setting was pretty nice, contemporary American theme going and the stations had their respective titles above them to keep from having lines and long wait times to get food. 

I would go again, if there were coupons or I'd try that tip to go for lunch prices but dinner items."}
{"text":"Terrible buffet, probably the worst dinner and breakfast buffet I have been to in Las Vegas. Buffet areas were not very clean. Food was horrible. we first tried for dinner and ate hardly anything and left. They include alcohol in their price but we don't drink so this buffet was quite pricy. They should charge an additional charge if you want to drink and lower the price of the buffet, not to mention once again the food was quite terrible. The breakfast buffet was quite bland and not much of a selection. It almost look like they put out left overs from the dinner buffet the night before. quite strange. Don't waste your money. Never again......."}
{"text":"I love it here.. 

Their food is awesome.. and they have many selections.. 

They have several soups too.. and you know I love my soups!

Their plates are nice and big.. interesting too.. 

They make it seem like a huge buffet.. but it's set up where different themes are sectioned off.. the spaces between each section is rather large.. very spacey..

But it's ok.. it's like getting a workout while eating at the same time..

Their desserts were good.. 

I love coming to this buffet.."}
{"text":"It is pretty good and everything is fresh.  But don't get a panini or gyros because they use the same oil and it leave brownish thickish stuff on your sandwich.  There is this really, really, really, really, really,(+100 reallys) nice guy called alberto and he is really friendly and funny."}
{"text":"I visited Cravings Buffet for lunch yesterday. Save your money, don't go!! There are so many other buffets out there. I came here because I thought it would have a good variety but it didn't deliver. I haven't been to a Las Vegas buffet in a couple of years so I was looking forward to pigging out. I was extremely disappointed with the food selection and quality. I would have given it no stars but that is not an option for Yelp. The sushi was probably premade and refrigerated since the rice was hard and didn't seem freshly made --just like the store-bought kind. I only sampled food that looked appealing but most of it wasn't. Looks can be deceiving, the decent looking food wasn't very good at all either. The only item that I enjoyed was the prime rib. I had two servings since there wasn't really anything else that was any good. I could have saved money if I just went to a restaurant where I just ordered prime rib. There were fish and chips and the batter was thick without much crunch. The fries were ok but like the other food just didn't seem freshly made. 

I have a sweet tooth so I saved my stomach for dessert since there wasn't really much else to eat but the dessert left me unsatisfied as well. Cookies were overbaked; they were hard and dried out. Oatmeal and chocolate cookies are supposed to be soft and chewy but not theirs. Just wasted calories eating their desserts. The cake was dry and stale. The fruit tart didn't have much flavor and wasn't crisp. I guess it was day old dessert or something. The dessert items were so bad that I never even finished any of them. The desserts look good but they are not even worth trying.

I think the only thing going for the buffet is the free beer, wine, champagne, and mimosas when I was there. Maybe that might be the reason some people rate the buffet higher than it deserves. I didn't partake in the alcoholic beverages because I was driving home that afternoon but I would prefer good food over free alcohol.

Stay away from Cravings Buffet at the MIrage or you will regret it. It was Mother's day weekend so I ended paying a premium for that crap they called food. I really don't know how such a major hotel casino can serve food like that."}
{"text":"Now THIS is HANDS DOWN the BEST Buffet on the Strip!  Great food for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.  At breakfast, you can have \"made-to-order\" omelets or eggs any style, pancake, french toast, Belgium waffles.  Basically anywhere from 8-11 stations that include, American, Italian, Asian, Mexican, Fishmongers, Carved Meats, Salads, Cheese and Cold Cuts, Bread, Desserts, Drinks, Coffee, Tea, Beer & Wine (which is included in your bill).  Great place to get your grub on."}
{"text":"Well my wife and ate here for brunch on the complementary buffet for two courtesy of booking a room at the Monte Carlo through Expedia.  It was a Sunday morning so they were serving mimosas with your meal.  Not a bad start..  As we navigated our way through the buffet if found a decent cooked prime rib..  Next was the pho noodle soup..  Legit! Then I found the cold seafood..  Disappointed..  The crab legs had that fishy smell to it as it was not fresh.  I didn't want to ruin our anniversary trip by spending my time on the porcelain throne  so I took one bite and passed.  The desserts were decent but I have had better else where. Considering that our meal was complementary I would say that it was not bad.  We were full until dinner time. 

I think it was appropriately 56 bucks if our meals were not on Expedia.  Other than that I would not pay for it.  If your going with the free Expedia meal just a note..  This place had better yelp reviews then the other 5 or 6 places that you have to choose from on the complementary buffet list.  Hope this helped you..  Enjoy yourself in Vegas and don't forget to tip your dealers.  =)"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of Vegas buffets as I just feel I can't eat enough to make it worth my while.

This was ok- the eggs seemed fresh, bacon crispy ... We caught it as they were switching over to lunch. I was surprised by the freshness and hot temp of food- I think there is just so many people eating that the food goes quickly and doesn't sit.

I was disappointed in the plantains - too much cinnamon ... And when I hit other buffets I swear the same plantains were at the other buffets too."}
{"text":"This review mainly goes to the staff at the Cravings Buffet. Do not get me wrong, the food was spectacular, but the staff is what made my experience so impeccable.

I went to brunch with my ladies for my best friend's birthday and we chose to come here as our location, since we received a credit from the hotel. What sold us what the bottomless mimosas. Everyone knows you can't have brunch without mimosas and, wow, did those mimosas keep coming. Whenever our glass was almost empty, Brandon, one of the waiters, made sure to refill our glasses. He was so attentive to our table and we really appreciate it.

I happened to get some fried rice from the Asian cuisine station, after I had enough breakfast food, and noticed that the rice wasn't fresh. All the other food was so delicious and I didn't want that one thing to be ruined. So I told Brandon that the rice didn't taste right and without me knowing that he was even going to do anything about it, I'm greeted 15 minutes later by Fausto Vela, the Asst. Main Kitchen-Chef, with a huge fresh plate of fried rice for my ladies and I. He said \"I hope this is to your liking and if it isn't then we'll make it again.\" Trust me, it was SOOO SCRUMPTIOUS! So tasty. I was extremely thankful and when I'm in Vegas again I'll be sure to visit and thank them for such a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"WHY WE WENT HERE:
- we dedicated the \"only meal of the day\" for a buffet lunch
- the first buffet we went to (which was located in another hotel, I forget which and its name) turned us down because we had several guys in our group who didn't have sleeved shirts on upon entrance

THE LOOK (FROM THE OUTSIDE/INSIDE):
- hard to miss an open space that has nothing but food
- looks somewhat like a food court

THE WAY IT WORKS:
- go in from the entrance, where the cash registers are
- pay for your meal and indicate how many are in your party
- you are then assigned seating according to how big your party is
- unlimited beer and wine go along with your buffet meal

WHAT THEY HAVE:
- desserts
- cold items (i.e. meats and cheeses like when you drink wine; salad area)
- Asian
- Latino
- American
- Carving
- Italian
- bar
- Seafood

WHAT WE HAD:
- a little bit of everything
- the Latino portion was just sad and not authentic at all
- the Asian portion was fairly decent
- the cold items portion was only good from the meats and cheeses; the salads didn't look fresh
- the desserts were just ok
- the carving and seafood stations were on point! (I wouldn't know about the seafood personally, but a lot of the people in my group kept going back to that station)
- some of the things in the Italian section were selectively better than others (i.e. pasta)

CUSTOMER SERVICE:
- the register people aren't pleasant
- the seating attendants are VERY welcoming
- the bartender worked fairly slow and had a hard time remembering our 2 drinks we ordered"}
{"text":"This is a good place. Lot of offerings. Sushi was my fav incl fresh seaweed salad. A wow 4 shelf of desserts. Brisket was meh, good seafood but simply made. Did not try breakfast stuff or italian. Korean was too salty. Latin has some nice peppers

Place is quite big. My fav approach, go and take my time, reading a book and making it a multi course meal."}
{"text":"I know this might undermine my credibility some, but Cravings was probably my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. It's like a college dining hall--except all the food is REALLY. GOOD. All eating rules of propriety are thrown out the window--eat as much as you want, fast. Mix whatever you want. Have seven different entrees. Take six desserts and have a bite of each. Really--this was one of the better dining experiences of my life. Make sure you bring along fun/food-happy people, though--it makes all the difference.

The highlight was probably the \"dipping\" portion of our \"appetizer\" section. Tons of chips and crisps and the like, with guacamole, spinach-artichoke, cheese dip, and salsa. Like heaven.

For Las Vegas, reasonably priced, too."}
{"text":"One of the best buffets I have ever experienced in Las Vegas.
This is a not miss place for great tasting food and great atmosphere.
Very clean, food always fresh, does not feel like a buffet. 
You won't be disappointed if you go there.
Off-peak times are best."}
{"text":"went for brunch on saturday morning. the place looks cool, it's clean and well-decorated. good service, never in need of a mimosa refill, she was right on top of it.

the crab and shrimp were rockin, the prime rib excellent, the gyro delicious, omelette lovely, good lox, really good pizza for a buffet....

and lots and lots more food that i couldn't possibly try all of. sushi not so good, some at the table weren't thrilled with the mexican selections... but i don't think i've ever seen a good taco bar at a vegas buffet, nor had good sushi, so it's to be expected methinks.

all in all, all good. maybe not as good as the rio buffet."}
{"text":"Cravings - perhaps the name best represents your hunger pangs AFTER your meal. I was very unimpressed.

So let's begin -

The pros:

Serve-yourself drink station. They have that new-fangled Coke machine (actually, it's been out for a few years) that allows you to customize your own drinks (as long as the syrup is part of the Coke family). Milk, coffee, cappuccino (don't get too excited - we're talking about the ones you find at the gas station mart).

Complimentary wine and beer. I cannot comment on this, since I did not partake.

A wide range of stations (Asian, Latin, Italian, et al).

The cons:

Remember that cappuccino machine? I tried a Vanilla Cappuccino, and it tasted watery. Evidently someone forget to check the powder level for the mix.

The food is seriously sub-par. Prime rib was cooked medium rare, but was inexplicably tough. The Asian foods were scary ick - sushi was sub-sub par (according to my wife), the shu mai (a type of dim sum) was mushy and tasteless. My wife said that the mashed potatoes had the consistency of paste - too bad we didn't have reams of newspaper, I could have started a paper-mache project.

The dessert section deserves its own paragraph of ill repute. There is a machine that says \"gelato\" - unfortunately, it spews something more like ice milk (\"something that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike gelato\"). There was Boston Creme Pie, which somehow lacked the Creme portion (I guess you cannot call it \"Boston Pie\"?), a concoction called \"Equator\" that left a weird brown smear that resembled the slime left by an apoplectic snail after binging on bad cabbage. And worse - no cheesecake. I mean seriously - have you ever been to a casino buffet that did not offer cheesecake? That's like going to a diner south of the Mason-Dixon Line that didn't offer grits....

The one saving grace is that our dinner had been comped. But even then we somehow felt short-changed.

Pro Tips:

Go for dishes that cannot be ruined. Pasta, white rice - this trip probably wouldn't be the best time to start that gluten-free diet.

Join M-Life (the loyalty program at the casino). I know I sound like a shill, but if you're going to play the tables and machines, you might as well earn points.

Play MyVegas. We earned the comps via the game. It's free - and you can get free stuff. You too can be Mike and Trent (let's see who caught that reference)."}
{"text":"For a Buffet...this place was awesome!

Actually...this place doesn't need the \"For a Buffet\" disclaimer.

It has excellent food, of superior quality to many more expensive Vegas establishments ( HELLO...EMERIL...ARE YOU LISTENING? )...and the value can't be beat.

I don't normally attempt to actually EAT all that I CAN...but this place made me want to just keep going back for more.

We did the brunch menu...and it was LOADED.  Standard American breakfast fare...build yer own Omelette bar...delicious raw-bar...Latin and Asian inspired brunch items...plus dessert at 11am was a real treat.

Oh, did I mention the all-you-can-drink champagne / mimosas to go with it?

Yeah...there's that too.  

If you're busy on the floor of the Mirage Casino, and you get the munchies, this really is the place to get your fix.

And if you plan it just right...you can kill about 2 1/2 hours like we did just drinking your weight in champagne.

Opa!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, I think The Cravings buffet is worth the money. First of all, we can get 2-1 lunch/diner deal on myVegas so the price is half. Secondly, the buffet offers unlimited drinks, which is a plus. They also have an amazing drink station with so many selections that can comfort even the pickiest person. The food selection and quality are decent for this price. If you are a cheese lover, this place is for you. They have many expensive kinds of cheese. They often change the foods so you won't have the same dishes every times you go there. Overall is good and this place is always my food destination every time I go to Vegas"}
{"text":"I had seen this place on TV and was very excited to try it when in town on vacation. This place was clean and attractive. I loved the decor. In fact, it was probably my favorite decor of any restaurant I visited. It was something of a contemporary-60s-Frank-Lloyd-Wright sort of place. I really like it.
 
When it came to the food, that is what disappointed me. What appeared to be a very large buffet, was not as large as I suspected. There are very large tables spread around the perimeter. The food actually takes up a much smaller portion of the table. The tables looked nice... all about the presentation. Also, the food, representing different countries, was very authentic. This should score high-marks with many folks. I guess I like my exotic foods to me a little more Americanized. Don't get me wrong... it wasn't bad... it just wasn't my cup of tea. I would have liked it better if the food was a tad less exotic and there were more choices.
 
The dessert selection was a little stale and limited. Perhaps it was a result of bad timing. It's a gamble sometimes with a buffet.
 
I kept comparing it to a casino buffet in my hometown has has four times the selection of fresh, hot food with a less expensive price tag.
 
I'll return only if someone else wants to."}
{"text":"Sorry, after going to Wicked Spoon at The Cosmopolitan this place wasn't even on the same level. \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" explains it well, Yelp. Everything was just ok, and pretty much what you would expect from a Vegas buffet. If we hadn't been so hungover/hungry/walked all the way to Mirage already we wound't have stayed to eat, but it was a solid choice to feed a group of people who are just hungry.

If you have the option to go somewhere else, do it. There is to much to try and see in Vegas, don't waste your time here!

Note: This place is right off the casino, so be prepared to smell cigarettes the whole time you eat too..."}
{"text":"Came here on Christmas and I know they're busy but the food was so old.. it's like the buffet couldn't anticipate the amount of patrons and were pulling out yesterday's food just to keep up. The crabs were old and dry, meat (chicken, beef, steak etc.) were super salty and oddly chewy, so many stations were empty, overall just ridiculous - for the price we paid, we expected better food.
Gave two stars because our waitress was really nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Not the best buffet in Vegas.
The food selection consist of Italian, Mexican, Chinese, BBQ and sea.
There were not too many options at each and every one of the cuisines. Mexican was basically rice, guacamole, chicken and salsa. Italian was pizza and macaroni, Chinese looked like a skinny version of Panda Express and the BBQ... Well you can call it BBQ if all you like is baby back ribs and potatoes.
I gave it star instead of 2 because the staff was friendly and the dessert were good"}
{"text":"We went here before LOVE. I did do my research on buffets beforehand and selected this one not only based on location but also (relative) price and the fact that beer/wine were included. Personally, I was not impressed. I tried items from the salad bar, asian, mexican, american, and seafood, and dessert stations. Although the variety was nice, everything was just MEH. I did have a bite of my sister's pasta that was made to order, and that was quite good. A few of the mini desserts were tasty, but still nothing special. It was nice to have a few glasses of wine included, but it still didn't make the price of the buffet worth it given the quality of the food. I would pass."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Cravings while in town for our anniversary. We showed up around 4:30, and were charged the lower \"early bird\" rate. There was plenty to choose from. The star of the show was the Prime Rib.  The prime rib was very tender and moist, as was the carved roast turkey.  I had to grab seconds on the prime rib.  Decent ribs, bbq chicken, sushi.  I skipped the pizza. You can get pizza anywhere right? I ended up eating three plates, and managing to find a little room for dessert."}
{"text":"Wow - for a $25 dinner buffet in Vegas, this place probably has among the highest quality food - everything is prepared fresh, nothing sits there very long, and there's a pretty good variety - a few downsides, fresh seafood doesn't have too much variety but everything else is done pretty well..."}
{"text":"My favorite buffet in vegas.

Being able to customize a salad and then pick the dressing and have someone mix it all up for you... AMAMZING!

Everything I tried at this buffet was tasty."}
{"text":"Cravings is a very good buffet with well- tended food stations, heated plates and a broad selection of tasty, high quality food. The decor is a little odd- the dessert area looks like an automat- but not off- putting. The price is very reasonable for what you get. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Both hubby and I agree 3 star. When I asked for his star rating his comment was \"when you put potatoes in the Chinese food you get 3 stars\". It's pretty typical institutional style buffet food. We had 2 for 1 coupons for both breakfast and dinner. Here are some things of note:

- if you don't like crab or steak forget dinner for the price
- wine and beer are included even at breakfast 
- they have those cool soda machines that let you make pretty much any kind of soda
- they have sushi 
- there are lots of gluten free options and they are all marked
- salad bar is really teeny so if you are looking for salad, look somewhere else 
- omelette bar at breakfast is the best option

So my thought is the only way this is good for the price is if you plan on drinking a lot of beer and wine or eating a lot of crab legs. Otherwise play the free MyVEGAS games on your smartphone and get enough points for 2 for 1 like we did."}
{"text":"For the reputation of the casino, this is a horrible place to eat! 
You will feel you are eating at a high school cafeteria! No variety and you can taste the bad quality right after you finished your lunch/dinner! 
They include free alcohol but that's bud lights or the cheapest wine you be ever had!!
Avoid it at any cost!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday night, not wanting to leave the hotel. It didn't look like too many people were there, until actually getting into the restaurant. It was quite busy so that put me at ease because I've never tried this buffet before. They had a full international buffet with Italian, American, Japanese, Chinese, seafood, soul food, not to mention, the desserts, and A full alcohol bar. The service is great and the staff was really friendly.  I would definitely come here again if I was staying at the Mirage."}
{"text":"Food choices seemed excellent until every thing tasted salty. It got to the point where one bite was taken and you knew that that was the end of that food item. The smoked salmon tasted disgusting, as if it was left out for hours. Only edible items: beef pho and tiramisu."}
{"text":"Just as good as the top tier buffets in Vegas if not better! Dinner with crab, prime rib, wine included hard to beat. As locals we appreciate good value & Mirage Buffet is."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my buffet experience here. So many different options. The desert bar is insane! Probably one of the better buffets on the strip. I can't complain since my buffet was complimentary."}
{"text":"Cravings is perhaps one of the better buffets on the Strip. I come here at least once a month, and I don't mind coming here often because this is one of the few buffets that actually changes their selection. Other buffets always have the same crap day in and day out...and they don't care because tourists don't come often enough to notice the food is always the same. I like Cravings because they sometimes have congee...and their noodle soup is decent (not as good as Rio's Buffet). Their fried plantains are also great...as well as their lobster ravioli. Cut one open...you'll find large pieces of real lobster in each one! The cioppino is generally devoid of any taste or spice, but their clam chowder is always too salty. The ribs are pretty good and meaty but not fall off the bone tender. I do wish they would put some dumpling sauce for the pot stickers...the only choices are regular soy and red vinegar.  I like how they always have some different desserts...last month they installed doors to their dessert display. Although the desserts are kept cooler now, it SUCKS when both your hands are holding desserts---I guess just leave the door open for the next glutton? Their gelato is generally too soft. And it doesn't help that they put it in a very warm bowl. So by the time you get back to your seat, you have gelato soup. Most of the time, there isn't someone manning the gelato, so you have to wait. And most of the time, you have to wait a long time. I also like how they have chocolate sauce and vanilla sauce in a pitcher so you can pour it on anything and everything. Oh, and you don't have to wait in the regular line with the other saps...just go in the M life \"pearl and above/invited guests\" line...there's never a line and they don't even check your M life card anyway!"}
{"text":"We live in Vegas and quite familiar with all the buffets. The Mirage was always one of our favorites, great Prime Rib, great salad bar and large peeled shrimp. About 6 months ago we noticed the Prime Rib wasn't Prime Rib anymore.  THe carver even admitted that the real Prime Rib days are gone.  We though we'd give it another shot tonight.  We won't ever go back.  They have ditched some food stations to install vending style machines for your now self service beverages,  the table service is gone. I would estimate 1/3 of the food choices are gone,  what remains is marginal,  the Prime Rib still isn't Prime Rib,  but the shrimp are still good ,and still peeled,  . . . for now.  Most of the reviews are from \"the way it used to be\".  Skip this one."}
{"text":"This is my favorite buffet in Vegas. What they lack in diversity they have in quality. Everything is delicious and with your purchase you get unlimited wine. And I don't mean just two different pinots, you actually have a few options. I go with moscato. The only other buffet as good is the bellagio, they have good quality and a diverse menu, but the cravings at mirage has a much better price, plus wine!"}
{"text":"One of the most satisfying buffet choices in Vegas for the money.  At Cravings you don't need to deal with huge lines like you do at Bellagio, Rio, or Aladdin.  The food is fresh, turnover is high, and the price is reasonable.  Advice:  Don't make rookie buffet mistakes!  Walk past all the bread, pasta, and salad choices; the seafood is hidden all the way in the back of the room."}
{"text":"Oaky had dinner here the other night and was really looking forward to it and it was HORRIBLE !! Yea wine and beer were included and bottomless because the wine was likely made yesterday out of some synthetic package - terrible. 

The stations themselves were mediocre at best; ITALIAN looked the best but didn't try any as it was all carbs and way to heaven to eat and the LATIN station was ok with chips/salsa and guacamole, bad canned beans, orange dye color rice, the CARVING station roast beef I have to say was very good, but the frozen crab legs and warm shrimp at the FISHMONGER looked terrible, American was empty when I went to it other than some corn bread muffins and the DESSERTS as wonderful as they looked I saw allot of them in tables with one or two small bites and the rest left. In fact most staff clearing tables were clearing plates still full of food 

I guess maybe two years ago the Christmas brunch was far better that the regular buffet.  

Shame - will not be recommending or returning here."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed at The Mirage this past weekend (3/14-3/16) for our one year wedding anniversary. When we booked, we received two complementary buffet passes. We thought this was great, until we actually sat down to eat...unlimited beer and wine is great if you're a drinker. My husband and I don't drink, meaning that we weren't drunk enough to \"think\" that the food was good. We each tried a variety of things to give it a chance but nothing really stood out as being fantastic! I will say that their bread pudding is tasty but that's about it. I would have been more disappointed if we would have had to pay for it."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Unlimited crab & prime rib& everything is amazing. MUST try in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best buffet I've ever had. There is a large variety of food and its fresh and ready to eat."}
{"text":"This buffet has Coke Freestyle machines.

I have been to this buffet twice (using the Tix4Tonight voucher to get some money off) and I happen to really enjoy it. It has a good spread of options, all of the seating is pretty close to the food, and it has lots of drink choices (which you get to choose yourself). 

There are Coke Freestyle machines here.

When I came this second time with a friend and my girlfriend there was no wait in the mid-afternoon so we were seated immediately and the chow-down began. I wouldn't say this is a high quality food mecca, but it does what it needs to do without asking to be too much.

I like Coke Freestyle machines.

They have a make-your-own Pasta Bar and the usual different stations (Asian, American, Italian, Latin, etc.) as well as the Salad Bar and a nice little cheese and dip (hummus, salsa, etc.) bar. The Dessert area has creme brulee so I was all set there.

Coke Freestyle machines.

I enjoyed my time here."}
{"text":"This place was terrible.  I expected more from this buffet as The Mirage is a decent hotel.  The food was terrible and clearly not fresh.  The \"Noodle\" station consisted of nothing more than dumplings.  The \"Raw Foods\" section had only shrimp and some very old looking crab legs.  For the price, I expected more.  Avoid and go to the Carnegie Deli instead."}
{"text":"Not a great experience   We bought our tickets with the show ticket and got out of the show and they told us they were closing!!  We came directly from the show so this was unexpected.  After my husband jumped up and down, they let us in, but it was very rushed. I always had a good opinion of this buffet, but this was unfortunate"}
{"text":"Decent selection, though nothing too special.  The desserts were excellent, but their \"latin\" food selection was pathetic.  Service was good, the place was pretty clean, but my husband got food poisoning and threw up at 1 am after having our late lunch at Cravings.

I know he won't want to go back again, but it's still a 3 star in my book."}
{"text":"Most definitely an 'ultimate buffet dining experience'. This buffet has everything my little heart could ever desire. The brunch is wonderful, especially with the all- you-can drink Mimosas(hiccup!). HUGE props for  the Mediterranean bar and the lox bagel sandwich bar. Top notch service. C'mon, what is Vegas without a buffet?"}
{"text":"variety of foods i had 3 plates and 1 pho noodle...prime rib were delish very moist and well seasoned, Pho was perfect same taste what i m used to in noVA, their selections are big, not a fan of italian fish cakes but their catfish is flaky good! latin fajitas dish was alright only had small portion of every dish...wish they have more sushi to choose but otherwise well worth it for lunch. I didn't try queen crabs which was a bomber since i was full. This place is also good choice for hangover too :) I did gained 5lb after i left this place"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Lunch is 11-3 and used a coupon from Las Vegas advisor two for one. They had a carving station with ham, turkey and beef tenderloin - so juicy, Italian with pizza and pasta, breakfast items, Mexican with guacamole and fish and latin with mussels, shrimp and clams in tomato sauce. American with okra and quinoa and chicken, sushi - not so good, chine with fried rice and eggplant and chowmein, fried wontons, salad station with fresh salami, salmon and cheese, broad desserts with cakes and donuts and frozen yogurt. Unlimited house wine and beer. Great value!!!!"}
{"text":"Good buffet for the price. There is a good selection of food to choose from. The tri-tip is good and flavorful."}
{"text":"First of all, if you're in a Tix 4 Tonight line wondering whether or not you should buy a discount ticket to the Cravings buffet, I'd advise you to choose another place.  But more about that at the end of my review.

The food itself was nothing to get very excited about.  The high point was the Andouille sausage which had a kick to it and real flavor.  Ironically, the low point was the Cajun chicken, which looked the part but had little flavor and was so dry it was barely edible (and I prefer dry poultry to juicy).  The rest of the food, as many pointed out, was pretty bland, kind of like Golden Corral with less choices.  They do have free alcohol, so if you're more interested in drinking than eating, this may be the place for you.  I don't drink, so this was little consolation for me.

Another Yelper recommended getting a discount coupon.  I had one and came at about 1:00 PM for lunch.  The coupon (from Tix 4 Tonight) listed a lunch price of $11.99.  There were three of us, so I was expecting to pay about $40.  Imagine my shock when the Cashier announced my bill was about $80.  I told her I wanted lunch and she told me they weren't serving lunch \"today.\"  I went ahead and paid and immediately checked their website on my phone only to discover today meant ever.  There is no reference to lunch, only Breakfast, Brunch and Dinner.  Is the Mirage or Tix 4 Tonight to blame for the bait and switch/misrepresentation?  I guess that's a question for the Nevada Attorney General to figure out, I'll update to post any response I get from them.  But given the cashier's slick reply I'm guessing it's the Mirage."}
{"text":"This buffet is really good for the price. Everything I tried was really good. You should also check out the liquor add-on."}
{"text":"Since my last review - Fast forward 7 years - again, I'm sitting at Cravings with the crew. We were tired and didn't want to walk more than a few steps and so this is where we ended up. Learn from mistakes much? No, eh. 

This place is even worse than before. Now they have coffee machines and soda machines like a cafeteria. We went during breakfast so it was just the breakfast spread. Like the cardboard thick dense waffle, typical bacon, blah.

The good thing was the omelette station - but EVERY buffet pretty much has an omelette station. Also they had a pan of egg whites. I had a very egg-heavy breakfast. My friend said there was free alcohol. I didn't think so, but even if there were, I didn't want it in the morning.

The server gave us napkins and took away our dishes like she was doing us a favor. 

Like catching a 2nd movie in a theatre, we could have theoretically stayed into the lunch service since they started to bring out the other foods while we still sat there. But no-thank-you. I would rather not eat than eat more at this buffet."}
{"text":"BREAKFAST BUFFET: 

Good coffee, sweet fruit, and varied selection! This buffet serves delicious options if you pick up the right things. Be careful with the breakfast pastries because not all of them are fresh. I picked up a stale Danish and cut into a rock solid eggs benedict, and wasn't too pleased. When I came across the breakfast goodies most suited to my palate, however, my tongue and tummy were SO happy!

The fresh fruit (grapefruit, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, & pineapple) were sinfully juicy and sweet! I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw the fruit selections were not canned or candied. You could tell they were recently cut straight from the fruits. 

The French toast was soft, fresh, and full of the delicate flavor of sweet spices--either cinnamon or nutmeg. This tasted elegant when topped with cottage cheese and the delicious strawberry compote at the serving station, which was made with strawberries that had a just-picked flavor and wasn't cloyingly sweet. I didn't grab more of anything else because the combination of quality French toast, cottage cheese, and strawberry compote didn't taste cheap and it felt like I was dining at some elegant breakfast spot! 

With a bottomless cup of coffee besides my buffet plate, I'd dine here again any morning."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre, but the price is right! $30 including all you can drink champagne and mimosas, tip included! The benefit of this kind of 3 star place in Vegas is that you can go there with a group of 20+ EDC refugees on a Saturday for lunch and get seated right away.

Our server was so nice and patient with our crazy group that we tipped her extra."}
{"text":"This was, by far, the worst buffet I have ever eaten at. Came on April 13, 2018 with daughter. Not worth $71.46!!! Alot of food was dried out, cold, tasted like freezer burn or refrigerator smell - not pleasant. Nothing tasted remotely fresh or just prepared that day. Awful. Don't waste your $$$. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"$18.99 breakfast. Paid by comps. I came in at 1030am to take advantage of the breakfast and lunch. Nice decor and great layout. Breakfast was standard. They had slice ham and corn beef. Anyways lunch was better. They was serving prime rib! Yes you heard me prime rib!!! Shrimp cocktail. Also is all u can free drinks as in beer and wine. It is self serve drink station. Kind of weird for me since I can't remember the last time i even been to a self serve beverage buffet. 

Here's what i ate....

Hashbrown. Eggs. Sausage. Bacon. Ham. French toast. All the breakfast items was just typical.

Lunch. Various sushi rolls. Had about 6 total variety. The hunan chicken was weak. The pot sticket was decent. The kim chi was just nasty. Overall not bad for asian food selection.

Anyways i think this place is great considering its all u can eat drinks included. I'm not big on buffet but this one is the better buffets. Nothing compares to Bachannal in Ceasars Palace though. The prime rib n sushi itself was worth the 18.99."}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointing, eggs were horrible biscuits were dry as the Sahara desert, brisket I ordered moist was dry, best thing hey had to offer was mimosas, bacon and French toast, I sat for an hour waiting for the server to come over so that I could speak to a manager she never came back safe to say I don't think I could be paid to return to this bit to mention 37.00
Per person and I had to look at a dirty podium"}
{"text":"I come to Vegas every year since 1991 for the National Association of Broadcasters Convention and have developed a tradition of starting it on Sunday with a \"Champagne Brunch\". For many years I did that at the Las Vegas Hilton (now LVH) but this year I had to be at the Mirage for a press event at 2:30 pm so decided to try \"Cravings\" which is the Mirage's buffet. The food selection and quality was excellent and the service was nice and attentive. There is a selection of sushi and dim sum which complements very well the brunch traditional items such as Benedict eggs, pastries, roast beef etc."}
{"text":"Not the best buffet in Vegas, very mediorce at best. Only came here because it was free thanks to myVegas FB app :) 

Here are items that are decent but not spectacular:

1) Prime Rib - this could very well be a hit or miss but when I got it was decent
2) Shrimp - be careful, they served some shrimp that were stilll frozen.. wth.. take them prongs and give them a nice tap to see if it's still frozen
3) Macaroon cookies - surprisingly decent
4) Smoked Salmon - thank goodness they can't screw this one up
5) Crab legs - mediorce, wasn't that good, wasn't that bad

Here are items that were just utter gross and not worth an attempt to eat for next time (if any..)
1) Mussels (mushy mushy mushy)
2) Beef Pho soup (beef chewy chewy, soup bland - no taste)
3) Sushi (gross...)

Since it was free, I okay with not getting my full money's worth to fill myself up on crappy food.

If you want decent buffets, you need to pay up for them or rather line up in order to get seated. This place was pretty deserted. Not worth a 2nd visit, even if it was free. I rather pay for better quality food."}
{"text":"I left so full!  This was a wonderful buffet.  First note, for $2 at one of the discount Tix for Tonight stands that are everywhere on the Strip, you can get a voucher to get the buffet for $11.99 if you go before 3 PM; results in about $10 of savings.  You probably won't get a better price on food and all-you-can-drink in Vegas.  The food was delicious and hot.  There were not a ton of breakfast options (just as a heads up) though the omelette station were you can get it made-to-order was great.  The bar includes Bud Light, Goose Island IPA, and table wine options of Chardonnay, White Zin, Moscato, and a Cabernet.  My particular favorites included the omelette, the chicken tortilla soup, and the sushi; strange mix but it's a buffet!  My boyfriend enjoyed his prime rib from the carving station and got seconds of that."}
{"text":"Alright, so the food here isn't the best in the world... BUT it's not the worst either.

There are actually gems in this buffet... the Singapore fried noodles were amazing (spicy, full of flavor), the prime rib was tender and juicy, and their chocolate cookie was rich and soft.

It's probably one of the better strip buffets (quality to price ratio wise), rivaling Harrah's  casino buffet (the property itself, not the \"King of Buffets\" promo).

I liked it.  I think if I have to go to a strip buffet, this would be a decent pick."}
{"text":"A wide selection of food. Very wide, but nothing exceptional to be honest. The prime rib was great and some of the Asian stuff but other than that largely meh. But the sheer range of the spread, the fact that house wines beer is included in the offering and the lazy pace at which you can enjoy a meal without being interrupted are really nice features of this buffet. Will be back probably just for that."}
{"text":"The hosts and the servers were top notch, almost feel bad they work at a buffet, where sometimes people don't tip. The price was reasonable but on the day I went (Labor Day Monday), between breakfast and lunch, most of my food was cold.  :(  I'm sure if I would have gone to the omelette station, I would have had a better experience.  I do like that you can get your own beverage and while I didn't partake, the beer and wine area is a nice touch."}
{"text":"This should be 3 1/2 stars!  A good buffet, a couple of really good dishes.  But the service holds them back.  We started on journey here on Travelzoo with a $26 voucher for champange brunch - well really champange lunch (11-3, and yes you will wait until 11:00:00 AM sharp, they will count down seconds).  Thursday maybe their most pettty staff.  First impressions are everything aren't they.  After paying our tax of $1.58, we got to see the nicely decorated buffet with everything clearly marked.
We still had choices of some breakfast stuff like bacon, sausage, eggs benedict, and they were still running omelet grill to order your own way.  
Their lunch selection was decent normal suspects Prime rib, turkey, pizza.  Their shimp cocktail were really nice sized.  Avoid shimp cheviche unless you want to taste dill and no shimp.
Okay, good stuff- fried pork won ton, asparagus soup, shimp st louis, tamales, chicken orange, chicken pot stickers, and several nice varieties of salads.. But as usual the dessert table is where this is at..  KEY LIME PIE just get two (three?) pieces right from the start.  Little banana cream pies are quite tasty too.  Coconut macroons were excellent as well.  These are great stand outs here.  
We stayed to drink our money on unlimited champange, and had one really excellent waitress (Rene) and a handful of people who really could care less if we were there.
Good place to eat with a deal!!"}
{"text":"It has been many years since I've eaten at the Mirage Buffet and since it the slow time of the year I thought I would give it a try. Big disappoint and did not live up to my expectations. 

The food selection was just average, not as many choices as I expected and experienced on other buffets. The food taste was blah nothing stood out. The prime rib was all well done, no medium rare. The sushi was terrible, looked like a amateur prepared the selections. The one bright spot was the shrimp are all pealed. You don't have to mess with pealing your own shrimp. 

I don't mean to sound like a snob but all the drinks are self serve. When you go to a buffet I realize you don't have a lot of interaction with the wait staff. However it would be nice to have someone greet you and inquire if they can get you a drink or let the customer know they are there to assist you in any way. Not a single person approached my table during my visit. I felt as though I was at a fast food restaurant. Is saving money on payroll worth the level of service provided to you guest?

When I'm looking at a buffet, I will most likely look else where next time."}
{"text":"We went here on Saturday night in Las Vegas and were sadly seated a good distance from all of the food stations, and on the complete opposite end of the room from the self serve drink station. Was hard to believe with how many empty tables there were closer, all of my food was so so, turkey was great, and the little bit of crab legs left when I got there were very good, but later on when I checked for more, a good 30 minutes, they still hadn't refilled it, unlimited crab legs didn't happen. Neither me nor my fiancé enjoyed the desserts so we were very thankful that we did not pay full price with a coupon we had purchased. Wish they did a cheaper price for those that do not want the unlimited beer and wine as neither of us would have paid for it, my one glass of wine, was very hard to drink and I was not even able to finish it. Our server was very nice but definitely would have preferred to be seated closer to the food and drinks."}
{"text":"This buffet is so so. Certainly not as enticing as the other ones on The Strip.

My boyfriend and I had tried all of the most popular buffets and some not so popular buffets on The Strip. The buffet at Mirage was pretty small and did not have many tasty items. Presentation of the food was just as bland as the food. I only remember the chow mein was good but it was probably the MSG or added sodium. The prime rib was anything but tender and very much overcooked.

Our server however was very kind but I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Got a discount for the buffet from purchasing firstly at the tix4tonight stands. Instead of paying $25, we paid $11.99 and it includes unlimited wine and beer. Food was pretty good but they are doing some construction, so the salad and dessert bar where smashed against eachother. But overall, it was okay if your on a budget."}
{"text":"Cheap price to compare with others buffet in Strip but no much to eat here.  Crab has salt water and no good at all.  No salmon and no much seafood/sushi to choose.  Cheap dessert. No come here again when I'm in Las Vegas, I am rather to go Bellagio buffet, Wynn buffet or Caesar Buffet....etc"}
{"text":"The food was terrible. The free alcohol and $30 price tag does not make up for the lack of quality. I used free comps and was still compelled to write a bad review.....unless cheap frat pizza and toquitos are your thing...avoid!"}
{"text":"Definately a place I would come back for. The have so many options. I loooove this place. Not as much as the buffet @ bellagio. for the price at cravings, its NOT bed at all. 25 max. SF, a nasty asian buffet cost 27.99 a head. plus, its vegas! mussst try!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Vegas for years and pretty much have tried all the big buffets in town....Bacchanal, Wicked Spoon and the Bellagio buffet. I wanted to try something different and one of my friends suggested this place so we went. It's in the Mirage which happened to be a short walk from our hotel we were staying at The Palazzo. As far as the pricing went I didn't see any signs anywhere so I can't remember what we paid. It was roughly around $100 for two adults and two kids. Not bad in my book. There was a nice selection of all types of food labelled by different regions like- American, Asian, Seafood, Mexican etc. I especially enjoyed the crag legs! They made it very easy to eat as they pre-cut them a bit. When I do buffets I do eat a lot but when you just stick to mainly protein and veggies you can get away with it! I sampled a good amount of their desserts and nothing was exceptional and that is to be expected. I did enjoy their lemon cake though! For beverages they had everything you could think of at your disposal even a cappuccino machine! I had one with my desserts and it was creamy and frothy. They even have unlimited wine and beer included in the price which I thought was a great deal if you like alcohol. This is a great mid-priced buffet!"}
{"text":"$35 per person. 

Maybe I expected too much from a Vegas buffet but there were just too many no's about this place. Food was overall just okay (although dessert is a different story). 

Long story short, not much selection of food, everything was way too salty, the stations of food were usually empty, and the line for the seafood section was ridiculously long all the time. 

The only thing worth getting here in my opinion was the italian section (and italian is not my go-to food). The pizza was cheesy and good, and the cheese-filled tortellini and ravioli were amazing. The various types of potatoes available were impressive and all delicious. However, everything else in the buffet was at best mediocre. 

Save some of those calories for dessert - the pumpkin cheesecake, chocolate brownie, and various shooters are all worth getting!"}
{"text":"2 for 2! Our second visit Cravings was just as good as the first. Less expensive than the buffet at Rio and this one includes beer and wine! Love the carving station and crab legs so much, I never have room for much of the many other options, but I still try them, of course.

Sushi here is really good, especially the octopus (went back for seconds and thirds of that). Even the vegetarian rolls I'd never order back home but wouldn't turn down from a buffet was delicious and fresh. 

I'm usually a barbecue snob who skips that section of buffets but I was so happy with everything else that I gave theirs a shot. Helps that their ribs look meaty, unlike the boney offerings I've seen at other buffets. And they were tender and tasty.

Desserts did not disappoint here. We had so many bars, cups, cakes and pies, and they were all awesome. Got lucky with our timing and caught  a great spot for the free volcano show on our way out. Perfect ending to a great dinner.

Will definitely be going back to Cravings."}
{"text":"Okay, so as far as the spread, it's kind of sad.  The layout is confusing as hell, but the most disappointing thing about my visit here was the fact that nothing leaped out at me that was so delicious that I kept eating my hangover away.  I came by here and did the 30 dollar mimosa champagne brunch and I'm sad to say that I literally ate 1 plate of food.  How miserable is that? I also got a mini plate of desserts that I took a half bite out of each of my 4 things and it was really disappointing.  The only thing that saved me was the fact that their asian section had congee (rice porridge) so I was able to keep something down.  Yeah, I was pretty god damned hung over that day.  Me and my friends talked so much shit to each other telling each other and ourselves that we were going to eat a mountain of food and to have at least 3 plates each, if not 5.  What a sad day.  None of us ate much.  30 bucks for a half eaten plate and a half bowl of rice porridge.  But we did clean them out on the mimosas, cause we're boss like that.  (or stupid) 

The food itself wasn't really good and it was actually the worst buffet I've been to in Las Vegas.  I think if you're willing to pay 30 buckaroos for a buffet, I strongly urge you to check out a different joint if you can.  There are far better options out there on the strip that might even be cheaper."}
{"text":"We have been here 4-5 times and we can see this place degrading. The food which used to be very good is now well below average. I can't point to a single item that was above ok. Many dishes were a complete miss (brisket, congele soup, mac n cheese,...). This look like the next duck in the row to get redone."}
{"text":"The buffet was mediocre at best. The only thing saving it from 1 star are the beer and wine. We had plans to meet up with the rest of our group that is staying at the Mirage for our wedding. Little did we know, we would each have to may a mandatory 18% gratuity to be able to sit together since we were a party of 10. 18% gratuity for what!?!? To clear plates? They don't even bring the drinks to you. In fact the man running the place was extremely rude when we questioned the policy. My first plate was mac and cheese and prime rib. The mac and cheese was mush and the prime rib was extremely tough. Sushi was downright gross and italian foods did not look appealing. Desserts were fine although a few tasted stale."}
{"text":"We paid around $72 before tips for 2 on a Sunday night buffet. To be honest I'm a bit disappointed. There's nothing  I find that really stands out or even makes me want to com grab some more. I've tried pretty much everything in here. Most of the food I don't like is because it's too dry. I guess it's been sitting out for a while as it's not quite busy. They do have seafood as well. Cocktail shrimps, Dungeness crab ( hot or cold )... I like the hot crabs but that's pretty much it. 
The only 3 stars only for included unlimited drinks and server was so nice. Do I come back again? Maybe I'll give it another try next time since this time we arrived like an hour before close."}
{"text":"Mike and I came here for dinner and I couldn't shake this feeling of déjà vu. For some reason I was convinced that we had eaten here before, when it was our first time at the Mirage. I was confusing Cravings at the Mirage with the Flavors buffet at Harrahs for some reason. I was very impressed that it was a decent dinner buffet for a decent price. The dessert section let me down a little, but overall I enjoyed Cravings."}
{"text":"We had this one on our last day, as a breakfast buffet.  As this was the last day, this was when we finally mastered the buffet experience, which completly applies to Cravings.  Try everything.  Eat a little.  Don't \"try to get your money's worth\" out of it or else you will leave the table bloated and unable to enjoy the rest of your day.  Just enjoy it for what it is.
This is spoken from a person with buffet experience.
We had the breakfast and I was impressed.  The plantains were insaine (in a good way), the apple crepes rocked my world and the french toast and migas were also amazing.  They had a make your own omlett station in which you did not cook at all but your ordered someone else to make this portion of your meal.  Nice dessert selection, especially for a breakfast, although it is hiding on the other side of the buffet. 
Yum Yum Yum.
Do it."}
{"text":"Good things about the buffet:
1) it's less pricey than most of Strip buffets
2) It's part of Buffet of Buffet list.
3) Have not found any line at 12 pm Sunday

Bad things:
1) Food is not as tasty and fresh as in many other buffets, at least it was worst among 5 Las Vegas buffets we dined in. However you still have a good choice of food there"}
{"text":"I'm glad the hotel gave me credit. This buffet is probably the worst ones I've ever been to. Although it's a \"buffet\" I still had a hard time selecting food. I got 3 small plates with different selection and I can say I didn't like any of them. Chicken was dry and no flavor. Rib was mediocre at best. I tried pizza to play it safe and still nothing. Pizza didn't even taste like pizza.  Only thing that has flavor was our coke soda. We met a couple next to us and they said the same thing....they were disappointed. It took for ever to check in even without a line. I told the cashier we have a room that should be credited. Cashier verified my ID which is fine. But then she had to call front desk to see if I do have credit and took a couple more moments. I understand the verification but they need to change it because guests might think you're calling them a liar. It just seems unorganized.  They should lower the price it's not worth paying $30+ per person."}
{"text":"This review is just for their breakfast buffet. I came here with fellow yelpers Cristal C and Andrew L to finish off our insane week in Vegas for EDC. Sadly I was not really satisfied with this buffet. 

I love Mexican food in the morning, but almost all of their mexican selections here were so overly spiced that I couldn't taste anything else! So, I kindly moved to try their basic American breakfast items... The small waffles were decent, French toast was dry and overdone, and the only thing I felt like going back for seconds was the bacon... 

Oh yeah, they also has an italian section, with pizza.. Pizza? Now that was a little odd to me... I passed on that and peered over at their omelet area. Now that seemed like the winner. That's we're a majority of the people were at, I was already losing my appetite so I didn't actually taste it, but that's where I would suggest someone to try if going here.

They also have a fair selection of bagels, cereals, and muffins, but if you're going to pay 17 dollars for a breakfast buffet, wouldn't you want something at least, hot?? There you go, my 2 cents about the mirage breakfast buffet. Sadly, it wasn't great. I'm definitely moving on to the next one when I go back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Nothing too special about this place. But it wasn't bad. I guess I was expecting a better selection considering it's a vegas buffet. They didn't have a lot of Sunday brunch stuff and their \"Asian food\" section was all Indian. The desserts are pretty good though."}
{"text":"Came here for a 'late brunch' and gahh, it was too good.  Plenty of selections, all were fresh & delish and great staff.  Who puts out vanilla sauce, butterscotch and fudge drizzle for gelato?  Cravings does.  And a giant vat of fresh whipped cream.  I can hear my buttons starting to pop, lol.

But seriously, really great.  BF & I are definitely ranking this as our top 3, with the other 2 being Flamingo & Cosmopolitan (BF likes Aria's chinese selection, but we don't favor it as a whole).

Plenty of seafood selection, and the ceviche was a delightful treat, seeing that I haven't seen that in the other buffets, with a great amount of kick.  Large prawns too for the cocktail, so also a plus.

Service was very good.  No need to ask for refills, he would always come by & check on us.  Didn't wait in line either, luckily enough, since the lunch rush came right after we sat down.

They were constantly putting out new/hot trays, so definitely glad that they're not making giant portions and leaving them out there to sit.  Will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"My family got this deal where we as a family of five ate dinner buffet for like $40 total which was great. Normally it is $40/person, and after eating here I have to say it's probably not worth $40/person.

The food is mediocre. It reminds me of a slightly sophisticated Golden Corral except I think Golden Corral is better value. The Asian food was a bit dry and tasted really Americanized.

My sisters really liked the crab legs. I like how there was a vat of butter just waiting for you.

The desserts were okay. The fruit was sweet. They had mini fruit tarts which I appreciated because I absolutely adore fruit tarts."}
{"text":"The line was a little outraegeous. More an an hour or so. Food was decent. Huge selection: sushi, barbeque, american, dessert, chinese, soups, salads, etc etc
The server took about 12 mins to bring drinks and there were dozens of empty tables despite the hour long line. Def frustrating. 
I've had better in Vegas, for sure."}
{"text":"This buffet is priced pretty much the same as the rest of them, and includes unlimited wine and beer. We picked this buffet because we were staying at the The Mirage, and they also had a better quality beer included in the price. 
There were a lot of options for people without any dietary restrictions. Vegetarians watch out! I talked to the chef and he told me that even the dishes marked as vegetarian contain chicken powder!!! The CHEF told me this! He didn't seem to care at all that this of course makes any vegetarian items not safe for them to eat. I spent the whole night and next day sick from eating chicken, which I am allergic to. This practice of adding meat to items clearly marked as vegetarian is dangerous. Who knows what else is hiding in their food."}
{"text":"We had dinner last night (Friday) and I wasn't impressed. THEY WERE NOT BUSY! The server ONLY busses your table and our server couldn't even do that. You get your own drinks. The desserts were not labeled, so I had no clue what kind of pie I was eating. The crab legs were \"pre-cracked\" and they were dried out. For two adults the cost was $75 total. That DID include wine and beer (beer was warm - not cold) and you go to the bar and get it yourself too. For $75 I expected more. MIRAGE you need to step it up!"}
{"text":"Service...good
Food...good
Prices...decent, mine were great though since I had a coupon from fb"}
{"text":"We ate dinner here before watching Cirque Du Soleil Beatles.  I forgot the price per person but I think it was over $30 a person.  All you can drink beer, wine and champagne.  That is so great!  Either budweiser or Goose Island (not labeled Goose Island though).  This is why I gave it 4 stars.  That's very generous since I really want to give them 2.5 stars.  The food was mediocre.  I ate the usual crab legs.  The only thing I liked was the Nigiri.  The rest of sushi selection sucked.  i wouldn't eat here again unless I wanted to drink beer."}
{"text":"I thought the food was so bland and the variety was like going to Golden Corral. I've had a better buffet with varieties and selections in my town of Colorado, Blackhawk casinos. I will never come back and chose a Resturant instead. Not impressed for a big casino in Vegas -  I expected more. 

Sushi was listed at least 10 but six not even listed. The Italian was 2 main dishes. Yes - the meat was 4 selections. But even the special orders lady wasn't paying much attention to costumes. If it's 8 pm or 830 I'm still paying."}
{"text":"For a buffet this was impressive.  A wide variety of options.  A nice salad bar with a joyous gentleman making your salad for you.  The shrimp and crab tasted fresh and the prime rib wasn't bad either.  If anything needed work, it was the dessert table - I am on vacation and wanted to splurge and my only chocolate option was sugar free chocolate cake?  Wrong answer.  Overall I definitely thought this was a good value for folks with a hearty appetite."}
{"text":"Either this place totally deviated since the last time I dined there or my palette matured greatly.  Anyway, the lack of a long line typical of Sunday  mornings should have been a major red flag.  We had a time constraint so we waited 15 minutes and settled for brunch here at the price of $24.95.  
I'm not sure about the other buffets, but you could also get free mimosas with your brunch here.  

There was a lot of selection with a variety of Chinese, sushi, breakfast, salad, dessert, gelato, and meats.  I avoid all sushi for the most part at buffets, and for good reason, too; my friend decided to try a couple of pieces found the rice to be stale with meager portions of fish.  

Most of the food was mediocre, but the oatmeal was good.  I was also surprised with the har gow and how it tasted like something I could get from Rowland Heights.  I was excited about the gelato case but in the middle of my chocolate gelato, I found a chunk of ice, aka the deal breaker.

I must say that the lady who served our table was very courteous and attentive.  One of the best ones I've ever had at a buffet.  She kicks this review up a star."}
{"text":"Food was terrible compared to other buffets in vegas. Fortunately,  we had a discount cuz there is no way we would pay full price."}
{"text":"First Impressions - this little cafe is tucked in the corner and doesn't leave much to be imagined. But let me assure you that once you get inside you will be delighted with the flavors that follow.

The Spread - the price includes a full selection of beer and wine. If you come on Sunday you can also get all you can drink champagne up to 3 p.m. this is a really fantastic offer considering the prices of everything else in town. My personal favorite is brunch.

The Food - the food here overall is really good. And the variety is amazing. There's everything from prime rib to guacamole. My personal favorite is the dessert bar. My highest recommendations to the bread pudding and the Opera Bar.

The Service - our server was a sweet and cheerful lady. She was attentive without being overbearing. I was very happy to be sitting in her section.

Overall - this is one of my favorite places to eat when I'm in Las Vegas. It's a great place to have brunch or a late breakfast and that'll keep you going until a late dinner. And there is enough variety of food that there is something for everybody. Make your way to this delicious buffet!"}
{"text":"I was here before for brunch and had an amazing time. Food was amazing with tons of options to choose from. When i came back, the food is now ok and no longer amazing. Food options have become smaller. A lot of the food choices were mainly carbs.  I would be back if I knew they went back to their old food options."}
{"text":"Average buffet - but I like that this is one that has unlimited beer and wine - not that I will, but I like that I have the option.  The wine is meh, if you can, stick with the beer.

As of the Christmas break 2016, a whole section was under construction."}
{"text":"IMO, this buffet is average at best. The lines were ridiculously long at The Bacchanal at Caesar's Palace so we walked next door to The Mirage to try out this buffet.

For about $34/person on a Saturday afternoon, the food was nothing spectacular. The price includes unlimited beer and wine, though the selection was also limited. I'm not sure how else I can describe the food except that it was weak af. I was so stoked for the prime rib but even that was drier than the damn Mojave desert I had to drive through to get to this place. Crab legs (steamed and cold) were small but the best part of my meal. The tuna in from their LIMITED sushi selection looked rock hard. Their salad bar didn't have fresh veggies. The fish in their fish n chips were clearly pulled out of a freezer box. It was all-in-all a very disappointing meal.

Two stars for the shorter lines, unlimited beer and wine and cheaper prices in comparison to other buffets on the strip."}
{"text":"The stars are for the food, as it was edible, but nonetheless just okay.  Our service however, was by far the worst I've had in Vegas this trip (which is saying something.) 

We came in at about 1:30 in the afternoon and my mom and step dad ordered a bottle of Champagne. After about 15 minutes, our waiter came by to apologize for the wait, because apparently, the buffet bar was closed; so they would have to go to rEVOLution or Japonais just to get a bottle. Ten more minutes passed by with is wondering why the Cravings bar was closed, when he came back to apologize again for the delay. My mom just said to forget it because she had specifically told the waiter she wanted it with her food.  He stood near our table virtually the whole time we were eating. Normally this would be good, but he was standing there chatting with his coworkers. We barely got refills, I'm glad my coffee came with a carafe. 

In terms of food, it wasn't anything phenomenal. I came here with my fiance last year and remembered the food being better. It seems there were some cut backs at Cravings which is sad, because it used to be one of the best buffets in Vegas. I don't think I will go back to Cravings unless I've exhausted the buffets at Paris, Bellagio, and especially the amazing Spice Market at Planet Hollywood! Sorry Cravings."}
{"text":"We went here to give it a try as we stayed here in the casino. The selection is great and the buffet includes beer and wine as well. For $42 with taxes and tip this place is not worthwhile. It has many selections for food like all the other buffets in Vegas but not yummy or memorable wanting you to come back"}
{"text":"This place is gross.  We were in Vegas with my boyfriend's parents for Thanksgiving (yes, I know this is weird) and my boyfriend's dad really likes buffets.  He is diabetic and likes the variety and that he can find things friendly to his intense diet.  I, on the other hand, do not have such dietary restrictions, and just found this food to be disgusting.  I got a little bit of a few different things (some sort of steak, pizza, corn, a roll, mashed potatoes) and everything was so bland, salty and improperly cooked that I just couldn't do it.  I started getting a headache from the amount of salt in everything.  The desserts were decent and I had a bunch of melon alongside some forgettable but palatable sweets.  I definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Came here to eat on Christmas Eve. Waited an hour and a half to get seated because there was a line (but the restaurant wasn't even full). We paid up front ($36.99/person) and got seated by a hostess. Then you get your food and drinks on your own.  There was a variety of foods from different cultures, but not enough. The dessert section stood out to me the most because they were arranged pretty. They also have froyo. (Peach, raspberry, chocolate, and vanilla)

We didn't have a waitress during that whole time, and I needed a new fork because it was bent but didn't know who to ask.

Overall, I liked the dessert section the most, but everything is consider average"}
{"text":"This buffet was about what I expected from reading reviews prior. The food isn't bad, but it isn't amazing either. I considered it to be pretty average quality. There's 11 different stations with a fair quantity at each. However, me not being able to eat seafood of any kind significantly decreased my options. There's not much at the Latin or dessert stations either in my opinion. I've been to a buffet at a smaller casino in Oklahoma that I considered better than this and it's about $10 cheaper. 

If you're only wanting to spend about $30 for a buffet and you're okay with average quality food with a fair variety then this is the place for you. If not, I would definitely say to splurge on a nicer and higher quality buffet."}
{"text":"I use to love this place, but they keep spiking up the prices on the holidays, $40 a person on a holiday, I suggest you not to come on a holiday weekend. Besides that food is always great, they would get 5 stars from me but their prices keep rising up here"}
{"text":"Great variety, everything I would expect from a Vegas buffet. Did the lunch buffet and got a deal thru tix for tonight- $12/ per person including unlimited wine, beer, mimosas. Had an omelette bar, pizza, breakfast items, sushi, Asian, Latin (guacamole!) carving station, fish, and the biggest variety of desserts! Definitely worth it if you can get the deal."}
{"text":"Convenient, get what you pay for buffet!

Let me start out by pointing out what factors were NOT added into the rating.  These will be talked about at the end of the review:

Beverage service
Other diners / atmosphere
Dining room seating

~~~~~~~~~~~

Buffet is not as pricey as Bellagio, Aria, but more than Circus Circus, Excalibur.  I came for breakfast, which saw a constant flow of patrons; most likely due to this time of year being Spring Break for folks in the country, and the perfect weather to visit for those outside the country.

Food had good taste to it, and is what you expect from a self-service buffet line.  Food sits out for awhile and until mostly empty.  Some buffets will remove the dish, place a new one out, and dump the remains of the first dish onto the new one to give it more of a chance to go through.  This one places new food on top of the existing food so that the bottom of the serving plate likely has food from the start of the morning.  There is a wide selection from what you would normally expect from a breakfast, but key things I noticed was an omelette station, breakfast pizzas, and Nutella pancakes.

The serving space is relatively small and too many times while waiting my turn to a dish, some people would push past me to get further down or to another station.  Some patrons combatted this push past by waking across the dining room floor to get to another station.  Serving area was not as clean as I expected but it was not filthy either.  The only obvious point is that someone does not walk the front side of the stations and wipe spills very often.  When it comes to the ground, spills are cleaned up pretty quickly.

Drinks are self-serve, as is starting to become common with a lot of Las Vegas buffets, most recently noticed at Bellagio.

I was a bit surprised of the waitresses that roam the floors.  Normally, they would come around and refill drinks.  Since Mirage's buffet has self-serve stations, this duty was eliminated.  There was no one that came by during my experience to ask how things were going.  I did notice waitresses walk around constantly, but some are preoccupied talking to other co-workers to talk to the diners.  Also, they peer over your shoulder and keep walking.  I saw this with about 5 of the waitresses walking the dining room grounds.  None of them said a word to a diner unless they needed something, like silverware or napkins.

All in all, you get what you pay for.  The quality is better than half of the Strip's buffets, but it does have their downsides.  I do intend to visit for a dinner to see how the experience may differ.

~~~~~~~~~~~

Factors to Discuss (Not part of rating)

This buffet does have what seems to be a full service bar!  Beer, wine, cocktails, hard liquor all seen.

I was put off by one person's act of reaching in and grabbing food with her hand because she didn't see the serving spoon on the holder dish 2\" away.  I did tell a staff member, who was very quick to replace it with a fresh set of food and even a new serving spoon and holder dish.  This was a nice gesture and it makes me wonder if this always is the case both here and at other locations.

A warning:  dining room floor is fairly cramped.  Tables are put closer together with other tables that make navigating the floors a bit daunting due to the close proximity to other tables and diners.  A few times I was brushed accidentally by other diners or staff.  However, I chose not to include this in the rating because as expected, the buffets want to get as many people in and out as possible, and I can understand the logic behind this.  The tables are strategically placed in a cross-diagonal pattern instead of checkerboard so you have less of a chance to bump directly into some other diner's back when scooting your chair out."}
{"text":"We keep coming back to this place! Everything you need is right there! If I can rate this place I'll give them a 1000.00% love this restaurant, veronica, the Sheff , the manager Steve, and everyone is doing perfect thanks to mirage hotel for your time!"}
{"text":"This review is for the midweek breakfast/brunch.  We stayed at the Mirage, so the brunch buffet here was convenient.  Unfortunately, even though every day is a weekend in Vegas, it isn't at Cravings.  We missed out on the unlimited champagne that they offer on the weekends.  

As far as food goes - they had pretty much everything.  Everything but crepes that is.  The food was okay, but nothing that I have to have again.  In addition to standard breakfast staples, they also had a Mexican section, eggs Benedict, a omelet station and plenty of pastries.  

We were semi-attended by a server who provided us with beverages and to clear away extra plates. 

Nothing special."}
{"text":"For the breakfast (not Sunday Brunch) buffet:

Pretty standard fare, and not worth $17 for breakfast, unless you are really famished or have teenage boys that will take advantage of the situation. I would have preferred an omelet at a sit down restaurant.

The omelet station was okay, at least something was freshly cooked. The waffles were not crisp and tasted like cardboard,  the french toast was okay, and the pre-cooked eggs tasted like powdered egg crap (which is typical at buffets). 

I thought about giving them a second chance for dinner, based on Yelp reviews, but my brain and taste buds dictate that if I'm at the Mirage for dinner, I'm going to Kokomo's."}
{"text":"Brunch for $18.50. The food, especially is Crab Leg and Shrimp, will worth the price. The salad bar is awesome thought I haven't try. Just go to the RAW BAR and have the crab and shrimp!!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice brunch selection. $6 more for unlimited mimosas so that is nice. However, the wait staff was not attentive at all which made the gap between mimosas seem like forever and almost not worth it."}
{"text":"Food: 3 - 3.5 stars
Price: 4.5 stars
Ambiance: 1.5 star

We came here for brunch. At $18.50 (w/o alcohol), this felt like a bargain. A few days in Las Vegas and I think $20 for brunch is a steal. Phew~ I gotta get out of here fast.

Well, this buffet actually was a pretty good deal, even though the quality of food varied widely.

The crab legs and shrimps at the raw bar were fresh and tasty. In fact, this is mostly what my husband ate. Go for the seafood and get your money's worth. :)

The sushi looked terrible, so I didn't bother grabbing any. The rice looked mushed up, dry, and stale. Gross.

Hot seafood section was alright. I had a bite of the halibut, which was ok. A bit overcooked but not too bad. 

The omelet station was fun. You pick your ingredients, and a friendly cook will prepare it before your eyes. 

The breakfast section is blah. Pancakes and french toasts were tasteless. 

The salad bar was also fun. You pick whatever you want and they mix them up for you.

They also offered 2 kinds of meats (ham and prime rib) at the carving station. I believe there were also the Chinese section where they had below average dim sum and Latin section to which I didn't pay much attention.

The highlight of my meal was the crepe. The peach crepe was heavenly. I would go back just for the crepe. So soft, creamy, sweet but not overly sweet. mmmmmmmmmmmm ~~~~~~~

I am not a doughnut fan, but i was very impressed by it. It tasted very light and fresh, nothing like a gas station doughnut. 

I am pleased with the brunch. If you want to drink, you pay 5 or 6 dollars more for unlimited champagne or bloody mary."}
{"text":"Another once legendary buffet in Vegas.  This buffet is in need of a makeover, once a jewel in Vegas it now looks outdated to me. There are still a few gems in the food selections kobe beef being one of them, but there are far better buffets to gorge your bellies at."}
{"text":"They got crepes!!!! That's why I came. Big selection of food from Italian, to Japanese, Mexican and a few others. All very good.  I couldn't wait to hit the dessert section but once I got there I was disappointed :( They only had peach crepes but the guy suggested I get a plain one and then go add my own strawberries and whip cream from the ice cream section. I did but it was not the same. BOOO!!!! 
Price $18.50. Very nice and clean place. Service was ok."}
{"text":"Dinner buffet. Quality of food was just OK.  Preparation of the food was sub par and about 30% of the food was almost inedible, especially the desserts.   Beverages like coffee and juice vended out of machines into plastic cups is just cheesy.    Spice Market at Planet Hollywood is much much better for the same price.  This is NOT a premium buffet."}
{"text":"Upper Management should reconsider their decision to put Aileen in management at the restaurant. She didn't know policies when it came to any questions for coupons/discounts at the buffet. She was super unhelpful. Ruby (I believe that was her name) was the only person who had any knowledge. Unlimited drinks included with the buffet was nice, but might rethink this buffet."}
{"text":"The weekday dinner price is $29.99. The line is very short at 7:00pm.  I used to come here before this place got remodeled so I expect it must be better after remodeling.  The first thing I know is I have to get my own drink which is the other end where I sit.  No server for drink like before.  Only bus boys to take your dishes.  Be prepared if you have small children and you have to serve them drinks.  The Asian food section is more than half empty.   For over one hour I kept checking on BBQ Pork Bun and Seafood bun but they did not get refill.  The chef was very busy with his wok.  Every section has only one chef so the refill is very slow.  The wonton and noodle is ready to serve in the pot.  It used to be prepared by the chef for your order so it's very fresh.  The American food section offers like five items but no fries.  BBQ ribs is hard and dry.  The corn is very good.  I got to say the only good item I like is corn that night.  Buffalo wing is ok but very spicy.  The Carving section offers very well done prime rib so I came back later for a medium slice.  The well done part is falling apart so I hear the other guests asked if it was pull pork.  Prime rib has no taste.  I cannot taste the spices from the rub at all.  Seafood section offers crab legs and cocktail shrimp.  Salad bar and cold item have a good selection.  They also have the Latino food section.  Beside pizzas there is Chef's Kitchen for Italian food but I found no menu for you to order which dishes you want.  I saw the pasta dish that the chef was cooking.  It came in big portion that I'm sure I cannot finish that.  There are vanilla yogurt, chocolate yogurt, raspberry sorbet and peach sorbet at Gelato section.   The dessert section needs to get updated on the menu and the décor.  The watermelon is cut with dice shape so they get smashed up with the serving spoon.  The watermelon should be sliced and use tongs to serve.  It should not be an issue to get drinks if you do not have children or sitting too far from the soda station.  For the same price, you can go to other buffet like Aria that offers more variety of foods, dessert and gelato and has server.  I noticed that not a lot people left tips for the bus boy who cleared the heavy dishes but I tipped him anyway for his hard work.  For the variety and quality of food and speed of refilling food, I would not recommend to others."}
{"text":"My husband and I were staying at the mirage. We went to check out the buffet and it was a disappointing experience. We got a 30% off from ticket4tonight so ended up paying $25 + taxes. It wasn't worth it. Little selection, mediocre quality with cheap wine and beer. Only good thing was our waitress who came to our table often."}
{"text":"came here for my first buffet in vegas.  it was mediocre, not much selection as many stations were empty.  ie: the latin food only consisted of guacamole and salsa.  the prime rib there was pretty good though.  but all in all, not much selection."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Used myvegas reward 2 for 1 brunch buffet. Cost about $37 on a Saturday. Then they handed a coupon for another 2for1 buffet deal for next visit. Immediately our server gave us mimosas. Well that gave me a good buzz and they just keep pouring it! Awesome  servers! Glad I read the yelp review and went to this place for buffet. Food is average. Im easy to please. They have all the selections that I love.  Cant go wrong if you pick this place."}
{"text":"Meh. I tried this buffet after being blown away by the buffet at Bellagio, and was mildly disappointed after visiting this one. 

The staff was friendly and attentive but we had to get our own drinks. I liked that Bellagio brought them to the table. Also, the free wine that comes with the meal is awful. The Chardonnay was bitter and super dry instead of smooth and buttery, which is what I like, personally, in a Chardonnay. I opted for Sprite Zero after a sip or two. 

The assortment of food was kind of... Off. Nothing really matches. The barbecue section had not one item with BBQ sauce and no grilled items; it consisted of hot wings, cabbage and nothing else I would see at a BBQ joint down south.  The Latin section had quail, tortilla chips and potatoes.  As I walked around it was hard to decide what to build my meal out of because it was all so random. 

The good: prime rib was juicy, shumai was scrumptious. 
The bad: The broccoli stir fry in the Chinese section was bitter and greasy. Wine selection was awful. 
The ugly: The creme brûlée was liquidy and the sugar on top was not at all crispy-- it had the consistency of flan. The pizza dough wasn't cut all the way through and it was pretty gross watching people pull it apart with their hands, leaving pieces they touched behind. 

My advice- go to Bellagio instead. So much better!!"}
{"text":"We have a MyVegas reward for dinner. 

The free wine were nice but we didnt take full advantage because we had to get to a show. The best thing, in my opinion, on the dinner buffet was the mac n cheese. I tried a few things I wasnt crazy about and went back for more mac n cheese."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. The food was cold and the variety you would expect for a buffet was mediocre. Even the dessert station was seriously lacking. For 38 dollars a person I could have had a way better meal somewhere else. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"A great wide variety buffet! They have unlimited wine and beer for no extra charge! Wish I would've known before my last day there. The staff was very friendly! I would recommend for a nice brunch!"}
{"text":"You definitely get your money's worth (32$) if you drink and eat as there is unlimited beer and wine, and the selection is actually pretty good. The food was hot and fresh. Our favorites included the pizza, spring rolls, guacamole and fresh steamed crab legs with butter. Yum!"}
{"text":"great brunch. The Chinese entrees are the best. The omelette station was also very good. Happy with the drink selection as well. The desserts were amazing. Worth the money"}
{"text":"Located in the back of the Mirage, close to Samba, this is a fairly spacious buffet. They also have a to-go option: $16 for a box.

BF wanted something fairly quick and everything else in the casino would've had a long wait. Came on a Sunday (3/1/2015) around 11AM and there was no line (that should've been our first indicator about this place).

Note: Drinks are SELF-SERVE!! So if you're going to pre-tip at the cashier, I wouldn't tip very much since they hardly stop by to clear the tables or re-fill any alcoholic beverages you may have ordered.

Beer, Wine & Mimosas included during brunch.

Waffles were soggy but the french toast was pretty good (lots of cinnamon). There's a chef station that does custom omelettes but the line was too long. There's also different pizzas next to the chef station if you want pizza for brunch.

Tried the potsticker and seafood bun. The bun was really gross and mushy, but the filling was ok. Potsticker tasted like the frozen kind. Fried wonton was mostly oil and almost no filling.

The chilled shrimp and king crab legs were decent. The cioppino was probably the tastiest thing there but the bread that supposed to go with it was very stale (avoid it). Stayed away from all the sushi and sashimi since they all looked old and rubbery.

There's a carving station where the carver kind of creeped me out. He kept staring at me while he was cutting the prime rib that I ordered -_-|| The meat was fairly tender and juicy, but not much flavor.

The desserts didn't look too appealing: very dry-looking. The creme brulee tasted boxed and the panna cotta tasted like a pudding cup. I found it very weird that the \"sorbet\" is dispensed out of a soft serve machine. The toppings are around the corner of the machine.

Service is pretty much non-existent which sucks since my BF gave a good pre-tip. Lucky we were seated at a 4 person table even though we were only a pair because we just left our dirty dishes on the empty table (which got piled high). If you want a refill on your mimosas or beer, just get up and go to the counter yourself (otherwise you'll never get another drink).

If you have a voucher or a discount to come here, try it out.. But do NOT come here if you have to pay full price. Definitely not worth it at all. Our friends had a free voucher and they thought the buffet was really bad. Imagine how we felt since we paid for ours =/"}
{"text":"Really expensive but then again which buffet on Vegas isn't.  That being said one of the better ones I had. 

We were there at around 330 pm so one might expect the food to be stale.  

Good stuff
Oslo Busco.  
Seafood bollingase(can't spell it)
Beef ribs both Asian and BBQ. 
Deserts 
5 dollar pitcher of bud light 

Things to stay away from. 
Sushi
Hush puppies"}
{"text":"Nice and clean. The staff was nice. The food was what you expext from most Las Vegas buffets. So nothing was great but nothing was bad.
I would eat here again if i happen to be near by and hungry."}

{"text":"Granted, I have never experienced what's offered at the buffets at Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, or some of the other spots along the strip, but I imagine it can't be much different than Cravings, here at the Mirage.  Here's everything you could possibly dream about in a buffet, all for under $20.00 at lunch.  Fresh seafood, piping-hot selections from the Asian, Mexican, Italian, and other food stations, while the decor creates a truly stunning atmosphere.  Modern, fresh, and delicious."}
{"text":"We found a coupon at travelzoo.com for $40 for 2 people, all you can eat and all you can drink beer/wine. Although the buffet is huge, meaning the buffet food is all the way around the dining tables, I was less than impressed at the quality of the food.

The top sirloin was dry (I like medium rare and juicy), they did not have any hot shrimp dishes only cold, plan shrimp and some shrimp cocktails, the king crab was split in half which was nice, but it was very much 'frozen food' tasting and super salty not at all fresh tasting, and they only had 1 dim sum item (pork 'meatballs' called shumai, which were just okay). Staff was friendly. Don't go at normal eating times, as the line was really long to get in.

Keep in mind, I'm not that picky of a person. I like value more than anything, so for $20 per person, I'm not complaining much, except that I think that there are better buffets in the area for a lower price. I certainly wouldn't pay the normal $40+ that it would have cost w/out the coupon. We went to FLAVORS Buffet the next day, and I was much more impressed with the quality of the food. They had an excellent breakfast buffet for $14 or so."}
{"text":"For $35/per person you should not have to wait 45 minutes due ill prepared for a large party. The service level and food is sub par  for the price. A simple there will be a wait at time of payment would have went a long way. We will not be back!!!#"}
{"text":"Not a mere meal, an event.  At least if you eat (and drink) like I do, it is.  
\"Buffet, meet Jessica.\"  *buffet runs away screaming*

I can safely say that this is my favorite buffet for champagne brunch in Vegas.  I have now been here three out of the last three times I have been in Vegas and plan to make it four out of four whenever my next Vegas adventure may be.  The mimosas are truly bottomless, and the service is friendly and attentive.   I love that they're open on Saturdays as well as Sundays and especially that brunch runs until 3pm (because let's face it an \"early start\" is anytime before noon in Vegas time).

The crab legs never run out.  They have a beautifully fresh and bountiful seafood section that overflows with an abundance of various shellfish, as well as a tasty selection of hot seafood dishes.   This is what stole my heart and kept me coming back.   

I love that they have a wide variety of international cuisines to choose from, with plenty of emphasis on the Asian styles (my favorites!) including sushi, dim sum, assorted pho and ramen soups, Thai, Chinese, and the like.   I tried my first (good) Ramen here, and that is the bowl that first sold me on it as a legitimate cuisine.   There is also a selection of Mexican, Italian, Indian, Mediterranean, and so many other types of food I can't even think of them all.   They also have a nice array more common american-ish foods here including a rotisserie (serving prime rib and other meats), fried everything, any side dish I can ever remember having on my parents' dinner table, a salad bar, and all breakfast-y  foods imaginable including an omelette bar and waffle station. 

And then there's dessert.  (If you have any hidden nook in your tummy that is not stuffed full at this point.)   A decadent assortment of chocolate and baked everything.  Cue sugar coma. 

Keep in mind that it *is* a buffet so you are not going to get sushi that is equal to the best sushi restaurant you've ever eaten at or prime rib as good as the Michelin joint up the street ...  but considering how (comparatively) little you are paying the selection, sheer volume, and the fun experience make up for that in my opinion.  I don't consider this my 'fine dining' experience of the weekend... it's more of the 'lets see how many mimosas and crab legs we can shove in our faces in 2 hours then walk around Vegas all drunk-and-full-like for the next few hours' way to start your day/weekend.   For that, I will keep coming back until the mimosas stop flowing."}
{"text":"The other reviews are right on target in regards to the ambiance being bland but the food is great for a buffet!  If you decide to do a buffet for dinner, this is the BEST!  They have an endless amount of options to please everyone.

I started off with sushi, had seafood (yay for crab legs!) as my main course, beer and wine was included in the price, and they had lots of desert options.  This definitely isn't a fine dining experience but it's in a great hotel in an awesome location on the strip and they definitely don't cheat you on the buffet menu.  I can't think of one type of food that wasn't represented!

Make sure you come here hungry and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Though not by any means a Vegas buffet expert, I believe the quality of the buffets on the Strip are priced accordingly.  Cravings is a low-to-mid level priced buffet.  The big attraction for me was that unlimited beer (and wine) was included in the price.

The majority of the food -- and I sampled a LOT -- was above average.  I didn't care for the crab legs, and the mac and cheese was terrible.  So avoid those.

High marks go to the carving stations.  Prime rib, sausage, corned beef -- all fantastic.  I wish I would have stopped there first; it was truly the highlight of the buffet.

Three and a half stars, rounded up to four."}
{"text":"I like this place better than the Excalibur or Luxor buffet BY A LONG SHOT! Here's WHY..
- You can grab your own drinks
- wait staff & servers are friendly
- the salad bar is cook to order no kids touching the salad
- cook to order omelettes are okay
- their french toast is good but both times i went I managed to grab the soggy slices left over, still thought they were amazing just wished they were better quality.
- not too expensive as long as you 1) use myVEGAS or a hard comp from the M life desk 2) if your nice to the wait staff you might get BOGO cards 


5/5"}
{"text":"Now the only reason my bf and I made it a point to eat here during one of our visits was because Cravings was voted one of the best buffets in LV!  My experience here was not what I expected.  After being a loyal customer at the Buffet @ Bellagio, I expected greatness after being named one of the top buffets on the strip.  What I CAN say about this place is that they have the best asian food I've tasted from international buffets such as cravings.  They had wonton soup, a beef noodle soup, and spring rolls!  I've never seen these options on a strip buffet so I was impressed.  The quality was good tho not as good as authentic asian food of course.  But their asian options by far exceeded other buffets of its kind.  The dessert selection was great.  Loved the gelato and the macaroons!!  I couldn't stop myself from getting seconds and thirds.  

The prime rib was inconsistent.  Some slices were good and others were dry and unappetizing.  I think that the food here is solid and gives you a diversity of dishes that you don't find at other buffets on the strip.  I will applaud them for attempting to satisfy any \"cravings\" you may have be it pizza or sashimi. This place is decently priced for lunch and so if you are in the area and are starving this would be a viable option for you and your group."}
{"text":"Good dinner! Service was good however good was average.  Great selection of Chinese and oriental options. Some good items included prime rib, turkey, seaweed salad, tomatoes and mozzarella! Some not so good included lobster bisque, deviled eggs and cold crab legs! Definitely would eat here again however will probably just try some other buffets! We got a travelzoo two for one so it was definitely worth it for us!!"}
{"text":"Really good buffet, with a carving section, where a chef is carving prime rib, roast turkey and salmon - which tasted awesome.

Unlimited beer, wine and soft drinks, without having to wait, for the waiter to get down to your table and serve it. 

Remember to buy food tickets at Tix4tonight, as you get 30%.

Only thing to \"complain\" about, was the desert section... It all looked good, but could have been better."}
{"text":"It's clean, large selection, friendly service. The food is average, nothing spectacular. I think that the way the food is displayed and the lay out of the buffet is what makes it pretty appealing. I think the Paris buffet is still better (although I did not get to try the Paris buffet on this trip). The selection of food at Cravings is mostly dishes to make you full and not so much satisfied. The snow crab legs looked great until you start eating it and realize it's just frozen crab legs. Dinner cost us $35pp."}
{"text":"I came back here again a couple weekends again, and once again it did not disappoint. Only problem was it was 35 bucks for dinner since it was their \"holiday menu\". Aside the price, the food was amazing. I think its one of the first Vegas buffets I've been to where they actually served steak. Of course I had to enjoy the sushi, crab legs, etc. etc. and the gelato ice cream. Service for drinks and removing plates was pretty good too. 

I guess I can say its my favorite buffet now."}
{"text":"getting our trip to Vegas delayed by almost 2 hours thanks to Snowpocalypse 2010 meant that we were mad hungry upon arrival, so a bunch of us hit the buffet at Mirage.

there's a ton of variety, which is a plus. my friends warned me about the crab legs, so I avoided those. the beef pho was alright, the steamed pork buns and the carved meats were good, the ribs were great, and the Mexican station was really good. 

dinner will run you $28. there's better buffets in town, but Cravings isn't a horrible one to lose a belt notch to."}
{"text":"The price for midweek brunch is $23.99 but if you have a military ID, you get 20% off! I can say it's just fair price with the food they have. There's plenty of good choices. The cappuccino is awesome! I love their mirage pudding with creamy vanilla sauce! Not a bad choice for a brunch buffet, we're happy :-)"}
{"text":"I'm kinda disappointed with the quality of food here. It was good long before. Price was up ($30.99/per + tax) while food quality was down. That's not a good sign. I tried Prime Rib which was good, but broccoli was very chewy. Seafood bouillabaisse tasted OK, but toast bread tasted old and stale. Although it has other types of Mexican, Italian, Japanese and Chinese food, but, they were all looked unappealing to me. Crab legs and shrimps cocktail were small, rock crab claws were quite tasty, however. You can find this kind of seafood at cheap Chinese buffet restaurants. Croissant was dried and hard... Dessert bar had poor choices compare to other places. The positive things that I can think of is beer and wine are included and service was good. Won't come back and won't recommended to anyone."}
{"text":"The scrambled eggs were pretty nasty and looked like curdled cheese. Also, the juice machine was extremely watery because they forgot to refill the concentrate. However the French toast was pretty good and they had corned beef."}
{"text":"What a letdown and disappointment.  For the price paid ($35) and the QUALITY of items available it is below the standards of others on the strip and in Henderson.  

I took a family of 4 during breakfast hours and nobody was impressed.  This used to be better in years past.

I unfortunately can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Now, I'm sorry that I'm giving you two stars but I'd give you three stars if I ever decided to come here again. 

It's a decent Las Vegas buffet. They did have some good dishes but then they did have some NOT so good dishes. The snow crab legs were a bit too salty for my liking. The prime rib and sweet potato mash was my favorite there.

The desserts were alright. I grabbed a bunch but didn't really like them. Sorry. They were just plain.

I don't really have much more to say about Cravings. :o/"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the more mediocre buffets in the strip resorts (for the price).
You're unlikely to be bowled over by the selection, or find anything new and exciting.

On the plus side, getting wine from the bar was pretty fast and efficient.

Theres the typical line of buffet foods from each region: Mexican, Italian, Southern, American etc. With the very stereotypical dishes that people think actually come from those regions..

The seats were very uncomfortable... most likely to prevent hordes of the obese from settinling in and eating for the entire dinner or lunch periods. I sort of get that, but most people don't spend hour after hour grazing the buffet, so why should they have to sit uncomfortably?

Bonus points for not having long lines at the different buffet stands.. though I wonder whether that isn't for good reason."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. I ate here on Friday night (3 days ago) after we checked into our room from traveling all day. It was pricey (over $60.00 for 2) and the food is typical low quality buffet food.. overcooked and tasteless. The crab legs on the day we ate were NOT king crab and to add; they were rubbery! The only reason I gave 2 stars is because of the unlimited beer and wine & there is a huge variety of options. It was also clean and upkept. Had the food been better quality, I would have rated higher."}
{"text":"It's pretty good.

We have dined here a few times.

Service ia usually really good.

Not A Lot Of Option, But Enough.

My favorite is Prime Rib, then the crab legs that are already cut in half.

Unlimited Bud Light or Goose Island IPA or some wine (not sure what kind because we aren't wine drinkers).

They have a $20 1 time, take out option. That I haven't seen at any other buffet."}
{"text":"Ok. I've never been to a Buffett in Las Vegas. We happened upon this little gem. I'm quite happy. $33 a person, unlimited alcohol, great food, yum!"}
{"text":"I've only had dinner here with my family but we all loved it.
It is convenient how they label each section so we know exactly where to go to get seafood, salads, Chinese, Italian, etc.

The price was decent, it costed us way less than the teppanyaki at Benihanas we had the night before, haha.

I loved their variety of foods.
The waiter was extra nice."}
{"text":"Considering how I've felt about buffets, this place wasn't half bad.  I still couldn't imagine giving more than 3 stars to any buffet (unless they were just out-of-this-world-effing-fantastic) so I think this place was pretty decent as far as buffets go.  

$25 was a reasonable price for offerings of crab legs, sushi, prime rib, chicken, etc galore.  I didn't try any dishes with beef or chicken, so my review is slightly biased. 

Pros:
Attentive service
Delicious grilled orange roughy, mussels and cioppino
Wide array of different dishes, including Asian, Mediterranean, American, and Italian
Salad bar with great offerings and freshly tossed just for you
GELATO!!!  OMG delicious!

Cons:
Crab legs were a bit salty so I was disappointed that I couldn't gorge on them like I wanted to
Dessert variety was wide, but not very good

I know I've complained about buffets before, but this place was pretty a-ok.  I'm sure it's not the best and certainly not the worst offered on the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"I was at an all weekend seminar in the Mirage and asked friends who had come with me to vegas to meet me there so I could have lunch with them (on a sunday).
I was disappointed that the price is the same with or without champagne (at Bellagio, it's a few dollars less if you're not drinking, which I wasn't since I was in a class...)
But there was NO LINE!!!! I though the selection wasn't AS huge as Bellagio but the food was all good! And it's very spacious and not crowded. 
I would recommend skipping on the sushi rolls.  The salad bar looked amazing and I wish I'd discovered just how amazing it looked before I was already stuffed. The crepe station was fantastic with plain or peach crepes and plenty of sauces for them. Prime rib was excellent. Belgian waffles with maple butter and whipped cream were simple but oh so tasty. Loved the chilaquiles and chimichurri sauce, the croissant bread pudding was wonderful, the poached apples were delicious.. oh my, I'm getting hungry :)


I had to get back to my class, but my friends told me that they sat there for 3+hours drinking champagne and received excellent service. 

Definitely would visit again!"}
{"text":"Visited March 2013

My husband & I got a coupon from Travel Zoo for here & decided to try it. I had been here one other time & was very happy so I was praying that things had not changed. We were both very impressed with the food. Both the selection & flavor of everything was excellent! We went for brunch on a Saturday, it was busy but not too busy. We did not have to wait for a table. For brunch they offer a good selection of breakfast foods, lunch foods & deserts."}
{"text":"We ate here for breakfast one morning because we had free passes due to booking at the Mirage. It was easy enough to stop by and use those passes one morning. We were seated quickly in this HUGE restaurant. We were offered juice and coffee, included in the buffet. Then we went around to look. We didn't even realize til we sat down that there was an entire other side with even more food. They have EVERYTHING here. Every breakfast food known to man, plus salad, asian food, Mexican food for breakfast burritos, lots of pastries, desserts and more. I had oatmeal, fruit, hash browns, and a cinnamon roll. It was fine. Other mornings, we paid the same amount or less for higher quality food and more manageable portions. I'm just not a buffet person..."}
{"text":"This is my second visit here, and it didn't disappoint. It's got the typical buffet offering such as prime rib roast & snow crab legs hot & cold. But what sets the buffet apart from most others is the unlimited beer & wine! Although your choices are limited but I'm sure you can find beer & wine of your liking. The buffet does not have an overwhelming array of food dishes and the room is kind of small compared to other strip buffets, but its not cramped or crowded & the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"There are alot better buffets than this one.  Course there are also pricier buffets too.  So it is tough to compare.   First off the prime rib was definitely good and I do love my prime rib  ( but I didn't see anything else like turkey or ham at the carving station for all the non prime rib fans, didn't bother me as much but just saying).  Next if you truly enjoy sushi, never eat it at a regular Vegas buffet because it just isnt that good (excluding Rio and Bellagio buffets) so I won't fault Mirage really for that.  The shrimp cocktail and crab legs were as good as most other buffets.  They're Chinese food was not very good along with alot of their sides like potato salad, mashed potatoes, and other veggies etc.  And while they do have gelato, their selection is quite small, (4 flavors of which the hazelnut was the best), the other desserts did pretty much suck. The cheesecake was incredibly gross along with a not so good apple pie.  And since we all know dessert is pretty much the best part of a meal, that definitely didn't leave the best taste in my mouth.   Overall for 25 dollars a person, it was decent, but I'd rather spend the extra money to eat better."}
{"text":"Their Breakfast Buffet was great. I was expecting it to really suck. But it didn't. 

All tables got orange juice, if you want cold milk you get it, coffee & tea.
I loved their omelette station, I was able to pick whatever I wanted with it!
My baby loved the choice of bread and I liked how we could toast them right there. I do wish that they had more people manning that station though because it sucks that I had to wait for quite a while.

We didnt even get through half of it until we were totally full. I didnt go back because of the price,  its cheaper for me to go to Bouchon and get something because my husband and I eat so little.

I guess its great, if the price was lower (maybe like $10) I would be here all the time. At least the hotel should give a discount for people renting rooms there. I stayed at the Mirage for 5 days and they didnt give me anything.

Their pastries and desserts sucked though. Didnt like them at all."}
{"text":"Cost: $20.48 for the lunch buffet (tax included)

They have a huge selection of food, but everything looked so unappetizing. Everything looked cold and stale. I picked up some sweet potato fries, a piece of catfish, mahi mahi, a bowl of wonton noodle soup, a vegetable spring roll, and a bowl of chicken congee. I broke my personal rule of not eating Asian food at an American buffet once again, but after two nights of partying in Vegas, I was desperately craving for something Chinese. The chicken congee really hit the spot. Way too salty, but it was comfort food. The wonton noodle soup was okay. The MSG soup was a nice cure for my semi-hangover, but the wonton filling had a mushy, pasty texture which I didn't like. Everything else was pretty bad. Tasted exactly as it looked... uninviting."}
{"text":"if i could, i would give it more stars. such an amazing selection of food from italian, japanese, chinese, and seafoods.

they make your salad fresh and prepare it for you, great soup and shrimp shrimp shrimp.

the champagne brunch, which serves the same food as dinner but with eggs, waffles, the works, is only $22. not bad for what you're getting and all you can drink mimosas or champagne. though i think the price of the brunch is higher on sundays, it's still such a great deal."}
{"text":"After a truly dreadful experience at the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace last night (Voted best buffet? By whom? A bunch of drunks?), I was delighted to have just the opposite experience tonight at Cravings! Seriously...from start to finish, it was like night and day!

To begin with, the first thing we noticed as we walked in (other than the fact that we WERE able to walk right in) was that everything smelled and looked incredibly appetizing (a real contrast to Bacchanal's rancid-smelling steam tables!). A quick turn around the stations (which are organized in a neat oval, so you can easily see what's available) showed that there was plenty available for us to eat (we're vegetarians, and my husband has a seafood allergy, so we're a little pickier than a lot of buffet diners).

Most importantly, everything was beautifully fresh, clearly labeled, and nicely presented. Again, after our experience of wilted greens, dried-out rice and bread, and tasteless pizza the night before, the contrast was striking. This looked and smelled, from the get-go, like stuff we really WANTED to eat rather than something we were settling for.

Another important point: When I asked the people at the stations what was in this dish or that, they KNEW, without having to scratch their heads, mutter \"I dunno\" and go find someone else (yes, we had that experience at Bacchanal as well).

Everything I had was delicious (and it was quite a mixture...ranging from vegetable spring rolls from the Chinese station to beautiful Arab-style hummus, tabouli, and FRESH, SOFT pita from the Mediterranean station). I was especially impressed by the range of cheeses in the deli section. Sage Derby! Guinness-laced Irish Cheddar! Yum!

Just because, I sampled the pizza as well, and again, the contrast was marked. This pizza was fresh and tasty, and I would have had more if I hadn't had so many other things I wanted to sample.

I think my favorite part was the salad station. A nice selection of lovely, fresh greens, and all kinds of toppings and mix-ins...and the entertaining salad chef puts it together for you and tosses it to order for you!

I don't eat it myself, but you seafood fans will be happy to know that yes...they have unlimited king crab legs and drawn butter. Every buffet in Vegas has unlimited crab legs. It's a thing.

Oh, and did I mention the free beer and wine? That's right...you get all the beer or wine you want as part of the price of your meal (soft drinks as well, of course).

And the price? Well, this is Vegas, so it's not not cheap, but it's not bad at $26.99/person (especially when you factor in the drinks). We had a better food selection, MUCH better quality food, a knowledgeable and friendly staff, a better 
selection of drinks, and just an all-around better experience, at a fraction of the cost. From here on out, Cravings will be our FIRST pick when it comes to buffet dining in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went for early dinner on a weekday around 5 pm. There was a line of about 20 people and it moved pretty slowly. Once we were seated, we were very surprised to find the restaurant almost empty. I don't understand the wait if the restaurant is barely half full. Empty tables everywhere. 

Food was mostly average, however the clam chowder, make your own tacos (especially loved the fresh guacamole), and tamales were really good. They also have a pasta cooking station which was good. They didn't have a menu or list indicating which pasta types, sauces, or other ingredients you can add to your pasta which was very unpractical. You'd have to peek into the cooking station to try and get a glimpse of what's available. I had bowtie pasta with alfredo sauce, pesto, and bacon. 

Crab legs were small and dry, prosciutto and cheeses were dry (you can tell they've been left out a while - maybe since breakfast or lunch), ribs were dry (sauce was good though, so it's a shame the meat was so dry), pizza tasted old. 

Dessert was super meh. Small selection and all of it tasted stale (pastries, cookies, and cakes were all very dry). Only decent thing were the mini cupcakes (the kind you buy in a 12-pack at the grocery store...)

Servers were good with clearing dirty plates. 

Overall, I would not return to this buffet unless it was super cheap (which it isn't)."}
{"text":"We bought a travelzoo voucher for this place. The food was okay, nothing special. I probably wouldn't pay full price. Service was fine. Dessert was probably the best"}
{"text":"My review is solely for the service alone. There's nothing that could ruin a dining experience when you are greeted with bad service. The hostess named Maria was extremely rude to us.I will never go back to this place again nor will I recommend it."}
{"text":"Weekend brunch with unlimited beer/wine was $36 per person.  All self service including drinks but they expect to add 15-20% for tips at the register as you pay.  No player discount included.  

Was it worth it?  I guess for Las Vegas prices. 

Sushi, prime rib, brisket and crabs seem to be their draw in items.  I loved the opportunity to have a cup for the different sauces.  Taste was good for these items.  

I tried their fried chicken- it was skin less and dry. Didn't care for most of their other items.   Tasty side items such as their potato selections. Well seasoned.  

Would I return?  Probably not, this trip.  But I'd revisit on another trip."}
{"text":"More like 3.5. Went there for breakfast and had a bit of lunch as well. For me, there was nothing special but the food is good, especially veal, Bacon (of course) and most of the dessert."}
{"text":"Another short and sweet review of a buffet.

One thing that this buffet does REALLY good is their Salad Bar. I started there and I was extremely impressed by how fresh the ingredients were and how great the dressing tasted. PLUS, the little cheese display right next to the salads provided some delicious eats as well.

Everything else about the buffet was super disappointing though, aside from the service, which was actually pretty good. The food was not tasty and totally not worth as much as they were charging."}
{"text":"The. worst. buffet. EVER. We used myvegas rewards to get 2 comped dinners and felt like it was a total waste using it on this buffet. Only good for people who like to drink and don't care for food quality as the price includes unlimited wine and beer. Other than that, the layout of the buffet was weird and the food choices were extremely limited. The snow crab didn't even have crab in them! It was a pile of empty shells. Desserts were absolutely awful and again, limited selection. You have to go get your own drink (water, sodas, juice, etc) all the way in the back of the room (we were seated towards the entrance so that was a LONG trek). 

They charge $39.99 midweek which I think is a total rip if you're just looking to eat and not drink. Go to aria or bellagio for good food. Go here if you just want unlimited booze."}
{"text":"Going into Cravings, I didn't think I would leave it 5 stars.. however, this is the reason for that score: price for the quality, service, and the utmost importance factor- unlimited beer and wine included in the cost of the buffet!

The buffet is located to the right of the Mirage front entrance, right off the casino.

The buffet dinner costs about $30 per adult, and included unlimited beer and wine. Most buffets charge between $15-20 extra per person to add unlimited beer/wine, so that was a huge bonus for us! Beer and wine is served at the back bar, be sure to give your bartender a buck or two every time you go back to the bar. If you have any beer or wine left, drink it down a little and they will put the remaining amount in a plastic cup so you can take it with you.

The buffet has a huge variety of items, from a nice salad cheese/charcuterie station, soups, Asian station or two, American, Italian, and also a meat carving station. The buffet had something for everyone!

The dessert station had a lack of variety, that's the only thing I would say needed some help.

All servers were really good, professional, and checked on us consistently throughout our meal. You can't compare Cravings to a Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal Buffet experience but it is top notch for the price point it is at, and all other items mentioned above."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with this buffet at all when I went. My hubby only went for the crab legs. I piled a bunch of fruit and veggies in my plate after tasting a few meats and sides that wasn't to my liking. Overall, I'm picky about my food and like it as simple as possible.  However, the inside of the buffet is pretty. They gave us free wine and beer but, I'm not a drinker so, I could care less. I probably wouldn't return but, if my better half wants crab again, on our next visit he may drag me back with him."}
{"text":"I have to say eating here was a horrible experience.. 6 of us went and 4 got really sick, not good odds especially cause we all were eating different things. At first we were so excited, literally every kind of food represented and it all looked great.. as we were eating tho our excitement dwindled, the food tasted similar to a college cafeteria. If i had to go again i would stick to the salad bar which looked great actually, then again so did everything else. I have eaten at several buffets in Vegas that were exceptional.. don't miss those great ones by choosing cravings at the Mirage."}
{"text":"I ate here with my 3 friends. We put down an insane amount of crab legs, corn muffins, prime rib, sushi, chinese food, pizza, carrot cake and ice cream.

Immediately afterward, we all went to the bathroom next to the buffet, took a seat in 4 adjacent stalls, and we all had massive Mirage Buffet babies together while making fart noises with our arms. 

The food was fine. No great shakes, standard buffet fare, followed by the standard buffet run to drop a major deuce."}
{"text":"My wife and I stayed at the Mirage recently so we decided to come here for lunch... I believe for lunch it was about $24 each. 

I did my usual walk around the entire buffet and kind of felt like there wasn't a lot of meat? I think they had a prime rib, and the rest was just standard stuff. Not sure if I'm crazy, or maybe the options are better for dinner.

The entire area is huge and there is plenty of seating throughout. If I remember correctly, wine and beer were all you can drink? Which I thought was pretty cool and well worth the entry price if you can throw a few of those back.

Our waitress never came around and we thought the food was average, but it was at least worth a try..."}
{"text":"After all the bad service and food I had experienced in Vegas I was wonderfully surprised when I visited this buffet for lunch. First of all $20 for lunch with such an extensive menu was a big bonus. Especially since most restaurants in Sin City would charge you $17 for a Subway-esque sandwich.

I loved that they had a little something for everyone. The coffee was YUMMY. The pizza was delish, bubbly cheese and spicy sauce right out of a brick oven. The prime rib was over cooked, but the baked ham was yummy. In the southern foods section they had the most amazing creamed corn ever. Fresh fresh FRESH jumbo shrimp w/ cocktail sauce. fantastic salad bar where they would make a personal salad for you. And absolutely kick ass kim chee.

But dessert....piece de resistance. I was so full I didn't originally even want any. But my friend said they had bread pudding, so I had to check it out. OMG. So so so good. Melt in your mouth magic. They also had a wide range of cakes, brownies, warm and gooey cookies, and homemade gelato.

What really made the whole experience though was the woman working in our section. Very attentive. Never let a plate sit on our table longer than a minute or two once we were done with it. She was fun and chatty and had great restaurant tips and show ideas. When I told her I loved the bread pudding she told us a great story about the origins of the recipe. AND THEN brought me a copy of it. And we aren't talking a new printed copy, it looked and felt like it had been pulled right out of the recipe binder from the kitchen! Totally amazing!!

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Used a 2 for 1 buffet reward from the My Vegas app/game. Two people for breakfast on a week day ended up being $14.03, which is a great deal! After I redeemed the reward on the app I had to visit the Mlife players club to activate it on my card. They suggest that you redeem whatever reward you're going to use the day of, since you only have 24 hours to use it (or you lose it). Redeeming my reward at the buffet was easy, just let the cashier know you're using one and they take care of the rest. 

The buffet is located at the back of the casino floor, close to Stack. The dining room is huge, and it was packed at 9am. Scored a booth on the side at the end, so we had lots of room. The food choices are expansive! Almost every station was open for breakfast, even the pizza area! They were making omelets and breakfast pizzas, yum! They offered every type of breakfast pastry you could ever want, along with every type of breakfast meat you could ever want. Tons of choices, but if you're vegetarian you might have a harder time filling up. I don't eat pork, so my meat options were pretty slim, but I had more than enough on my plate to make up for it. 

They have a bar set up in the back - it was open for breakfast but I don't know if the drinks are extra. The buffet areas are a little spread out, but you need to do a little extra walking after eating here lol. I have recommended this buffet to everyone I know visiting Vegas in the near future, it was great! And getting a big discount doesn't hurt, so sign up for the MyVegas game if you want 2 for 1!"}
{"text":"All you can eat and drink was nice, had some decent dinner options, roasts where very good, Chinese was ok, pizza so so, and the dessert was hot and miss, couple of things tasted great others garbage, the new York cheese cake was very dissaponiting, probably the worst I have ever had."}
{"text":"Average food. Nothing terrible, but nothing great either. $25 lunch buffet (noon on Fri). Not too busy. Kids over 10 years old pay the adult price. 

Sad when you have to tell your kids to eat more dessert. Not even the kids ate much, after a few bites.

Bread pudding was above average. Presentation looked soggy and sad, but it was moist and warm. Don't forget the vanilla sauce on the side. Fried plantains were good! 

The carving station, fishmonger, Asian food... All kind of dated and sad. Nothing stood out. Service was pleasant and the Asian lady cleared the dishes away relatively quick. 

Asian, small salad area, Latin, American, Italian, dessert, drinks, carving station, breakfast area... 

Think I'd rather go to Soup Plantation or Fresh Choice (Sweet Tomatoes), where the salads are really good. Here, while there was variety, nothing was great."}
{"text":"You know, I actually like this buffet. It's relatively cheaper than other buffets, and it still has a good selection. I went for brunch on a Saturday, and it was around $30 per person. I had $50 dining credit, which I promptly used here.

I loved the bottomless mimosas (maybe a little too much, as I then proceeded to spill a plastic cup of iced tea towards the end of my meal right into my bag). The beer and wine is all included too."}
{"text":"This is the buffet at the Mirage. It was great! Make your own pasta station, pizza station, American food(Mac n cheese, beef ribs, fridchicken, mashed potatoes), Latin food(tamales, chicken Fajitas, rice, guacamole, black beans), seafood(crab legs, osters, shrimp, fish), meat carving station(turkey, corned beef, roast beef), Asian food(pot stickers, egg rolls, Mongolian beef, chow mein, sushi), salad bar, meat/cheese bar, dessert, and two types of soups at each station. They are adding another section that's currently under construction. 

Plus!!! For the price of the dinner buffet, $35, its unlimited beer, cider and wine!!! 

If you play myVEGAS rewards game you can earn the bogo for dinner at 13,000 points."}
{"text":"No wait (versus the very long one at the Wynn).  Food was decent (for buffet), though far from spectacular.  Bottomless mimosas."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch: cheap champagne, cheap breakfast... if you stick to the basics bacon, pancake, hash browns... you'll be ok... desserts were terrible... but as with Aria, they did have a nice selection of cheeses and deli meats."}
{"text":"Average buffet, with average food. Typical stuff I can buy at my local grocery store, and make myself. It is Vegas, so everything is overpriced for what you get. Although, the buffet had unlimited alcohol included. I didn't touch the alcohol, though. (what a surprise)
I had a buy one, get one free deal, so I definitely took advantage of it! My boyfriend and I got our $30 worth of food in. The shrimp made me a bit nervous to eat, so I didn't really touch the seafood area. My boyfriend ate the shrimp, and he was just fine. But, seafood makes me kinda nervous at buffets. Lol. Lots of varieties to drink! Good desserts. The coconut macaroons were pretty much rock solid. If you have fillings, I would not recommend eating them! There is a lot of food to choose from! If you want to eat here, come hungry! ;)"}
{"text":"I met some out of town friends and of course they wanted buffet. The people are very friendly and helpful. The food is a bit better than most. The only thing I don't understand is that you have to get your own drink. It sounds petty but at the stations they get your drinks while you get your food. It's on the table when be you get back. I feel the Mirage is a nice enough place to provide this service. Its over three times the price. They do have a local discount, that was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"This was the worst buffet I've ever eaten at in my life, including local chinese buffets, golden corral, etc.  Many different and spread out stations, each with only a few bad choices.  Italian station was some kind of spaghetti, meatballs, and then the rest was pizza, all of it was bad.  Most of the stations had two hot soup options and/or dips and spreads that appeared to be there just to take up space and make it look like more variety than it was.  The prime rib was overcooked and seriously under seasoned and the crab legs were ice cold and ruined by being sliced in half long ways so you had to dig out the meat with a fork, not to mention they were small snow crab legs to begin with.  Even the cocktail shrimp were very \"shrimpy\" tasting, not good.  I would have been disappointed with this buffet even if it was completely comped.  There was not anything that was worth eating, I'd have rather eaten at the food court in the Fashion Show Mall."}
{"text":"A nice combination of value and options.  Quality was decent too.  Waiter and other staff were realy nice and helpful.

We came in tired and hungry.  We left tired, but happy and sated.

DON'T MISS THE GELATO CASE TO THE RIGHT OF THE DESSERT AREA.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Used to be 4.5 stars when 1st opened
Whenever LV new buffets open on the strip, ala wynn, PH, bellagio, Mirage, they are the shit to begin, then go downhill fast while prices increase.
The Mirage buffet is another example.
For those that can actually taste quality and arent automatic shit-inhalers, big time crap here. After 3-4 years decided to plunk down a ridiculous $75 bucks for a sunday brunch. BIG mistake. But where else can you really eat under $50 for two except mcdonalds?

Good:
Pastami pizza (but limited selection wheres the cool veggies/pepperoni homey?
the mexican rice
Diet cokes strong like bull
salad bar (so-so limp-ass romaine lettuce but good toppings)
Deli cuts next to salad bar=its ok, I guess, but I dont pay $35 to eat mortadella cold cuts bro.
Service- fast at picking up plates and refilling. Another 15% so that makes buffet 85 bucks for two. Frightening, and it sucks.

The bad:
Crab legs-dry and tasteless, 1000% frozen. (acutally some still frozen pick fast or angry mob behind you will press)
Oysters turned into oyster shooters to mask the huge size and farm-raised taste.
Chinese station=worse than panda express. MUCH worse.
Sushi station---OMG 1/4 of a inch of fish in their prepared handrolls. Not joking. I  posted a pic;insanely claseless ripoff, 98% unchewable seaweed and rice. Wow what a fucking joke.
nachos=no melted cheese, no taco meat, but they have tortillas! Ridiculous. Yeah, I guess I'll make a salsa burrito with lettuce, LMAO
Fish on dishes, sitting and waiting for the bus...missed many buses.
Coated buffalo wings=wow gross orange coating, filthy.
Leftover breakfast items=no thanks nastee.
seafood ceviche, etc=anything at raw bar is a total joke and crap.
Dumpling/noodle section=crappy pork or chicken, or something that somewhat resembles shrimp (maybe its distant cousin from the farm-rasied sewers of bangladesh) No offense, bangladeshians.

Save your money. The deli, cpk, HELL taco bell anything beats this. Actually, Taco bell kicks ass.
Ate 4-5 plates just out of frustration and to equal the value of what we paid, but you can finish the whole buffet and still feel cheated..."}
{"text":"Great place to eat - they have a wide variety of all types of food and everyone can find something they like!  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I honestly don't like their breakfast buffet, but my husband loves it (hence the three stars). I've been three times, and I would say it's nothing special. I'm not a buffet person at all though so eh, take my review for what you will.

I feel like I gravitate towards the same items: eggs benedict (which I eat only a bite of because it's \"meh\", french toast (I put strawberries and cool whip because I'm healthy like that), cereal (because it's cereal), and maybe a muffin. They have lots of options, but I feel like the food is pretty standard."}
{"text":"Probably someone else set a super high expectation for me regarding Las Vegas buffet, I was expecting at least 3-star food here. But later I realize what you expect to get with 30 bucks all-you-can-eat... the foods are either way salty (we are talking about all meats here, beef, pork and chicken) or without any flavor (here I mean ALL veges and seafood)... every dish taste like sea, or sugar, or nothing. It's basically a very healthy version of vege and very junky meat that at least looks healthy... My bad for going with buffet on a Christmas Eve which literally ruins my night... luckily I got something afterward that I booked way ahead of time just in case anything went wrong with my food. On the good side, fruits are freshly cut which are satisfying, if you are a cantaloupe lover and can't find fresh fruits elsewhere around here, feel free to stop by and buy your $30 fruit basket. Another bright side, food safety is not an issue, which is in fact great."}
{"text":"Maybe we got really lucky late night but my fiancé and I were really surprised at how great everything was. Unlimited beer and wine with almost every food you can possibly think of that tasted great! Even our server was on top of everything, really kind and probably one of the best servers we've even experienced and it was only a buffet lol"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch since we were already in the Mirage hotel hopping. We didn't plan on eating here the day we went but since we were already here we decided to give it a try. They have a lot of different varieties of food to choose from although some were a little bland, the desserts don't disappoint though  since they have a lot of choices from gelato, cakes, cheesecakes, etc. 

It was a bit pricey although most Las Vegas Buffets are the same but I've been to better tasting buffets. 3 stars for taste of food, the service staff was great though."}
{"text":"Compared to other buffets in the Strip, this place is definitely sub par.
The dining area looks nothing like a resort standard restaurant.
Very limited food options and poorly presented. The only two things that were worth the money were crab legs and prime ribs and theyre not even seasoned well."}
{"text":"Ate a late breakfast here one day, but early enough to be able to get the omelet and eggs benedict I was longing for upon entering the buffet. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more fruit options other than pineapple, a variety of melon, and peaches, but realized it might be because breakfast was going away soon en lieu for lunch. The french toast was really spicy and sweet (our table loved that). The lunch items getting set out looked really good too, but alas I was too full to partake. I should have saved room for some of the gelato or chocolate chip cookies I saw as we were walking out."}
{"text":"Since I was staying at Planet Hollywood, I thought I'd return to this buffet (I tried it last year) for lunch.  At the door, you will need to pay $21.99 (unless you found another deal) then you'll be seated.  The hostess gave me option where I wanted to seat.

I was greeted by Nakeisha, server,  She was okay - not super welcoming.  She had offered me beverage service.  Just a soda for me today.  She proceeded to tell me about the buffet.  

There are plenty of stations to choose from.  I first started with Seafood. then to salads, then to the Italian section - the rolls were really good.  Highly recommend.    As I was just finishing up my salad, there was a small incident (light bulb had exploded) at the carving station so that selection was immediately shut down for a thorough clean up.  Within 10 minutes or so, it was back up and running.  I found the food to be very good for a buffet.  The time I was there, the noise level was not bad.

For a buffet in Las Vegas, I was recommend it."}
{"text":"I have read most of the reviews here and these people all have their taste in the cigarette butt they left in their beer can last night( or this morning).  The service was attentive and my champagne must have been refilled 7  or 8 times, plus Sharon brought us two huge cups to go, which would have been worth the $35 tab alone. But besides that, the breakfast buffet included chilled crab legs and shrimp, sushi, ceviche, noodles, chilled seafood salads, prime rib, veal bacon, smoked chicken wings, ribs, short ribs, crab cake Benedict, Bananas Foster french toast, tons of fresh fruit, Caribbean seafood stew, gelato in numerous flavors, smoked salmon and gravlax, shiu mai and pho, plus scrambled eggs and pancakes if you want to waste your time on them.  My advice is to walk the entire line to determine what you would like to eat before you begin filling your plate.  There is also a cooked-to-order egg station, but why eat eggs when you can have prime rib an crab legs?"}
{"text":"Cravings was the second buffet I experienced in Vegas other than the Buffet at the Wynn and the experience was GREAT!  My friends, boyfriend and I went on Sunday for Brunch.  We were in line for maybe 30 minutes?  

The food was good, they have everything just like the buffet at the Wynn (maybe just not as much choices) but enough for a buffet.  The best part was all you can drink MIMOSAS! =) oh, and i'm glad i was able to save room for some gellato ice cream... my bf and I tried the watermelon and white chocolate macadamia gellato ice cream.  They were both good but the watermelon one was really good! my friends were full but i told them to try our watermelon ice cream, once they tried it, they got up and got their own =)

I recommend to go here if you're on a budget, we only paid $28 compare to $40 plus for dinner at the Wynn.."}
{"text":"I have experienced much better....the free beer and wine would be great if u like beer and wine. The food quality was not great to me except the Asian dishes.The deserts were not even that good....I do like how open the restaurant is and service was fast. In some ways I like that the fountain drinks are self served. All in all.. it was ok..."}
{"text":"As usual this buffet doesn't disappoint. The gelato is awesome as well as the cookies we had. The food is really good, except for a few things we had were ok. We had the lunch buffet here. Overall is was a very good experience."}
{"text":"Food variety is ok, Service is ok. But after we get there our friend tries to go to bathroom (no bathroom in buffet) after just setting plate down - they say you can't leave and get back in.  Uh what you can't go to the bathroom before you eat or during you meal and get back in - really.  Then we raised with management who said it was ok - this time.  That's ok for $32 there are much better choices and there will not be a next time."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast our first day in our most recent trip to Vegas.  It didn't seem the same quality as when we came here for our honeymoon (almost 13 years ago) but the price was right.  For $20 we got a decent buffet with a good selection but the best thing was what has to be considered a secret (considering there was no line at 10 am): unlimited bloody Mary's/wine/mimosas were included!  If you're looking for a great way to start your day, this is it!"}
{"text":"Great buffet, excellent food and beverage selection, helpful and friendly staff!
Pricey ($34.99), but worth it!"}
{"text":"Eh ... This wasn't my choice to eat here but my brother insist since its better than wicked spoon but i think he's wrong..
Came here on Saturday night and line was empty and we were sat right away!  
Food ranged from American, Latin, Asian, and Italian.  
Food was alright"}
{"text":"Just average for dinner on a thursday.  People were great food was not. More along the line of a 10.00 buffet. We used a coupon from my vegas so it was buy one get one free.  Wont be back :("}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and was excited to find out it was only $20. Well breakfast turned into brunch while we were there thankfully. I was very unimpressed with breakfast. The lunch food was slightly better. Good shrimp, bad mussels. I liked that we could get our drinks ourselves and wine and beer with included in that $20 price. 

Overall, underwhelming, I went here 6 days ago and I cant really remember anything else about this place. Thankfully it was cheap."}
{"text":"This place looks like your college dorm cafe with nice decorations. Many variety of food to pick from. Like other post, it is limited on desserts. The highlight of this buffet is their noodle bar, king crab & shrimp cocktail and their PRIME RIB. WOOAH. Service was ok."}
{"text":"To review Las Vegas buffets I've broken it down into 4 sections.

Appetizers:
Nice selection.  Cravings claim to fame is their new sections of global cuisine.  You can have some nice appetizers to entrees from each section. 

Salads:
Very nice salad section.  They will make custom salads to your order.

Main Entree:
They have many worldly selections representing from China, Mexico, Japan, Italy and more..   Some are better than others but the variety is good and quality is above average. 

Desserts:
Since Cravings breaks everything out into their own sections, they have a decent dessert section as well.  Most are mass manufactured goods and some are custom, like the gelato.

I was torn to give them 3.5 or 4 stars, but decided to round it off to 4 stars since they deserve something better than a 3.  So if you have any \"Cravings\" for worldly cuisine, this is a good place to go.


Decor: 4 Stars (its been refreshed since the original opening)
Service: 3 Stars (decent staff)
Atmosphere: 3 Stars (its okay)
Food Quality: 4 Stars (good quality)
Quantity of Food: 5 Stars (its all you can eat)
Price: 4 Stars (almost worth the high price)

For a Grand Total of 4 Stars."}
{"text":"Came here last year and had a great time. This year we came back expecting the same but instead got a horrible experience. The food wasn't as good as last year. Only good thing is that beer and champagne are limitless."}
{"text":"Had the champagne brunch here and I thought it was really good. Definitely one of the better Vegas buffets. Weekend brunch is about $32 a person. There was seafood available. I had fried shrimp, crab legs, muscles, and 2 hearty helpings of prime rib because it was so yummy!! There is a good amount of food here and the place is clean. Everything I tried was yummy, except for the wonton soup - that was nothing special. Service was prompt and good. There was also a good selection of dessert and I was too full to try it all. What I didn't like was at the dessert, some of the signs just say \"assorted\"... as if I know what that includes!!! Anyways, I guess that's why it's a buffet and you can try it all anyways! LOL. They also have gelato here. Seems like most buffets have gelato now... much better than ice cream or worst, soft serve!!!

This buffet is worth trying!! I wasn't disapointed at all!"}
{"text":"It's Lit  shoutout to cravings I put down 20 mimosas and 6 beers and they never cut me off, world class organization and the workers here are phenomenal !!!"}
{"text":"This was a disappointment even amongst buffet's. The meat was either under cooked or over cooked. The crab legs in particular should be avoided. I expected more for the price 30 dollars?!?. Avoid this one at the dinner price."}
{"text":"Thoughts: Meats at the carving station- Very Good! Ribeye and Brisket on Point, Carver gave me huge piece.
Shrimp- good, crab legs- too much work 
Sushi is awful, don't waste your time!
Mexican Food - Not a lot of Choices 
American- Pretty good 
Unlimited Wine and Beer is Nice!
Pizza - pretty good 
Mac & Cheese - Good 

I would not go to this Buffet unless I stayed @ Mirage which we did.

Really 2.5 stars! 
Food Quality needs improvement

Servers very friendly and Efficient!"}
{"text":"Okay, okay, okay, so there probably isn't much differentiating buffets in Las Vegas, but I promised myself I'd review every place I ate and drank while visiting.

Cravings was our first breakfast stop when visiting - mainly because we had two free breakfast vouchers. The servers were extremely nice, there were SO many food options available (everyone at our table left happy) and the atmosphere was relaxed. If I were visiting Mirage again, I'd probably return to Cravings for breakfast since it's in the hotel."}
{"text":"First night and we need to get some good dinner. 

Chaste and clean but not really spotless, It would be a four star but I reserve that for other International buffets like one I had in SoCA, forgotten. I think this ones @ Mirage Hotel and Casino. Its like $25 per head, I usually go to just the Asian/ American food but if I was to choose, I wouldnt come here. Buffet is good once in a while but i like doing ala cartes better. A narrower choice of food menu satisfies me more at the end of the meal. 

This place is not for me that night. I was tired-- i couldve settled for a subway and go to bed or start the chillaxing. I eat only to the point im full and not to the point of almost puking just to get your money's worth. My sis loves food and oh how she loves buffet. I guess she splurged with all those desserts. If she has a yelp account this would surely get high stars for her."}
{"text":"My only complaint about the Mirage casino. I had dinner here, and it was $27 a person PLUS a 45 minute wait in line. Because of that, I had high expectations, but I was extremely let down. I didn't pay $27 to eat Costco Potstickers or \"sushi\" (if you count cucumbers wrapped in rice w\ soy sauce packets). The swordfish they had was disgusting and very dry.  They did have tossed salads and made to order paninis, but I consider that something that is more suiteable for lunch. The prime rib was OK at best, 

The environment is nice though, all the tables are spread apart so you can actually have a conversation. Its well lit as well. Only if the food wasn't so crappy.."}
{"text":"This buffet has a reasonable 3 stars. Nothing special, but not horrible. If you are a seafood person, I would not recommend this buffet. My husband said the meat was better then the Bellagio. Atmosphere definitely not as good. Price is $40 a person. I would say, not worth it."}
{"text":"I had 2 tickets for a free buffet at any MGM property, so my boyfriend and I decided to go here based on the reviews. Our first buffet was the buffet at Treasure Island, so we already had a low opinion of buffets. But we enjoyed our meal here. There is a variety of options, from different types of cuisines to the dessert. They have your typical buffet food, and we really liked the variety.

The desserts were also pretty decent, as they have gelato, that my boyfriend enjoyed. The bread pudding is also really good."}
{"text":"The way this buffet is organized has to be one of the best on the strip. It is easy to get in line, the place is spacious and most importantly the beverages are self serve. The price includes wine and beer so it is a great deal. The food is good, but not great so don't expect to see the little extras that you might at a higher priced buffet. Otherwise if you are nearby and looking for value, this would be a good choice."}
{"text":"We enjoy the buffet at the Aria much better. Cravings is cafeteria food with a few shrimps and crab legs thrown in. The salad bar is almost non-existent, and everything else is basic (chicken, Mexican food, pasta and Pizza, and macaroni and cheese. Not worth 30.00 a person. I'm not a drinker, but I think most people come here not for the food, but rather the all you can drink beer and wine. I know it's not for the food."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times before and it's very good.  By far the best is the salad area, where they make your salad to your specifications.  Plus they had a couple of others salads, including Israeli salad with bits of falafel in it.  Excellent.
Yes, the dessert area isn't that exciting, I think there's WAY too much emphasis on Asian food.  But all in all, you can do a lot worse, but not that much better."}
{"text":"I have came here twice now and noticed they are very consistent with their food selections. Prime rib is a little dry but is always at buffets. They do offer crab and free beer, wine, or soda which is a plus. The dessert selection is neat because they have a ton of tiny items, so you can try them all.  This buffet is worth it if you get can it for free off the myvegas game, but if you can't,  I would save your $30 and just go to a restaurant instead."}
{"text":"Best breakfast buffet we have ever been to in Vegas. With a price of $15.99 per adult for breakfast, you can't beat this place! Huge variety of food and everything we tried was really good! I don't just mean \"buffet food good\", I mean actually good!!!! Don't miss this one!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's a decent place to have lunch.  I came here yesterday for lunch and the price was $20 per person.  Thankfully, my brother-in-law was Papa Georgio this week and had Gold Status with M life and we got comped for four lunches.  There were a lot of choices to pick from like a Asian food section, BBQ, Italian, Latino, and a raw section too.  My favorites were the cioppino, sweet potato fries, and their  shrimp.   They also had a salad bar where they prepared the salad for you with everything you wanted. Their selection of desserts was pretty disappointing though.  I probably wouldn't come here for dinner based on their lunch selection and quality, but I would go to the lunch again if need be."}
{"text":"The 2 stars is for the service. We went to the breakfast/brunch buffet on the weekend of the GGG vs Canelo fight. The hostess and server were very rude and unprofessional. We've never had issues at the mirage buffet. The food is also really good. That morning the service was unprofessional and unacceptable. They must of forgot about customer service."}
{"text":"Ehh I don't recommend going here the prime rib is dry all the things in carving and American the food is dry and on some bowls they aren't cleaned very well . I got a bowl i thought it was clean but it was a total MESS . I will not think I would come here again"}
{"text":"My family and I had been a little cautious coming to different buffets we did not know simply because their prices are always so high and not worth the rate. My boyfriend and I decided to go take a look at their dinner buffet the night before and it looked pretty good so we decided to go check it out the next night. We had gone for their holiday dinner buffet and paid 28 per person with a discount we had gotten. No lines, no fuss, just went to pay and got seated within minutes! The workers were friendly and helpful! You don't need to wait for your drinks as they have everything you want in their \"refreshers\" section. Everything tasted amazingly good! We were all so shocked! We have tried Paris, Bellagios and none of them tasted how Mirages buffet did! Everything was organized perfectly and everything tasted very fresh! Their carving station was amazing! Only down fall is they close at 9 pm so you cant stick around for too long! And their dessert section needs to be bigger! But with all those foods that had such good quality it was not that big of a deal!"}
{"text":"One of the best under-$20-buffet in Las Vegas.  

A myriad of selections from various cultures and traditions.   

The secret to enjoying Craving??    Try a little of everything, and don't fill yourself up with stuff that cost them nothing such as:   rice, Chinese noodles, machine-made sushi, and cheap breakfast items.  

Go straight for the tender slices of roast beef and generous portions of crab legs.     Add some of the freshly grounded chimichurri sauce.    There are special condiments to add to your food placed all around the restaurant.  Its your job to select them out, try them, and then decide whether they go hand-in-hand with certain dishes.  

Save room for the vast selection of delectable desserts!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the price gauging... Sunday before President's Day is deserving of $40 for breakfast! To add insult to injury, they don't tell you that you have to get your own drinks so I added a $10.00 tip to the tab. Again this was breakfast at 9:00 in the morning, the scrambled eggs were tastless, the bacon undercooked and I had to go to each designated country before stumbling on hash browns. Since I do not posess the skills to carry multiple things at once, I gathered my breakfast items then set out on the long journey to the very back of the restaurant to search out coffee. First urn bone dry, success on second urn. Grab some oj and head back to a plate of tepid food. So coffee is hot, but food is not. I feel if I did the reverse then I would have tepus coffee. Tried a plate of crunchy melon, it is Feb granted, but someone has to know as they cut it up that it just sucks. Not sure if I will stay at the Mirage again. Use to be one of my favorites, but the nickle and diming is just an insult!"}
{"text":"We tried this place both in the morning and afternoon and it was horrible. All the food was poorly made and cold despite being under warming lamps. Only things I enjoyed at the buffet was the salad, cereal, and coffee and those are all basic things that are pretty hard to mess up.
Unless you have a discount on this place, find somewhere else to eat. It's not worth the full price tag. Head to the White Castle or Mcdonald's across the street for about the same quality of food for a much cheaper price."}
{"text":"Visited 4/15/2018 - first time and won't be our last. It was a great place to eat! We used our MyVegas points to redeem the 2 for 1 buffet offer and it was about $35 total for 2 people. Considering the seafood and meat section, that wasn't a bad price. We spent more for less at other buffets. I like the made to order pasta and the Asian food section! Desserts were delicious and I wished I could've eaten more. Everything was pretty fresh, including the gnocchi with mushrooms. There's more than 1 kind of cheese which I truly appreciate! Sometimes you just gotta have Gouda man!

No bathrooms inside - you have to exit to the left for that.

The drink section is great - lots of teas and the freestyle machine. All you can drink beer and wine is awesome too!
As far as staff and employees go, most were friendly except the cashier at the front. She kept giving us \"the look\" and I'm not even sure why. She took her sweet time and I felt like saying something but didn't. I was just a tad bit too hungry. 

Must try at least once - I think you'll like it."}
{"text":"Located in The Mirage, this is one of the better buffets I've eaten at on the strip. It offers good value! The food quality is better than others for approximately the same price. It's in a brighter, more modern-trendy atmosphere. I do not typically seek out buffets but I would eat here again if staying at the Mirage."}
{"text":"Buffet, food is ok. The waitresses serving inside are great. But the people at the entry - cashier and front gate (security) are just horrible - grumpy, rude and ignorant.

The security person at front closed the gates at 8:20p even though hours opened was till 9:00p. Had to fight to get in."}
{"text":"I tend to stay away from buffets because, like Forrest Gump says, \"You never know what you gonna get.\" We had already eaten at two other Mirage restaurants during our weekend stay, so by process of elimination, we tried the buffet Cravings, which I kept calling 'Carvings'. LOL. Great quality & wide variety & fair pricing. I liked everything I had for brunch. A few items to highlight: freshly made - in plain view - brick over pizza, freshly-made on-site gellato ice cream with a nice variety of toppings. Fresh, custom salads & omelettes & sundaes are made for you while you wait. 

The one thing that could have satisfied me more was a better variety of sushi. They offered 5 basic options of sushi rolls on par with what you could get from the supermarket, BUT I won't hold that against them. 

I would definitely recommend Cravings & I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying, I enjoy more creative / fine dining establishments. And have a more refined palate then the average consumer. So I'm rating Cravings with this in mind.  I sampled a little bit of everything, and it was meh...nothing special, nothing note worthy. Starting with the pasta station, the sausage was like warm and the cheese ravioli were soggy. Moving on to the carving station, roast turkey was juicy, but tasted like processed turkey breast. The mashed potatoes are clearly powdered, and the gravy had several clumps of gelatinized goop. The corn was tasty. I skipped the seafood due to an allergy. The Mexican bar provided Taco Bell quality cheese sauce and ground beef. Moving forward to the sushi station, as good as you can get for sushi on a buffet, bulk made rolls. As for the Asian station, the pork dumpling and noodle soup was bland and the noodles were undercooked which  is shocking for a buffet soup. The gyoza was dry and hard, and the wonton was stale. They did have descent desserts and included alcohol, so that was a plus. If it wasn't a business trip that was paying for the meal, I would never pay $40 for a buffet that is no better then the finest Quincy's or Golden Corral."}
{"text":"Great Sunday and Saturday brunch with endless mimosas and other alcohol. The prime rib was my favorite even at 8am. The omelette station was nice as well. Tons of food and drinks. Sharon was my waitress two days straight and she was a joy."}
{"text":"Huge selection of food- and they are set up by stations. We arrived at the beginning of the dinner hour. I could tell the food had been sitting under heat lamps for some time. The pros:
Addictive garlic fondue and I ,mean Addictive. I used crostini to dip in and I could have eaten this by the bowl. 
Very tasty and tender beef ribs. Just the right size
Gelato was very refreshing and a great way to end the dinner 
Cons:
What bread there was - was dry 
Hardly anybody was there- which says something
Desserts looked amazing- but didn't live up to what they looked like
Crab had no flavor at all.  Should have had a slightly sweet taste- bit tasteless and small in size."}
{"text":"Omg! Worse buffet I ever been... food cold , not much variety desserts are hard and display dirty... they only good thing is the beer . I have visit other hotels buffets, and this is by far the worse along with Aria buffet."}
{"text":"It's a buffet enough said. Price is decent food was decent only had breakfast."}
{"text":"I really like the food.  For what we paid for, it was totally worth it.  They have plenty of crab legs and seafood varieties like mussels and clams.  I really like the soup.  It's very tasty.  The only thing I was a little annoyed was the services.  Some time, it's hard to get a server to get a refill."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Las Vegas and in addition to the casinos and shows, I had heard wonderful things about the buffets as well. We decided to have lunch at Cravings and will probably will never return if ever at the Mirage hotel again.

We received a discount as part of the conference we were attended (which we have to fight over with the cashier who did not want to honor it). Anyhow, we eventually sat down and proceed to sample the different cuisines they offer (American, Asian, Italian, and so on). The food was average at best, most of the pasta was dry and overcooked and most of the food just did not look fresh and appetizing. The crab was dry and seemed old and hardly any meat!

The best part of Cravings was the generous servings of the carved meats and the \"Chef's Corner\" where, unlike the other serving stations, you could received fresh pasta cooked your way. The dessert selection was ample however, most of the desserts were note very good but with the exemption of a very few. We felt a like a \"Piccadilly Cafeteria\" restaurant experience and not one worthy of the Mirage hotel and Las Vegas but I guess, based on the price, it was reasonable. This is a place for a quick lunch with the kids but do not expect a famous Las Vegas buffet experience here. You get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"have been coming to this breakfast buffet for years and always would look forward to going on my next trip to Vegas. Unfortunately I will probably never visit again. Booked a vacation package through Southwest which included a free buffet for each day we were staying at the Mirage. We did the breakfast buffet on the first day, then the breakfast/lunch buffet on the second day (the third day we got wise and went down to the Aria buffet). The service both times at Cravings was absolutely terrible. We were a party ot 7 and had to practically beg to have our drinks refilled. My empty plates were never cleared...so we just piled them up wherever we could. The server never made a point to apologize for the service and was not friendly whatsoever.

The food was average. It seems to me that they've cheapened the quality of the food (especially the baked goods) and I truly expected more from this Vegas buffet. I honestly can't remember much about the food except for the gelato, which was delicious. 

I'm sad to say I don't plan on going back to the Cravings buffet again."}
{"text":"got a sweet deal from tix4tonight... make sure you check that out.  food was good and had a variety....just don't have the sushi - rice were dried out probably stayed out too long."}
{"text":"On our third day here I didn't want to be rushed to get up early so by the time we meandered downstairs it was lunch time and we were hungry since we had such a small dinner the night before.  Where better to go than the buffet, right?

We missed the breakfast cut off but the difference in price was only $5.00 per person.  They had your standard buffet fare...Chinese, Latin, Italian, Fish, Salad, and a Dessert bar.  Everything was really good but I really liked their Chinese food and their Salad bar.  At this Salad bar you tell the person what you want in your salad and they toss it for you and place it in a bowl.  It was one of the best salads ever!

We enjoyed this buffet so much that we decided to come here for breakfast the next morning after checking out.  We hit up the omelet station right away and made our rounds of gathering up other breakfast goodies.  They are of course much busier for breakfast than they are for lunch and the service reflected that.  

The salad bar was so good from the day before that we waited until 11:00am for the bar to open up so we could get salads again!  I would highly recommend this buffet if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"strictly not for vegetarians as they add chicken powder and broth in almost all the main dishes. they haven't even spared \"yellow rice\" or \"vegetable noodles\". chefs are helpful  enlightening us with our veggie options (hardly anything except a pizza) and were kind enough to make some fresh french fries but that was it!

good selection of deserts though and value for money for general crowd given that the lunch buffet came to 14$ thru tix4tonight."}
{"text":"THE +'s: they do international and they do it smart. not two or three dishes from fifty different countries but a mash up of cultural flavors. there's wonton noodle soup, kimchee (kimchee!!), fancy japanese hand rolls, the regular crab and shrimp cocktail standby, and The Best Prime Rib Ever. plus! a gelato counter and omg that is a great salad bar. great attentive staff. love that modern contempo decor.

THE -'s: at the end of the day, it still has tinges of buffet food flavors (stuff sitting under heaters too long).

SUM: look man. they got FISH TANKS mounted on their seafood station. they have KIMCHEE. not the crappy kind of kimchee but the good kind. most asian buffets can't even get the kimchee right. oh yieah, again, The Best Prime Rib Ever. all this for the excellent price of about $25 per sunday brunch. this place is now my bestest favoritist vegas buffet."}
{"text":"Seriously, this was a shock!  

We came here for breakfast before hitting the pool one morning.  We got our hung over asses up and headed down to prepare for another day of booze, fun and sun.

What was the deal with breakfast!?!?  I mean really, that was the worst breakfast buffet I think I ever had.

Scrambled eggs were from the carton. I hate eggs from the carton, you can always tell those eggs apart from the rest.

Had some rubber bacon, it was horrible as well....Um....Potatoes!!  Had some of those!! Equally as horrible, just a little bit harder that I'm used to....Ok....A lotta bit harder than i'm used to.

What the hell did I consume for breakfast??? Ice cold milk.  It was AWESOME!! Tasted fresh, and Cold, and GOOD!!  Im not kidding you I probably had 5 or 6 glasses.   But i'm sorry, for 20 sumpin bucks.....I could've bought enough milk for a month at the store.

At a buffet (in my opinion) everyone should find SOMETHING they like to eat.  And I gotta be honest and say, I was super disappointed with this place.  La Quinta and Motel 6 have a better continental breakfast.
I was seriously bummed. We wont be back to cravings."}
{"text":"It is interesting that this buffet is 'highly' rated, but we liked it the least out of the 4 that we tried.  WE were fortunate enough to have a free buffet each day, so we were able to compare this one with others.  The selection was minimal, the desserts were unappealing, and the taste was less than average, even for a buffet.  Don't get me wrong, you'll find enough food to fill you up and if you get it for free, even better, but I would never choose to actually PAY for this buffet."}
{"text":"I wish I can give zero star if I can. The cashier & staffs were so rude, no willing to work there. The male manager who were working at when we were there, he wasn't willing to listen my complaint. 

Here is the story. 

I just came here at buffet and i spoke to one of their lady to ask how busy and what's their holiday pricing (usually pricing is different during the holiday). She seemed nice and she said 28.99 + tax. So I didn't buy the discount coupon from tix4tonight. And then I came here and they said pricing is 36.99. And they blamed me that I should remember the lady's name. Do you usually remember the person's name even if you want to ask the general question? Such Hours and pricing? If the manager knows how to treat customers, or manage his employees, they should give us the rate that she mentioned. I wasnt happy that he treated me and my family like this."}
{"text":"This place is so money and they don't even know it...OK maybe the do.

My last time in Vegas we did the Buffet of Buffets pass, and hit Rio, Paris and Planet Hollywood. Overall our verdict was that none of them were that good, with the exception of Paris' brunch being \"OK.\" 

Due to our experience with those places, I assumed that Cravings would be more of the same mediocrity, but because I had two comped passes I had to at least give it a shot. I was impressed to say the least!

The Prime Rib was excellent, they had good beer on tap (Goose Island IPA), options were plentiful and everything was pretty good. I'd take this over Bellagio Buffet any day."}
{"text":"We were a small group of friends that were in town for a softball tourney for a few days. We were told that the Buffet was a great place to eat. One friend was a card member and we got a discount as a group. The average price per is $32.00 this includes all the beer and wine you can drink. There is a great variety of food to choose from. The food includes salads, fruit hot and cold meals, a carving station and crab legs. There is plenty of space in the dining area and you do not feed crowed while eating. They have tacos, mac and cheese, shrimp, crab legs, fish and beef brisket and turkey. The food is cooked to perfection and makes you want to come back for more. Drinks are served at the bar (bring ID) and soda, water and juice are served from drink machines. The wait staff is very friendly and professional they do watch all the tables to clean up the tables and help service the customers. The price is worth the eating at this buffet, plus the professionalism of the staff is a great selling point. I will be back to eat here because of the way we were treated and the great food and selection."}
{"text":"Located in The Mirage..Cravings is about 26 a person. 

Pretty big, and they have their dessert bar, salad section, Greek section, Chinese section, sushi, noodles, raw food, Latin, Breakfast, Italian, and the omelet man. 

I like how majority of the sections have somebody that can make it for you. Noodle section had a lady who can make you your noodles. Salad bar area had a lady who tossed it for me...........no dirty-ness. 

The Chinese food was not good at all. Got the fried rice, bok choy, noodles, and egg roll...did not like any of it. 

They had a good variety for the Latin section most definitely."}
{"text":"Had Sunday brunch there and thought it was very good.  Great Asian section with even dim sum ( love those dumplings).  The peeled shrimp were large and the coctail sauce was spicy good. Carving stations had good variety and deserts were eye and palate pleasing.  Compleatly missed the gelato hiding at the end of the desert section."}
{"text":"Decided to grab a quick bite at The Mirage while waiting to watch a show so Cravings buffet was the answer.  Not too bad.  Didn't really eat anything but prime rib and that was very good.  This seemed like a no frills simple style Vegas buffet with the usual standard selections."}
{"text":"having lived in vegas for 20+ yrs, we have had more than our fair share of buffets... cheap ones, expensive ones, yucky ones and 2-for-1's... so when my husb had a craving for an all you can eat buffet it took him alot of convincing to get me to agree... ALOT!!! reluctantly, i agreed and we headed over to the mirage for no particular reason at all. it was around 
3pm on a wednesday and they were not super busy, but steady... the host and server were pleasant and the food was great! i have a cpl specific allergies i was asking our server about and since she wasnt sure she said shed go ask...what stood out to me though, on our visit, was that two of the chefs came out, introduced themselves, answered all my questions and if they could get us anything!?!? WHAAT!?! how awesome is this???!! they made it a personal experience, made small talk and we walked out of there satisfied... in this world where everyone is so busy and into what theyre into, it really says something about someones integrity when they genuinely care!! just want to make a shout out to: chef Jose Cruz and chef Douglas Oyama!!! they are two cool mofos and w/o a doubt, will be back to their buffet!!!"}
{"text":"We thought Friday night would have a good seafood selection, we were there for Beatle Love at the Mirage. Crab legs and shrimp, one kind of fish, one kind of soup, end of story. Nothing had any flavor. The hot foods were cold, the salads old. Never even thought to try the deserts, we were so done with it all. We stopped on the way home across the street at the White Castle. Very, very disappointed. Better Buffets off the strip and half the price. It's not nasty, but you'll never do it again, and you'll be hungry when you leave."}
{"text":"Came to this buffet after a day of hiking at Zion national park in Utah. We weren't expecting much from it, being the fact that it was in the mirage hotel & we hadn't really heard of it but it was definitely a nice surprise. The food was pretty good & there were pretty good selections. They also had stone crab claws when we were there & I ate like 5 plates of those. They also had a pasta station where they make the pasta on the spot for you. I believe they have two different sauces & types of pastas each day that you can choose from, and then you can choose any of the toppings available to be added into the pan. It was really good.. I ended up getting both sauces & had two plates of pasta. I also ate some of the snow crab legs & a various selection of other food. Granted, I was under the influence when I came here, but I really thought that this buffet was good & that it was underrated. I don't remember much of the dessert selection but I ate mostly the ice cream for dessert. I would definitely recommend this buffet if you're not looking to splurge on the more pricier buffets on the strip."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and while the food was good and the servers were friendly, you can't beat having waitresses that bring you beverages like a real dining experience. There was an omelet station and a lunch meat area with cheeses. There was a Mexican station that looked appetizing. There were mink breakfast burritos that I regret not trying and also chiliquiles."}
{"text":"Best buffet on a budget as far as the strip goes. All you can eat crablegs and prime rib alone covers the $35 it costs to eat here for dinner. I have to say the sushi was a bit disappointing,  like grocery store sushi. All you can drink wine and beer was definitely a pluss."}
{"text":"Poor quality with cold food and commercial kitchen quality food. Not worth the money. So many better choices for food while in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed this..
Yes I am a food snob, yes this is a buffet.

I found myself gorging on the crab legs and jumbo shrimp... The 'made to order' salads were really good and the desert bar is pretty massive.

I expected less... I got more... its $24/head which is expensive, but not for vegas... Well worth it."}
{"text":"Good price ! They had a variety of food from latin, to asian, rosetterie, dessert, salad bar and italian. They had a bit of each in every station. The waitress was super friendly. We got seated fast, and we didnt have to wait in a long long long line like we had to in Bellagio.. lol 
btw the asian food station.. with the sushi.. didnt offer much variety.. the sushi didnt look good either. but other than that good price for good food"}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best buffets I've had in Vegas.  The price is decent, and the food selection was great.  One of my biggest problems with buffets is the fresh-ness/quality of the food, and that didn't seem to be a big issue here.  I also liked their selection of gelato and desserts.  Gelato for brunch, mmm!

**** update 3/27/08
This time Cravings was even cheaper!  I think the key is to come around 10:30, because there's no line then and you get in for breakfast prices ($15) but you can stay into \"lunch\" (prices change at 11 I think).  Again, very satisfied with my meal.  They had fried plantains, and they do Asian food better than any buffet I've been to (which isn't saying that much, but is saying something)."}
{"text":"I had comped passes, but my wife and I really enjoyed this place. Tons of options. So many options that I had to take tiny, tiny, tiny portions my first time through because I really wanted to try it all. They even have a gelato bar. But what they are serving is far from gelato. They basically have put normal ice cream in gelato tins, placed them in a gelato bar and call it gelato. It was basically Breyer's ice cream. It was good, but it wasn't gelato at all. I don't know what the normal price of this place it, but if you go you might as well fast for a day and then go and feast, because there is a grip of food."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. I ate a lot of the asian dishes at the buffet such as the seaweed salad, sushi, and soup. Well, it tasted decent at the time. But, when I got back to my hotel...I soon discovered I got food poisoning. It was horrible! I was running to the bathroom all night long. I suggest you avoid the buffet. It was a terrible night. This was in late August 2015, around the 25th."}
{"text":"Cravings is the third buffet in Vegas I've tried this year and it's right there in the middle. It's better than the MGM Grand Buffet, but not as nice as Aria's Buffet. The variety of choices is huge (they have Italian, Japanese, Chinese, Mexican, and American), but they only have about 4-5 items of each food ethnicity. The shrimp cocktails and king crab legs are of decent size and taste fresh. The prime rib is a notch better than your average buffet. The dessert section is limited, but the taste quality is high. I suggest saving room for the gelato ice cream and many of the pastries. Service was good. 

However, with many other Las Vegas buffets still left to try, I would only eat here again with free dining credit."}
{"text":"I have visited many buffet restaurants in Las Vegas and this is by far one of the best. They have great choices of cuisine, wine and the staff are very courteous. Generally we find the wait staff are not very happy working in buffets it was a pleasant surprise to find that not to be the case here.

My favorite dishes were yogurt with chocolate sprinkles ( yes I like to eat dessert first) prime rib end cut, salad and cheese selection and the beverage selections. I had flavored sparkling water in addition to red wine. 

Great experience and value. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"It's been years, but the Mirage buffet definitely is not like it used to be!  We used to come here EVERY visit, as it was reasonable and food was awesome, but we'll likely skip and just pay a bit more for the Wynn Buffet - big difference in food quality, flavor and selection!

Prices at $33/Adult weeknight dinner is ok.  But, definitely NOT ok for $24/Child!  (7 year olds don't eat that much!)  We've heard about 2-for-1 coupons, so if you have that, it's TOTALLY be worth it, but not at full price for kids.

Open and airy atmosphere.  Food selection is good, but some are just not the quality or flavor we remembered :(.  Some were just overcooked :( 

Service was quick and friendly, but dinner now includes wine or beer, and there is self-serve drinks, so wait staff just clears plates."}
{"text":"Cravings is a solid buffet option with several themed stations with a variety of consistently good food options. Since we often stay at The Mirage Casino Hotel we've visited this buffet probably more than any other.

Buffet includes unlimited draft beer (Budweiser and Goose Island IPA) and house wine (a red and white)"}
{"text":"This is getting a bad review due to customer service, not food quality. I can't actually speak to the food, as we didn't get to eat here this trip  and I don't remember the last time well enough.

We were given a coupon during our stay in Vegas last summer, when we dined here, for a 2 for 1 brunch buffet, any day of the week, anytime before 3pm, with No Expiration Date. It was to encourage us to return to eat here again sometime in the future. We were counting on this deal this time around, to allow us to have a good meal before our current on-a-budget stay in Vegas was over.

When we got to the buffet cashier, we were told that they wouldn't accept our coupon, because they are no longer honoring that deal. They said the coupons where being given out too much, so they stopped taking them. Well...fine, stop handing them out, but honor the ones that were already given out. It isn't our fault that you over estimated your popularity.

We talked to the Food and Beverage Manager, and he condescendingly told us he'd give us 20% off on \"good faith\" on 2 full price buffets, so $20 per person instead of $12. No.  What he SHOULD have done, what the SMART, \"good faith\" choice would've been, was to honor the deal the restaurant made with us when they issued us the coupon with No Expiration Date!  Then, he'd have 2 satisfied customers who would give them good reviews, instead of 2 pissed off ones, who will Yelp, Facebook, and just plain Tell everyone we know to choose a different dining option and never this one.  It isn't fair, or honest, and it's just bad business practice.

Not really the point, but it isn't like either of us are large enough people to cost them a lot of money anyway.  Just saying, MAYBE 1 and a half plates of food each, not even enough to add up to the $12 discount price in actual product. Well worth the cost for them to exhibit good customer care and keep us coming back when we had more to spend in the future.

Go elsewhere. Mandalay Bay has a VERY nice buffet, affordable too, with extremely nice people working for them. Choose them instead. Stay away from the uppity Mirage."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most disgusting food I have ever seen at a buffet. I know its under $20 but there is a reason for that. Nobody smiles, the place is a mess, nothing is filled up properly and once you are up close to the selections, you realize there isnt much there. 

Most of the food was inedible. I basically ate cheese, crackers and salami, along with the stir-fry  veggies. Everything else was gross and a waste. 

I cannot stress enough what a waste of money this place is. Please eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many, many times over the years. It was once my favorite buffet. Today we arrived at 4:00 PM, just as dinner was starting, so it was crowded. I was using my Las Vegas Advisor 2-for-1 coupon (not a free coupon book-- I paid $37 for the book), and was hoping to also use MLife points to pay for the remainder of the meal-- but they wouldn't let me use both (even though I have over $100 in points for using my new MLife Mastercard). I was ticked, but went ahead and paid my $31.99 for dinner. I wish I wouldn't have bothered. 

We usually go for lunch, but thought that there would be more to choose from for dinner-- we were wrong. They did have crab legs, but they were so small that it took too much work to make them worthwhile. They didn't have smoked salmon, which was disappointing as that's one of my favorites and they always have it at lunchtime-- I asked and was told that they don't serve it at dinner. So basically, it was the same food for $8 more. My husband had to hunt to find enough to make a meal out of. The Asian section is really weak. The prime rib was OK. There was absolutely nothing special to justify the price of this buffet. The desserts were nothing spectacular at all-- in fact, a fairly skimpy selection once you eliminate the no-sugar-added stuff. The raspberry sorbet was pretty good, but that was about it for the dessert section. I do love the cappuccino at the end of the meal.

I never thought I would feel so negatively about the Mirage's buffet, but I doubt we'll be going back again for a long time. You have to serve yourself your own beverages, and the beverage section is in a rather inconvenient location. There is no real wait staff to bring you extra napkins or utensils,and they take forever to clear the tables off. Honestly, I haven't felt this disappointed in a buffet in a long, long time. You can go to the Fiesta Henderson and for $7.49 be treated like a king. We went to the Palms last week and had a great buffet for around $10. I know that most people are being held captive on the Strip, but it would be worth the car rental fee to have a car and drive to the outlying casinos to eat. They seem to appreciate the business, and the food is every bit as good, if not better. I have no desire to go back to the Mirage. And I was so disgusted with this whole thing that I did not stop and gamble a cent. We just walked straight out the door. Totally disappointing!!"}
{"text":"Came here on memorial day and i.must say the food was absolutely bland. I tried every food here and the only thing I liked was the potstick and pizza. All the meat were unflavored. I am Vietnamese by the way and I tried their Pho and it was an embarassment for them to serve that. Its not authenthic at all. Desserts were okay but it was on memorial day so it cost more than usual. It was basically 38$ per person. Definately noth worth it. Rather go to McDonalds or anything else. Such a high class hotel but bland food. Won't ever try this place again!"}
{"text":"Not an excellent buffet for the price of $34 a person when I can go to other hotels in walking distance. If you don't want the 50$ buffet credit to go to waste then go for it but otherwise not worth the price. Food was kind of stale, food sections spread out throughout the whole buffet making it a hassle to get from seat to food to other food."}
{"text":"Meh! I would choose the Harrah's buffet. We had a table of 12 and we all had to pay 18% gratuity, which was understandable since there was 12 of us. The only issue is the service. So on top of having to get our own food (which is normal, it's a buffet) we have to get our drinks from the bar?! I've been to multiple buffets on the strip and not once have I had to keep getting up to enjoy the bottomless mimosas. All the server did was pick up our dirty plates. And not only did we have to keep getting up, the bartender put less than half in the cup. Ah! Also, before I placed my order with the bartender, a girl in front of me ordered two drinks and he gave it to her with no problem..I ordered a mimosa for myself and my boyfriend and was told \"I can't really do this. This is the last time\"...the woman before me didn't get that speech"}
{"text":"Get there around 10:30 and you get the best of both worlds-- the end of breakfast and transition into lunch. If you like grazing on multiple foods all at once, until your stomach explodes, than this place is right up your alley. YEAH FATTY EAT UP!!            I waddled outta there well satiated.

Good- If you can't find something to eat here, you will just have to go gambling hungry than- won't you? :P I mean really, it isn't meant to be 5 star dining people. Get ReAL!!! It's a decent spread tho and quite the mix of americanized pseudo-foreign cuisine. $16 will make you holla for TUMS or your mommy.

Bad- Not sure what the wait was about cause the restaurant was half empty when I went, but whatevs. Stay away from the fruit. It is not fresh!

Ugly- No room in my lil tummy for more MACAROONS!!!"}
{"text":"Food was not good at all and it was cold! We paid $34 per person which is not cheap for brunch."}
{"text":"Shoddy, boring, inept.  For such a great property to serve such a lackluster Mothers Day brunch is a real disappointment.  No bagels (\"well you can put some cream cheese on some toast or a roll\" said the manager).  Crab legs served frozen solid (we can put them in the steamer for you - another great idea from the manager).

No thanks.  I was hoping for it to served the way it was intended: refreshingly chilled.

To his credit he offered to pay our brunch tab.  That's okay, we're comped anyway.  What would have gone a long way is an admittance to being short on supplies, and not lame excuses.  This is the Mirage, after all - and not some off-the-strip hotel's breakfast bar.

2 stars for excellent beverage service served up by a delightful lady.  The rest was as empty and void as the scrambled eggs - of which there were none as well."}
{"text":"So I spent the $ to go here. I felt that the food was ok but not that great. The crab legs were cut into to the point that u could hardy  get any meat out felt that hey we're stingy on them and they also were doing construction at the time so I'm sure we're missing out on a few items  that were not getting.  The all u can drink beer is the only thing I can say was the highlight of my experience here as I couldn't give them 5 stars. Cause I kinda felt ripped off. But if u have lots of time to sit and eat and mess with half ass crab legs. Go ahead. !"}
{"text":"For the price this food was not worth it. The soup with clam was very salty. The clam chowder also very salty. The chicken pasta was edible but not great the so called sushi is a joke its just california roll. I had buy one get one free and it was still not worth it. The cakes are hard. Yuck. Go somewhere else! Never coming back. Only ate here cause we saw \"Love\" which was excellent!"}
{"text":"For a resort hotel such as the Mirage, we were expecting a much better selection in the buffet.  Came here mainly for the crab legs.  Very disappointed in which they are carved/split in half.  This makes for less meat in the shell as well as harder to pick out with your fork.  As for the rest of the buffet?  It's a buffet.  Not very impressed.  The usual.  Egg rolls.  Buffet sushi.  Buffet chicken.  Buffet  noodles. The Creme Brûlée was embarrassing for this place.  It was runny like watered down pudding. Etc, etc, etc....  Won't waist our money here again.  Unless we want the free drinks which are complementary in this buffet."}
{"text":"This was probably the third time we ate @ this buffet. The experience was still the same AMAZING!  The food was delicious & the service excellent!  Champagne brunch totally worth it!  We got a food deal off of travelzoo $26 for two people champagne brunch.  We brought  a large group of 15 & they seated us pretty quickly. The best buffet in Vegas ! Great variety !"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Mirage and since we were all really tired from our first day here, we decided to give it a try. We came here for dinner on a Saturday night and we were seated right away.

My first impression with this place was that it is very expensive. I believe it was almost $40 a person. I thought the food selection was going to have some good specials and options for that price. Boy was I wrong...I was very disappointed as soon as I walked around and realized that there isn't anything special. In fact, everything they served there you could get at any buffet for more than half the price. The seafood selection was lacking many things that you would normally expect for a $40.00 buffet. There were no crab legs and they had very little shrimp entrees to choose from. On top of that, everything here tasted just okay. Definitely not worth the price!

The only thing that was good about this buffet was the fact that they had so many different types of food to chose from. Also, they did have a lot of selection, but nothing special at all. I will definitely not come back here in my future visit to Vegas and I do not recommend this place to anyone, unless they have different rates for lunch."}
{"text":"No bueno. They charge a service fee but service is non existent!! They don't serve you so you have to go get your own drink, our server didn't pick up our plates for a long time and they were piling up so we put them on another table then she noticed and picked them up. We kept doing this during the whole meal. 

We brought everything to the manager's attention and she told us they were understaffed and they were doing the best they could! 

The food is not tasty and it's all very subpar. Disappointing but they're digging their own grave."}
{"text":"The worst quality on buffet food ever.   The only thing that the ones eating with me liked was the pasta made at your desire. 

Service OK."}
{"text":"Blech!  This was terrible.  School cafeteria and food at grandmas nursing home is better.  Everything looked like it had been sitting forever.  What we did try was barely warm. Save your money - you'd be better off at McDonald's."}
{"text":"Free house wine and draft beer makes the 29.99 a person worth it. The food was decent and had a good selection. Dessert was great, the pumpkin blondies were my husband and myself's favorite. Would definitely come again to get a good buzz going for a decent price on the strip."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good buffet to take kids or teens to, go here.  If it's just you and a significant other, go somewhere nicer.  

The food was good - we went on Sunday at 3pm and they were still serving brunch so there were a lot of pancake and egg dishes out which isn't really my thing.

The Chinese food was delicious, not a huge selection, but crazy good.

Awesome green salads - they make them the way they're made at Pluto's in California.  You choose the ingredients, they toss it.  Excellent.

And crab legs and shrimp cocktail - cold and fresh, all you can eat?  Well that was worth the price alone.

It's a buffet but a server brings your drinks. 

Awesome, easy free parking behind the Mirage - just take the side street by Treasure Island, drive back to the Mirage, park and walk in.  Once in the Mirage, go through the atrium / jungle area and follow the signs to the buffet."}
{"text":"Horrible, the food is seriously flavorless. How do they use SO much pepper but still can't get a lick of flavor in the food? Their version of Cajun is atrocious and embarrassing. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. My husband literally said on the way out that it was the worst $60 he has ever spent.

Service- it's 100% self serve, you get your own drinks and your plates sit on your table till you leave or until you start giving super dirty looks to all the servers around you. Also the carpet is absolutely disgusting in here!

The price is ridiculous for what mediocre food you get and especially it being completely flavorless. The prime rib wasn't even salted.

At the end of our meal we were nearly furious seeing as NOTHING had flavor at all."}
{"text":"Food selection was not impressive. (2stars) food was cold.  The pasta bar was a bad experience (1star). Asked the guy about spaghetti and meatballs and he said no more meatballs, i asked him how long ,he said 5min and i said ok ill come back.  5min i come back and he is gone. What an A -hole . Basically he told me 5 min cause he was leaving his shift.  That was dick move and he didnt seem like he wanted to be there and he seemed like he wanted to serve females....  Very expensive at $40 per person if u dont drink. Wont be coming back."}
{"text":"A good middle-tier Vegas buffet.  The buffets on the Strip cost anywhere from $10-$38 throughout the day.  My family came for weekend brunch which runs from 8 am - 3 pm and is a decent deal at $19 for a wide variety of breakfast and lunchtime fare.  I loved that the space was super-clean and the service was friendly.  We were comfortable dining there for 2 hours.  Hey, gotta get our money's worth!  Of the stuff I tried, the better items were the prime rib, shrimp cocktail, wonton noodles and the CHOCOLATE GELATO.  The stuff I'd skip would be the crab legs (over-cooked), sushi (mostly rice and it's dry), dim sum (average) and the wonton dumplings (taste like they were frozen)."}
{"text":"Ok, the previous dining experience must have been because we were partially hung over or something. The quality of the food was not as good this time. Variety was all right...."}
{"text":"My favorite buffet in Las Vegas...I've had several and still like this one the best."}
{"text":"this place is okay, just your average buffet with average food-- nothing amaaaazing. came here with my family of 9 and didn't want to wait in line so came around 5:30. the line wasn't too bad. when we left around 6:45, there was a line forming but didn't look too bad for a Vegas buffet (compared to the 2 hour wait at Caesars!). 

the beverages are self serve, sodas and coffee. there's a bar where the wine is complimentary (getting pretty standard for Vegas buffet now). the buffet area is maintained pretty well considering how busy it was. the pasta station took a while, but the chefs behind were friendly. 
the servers (or busers ) and hostesses were very friendly. for dinner, paid I think around $35. wouldn't ever go out of my way to eat here or recommend this place specifically, but wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Great staff. Nice atmosphere, food was mediocre.. even by buffet standards.. The appearance/presentation  ( much like everything in Vegas) was ok, but the taste.. egh.. I've had much better for about half the price.  Sushi rice was overcooked, nori was too stiff, no flavor to the ahi or shrimp.Prime rib was grey.. wtf????  They had some dried out looking rotissiere chicken and other foods that really just looked like Hometown Buffet fare.. But on the yum side, there was a lovely citrus fennel salad on a bed of baby spinach that was fresh and chilled properly. Also had some of their lemon sorbet which was nice for the hot day. 
 For $22.95  ...it was too much tho.. not on my list of places to return to."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and it has never disappointed.  The buffet has a wide variety of food choices, and all food is at the appropriate temperature.  If you love peel and eat shrimp you will enjoy the fact that the shrimp is already peeled and they are plump and tasty.  The salad bar has a vast selection of toppings and all vegetables are fresh.  Make sure to stop by the BBQ area;  great sauce and tender ribs.  We went to the buffet mid week for dinner and the price was $32.00 per person (with tax).  This is an excellent bargain for really good food at a casino on the strip. Oh, did I mention that the price includes beer and/or wine!  Sounding even better now, right?I took off a star because of the service; or the new lack of service.  They no longer take your drink order;  there is a fountain area where you pour your own.  When I asked the \"wait staff\" where I could get lemons for my ice tea he pointed me in the direction of the seafood (nowhere near the drink area).  Really, you couldn't go get them for me?  Your lack of service was reflected in your tip;  you can get it over by the seafood!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family before seeing LOVE at the Mirage, the day of my dad and step-mom's wedding!

We were starving and this buffet really hit the spot. There was a pretty good salad bar with some charcuterie and tons of breads.

The unlimited beer/wine was nice, but there was only one craft beer on tap, which was disappointing. However they DID have one, so I can't complain TOO much!

My favorite plate was the roast turkey, mashed potatoes and gravy. I even went back for seconds which is rare at buffets. 

The dessert section was very good as well! Of course, we had a wedding cake too so I left COMPLETELY stuffed. 

I only awarded 4 stars to Cravings because it wasn't totally awesome, but everyone in the party liked it, no one had any complaints and we would come back again. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's called \"Cravings\" because you crave better food when you leave.

My opinion on the buffets in Vegas is you get what you pay for. That being said, we opted to try the buffet here because we didn't want to wait in a 1-2 hour line at the Wynn. 

I had been here only once before, about 6 years ago, and since then, they changed a lot.. from what I remember, anyway. We came around 7 and had to wait maybe 20 minutes to get seated. I liked how everything was spread out, so it was really easy to get what you wanted, and move on. The rice pilaf was really good, along with their meat. My friend and I thought it was awesome that they had a panini and gyro guy who would make you one to order. I immediately decided on a turkey and cheese panini. After waiting about 5 minutes for someone to come help us, a man who barely spoke english grumbled that we get what he makes us, and put together a sloppy-looking panini with ham, cheese, onion, and some pesto. After all of the hassle it took to get one, the sandwich didn't taste all that great. Their spinach-artichoke dip was also not a winner with us. Too much spinach, not enough flavor. You really do get what you pay for, so I wasn't expecting too much out of it. Can't say I was really surprised."}
{"text":"They had a drink station. They labeled their types of the (I.e.  Asian, Latin, Italian.) The crab wasn't all that good but I liked their other food. Their dessert was great, though."}
{"text":"For the price of $21.99 per person and the fact that it is unlimited beer and wine and unlimited food I would say that this place is a bargain. If you are looking for fine dining with exquisite flavors do not bother with this place. But if you are hungry and will eat anything then come check it out. Remember, this place is buffet so I am not reviewing the flavors, just the price and what that entails. The food wasnt horrible but nothing struck me as 'delish!!'"}
{"text":"The only things edible in this place are corns and crab legs. Yes you have unlimited drink&wine but the quality was so low that I'd rather pay to get some more decent ones. Other bad examples I remember: the vege with huge leaves (don't know it's name) was like presoaked with some chemicals to keep it from rotten. Sushi rice was undercooked. Beef rib was tasteless and not well cooked - what a waste for such a big chunk of meat. Wonton soup was full of msg so good luck with your stomach 2 hours after you drink it."}
{"text":"This may just be my favorite vegas buffet, we came this past weekend thanks to myvegas rewards the food is awesome everything is nice and fresh. The jumbo shrimp is amazing, crab legs are delicious, sopes are great. I didn't try anything that I didn't like. The best and my most favorite part is the desserts. Tiramisu, creme brulee, cupcakes, donuts, pana cotta all incredible I will go back every chance we get the bottomless mimosas, beer and wine make lunch extra fun as well"}
{"text":"To be honest, I was only impressed by the prime rib.  But a man cannot live on prime rib alone.  Everything else was just meh.  As usual, they have various types of food but there really wasn't that much of a selection at each station.  Price was a couple bucks more than the TI buffet next door which I felt was way better.  Ambiance wise, it felt more like a cafeteria than other buffets I have been to.  The sodas were way watered down too.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"So I made it for dinner before the dinner crowd arrived, which meant there weren't much of a wait at all.
Drinks at this buffet are all self-serve, except beer and wine, which you have to request from the bartender who pours it for you. They have the cool soft drink dispensers with the electronic screen which is neat because it offers a wide selection! I only made my way to the alcohol though. It may be cheap wine, but I didn't care since it was included with the price.
As far as the food goes, it was definitely a flop. Selection was also very limited. I had a hard time finding things I actually wanted to try.
All of their poultry offerings including the roast turkey, cajun chicken, fried chicken etc were beyond dry. I had to save it with cranberry sauce, gravy, or simply eat it with the mac and cheese. Their mac and cheese was one of the few selections which were very good.
Crabs legs were extremely salty. I got three pieces and could barely finish them. 
The pasta dishes were overcooked but it's to be expected at a buffet. Pasta is usually good fresgly prepared and eaten right away. The cheese ravioli I had here was ok. 
The asian station had bao filled with shrimp which was weird. They had a weird stir-fry, chow mein noodles and the rest were empty. The sushi were the typical grocery store selections of cali rolls and other rolls with imitation crab or cream cheese.
The tamales from the mexican section had no flavor. It was simply salty. Costco sells a pack of tamales that are so much better. How sad is that?
I was at the buffet with a friend who was enjoying his shrimp and crablegs and that was basically all he really wanted. 
I quickly got bored with dry meat and limited selection. The deserts werent even good. I simply sat and waited while filling up on endless wine. It may be cheap wine but hey, it's included with this buffet and that deserves two stars. I ended up having dinner elsewhere at a sit-down restaurant a couple hours later, as the buffet was really gross."}
{"text":"Desserts were terrible, let's see, should I start here?  Nevermind, it was like 28-30 bucks each, all 10 were split up and, and, and, ah forget it, don't bother......."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed this buffet. All of the food was delicious. The curry chicken and dumplings were so so yummy. Moving from the Asian section to the Latin section for round 2 and had delicious fajitas, bean soup, rice and tortilla chips. The salsas were also full of flavor. We also wanted to try the Italian section but we could only handle a slice of pizza as we were already stuffed but the pizza was great. They also have a spot where a chef will cook the pasta of your choice in front of you which is really neat. The drinks included unlimited wine, beer, and soda which was great. We ended this yummy buffet with a great selection of deserts. Oh and the man who was clearing our tables was very impressive!"}
{"text":"my friends and i seem to hit up this buffet everytime we're in vegas. definitely a decent buffet with loads to choose from. they have a lot of seafood...shrimp cocktail and crab legs are definitely a staple. they even have gelato!"}
{"text":"Great Experience. We whole heartedly approve. Unlimited mimosas, wine and beer (if you like that). Plenty of self serve drink stations, so never have to worry about finding a server to refill. Staff is very attentive. It is laid out well. It may not have all the crazy weird foods like east Asian Grupper smelt like the Hipsters think is good food, but it has everything that a good Sunday, Las Vegas champagne brunch buffet should have. One of my favorites. Anyone that does not like this, has never been to a true Las Vegas buffet. The Mirage still has it going on!"}
{"text":"Too pricy for a vegan. They don't have that option. Had a bowl of salad. Fantastic salad but rest was blah. Horrible Asian selection. Kimchi & tofu soup was okay but Italian & rest was hohum. Seafood stunk. Meat platters were disgusting to look at but what am I to do with a family of 10. I was out voted. If they had vegan choice at 1/2 price I wouldn't be giving them 1 star. $35 for small bowl of greens is just too much."}
{"text":"This is one of the few buffets that my classmates and I have not tried so we came and visited it one day after class.  It was around 12pm and we were starving! The line to pay wasn't long, but we waited about 5-10 minutes to get seated.  I was pretty impressed with the selection at this place.  I hated the lunch buffet at Green Valley, Mandalay Bay, and Planet Hollywood, so I expected this buffet to be completely disappointing.  I'm glad they proved me wrong!!

Their sushi spread wasn't that great.  They had two platters full of tiny little sushi rolls.  But they had a bunch of stations that I seriously couldn't even get to because I was so full!! They served crab legs and oysters in one end, and BBQ tri tip and filet slices on the other.  Their pasta station wasn't that great though, all they had that day was spaghetti with meatballs. Their dessert station was okay.  Their sugar free stuff did not taste very good but their gelatos, chocolate pastries, and cookies were yummy!  

It was still a good experience. Another buffet to check off my list.  I only have two more months left here in Vegas, and I have 2-3 more casino buffets to hit up before leaving!"}
{"text":"What a great buffet! 
I had breakfast here and anything and everything I wanted or could even think I might want for breakfast was available. The drinks are included in the price which makes this place an incredible value for breakfast! The service was good, the hot food was hot, the cold food was cold, nothing looked old or had been sitting too long, the fruit was fresh and the assortment of everything was awesome!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard buffet for Vegas.  My husband and I came here for lunch on the day we checked in at the Mirage and got in towards the end of the lunch rush.  The food was already starting to get cold and the variety was dwindling.  We were hungry so we ate what we needed to eat before we hit the strip.

I wish we would have waited and came another day when the food was fresher and more plentiful.  The one thing that I can not resist is dessert and this place did a great job in providing options.  You can never go wrong with hitting someones sweet tooth I loved the presentation and taste.

Our server (forgot her name) was also amazing!

PROs:  Dessert!, very nice people (from check-in to servers), bottomless beer/wine

CONs:  Lukewarm/cold Food, dwindling variety



I'll be going back to Vegas next month and I always do 1 buffet on each visit.  I'll have to do a walk through to check the food before I choose this place again"}
{"text":"Don't pay full price to eat here or anywhere on the strip. Get a discount from Tix 4 Tonight. We paid $21 an adult with discount. I was really hungry and chowed down on fried chicken, ribs, bok choy, king crab, shrimp, pizza, sushi, Chinese, and dessert. I was stuffed and had a stomach ache. The drink station is generous with a whole list of drinks that included several different flavors of Minute Maid lemonade."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here about 4-5 years ago while staying at the Mirage. We only ate here for Breakfast but it was very tasty and filling. I love breakfast so I was in heaven with all of the various options on the line. The service was pretty standard and nothing memorable.

Great place to eat breakfast if you are hungry!"}
{"text":"To date the best buffet we've had and they have complementary beer and wine for dinner. Most places do not have such exquisite selection of food to select from. Most of the cuisine is prepared freashly in each section. If you're here you should try it."}
{"text":"We went here three times during our Vegas stay, twice for breakfast and once for lunch. At first I thought it was kind of pricey, but after seeing other menus in Vegas I realized it was a good deal. It was nice to fill up in the mornings and not worry about eating for awhile. Considering the fact that coffee and juice are included in the price it was worth it...I would have had to buy a $4 coffee somewhere else.

Hey have lots of variety. Their Latin section was really yummy and their freshly sliced ham is amazing. I left happy and full every time."}
{"text":"I really felt this buffet was too pricy for the food that was offered. I expected to be overwhelmed with amazing dishes that made me want to go back for seconds and thirds. This was not the case. Instead, I found this place to be average, at best. I really love the Mirage and just so sad that the buffet didn't meet my expectations. 

Our server, I forgot his name, was awesome! He was friendly and helpful, but the station cooks were kinda cranky. Totally not the vibe I want on my vacation! 

I'm giving it three stars only because Cravings offers all you can drink beer and house wine. So if you drink for a couple hours, it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Ended up at this place because my MIL went on a museum tour and this place was recommended by the tour guide. We walked in and when my hubby busted out the credit card to pay and showed his ID (military), we ended up with a very generous discount! Liking the place already! We were seated, then went hunting for food. 

Loved that there was an unlimited beer and wine bar - that included Moscato, which is my favorite wine! Me, being the big seafood lover, made a beeline straight to the crab and shrimp section. I also went by the carving station where they have both medium rare and well done prime rib, which is a nice touch. I perused around the other sections before sitting down, everything looked pretty good but my plate can only hold so much! 

The prime rib (medium rare) was great and loved the shrimp with cocktail sauce, as well as the shrimp ceviche. The crab was ok, some pieces had some dry spots but edible. Loved the cioppino, reminded me of my own mother's version of her seafood soup. I also tried the clam chowder but it was rather bland and a bit watery to my liking. But other than that, the food was overall surprisingly good, and the service was excellent. I have a feeling the hubby and I will be back if we visit Las Vegas again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite buffets in Vegas and I can say it satisfied my hunger cravings!!!! FOOD PORN, FOODgasm, and FOOD coma all in one! haha..where else can you get that kind of treatment?! 

What a way to grab people's attention, by displaying several tv screens showing yummy concoctions of FOOOOD from succulent desserts to an array of dishes for meat and seafood lovers...all in slo-mo at the entrance while you wait (hopefully patiently) in line to get in. What a major tease I tell ya, but it's worth it!!! 

The lineup of food was immense and catered to all my friends who had different tastes in food..from the health nuts to the mad, carnivore meat and potatoes kind. haha. We all were in complete awe of every station.

To my amazment, they had all my favs in one setting: seaweed salad, crab legs, ceviche, sushi, hand rolls, good quality kimchee, dim sum, pho, and all the fresh fruit and gelato you want! Mmmm....me want more! LOL! I'm getting excited just typing all this. =p

..at the end of our meals with happy bellies, we wobbled out looking forward to reuniting once again in the near future."}
{"text":"The layout of where the food is too far apart. I also really don't like drinking off plastic cups. In the past the mirage buffet was pretty good now it's going towards Excalibur circus style buffet. Especially with the plastic Pizza Hut cups. The only reason I decided to come here because I didn't want to wait four hours for the Caesars one. What a mistake I should've waited. Also the food has no taste at all. And what's with the free wine? Is it to make people gamble all there money away when they step into the casino. It makes the buffet look trashy. I would only come back here if it's free or super deal like 2 for 1 price."}
{"text":"Went there last weekend for a brunch buffet of $18.95. There are many kinds of ethnic food stations. My favorite are the prime rib, crab legs, shrimp cocktail and baked seafood. The pho station is particularly interesting because you can order a combination of beef pho with wonton or even chinese roast duck. The traffic is light so we did not have to stand in line at all. This buffet may not be as good as the Wynn or the Bellagio but it is the best food you can get in Vegas for under $20."}
{"text":"Pro tip: Try and grab one of the cravings buffet vouchers from the tix4tonight booth across the street! For $2 you get a voucher that ends up saving you something like 1/3 - 1/2 of your bill ~$10 off. 

Overall this was definitely a decent buffet for the strip. Everything was decent quality, but don't expect that to be synonymous with authentic. 

For example, the sushi. First, woo hoo, there's sushi!! But I'm not even sure how you physically pack rice so tightly. Biting into the rice of nigiri was like biting into a sausage. 

Some of the pasta from the italian station also tasted like the marina sauce came from a can. 

But beyond a couple dishes, mostly everything was in the 3.5 stars and above range. There was also a fairly large variety of dishes to choose from. 

It seems that cravings is willing to spend the money on decent food, and they include beer and wine. I think their focus should be on now improving the authenticity of cuisine and maybe even going beyond to offer drinks like thai ice tea and a wider variety of desserts like crepes or sticky rice with mango. 

That would definitely get cravings noticed and differentiate them the rest on the strip."}
{"text":"Got there just before the change over.  So we got lunch at breakfast price.  Cravings did not disappoint as usual.  Good selection.  The beef & Broccoli was very tender."}
{"text":"A lot to choose from. They try and have a little bit of everything for every ethnic groups. Huge selection of food for a reasonable price. Nothing is that good though, it's pretty much buffet quality, don't expect too much."}
{"text":"Could be worse.  Seems as though the food grows progressively more disappointing.  When I was younger--by younger, I mean early elementary--the place was alway packed with people, and the food was actually nod-worth for a buffet.  I haven't been to the buffet inside of Caesar's in years, but back then, Caesar's food was worse than Mirage's.  If you don't eat a whole lot (ex. me), you might grow a bit bored after a plate, but the environment makes family dining much more relaxed than at most other places."}
{"text":"This is a good, standard buffet. Don't expect it to be fancy like Wicked Spoon and Bachannal. We came on a Friday for dinner at 5pm. I had a myVEGAS 2 for 1 voucher. $35 with tax. Sweet. It wasn't packed and not busy. Fast & friendly service. I had some seafood fish items, crab claws & legs, prime rib, beef brisket, fish & chips, pork ribs, chow mein, potstickers, salmon nigiri, seaweed salad, broccolini, and desserts. The highlights were the prime rib, fish with spinach, crab claws, pork ribs and desserts. Do not get the cream brûlée. The rest were ok and standard. The sushi selections are not so great. Need more Japanese food selections. Love how wine and beer is included in the buffet price. I had a glass of Chardonnay. The buffet price is not too expensive. Definitely worth the amount of food I ate. Will come back again and dine here. Thanks."}
{"text":"All in all, the aesthetics are really nice, lots of lux gold and mood lighting. The layout of the buffet is really convenient and it gives you a good view of all of the different cultures of foods that are offered here! Everything from fishmonger, Classic Italian, Asian even beer and wines! The quality of the foods is what's keeping this a 4 star instead of a 5. The verity really is a huge bonus! I got spicy streamed broccoli, and also pad Thai noodles . The shining gem in this buffet is definitely the desert bar! Holy cow! The selection is fantastic and the quality is prime. I had a very fresh and sweet fruit tart and raspberry sorbet also a Nutella moose shooter, I was definitely pleased. In the end I wouldn't come here. But seems how the meal was free for me I can't complain too much!"}
{"text":"One of my buffet peeves is initially sitting down and waiting for a server so you can order your drinks. My peeve came true here as we were sitting a good 5mins before our server came to ask about drinks. The food is just ok, highlights include the salad bar (you tell the server what you want and they mix it up for you), the crab legs were a good size, and the shrimp was already peeled. Other than that, it was a big pile of meh. The sushi, if you can call it that, was absolutely sad...little rolls of something that only half-resembled what you would buy at a cheapo convenience store. The asian section was blech, the pizza was ok if you prefer two inches of crust, and the rolls were hard. I used to like this buffet but it's just not the greatest. I'm giving it three stars as it is better than the one at Harrah's and I would still eat there if I was hankering for crab legs, but there are better options out there."}
{"text":"As anyone can tell from my reviews, most of my time in Vegas is spent around a buffet table.  We were staying at the Mirage and decided to go downstairs to the buffet for breakfast.  We got there around 9:30 and there was no line for a Monday morning.  The inside of Cravings felt a little stuffy as it seemed like it was in the middle of the casino floor.  The décor was definitely a no fuss but that did not matter so much to me since all I wanted to do was eat food.  There was an omelet station, which was provided ready made omelets.  The guy who was making them was fast and quick and it tasted really good.  However, I did not really enjoy anything else.  The potatoes and eggs did not taste fresh and felt that it was sitting out.  Instead of trying another food item, I just got another omelet and paired it with some fresh fruit.  

I also saw the dessert area, which was surprisingly pretty big.  I tried a cookie from there and it was pretty tasty.  Overall, I think that the buffet's food is 2 stars, but I upped one star for omelet and the dessert area."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch on 2nd day of vegas. I was not impressed with the selection. I mostly only ate prime rib. They had a very small buffet with not many offerings. It does include unlimited house beer and wine which was great."}
{"text":"We went to Cravings for a breakfast/lunch as we had two comped tickets, we are not exactly buffet fanatics so we didn't know what to expect. I must say we were pleasantly surprised by this experience as considering the buffet is cheaper than many others in Vegas the quality was still pretty good especially if you consider that it includes also unlimited drink (sodas, wine and beer).

There are different stations with different types of cuisine and there's also a cook making omelettes to your taste.

The oriental section was good with a nice selection of sushi (that add more variety than other renowned buffets like the Bellagio).

The only disappointment was the dessert station that had a very limited choice compared to other buffets.

Definitely interesting the chance to pay a lower price for a take out option.

If you're looking for a mid-range priced buffet, Cravings is definitely reccomended."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the buffet at the Mirage since before it was renovated and renamed Cravings.  I joined a friend from out of town tonight for dinner.

We were pleased with our dinner.  The design is so much more friendly than the old set up.  The only thing I thought was that the seating looked almost like diner seats but that didn't matter.

There is a wide variety of stations from which to choose.There are: Italian, carving, Rotisserie, Latin, Raw Bar, Fishmonger, Noodles, Chinese, Salad, and Desserts.  Those are the names on the lights at each of the areas.

Standouts tonight were the asparagus, lobster bisque soup--better than what I had recently at a high end Strip restaurant, the ravioli, and the desserts.  I mark them down because their prime rib that was supposed to be rare was more medium than rare even though she cut into a new piece.  I could have told her to cut in the middle, but she took from the end.

The dessert selection was nice.  I had some red velvet cake, a cookie, and the newest serving idea--a chocolate shaped mini tea/coffee cup filled with chocolate mousse and topped with whipped cream.

Service was very good.  In fact I had to stop her from refilling my iced tea so many times because I was going to a show and I didn't want to have to leave in the middle for a bathroom break.

The buffet is priced a little less than the highest rated ones and I can see why.  I can see myself coming back sometime."}
{"text":"This place came recommended by many as the buffet with the best value food-cost wise. 25 bucks for dinner on the weekday. For my first round, I got the beef roast from the carving station, shrimps, crab legs, fish (cod and bass), sweet potato fries, and a salmon skin roll. The beef was delicious but a bit over processed or too tenderized. And you can't really choose how much it's cooked. They just slice you off a piece. And I love sweet potato fried but these were just ok. The crab was too salty for me. Next I got a bowl of pho and wonton noodle soup from the noodles station as well as some porridge/congee from the Asian station. Yeah I know I'm very Asian. They were piping hot and so tasty. The bowls are weird though so you can't put too much in there without it spilling. I couldn't eat too much after that so I went to the desserts, getting some fruit and gelato. I love that they have their own display case of gelato - about 8 different flavors worth. There's so many other stations too - pizza/Italian, Mexican, seafood, Asian, carving, salad, cold foods, noodle, and desserts. Something for everyone. 

I also came here for champagne brunch a couple years ago and it was amazing. We stayed for hours, enjoying the food and out mimosas. Also a good price for good food."}
{"text":"Oh, Lord.  We stayed here for three hours.  Maybe it's because I haven't been to a Vegas buffet in a while, but I was impressed.  The food is constantly refreshed, and it's very clean.  Everything is separated into categories.  The food is labeled very clearly.  And they have many gluten free options which are also clearly labeled (a big relief to my wife).  Crab legs with the shells split and ready to eat.  Breakfast burritos with tomatillo salsa, eggs benny, carved meats, omelettes made to order, biscuits and gravy, a HUGE dessert selection of bite-sized beauties, and FREE BEER, WINE & MIMOSAS!
If your idea of a good time is eating many courses of different foods over an extended period of time, you'll love it here.  

The weak points are:  
The mimosas are made with the cheapest sparkling wine possible (to be expected, I guess).  
The wine I'm sure is of equal quality, but we didn't bother anyway.
The salad bar is small and lacking in choices.  I'm probably the only who goes for salad at a $40 buffet, but there it is."}
{"text":"Pretty dang expensive buffet. That being said unlimited beer/wine/cappucino flavored coffee. Awesome crab legs, shrimp, sushi, mashed potatoes, tamales, made to order pasta, chow mein, cous cous, italian food, chinese, carved meats, mexican-you get the idea great variety. I don't usually like buffets but I thought this was pretty good food/variety."}
{"text":"This buffet has a nice selection, and it's convenient for hotel guests. But if I didn't stay here, I would not make a trip to come here."}
{"text":"I went to this buffet cause price was reasonable and they had a wide variety of different foods and including breakfast that was a bonus. Everything was great except wish they had more food choice options in each nationality catergory for the brunch times. But i would still recommend this place for quality of food. Workers were all very nice and helpful too."}
{"text":"Good beer and wine included with dinner... Unlimited. Food was really good and people are friendly."}
{"text":"i was looking for a quick option for breakfast while walking on the casino floor in the mirage.  i ate breakfast here on 10-26-14 around 8 am.  there was no wait and i was seated immediately.

i guess this particular buffet offers FREE wine, beer, and mimosa.  kinda early to have a drink.  depending on what you put on your plate could range in quality from 2-3 star quality of food.  it wasn't gross per se but was just below okay quality.  because i paid for my food i felt personally obligated to consume the food.  lol.  my french toast was soggy.  my bacon was cardboard like.  my breakfast burrito wasn't bad.  the chicken fried steak was about 2 days old.  the non alcoholic drinks are self-served.

the service was 3-star and my breakfast buffet was approximately $34.  i don't plan on going back, ever."}
{"text":"This used to be one of the most amazing buffets in Vegas--about 10 years ago.  They still have the amazing Chimichurri and some really good brisket but I miss the hand rolls and the fabulous Rhum Babas and gelato they used to have.  This place has really gone downhill.  It makes me very sad.  We had a 2 for 1 thanks to MyVegas.com Slots or we might not have even eaten here."}
{"text":"Ok, buffet but not outstanding.  It was easy in and easy out, but the choices seemes somewhat limited.  My wife did not like the freshness or the the seasoning of the  crab here.  Probably a good choice with coupon for Breakfast or Lunch, but you can do better."}
{"text":"Super fun buffet. Free drinks, ten different stations. My favorite was the sushi station! Very well organized and clean. Low price compared to most buffets. Overall a very fun vibe, everyone loves coming here! DIY pasta station! Italian, Latin, Asian, meat, seafood, Mexican, salad, dessert, and a bar. I stayed as long as I could and eventually left because the air conditioning was making me too cold!"}
{"text":"This was my first buffet experience in Vegas by way of a tix 4 tonight kiosk (definitely go there for discount buffet and show tickets). My husband and I did a champagne brunch and the champagne flowed, the crab legs and shrimp were abundant and the food was good overall. Our waitress was very nice and attentive and kept our glasses full. I would definitely return on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Oh I really enjoy this buffet....

In the past I never really enjoyed the buffet at Mirage, but ever since Cravings buffet was established I've became a fan of this place...

The decor is sophisticated at it's best.. all the nice LCD TVs along the entry way showing a slow motion of an egg being dropped into a pile of flour.... awesome way to start a buffet!  (lots of other food related video clips for your enjoyment!)

Here are the typical review section for a buffet...

Pizza:  Pretty good.. probably about as on par as CPKs... so pizza lovers will enjoy.

Carving station:  Prime Rib and Ham.... decent prime rib as it was more red than how I've liked it, but the server was nice enough to carve the other side for me and was very attentive!  Definitely a plus!

Mexican food section:  Had some breakfast burrito but didn't taste that great.. pretty dry in preparation so decided to past on this section for the rest of the time there.

Cold seafood:  Had snow crab legs and shrimp cocktail for brunch!  Cool!  I didn't really eat too much of this because it seemed too early for me for crab legs but others were diggin this!

Hot seafood:  Had some paella, pesto cream mussels, and some salmon... they were all fair tasting.

Special metal room for fresh Chinese noodles!  This was my favorite!  A chef is inside this steel room cooking fresh noodles with the options of wonton soup or beef stew soup.... had some gyoza and also few dim sum servings (little shrimp wrapped in rice paper), all very tasty!  The best part was hot roast duck and BBQ pork to go along with the noodle soup!  YUM!!!  Definitely my favorite!

Chinese food section:  Not a big fan... bored of all the orange chicken that everyone is serving and beef with broccoli, I think I will past for sure..... (But the egg drop duck soup was very delicious!  Not salty yet sweet tasting!  Add some scallions and cilantros and you are definitely good to go here!)

Crepe station:  Fresh peach / peach cream crepe.... wow!  One of the best  crepes I've had in a while as the cream reminded me of Beard Papa's except is a little bit tarty..... but not overly sweet and just right...  Crepes were made to perfection so it turned out awesome!  Had to share it with everyone though.. couldn't finish this large chunk of heaven!

Salad station:  Skipped this because I was getting really full, but noticed that they had fresh made Paninis if requested.... so for those of you who like to take a little snack out of the buffet for later.. this option would be great as those sandwiches looked healthy and wonderful!  I'll give it a try next time!

Dessert station:  By this time I'm ready to faint..... but had to pull myself to take a look.... took a sugar free cheesecake and that's about it... not bad.....  Had to end the meal with ice cream though... so grapefruit gelato was on my menu to clean up my palate.....

Cravings...... I can't crave you anymore for today.... maybe another time....."}
{"text":"This is a foodie's heaven! I happen to stop in this weekend at the Mirage while visiting Vegas. Everyone was raving about Cravings so I said, let me check it out. Got in there and was amazed by what I saw. Brunch was about $22 per person but that included an unlimited supply of mimosas (the diva in me can't start the day without one while on the road) and an all you can eat buffet that had you sampling wares from all over the world. Great service. Great food. Definitely a must when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"We went here with a large group for both dinner and breakfast. We were disappointed both times. For dinner, there was a wide assortment of dishes, but many tasted mediocre. Breakfast was even more disappointing, with a too-long-to-stand-on omelette line, few other egg choices (they need two omelette stations and another station for regular eggs), and not enough interesting fare to warrant the cost. Worse, they charge a usurious 18% service fee for parties of 8 or more, yet they do nothing for that money--didn't offer to get drinks or water or coffee, and barely bussed the tables. Not at all worth the cost."}
{"text":"Downhill from the last time I was here 3 yrs ago.  Not a big fan of getting your own drinks.  Sunday brunch was not as good, not as fresh as before.  Thank goodness I had a bogo"}
{"text":"We went for lunch. The best thing about this buffet is the many stations, each a different type of cuisine, so lots and lots of varied choices.  Its weakness is that while some of the food is quite good, some is not.  Nice thing about a buffet, is you can just stop eating anything that turns out to be not so great and go get something else.  Standouts according to family poll on this trip were cold and hot jumbo shrimp, coleslaw, cornbread, Italian chicken stew, bok choy, carne asada, flan, and chocolate mousse cake."}
{"text":"This buffet was exactly what I wanted. Unlimited beer, champagne, mimosas and drinks with delicious food! The price was good and they had a great selection! I had the prime rib and it was cooked great and so were the breakfast items! They had a wide variety of bakery items, lunch items and it was all done perfectly! Our drinks were always full and the staff was very friendly. I will probably come back her next time I'm in Vegas and I definitely would recommend this buffet to anyone else. It was inexpensive, there wasn't a wait and it was conveniently located right off the strip!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Very roomy, and the crab legs were delicious! They had a great variety of food, and it was all top quality.  You get a ton for your money!  In addition, my boy Bill hooked us with a bucket of Budweiser's!  BIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!"}
{"text":"By far our favorite buffet on the strip. We come here every single trip and are never disappointed with the helpfulness of the servers, selection, and quality of the food. I am especially pleased with our last visit where the chef, Carlos, prepared me a special gluten-free pasta exactly to my specifications to accommodate my food allergies. He took special care not to cross-contaminate anything, switched gloves, and double checked the ingredients with me before making it. Such a nice treat for me! We will definitely continue our trend of getting breakfast/brunch and dinner here."}
{"text":"Delicious, affordable and we will return.  We were here recently and wanted to experience a famous buffet.  We got there right as breakfast was ending so we ate breakfast and at 11am the lunch food was served so we ate most of that.  Drinks such as wine and beer were included and it was great.  This place is a must and anyone in the area looking for a buffet needs to go."}
{"text":"Don't put this buffet on your stop next time you're in Vegas.   Cafeteria like atmosphere with bland, boring food to match.  Chewy Prime Rib and the Crab Legs were way too fishy tasting and dry.   The only bright spot were the baked good and desert station.   Also, this place looked VERY DIRTY.     Steer clear of this one.   Visit the Buffet at the Wynn or the buffet at the Paris (Le Village Buffet)."}
{"text":"This is my friends favorite buffet in Vegas, so definitely it was a must try for me.   We came here just right before Sunday brunch time and only had to pay for breakfast price, what a deal.   

I like the layout of this buffet, everything was labeled and easy to recognize, so I can choose what I want to eat while I'm sitting down.  Great variety and our waitress was really nice bringing back several refills whenever she saw our glass empty.  

Breakfast items that I enjoyed were French toast with bacon and sausage.
Lunch: Prime rib, cream corn and beef brisket.
Dessert: Oreo cheese cake

Plenty more stations to choose from, and their Chinese noodle station is awesome."}
{"text":"This was definitely one of my favorite buffets in Vegas...5 years ago.  I feel like the variety is slowly dwindling every single time I come back though.

I like how everything is easy to find and it's not an overwhelming amount of food.  I also like the selection that there still is there but I feel like everything quality wise is slowly going down as well.  I like the chinese food station cause they have one of my favorites, won ton noodle soup.  You just have to ask the sully looking dude standing behind the station to make it.

The gelato is also good too, however you need to flag down someone to serve it to you."}
{"text":"Plain buffet. I've had the same quality of food and taste at other buffets for cheaper.  Crab legs where pretty dry,  the pasta section doesn't even call your name..steak and mashed potatoes where good. I had guacamole with chips which where ok as well. The only good thing about the dessert section is the bread pudding and the yogurt machine.  I guess I was expecting more out of this place since it's in the mirage. I  will just stick to my cheaper buffets which offer the same thing anyways."}
{"text":"I wake up, head pounding, wondering where the hell I am. I glance to my left and see Liz passed out mouth open next to me. Aha Vegas. This means buffet.

Now, let me tell you, 9 girls getting ready is not a fun time when you ony have two rooms. I was hungover, in dire need of :
A)My morning coffee
B) A bottomless supply of mamosas
C) Mass amounts of food
D) All of the above.

So, after two hours of me pacing and complaining of the lack of speed from some hungover people we make our way to the Mirage. Buffet cost: $25. Shit. I told Kelly  would pay for her. This better be good for fifty bucks.

It was. There was everything! The waitress promptly brought us 9 mimosas and waters. Bottomless mimosas were included. I love it. I ate: A panini, deep dish pizza, gelato, sushi, chinese noodles, mashed potatoes, crab legs, shrimp, chilaquilas, breakfast burrito, and washed it down with 20 mimosas. Yes 20. The lady was awesome. I would take a sip after she finished pouring and she would come back and fill the little that I had drank. Then Liz didn't want hers and I aqcuired two glasses. This turned into a competition between Kelly and I, who could drink the most before she left the table. because this lady would always refill.

I love you lady. I asked you to come home with me but you wouldn't. But you ensured me to definitely come back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this buffet. Cravings offers several types of cuisine, but I never made it past the Chinese dishes and the raw bar. What made this buffet stand  out is the crab legs which are sliced in half making it easier to pull hunks of clean meat from the legs without all of the hastle. The big bowls of steamed mussels were wonderful as well."}
{"text":"Not a bad buffet but not a great one either. The food mostly seemed mediocre.

Roast beef carving station had no horseradish at all. The Chinese food was limited to beef broccoli and pepper steak. Their wonton soup was also fairly tasteless.

The buffet does offer free beer (Bud Light and Goose Island, at the time of the visit) and wine.

The soda machines are the new 100+ variety types.

The fish station had your garden variety of crab legs and one type of fish, which tasted like it'd been left out for a good while.

Which, in the end, left me with that meh feeling, in terms of satisfaction.

Small end note... For those in AAA, we were given a 20% AAA discount. Every little bit helps."}
{"text":"Ok, so through the myvegas app I had a buy one get one so it did only cost my husband and I $32 for the buffet, however neither of us were impressed. The food was only ok, and I ended up getting food poisoning and I know that it was 100% from there. Ruined my last night in Vegas since I ended up going back to my room and was up all night sick. Only good thing about it was that there was unlimited beer and wine included in the price."}
{"text":"I don't know how people are giving this place any stars!!. I can honestly say this place is not good it's  Monday at 4pm currently here while I am writing this review and I can say it's not good. People say it's good I don't know if there reviewing the wrong place but it can't be here. There is no variety, I mean there is but you will get maybe 2 plates. In the Latin section all you have is beans plantains and taquitos. How is that Latin food there is literally no food just sides!!! For God sacks this place doesn't even have rice. They ran out at 4pm! SMH. Take it from me spend your money else were. Everything taste like it was microwaved.... dessert ehhh DQ soft serve is better then anything here"}
{"text":"Gross run run run!!!! The worst I have ever tasted!  I didn't even drink the champagne with orange juice talk about cheap. The food tasted like cafeteria school food, the eggs were watered down the shrimp and sauce were nasty food was gross & then it said $16 in the front and when ww got in line it was $30 each??? Never ever coming back just DIRTY Nasty!"}
{"text":"Even though I've been to Las Vegas close to 10 times (annual trips), I've never been to Cravings Buffet so decided to give them a try during my April 2016 vacation since I heard that it was a buffet with all you can drink beer and house wine.

Out of the 4 buffets on the Strip that I experienced during my April 2016 vacation, this buffet was one of the larger buffets. Just for comparison purposes, on this trip, I went to Bacchanal which was the largest and second most expensive, Cravings which is slightly smaller (third expensive), followed by Monte Carlo Buffet (least expensive), and Sterling Brunch (smallest but most expensive).

I can only have 3 beers during a meal so in terms of all you can drink beer, I didn't really drink much. The beer was draft beer and I think I ordered Coors or a Bud Light (I can't remember which I ordered but it was a beer brand that you can get almost anywhere). For the beer and wine, you go to the corner at the right of the buffet and ask for a draft beer or house wine.

This place (just like Monte Carlo's buffet) is self serve for soft drinks. The soft drink machine was one of the higher end ones which allowed things like cherry Coke and allowed you to mix soft drinks with certain flavours.

In terms of food, I concentrated mainly on the seafood selection and the carving station. The seafood was good as was the carving station although I found the beef to be too red for my liking. The desserts were good as well.

The servers did a good job for me of taking my plates. Most of the time when I went to get a new plate and returned to my chair, my old plate was removed.

I don't remember the price that I paid to have a late lunch at Cravings Buffet but there was a voucher at the Tix4Tonight booth that you can purchase for Cravings.

I found the buffet to be good and slightly better and more selection than Monte Carlo's buffet (and also slightly more expensive). Since I'm not a heavy beer drinker, for me, it was merely a chance to have a few beers without having to think about any extra costs.

I wouldn't have any issues returning to Cravings in my next Las Vegas trip. However with all the other buffets on the Strip that I haven't tried, nothing really stood out enough for me to say \"I HAVE to return here\".

I would probably rank them 3.5 stars which rounds up on Yelp to 4 stars since half stars aren't allowed and I don't want to shortchange them."}
{"text":"This buffet has gone down hill since last year. Now you have to get your own drinks, not my idea of an upscale buffet. And the area that the drinks are in now was more food stations before. So there is now less of a selection and food was not very good. But they have added a free beer and wine for all the big drinkers out there."}
{"text":"Our friend convinced us to check out Cravings buffet before the Love show and boy were we sorely wrong about this place. We came at 5pm and the food selection was temperature cold and we are not talking about the raw bar but the cooked heated food sections.  The only thing at the raw bar are crab legs.

The prime rib was not flavorful---lacked a distinct beef taste even with the Au Jus--remember to include the au jus...you'll need it since it is soooo dry and bland. The roast turkey was also bland and uneventful...thankfully they have turkey gravy a few feet away. 

The Chinese and Japanese sections were terrible....the singapore rice noodles were overly seasoned with soy sauce which destroyed the curry flavor. the fried rice and steamed rice were colder than ice cream. the fried rice was overly seasoned with soy sauce.  the roast pork and duck were lifeless and bland...i've had better in Hong Kong....so don't expect much in this section.

the italian and latin foods were also bland, salty and cold. 

TIP: if you want hot food, eat whatever you pick right then and there since by the time you get to your table, the food will be cooooooooooooold. 

the only lifesaver was the service from our waiter...he was great and made the experience better....

the food is TERRRRRRRRRIBLE --- COLD, BLAND, SALTY and VARIETY CHALLENGED....SAVE your $ and avoid even the early bird special and go to the Wynn."}
{"text":"Two words: UNLIMITED BOOZE!

However, the food here is whatever considering for a similar price I can go to bachannal or wicked spoon. The food here is pretty in the middle for me. My favorite thing are the king crab legs, prime rib and salmon. However, a lot of the food here were stale or utter failures. I am surprised I didn't break my teeth on the garlic bread here or macarons. Pretty much, some stuff were super cold and old and they just leave it there... they need to do a better job of switching stuff out.

However, they have goose island ipa, a solid cab, chard and a solid dessert zinfadel. I hate to admit but the drinks here outrank the food. Compared to the above listed buffets, the desserts here were just miserable. Nothing tasted amazing. If not for my buy one get one free, I would never try this buffet.

Just save yourselves the money and go to bachannal."}
{"text":"This buffet was amazing. I've eaten at mandalay, aria, etc.. and this is well up there. The thing I loved is that on the price of the buffet u get free unlimited beer or wine ( dinner buffet only) All other locations charge $10+ to add alcoholic drinks. Very good selection.  I would absolutely goo back.  I suggest u try it. U won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I would definitely come here again. They have gluten free options and free wine! What more can u ask for? I also appreciated the Sui Chef's efforts; he explained all of the gf options and even printed out additional info for me."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast as we are staying at the mirage and $20 per person seemed like a good deal for a breakfast buffet.

Unfortunately a lot more limited in choices than I thought there would be for breakfast. 

I was here for lunch last time I was in Vegas and every area had food at it, breakfast only showcases some breakfast foods at some of the stations: Latin, omelet bar, etc.

The food lacked too much flavor unfortunately and I can now say that the cheaper price for breakfast definitely correlated to the lack of options and impressiveness.

I still did love the lunch and maybe it was an off day, so try it if you wish!"}
{"text":"The prime rib was really good as were many of the other meats.  The desserts were so-so.  Not too long of a wait."}
{"text":"Disgusting with a capital D!  The prime rib was as tough as shoe leather, the mashed potatoes came from a box.  30 minutes before closing they had already removed all of the place cards at the stations so you had no idea what you were scooping onto your plate. Paid $30.00 for the privilege of eating here only to spend the entire night sitting on the loo with a garbage can at the ready because my tummy was revolting from both ends. I could eat Hubby's cooking and be sick at home for free. Never again!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were able to get this buffet free of charge after redeeming our myVEGAS rewards.  The food was fine, but nothing outstanding.  We were all glad we didn't pay $30 for it.

There are a lot of selections including: Italian, Latin, Chinese, sushi, crab legs, American, barbecue, salad bar, etc.  You will easily find something that you like.  I'm a sushi fanatic so I got some.  Nothing to write home about, but it hit the spot.  Dessert was the highlight.  Lots of bite size things to choose from.

The staff were all really nice, especially Lucy who was very patient when her printer wasn't working and moved to another station to help us out."}
{"text":"Get there at 10:45, rush to the breakfast section and then take your time and eat.

When they place out all the lunch options, get em all. 

This place is soo amazingly fantastic. I really like it a lot and we went there twice."}
{"text":"This buffet is average. A few of the positives were the pizza and the beverages. Unlike many buffets where there is typically a dried out pie that looks like it has been under the heat lamp for hours, the pizza here is made fresh in view of the customers. The beverages included Coca-Cola freestyle and unlimited beer (Bud Light & Dos Equis) along with a sampling of wine. The other foods were decent, however some items did not appear very appetizing. The carving area is the first I have seen without a grill. When I ordered prime rib cooked medium well, the attendant seemed put off that he had to walk my meat over to where the grill was located. The dessert section was also limited. Very obscure items and nothing looked very appealing. The server was friendly but not very attentive. Overall, a good value for the money, but I will not be rushing to return."}
{"text":"Yum! This was a great buffet! I used a MyVegas reward for buy one get one free for dinner on a Saturday night. That process was painless and we really enjoyed our experience. When we walked in we were impressed with the layout and variety of food. Even the standard buffet items like pizza and salad were really good! Nothing standard about them! We also did not realize there would be crab legs! So good!!! Two different kinds, both split for you making them easy to eat. We went right before closing but they continued to restock everything very quickly! We also really enjoyed the sushi and of course dessert! Not to mention unlimited wine and beer for free! The white zin was awesome and virtually no line at the bar. Plus you can get a drink in a to go cup before you leave! The best buffet I've ever been to!"}
{"text":"Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Or, maybe my standards have just gotten higher.

Cravings was one of the first buffets I visited when I started coming to Vegas in the mid-2000s. At the time, I remember it as being a top-notch buffet, so I was excited to return on this trip.

All I can say is one word: blah. The food was standard and boring, and mostly tasteless. Service was abominable and it took me nearly ten minutes to be asked what I wanted to drink. I can only think of one dish that was memorable in a good way, and it was a dessert bar. 

It's been nice knowing ya, Cravings. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I paid $80 dollars for me and my lady to enjoy one last buffet on the strip. Over all the food was great, presentation was on par. 

The only problem, which is a deal breaker for who ever you are, is that we were sat next to these loud cholas and cholo who were cussing and yelling, that could be heard from across the buffet... Which is reasonably large. Their topic of discussion was wanting to have MORE children with their significant others while they were dealing with cheating spouses and other terribly inappropriate topics. 

Our waiter, Alex, had asked them to keep it down once, but then they started speaking Spanish with Alex and they started joking around. Soon enough, the waiter ignored their rowdiness and my lady and I ended up listening to grotesque details of the unfortunate souls we were sitting next to. 

All in all, the food and price for a place can be the best in town. If the staff has the lack of respect for the consideration of the customer as a whole, then the business shouldn't be rated anything better than a brothel where STD's run a muck. Because quite honestly, that's how I felt after enduring these people's loud, annoying conversation."}
{"text":"I don't know from Vegas buffet's but for me, staying at the Mirage, this was a decent experience for breakfast both times I went."}
{"text":"Not sure why the quality has gone down. Crab legs were the skinniest I've ever seen and the temperature of the food was warm at best. The Asian section is being renovated but that should not impact their standards. If it does they should inform customers or reduce the price. I have always enjoyed it before and looked forward to eating here. 
I won't be back. There are many other choices!"}
{"text":"This buffet keeps getting better and better. Almost as good as back in its glory days of the 80's and 90's. 
Cindy is amazing and a huge asset. 
Food was great, service great and decent price. No matter where we stay in the future, we will always stop for lunch or dinner here."}
{"text":"I've only been here for the breakfast buffet, and I really enjoyed everything they offered. But, it's really hard to go wrong with breakfast food.

This is where I tried my first eggs benedict and was HOOKED from that point on. Omelettes, eggs, french toast, waffles, sausages, bacon, and more that were good quality and might tasty.

Staff was very attentive at refilling drinks, and although it was not super cheap for a weekend breakfast buffet, it was totally worth it! I would definitley go back and fill up at their breakfast buffet."}
{"text":"The Cravings Buffet at The Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas offers eleven international food stations serving dishes on an all-you-can-eat basis with unlimited wine and beer. It's  the only buffet with an enhanced self service beverage station with 150 plus coca cola flavors, all for $31 per person for dinner.

The set up of each International food station is very identifiable and they are laid out in an orderly fashion.

I particularly enjoyed the crab legs at the seafood station, since the legs were already cut in half and very easy to eat. I enjoyed it together with the mixed fried rice.

The selection of Sushi and Sashimi are good but I was not particularly blown away (I had tried a better Japanese buffet off the strip.)

All in all, with its rich selection of dishes, best value and great customer service, Cravings at The Mirage is highly recommended. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Lots of varieties. But the food tasted very average for a widespread buffet. The Italian section had omelettes being served. Desserts were not bad, liked their double chocolate mousse."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on December 21st for dinner after it was recommended to us by the Tix4tonight because it was close to our show's location.  We thought... meh why not? 

The ambiance of the place was pretty good and the waitstaff there were very hospitable - the only aspects that prevents it from getting one star. Other than that, I would definitely not go back.

The food, first of all, was HORRIBLE.  For the price of almost $30, I've never been to a buffet more terrible than this one.  Basically, it's an International Buffet with foods: Chinese, Japanese, Latin, Italian, BBQ/roasted meats, seafoods... and of course all-you-can-drink beer, wine and non-alcoholic stuff.  The crab legs were tasteless, sushi rolls were unimpressive (rice was too hard), their Chinese food consisted mostly of North Americanized creations.  At the Italian stations, their food was lukewarm.   I've walked around the buffet many many circles to find things I'd like to eat but unfortunately didn't have too many things on my plate.  Besides the dessert station which was okay, their food selection, variety and quality was inadequate.  When tasting the food, it just doesn't taste fresh and we were both really really disappointed."}
{"text":"I would have to say the food here was pretty good and the selection was more than worth the money.  They have fresh omelletes made there, and breakfast pizzas, tons of meat, sausages, bacon, fruit, yogurt, bagels, cheese, etc.  The only thing that stopped me from giving it was 5 star was the staff.  We went there on a Monday morning.  Our first server forgot the milk that my wife ordered and I had to hunt her down after seeing here walk pass us a few times without the milk in sight.  Then after half an hour, another server took over and I finished my first glass of orange juice so I asked him for another glass.  He went into the kitchen for about 5 minutes and then came out a bunch of juice containers and walked off into the other side of the restaurant.  I gave up on the OJ and we left.  Also another thing was the women at the cheese/deli meat station.  The salmon plate was almost finished so an older European gentlemen politely asked her to change it saying \" the salmon looks sad, can you change it please?\" and she walked away to another side that I was close to and while she was unpacking a new salmon plate, I could hear her mumble, \"the only thing sad here is you\".  I would expect better service at such a nice hotel but obviously they've gotta better train their buffet staff.  I would come back for the hotel (our 3 night stay in our room was fantastic), and I would eat the food, but I don't think I'd come back if I saw the same servers and kitchen staff working there."}
{"text":"We came here because we were watching LOVE and only had an hour to grab dinner. 29/pp wasn't bad for the food. I had them heat my king crab legs and those came out delicious. The prawns were big and the bay shrimp in different sauces were good. The prime rib could have been better, but it is a buffet.  Our server was attentive, constantly clearing plates and refilling our drinks."}
{"text":"We came here for the breakfast buffet and we thought it was great. There was such a large variety to choose from that I can't name everything I had seen. If you're vegan, keto, low-carb, vegetarian, carnivore, herbivore or a sugarholic there is something there for you. I would definitely come back here for breakfast."}
{"text":"I've been to this buffet a few times for breakfast now. It offers pretty much any type cuisine you could possibly be \"craving\"... even in the early morning hours. The food is always fresh and served at the proper temperature.  

My husband always makes sure to have an omelet made to order. He really enjoys them, though I never want to waste those few minutes waiting for an egg to be prepared when I could spend that time loading my plate with all those other goodies. The one item I never miss is the warm chocolate bread pudding topped with hot fudge sauce. You can almost taste it now, can't you? ;)"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite buffet. The ambiance is very very bland, but the food is really good and is one of the cheaper buffets- $34.99 per person. Their crab was so fresh.   I kept loading up on the crab, shrimp, tortellini Alfredo, and mini donuts. Those were all my favorites and I def ate like $75 worth of food for only $35. The other buffets have a lot of the same food but charge double just because the ambiance Is cool. Buffets to me are all about the food, might as well pay half when you aren't even looking around and are only focusing on the food"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of buffets, but as a participant in the Rock'n'Roll half marathon (2014), I took advantage of the buy one get one free offer, and spared my friend $25.99 ( Brunch price per person).  I have to admit, food was fresh, hot and above average for a buffet. Also, the service was on point; quick, efficient cashiers, and fast, friendly servers. 

- All-you-can eat ( international cuisine ): Chinese, Mexican, waffles, fruits & salads, omelets, sushi, pizza, and big selection of desserts. 
- Bottomless champagne or mimosa (weekend brunch).
- Fresh coffee and juice.
- Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Solid three Yelps."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas with my wife and she said that we just had to go to this buffet because it was the best. She had been there about five years earlier when our brother-in-law was working at the Mirage, and she loved it. Maybe we caught them on an off-day or it was between lunch and dinner, but I was not at all impressed by this buffet. Not that it was bad, but there just wasn't much to write home about. They had some very basic \"sushi\" rolls, none of which used raw fish. The italian food was laughable, but that's generally how it is out west. The chinese food was pretty good, but that was not enough to save them. And for the price, they needed to have a lot more going on here. It cost almost as much as the buffet at the Bellagio, which was absolutely the most elegant buffet I have ever seen. In my opinion, skip this one and go to the Bellagio."}
{"text":"Review is strictly on table service: we have been coming to this buffet for NYE for 3 years now and this was the worst service of all time. We did not receive silverware after being seated for 10 minutes so I had to go find a waiter and when I told him, he gave me a \"I don't serve your table look\" and barely brought them to us. Then our plates stayed piled up for quite some time, almost our entire dinner."}
{"text":"Atmosphere (cafeteria), marginal food, and high price ($35 each) made this our biggest disappointment of our trip. Buffet restaurant Sweet Tomatoes was our biggest delight.

Food was dry. Coffee not great. Desserts sad. Atmosphere was absent. We struggled with crab legs for about 20 minutes and were finished, when our low energy table host brought us a single shell cracking tool.

Cravings was simply a waste of good money and is strongly discouraged. Hit your local crappy buffet wherever you're from at half the price, and you've had the same experience."}
{"text":"This was the worst dining experience we had during our stay.  I could get better food from our local hometown buffet for a fraction of the cost.  Everything tasted boxed or canned, stale, etc.  only positive was I did not over eat because the food was sooooo bad!  Will never go back."}
{"text":"We love this buffet - it always has interesting, healthy food prepared by folks who obviously know what they are doing. We tried to share each plate in order to taste everything. Highlights were the cioppino (perfect broth), kimchi, seaweed salad, carved corned beef and pork belly, goat cheese pizza, asian soups, tzatziki, breakfast burritos with ranchero sauce, ceviche (with extra chilled shrimp), fried plantain, coconut macaroons, breakfast berries, and little parfait cups of chocolate moca mousse with tiny spoons! The service was friendly and the bartender didn't blink when we asked for chardonnay for our breakfast juice along with a glass of Guinness IPA, woohoo!"}
{"text":"Average buffet in Vegas but I thought good for the price. The breakfast for $17.99 is a good deal considering all the things available."}
{"text":"review is for sunday brunch only 

WOW! the sunday brunch @ cravings inside the mirage was great. i'm not a buffet person (i usually go once if i'm in vegas..or sometimes not at all. i enjoy going to restaurants instead of buffets, but when my friends want to go i'll join) and it was sunday brunch. i was tired (only slept for 4 hours since friday) hung over and not in the mood, but it was our last meal so i just sucked it up and went...i'm so glad i did. 

it's approx $26 for the buffet and champagne. when i went in i got the congee (rice porridge) and it helped me feel better instantly. i also went to the dim sum section and got some dim sum and a bowl of won ton noodle soup (which also helped my hangover). after feeling better i enjoyed all the sections around the buffet: asian, seafood, mexican, italian, etc. 

i would recommend this buffet for breakfast/brunch and i would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Absolute WORST place in Vegas- such a disappointment. #1 the staff has no idea what is going on, whatsoever. We were overcharged for our meal TWICE. The staff was rude. They don't let you eat anywhere near the buffet. I have had SUCH amazing experiences everywhere else in Las Vegas EXCEPT for this place. Pretty big disappointment."}
{"text":"One of the best buffets I've been to. Beer, wine and mimosas were included with the buffet. Price is reasonable and most of the food was AMAZING. Plus they have those awesome soda machines that add the flavor syrups to any soda that you like. 

Only downside was that the waiter cleared our table and we weren't done yet. He did offer to go get us new drinks even though that isn't part of his job (drinks are self-service here).

Definitely will be going back here."}
{"text":"Better than the others in Vegas, but still it's a buffet.

Went for a late brunch which turned into lunch. The desserts were amazing. The cinnamon buns cannot be missed. You must try them! Lots of the brunch options were good... It's less than $20, too, before lunchtime (11?)"}
{"text":"Food comes out of bags...sushi station looks like it's a street corner cart...no drink service you get everything yourself....super sad..."}
{"text":"I have had better food and service at Ryan's. We paid $32 per person and a 18% gratuity because we sat with relatives at the same table so a total of $38 per person. 

The meat (prime rib, salmon, sausage) was all over cooked. The pasta was cold. The dessert bar was lack luster. The menu posted outside specifically stated \"hot lava cake\" (the reason my in-laws wanted to eat there) but it was not actually being served.

The server cleared that table only twice despite the 18% gratuity."}
{"text":"Great buffet. Decent salad bar, lots of drinks and free beer and wine. Deserts were good but they needed to put out more, they were depleted fast. Only main complaint was that crab legs were tiny and shriveled up. Get better crab legs!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This buffet was just okay. You get pretty spoiled on the strip. The desserts were lame but the quality was otherwise pretty good.  Not as mant choices as I'm used to seeing but very clean and courteous service."}
{"text":"Every time I stay at the Mirage I always end up at Cravings Buffet. They're affordably priced, discounted at Tix4Tonight or free if you play MyVegas. How can you say no to a cheap/free buffet? You don't. 

It's not the newest Buffet on the Strip and it's starting to show. Most menu items don't state if they're gluten free or vegan, they don't offer individual plated items like the trendy Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal Buffet, and they'll laugh if you ask for fresh pressed juice. Most of the food here is just average, with me continuing in search to find a menu item to write home about.

With that said, they do have some amazing perks to lure Yelpers who see their 3 star review to stop by. First of all they offer unlimited wine and select beer. Yes, unlimited. It's not an additional $14 per person which is the average around the Strip, it's included in your Buffet price! Compared to the $14-$27 drinks by the pool, it's worth it to stop by Cravings beforehand for a few drinks while enjoying your DIY fruit and cheese plate. 

Is it the best buffet in Vegas? No. But compared to prices for alcohol and light snacks in the area, dropping $11 (discounted from Tix4Tonight across the street) for an AYCE buffet, its still a steal. Go in with low expectations and you'll find a few reasons to leave happy. Best of all they do offer a variety of gluten free items and are willing to make anything gluten free if you ask - even pancakes, pizza and fried chicken sliders! Just ask!"}
{"text":"3 stars for a buffet is pretty good since there are a variety of foods there!  Everything was just okay.  There were some things that stood out a lot such as the lobster ravioli, the dim sum stuff, and the tilapia fish.  Other things such as the sushi, which was cold, some noodles were hard, but overall, everything was pretty good. Love the dessert station!  There is a section for sugar free desserts too so you don't feel so bad for eating it.  There were lots of desserts and my favorite was the tiramisu and some kind of dark chocolate ganache thing. super yummy!  I would probably not come back here but we had some free vouchers so why not!

NOTE:
-bathrooms located outside of the buffet"}
{"text":"I visited cravings years ago and was not impressed. However, being the fatty I have become, I came back twice, yes, twice during my recent stay. The first time we were waiting for our room to be ready early in the morning. We walked around the different options but found that regular breakfasts would cost the same amount, or more, as the buffet (14.99 I believe). The choice was pretty obvious.

BREAKFAST:

yummy pastries- the muffins, cookies, and donuts were delicious. The croissants not so much. 
bagels with lots of different toppings
omelette station ( I didn't try but looked good)
fresh fruits
cereal
deli meats and cheeses
good hash browns

One complaint is that the waitress kept forgetting my water. I asked for it maybe 4 times. She kept bringing me coffee and juice, so it's not that she was not attentive. Not a big deal!

THe next time we went for lunch because as we were having breakfast we saw some of the stuff they were going to have for lunch and it sounded great (gelato!!). 

LUNCH

highlights:
Prime rib!! (SO GOOD!)
ceviche (scallops and shrimp)
pot stickers
seafood
salad (you choose the toppings and they make it/toss it for you)
Gelato! lots of options and toppings!!!! The presentation and the way that it is made is also fun.
the bar!! - mimosas/champagne were not included since it was a friday. But I really wanted one! the bartender checked and it was 11.99. I thought it was a bit much for a mimosa, specially considering how the sparkling wine was $9! The bartender, however, was able to ring it up as $9 for me. He also changed the channels for us and was great about cleaning up our dirty plates and refilling our soft drinks. A+ for him!"}
{"text":"With so many options for buffets, Cravings has a hard time standing out. Wicked Spoon, Bacchanal and other upper tier buffets are much better, while other hotel buffets are about on par with the Mirage.

Price wise it's similar to any other Vegas buffet on the strip not mentioned above. Selection is decent and pretty standard. Different cuisines all organized around the eating area. The AYCE beer and wine stand out, but food is just a-okay.

We redeemed our myVEGAS reward here and the total came out to about $15 a person for dinner which was great. 

I also saw that they offer a to-go box for around $16 and just get as much as you can from the buffet, which doesn't sound like a bad deal."}
{"text":"*sigh* So... Much... Zinfandel... All you can eat, and all you can drink. Good enough for me for the price. It's a lot cheaper to just carry out if you want a quick meal, but for a delicious buffet located conveniently on the floor level of your hotel it's priced fairly anyway. The food selections were awesome, and they had a wide variety of desserts. The gelato was bomb. I haven't yelped in a while so I forgot to take pictures.  People aren't lying about the ambience being bland though."}
{"text":"Crab legs, seafood cioppino and much much more. 

You cannot go wrong with their prime rib. It was super tender and juicy.

Most of the items were great but there are a few that were down right nasty, like the lemon butter mussels. The mussels looked and smelled like they were rotting just prior to cooking. 

I brought my friends here and they all said they liked it. This is a must on my Vegas trips."}
{"text":"My fiance and I came here for brunch and it was absolutely delicious. We scored a buy one get one free deal off of the free game on Facebook, MyVegas. If you're a frequent visitor (even if you aren't, rack up those loyalty points!) the benefits of playing will definitely pay out! For two people we paid approximately $25 or so, included house wine and beers. My fiance is not a huge fan or breakfast or brunch, yet still noted that this was a great buffet and everything tasted great. He even told me that we should return for dinner! The prime rib was perfect, the country fried steak was meh (dry). Staff was attentive and great, the line wasn't too shabby. If you don't really want to spend too much money but want that Vegas buffet experience- come over to Cravings!"}
{"text":"Well worth it. Free beer and wine at dinner. Awesomeness. Would comee here again and recommend it. Variety of food"}
{"text":"Absolute rip off and garbage! What a joke no better than your local buffets at home.  We went for breakfast on a Saturday morning and got f'd over.  We were charged dinner prices and not offered the champagne brunch. The breakfast food was cold and like eating at a military base. Cafeteria pancakes and french toast. They had started to turn over to lunch and we sampled other foods to find something decent. Pizza undercooked and similar to what my kids would get at school. Chinese..only 2 dishes both ehh. Many different types of food italian,chinese, sushi,etc but none...none of them done well. We were dumb enough to just walk up and pay. If you don't believe this is crap try it for yourself..just by discounted tickets so you don't get taken as bad as we did..$60 plus for 2"}
{"text":"I had my first champagne brunch here and I loved it!!! Even though it was an international brunch type thing, I think the asian section was the best. I felt bad for having a salad at a buffet, but I don't regret it. Their salad was so fresh, you choose all your ingredients, I had to have it. The dessert selection was kind of a bummer, but the ice cream was good. This, for me, was way, way better than the Rio Carnival \"World\" buffet."}
{"text":"I can not believe how bad the food is here. Most every item was Cold dried out and tasteless. I don't understand all the 4 star ratings. Cafeteria food and I mean high school cafeterias are better then this. To be fair the prime rib and chefs station that cooks pasta to order was good/ok. A very disappointing dinner."}
{"text":"Although it was the cheapest buffet on the strip with crab legs (which influenced me) I was very disappointed...selection was very limited and prime rib was well done, deserts and salad bar also disappointing...I will not go back."}
{"text":"Been here before and loved this buffet, so I decided to eat here again since I was staying in the hotel. Food was delicious with a lot of selection to pick from. They have unlimited wine and beer! I went for dinner so it was $35. It was worth every dollar. I will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd do two buffets in one night.  To be honest, I wasn't even that hungry.  I know it's sacrilege to walk into a buffet when you're not that hungry, but we couldn't decide where else to eat.

So why four stars??  Because I didn't feel overwhelmed or disgusted.  I wasn't too hungry, but I managed to eat well and not feel disgusted.  They had a good raw bar with fresh shrimp and crab legs.  The ceviche was damn spicy!!  

Probably my fav was the Japanese noodle soup which they prepare on the spot so it's nice and warm, and the noodles don't get soggy!!  The broth was so excellent on a chilly winter night!!"}
{"text":"Don't do it.  If someone forces you to do it, prepare yourself: Think back to your college cafeteria experience, then lower the bar...by a lot."}
{"text":"Disappointed.

Ended up going here for dinner because other top buffets either closed their buffet lines early due to overcrowding or had waits of 2 hours+.  Waited one hour to get in.

Not sure why Cravings still appears on many top 10 buffet lists.  The servers were slow, there were limited food options, and the warming stations were not very well attended to.  Lots of items were mislabeled."}
{"text":"We came for Sunday brunch after checking out of Mirage at 1 pm. There was no wait and the cost (~$35/person) was pretty inexpensive compared to other casino buffets. That said, you get what you pay for. The shrimp seemed like it had been sitting out since brunch started at 8 am. The fruit selection was very small (melon, pineapple - no berries). My favorite items were the omelet station, crab legs and soups. Our server was wonderful and efficient refilling our champagne and mimosas. Overall, I'd go back if staying at the Mirage and looking for a good value. If you are looking for an impressive Vegas buffet experience, go elsewhere and spend a bit more."}
{"text":"Well in the land of Buffet's this isn't the very best or the cheapest but they are in the top with me.  They get a lot of points with because they serve Pho (ok its not the best but it has fresh broth and noodles) and the overall quality of the food is very good plus the shear variety pleases me to no end :)

Positives
The kitchens of each of the food types are open to view.
Decor is lovely, modern and has a variety of decorations.
Tons of variety: Sandwich bar, Asian Noodle & Dim Sum, Japanese, Italian, Chinese, American, Mexican, BBQ, desert, Omelet Station, peel and eat shrimp, and so on.

Negatives
Its a buffet - as much as I love them they can be very impersonal.

I have been here a couple times and I do enjoy it but like any Buffet they do have some inconsistencies with food quality - some items amazing and some, well, sucky.  They are a safe bet though and I will go again!"}
{"text":"We ate here twice in two days. The first day was better than the second. The food just seemed better on the first day.

Anyway, many things to eat as with all LV buffets. I really liked the biscuits and breakfast items,  seafood soup, the salad and fruit stations. Just so much of everything. I teeter between 3-4 stars as a rating.

One drawback. I wish they had a separate option for opting out of the unlimited champagne / mimosa pricing. I don't really care to drink during brunch. Seeing as we went both times over a holiday weekend, we had to pay the higher prices. Oh well, it's Vegas!

Cheers to all"}
{"text":"Really good stuff! Crab legs, prime rib, shrimp cocktail, just to name a few items. They had most anything you would want, from Asian food, to american food, and got our tickets at the tix4tonight booth so paid only $20 for lunch.Definitely good place to check out!"}
{"text":"just some random thoughts on my experience during sunday brunch:
crab legs and shrimp cocktails were ice cold as in nearly frozen and biting ice chunks
typical buffet bacon that tastes like it was microwaved 
carving station lacked premium meats, just your typical roast beef and ham
wife said her omelet was very good
wife said pastries were hard and stale tasting
creme brule was disappointing.. the custard part was all thick and hard
they had a wood fired pizza oven that got me excited but the pizza didnt taste much different than your typical buffet pizza
was seated with a good view of the game on during NFL Sunday but only a small % of people there would be able to really see the only TV they had 
gelato was a nice touch and my favorite thing there, loved mixing the butterscotch and vanilla together and tasted just as good as some gelato stands ive been to."}
{"text":"I have been to many Vegas buffets over the years, and I think this is my favorite! There was a lot of variety, and almost everything I tried was yummy and good quality. I was bummed to miss the bottomless champagne option, but glasses of wine were only $5-$7, which is super cheap by Vegas standards. I wasn't expecting much as the only reason we ended up here was because we were seeing Love later that night, but I was very pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Just another strip buffet. Most of the buffets on the strip or surrounding areas are about the same, this one had a large selection of items, was very clean and kept everything filled and warm. The quality of the food was good, not buffet is the best, but has decent food. The atmosphere was great and so was the customer service."}
{"text":"It was better than the buffett at Caesars. You have two choices of crab legs, cold or warm. Big difference in flavor. They have a chefs station to get pasta cooked while you watch. An Italian section with delicious selections. A carving station with rib eye, sausage and turkey. Turkey was a little dry. A seafood session with shrimp, crabs, and ciopinno. A Latin section with southern  American flavors. And American station with bbq and Mac and cheese. An Asian section with sushi and soups and seaweed salad. Have a salad made or create your own charcuterie plate. Plus they have a great desert section on the side with so much sweets that I got a cavity just by looking around. My tooth throbbed. I ate some anyway. And had some sorbet. Stuffed when I waddled out. Almost asked for a wheelchair."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, I'm not a big buffet person. The cost of dinner was almost $30, I could of had a nice sit down dinner for that somewhere else. But, much to my joy I happened to hit Pearl on my Mlife card on my last trip so I decided I'd take advantage of the line pass and hit up Cravings at Mirage.

Honestly, it wasn't great. If you just want to stuff your face on prime rib and crab legs then, it's fine. The prime rib was the best thing here. But everything else was super mediocre. They have a tiny salad bar, where a guy makes you a salad... I didn't even bother waiting for that. Of all the hot dishes, most were dried out, or picked out. (like there would be ribs, but the mashed potatoes were empty) None of the bread baskets had butter. It also seemed like an odd mix of food...

I went on a Saturday night, it was pretty busy, I was surprised there wasn't more of a good selection. There wasn't really anyone even tending to the food which I found strange.

Overall, I'd skip it, the food was ok, it's jut not great for the value.."}
{"text":"After reading a bunch of good review about this buffet, as a buffet fan, I decided to give it a try when I come to Vegas on my 21 bday. This craving is good with lots of food culture areas. However, honestly, I am kinda disapointed about the food tasting here. It quite so so but the cocktail is sooo good. Not bad for a try."}
{"text":"Went there during Xmas time and the food was just an okay.... only thing that is really stands out are the prime ribs but other dishes seems to be made by chef-Mike (microwave) and the shirmp cocktails still with full of ice on the shirmp...yikes. the service was slow for our drinks.... overall just an okay experience"}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews but this buffet is terrible. We were offered a coupon that made the buffet 30% off. The selections were cold and limited. I believe the coupon is to stir people into a failing restaurant. If you want an amazing buffet experience go to Bacchanal at Ceasar's!"}
{"text":"One thing I love about Vegas is trying out all the different Buffets. Do not get me wrong I am very meticulous about the ones I go to. We were getting hungry and so were our friends. We all decided to come here for dinner. Make sure you have your \"M life\" card, as it does help points wise.

For dinner its $26.99 per person, yes I know it is a little steep but its Vegas plus you are getting a lot of food. When we arrived, the line was pretty long at 8:00pm on a Tuesday night but the lone cashier kept the line moving. While standing in line we were laughing at the LCD TV's they have up. At random times they will have different foods flashing up but in slow motion (kind of like food sex) not going to explain anymore, you will just have to go yourself to see it!

The host who sat us was not too friendly but we were seated pretty fast, our table was close to the action so we didn't have to walk to far to get to everything. Only thing I totally hated was the bathrooms which were not located inside the buffet, you had to walk out hang a left, and there they were! 

Our waiter was nice but it seemed like her mind was somewhere else. She took our drink orders and said we could start eating whenever we would like. All four of us made a mad dash in different directions!  FOOOODDDDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This buffet has:

-Pho (it is freshly made at some point, but sits out)
-Wontons
-Crab legs (I was impressed that these legs had a lot of meat)
-Jumbo Shrimp
-Prime Rib
-Turkey
-Lemon herb chicken
-Various pre-made sushi and sashimi's (eeps do not touch)
-Various deli meats and slices of cheese
-Pasta
-Veggies
-Potatoes (Both mashed and wedges)
-Woodfire Pizza
-Mexican slow-roasted pork
-Greek Salad
-Chips and salsa
-Cornbread


Dessert:

-Mango or Pistachio pudding
-Chocolate Mousse
-Various cheesecakes (sugar free option too)
-Chocolate logs
-Large selection of sugar free stuff
-Macaroons (no I did not miss-spell it, it is not the French kind)
-Fruit
-Whipped topping
-Ice Cream
-Mini Pies
-Cookies


And oh so much more!


After about four plates, I was tapping out... I had to sit for about 20mins before I could start on the dessert end. 

The food was not bad unlike some of the reviews I have read. I put it this way some days are better than others, it happens everywhere you go! You just have to look and know before you decide on what you are going to grab and eat. 

Our waiter took our plates away pretty fast and our drinks were filled with a smile. 

We left in food comas and wanting our beds!! Good job cravings for stuffing us silly!!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying a buffet in Vegas; last trip here was in 2006. I had only dined at the buffet at Rio back then. The food was good, although nothing exceptional. They feature dishes from many nationalities, plus barbecue, grilled meat, prime rib, and seafood. Plusses were the shrimp, prime rib, and stir fry. Also the squash soup, shrimp ceviche, and guacamole were delicious. Minuses were pasta dishes and Chinese noodle dishes; they had sat out so long they looked dried out. Desserts were great though; try the tiramisu in the chocolate cup.  Atmosphere was a cross between cafeteria and cafe. A bit pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"They have different sections of food, mexican, american, italian, chinese but not a big selection of each. And the food isnt the best. We went there bc of the unlimited beer, but it was only bud light and some other beer. It was too pricy for the selection if u ask me. $37 for dinner."}
{"text":"This was the first dinner buffet we hit, upon arriving in Las Vegas. 

This place honors the Military by offering 20% off the bill. That, alone was the reason they will get 5 stars. No other place we went to in the 4 days we were gave any type of discount. 

The crab legs are split in half and were easier to eat. Our Grandsons love crab and shrimp and were in heaven. The Chef makes pasta and you can offer him a tip. Again, I say that Buffets that already charge $30 per person should not expect us to tip their cooks for  cooking something that should be included in the buffet already. 

Their prime rib was delicious. I skipped the salad bar and filled up on potatoes and prime rib. It was as good as any place I've been. 

My husband went for the Asian food and wasn't thrilled at all. 

Dessert was fun. A little of everything. I would complain only of the dirty carpet and cramped tables. There was  not enough room to move around. All in all, for the amount of $$ we spent here, it was acceptable. Thank you for honoring your Military."}
{"text":"I thought Rio's was the best until I came to Cravings. Obviously there's all kinds of food from around the world, but what really makes it special is the unlimited beer"}
{"text":"Great price for everything you get and no long lines. 34.99 buffet with unlimited beer and wine"}
{"text":"One of the very few buffets in Las Vegas worth spending money on.  I appreciate the fact that the food planners at Cravings don't see their customers as oversized trucks waiting to plow into everything and anything for as cheap as possible.  

The dinner selection was quite extensive but since it is divided into sections, it's more than manageable.  The crab legs are fresh and quite delicious and the Asian section was just as good.  I got a bit of everything including the turkey, pizza and pasta.  The dessert selection is also original and the gelato was spot on.  There are several cooking stations serving up ready-to-make food, so freshness is not so much an issue. 

The service was excellent and I've usually been seated away from the main area, so it did not feel overwhelming like a high school cafeteria.    If you have to eat at a buffet and are not a huge fan of it like I am, Cravings is your best bet."}
{"text":"As a patron of the Mirage Hotel, our vacation group frequented the Cravings Buffet nearly every morning of our stay. 

This is one of the best breakfast buffets I have ever experienced. They have the treasured smoked ham that I always seek out when I am in Vegas.  They even had portuguese sausage the first day we were there!

I really did a disservice to myself by not walking around to all the sections of the breakfast buffet before picking something to eat; finally on the third breakfast there, my boyfriend took me by the hand and we walked the entire buffet.  They have a meats and cheeses section that reminds me of a traditional european breakfast (one of my favorites!), fruit, an omelette/egg bar, cereal, breads, waffles bar, pancakes, breakfast sausage, bacon, and even featured biscuits and gravy!  The gravy for the biscuits and gravy was a bit on the sweet side for me, but you could tell it was quality and had the right consistency.  Each morning they featured something different. 

The omelettes were one of my favorites... The chef perfectly prepared the omelettes so they not only look beautiful but the cheese is perfectly melted within the omelette.

I love the variety and the freshness of this buffet and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"One of the less expensive buffets. Food was okay, and there was a good selection. Skip the St. Louis style ribs if you are even remotely familiar with what good BBQ is supposed to be. The free beer and wine (for 21 and over) included in the price made it worth it."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast on a Wednesday morning.  Nothing that says wow.  Just your basic breakfast fare like eggs, sausage potatoes.  They have congee but nothing else out of the ordinary.  I was expecting a lot more but it seems like all the same stuff that you get from Hometown Buffet.  Quality really isn't that much better in my opinion.  Service wasn't that great either.  It took a while to get a refill of my drinks and even then they messed up my order.

All in all with the abundance of options in Vegas, I will not be returning to Cravings anytime time soon.  I should have stuck with my initial urge and went to the Bellagio Buffet instead."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite buffet in Vegas but it changed. Now it is self serve drinks, unlimited beer and wine which is fine...but the food isn't what it used to be. There isn't as much variety. I wish they brought back the BBQ duck station."}
{"text":"Heard that this was buffet underwent renovation and a change in their menu. I was pleased that the buffet came with open bar (on select beer & wine).  Although my lunch meal was free, I felt that this buffet was alright.  Nothing too special.  The asian dumplings, french toast, and lobster ravioli was pretty good.  Other than that, just a typical buffet.  The Buffet at the Wynn was better and worth my money!"}
{"text":"Took the family out for some pre-Mother's day celebration. Everyone wanted to try a new place for brunch so Cravings here we come. I like the food. My favorite was the dimsum, grilled fish, and omellete station. I had shrimp cocktail and snow crab legs (which was already cut in half for easy access to the crab meat). They did have a lot of dishes to choose from and I was glad we came here. The desserts awesome. Tried the peach crepe and loved the gelatos."}
{"text":"The food choices weren't the best and the food itself was cold. My husband got the prime rib and it was hard and cold. I would have to say it was really disappointing but since we are staying here at the mirage we wanted to try the buffet. Compared to Cesar's or even the buffet at the stratosphere I wouldn't pay this price again. I've never been so disappointed at a buffet and seeing how big it was I was positive it would be a good one. Boy I was wrong."}
{"text":"Buffets are nightmares for people with food allergies, so I went into this with really really low expectations (thinking I'll eat a lot of salad). I was really surprised when the chef walked me around the entire buffet and told me exactly what I could and could not eat. The results really shocked me. 

It is expensive per person (which didn't surprise me much since literally everything in Vegas is overpriced). When we were seated, I asked to speak to the chef about my allergies and they couldn't find him. It took about 20 minutes, but while we waited the manager and host came in to check every so often to let us know they were still looking, etc and hadn't forgotten about us. When he did come, he was super nice and took us around the entire buffet to show me what I could eat with my gluten and dairy allergy. As in, he literally pointed to every single item of food in the whole place and said yes or no. There was a lot more than I thought. They actually had quite a few gluten free options. The pasta station has GF pasta and a separate pot of water so they don't cross contaminate. The Mexican station has corn tortillas upon request (just make sure you get a person that is used to working that station so they wipe down the grill before grilling them!!), at the Asian station, they can make you noodle dishes without soy sauce (they use rice noodles). They have some varieties of sushi, and he said he could make some things that weren't usually put out. They even have GF bread behind the salad station upon request. There are GF desserts, too, however, they all have dairy in them. The chef even said that if there wasn't anything that looked appetizing or to my liking, to come find him and he'd make whatever I want. He was really kind and accommodating. I ate too much, which isn't usually a thing at a buffet. 

I didn't actually eat much from the seafood section, although they did have a large variety. All of the seafood just looked kind of sad at that time. I don't think I'm daring enough to eat oysters in the desert that look like they've been sitting out all day..."}
{"text":"once in a while, i would come to Mirage's cravings. Though it may not be the BEST buffet like the wynn or bellagio, or even the rio, Cravings is pretty darn good for the price you pay. There's a reason why Cravings is much cheaper than the buffets at the wynn or bellagio. They dont have King crab legs, the have snow crabs and dungeness crab. They dont  have rack of lambs. They do have prime ribs. And they have other varieties - not great...but it's alright. 

Their dessert buffet, however, is a disappointment. there's nothing that i want to really eat. THe best thing about their dessert is their gelato ice cream section. 

Cravings is nothing like the big buffets, but it is way better than other buffets such as monte carlo, circus, flamingo, etc. In my book of vegas buffet.. I'd say Mirage's buffet is the mid-class buffet. Cravings is a good choice if u dont want to spend the extra 20 on a higher class buffet.. or dont feel like eating too much at the same time dont want to pay the same amount of price at a dine-in restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok, so I haven't been to Cravings in over a decade. A LOT has changed. They falsely advertise on THEIR OWN website that on Saturday and Sunday their is unlimited champagne. NO WHERE does it say it's an additional cost. And NO ONE offered it when we paid. Although the did ask if we wanted to leave a tip. I chose to, BIG MISTAKE!! Tip for what? You get your own drinks and own food. Last time they at least filled your drinks for you. This time, the attendant only pointed us toward the bar (which you really can't miss) and removed about 5 dishes from our table. For 18%. You have to do better than that for 18%!! Cravings, you let us down big time. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"The worst Buffet I've been to in Las Vegas. 

0/5 Service: Service could've been a lot better, In a group of 8 plates tend to stack up and our buser was no where to be found. Drinks ran low, also they were stingy on the napkins. Seriously for $29.99 I expected a lot better. 

0/5 Food: Wish I had good comments to say about the food but no. The food lacked flavor and the meat cuts has a lot of fat or they were over salted. The seafood section lacked everything. You could tell the grab legs were very thin, dry, and just tasted rubbery. They had small little shot glasses of different shrimps like, shrimp cocktail, shrimp cevice, nothing tasted $29.99.

0/5 Price: $29.99 + tax + gratuity. They must know their buffet sucks because they charge you gratuity at the door. This place is definitely NOT WORTH IT.  

2/5 Desert: The desert area was very modern and cute probably the only thing good about this place is that it had Gelato and a good amount of variety of choices. 

0/5 Ambiance: I felt this buffet was rather small, and definitely not worth it. For 29.99 Dinner I expected a lot more varieties of foods from different cultures but this buffet lacked everything. It was DIRTY, flies were flying around my table as we dined. Very annoying and disgusting. How does a fly get in a casino anyways?"}
{"text":"Nothing against the staff or the hotel. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. ITS THE FOOD. It's terrible. The quality is comparable to hometown buffet or Golden Corral but you're paying $30 a person. The only thing they got going on here is the unlimited beer and wine that comes with the buffet, maybe so you could get drunk enough to not care how the food taste. Don't waste your time and go spend a little more for a better quality buffet. I should've listened to the previous reviews. Don't make the same mistake I did!"}
{"text":"This place has a \"to-go\" option -- if you are by yourself, this is a great, semi-cheap option of getting buffet type food in a box :)  I got mashed potatos, salad, bacon and mini cupcakes, rice crispy treats. #happytime"}
{"text":"lousy. had a hard time finding enough to fill a plate. blah. don't waste your money. Worst meal I had in Las Vegas. Hands down. I wasn't alone. The rest of my party felt ripped off and wished we'd gone anywhere else! For a great Vegas buffet, check out the buffet in the Rio!"}
{"text":"Basic buffet with basic buffet food. Good. Not great, but for 19.99 (weekday breakfast) it was fresh, convenient, and a good value. Also included some cheap unlimited wine and beer.

Includes regular breakfast fare, made to order egg station, carving station, smoke salmon, and pizzas. It's not gourmet but don't expect that and it's just fine."}
{"text":"I've been to the buffet at Wynn and I've been to Wicked Spoon. While both are spectacular choices, I think one of the biggest drawbacks of both of them is that the wait is pretty long. It can be anywhere between 40 minutes to 1.5 hours.

You'll never had such a wait at cravings. Since we didn't want to wait that long and we needed some sort of sustenance to soak up all the excess alcohol we drank the night before, we decided to be efficient and go to the buffet downstairs from the Mirage, where we stayed this weekend.

We arrived there around 10:30a and zipped pass the cashier since there was no line! For $28, which is $10 less than Wynn and Wicked,  we got not only entry into the buffet, but unlimited mimosas.

While I wouldn't say the choice selection here is that big of a range, they did have all I wanted from a buffet. Smoked salmon, check. King crab legs, check. Prime rib, check! But one of the greatest things I discovered at this buffet was that they had Bouillabaisse!! The soup was prepared pretty well, while it doesn't compare to what I had in Marseilles in 2010, it sure hit the spot in my stomach and evoked many great memories from my time in Europe!

Overall, Cravings is an underrated buffet you should consider if you don't want to wait at Wynn or Wicked. 4 stars and definitely returning again!"}
{"text":"only reason why we came here is because the 4 of us had our meals were comped thanks to mlife~

service is great - they're constantly refilling your drinks and taking your plates as soon as you are done eating.  

food is not so great - food was either stale, old, recooked, or just not so fresh.  the only thing memorable was their clam chowder.

dessert is a total fail - really dry and not so good. except, their mango sorbet (in the ice cream section) was actually okay.

unfortunately, i don't think we'll be back....unless they make some improvements."}
{"text":"This place from a 1-10 is about a 8. Great price approx $ 40 for 2 people. Free beer and wine.  You can't beat paying 
$40 x2 people for delicious prime rib.  All u can drink wine and beer.  Nice people great service. They have- Latin, American, Carvings, sushi, salads, desserts, Italian, Chefs kitchen for omelette, beverages. Come with empty stomachs."}
{"text":"$30 for dinner.  Probably the worst buffet I have ever been to.  I only ate 2 plates and ice cream.  The next day, I weighed myself and lost a pound."}
{"text":"I really liked this buffet. Almost everything I tried, I liked. There was a lot of flavor and a variety of foods from different places available. Dessert choices were pretty good too. I even took a few cookies back to my room to eat the next day. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Had an Mlife B1G1 so we stopped here for breakfast. Alcohol was included with the buffet which was awesome for mimosas. Drinks are self serve. There's the regular omelet station, and also some dinner food too. Service was nice, maybe a little overbearing but nice. There's quite a bit of room to move around and the tables were fairly spread out."}
{"text":"We went here because we were staying at the Mirage and were too lazy to go anywhere else.  As far as the Las Vegas destination-buffets go, this is not a good one.  The food quality and presentation are significantly below the level of the competition.  That being said, the $25 cost for Sunday all-you-can eat and drink Champagne buffet is actually pretty cheap.   And after a few glasses of Champagne, the food really isn't that bad ... it's the \"beer goggle\" effect. only with food!"}
{"text":"Even though I hate buffets, when in Vegas ....

Cravings is fine for what it is. We came twice during our stay pretty late in the morning (close to 11am) so we were there when they started the switch from all breakfast food to lunch items as well. The french toast was really good (probably my favorite). I love omelettes but the ones here were just OK. It's all made to order and the station was really slow, almost waited 15 minutes one morning because the cook couldn't work on more than 2 pans at a time even though there were 5 burners.

They have different stations from friend chicken and southern type food, Chinese food, sushi, Caribbean (the plantains were delicious) and so forth. You definitely won't leave hungry and beer and wine is included!"}
{"text":"The bf and I came back to this buffet during a recent Vegas trip because he was in love with the prime rib and I was in love with this mocha mousse.

To our disappointment, the buffet did not live up to our memories of it. Especially since we began our night with the SNOOTIEST front desk cashier. So snooty that I actually looked at her name tag, so beware of SHIRLEY!

Anyway - on to the food: the salmon skin rolls were not very fresh. The prime rib was not as tender(but still relatively good). And my beloved mocha mousse was nowhere to be found (the desserts that were there didn't actually make up for it).

The rest of the displayed dishes were either uninteresting or average. The best thing I remember having here was the Italian Meatball Soup which was excellent. And our waiter was also very good.

Out of the 6 buffets I've been to on the strip I would rate Cravings as #3 MAYBE #4. Behind The Wynn & Rio and possibly tied with the MGM(only had the lunch buffet so tough to compare)"}
{"text":"I am not sure why there are so many low ratings here but let me tell you my impressions.

It is a little pricey but with the dinner service you get all you can eat crab legs (snow crab) and all of the legs are cut in half for easy and quick access to the meat.   They do have claws but they are not cut (probably due to the thickness of the shell) but every waitstaff has crackers if you ask for it.   
Drinks are self serve and are one of those machines that has every flavor and lots of different choices.   The Chinese food is not so great but maybe that is a function of me eating in the large Asian community next to las vegas and food there is so good.

The dessert bar is so good and full of choices.   They also have a pasta bar where they will make you fresh pasta exactly to your specifications.

It is one of my favorite buffets in las vegas and I have eaten at many that were just huge disappointments."}
{"text":"Huge buffet with many choices, reasonably priced and included all you can drink house wine or beer! It's not the best buffet that I've been to but definitely isn't the worst either. I would definitely recommend it to someone who's looking for a reasonably priced buffet!"}
{"text":"One of the better buffets on the strip for your money. Especially with the unlimited beer and wine. There are so many food options and always fresh. I have never been disappointed going here. The staff is very friendly and the bartender was awesome- we stopped for a brunch and he made us \"mimosa's\" with OJ and Moscato tasted just like the real deal."}
{"text":"There are much better buffets in Vegas at the same price or just a little higher.  A few plus points were the shrimp cocktail and shrimp louie.  The bbq pork bun out of the noodle (your guess is as good as mine) station was pretty good.  They have wonton noodles, but it's not made on order so it sits there soggy.  :(  The sushi looks awful and the Chinese food, even worse.  The rest of the food is passable.  The desserts are displayed inside fridges which make the presentation seem more cafeteria than $30 buffet.  Server was a big plus though.  Always checking on us and making sure we didn't miss anything in the buffet or in Vegas itself."}
{"text":"One of the few buffets I've been to where there's a huge selection to choose from and EVERYTHING is delicious"}
{"text":"We went here unexpectedly, after getting a comp for a major screw-up on the part of the Mirage.  This let us bypass the long line.  Yesssss!

This was a first visit to Cravings, and it was a pleasant adventure.  I like the way the food was arranged, in niches, so that a few steps brought another semi-hidden surprise.  I ordered a glass of wine and was happy to see that the prices were very reasonable.

I bypassed all the carvings and the meats; we were seated near the desserts, so by the time I made my way to those sections, I was stuffed to the gills.  (Buffets never lose money on me, even when I'm paying).  But my husband and the other couple we were with made up for my shortcomings.  One of them raved about the prime rib, and the other thought the turkey was delicious.  But I loved everything I did try, especially the buffalo chicken salad, the beet, apple and orange salad, sushi cones, and the butternut squash and jalapeno soup.  I probably would have loved more, but my stretch denims were stretched out as far as they could go.

The only thing that didn't warm my heartstrings was the gelato for dessert.  I got chocolate, and it tasted ordinary and not very chocolate-y.  In their defense, though, I did put a dab of the warm chocolate lava cake on top of it.  The cake was so over-the-top chocolate-y that it may have masked the flavor of the gelato.

I'm not a big fan of buffets and generally try to avoid them.  This visit to Cravings was worth waddling for."}
{"text":"Completely mediocre food and surly service...this just isn't how I remembered a buffet in Las Vegas.  None of the food was great, but there was a lot of it.  The seafood was obviously frozen; I had to rip the crab legs apart with a fork and knife because there the cracker thing would only bend the shell, it was so saturated with water.  The bacon was undercooked and greasy, the sushi tasteless, the prime rib overdone, etc.  There was nothing there I would eat again.  I was really unimpressed, and my two dining companions were also less than thrilled.  It was 75 bucks for the three of us, and it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Mirage has always had a nice buffet, and continues to do so.  The restaurant is clean, offers a diverse variety of ethnic foods, and nice high-end choice of food.  I wouldn't say it's the best, but it's definitely well above average.  Bon apetit!"}
{"text":"Lots of choices and unlimited wine and beer. They had American, Latin, Italian, Asian cuisines. Would be good if they added Indian next."}
{"text":"Amazing seafood station and latin station, also a great eggs benedict according to my girlfriend. They have the multi option touch screen soda machines and unlimited beer and wine!"}
{"text":"We ate here for brunch before we left to go back home. It was 25$ for lunch with tax it came out to be like 27 something. Champagne comes with the meal though =)

We got seated fairly quickly. Our waitress seemed serious, but she cracked a lot of jokes. Although sometimes it took quiet a while for us to get our drinks. 

The eggs benedict was to die for! that was like the only thing that I liked besides the melted butter that you eat with the crab. The asian food had no taste. It was so bland.

We ended up staying a little more than 2 hours. we stayed so long that everyone that was there when we were there were gone and everyone around us were new o.O no one looked familiar LOL. we're FAT."}
{"text":"Seriously the best buffet ever! Not just cause of the food but the staff and chefs are the most amazing down to earth people ever! My family and my sisters family come to Vegas once a year. We always end up going to a buffet at least once while we are here. Today we picked the Mirage. One reason is that my 9 year old nephew has food allergies. Severely. My sister called ahead of time to make sure they had food that was safe for him. The chef she spoke to was Endhir. He was super friendly! We get there and the staff was sooooooooo beyond amazing that we decided to only come to this buffet from now on! 
Our waitress was Diane, oh my gosh! So very sweet! She makes you feel right at home! She didn't let us get up to get our drinks she was so kind. And the chef Remy came out to meet my sister and talk to her about my nephews allergies. Took the time to walk around the whole buffet to look at foods he can eat and to tell my sister what the food was cooked in. He personally made him his own pizza and French fries and took out a new dish of bacon with clean tongs for him. He gave us his card so we can call ahead of time for him to make my nephews food which was so amazingly kind of him to do. When we were leaving my nephew wanted to thank him and I just wanted to cry because he was so kind and it just warms my heart when people are so kind and understanding of his allergies. We usually have a hard time because it can be frustrating. But Remy & Diane were really amazing and appreciate them so much!"}
{"text":"Definitely have been to better buffets only saving grace was the unlimited wine and beer but the beer selection sucks, only 2 choices bud light our house island ipa.
The food very mediocre, crab legs very dry, pizza was good, some Asian egg rolls and dumplings. Latin food was chips, guac, nacho cheese really nachos? There was nothing here that was like man I'm glad I chose this.
Mashes really disgusting is they charge 22 dollars for a 5yr old, really? Just crazy a kid that young should be no more than half an adult and even 16 is pricey for someone that young.
Definitely would not return and not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This was the only buffett that I hit up while in vegas.. bummer I know.. haha and both times I wasnt in tip top shape to eat. The first time I was hung over and I could only eat one plate and the 2nd time I was too tired and wasnt in the mood to drink my unlimited champagne or bloody marys.. SO UPSETTING i know.. i really let myself down this trip haha. It was priced perfectly and they had a huge selection of food. Hell they even had pho up in this spot. Their sushi sucked.. but their deserts and salads were awesome. I really recommend going here.. its a good place to check out if your on a budget and want some good food. I was on a budget due to all the freakin money i lost hahaha."}
{"text":"This place is by far the worst buffet I have been to in Vegas. The service and food combined adds to a negative experience. The boyfriend and I came here for brunch on a weekend because we purchased the Travelzoo deal online. What a mistake. 

Attitude from the cashier up front and then charging us $1.58 for taxes after the voucher. Are you kidding me? Ugh. Got seated to some uncleaned tables. They probably just wiped it once and set the utensils. The waiter finally walks by after about 10 minutes of sitting and says \"What do you want to drink?\" \"Umm.. good morning to you too. What do you have?\" \"What do you want?\" .....Well, orange juice it is...

The food was very mediocre. Eggs Benedict was bland. Sausage patties were hard. Salad was warm. Soup was watered-down. It was a disaster. 

I do not plan to come back."}
{"text":"We like to stay at Mirage when we are in Las Vegas - so eating at Cravings is convenient... fortunately for me, I also like it.

For $20 they provide a great selection of food choices.  Including Mexican, Asian, Seafood and American.  Its a good deal considering there is a lot of options and the quality of food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Buffets don't usually do it for me.  I like variety but I feel pressure to eat my money's worth, even if it's not that much money.  I am not always in the mood for the pricier stuff, much to my mother's dismay.  I'll skip the crab legs in favor of something that doesn't require me to crack shells with my hand, for example.  

Also, I usually expect the food to be mediocre.  I was pleasantly surprised at Cravings.  There was a lot of variety and it was stuff I'd actually eat.  I did have some crab legs because they were already cut in half so i didn't have to work to eat my food.  I also ate prime rib to make my mommy proud.  Everything I ate was pretty good to very tasty and everyone who served us was great.

Full disclosure: We ate here twice.  I'll try some other buffets next time."}
{"text":"I give one star because the only thing I ate that was good was the omelette. I mean you can't mess up a bacon and spinach omelette...can you? Everything else was disgusting, tasteless, bland, flavorless and just down right gross. I only tried this place because it was part of the runner perks for the Rock and Roll marathons, so it wasn't a first choice for buffet. Now I know where to NOT go. The \"waiters\" are not even waiters, they are just busboys. You have to grab your own drink, they don't even bring it for you, including sodas, teas, beer and drinks at the bar, you get yourself. All they do is pick up your plates. So basically its not too much service on their end. It's sad because there alot of food here, but they are all horrible. Pick another place!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is really pretty average. We were staying at the mirage and had 2 free buffet passes with our reservation so of course we were going to check it out. We went for breakfast and they have a little bit of everything available including your standard breakfast items but also offer bagel and lox, charcuterie and cheese, pizza, desserts, an omelette station and more. Service was great but most of the food was rather bland and mass produced tasting. I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to make a stop here but if you are staying at the hotel and have free passes it is obviously worth it."}
{"text":"I first ate at Cravings Buffet in 2011 and was in love with this buffet. I thought the food was excellent. I went again a few times over the next year or two and thoroughly enjoyed my meal each time. In the past year or so, I've been to Cravings and have been disappointed. It's just not as good as it once was. I doubt I'll be back again for a long time, if ever.

A lot of people dislike having to walk so far to fill up their plate, but that's not what bugs me about this buffet. I was there a few weeks ago and, just like it was 6-7 months ago when I was there last, the food just wasn't good. The ribs were flavorless, the clam chowder tasted like it came straight out of a can, and the sushi wasn't any better. 

There are better buffets at equal or cheaper prices in Vegas. I used to brag about this buffet, but I can't recommend it anymore."}
{"text":"Das Dinner-Buffet im Mirage bietet neben den Speisen und alkoholfreien Getränken auch Wein und Bier im Gesamtpreis an. Die Räumlichkeit ist überschaubar und durch den verlegten Teppich hält sich die Lautstärke im Raum angenehm in Grenzen. Die Büffetauslagen sind, um den Sitzbereich herum, in verschiedene Speisezonen unterteilt. Die Getränke müssen zum einen an einer Bar (Alkohol) und zum Anderen an zwei Getränkebereichen selbst geholt werden. Die Bedienung räumt \"nur\" die Tische ab. Das Essen selbst war aus meiner Sicht OK, das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis hat gestimmt, vor allem wenn man die Getränke mit in Betracht zieht, die man in anderen Buffets extra bezahlen muss. Die Auslagen waren während unseres Aufenthalts immer voll, es wurde regelmässig nachgelegt und unsere Speisen waren warm."}
{"text":"Meh...food is ok, service removing plates from table was good.  The choices were not that alluring.  In the Latin area there were nacho chips???  I liked the Asian noodles and beef with peppers, and the tiramisu dessert.  My husband enjoyed the prime rib. Neither of us liked the crab legs, they were split in half and didn't have much flavor.  At least, this was included in our stay here at the Mirage.  I would NEVER pay for this buffet."}
{"text":"After a rigorous (not really...) cost/value comparison across different Vegas buffets, we decided to come to Cravings.  Mimosa brunch was calling!

Word of Warning: It is tempting to heap your plate full of food, but keep in mind (I made this mistake) food gets COLD on your plate and stays HOT in the serving area!  I piled my plate up with too much food my first time around, and it cooled off as I was making my way through it.   So disappointing.

The food itself was pretty good, I sampled a bit of everything and nothing was bad.  I kept going back to the congee though, it was just so damn comforting.  I also may or may not have had an entire plate of bacon.  It's just how I roll...

Service was fine, our waitress kept my mimosa glass full so I can't complain!  (They walk around with bottles of champagne alongside water pitchers and top you off...so after a little bit you it's just champagne with very little OJ).  Unlimited bloody marys is another option (same price as mimosas)."}
{"text":"We were disappointed in this buffet. The selections were slim and the food that was available was over cooked. We tried ever station. The crab legs were so over cooked that they were burnt in the inside. The steak from carving station was very dry. The fried rice was awful I couldn't even eat it! 
I would of given 1 star but they do offer wine and beer and is included. The alcohol and the dessert were the only good things. Not worth the price. :( 
Our first trip to Vegas and our first night here, so disappointed! I was my birthday dinner too!"}
{"text":"Been starving for 2 days and finally decided to try this buffet out.. I really love the variety of foods only thing that disappointed me was the red velvet cake was brown and there was only 3 different types of sushi rolls"}
{"text":"First time eating at this buffet. I've tried others in Vegas like the Las Vegas Hilton, Le Village Buffet at Paris and I must say I was disappointed. I found that the buffet had ALOT of options, I found myself with 6+ things on my plate per trip but the taste was bland. Nothing stuck out or made me get seconds. Even the Gelato was weak. I was definitely disappointed, huge! Especially for the price.  You're better off hitting a nicer buffet for a few dollars extra like Paris' buffet or getting a nice dinner at Mirage's Deli."}
{"text":"The thing that struck me about the buffet is the cashier who serviced us. She offered us a discount by asking if we were military or auto club members. So we showed our auto club cards. What a nice gesture. The food selection is great and the weekend brunch had bottomless mimosas of course"}
{"text":"We started off one morning at the Cravings buffet at the Mirage after we received a BOGO free voucher from our Mlife accounts. We got there a quarter to 10, which was perfect timing because they transition from breakfast to brunch at 10. We still had time to pick up some of the breakfast offerings they took away for the more lunch-y options.

The majority of the food was mediocre. However, there were some nice things. For example, the pepper steak, bouillabaisse, prime rib, shrimp cocktail, and chimichurri were good. The raspberry tarts at the dessert section were good, too. However more often than not, we found ourselves not finishing our food to save room for other things at the buffet that might be better.

For the price, we basically got two all-you-can-eat tickets for $25, which is great for Vegas. However if given the chance, we would not go back again."}
{"text":"One of the best buffets in Vegas, in my book. Cravings is noticeably cheaper than Belagio and Paris...but WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY...DID I say WAY better than Paris. The food runs the selection from salads and cold sandwiches to Chinese Bao (Steamed buns) to French duck and even American BBQ. Quality is high for any buffet...and the layout doesn't make you feel like a part of the buffet, but lets you enjoy it.
Get your buffet on!"}
{"text":"The food isn't as great as the buffet at Wicked Spoon or Bellagio's..I bought a travelzoo deal and yea it's for two people and you get 2 wines, but still..the food is eh and not very great in quality. I do like how they have a sugar free dessert bar, but the ice cream was super watery that it melts once it's inside your bowl. The Chinese food pretty much sucked..the crabs weren't bad, I suppose the only thing I liked was the cauliflower and the pork siu mai..lots of salad selection though, so if you're into salad, sure why not..

I def wouldn't recommend this place nor would I ever want to go back. A bit of a disappointment and the line was a bit long and confusing because I wasn't sure where the line even started."}
{"text":"$35 per person (dinner)

well, the food is your typical buffet food...most of the food were below average. I am kind disappointed they could't use some better ingredients.

Chinese station- 
eggplant- super salty
seafood bun (my friend tried it and warned us not to get it)
dumpling in the noodle soup (my friend tried it said ok, noodle and dumpling not as mushy as we thought since it's not made to order)                              

Latin Station- pork chop- overcooked, dry and salty

Japanese station- sushi- horrible (old and cold rice, not so fresh fish)
seaweed salad- average
                                 
Carving station: Salmon- overcooked
                          Prime rib- overcooked and really bad quality of meat

Salad station- make your own salad

Everything is fresh and the woman worked behind the counter was really nice. However they don't have any special ingredient not even arugula. 
Dressing is pretty standard too. 

sauteed vegetables or salad from different stations were all not bad.  

Mac n cheese- super marshy  (couldn't finish it)

crackers with few different choices of cheese- standard

hummus with super cold display like pita bread- standard

Dessert station- nothing looks very appetizing. 
cream brulee- the caramelized top was such a failure. It tasted like soft syrup layer float on top of it. We normally like cream brulee but it's just bad no one want to get another one.. 
cookie- alright, your typical cookie.
As I remembered the buffet at M resort or Pala were way better for the dessert option. 

Drink station: iced tea and coffee, standard. The machine made it difficult to make iced coffee your own.

also they have unlimited beer and wine if you drink. 

Didn't try anything else. I actually forgot to try the crab legs and cocktail shrimps!

I am quite disappointed the quality of food here that probably not even compare to those casino buffet near LA. Service was fast and nice though. 

My friend got resort credit for $75 and had 2 buy one get one free deal from MyVegas so the meal was basically free. 

But if you have to pay for it...avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"I will not be coming back to this establishment until MGM Resorts revises their parking fiasco.  While the buffet was worth the drive to the strip, there are similar if not better buffets on the strip that do not charge for parking.   If you're going to pay those prices, you might as well get the premium buffet experience.

For the former price, this buffet was great, but add on parking fees, and it is NOT worth it!  I will not be back, I will not be bringing visitors, I will not be recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We were starving... But the food was \"eh\" at best. Endless mimosas always make things better but it was pre mixed (weak) and refill was SLOW. Loved the cheesecake!"}
{"text":"We ate here twice on our recent trip and really enjoyed both visits. Our first was the most memorable both for the food and definitely the price. It's nice that beer & champagne are included and all you can drink. The mimosas was very STRONG!

Apparently Friday is considered a weekend in Vegas and therefore the price almost doubled. It was made a little easier by the fact that they accepted our AAA card which provided us a 20% discount.

One benefit was that the extra price came with lunch options as well. We enjoyed Asian, seafood, sushi, Mexican & Italian along with the standard breakfast items.

The crab legs were just ok and the chicken fried steak was too salty but the bacon, Belgium waffle, chow mein, desserts and carving stations were crazy good. I also loved that they had non fat milk. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again if we weren't staying at the Mirage but if you're really wanting to eat and get a large selection of choices - this place is a great choice."}
{"text":"Did buffet breakfast yesterday  6-18-18.
Ordered Omelette, I liked it but I'm not a picky eaters.  I was surprised at limited breakfast item available for breakfast.  I didn't like the idea that I had to go get the coffee.   Nothing much to say about service since it's a buffet."}
{"text":"Excellent buffet for the price. You have your choice of Italian, Asian, Mediterranean, and good ole American. From a breakfast chef to a carving chef, there's so many items to choice from. They have a self serve beverage area from hot teas, coffee, hot chocolate to cappuccino machines, you can't go wrong. There's a juice machine as well as a full service bar. If you can think it for a drink they have it. You will leave this buffet very satisfied! I would suggest the best time to eat would be before 10am, because after that it gets crowded. Overall this is an excellent place for groups or just two people. The wait staff and servers are friendly. If you have an Triple A card or serve in the military you get a big discount, you have to let them know because some of the cashiers won't say anything. We saved $12 for being a Triple A member."}
{"text":"Somehow my family always ends up on Vegas for Christmas Eve/holidays...so I've had my fair share of buffets from The Buffet to Wicked Spoon.

Cravings is definitely not a top-tier buffet on the level of quality and \"gourmet\" like WS or TB as I mentioned above. BUT what they lack in Vegas-status-quality, they have in quantity and affordable pricing! I HIGHLY recommend visiting tix4dinner at any of their booths on The Strip, or calling them and asking about their discounted buffet prices because our family of four saved $40 by getting our discounted buffet dinner on Christmas Eve! IT'S NOT SHADY, trust me!

Anyways, for about $27/per person for our Christmas Eve dinner, we waited for only 30 minutes (we were in the early end of the line) and THUS BEGAN THE FEAST. Cravings is well known for their UNLIMITED wine and beer...but they only have Goose Island IPA, Bud Light, and a red/white/pink from Libery Creek. OPEN BAR, ANYONE?! HAHA, but seeing as it was dinner, our family kept the vino flowing all night. It wasn't bad, but it was definitely average wine. No complaints over here, as it paired really well with my favorites: pasta bar (Astes was the BEST pasta chef--and she was so easy to talk to and really kept a positive attitude during her shift), steamed crab legs, the veggie spring rolls, and OF COURSE dessert. Faves were the cheesecake (I HAD THREE!!), fruit tart, and various cupcakes. Cookies were HELLA stale (UM EW) and the gelato was so watery it melted when I walked all the way to the opposite end of the room where our table was...sad.

I would TOTALLY come back here again. I mean, I've waited for over an HOUR at Wicked Spoon for dinner a few years back...and grant it, the food was definitely over the top and I felt spoiled rotten, BUT I wouldn't pay $80/per person when I can just get FULL AND BUFFET'D at Cravings for $27/per person with the same types of foods!! GO CRAVINGS, it's totally underrated."}
{"text":"The only thing that we had that was 1/2 decent were the crab legs & the unlimited beer.  Everything else was basically the quality of a Golden Coral.  We've now tried 2 buffet's in Vegas on 2 different trips.  Needless to say ... we won't be trying another one during our next trip."}
{"text":"This places options are SUPER limited...it's over priced  by far!!!! $35 bucks and there were not many options for me. Will not come back!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would! For the price please go and pay the same at bellagio for much better food! I mean how can u mess up pizza? The desserts tasted like they have been sitting out for two days. Every one we tried was falling apart and dry. The only thing that was good was the pineapple and the ice tea! Please save ur money and spend it at bellagio or aria if you are looking for a good buffet where you actually want 2nds!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of buffets....but I think Cravings is by far my favorite buffet in Vegas!!!  I love how there are soooo many options....Chinese, Mexican, Vietnamese, Italian, American, etc.....everything possible.  I love how there are several stations where you can have your food made to order - pho, wonton mein, crepes, pasta...and the list continues.

I would definitely recommend this buffet!!!"}
{"text":"I honestly think this buffet is underrated and need to be recognized. I remembered eating with my parents here for dinner and it was delicious. There was a wide selection of food and I was able to eat most of them. Their dessert section was good. I have to say I even think it is better than Wynn buffet, which have very few selections and charge double amount when you can go to Cravings. When I get a chance to be in Vegas again, I will come here for sure!"}
{"text":"This was the first buffet I have tried in Vegas, and we chose it because the Tix4Tonight crew had suggested it several times.  It just wasn't that good.  I thought that the carving station was pretty good, and the sushi was ok.  There's not a lot of attention given to the pasta and pizza.  They are just not going to change it out until it's gone, and it sits for a long time.  Crab legs were ok, but were very small.  Desserts were not good; best dessert was the frozen yogurt. How do you mess up carrot cake, people?"}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets 3 stars is for their prime rib and pasta.

Prime rib was very tender, flavorful and really melted in my mouth. Pasta was al dente and the flavors were done right, if not perfectly.

Everything else was just meh. Roasted duck was dry, not crispy, and didn't have much flavor to it. Congee was bland, lacked seasoning.

The desserts were average. Nothing really stood out other than the bread pudding, which was great.

The gf's orange juice was served in a glass with a lipstick marking on it, which was definitely not hers (she didn't even have lipstick on). That was a real bummer. The server just apologized and brought her another glass (a new one, i hope). Also, it took forever for someone to take our drink orders, we had to flag someone down to get our order. Maybe we were just impatient because we were so hungry."}
{"text":"This buffet was expensive but well worth it!  I came here with my whole family and we all found something we liked.  The ribs were wonderful, as was all of the seafood (including sushi - something I was almost not brave enough to try at a buffet).  The guacamole was delicious as were all of the salad options, and sides, including baked mac and cheese were good too. And unlimited wine and beer were included with dinner!  They weren't fancy, but for me the Chardonnay was plenty good enough."}
{"text":"Sushi station was just OK needed more than just salmon & rolls but everything else was worth the price of admission.I would go back."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious.  The only reason i give 4 instead of 5 is because i called ahead and asked if they had king crab on Wednesday night they said yes.   Got there,  paid and it was very small snow crab.  After spending so much time trying to find an affordable buffet,  and holing for king crab but not getting it i was a little disappointed.   HOWEVER. The snow crab flavor was very very good on both the steamed and the cold crab.  The sushi was very fresh and the cheese/meat station was yummy too. Top this off with unlimited beer and wine (if you like those) and you can't beat it!   DEFINITELY RECCOMMEND"}
{"text":"This review is for the SUNDAY - BRUNCH...I had really high expectations about this place, but unforunately I was very disappointed.  I was really craving breakfest food but found that most of their eggs/hashbrown etc... were either overcooked or just simply not tasty.  They had some nice shrimp cocktail here but it was sitting in this enclosed little area in the middle or nowhere...The crab legs were also very small and unpelled and required WAY to much work to be even worth it.  Their sushi, like most other vegas buffets, really didn't taste all that fresh or good either.  The only thing I enjoyed at this buffet was their prime rib, which was somewhat decent.  I also liked the fresh made omeletts too.  For $20.50, I would definetly skip this buffet and venture off to planet hollywood, belliago, wynn, or paris, as for a few bucks more you'll really see a big difference in food and quality.  I will someday try their dinner buffet and report back.

I will try the dinner buffet and see how it o"}
{"text":"Very good food.  Very good selections .  Very nicely displayed.  But,. pricey !!!!
$35.  is a lot of money.  It includes Beer & Wine.  Big deal.  I was super tired,. super hungry, so I went.  I did really enjoy everything I had.  I guess things have just gotten more expensive."}
{"text":"The food is not fresh at all. Going near the fishmonger section is scary despite my love of sea food. Came with family because I remember this place being far better a few years back but came out disappointed."}
{"text":"It is a older hotel so you don't think of going there for the buffet right of the bat.  We somehow ended up here and the buffet was pretty good.  Not the largest selection but of what they offered everything was good quality (that's what really matters).  I was pleasantly surprised.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Last Friday, there were massive lines at two of our favorite Strip buffets (Bellagio and Cosmopolitan). As a last resort we  tried Cravings, which is the buffet in the Mirage. Based on this experience, I jacked up the ratings a star.
  The neat thing about Cravings is that there has never been lines on my visits. I was thinking that it is unpopular. Not the case. The place is huge, which eliminates wait times.
  I have experienced many buffets, and the food was quality. Maybe, the deserts could be better. The live Asian station serves fantastic won ton soup. 
  All in all the food tasted good. The server was on top of refills.
  Oh. And it costs around $28. As a local, Cravings is a good treat once in awhile."}
{"text":"I paid $150 for 3 kids and 2 adults.  The \"crab legs\" looked more like mosquito legs.  Sushi was so hard or old, I don't know.  I wasted my money for a terrible food.  No more buffets for me..."}
{"text":"Absolutely good bang for the bucks! This buffet is located in the center of Vegas but only charges about $20 for a hearty lunch! They have a vast selection of food and beverage, nothing really fancy or terrific but it's decent enough, and you can eat till your stomach explodes if you want to. Asian food was better than average when I was there. Calming decor is an additional plus. Try it at least once!"}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars base on value and selection. While it's not perfection like the other more expensive places, mid tier price  for a average dinner was good. Selection was great, lots to choose from, multiple selections of soups, and the usual prime rib, crab legs, and shrimp was above average. the desert bar could do with more selections. But good stable quality over the years."}
{"text":"If this is all you do in Vegas then that is fine. Me and my bf sat here for 2 hours and got about 5 plates each. Not a food on them was disappointing. Hands down the best buffet I have eaten so far in my life"}
{"text":"Blah! Blah! Blah!  My hubby and I came here with such high expectations after reading/ hearing all the reviews... and boy were we ever disappointed... infact my hubby got kind of quesy after eating here and we returned to our hotel to sleep it off...
Yet another buffet that I will not be coming to in Vegas"}
{"text":"I came here a few years ago and also recently. I have to say it is such a disappointment. This time around, the food was lower quality, they ask you to purchase a bottomless mimosa menu when you can have AYCD beer and wine but no one tells you. The food here was pretty mediocre. We got myvegas points here, so it was buy one get one free, which was still not a great deal. I would not suggest this place but rather suggest wicked spoon."}
{"text":"We loved this buffet! Loved the arrangement of food by ethnicity. Italian over there, Chinese, over here, etc. Great sweet n sour chicken, hand rolls, split crab legs, shrimp cocktail, pizza, mexican bar, amazing plantains, great dessert bar, complete with gelato station and to-die-for macaroons. Great food, and so many choices. Sushi was ok, but thats how it is in every other buffet, except Todai... Omg. Thats a whole seperate review.. Lol."}
{"text":"A group of us ate here for their champagne brunch on a Sunday. The wait wasn't too bad - maybe 15 minutes to pay and get seated - but that's because this definitely isn't one of the better buffets on the Strip. That said, having not eaten at Cravings in a while, my two biggest observations are that I love what they're doing with the drinks now, but the food has definitely gone downhill since my previous experiences here.

With tax and the alcohol option, the price was about $37 per person, and I definitely got my money's worth with the mimosas :) The prime rib was pretty good (the first round I had was great, though the second round was slightly overcooked for 'medium rare'). Unfortunately the eggs benedict were low quality (mostly due to the bland Hollandaise sauce) and the pork bun I had had been sitting out so long that I couldn't take more than one bite of it. That said, the rest of the people in my group thought that their food choices were good - nothing special, but better than low-level buffet food.

Now, they used to bring drinks to the table, but at some point since my last visit to Cravings (which was, admittedly, several years ago) they added drink machines AND a full bar, which I love. No more waiting for someone to come around to fill your drinks, and since I especially drink a LOT of water, this is, to me, a far better option than drink waiter service.

And again, the fact that there wasn't a long wait like there is for the more popular/better buffets and that the alcohol option was worth it made it a great experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful place! Very good food and GREAT service! We went for brunch and it was delicious. We got a coupon / discount through the Tix4Tonight Booth. It did cost us about $15.00 for the coupon but saved us about $75.00. Above all from the cashier to the hostess to our server and bartender the service was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Lukewarm food. Nothing out of the ordinary. Sloppy serving areas. No server around to slice beef or serve gelato. Best thing was our very attentive waitress. There has to be a better buffet."}
{"text":"Based on the positive reviews of the Cravings buffet that I'd read in my Fodor's guidebook and elsewhere, my expectations for the selection and quality of food were high. They were met on the first point but not on the second. Maybe this place rates well in terms of buffets overall, and maybe I shouldn't be evaluating it on the same terms I use for rating standard made-to-order places. I thought the price was reasonable -- $17 for lunch.

I didn't mind the bright, modern decor that's apparently bothered some people. I was annoyed, though, that the hosts at the front of the restaurant wouldn't seat us right away when there were cleary open tables in the dining room, and they weren't particularly friendly about it. Our beverage waiter was great, though, ncie and attentive.

My favorite items were the andouille sausage, the steak (I can't remember the cut), the broccolini, the shrimp cocktail, and the chocolate catalan and bread pudding for dessert. I liked the fact that dim sum (primarily buns and potstickers) was offered, but it was merely adequate. And the duck in the Chinese food station was overcooked. The sushi selection wasn't particularly impressive, either. It was hard to choose what to eat, as there was such a huge selection -- that was nice.

A decent Vegas buffet option, but I'd be interested in something higher quality for my next visit."}
{"text":"One of my favorite buffets! nice variety of food choices, all were delish. Clean. Everything was replenished right away, hot, and set up into sections."}
{"text":"I had a friend visit from Kauai & she wanted to eat at a buffet & we were already at the Mirage so we decided to give Cravings a try.
I am glad we did. It was about 20 bucks each for lunch. We were seated right away and had a very nice server who was very quick with the refills. She even put our kiddos juice into a cup with lid/straw.
Its a really big buffet..alot of walking around to see all they have..which is alot. I was impressed with the spread. They had some really large shrimp and a nice BBQ section.
The only thing that was not that great was the dessert selection. But I did try the bread pudding and it was pretty good.
Next time I will come back with the hubby since I think he would really like this place."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars.  The price for dinner was $35 which was pricey for two.  The LV tour book said that it was $18 for dinner but I guess b/c it was a Sat. the price was higher.  

The husband and I tried to be strategic about what we ate - going more towards the veggies and meat and trying to avoid the carbs.  It doesn't help when the first thing in the buffet line is the pizza.  

They do offer shrimp cocktails and king crab legs which are split into two for easier eating.  Unfortunately, I couldn't enjoy the king crab legs.  My lips had an itching sensation after eating them.  The sushi, not memorable at all.  The prime rib and turkey were alright.

What I did like was the gelato they offered, fresh fruit, and the wall of baked goods.  I wish that my stomach could hold more b/c after the fruit and gelato, I was done.  Service was very attentive in refilling our drinks and taking away our used plates."}
{"text":"When I go to vegas, this will be my Sunday Brunch Dining choice!
They have everything!
-Crab
-Gelato
-Pot Stickers
-Sushi - not the best
-Breakfast foods (my fav)
-Desserts - all kinds

Great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Solid 3/5 stars overall and would return!

Atmosphere: 5/5. Very clean and very spacious! You don't feel like you're sitting on top of the table next to you (Ahem..Bellagio). 

Food selection: 5/5. Lots of choices from American food, Latin, Asian, Salad, and desserts.

Quality of Food: 3/5. That's where it gets a little hit or miss. Food is very hot and has nice presentation! However, the sushi was disappointing. Rice was on the hard side and tasted store bought.  Pizza was okay but I could get similar pizza from Pizza Hut. Soups were great, meat from the carving was great (try the ham), and the salad bar selections were awesome. I also love how MGM properties all have self serve touch screen beverage machines! No more waiting for a server to refill your drinks. Lots of juice and coffee options too!

Pricing: 1/5. I feel really ripped off. My fiancé and I went to the buffet around 11am today February 16th 2018. Normally the brunch price is around $24 per person but we were charged 75.75 for two brunch buffets (including tax). I think that's about 37 or 38 per person due to it being a holiday. I asked the person I was paying with what holiday it was today? She said she had no idea. Seems like the company just wants an excuse to charge people more money. Presidents' Day isn't until Monday. What the heck? At least educate your employees as to WHY we're paying so much more. 

Also apparently unlimited alcoholic drinks were included as I was told by the host but the selection was poor. I opted for a mimosa and it tasted like straight up white wine with a splash of orange juice. Not really what I wanted/imagined as a mimosa. Stick to the Bellagio's unlimited drink option if you're interested in that. 

Overall I would come back on a non holiday time as it was a really nice buffet. I just wish the food quality was a little bit better, but oh well!"}
{"text":"For someone who remembers when this was the class of buffets, the bland dried out $20.00 lunch was disheartening. Hope they can bring it back."}
{"text":"TOO MUCH FOOD. I always end up eating way too much at Vegas buffets. Mainly because they are so much better than ordinary buffets AND you have to eat enough to make up for the price you pay to get in. As far as Cravings go, it was alright. I ate some stuff that I wish I hadn't tried, and I ate some stuff that I loved. It's always like that at a buffet. 

I loved the layout of this buffet. It was must less hectic and cramped which I appreciated. It's clean, and typically modern and each section is divided up by the type of food it offers. My sister and I had a fun time trying each section at a time and by the time we got around to every single one, we were barely eating anything we got on our plates (bad bad bad!). I think some of my favorites were the mussels, ravioli, and the shrimp cocktails. My siblings and I also gorged on the nachos we loaded up with toppings. I would pass on the sushi because the rice was just so hard. If you're like us, you will just eat the fish and hide the rice under some other dish. If you're super Korean like my parents, you will like the fact that they serve kimchi. They had a pretty huge selection on desserts. The cupcakes are GROSS so please pass on those. Actually pretty much all the desserts were kind of unappetizing. Some of the cookies were okay but that's about it. My brothers liked the gelato they served but I was too full to try it. 

BUFFETS BUFFETS BUFFETS. I have a love hate relationship with them. My sister and I burned off most of the calories clubbing later so it's all good. 3/5"}
{"text":"Love Cravings! it is always on my list of places to eat when I visit Vegas. The M life line skip option is always great lol
The food selections are out of this world! My favorite station is the pasta station. I had a bow-tie pasta with spinach, shrimp, chicken in an Alfredo sauce and it was the best!

{"text":"Yelp should add a way to give less than one star. This place was wayyyyyy over priced. The food was not good. They serve a pizza with some veggie on it that I literally had to spit out. The desserts were all over the place and nothing really great. The Asian food should be removed all together. The fried rice was ok but that's pretty much it. The staff overall was pretty awesome. The lady who made omelette was a sweetheart as was the guy at the craving station. My waitress kind of sucked. I would not recommend this place. Paris is cheaper and light years ahead, obviously Cesar's is better and planet Hollywood. Step it up Cravings"}
{"text":"Not impressed. For the price & the food selection/quality I won't go back. It was about $70 for my dad and I on a Sunday night. The \"Asian\" area only had one or two entrees plus the rice and noodles. Only a few types of sushi. The \"Latin\" area was my favorite with tamales, fajitas, some chicken, rice and beans. BUT the rice was awful, like it was from a box. The crab and shrimp was good. I don't eat pasta but it looked decent. The carving station had prime rib and turkey with gravy, potatoes and stuffing, not impressed with the stuffing. I didn't look at the desserts but asked my dad to grab me cheesecake if they had it, he came back with a small piece saying they didn't have many choices for dessert."}
{"text":"\"Wow. Bulk City\" were the exact words of my African-Filipino-American roommate as he stepped onto the premise. I proceeded to see him stack plate after plate of remnant seafood and other ethnic delicacies. His happiness was short-lived two hours later when the overly buff creature held his gut  and writhed in pain at the amount of food he had consumed. Your time at Cravings Buffet at Mirage will be the most magnificent during, but just learn to pace yourself as with everything in life. 

There was quite the selection to choose from and is pretty standard for a Las Vegas buffet. What stood out the most were the crab legs that were prepared so the customers wouldn't have to doggedly dig for the meat inside. As well, the prime rib and the salmon were top notch. I am extremely picky about salmon and there's no other way to describe it as best as my roommate had: \"The salmon melts in my mouth. How is this possible?\" Other than that, the other selections of food did not really stand out. Some of my friends claimed that the desert were some of the best they have tasted. I'm not a huge fan of deserts, so I refrained from weighing on the matter. All in all, I would say for $30 it is not a bad choice to fill up on an empty stomach."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites ,  reasonably priced and a variation of dished. Tasty and lots to choose from.  The staff is friendly and are on top of things. Love it"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting The Cravings Buffet at the Mirage.  I normally stay at 1 of the many MGM resorts when I come to town and have eaten at most of them, but as I said, first time here.  I must say I was very happy with the buffet and the atmosphere.  Walking into the Casino prior to going into the buffet, the Hotel itself inside is very nice and beautifully decorated.  I know the Mirage is older, but it still holds up well.

The buffet is $29.99 for one person, Sunday-Thursday.  They offer a lot for that price and the quality is very good.  The bonus with this particular buffet, is it comes with unlimited Beer and Wine.  You could sit there for hours drinking during and after your meal if you decided to do so, what an amazing deal.

The Buffet has a carving station with Prime rib, Brisket and Turkey.  I got the prime rib and brisket, my vote is go for the brisket, so tender and flavorful, it was very, very good.  The also have a chef's kitchen for made to order items, seafood (my favorite) I loaded up on tons of crab legs as usual.  Latin, American, Asian, Sushi, Italian, salads and a desert bar.  It also comes with all you can drink self self non-alcoholic beverages.

After my 3rd trip I had to tap out and start writing this review with beer In hand.  There was not only a large selection of various types of food, everything tasted fresh and was delicious.  I would recommend checking this buffet out when you are in town, for the price, it is hard to find a better deal.

Pro tips - Park in the Treasure Island parking lot and walk over to the Mirage, the parking is free at Treasure Island, you have to pay at the Mirage unless you are an Mlife member and have at least gold status to get free parking.  

Speaking of Mlife, sign up if you have not already done so, it is the MGM resorts loyalty program.  You can get discounts on all kinds of things, shows, slot play, table play as well as comps for food, etc. worth it.  I would also suggest getting my vegas slots on your iPhone, it is Connected to your Mlife card and can get you many more rewards.  As I sit here, this Buffets was free, thanks to me using my rewards, many of which you don't even have to spend money to get from the app, which is awesome.  My rating is 5 stars here, price, quality, free alcohol and overall atmosphere is excellent.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE! Go somewhere else for Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner.
This is a review for their Dinner which was about $30/person.

1] Everything looked better than it tasted.
2] 70% of the food was cold/stale/salty.
3] if you come here for the seafood- do yourself a favor and dont:
- the crab legs were icy and super salty
- the sushi was pathetic, most of the sashimis were turning brown, nasty!
4] they attempted to label each of the stations according to ethnic
each station was a horrid disappointment, a sad attempt at gourmet fast food. 
5] Desserts: their pineapple cobbler was sure sugar. Their cookies where stale and hard, I think you can use it as a frisbe- chuck it at someone and you can give them a mild concussion. Oh, and their gelato was the worst! it was like warm soup ice cream. Yuck!
6] to top if off, the server is super rude. I think because they are too old to be working.

Overall, if you are \"craving\" a buffet, Don't go to Cravings! haha- go to Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan instead :)"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Las Vegas, I try to get to one buffet, and this one is it. On this trip, we arrived at around lunch time and included in the brunch was all you can drink beer, wine and mimosas. I must say that the all you can drink deal, made for a couple of amusing and disturbing outbursts from fans of the adult beverage, so this is not just your run of the mill humdrum establishment. You get entertainment as well!
Food quality is better than average. I like the fact that you can make your own salad. So many buffets have someone mixing all your junk in stainless bowl and spilling it on your plate. I like to have the control please. Did you notice that those salad bars got scarce after the 9/11 attacks and all the fear that we would all be poisoned at a salad bar? Well, that happened right?..uh, no?
Back to this buffet, the only thing missing is a really great desert section. Maybe real ice cream instead of the yogurt dispenser please? 
So my advice is to hit this place for your first meal at 12: 30, and sit and eat and drink for about 2 hours, and you are good to go for the rest of the day. The $37.50 will look like a bargain. BTW, if you are not staying at the Mirage, you can use your AAA card for a discount."}
{"text":"I've been to Cravings with different groups of friends and all of them have been pleasantly surprised with this buffet.  They offer a solid buffet with a fair selection for a decent dinner price of $25.

They have various stations offering different styles of food, although each station offers a somewhat limited amount of that particular style.  The king crab is good, the prime rib is delicious, and the desserts were excellent.

A very solid buffet and one of my favorites in Vegas."}
{"text":"Redeemed this buffet from the MyVegas game that I played on FB & I can easily say this place was really really good! Got there around 6ish on a Saturday night, the wait was about 15min. Prime rib was DELISH!!! Our server was so attentive and awesome, and service from the cashier to the cooks were phenomenal. I would definitely be willing to pay full price to come back!"}
{"text":"I'm a buffet nut and have been to enough buffets to know when an establishment is a ripoff. I wish somebody wrote about this. Maybe people have different standards or they don't know any better and actually consider this buffet good. This place is terrible, especially for $87 -- 2 adults, 1 child, Monday night, an hour wait. Poor selection. Food doesn't taste good at all. Lots of plates empty and not being refilled. Do not eat here!!"}
{"text":"This place is a really good deal! I was able to easily use my 2 for 1 coupon with no hassle! It costed less than 20 bucks for me and my husband to eat. There was a pretty okay selection of food. It was very tasty! There was also no wait at all to get into this buffet. I would return again for breakfast."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about the buffet, as it is $37 per person. However, we would have easily spent more than that at most other places, and I had a 2-for-1 comp since we stayed at the Mirage.

Vast array of choices, ranging from Latin, Chinese, Seafood, Italian, Salad, Dessert...the list goes on. The coolest part was unlimited beer and wine, but after two trips to the buffet...there's not much room for anything else!

The food was great and mostly fresh. Some items were a little dry, but really, it's a buffet. The dessert options were amazing, so save some room!

We went to the Bellagio buffet the night before, and I honestly thought Cravings was better."}
{"text":"Mediocre food at a moderate price. So many other better buffets on the strip.  Unless you're craving chicken and pizza."}
{"text":"Pretty solid buffet. The stations are labeled \"American\", \"sushi\", \"Italian\" etc. 

Things that are show stealers as far as buffets go are the crab legs *both hot AND cold* and the coke machines that have over 150 flavor combinations!  And not to mention AYCD (drink) Beer and Wine! 

We've been to this buffet a few times and it is slightly on the pricey side from $30.99+ but if you can eat at least a pound in crab legs (about a plate) you've covered your bill! Or if you go with a 'drinker' and can have a few glasses of red wine, you've also covered your bill. 

Sushi: there are usually five or so different options with at least 1 \"non fish\" (like 'veggie/mushroom roll or inari ) 

Overall worth it! :)

{"text":"When I got to Cravings I was kinda disappointed that there was no line. You know what that means? The food must not taste good. There was definitely a lot of variety but they were all lacking in quality. I was quite fond of the cocktail shrimp and ceviche, but you can't messed those up now can you? I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. If you really want to go to a buffet that taste good, I would recommend you head to Rio or the Bellagio. It's more expensive, but at least the quality of food is better. The staff are quicker to take away your plates and refilling yours drinks."}
{"text":"The Buffet at the Mirage known as CRAVINGS was excellent as I had dinner there prior to the LOVE show (I talk about below.)  EVERY PERSON that worked at that buffet THANKED us for our BUSINESS and not one other buffet went out of their way to smile and make sure we knew were appreciated.  This blew my mind!  Even the garbage taker outers all the way to the CHEF made sure they thanked us when we THANK THEM!!!  The food was great and I rank the Mirage Buffet top 3 Buffets in Vegas.  Aria being #2 and Wynn being #1

But I will stay at Mirage next time I go to Vegas...because also the lobby was breathtaking and it all was entering a beautiful \"story like\" atmosphere.  Very calming and aquariums and plants everywhere and very tastefully designed.  Thank you Mirage!

Las Vegas: The Beatles - Love - Cirque du Soleil

This was so beautiful I wish it went on forever!  Do make sure you go to the bathroom first because you totally are not going to want to leave to take a break at all!!

I HAD to go BUT realized it would be too high profile for me to walk out during the show.  The show makes use of EVERY part of the theater they can, including drawing the audience in and making them feel a \"part of it\" which is genius in and of itself.  

Without being a spoiler let me just say the Beatles wrote MORE than you probably even knew or recall!  A total treasure a must do while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'm just glad we came here with a buy one dinner, get one free offer because we were not impressed.  I thought the food choices were seriously lacking.  I've seen better at an Indian casino buffet.  The food was not hot.  By the time I sat down to eat, my food was pretty much cold.  Not many choices of sushi rolls and they appeared to be mislabeled.  I was really disappointed with dessert choices.  One nice thing is that beer and wine are included.  People seemed to really enjoy that since we saw several tables piled high with empty wine glasses.  Be aware that if you are a large party (i think 8 or more) they automatically tack on an 18% gratuity.  That would annoy me since you serve yourself both food and drinks.  The employees only cleared tables."}
{"text":"One of the better buffets I've tried.  The waitress was nice.  She told us stories about some regular customers.  I love hearing that kind of stuff.  
What most buffets don't do right is the fish and desserts.  The desserts were suprisingly good and the fish was alright (some were good, some you should skip).  In general, this place was yummy.  I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"2 stars because it's Vegas and you can definitely get better food than this. Buffets serve one purpose in Vegas, and that is awesome hangover food and sitting there for hours just basking in seconds and thirds and the general gluttony that is Sin City. 

The brunch price is pretty much the same as other places but the food quality is horrendous. Granted, there is a lot of variety, but I would rather have less of better food than a lot of crappy food. The dessert was like half tofu-based or something. The pho was borderline insulting. The best thing is probably the seafood bar where I loaded up on cocktail shrimp and crab legs, except the crab legs are stringy, tough and way too salty. Did they pick this up straight up from the ocean and dunked it back in sea water? Gross. 

Bottom line, this is not worth the line and someone really needs to teach the cooks to, well, cook. Ugh."}
{"text":"Buffet was great. Lots of variety of food starting at appetizers, to Asian, American, and Italian. 

This is the probably the only buffet where we had to get the drinks ourselves. Usually we have servers that do that. It was not a big deal though. Lots of drinks to choose from. They even had complimentary beer and wine.

Food was all great. Probably my only complaint was the sushi. Wasn't really that fresh. I liked how we could get a customizable pasta plate. You choose what type of noodles, vegetables and then your sauce and the chef cooks it right in front of you in minutes.

My favorite dessert was the crème bru le. Grabbed a few of those. 

It was an okay buffet. Probably only good for a one time experience"}
{"text":"Pretty impressive buffet. I'm sure it's not the best in Vegas, but with the Travelzoo deal this buffet was a steal and quality was good. I loved their smoked cheese. Would definitely come back even without the Travelzoo deal."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast buffet cheaper than most diners around. Line moved quickly. Lots of options to please everyone. The large juice glasses were a Godsend after a long night. Ice cold and no waiting for refills. My husband raved about the mini doughnuts :)
I can't comment on the lunch or dinner buffet which drastically increase in price but the breakfast is definitely one of the tastiest best deals in town."}
{"text":"Better than average buffet. We eat here every visit to Vegas. Well, maybe because we stay at the Mirage. Anyway, there maybe be better places out there, but we've had no problems with this place yet."}
{"text":"Just got here from California  and needed to eat every one was bragging bout this place being so good over priced food was ok host that sat us down was rude. For me and my husband was $64.00 food didn't have that much taste. Only good thing is all you can drink wine and beer bad it's only 4 type of wine and 2 beers."}
{"text":"03/10/13 BRUNCH

I purchased a TravelZoo coupon, entitling spouse and I to a Sat or Sun brunch for 2 w/ unlimited \"champagne\" (sparkling wine) for $26 (+$1.58 tax, paid at venue, and tip).

Why not, I thought. We've never been.

Well, there are worse buffets in Las Vegas Valley (I'm talking off-Strip), but this has to be the worst buffet on the Strip. But it's at least passable (I've been to some off-Strip that would curl your hair!), and there were some midway-to-high points in the adventure.

Cashier was efficient and accommodating. Table service was great, lovely lady, not very friendly but attentive. She poured us our \"champagne\", Wycliff (just short of being bad, but drinkable by itself, so I was happy. I ordered an orange juice, swear to god, it tasted like TANG! Childhood memory! EW!

So what did we try? A LOT, but nothing from Mexico or Italy. 

We got lots of stuff from the Asian section. 
- Edimames: already shelled, nice.
- Japanese potato salad: nice.
- A little sushi: only the octopus was good, the others were grocery store style.
- Chinese buns: spouse liked them, pork & seafood, I only had the seafood, too doughy.
- Potstickers: good. Spouse liked these quite a bit, actually.

Then on to the seafood section.
- Large shrimps: good. But the cocktail sauce was obviously from a jar. Took a little drawn butter instead back to the table, that was nice.
- Bay shrimps, various preparations: avoid.
- Ceviches: avoid.
- Crab legs: the thinnest, chewiest, worst crab legs I've ever encountered. I took only one, ate half, yuck. Never again.

Spouse had lots more. What was it? Oh, biscuits/gravy (I tasted, so-so), some kind of potatoes gratin, what else? He was OK with all of it. Me, I had read the ups and downs of the prime rib. \"Only get it rare\", some have posted here. Well, spouse came back with a small non-rare, and it was so-so, he only ate half. I went, got bloody rare, huge piece, ate nearly the entire thing, I was very happy! Not the greatest prime rib, of course, but still, it was really good, at the end of the savory foods.

If there were ever a next time, I think I'd stick to the Asian section, try some of those egg-drop soups, etc.

Desserts? Sad. \"Mirage bread pudding\" was a mishmash of runny bottom of pan with hard-ass top of portion. Not good. The creme brulee was so-so. The only recommended ones we'd say would be the raspberry bar (very fruity, probably jam, but who cares!) and the marshmallows covered in dark chocolate (which were light after a huge meal like ours). 

To sum up. I would never go there and pay full price. I'd rather spend that money at the new Bacchanal @ Caesars, Wicked Spoon @ Cosmo, Bellagio, ARIA, etc. BUT if you get comp'd or get a great coupon deal, like that TravelZoo, I'd go and make the best of it."}
{"text":"Buffet is okay! Good variety of good! Not the best but pretty good for the price :) I had the prime rib, sushi, crab legs, fried rice (which was a little dry) the green beans, and some other stuff... It was pretty good considering I was a little tipsy :)"}
{"text":"I really liked this place! Bottomless beer and wine?  once you've had enough of that you don't care so much about the food 

Wee jokes.

I liked the selection here, the staff were the friendliest of all 3 buffets I tried and I got good suggestions from her.  Curry was gloopy and crappy but otherwise I liked everything I had.  

Top tip? Go see the chef and have him throw you together something.  My girlfriend got a custom pasta dish and let him be creative - it was DELISH!! 

Loved it here for sure :)"}
{"text":"Food here is mediocre.   Don't waste your money at this buffet.  Only reason we went here is because the hotel comp us.  Every thing barely made par.  Food was just food here.  Only thing I remotely enjoyed was the .... I can't even remember... sad.

Oh gelato was good! Two stars for that!!"}
{"text":"Over 30 dollars per person! You would think now that the servers don't get your beverages they would drop the price.  I seen this old couple struggling with their drink and spilled about half of it, before they got to their table. Pretty soon they are going to give you an apron and have you pick up your own plates. Even Station Casinos gets your drinks. Plus the quality of the food is going down. Plenty of better buffets out there."}
{"text":"Parties of 8 or more are automatically charged a 20% tip. If this were a typical table-service restaurant, I'd completely understand, and probably tip a little more. But, this is a BUFFET! You are expected to serve yourself, including beverages. Our server took away the dirty dishes & brought me a crab leg cracker. That was it. I'm sure she works hard but I resent being mandated on how much to tip. So our group of 10 split into two separate tables, in two different servers' areas, to avoid the required tip. Of course, we left a tip anyway.

That irritation aside, the buffet was quite good. Offering everything from sushi to stir fry to tacos, the buffet meal also includes draft beer & house wines (again, self-serve). For about $30, this is a great value in Vegas! The Dungeness Crab Legs were my favorite, but I also loved the tender medium-rare Prime Rib. The Macaroni & Cheese was so cheesy & creamy, and the Mashed Potatoes were outstanding. My friends raved about the Turkey and BBQ Ribs as well. Everything I tried was delicious and definitely exceeded my *buffet expectations*."}
{"text":"The three stars is mainly for the prime rib.

Alright when in Vegas, you've got to hit a buffet, it's just a must. I'm not sure how we decided on mirage, but I've never been here so why not. The prime rib was definitely something to rave about, super tender and juice not like most buffets, but the second round it was dry..Whyyyy. Consistency people! Consistency is key. 

Overall, it was extremely mediocre. Like the brink of EHHHHH and mediocre. Like it barely reached the standard of OK. Well, that's a $35 dollar buffet for you when there are $40-50 ones and even $80-90 ones during holiday season like bacchanal. There wasn't a lot of options or variety. Desserts are usually something I'm attracted to at buffets, but definitely not here. don't call your froyo soft serve ice cream gelato...because it's not. Such false advertisement. It's unlimited beer and wine which is nice, but it sucks that allllll drinks are self serve and we were seated on the opposite side...it was so far :( yeah we're lazy but when in Vegas, you just expect quality places with quality service! That's not too ridiculous right?"}
{"text":"We went for Brunch. The food was great as always. This was our 2nd time here. Will certainly go again. The Wines were good & the bartender was very friendly & didn't look offended if we requested for another glass of wine, like the last time we were here in March.
We enjoyed it here. Thank You."}
{"text":"I used to like Cravings Buffet a lot more than I do now.  I went back a couple weeks ago before we saw the Beatles Love again.  I felt a little guilty cutting in front of the massive line with my Mlife card.  I can't figure out why there were so many people there, unless you are going to use the unlimited Beer and Wine I don't see what the attraction is for people any more.  It was really average to bad this time around.  The last time we went there for Lunch they had a Salad Station, with someone making Salads and they were really, really great!  Now the Salad Station is just a lame Salad Bar.  The Crab Legs this time were also tiny and pathetic and so picked over when I was there for dinner.  They were also really overcooked so they were very difficult to get out of the shell. 
 The Sushi tasted old and I couldn't even eat it.  I did like the Prime Rib and they were serving some BBQ Ribs which saved the day for me.  The desserts looked better than they tasted.  I have to say the service was fantastic, our server kept clearing plates and asking us if he could get us anything.  They really need to renovate this buffet like Excalibur recently did.  Shut it down for a while and redo everything.  I do like the drink machines, it is nice not having to wait around for a refill.  I would go there if you have a comp, but that is about it.  I think people would probably rate the buffet far worse if they weren't so happy about being able to drink for free for a couple of hours.  But for a foodie like me it is pretty bad just based on the food!!!"}
{"text":"They're awesome! I've had the pleasure speaking with a couple of Managers here and they were very accommodating. 
My family had a great time for my grandfather's 80th birthday. 
Food was exactly what we expected from the great reviews as well as the photos shown. 
Plus on all ends of this restaurant.

Thank you Cravings!"}
{"text":"Went there for my first American thanksgiving with my buddies. The food there was alright. They had a great selection of food (including crab legs and oysters) but nothing felt super delicious. The all you can drink beer and wine was good though, it felt like an open bsr except our choices were limited down to 2 type of beers and 3 different wines. I would say though their dessert section was sweet. I wide selection of desserts such as cakes, pies, pastries and gelato. The dessert section itself got me excited. The price was around 37 a person, which was cheaper than the other buffet prices I have seen ($50+)."}
{"text":"There was a large variety of food but the quality wasn't too great. But it was also one of the cheaper buffets (It was 37 per person including tips and tax) and it came with all you can drink alcohol, but obviously not the best quality of alcohol either. I'd have to say the chinese food wasn't that great and if you come you should try the italian, american, or seafood.

I enjoyed the salmon a lot because it wasn't overcooked and had just enough seasoning to make it interesting. The dessert wasn't that great either because the pies were still frozen. The fried rice was all soggy which wasn't too enjoyable and the ham was too salty. Overall, there was a lot of little things off with the food and it wasn't the best quality and I've seen places with more variety. I guess the only benefit is that this restaurant is cheap.

The line is also really long to get into the restaurant so we had to wait an hour and a half and the food was alright."}
{"text":"Mirage buffet.  
We ate here on a Tuesday on a 2 for 1 coupon, $32.  Got the coupon from playing an iPhone game, myVEGAS.   As far as buffets go, this is my favorite.  Food is varied and has more of the assortment I like (Texan, more beef less Asian,fish crapola).  Food was also very good.  You get drinks with your meal...like beer, wine.

We showed up again for breakfast on a Saturday.  2 for 1 coupon again but on the weekends, they serve brunch.  $39 with the coupon.  Breakfast was good. Hard to go for crab legs at 9 in the morning though.  Brunch is basically all the foods they serve during the day plus breakfast and a higher price.

We'll eat here again but not on a weekend."}
{"text":"Hate to pile on but the food here is very good quality everything was hot! If you want a good lunch or brunch for 20 bucks and free drinks this will work for you."}
{"text":"Very mediocre. Not worth the $ unless you like cheap wine!   The breakfast buffet is processed food from the freezer and the oatmeal is so watery my kids wouldn't eat it!  Disappointing"}
{"text":"This Buffet Participates with Tix4Tonight (30%) and AAA (20%) discounts.

The Weekend Brunch seems to include basic Beer, Bloody Marry's, and Mimosas.

The food quality is just OK. The sushi tasted like it came from Vons (Costco sushi is better). Panda Express does better at their beef broccoli. The pizza looks like it is cooked in a fancy way, but they must have skimped on the ingredients because it does not taste anything special. They did not have seafood crackers for the crab claws. I had to go to the bar to get mimosa refills because the waiting staff was very slow at refills.

I was also a little disappointed that there was no Crème brûlée at the dessert station; however, I must say I did love their chocolate bread pudding. 

Overall the food and service was just OK. Next time I am in Vegas, I will try a different buffet."}
{"text":"I loved the tossed salad. The reason I ate here was because they had sushi...big mistake, it wasn't good at all...but I found other things that I loved. $19.99 lunch buffet and it includes your soda."}
{"text":"For some reason, my mother swears by this buffet. She would put her life on the line here. I know. 

Living up to mom's wishes, I came here for brunch. I came here 3 years ago but seriously, who can remember what they've ate 3 years ago?

I'm really not a fan of the food here. Well...except for the eggs benedict (heaven!) and the egg personalization. The dude behind the eggs is awesome. 
Not a lot of options for dessert, even if you've found something that looks good, it might be \"sugar-free\". Damn you low carb eaters.

Overall, a nice buffet, but just not for me because I feel like there's not a lot of good options. Well, I'm looking back at my old review...still very attentive and nice staff though, I'll give you that."}
{"text":"Vegas buffets are always sort of hit-and-miss for me. Either they offer cheap grub that's usually mass produced and swimming in mystery juice, or it's something akin to a fine dining experience that tantalizes the taste buds and leaves you wanting more even though you're already busting at the seams. Cravings is more of the latter.

First and foremost, yes, it is a bit pricey, but two things that help offset that. First, the quality of the food that you're getting is pretty gosh darn good. Second, you need to use myVegas rewards, if you have them. Getting a two-for-one deal or even a free meal altogether makes it so much more worth it. 

On to the food. Let's just say that nothing here disappointed me. They had plenty of hit soups available that were absolutely wonderful. Their selection of Asian cuisine was unusually good, and what I'd refer to as \"Americana\" was pretty spot on, too. What I like about buffets like Cravings is that the food comes out in smaller batches compared to other places. This means that the food is fresh and the quality tends to sit a little higher across the board.

Oh, and who can say \"no\" to unlimited booze? Yes, that's right. Included with dinner is free beer and wine. You can always pay for something a little more fancy, if you want, but why would you? Enjoy what you are being offered!"}
{"text":"food was pretty mediocre. bonus points for free beer and wine & the fancy Coke machines. misleading sign for gelato over the froyo station. would rather pony up the extra dough for a better quality buffet next time."}
{"text":"I've had way better buffets in Vegas, and this was definitely not one I'd go back to. Let's start with the positives: the buffet was clean, circling around the tables in the eating area, and separated into a large variety of different cuisines. The prime rib and pastas were mediocre, and the gelato was yummy. That was about as far as the positives went. The bread (or is it?) was hard and crumbled into flakes when I took a bite. The sushi (or their attempt at one) was hard, so it was futile to even use a fork to pick it up. Our server was inattentive and seemed annoyed when we had to ask for drink refills. Now I know the lines outside better buffets are there for a reason; there was no line at Cravings and the tables were mostly empty on the Friday evening we went."}
{"text":"I was scared of this place based on some of the reviews I read. We went on a Sunday with one comped lunch, paid for the other. Expectations were low, which I've now convinced myself is the way to go into a buffet. Then you either get what you were expecting or in the case of Cravings, you get more than expected. The day we went in, we didn't know brunch was a special thing. We received not only the option of mimosas, but a wide selection  of beer and wine with our meal at no extra charge. We stuck with mimosas as that just seemed the perfect thing after a evening out on the town the previous night. The pastries were good, better than you get at any free breakfast with hotel stay (comparing it to other hotels we stay at when traveling, not in Vegas). The croissants were cold but were flaky and not overly buttery. Almost the best I've had in the U.S. Bacon was warm and crispy, not overly greasy like typical buffet bacon. We sampled the Asian, Mexican, and Salad areas of the buffet. We liked everything we tried. I did wish the Mexican station had tamales, but that's only because I was craving them. I'm a salad whore and felt their more upscale way of making/serving their salad (they make it for you but you get to pick what goes in it) was a bit snobbish. It's served in these little bowls. Probably good for the average person. When I want a salad, I want a huge plate of salad! Delicious house dressing, btw. While we've visited almost all of the buffets on the strip, I put this one at about #4 behind the Wynn, Bellagio, and Rio (ok, a little off strip but I feel it still counts). We do look forward to visiting again in the future."}
{"text":"We make several trips to Vegas a year since it's an easy drive from SoCal.  We try various buffet's and restaurants every time we visit, but sometimes, the familiar is nice.  

I can honestly say, Cravings Buffet is the most consistent of all of them, and that says something.  We've gone enough times we recognize some of the same hostesses and servers.  Not sure if they recognize us, but we're always treated as if they do.  

The food hasn't changed much over the years, and that's OK.  You know what to expect, and there are times that's nice.  Breakfast is our favorite time to visit, especially right before lunch as you get the best of both. 

Yes, the buffet is buffet food, that means it can be sitting there a while, however the omelet station is made to order.   While a little thing, I like the cheese and cracker station.  That's almost like desert to me, although the deserts are pretty good as well.  

We've been going now for over 10 years, and it's always nice to return to Cravings as we know what to expect and they haven't failed to deliver yet.  (Still wish they'd return to gelato though instead of soft serve - just saying in case someone is taking notes.)"}
{"text":"We stay at The Mirage quite frequently so we always end up eating here a lot. It's a good buffet.  The Mimosa Brunch is always fun. The downside is the buffet and wall dividers up and there isn't much room between them and the buffet stations. Once you add people waiting in line at those stations, it can make for a tight squeeze."}
{"text":"This is a decent buffet. About $25 for weekday lunch and it includes house wine and beer.  There was s shrimp and ceviche and guacamole and prime rib and sushi.

The food is ok, service was fine, and the restaurant is clean. The meat was overcooked and the selection is limited.  Compared to the Paris' buffet, same price not Inc beer/wine, this pales in comparison.  

But I was able to have a low carb meal there: shrimp, chicken, turkey, smoked salmon, steamed veggies, and salad.  A bit more than I would pay - I wish they would offer a no booze choice as I hate beer and don't drink cheap wine."}
{"text":"It went downhill. 
It was breakfast but all the free alcohol can't make this better. They cut down on the service and made it all self serve ( drinks).

Our waitress came back with some paper napkins saying something about  how she found them and was sharing the loot with us. Aren't you supposed to know where the napkins are kept?"}
{"text":"Prime rib was good, but otherwise disappointed in the overall selection of foods considering the advertisements for this place. Staff didn't know full protocol as the sign stating to go containers were $16 also stated to go beverages were $3.50. When I inquired about a to go beverage I was told it couldn't be done. Too tired to argue.  Management should change sign or re-educate staff."}
{"text":"Food was very good and rate 5. But charging $30 a person and nobody even gets you a drink. Everything is self serve and on top of that, they pre charge gratuity. That's why I rate a 1."}
{"text":"Came here with a huge party because we had food credits and room keys. Unlimited beer and wine really makes this worth it. But they also have the ultimate sode machine this is a gamecharger because this may have been 3 stars rating. The soda machine reminds me of when I was a kid with a big gulp so entertained! Buffet had a good selection but nothing crazy stuck out. Crab legs, prime rib, gelato and macaroons I had alot of but nothing else was impressive. Better than most buffets on the strip because of the unlimited drinks. I recommend trying it for yourself"}
{"text":"I got a free lunch buffet at Cravings thanks to playing Facebook slots on MyVegas.com. Out of the Vegas buffets I've had the pleasure of gorging out at, this was the least quality out of them all. 
They had a good selection of foods, sorted by the type. Asian, American, Italian, fish, etc. The food seemed to be fresh, but they had obviously cut some corners on the food. The eggs Benedict was served on a roll, not the typical kind I'm used to. The shrimp was, well shrimpy. There was a long line to wait for the carving station. When I got the roast beef back to the table, it was rather fatty- a low quality of beef. 
The desserts seemed to be leaning heavily towards the sugar free side, which blows my mind. If you're going to a Vegas buffet, I'm sure you're not terribly concerned about your waist line. 
There was a lady that came by and picked up the used plates, but there was no other service available. You had to get your own drinks like some sort of shlub. 
I was pleased to see that there were about four different types of sushi, which seemed fresh. 
But they were lacking many things that I have come to expect on a Vegas buffet. They had no crab legs. The pizza was a shade better than Little Caesar's Pizza. 
Yes, the food was plentiful, but not the high grade that I have come to expect from the Mirage on everything else.
The drinks were impressive. Free beer. But they only have Anheiser Busch products. Boo. They had one of those magical Coca-Cola machines where you can get over a hundred varieties of soda.  
I was disappointed in the quality of food, but I didn't get food poisoning or anything. It was OK, but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"We ate here last Friday. There were 6 of us. The Sushi was dry, the short ribs we're tough and you couldn't even cut them with a knife (they should fall off the bone),  the prime rib had no flavor even when you put it in the aju sauce, and the salad bar didn't have any options. The only good food was pizza and made to order pasta. Way too expensive for a bad dinner at such a nice hotel. Won't be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Gone downhill recently. No 'fish' at the fishmonger - only cheap crab. Pasta chef never knew what basic dishes were and the selection all round was on the lower end of the scale. 
I guess the Mirage hotel is trying to appeal to the budget customer and sets product choice to match."}
{"text":"Nice selection and friendly staff, but that is the only positive.  We went around 3:00 for a late lunch and we both said the same thing - everything was cold and dry.  I really had a hard time finding anything that was enjoyable to eat, which is bad with the number of items they had available"}
{"text":"Just ok.  Would probably recommend it more for breakfast or lunch.  If you are staying there, get a free one, or have a group with diverse tastes, it's might fit the bill.  It had got a bit of everything, and nothing is awful.  But nothing is amazing either.  Hence the 3-stars.  If you are looking for a really good buffet though, there are much better ones out there.  (Bellagio, Aria, Wicked Spoon @ Cosmo, Wynn.)"}
{"text":"One word - horrible!!!!  

But I should start on a positive. The salad was neat. They make it for you. But have weird asst of fixings and way too much salad dressing. They did have a grilled cauliflower that was yummy. And the pizza was great but not worth $30. Nathan said the prime rib and ribs were yummy and went back for seconds. Of course his last meal was chicken nuggets at noon at the airport. 

Honestly there was no food here that I liked. The soups are weird colors and look canned and sitting way too long. The sushi was horrible. Dried out. Don't make so much if folks aren't eating it. The pot stickers were greasy. The vegetable spring roll was mostly roll with a few slivers of cabbage and on of carrot.  The potato augratin which is usually hard to pass up couldn't be cut up with a fork.  Overall YUCK!!!

Save your money."}
{"text":"The Food is delicious, fresh and very well prepared. Our server kept our table clear and the mimosas coming. My husband really enjoyed the crab... And well I was in heaven with all the breakfast/brunch items. Worth it."}
{"text":"Terrible. Used to be the diamond in the rough every year up until this yearly trip. 

They reduced the cost of dinner to 28 dollars but the food selection is now half of what it used to be

Also, at the start of dinner at around 530pm one would expect fresh food, but most of it had the 4 hour under a dry heat lamp look to it.

Asked our server why the food looked stale and he said it shouldn't.. Ill pass it along to the manager *rollseyes*

Lastly food quality dramatically dropped. Save your money and goto McDonald's instead for better food quality"}
{"text":"What happened to the Mirage Buffet that I remember from years ago?  We had dinner at Cravings because we were watching a show at the Mirage during our stay in Vegas.  There was no wait for the dinner buffet priced at $29 per person and we were shown to our table.  

The buffet has been remodeled since my last visit and it isn't good.  I felt like I was dining in a square shaped school cafeteria and the servers also looked liked they worked in a school cafeteria.....all they were missing was a hair net, lol.  

The buffet stations are located all along the four walls of the restaurant and the seating area was in the middle.  No ambiance at all...disappointing.  Our server, Mildred explained all of the buffet stations....seafood, Italian, American, Asian, Salad, and Dessert stations.   

My dinner buffet consisted of the following:
*  Cold Cracked Crab Legs - They were frozen and were defrosting in the buffet container.  
*  Shrimp Cocktail -  Nothing Special
*  Steamed Mussels - Again, nothing special
*  Sauteed Fish Fillet - Salty
*  Sauteed Broccolini - Fresh and delish!
*  Salad - Made to order and tasty.  There were also a couple of types of pre-made salads which were fresh.
*  Roast Beef - Dry and overcooked.
*  Desserts - Cafeteria looking desserts....enuff said.

My dinner buffet at Cravings was disappointing.  I only enjoyed my salad and some of the vege entrees for $29....plus, the setting was like a mess hall.  I wouldn't return for dinner again.  2 Stars."}
{"text":"came with no expectations (had never been)...arrived 4pm last Friday...hardly anyone there (yet the casino was PACKED)...so was a little concerned.  BUT excellent buffet...and HUGE.  literally, so much selection that I was full having only tasted a portion of their offerings.  being a vegetarian, was very pleased that it seemed 1/2 of their stuff was veggie.  very strange/creative selections...with overall good flavors.  potatoes were great (mashed and cut)!  the only negative was the salad bar, which you cannot serve yourself...so I felt obliged to tip.  why can't you get your own salads?  but the salad quality and toppings were good.  pizza was BLAH...oh well, and kinda cold.  overall -- very good deal for just under $30 a pop per person.  give it a go!"}
{"text":"This buffet was $25 for lunch and we needed to stuff our faces before going to EDC. The food options here are mediocre and there aren't many good ones. Nonetheless, there are some good selections here if you look hard enough.

I knew I wouldn't have eggs for a week and got them to make an omelette with everything with guacamole(from the Mexican table). The prime rib and the spiced rapini were great. Wine and beer are included. I usually drink white wine and they had moscato and chardonnay. I opted for the latter option. My drinks were coffee and grapefruit juice. They have a soft drink machine as well for whatever soft drink you want. 

The clam chowder, miso soup and smoked salmon weren't bad. The sushi selection was awful. 

Unfortunately, there aren't many good dessert options and no ice cream either. Only frozen yogurt. 

You can tell that I didn't try everything because like I said, there aren't many amazing options but $25 for AYCE isn't bad. However, I probably wouldn't come back because I chose this buffet due to it being close by. Atmosphere was plain."}
{"text":"If you're planning on paying for a buffet on the Strip, allow me to convince you otherwise, because it is definitely not worth it. However, if you find yourself with some complementary buffet vouchers, let the Wycliff flow! Most of the food here is standard buffet, which is to say, bad, but there are some palatable items to be had if you look carefully enough. I went with the gyros, available near the salad bar. Also acceptable-looking were the salads themselves. For dessert, I hunkered down for some frozen instant pudding (or gelato, as they call it around these parts), which tasted good enough. As an aside, I noticed a lot of people putting their faith in the raw bar here, and I haven't heard news of a salmonella outbreak, so that's something. Sparkling wine is complementary, so drink up!"}
{"text":"This place is awful... Let me reiterate... AWFUL. So maybe I got spoiled by going to the buffet at the Wynn, but really I don't know why anyone would want to eat here.  The food is completely bland and the service is HORRIBLE.  The server took 20 minutes before she even came over to say hello and ask us for our drinks.  There was no plate pick up throughout the WHOLE meal and the food was bland bland bland! 

Icky."}
{"text":"Decent buffet and ok spread. Really liked that they had Pho. A big plus there. Other than that is a slightly better than average Vegas Buffet."}
{"text":"A very good, if not superb, but not yet exceptional lunch buffet here in Vegas. After experiencing the well reviewed Bellagio lunch buffet we decided to  try the Mirage Crave for lunch. The ambience is good although not as \"luxurious\" or upscale as the bellagio. However that seems to be the only thing the bellagio has on the Mirage buffet. 1. Food selection is better. 2. The food quality is better. 3. Dessert has a wider selection and tastes better overall. 4. The price is better, especially if you buy the discount coupon for $2   at Tix4Tonight which drops the price from $24 to $18 per person, a much better deal than the Bellagio buffet. Finally, servers are also very gregarious, more so than most places. I think you'll like it."}
{"text":"Not bad. It's your average buffet. We came after the breakfast rush but before the lunch rush (around 11:15am.) Some of the dishes you could tell had been sitting out for awhile (the corn bread was so hard it crumbled when I tried breaking it, one of the cookies was also completely hard you couldn't even bite into it.) The freestyle coke machine was cool and everything was self served so it was nice to just be able to get my own things. They also have free drinks at the bar. Overall the food was okay."}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars for the price paid.
Service: 1 star.

Been there with a French friend visiting the US because we had a 50% (or 30%?) off coupon which would make the whole day buffet on a Saturday at 25$ (you can get 11$ weekday brunch with that coupon from Tix4tonight).
Not a bad deal. Especially it includes free flow of wines and beers.

First: don't go there unless you have a discount coupon. I don't think the buffet is worth over 20$ (unless you drink a lot of alcohol).
The food is OK, very standard, slightly on the cheap side.
Suchi bar? lot of rice, nothing fine nor gourmet, small selection.
Cheese? industrial, small selection.
Meat? quite oily. American buffet? on the heavy side.
crab legs? yes unlimited snow crab legs. Frozen though and not cooked very well (very salty, watery).
Dessert buffet seemed great. Too bad I don't eat sweet.

I think it's a 3 stars food-wise, for 20ish $.

OK now why 2 stars? Service.
your dirty plates can sit on your tables for 20 minutes. piling up. Our waitress was making a pretty long face and worst of all: she dropped sauce and meat from our plates twice (and a lot, not just few drops), while removing them form the table. Sauce landed twice on your bags that were on the chairs next to us. Not a sorry, not offering to clean, she probably even didn't notice.

You can go there if you wanna eat whole day and don't mind the service."}
{"text":"At Cravings, it was all about the quantity and not the quality. There were many different choices, from Italian to Mexican to Japanese to Chinese.  Some were edible and some were not. The only thing I really liked was the grilled asparagus. The dessert bar was a disaster which reminded me of a slightly better version of the Hometown Buffet. 

One would expect a better buffet at the Mirage. What the hell happened? The price is reasonable though at about $20.  If you are just going to 1 buffet, this should not be the one."}
{"text":"We ate hear on our first night in Vegas after walking around the strip. From the points we received from our My Vegas Slots app, we were able to get 2 buy one get 1 free dinner buffets. The buffet prices is a little over $30 but for all five of us we were able to get them for under $100. 

There was a large selection but I am sure it is not the best Vegas has to offer. They have Asian cuisine, a not very impressive sushi bar, Italian, carvery, barbecue, ETC. I had the prime rib which was really good and tender. Beyond that my other favorites were the huge split crab legs and giant shrimp cocktail! I enjoyed everything I ate here and would recommend it! This was a good first meal in Las Vegas but I will definately be checking out different buffets because there are so many others!"}
{"text":"Dinnertime:  This place has a vast quantity of foods ( asian, latin, italian, american) BUT quantity doesn't make up for quality.  I felt the best they had to offer when we went for the Sunday night dinner was the Lamb Osso Buco,  and flank steak (ONLY if medium, otherwise it'd be too dry).  The other things were a little... off.

The Lamb osso Buco was soft enough that it would just fall off the bone, and it had a good flavor to it- not really gamey.  This went along well with the sauteed buttered wild mushrooms in the italian section of the buffet.

The Flank steak goes well with the port demi (which is alongside the porkloin wrapped in bacon, which didn't taste all that great...)  

There was also the Ceviche, which was waaaayy too sour, and not enough spice.  The Cioppino was really salty and super mini-shrimped.  They also had dim sum (which was bland) and sushi (which had meat which didn't look so tasty so I didn't try it).  I don't remember much of the other things because they didn't taste good.

Hands down the best thing from this buffet was the dessert!  Their mini pecan pies and mini lemon meringue were really good.  If after you eat the entrees you feel a little sick, eat the lemon meringue as the tart flavor might help with the nauseating feeling coming from your stomach..  The puddings were scary:  The chocolate one was actually GRAINY!!  And the Pistachio one tasted interesting...."}
{"text":"The food here is okay. We like it, especially the dessert. They have a great variety of dessert, with some chocolate-covered marshmallow pops.

HOWEVER, my girlfriend and I care about customer service a lot. I've been in the retail industry for 10+ years, and my girlfriend's majoring in hospitality. Our server...well, he might be a great server to some other tables. But to us, he's certainly one of the worst! His name is Luis. You're lucky if you're a Caucasian. If you're not, you're out of luck. (We're Asians by the way) We saw him asking other tables if they were doing okay, and kept giving refills without them asking, and with a smile on his face. What about us? We were NEVER asked how we were doing. We NEVER got refills without asking. We waited for a while on purpose, wanting to see if he'd give us refills. NOOOO... He'd be holding a bottle of champagne, walking by, without looking at us at all. Finally I couldn't hold it anymore. I said \"excuse me\" out loud, and he gave us refills. But he had this really bad I-don't-wanna-serve-you look on his face. My girlfriend asked for some coffee. He didn't respond to that at all!!!! He did bring it out, but he never said thank you or you're welcome to us! NEVER!

Servers earn most of their money from tips. How can you give such poor service?! Well, we got some changes when we were coming in...there goes your tips, Luis!"}
{"text":"Today we enter another exciting episode of Anthony vs. the Buffet. As always, I win if I emerge with a full belly and happy about the things I put in it. The buffet wins if it makes me hate myself.

Round One:
I fill my first plate with a variety of sushi and pour myself a bowl of miso soup if for no other reason than the sushi station is adjacent to the bar (bottomless beer and wine for the win!). I'm pleasantly surprised by the quality of the rolls and the miso goes down smoothly. I mean, is it even possible to screw up miso soup? In any case, I'm very happy with my first plate and ready for further punishment. Round one goes to me.

Round Two:
A thought strikes me as I chug my third glass of wine. It's only 11am. I should get some breakfast food. I mosey on down to the omelette station and have the chef whip me up one with everything. I supplement it with way too much bacon and sit down to enjoy. Unfortunately I can't get more than halfway through it. The eggs are heavy and the toppings taste like they've been sitting out for awhile. Well, they have, so I don't know what I was expecting. I shove aside the plate. Round two goes to the buffet.

Round Three:
I have to bounce back from my slip up last round. I make my way to the Asian station for Gyoza and War Won Ton Soup hoping to repeat the success of the sushi. Little do I know the soup has been lying in wait like a sleeper cell, ready to pounce on my tastebuds in a flavor explosion. It is far and away the best thing the buffet has to offer. I sneak another bowl as a victory lap. I win round three.

Round Four:
I'm starting to feel the pressure of fullness creeping in, so I decide to take it easy this round. I slide to the salad bar for something light, grabbing a bowl and stuffing it with a generous scoop of every topping. After drizzling it with a glob of dressing, I shove this Frankenstein's monster of a salad into my face. Surprisingly it makes me super full. But it's lettuce, right? Oh well. I call this round a draw.

Round Five:
In a surprising lack of judgment I decide to finish with something very stupid. I stroll over to the carving station. \"Prime rib please.\" They slap a huge slab of dead cow on my plate and I scoop a mountain of mashed potatoes on the side with green beans. I don't know why I thought this would go well. I graze my way through the salty side of beef and do my best to put the potatoes away, but it's a losing battle at this point. Stomach at the edge of bursting, I shove aside the plate and raise my white flag. You win this one, buffet.

The verdict:
Who even cares? It's $30 for all-you-can-eat (and drink of you only want beer or wine). The options aren't that great, but if you're like me and get blasted on wine first, you won't notice. 3 stars."}
{"text":"Just visited the Cravings buffet on a Saturday. The build your own pasta bar and the unlimited beer and wine however was the show-stopper at this place. The pasta was very very good. Other than that, I honestly am not a huge buffet person. Something with quality drops off when food is sold in limit-less quantities. My friend had an insatiable craving for crab, so that's what brought us to a buffet at all. She thoroughly enjoyed it, but that was pretty much all she ate. I had a few of the other offerings like the Mexican food and the Asian food, and they were both just ok. The baked deserts including cookies were just average, and all 3 of us in my party agreed to that. What I did like was the gelato and sorbet machine. At least that made my walk to the dessert area worthy.

Oh yes, forgot to mention, the seating staff was excellent and very professional! 

Yelp Yourself!"}
{"text":"Lackluster. That describes the food. It makes up for it in quantity but there isn't any quality. They have beer and wine, and its just okay. The seafood section does have oysters but I'm worried about them getting me sick now. It has so many options but everything was flat. 

The good: there are so many options and a soup at every station. 
Bought my 30% discount from tickets4less.
They have a pasta chef station that prepares your food.
The tortellini is superb.
They have a nice cheese and smorgsboard of ingredients for a picnic. 

The bad:
Tri-bean salad: no flavour tasted like mush.
Seafood buns: the dough sticks to the tongs, mushy and the meat was tough. 
Sushi: some of the worst delivery and serving spoons-tongs are a nuisance to use it was obvious by all the dropped sushi.
Cranberry juice: was watered down by some filter malfunction or the syrup was just low. 
Clam chowder was not marked with bacon or ham. Misleading for vegetarians. 
The okra was boiled to death and had no flavour. 
They do not have forks at the dessert bar. 
There are not enough tongs for the desserts so cross contamination of chocolate and nuts could occur.
Wipes after eating crab are not provided. 
The chairs and tables are hideous and uncomfortable. 

The ugly:
I'm confused how they justify charging a gratuity tax when they do not serve you. You get your own drinks and spoons. Other than their cellphone flag down system to seat you, there just isn't a reason. If you bring a big group just split up."}
{"text":"i held my lunch meal here for thirty of my wedding guest on june 22nd 2012 the service was really good i give it 5 stars the ppl that got our sodas were quick and helpful to any of our question regarding where certain foods were. There was a large selection and the food was really good. It was a little pricey but it was my wedding day."}
{"text":"Overall mediocre experience, but one of the convenient restaurants to go to  if you're going to watch a show at the Mirage. Staff are nice. Only a few select items taste okay-  like the Chef's  Kitchen area (pasta made by order), cocktail shrimp, chicken & broccoli  rice noodle stir-fry, salad bar, and cookies.
 
Plus- unlimited wine and beer. 

Original price: $32.99(plus tax)/person. With purchase of  $2.00 Ticket Master coupon, price was $23.99 at the door."}
{"text":"Pretty good buffet but I expected more selections. The stuff are great making sure everything is good."}
{"text":"Still a 3 Star buffet from the last time I went here.  

Crab Legs. Check.

Crab Claws, Check.

Refilling them on a timely basis.  Not really.  I did 2 rounds after eating other foods, no refills on the crab legs.    They are most likely doing this on purpose. For a crab eater, this is shameful.

Lemons were not refilled on a timely basis.   They probably doing this on purpose. 

Fountain drinks are self serve.  I like that. 

Otherwise, I still dislike this layout of this buffet.  

Server who collected our plates was awesome.

Lots of people \"people watching\".  Shouldn't you be eating instead of watching me eat??? 

Dessert Selection was still not impressive as Aria."}
{"text":"We were actually very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this buffet.  All the stations were clean and well stocked, and none of the food had a \"cheap\" taste or feel to it.  We actually ended up eating here twice on the same trip, once for dinner and once for lunch.

Even better, I didn't want to get my drink on before dinner and kill my buzz, yet I was afraid I might get food coma and not want to party later.  Imagine the smile on my face when I found out unlimited wine and beer was included with dinner!  (You do have to go up to the bar and ask for it though.)

Service was middle of the road.  But it's a buffet, so who cares; I was able to find ketchup on my own."}
{"text":"5pm seating and food was old and cold in hot stations.  Abundant crab legs and shrimp.  Dessert offerings were disappointing.  Keep in mind, this is a $40 buffet.  Sorry,  but for my $$$ we weren't impressed."}
{"text":"We actually went here a few years ago and I thought it was average at best. 

During our recent trip, we were pleasantly surprised and impressed with both the quality and selection here. 

I like the stations that are split into cuisines and the price is a bit more than average, but the food quality is also. Little things like artisan cheeses and seasonal frozen yogurt flavors like peach sorbet and eggnog were a nice touch.

The chef was really nice and accommodating to my wife making her special requests. The line was a bit long to get in, but that's because it's one of the few buffets that honors MyVegas rewards during the holidays. 

We didn't stay here and traveling anywhere along the strip is tough, but this was a worthwhile visit for us! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"There are some great things and not so great things about this buffet.   

What I enjoyed:
 omelet station- I like being able to pick what is in my omelet.   I do suggest that they put omlete toppings somewhere visible so people know what the options are or at least put up a sign/ menubof choices.   

1/2 of my bloody Marys.    The first and last ones ordered was just from a mix and just tasted like tomato,  the others the bar tender put mix and vodka 

The seafood soup-tomoato based.   I had clams,  muscles,  squid and a nice broth.   

Oysters were good

Salad bar- cute bowls... I just suggest they work on the order of getting items.   Most people make their salads by putting lettuce,  toppings then dressing.   Having the dressings in the middle causes lots of akward bumping around.   

Chicken fried steak is good,  but the gravy needs work.   It taste like the flour hasn't been cooked through  so not so pleasant. 

The meat and cheese station had a good selection... But no bagles to go with the lox 

Nice big beverage section,  not sure if it is too big

Granted I did not eat everything

What needs work,  besides what was mentioned above

Breakfast items,  scattered all over the place.   It would be nice if they were put together more.   

Scrambled eggs looked unappealing ..i didn't get them,  but while standing in line for an omelet another lady showed her friend and it did look like tofu and were wiggly.  

Sushi rice is hard,  taste like store bought.  

Extra paper napkins would be nice to put my fork and knife on.   I will not leave on a table so my cloth napkin looked like a little kid used it. 

Like I said I did not eat everything thing.  It is decent but needs some improvements"}
{"text":"Very limited selection. Literally a carving station and backed chicken. Not very impressed and wasn't worth the money."}
{"text":"I've made about four visits to Cravings the last couple of times I was in Vegas, lunch and dinner.  Some were planned, some weren't.  All visits were positive.

The food selection is great.  They have a great salad bar.  They also have a bar with some TVs.  There's a seafood section towards the back and also a noodle section that serves wonton and Pho.

There is also the meats and pizzas and all the other misc stuff.

If you have not been there, give Cravings a try."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Mirage and went for the champagne brunch. It was nothing spectacular but it wasn't bad. They have a very large selection, even for brunch, from sushi to omelettes made-to-order, and the stations are clean. Unlimited mimosas and champagne was a nice touch. 

We weren't clamoring to go back, but it was convenient and nothing was bad. Honestly I am just not a huge fan of buffets, and Vegas buffets, while grandiose, aren't really an exception for me. There are so many phenomenal restaurants on the strip you can experience for the same price. 

Service was speedy and friendly. Coffee was kind of weak..."}
{"text":"SO MUCH TO CHOOSE FROM! 

I had such a delicious experience here that I can't even remember how much lunch was. Anywho, once you get seated, you take a look around and you lost track of everything. There is so much to choose from and they had this cinnamon honey bun...I think and it was like eating a churro. Liked it so much I went back and got two more. 

The drinks are self serve. You're a grown adult, don't complain if they don't bring you your dink. Also, the dessert section was....I don't even know where I was gonna start. 

Vegas literally means buffets in my books!"}
{"text":"BARF!  The duck was overcooked, the rice was undercooked, and the gelato was frozen solid.  Spend a few bucks more and head over the to the Wynn Buffet.  You work hard for your money.  Treat yourself to something palatable!"}
{"text":"Living in Las Vegas, I typically don't do the strip unless I have friends or family visiting. Twice a year my family comes to visit and we love to go to Cravings at the Mirage.

The food is always fresh, the hot food is piping hot, the cold food is cold. Self service drinks, so no waiting on refills. If you're like me, and love to have different things to sip on during meals, you can pick and chose what you like also. 

There is free beer and wine with the meals. Not much of a selection, but it does the job. My family loves this buffet, and usually stays at the Mirage, so it's convenient for them. What more can I say that hasn't already been said? It's good, free beer and wine and gets me full. I like it!"}
{"text":"The wife and I consider ourselves to be pretty experienced buffet goers. We were with friends who can't stand buffet's and we had to really sell them on the idea, especially at $25. We were all staying at The Mirage and have never tried their buffet, so in we went. The wife and I were excited when we saw the variety from a distance, but when we got closer, were really surprised at how little food there was. On top of that, the food was terrible! I almost broke my tooth on the stale pot stickers. The prime rib was cold and flavorless. The guy who makes your salad reminded us a lot of 'The Soup Nazi' from Seinfeld. It literally took our server 15 minutes to get a diet Roy Rogers (Diet Coke with Grenadine). I am a HUGE dessert fan and this place really was a joke. They must be spending our $25 on the dolphin exhibit, cause it isn't being spent on good food. They should fire their food prep people and get a new decorator. The booth seat I was in felt like I was leaning against a wall. We came in around 4 pm, which is between lunch and dinner, but they had just started their dinner service so shouldn't the food have been fresh and hot?"}
{"text":"My cravings went away as soon as I tried this crap. 70bucks for 2 and I was pissed. Not really upset, but come on! The wife gave it a zero. I'm waiting for a new beef strip loin to come out as I'm typing this review hoping to salvage this meal. The first price of beef I had was way over done and been sitting on the line too long it seems like. I don't feel the love in the food here. Maybe it's a Bay thing."}
{"text":"Classic buffet that isn't over the top at all! Average at best for 32 bucks, but if you want to get boozed up after eating, it's a good deal. All the beer and wine is included. 
If you hit the info booth outside, they will offer you a 30% discount coupon that will bring your meal price down to 22 bucks! Worth it then! 
Liza was way too cool! Don't tip when first paying at booth. Leave tip at table if waitress cleans up after you! 
Hey, you're in Vegas, gotta try a buffet! This one wasn't it though, lol."}
{"text":"Great food, nice ambience, large variety of food to try, attentive service, competitive price.


Would not go back to bellagio buffet after trying this out."}
{"text":"I have to eat at Cravings whenever I'm in town.  I don't care how hung over I am, or how much money I've lost, I will eat prime-rib, eggplant parm, sugar-free hazelnut gelato, sushi, sugar-free cheesecake, crab legs, fried shrimp, fried chicken, sausage, ham, bacon, smoked salmon, meat n' cheese, and salad.  If you think that's gross, you should catch me when I'm not on my diet.

The last time I was here, my friend Cynthia and I never actually dined together.  It was more of a tag-team (not the Whoomp! There it is! kind).  Somehow, whenever one was eating, the other was going up for more food.  Next time, I'll be the 2 plates-at-a-time kind of girl."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. Good selection of food. Would not be my first choice to eat."}
{"text":"Got a buy one get one free. Buffet was large and everything was labeled if it was gluten free or not. Thank you"}
{"text":"Go for breakfast! We went on a Tuesday morning at 9am and was blown away by the variety, quality and freshness of everything! There was no wait and lots of healthy options. (Went to Grand Lux yesterday and paid the same $19.50 but there was a line up, not many buffet options, only your traditional greasy breakfast items. The only thing they did better was the fresh-squeezed orange juice). Cravings has your traditional breakfast items plus omelet station, breakfast burritos, French toast, eggs bennies, lox, carving station, tons of fresh fruit and like 30 different kinds of mini pastries... just to name a few."}
{"text":"prime ribs are really tender.  I found the salami counter before I got really full but it's delicious , darn it . 

listen to a chinese guy,  don't waste your time on their chinese food counter.  and the sushi ,too."}
{"text":"We got Cravings coupons at the Half Price Ticket booth. We got the champagne brunch buffet for 11.99 a person, so we saved about 50%. Brunch lasts til 3 pm, while dinner begins at 3pm, so we decided to go at 2:30pm, this way we could get dinner items too. I had heard and read great things about this buffet, and a few people had told me it was among the top 5 buffets on the strip, however I disagree. It was very good, but I think there are numerous better buffets. I absolutely adored the dessert selection! They had a wide variety of classic cakes, multiple gourmet desserts, as well as several sugar free and gluten free options. I found the creme brulee and lemon bars especially delicious. I also thoroughly enjoyed the king crab legs, guacamole, and clam chowder. Their soda machines were cool too. On the other hand, they had a pretty limited selection of sushi and italian, and a lot of the buns, muffins, and rolls were a bit too hard and didn't taste fresh at all. All in all, I'm satisfied and it was really good especially for the price paid, but I think there are plenty of better buffets in Vegas that should be gone to before Cravings."}
{"text":"Avoid the buffet!  We just spent over $70.00 for two people.  We have eaten here before.  It is not worth the money.  Strictly mediocre. It wasn't actually bad.  It just was not good.  Bland, uninteresting, dull food.  It has gone down hill.  Better spend you money on a nice meal at a specialty restaurant, rather than a buffet with a lot of choices, none of which are worth buying."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times separated by a couple of years.  I liked it better the first time I went.  There is a large selection of items but the best ones were the Asian food and some of the seafood.  None of the food however is outstanding.  The deserts and other items are missing something, maybe they are made from a box instead of from scratch.

If you are really hungry and have some time on your hands, it might be a good option but you might be better on spending your money at a restaurant where the food will be higher quality."}
{"text":"We are there last night.... the food was not good at all! I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their money on this buffet."}
{"text":"I ate here twice for breakfast, awesome. Great stuff like sweet plantains, lox and bagels, great cheese selection and a great hispanic foods area. When I was here last week it was $16 including coffee and juices, that is a great bargain. I unfortunately did not get the chance to have dinner here, but if you can eat breakfast here then absolutely do so."}
{"text":"Arrived for late lunch and what a big letdown. Service was good but the food not very good quality. Do not go there for the unlimited beer and wine. The only 2 beers available was Budlight and \"House special beer\" which tasted like piss water. For the price, we thought it would be much better. Just my honest opinion. We left a nice tip to our server because it is not her fault management does not provide a good buffet."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite buffet in Vegas many years ago, so I decided to give it a try this past Sunday, and I was very disappointed! 

Following are the reasons why: 

1. $30 per person for brunch?!(Easter Weekend) 

2. Our hostess was arguing loudly with the front personnel all the way to our table, over the head phone. 

3. Although there were many stations(Carvings, Noodle, Raw Bar, Salad, Omelet Bar, Latin, Pasta, Dessert etc.) but nothing looked appetizing, some items even looked like they were defrosted from pre-made frozen packages. 

4. Low Quality Foods: The Crab legs were still frozen, the hand rolls weren't made to order, and looked stale. I had them made a crepe for me, and it was the worst soggy, oily, oddly shaped crepe I've ever had! The wonton noodle soup was very bland, and the wonton was way over cooked with unknown filling. They've donuts and muffins at their dessert bar....am I at Home Town Buffet? why would anyone want to spent this much money for donuts & muffins?? 

The only pleasant experience I had was our waitress, who was friendly and attentive, and the prime rib was tasty. Other than that, Cravings really need to step up in order for people wanting to crave it!!"}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant at trying out Cravings after reading some of these reviews. However, our stay in Las Vegas was this time with the Mirage, so we ended up going to Cravings after all.  We went there for lunch and paid 18.50 per person, which is an ok price.  Unless you're looking to go to McDonalds or another fast food chain restaurant, that's about the price you'll end up paying per person for a decent meal anywhere around here, so it wasn't too daunting.
I ended up giving Cravings 3 stars, based on my findings below.

First of all, service was excellent.  I'd rate it 5 stars if I could separate service & food stars.  Our drinks were always filled, in fact, most of the time we'd barely emptied half our glasses before the waitress/attendant came and topped off the drink.  Also, our plates were promptly cleaned up once we were done with a course, and the waitresses/waiters & greeters were VERY friendly.  
So kudos to the staff @ Cravings, keep up the good work.

Let's move on to what we're here for.... food!  I think the easiest way to rate and comment on this would be station by station.

Mexican/Latin Foods - very disappointing.  In fact, my husband even asked if there truly was a Mexican chef there or if they'd hired a British chef to handle the Latin food.  (No offense to British chefs out there that are good at all types of cuisines.... he was just playing off stereotypes, obviously.... Gordon Ramsay probably cooks better Mexican food than any Latin chef out there ;-))
ANYWAY, the plantains - huge disappointment. I love plantains, I was very excited to see them but the taste was off.  The enchiladas were not very good either, and I didn't attempt the taco fixings but I'm assuming those were ok since theres not much to prepare in way of cooking those...

BBQ - fairly tasty! :-)  They redeem themselves some!! I had a wonderful veal brisket with a tangy BBQ sauce on the side.  The sweet potato salad w/spicy mustard was also good.   They had a cornbread \"pie\" which was awesome, very smooth, and their BBQ beans were great.  I'm definitely a fan of the BBQ section of \"Cravings\".

Carving Station - Two thumbs up!! I had the thickest, juciest slices of turkey on my plate and they were not cheap on the servings, I was a very happy camper while endulging in the delights of the carving station.

Chinese - Meh.  Middle of the road, not a big selection of good stuff, but enough to satisfy any craving for Asian foods.  Nice eggrolls.

Sushi - I'll have to rely on my husband for this review as I'm not a big fan of sushi.  He said it was great, he complemented the Sushi chefs... the sushi were just the right size and they had a good variety.

Salad bar - Awesome! Great selection of fresh cold cuts! 

Fishmonger/Raw bar - no comment, didn't visit those so I can't judge, however the selection was not very good and whatever they had there, didn't look too tempting....

Italian - Middle of the road, ok selection of pizzas.

Dessert -  Pretty tasty.  Best Napoleon Cake I've tasted in a long time! Also their chocolate mousse was fantastic, with chunks of chocolate bites in there, and the bread pudding was also very good.  Nice selection of sugar free desserts as well, and they tasted good... not \"sugar free\"

All in all though, I must say you can find better buffets in Vegas for less... I probably won't be choosing Cravings in the future."}
{"text":"Went for the Sunday brunch and there was everything you could think of. Sushi, Mexican, breakfast, American, seafood, desserts... Wine and Beer bar. There was nothing I had that wasn't delish... The lady even gave me a big mimosa to go cup. Added bonus, I had points on my mlife account to get a buy one - get one!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. It is not as expensive as the other buffets, however the food is just as good! I like their variety of foods. Every section has a big ass label so you won't be able to miss out or not find what you want. They have Chinese, Italian, Mexican, Seafood, Cocktails, American (Pizzas, French Toast, etc), Salad, and Dessert. Everything was pretty good...Except their limited dessert selection. Oh yeah, brunch comes with champagne so pretty much unlimited mimosas. They kept refilling our champagne without giving us dirty looks hahaha.

Service was excellent and food was good. No complaints."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. We went to the buffet around 4pm and were initially shocked by how few options they had under each food family. Also the food appeared to have been sitting out. We should have known better but we proceeded to eat there anyway. I had the worst food poisoning of my life after eating here. The next 24 hours were absolutely hell. I would recommend steering clear of this buffet and the Mirage in general."}
{"text":"I bought a travel zoo voucher for Cravings at the Mirage and so glad I did.  The quantity of choices are slim - compared to other buffets around town but the quality of food was very good.  The only thing I didn't really care for was the desserts.  I felt it could have been better."}
{"text":"So did breakfast brunch via Myvegas slots rewards and got 2 for 1 special. Normally is $35/ person which is pricey.

Included the buffet and all you can drink beer, wine, mimosas which made up for the cost but overall food was good and you have a good selection of type of food from Mexican, Asian, American, etc.

Was able to walk right in and seated promptly. If you are staying far I recommend taking the monorail instead of a cab and get off at Harrahs. 
It's right across the street."}
{"text":"This is really a 2.5.  What lies between MEH and A-OK?   OK.  Like the first Matrix sequel.  Not bad.  Not good.  Just OK.

Typically I stay at the Mirage when I Vegas and so I try to slip into the Cravings for breakfast.  I would not say anything is gourmet or jaw dropping, but you can put together almost any breakfast you can imagine reasonably enough.  

Unfortunately, the most disappointing aspect of the breakfast is the lame 80's era hotel coffee.  Mirage -- you don't have to serve Starbucks.  Go to a local Panera or Einsteins Bagels to get an idea of what you should be serving.  Something smooth with some flavor.  Not bland weak nothingness.   You should be embarrassed at this point.

I've read other reviews that indicate this buffet used to rule Las Vegas.  I'm not really convinced any buffet can rule much of anything.  I tried to over-rated Wynn buffet and the far superior Paris buffet and I'm simply not sold on the idea that any buffet can challenge a reasonably good restaurant.  But that's not why buffets are in Vegas.  They are there to offer cheap fast eats.  They are cafeterias with delusions of grandeur.

The Cravings is a decent 'cafeteria' if you will.  The sushi lacks fish, the shrimp is plump and bottomless, the coffee (again) sucks, and they'll toss you a tasty salad of your dreams.  Like I said, it's OK... for a buffet.

The Mirage has been good about updating itself and I think it's time my favorite affordable resort re-invent the buffet.  Scrap the silly name.  Pull the Studio 54 gold and mirrors out of the interior.  

I'm hearing good things about what the Cosmopolitan is doing it.  Take what works and fix what doesn't over there, bring it to the Mirage.  Charge higher prices to people walkin' in off the street but give resort guests a bold discount -- and name said discount as a benefit of the resort fee."}
{"text":"Decent enough.  Big buffet lots of options but nothing that makes my tastebuds go \"WOW\".  

The biggest win comes from the alcohol.  . 

Unlimited mimosas!!!!!!!!  On that fact alone I plan on coming back.  It's 1045am and the pool and Vegas heat are calling my name."}
{"text":"Color me unimpressed.
I found much of the food that should be soft to be hard because it was sitting under the warmers for so long.  
Absolutely lackluster and only a few steps above Old Country Buffet.
I give it two starts for the following good points:
-cheesecake was actually delicious
-the guy who made my salad was really nice
-very attentive waiter who refilled sodas promptly and took dishes away immediately
Absolutely not worth $25 for dinner."}
{"text":"Okay, honestly this is kind of disappointed buffet experience I have ever had. The foods are just foods, nothing really impressed me. I got 30% off coupon at the outside, but I would rather spend more on better places.
For example, the fruit are not sweet and fresh at all."}
{"text":"i went for dinner on Saturday.

Decent buffet. (I think all the buffets are starting to taste the same)

The salmon sushi was surprisingly very good! As well as the seaweed salad. It tasted just like the ban chan at korean restuarants! 

I also enjoyed the gelato...hazelnut and pineapple mango...both were delicious!"}
{"text":"Yummy. Prime rib, chipotle chicken, french fries. It was all good! Best of all there was no line. Got here today at 2:40pm. Paid for lunch and stayed for dinner. Other buffets uave ridiculous lines. Staff was friendly and refilled drinks frequently."}
{"text":"I first visited the Cravings Buffet at Mirage in 1992, and as I recall, the price was $4 per person all you can eat.  While the food is still great, I think it is about $30 per person or more now."}
{"text":"My typical experiences at a buffet. 

1. I get my moneys worth no matter what the price is, I repeat, no matter what the price is. 
2. I eat to the point of almost puking. 
3. Not 28 bucks w/ gratuity. 

What on Earth went wrong at Cravings?! Please consider renaming to Loss of Appetite. Nothing I repeat, nothing looked tempting enough to reach my plate. 

I ate a couple slices of prime rib, guacamole and chips, some steak, fruits, done. 

Everything else tasted old.

The gf went irate because I was not eating. Am I sick?"}
{"text":"Well it was... Ehhh... Ok. Nothing special, nothing wrong. Just ok. Have to admit the ladies at the register, the hostess and our waiter Juan, were all very nice and attentive. We felt welcome. The guy in the Chinese soup area was not friendly at all. 

As for the food... Great miso soup, the tabbouleh was the best I've ever had and had awesome raspberry mouse. My hubby said his chili was good but I have to say that he didn't get seconds of anything and seemed pretty bored with most of the food. 
It's probably about average for buffets and it wasn't outrageously expensive. 
We left thinking we may not buffet again while we're in town. (But I'm sure there is someplace we'll hit up for all you can eat bacon!)"}
{"text":"The set of up this buffet is pretty nice (except for the totally strange cold seafood bar that is hidden in a back wall) - the food is good, not as good as Mandalay Bay's buffet, but totally solid.  I was really impressed with their made to order tossed salad and their Italian selection (never had a good pasta dish at a buffet, yet this one pulled off a very nice linguine with clam sauce).  The prime rib was good as well.

I don't think I would ever go out of my way to eat here again, but I would definitely eat here if I was in Mirage and wanted a buffet.  Service was okay, but the place was empty when we were there for dinner and yet our drinks only got refilled once."}
{"text":"This review pertains to the breakfast buffet. I have been to several breakfast buffets in Vegas and so far this is my favorite. TONS of options. Omelets, eggs benedict, waffle, pancakes, sausage, bacon, etc. Their fresh fruit selection was fantastic! I was also amazed at the HUGE selection of muffins, rolls, and pastries to choose from. Free beer and wine was also great. Everything was kept fresh and nothing had that sitting there buffet feel to it. I loved it and would definitely come back, especially considering the price."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating a salad for Bk. It's been awhile since I've eaten at Cravings. I was very disappointed and over paid $41.11 for two...for such little choices I had for Bk. The over price amount was included with unlimited bud light and wine. Good choice but we'll not worth it when you're looking to stuff your face with FOOD!! I'll have to try lunch to were I'll have to spend more to just get my salad I was looking forward to"}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food! Legit the most amazing buffet I've ever attended. Value for money and lovely service"}
{"text":"The mirage buffet is worth it when you buy the $2 discounted ticket price at Tix 4 tonight. Instead of paying $36 per person, we ended up paying only $20.99 not including tax and the $2 ticket. 

Sushi was a bit disappointing and old looking. Atmosphere and food was good. I really enjoyed the custom made pasta bar. There's a chef that makes you pasta and it's delicious! Snow crab legs, peeled shrimp, rib eye steak was my favorite. This buffet was good overall, not to mention that dining at The Mirage is also great too."}
{"text":"The food here was good and I woul come back. I liked the layout of the buffet where it was spaced throughout the whole room so you didn't get clumping and lines for food. Also, the different styles of food were clearly labeled. They had a wide range of food options, from latin to chinese to barbeque. I wish they would have had more traditional foods though. For example, their noodle bar was more dimsum and Asian oriented but I would have loved an Italian noodle bar similar to that at Treasure Island. Everything I tried was great. The desserts were yummy and included gelato selections. The wait staff was nice and was good at removing your plate. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"It's vegas and it's expected that the buffets are expensive but the food was only ok (cafeteria quality food)."}
{"text":"The selection of food for this buffet ranged from American, to Mexican, to Chinese, to Italian to Sushi and dessert! Not to mention the open bar! I came for brunch,the food was good however I think that the there's a better selection dinner."}
{"text":"Stuffed!!!

Attentive service, bottomless drinks which includes Goose IPA on draft, great prime rib, good selection and all appeared fresh and presented to standard even in last hour of service. 

Definitely worth a try and for the drinks alone you get your monies worth."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good! We got a 2 for 1 coupon through the myvegas app. Dinner was around 30 something for the two of us with the coupon. There really is something here for everyone. Although, I did not like everything I put on my plate, there was SO much that I did enjoy. I appreciated the self serve drink station that offered soda, juice, coffee, tea and hot chocolate. Beer and wine are also included in the price which is pretty nice. The crab legs and desserts were my favorite."}
{"text":"This buffet is sick. In the sense that I get sick after eating here. Cravings has a bountiful assortment of food with no taste, or maybe the taste of expired food. Anybody who rates this buffet as five stars has absolutely lost their mind. Desserts are fresh from the grocery store!"}
{"text":"My favorite not hyped up buffet in Vegas.  The lines are typically manageable, prices are reasonable, but the food and atmosphere is awesome.  

Wide wide selection of food that you can expect from a nice buffet, and also clean, well-maintained and spacious dining area.  

Sure, the Wynn has more bells and whistles, but it didn't blow me away.  So why wait in long lines, sit at cramped tables, and pay more for the same buffet quality food?  Cravings hits my sweet spot in the price/quality/atmosphere equilibrium."}
{"text":"I used a 2 for 1 deal from myVegas app for dinner.  The setup is a big U and have to trek it from one side to the other. 

The service was something. Very nice but all they can do is clear the plates. They don't bring you any drinks anymore! You have get your own sodas, juice, beer, and wine. Beer selection is Bud Light or Goose Island IPA. Beer and wine are included with price of buffet.

After reading Yelp reviews, I focused only on their chilled shrimp, crab legs, and prime rib. Good stuff. I tasted a pork rib which was alright and really didn't eat anything else. I'm a happy person. 

The dessert section in most all buffets are a let down, like this buffet too. Save the calories and get more crab legs!"}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict: Hollindaise sauce was hard

Chicken: Borderline raw and looks better than it tastes

Ribs: Meat was ok, sauce was not good

Broccoli Beef: Literally the worst

Wonton Soup: Their specialty. Brett wouldn't stop raving about it

Crab Legs: We didn't taste these since we heard they come from the Bellagio fountain but they work well as back scratchers (joke)

Salad bar: My gawd this was embarrassing

Coffee: Water with a bit of coffee flavor

Beer: Pretty good

Mimosas: Pretty whatevs

Wine: Too sweet

Diane, our waitress was very nice and did a great job.

Although the food at this place was the worst we've had in a long time, the atmosphere was good enough for us to stay for 4 hours and bottomless mimosas and beers certainly helped."}
{"text":"This is the third buffet in Vegas at which I have eaten (the other two were at Rio and Paris), and I see no reason to stop my search for an excellent Las Vegas buffet. 

This is one of the moderately priced buffets on the Strip - it costs 27$ a person for dinner. The food is more exquisite then simply pizza and burgers, but I was still not very impressed. I had the following items:

Pizza - Pretty good, but nothing exceptional
Prime Rib - Likely the tastiest part of the meal: Great and unlimited
Fajitas - God awful
Chips & Guacamole - Surprisingly good guacamole for a buffet.
Pork Buns - I've had better in a college dining commons.
Sushi - Very small selection of rolls (tuna, avocado, and that's about it), and none of them are any good.

So, overall, the food was standard, except the prime rib. I had been expecting a luxury buffet with restaurant- quality food. If you are expecting that, I don't think this will be for you."}
{"text":"Huge waste of money. We paid $84 for a dinner buffet for 2 people. That's almost $100 wasted on bland, no flavor food . The buffet wasn't even that big and if you dont like seafood there's really not much for you. My advice: spend your money on a more upscale vegas buffet. The bowls where you get the frozen yogurt were also dirty. My boyfriend had to literally wipe the dirt away and after grabbing about 4 bowls we finally found a clean one."}
{"text":"All of their food were good. Bottomless drinkinging option with Beer and Wine is a plus. Italian station Pasta is really good. Latin section beef is really good. There are few items od Sushi which are good as well. Salmon is baked and lottle friend which gives it smoky. Food quality pricewise is really recommended."}
{"text":"As many have mentioned, the showing up before 11 AM and getting lunch and breakfast food for the low ( less than $15) price, is an awesome deal. This buffet is bright and clean, and I find the food quite good for a buffet. Also, the lines aren't nearly as long as Wynn or others."}
{"text":"Decided I wanted buffet on our last day in Vegas.  I checked Yelp and decided to go to Cravings.  Hence the name, I sure had no cravings here.  Perhaps, I went a bit too early. I got there at 9am.  Nothing was available to eat until 11am.  Nothing tasted fresh here.  The only reason for 1 star is because the waitress was nice.  She came around enough times.  The best thing I ate was the lemon poppy seed muffin. Besides that EVERYTHING was gross.  

No cravings at CRAVINGS.  I really don't know what lunch or dinner taste like or if I were to come at 11am instead but breakfast SUCKS! Complete waste of money.  I feel bad for having to drag my bf along to eat a horrible breakfast.

Barf."}
{"text":"This buffett was a HUGE disappointment. Thank God we got a Travelzoo deal. There was nothing memorable and all of the food was cold. There were also little gnats flying around inside. It was completely dead. Was so happy that our Travelzoo included free beer and wine. Bottom of the barrel taste but that was expected. Could not understand a word our server said (heavy accent). After being disappointed with the fatty dishes I decided to try for the salad. You get to choose the ingredients and they toss it for you. That sounded promising but it was a fail. The lady put way too much of the overpowering ingredients (ie onions) and the salad was ruined. The desserts looked good but they were not. The cheesecake was sugarless and tasteless. The cannoli was not good at all. Even the frosting on the cupcake tasted special. With all of the buffett choices on the strip, this is not a good one. Even with the half off travelzoo deal I would not return to this place. I hear the buffett at the Cosmopolitan is worth checking out so I will do that next time. Oh also the food stations did not have standard dishes as you would expect. Cheese enchiladas at the mexican stand? Nope. Orange chicken or chow mein at the Chinese stand? Nope. So disappointing."}
{"text":"For $37 bucks per person...totally not worth it. Food is average at best, service (at the back bar) was attentive.  For reviews saying this is best food they've ever had...those folks must not travel much because there is absolutely nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"The buffet dinner was fantastic, especially with unlimited beer and wine. Good thing we took a shuttle. Besides the toughness of the roast beef everything else was good."}
{"text":"Free buffet  thanks to myvegas .
They have self  serve drink stations  now. Free beer and wine.
Haven't been here in a long time , but the food was surprisingly  good.  They have hot and cold crab legs for dinner .
Desert station could use a little improvement  though."}
{"text":"Food was great! Service is good! Totally worth it for the price. But be mindful, you'll have to wait for a long time."}
{"text":"all you can drink and all you can eat brunch.  this was the best part of my vegas trip.  also had a buy one get one free...thanks myvegas!!  

i will be coming back to this brunch every time i come to vegas in the future!"}
{"text":"Good buffet! Like the inclusive beer and wine; most other places charge you $12 for this option. Prime rib and turkey at carving station, pizza, desserts, and pulled pork were excellent!"}
{"text":"This buffet is so underrated in my opinion. Someone in our group recommended this place and I was super surprised at how good it was! I've been to almost every buffet in vegas like wicked spoon at cosmo, bacchanal at ceasars, the buffet at the wynn, etc...and this one was as good if not better than the others! (yes I'm a fatty and proud of it).

Service: Doesn't really matter at a buffet because you serve yourself. In my opinion, my service was excellent, so no complaints. Got up and got food real quick. BUT if you want to be nitpicky, it did take a little while to get seated when the line was short, then it again our group was 18 deep so understandable.

Food: SO MUCH FOOD. The food wrapped around the whole room and it seemed to be endless. So many different food stations. As with all buffets, there was a crab leg section but no lame shortages here, it always seemed to be full of crab legs and no super long lines for it. When I do buffets I like to take a small bite out of every dish, and even doing this I couldn't eat everything I wanted because there was just too much food. Everything tastes fresh and delicious too. And finally there was FREE beer and wine. Not just cheap beer either, it was a house IPA, Heineken, and some other beer that I can't remember; probably because i had too many IPAs and Heinekens. 

Place: Upscale, clean, and tons of space. Plenty of room around you to eat and not feel like anyone near you is judging you.

One of the best buffets in vegas in my opinion. PROTIP: Do buffet for lunch instead of dinner so you don't feel terrible about yourself on those vegas nights."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars after comparing it to Wynn's buffet the previous night! 

Everything is really good! They have more variety & the room/tables are super spacious. They even have a gelato bar. This place is awesome because at the Asian counter, they make fresh soups and noodles for you like Pho, won ton, and duck soup. Their roasted turkey is the best turkey I've ever had! I prefer that over their prime rib. Desserts are awesome and fresh.

I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"$25.00 brunch buffet with unlimited mimosa's. 

They offer a whole lot of \"global\" options with very little flavor. 

Half of the items I tried were luke warm, tough, chewy, or just plan tasteless. (boudin sausage, potatoes, fried plantains, ribs, pork chops, dim sum, chilaquiles etc.)

I didn't go near the raw bar or fish monger section. It smelled really fishy and not at all appetizing. 

The other half was decent. Roast chicken was tender, chow mein was flavorful and the sushi was suprisingly fresh and delicious. A first at a buffet.

Come for a first time, but check out another buffet for a second time."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Had an amazing experience 3 years ago. Now the food is subpar. Had better hospital food"}
{"text":"Sister and I got the champagne buffet at half price $18 vs $36 due to running the Rock and roll marathon. Excellent selection of seafood and other goodies. Wish my belly was bigger. Not sure if $36 would be worth it though but we were happy with our half priced buffet."}
{"text":"i came here 3-4 years ago and remember enjoying it. however this time around it wasnt nearly as great. we came in for brunch and with 12 people gratuity was included for a total of ~  $28 per person. 

the majority of my meal consisted of breakfast choices....waffles, sausage(rubber?), eggs, hashbrowns...

the highlight for mee was the fresh pineapples, grapefuit, &the prime rib...the prime rib + horseradish was the only thing that made me feel like i got my moneys worth. it was really tasty considering that the carved meats usually arent that appealing to me at buffets.

 the chinese section, seafood, churro, ESPECIALLY dessert was all very mehhhh...soo not worth wasting my hunger. 

cravings....psh i never have nor will i ever crave you!"}
{"text":"This place is MASSIVE. 
They offer military discount to AD and retired! 
(50%!!!) 
Great selections.
Almost all of the sushi is cooked, which makes this pregnant lady happy! 
The fried won tons and bread pudding are the best! 
Only giving it a 4 since we went at lunch and there were no crab legs. AND because the breakfast items were in such random places: eggs Benny and French toast in the Italian section with pizza and pasta??? Cereal and yogurt with fixings with the deli and salad bar??? Weird."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday evening, and we got 2 buffets for $42 (We used a casino BOGO, $37.82 with tax). The meal also came with unlimited wine and beer. 

- We came around 8pm, which was a great time for us because we didn't have to wait in line for a while. There was just 1 couple ahead of us. I thought that was pretty good for a Saturday night. It took less than 10min for us to be seated at our table. 
- I suggest starting off with the shrimp cocktails and crab legs. The line can get pretty long, but if you time it right, your meal will start off great. The shrimp cocktails are pretty big too compared to Feast Buffet. Crab legs not as meaty as Bellagio. 
- Their wanton soup was pretty good but not as good as the Rio Carnival World. 
- Prime rib was average like any other buffet like Feast, but there is no grill if you wanted it Med-well or well done like Sam's Town. 
- I did enjoy their seafood stew. It had a lot of scallop and clams in it, less small shell bits, few corn. 
- Avoid the steamed cod. It was a bit tough and flavorless. 
- Do mack on the BBQ spare ribs! It was tender and so saucy! I loved it. It was especially tasty with the creamed corn. I love corn! :D nom nom
- The sushi was filler for me so after a few, I didn't bother getting more
- Their dim sum was pretty good. I suggest that you should at least grab one of each. Don't get the Ramen though. The noodle tasted like Maruchan. meehhhhh! But I did really like the egg! 
- I don't care much for the desserts, but my girlfriend thought it was worth trying. Don't expect to find macarons here though!
- Although I did not drink the wine, I did get the beer. The choice was between a Bud Light or a pale ale. Each time I got a drink, there were at least 2 or 3 people ahead of me. I suggest double fisting to reduce the wait time. Haha. 
- Friendly service. Clean and fine dining."}
{"text":"Friday before Christmas, about 8:00 pm. and we were seated immediately. Maybe because there is an abundance of casino buffets, but it beats standing in a Disneyland-like line at our local casino.  Beverage service was immediate and we tied on the feedbag for round one.  Nicely laid out buffet with several stations of options. Salad bar allowed you to choose your greens, toppings and dressing and then have it hand-tossed by a staffer.  Served up in a nice deep bowl.  Somehow it just made it taste better and I didn't want to give it up.  A dribble of melted in a bowl and then a handful of crab legs.  A little on the smallish side - snow crab? Good, sweet, but alot of work for little yield.  Next stop was the noodle area - BBQ pork won ton noodles for me.  Not the greatest, but definitely a nice option.  Next plate = perfectly medium rare prime rib with a little scoop of corn, a dab of mashed potatoes to stick it together and a piece of pizza.  Last go-around included a pecan square, lemon tart, and  cranberry orange cookie, which miraculously found its way under a napkin and into my purse for later. Nice bedtime snack. Did I eat $27 worth? Probably not, but there were tons of options and most were not bad."}
{"text":"Went here twice during my trip and I really enjoyed it. The brunch part is pretty awesome as you get unlimited mimosas. (If only our server was a little faster at refilling like some of the other tables had)

Being a vegetarian I realized that it might be difficult to find non-meat options at a buffet but really didn't run into too much of a problem. I really enjoyed the salad bar. At first I was disappointed because you couldn't make your own but the person who made my salad made it perfectly. Of course they could've had more options like other buffets but for the price I paid I'm not complaining. 

Roughly you pay about $28 to eat here and that was fine with me."}
{"text":"I stayed for a week in this Hotel and this was my favorite place to have a good breakfast. You pay around $20 for a breakfast (all you can eat and drink) They have EVERYTHING! Donuts, fruit, omelets, French toast, Mexican, frozen yogurt, pancakes, bacon, sausage, grits, omg I can continue. I'm giving 5 starts because is very clean, they have good service, they have high chairs for kids. And I think that is a great price. I'm gonna miss it. 
Remember that breakfast is the main meal of the day :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a buffet person so I was reluctant but the free beer and wine with your dinner reeled me in. The food was pretty good. They had everything from pizza, Chinese, fish, to the carving of prime rib. They even had snow crab legs!! DMD liked them so much he got seconds. My favorite (besides the beer) were the chocolate chip cookies!!! Of course they had more than that for desert but I'm a cookie kind if girl."}
{"text":"Buffet 1   Janet  Nil

I will win the next one I swear!!!! When I walked into Cravings I thought I was hungry. I thought I would eat a lot. But I ended up eating only one plate!!!  At $28, I can tell you it was not worth it for me.  But overall, there were A LOT of choices at this buffet.  If I had an appetite I would have gone for more.  The food was sectioned off by region (Italian, Asian, American, etc) which was helpful.

Service was good. Our drinks were always refilled and our plates were quickly taken away.  My only complaint about this buffet is the dessert selection. THEY SUCK!!!!!!!! There was no chocolate cake,  no apple pie and no soft serve ice cream!!!! Although they had gelato, its not the same as soft serve!"}
{"text":"I am pretty happy with the service we received here. The price was half of what we paid at MGM buffet and the selection was much better."}
{"text":"Excellent food,service and then CHEF REMY, CHEF ENDHIR put a personal touch on the delicious food is just a great place to eat with friendly staff who make you feel home"}
{"text":"We decided to go for brunch based on online reviews and the free booze. There was a small food selection. Beer and wine are from the bar and be prepared to wait online for them. Food was bland, Chinese food was outright tasteless. Some selections of food were left near empty. Layout Is poor, you have to walk a significant distance to get to buffet and navigate through the maze of other people eating.  Not worth the money unless you want to sit around and drink mimosas, those are brought to you by the waitress."}
{"text":"**Summary**
       - Selection - The selection seemed to be limited and the food was mediocre at best.
       - Value - For the price we paid for dinner, I was expecting a little more. This seemed to be on the level of a $12 buffet but with crab legs and shrimp.
**Price**
       - $15.99 Breakfast Mon-Fri 7am-10am
       - $19.99 Lunch Mon-Fri 11am-3pm
       - $26.99 Dinner 3pm-10pm
       - $24.99 Champagne Brunch Sat-Sun 8am-3pm
**Items to note**
       - Prime Rib - The prime rib was overcooked and completely dry by the time I got back to my table.
       - Shrimp - The shrimps were of decent size for the price. I think this is the only item I couldn't complain about (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw?select=Kp3AOIz9Ztv38-gkYZdPCA).
       - Crab Legs - The crab legs were split and dry. The shell side was brown on most of them and it seemed like they were sitting there for way too long (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OVTZNSkSfbl3gVB9XQIJfw?select=YdVxZbw2SodAIWfmfwnbRw).
       - Deserts - The dessert selection was minimal and wasn't very good.
**Recommendations**
       - I wouldn't recommend this place. Stations has a better buffet for a cheaper price. If you're going for the higher priced items, Bellagio is a way better choice."}
{"text":"This place used to be good years ago it's going down hill food quality is below expectation for the price. I used to like it don't come here go to Bachannal at Ceasers Palace I like getting my money's worth this place just do sent cut it"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Best buffet I've had on the Strip. So many varieties of food and the desserts were awesome! Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"We were not overly impressed.  Glad we had not paid full price, we had a Travel Zoo voucher.  No stand out items except for the dessert section.  The best items were the turkey and mashed potatoes and gravy.  The Creme brûlée was very good.  Lemonade had a chemical taste to it.  Service was not vey good about keeping beverages filled."}
{"text":"This place was okay. There are so many buffets in Vegas and this one had decent amount of selections to choose from. But... their Asian Food section was a bit disappointing cuz it wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Average buffet. Food was descent. Price was good for what you get, unlimited beer and wine with the buffet price. Service was great. Would gladly go back again when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Staying at the TI and for a few dollars less went to the Mirage for their breakfast. At $14.95 it's pretty much the same price as a couple of coffees and pastries at one of the coffee shops. Getting there was just a question of taking the tram over.

Attractive entrance and lettering going into the restaurant with not much of a queue. 

Before anything else, I must mention that the service was excellent. Really go out of your way stuff. When they asked which juice, I asked for pineapple which they got from the room service section. Twice.  Enough to make me double my usual tip to the servers to a massive $2. 
( enough people come to the buffet leaving nothing making me look like one of the last BSD's.)

The food itself is fair with special mention being made of the positive: excellent croissants, omelette station and proper pork sausages. 

Negative is having to ask for yoghurt to be served, the croissants being in a refrigerated section ( which they will heat up on asking) and a slightly weird eggs Benedict. Bacon was so so and coffee was okay, but plentiful.
Also no real obvious toast.

No real wow factor compared to the outstanding Wynn or bellagio but they are more expensive with longer queues and further to get to. So if you want a fair feed, it'll do."}
{"text":"I know reviewing a buffet is like reviewing fast food, but honestly, I was pretty impressed with this one. Food as good if not better in some areas as the Belaggio buffet and better than the MGM which I had eaten twice that week.

Selection is a bit smaller than both of the afore mentioned, but things like a kick ass Prime Rib and awesome BBQ bar made up for it. The sushi was so-so (again, it's a buffet) and the veggies were REALLY good. You wanna spend $25 and get a really good all you can eat prime rib? There you go.

In a world where everyone has shitty soft-serve ice cream for desert, Cravings has fucking *gellato*. Honestly, right there, you guys win."}
{"text":"Great value. Unlimited beer and wine (mimosas on weekends - and they never let you see the bottom) included for a little under $40. Food is not bad but not great - pretty much what you'd expect from a Vegas buffet.

Went mostly to eat crab. There are chilled and steamed options which is nice. Not amazing - but you're still eating crab legs so how bad could it be? We ended up trying a lot of other things as well that looked appetizing. Nice variety and plenty of options especially for a family."}
{"text":"Typical Vegas buffet. You won't be blown away but it's better than cafeteria food. If you're settling for a buffet, you should be expecting this. If you want a good buffet, then go to Bellagio or the Wynn."}
{"text":"Went to the Cravings Buffet at the Mirage last night and all I can say it was the worse buffet
ever.  We got our table and the server told us way in the back you can get your drinks. I will bring your silverware. Really???  Servers don't even serve you drinks.  So I went and got our drinks.  They had about 6 soda fountain machines that only thing was available was lemonade and no ice on any of the machines.  two were completely out of order.  Stood in line where you can get beer and wine for about 10 minutes just to get a soda.  I sat down and my husband's plate looked horrible.  Well done prime rib and crab legs that you couldn't even crack open.  After that I went and got my food..  Mashed potatoes a piece of well done prime rib and dry Rigatoni.  The best thing they had was the bread pudding.  Needless to say after seeing Terry Fator's show which was awesome we went to Del Taco.  All this was 65.00 for the buffet plus tip.  We were so disgusted, wish we would of just asked for our money back before we ate and left."}
{"text":"Their lunch buffet was pretty good but nothing really stood out as amazing.  They have a decent variety of Italian, Mexican, Asian, salad, American, a few breakfast items, and dessert.

The carving station was solid, with turkey, ham, prime rib, and corned beef. The seafood was a plus, as the shrimp was tasty and the ciappano seafood soup impressed me. The Asian/sushi section was meh and the sushi mostly had disgusting mayonnaise in it and looked to be something from the grocery store. The pork chops at the American table were worth a try but sadly the desserts were uninspired and a little stale.

They do give you free beer and wine so that's a plus, especially if you can take your time and enjoy a few beverages. If you can get the free buffet passes this is definitely worth it and it's good but not great if you pay full fare."}
{"text":"$37 for lunch on a weekend. Includes beer, wine and bottomless mimosas. Just tip the bartender/server.

The food is just okay, but hell, I can drink my money's worth here. Prime rib was decent, crab legs not so much. Most items were just okay. Dessert section wasn't extravagant. 

No line either, so I guess that's a plus or a minus depending on what your perspective is."}
{"text":"Less than stellar for sure, seafood was a joke. All frozen and thawed tastes like water soaked crab and shrimp. Sushi was disappointing as well, no real \"fish\" in it is seems. Waste of $30."}
{"text":"TLDR - Average buffet at best. Decent selection of options, but most things aren't worth eating. Spend your $40 at an actual restaurant instead. 

My friends and I came for Sunday brunch for $36/person. Not sure if there are different prices for brunch and dinner, but brunch ends at 3pm. There's also free beer/wine until 3pm. We came exactly at 3pm though so technically we missed that, but our hostess still told us that beer/wine was free, although we didn't end up having any.

There's a decent selection of food, but nothing's really great. Honestly, my friends and I thought the best thing we had were the veggies... Your $40 would be better spent at a nice restaurant instead. 

HITS: broccoli (Italian), BBQ ribs and sauteed cabbage (American), crab legs and shrimp (fishmonger), bread pudding (dessert)

Overall, meats and fish were generally dry. Sushi and Asian food was terrible.

* AMERICAN
BBQ ribs were actually pretty good as long as you found a tender piece. Otherwise, the sauce was still good but dry meat was not worth eating. Same thing with the grilled flank steak - go for the tender, medium rare if you can find a slice. Sauteed cabbage was pretty good.

* LATIN AMERICAN
I only tried the Cajun chicken here, parts of which were okay, but mostly it was pretty dry. There's also chips and guac/salsa and some other things.

* ASIAN
Noodles, stir fry, seafood bun, spring rolls, potstickers, etc. I'd skip everything in this section

* SUSHI
I'd skip the sushi too. The fish in the rolls and nigiri wasn't very fresh and the rice was hard. 

* FISHMONGER
Probably your best bet here and where you'd get your money's worth. Crab legs and shrimp were pretty fresh.

* ITALIAN
The broccoli here was unanimously the best thing my group had (sadly). The pizza wasn't bad, but I'd skip the meats and fish. 

* CARVING
There was prime rib, portuguese sausage and turkey at the carving station. The prime rib was kind of inconsistent. I got an okay slice but some people got really dry parts. The portuguese sausage wasn't bad. There was also salmon (dry) and mac and cheese (solid) and some other things like mashed potatoes that I didn't try. 

* SALAD
Very simple salad options, bread (avoid please) and Italian meats like salami and ham.

* DESSERTS
Lots of options, including some sugar-free ones: cakes, cupcakes, bars, cookies, bread pudding, fruit, soft service ice cream/sorbet, etc. The cakes/cupcakes were pretty dry, the cookies were hard as rocks (how long ago were they made??), and fruit was rather acidic. Soft serve/sorbet was decent. The only thing I really liked here was their bread pudding, but make sure you get a freshly made batch of it.

There's also the CHEF'S KITCHEN, where they make you fresh pasta, but I didn't try any because I'm not really a pasta person."}
{"text":"Here's another buffet that I've been to on a few different occasions, but I've forgotten to write a review.  The Cravings Buffet at Mirage is certainly not a fancy buffet, but it works in a pinch.  It works even better if you can get it for free, or at a discounted price.  My wife and I used a MyVegas reward and got 2 free buffets to use at Cravings.  Now, I'm thankful that the meal was free, because had I paid full price I don't really feel like it would have been worth it, at least this time.

This buffet certainly has a lot of options, it's just that a lot of the food is mediocre.  We came here for lunch, and they still had their homemade omelette station going, so I nabbed one of those.  I enjoyed the omelette, but was having a tough time finding other options that interested me.  They do have a self-service drink station now, which consists of one of those fancy new coke machines.  You can also get coffee, milk, juice, etc.  Or, you can get free beer or wine, but the selection is limited.

I feel bad for the servers at this buffet, because they are essentially glorified buss boys.  All they did was clear a few of the plates off the table once, and then we never really saw them again.  It's kind of a pain to walk all the way to the other side of the room every time you need a refill.  No service=No tip.

I guess the thing that bugged me the most was their dessert station.  It was noon and they still had several of their breakfast items out there.  Sorry, but I'm not interested in donuts that have been sitting there for a few hours for dessert.  Many of the cupcakes offered were dry, and the creme brulee was subpar at best.  Also, they took away the homemade gelato and replaced it with ice cream machines.  Seriously??  What an awful substitute!

Anyway, I don't want to be too hard on this buffet, because it was free.  That said, I'm not sure that I'll be \"craving\" this place anytime soon."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. It's $5 cheaper than the Bellagio lunch buffet, and it was comparable in taste. Honestly, I don't know why everyone pees all over themselves when talking about the Bellagio buffet. If you don't consider the champagne included with brunch, it's not that fabulous.

I ate too much food, I don't remember everything that I ate. The sushi wasn't inviting (but sushi at a Las Vegas buffet is usually something to be avoided anyway). The prime rib was tasty (and also the first thing I went for). The most notable thing though, was the vanilla gelato. I nearly died at first bite. They must have put a gallon of egg yolks in it, because it was DELICIOUS. I have never had vanilla gelato quite like that, and I will likely never have it anywhere else. I would seriously pay the $16 or so just to have unlimited vanilla gelato. I am quite sad I didn't know the gelato was there to begin with, otherwise I would have just eaten that for all of lunch."}
{"text":"Ate here several times during my visit to Vegas this past December. Cravings has a huge selection of good food and we never had to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Pretty crappy food. Steaks are hard, desserts aren't savory and the overall quality isn't too good. Put your money at a restaurant, not this buffet."}
{"text":"After eating the buffet at Ceasar's anything would be a hard act to follow.  The food was not too bad for the price was not equal for its value.  They had unlimited house wine and a couple of beers to choose from.  The had a decent selection and the servers were nice.  We ate there around noon on a weekday.  I hear their brunch is better on the weekend.  I would say this was an overall average buffet experience.  Not bad but not exceptional."}
{"text":"A very interesting buffet place. I like the fact that they serve so many different ethnic foods. They don't just have your typical stuff. It was different and somewhat tasty. I don't usually like buffets, but this place is decent. There is a wide variety of choices. One of the better items I got was the Pesto Panini sandwhich. It was pretty tasty. Also, the mediterrian dishes were decent too. The dim sum was ok, but if you are not too picky about taste, this is a good place to go since the variety is pretty amazing."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best and the service is horrible. The server doesn't even deliver drinks to the table."}
{"text":"Cravings is just your typical above average buffet on the Strip and when I mean above average, I mean a notch above Excalibur and a notch below Bellagio in my honest opinion. 

The service here is excellent and the floor is very clean and well maintained compared to other strip buffets. My favorite part of the buffet is the seafood section because I'm such a huge fan of the big shrimp cocktail and the king crab legs!! 

Mmm mm TASTY!!...

The sushi section offers 4 different kinds of handrolls (Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail and Scallops), and 3 different kinds of Japanese salad, Soybeans, cut rolls and miso soup.

Meat section offers Turkey, Roast Beef, Prime Rib, Barbeque and other stuff. Then they have the Mexican, Italian and deli areas but the section that needs some work is the dessert section because you have to squeeze in between the dessert island and the cake shelf if there are other guests grabbing dessert and it just feels so cramped. 

Another thing that bothers me is the section between the seafood and Mexican food because you'd have to walk across a small part of the dining hall to get to the other section and I think it would be better if they extended the tile connecting both stations rather then walking on the carpet. 

Like the other Yelpers said it feels like eating in a cafeteria and I do agree with them. The breakfast buffet was actually excellent but pricey (Vegas strip price) and the omelet was a hit with my eggs cooked to perfection. 

Just delicious!

I would definitely eat here again bit if you want to save some money, go to the buffet and 1 - 2 Hours before lunch or dinner starts to avoid paying the full price.

Minus 2 stars for the Dessert section and the layout of the buffet."}
{"text":"I got a great deal on Travelzoo and we ate there on July 10.  The selection was really good and the set up is like a cafeteria.  I enjoyed the food too.  The seafood stew are awesome!"}
{"text":"This Buffett lives up to the reputation of awesome Vegas buffets! I think sometimes the quality of buffet food can be iffy, but at Cravings, everything is hot, fresh, and awesome!!! Really loved the make your own salad bar. Also, the dessert options are ENDLESS!!! (Which dessert fans like me will love!!!) would highly recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast brunch here, totally not worth 62 dollars for two, the food is out dated, and cold. I been here in the pass when it was good  but now those days are gone, will not be coming back. Time to look for a new breakfast buffet that doesn't gouge you."}
{"text":"The food was blan. The shrimp was great. All the other food tasted like cafeteria food. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Good selection of yummy food.  Most of the employees were nice, except for the ones up front that bring you to your table.  The lady that helped us was not friendly.  Overall we had a nice time having brunch here.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great price, nice atmosphere. Many different options for different styles of food. Italian, BBQ, raw, dim sum, pho, sushi, Chinese, meats (prime rib and ham), egg/Omelete bar, salad bar, crepe station, Mexican, Mediterranean, and more. Excellent meats. The prime rib was juicy. The pineapple chicken had a nice kick of spicy. The bbq section was great. The cravings staff provide bottomless complementary mimosas, but they stop serving them after 3 pm. Great gelato!

Here are the limitations. 
The veggie section was seriously lacking - there are more veggies out there than just salad. The cooked vegetable medley was great. I think there were some other cooked veggies in the Chinese section.

There is no bathroom inside. 

The selection of desserts could be better. There were many sugar free desserts. But sometimes, a gal needs more than gelato and one type of cheesecake."}
{"text":"Best buffet on the strip. It was about $25 each person but well worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Cravings Buffet at the Mirage! We got in at 2:30, just in time to grab the last of the Brunch food and then stay until 3pm to get the dinner menu, and all for the brunch price! YAY! 

The presentation at this place is pretty cool. They have fish tanks with fishes swimming around over the raw fish section. LOTS of carving stations and make your own stuff. There is an entire selection just for salad where they will make you any salad you want! There is, of course, all the sections one would expect from a buffet: Chinese, Sushi, Fish, Italian, Mongolian, Rotisserie, Mexican... 

The most interesting thing about this place: the variety of foods. Normally when one sees an Italian section, what does one expect? Pizza, lasagna, generic pasta, right? Well, at Cravings, you get one or two generic buffet items, but then you get two or three very unique items that I have never seen at a buffet before. the Italian section had rack of lamb and garlic parmesan chicken. The Mexican section had fajitas, posole, and even some weird looking sauce / soup thing that I had never heard of before. The Chinese section did not have gross Panda Express food, it had szechuan beef, shrimp fried rice, egg rolls, and a chicken dish authentic to China. How cool is that? 

The dessert selection is enormous and they have two entire shelves of sugar free items for diabetics. Thumbs up! Now I can stuff my face with food and control my blood sugar with sugar free dessert. They also had fruit, mini chocolate and banana cream pies, fresh chocolate chip cookies, and slices of every kind of pie and cake you can imagine. 

I knock off two stars for a couple of reasons. One, it is pricey ($18.95 plus tax for brunch) and two, the unique food selections force you to be adventurous. Sometimes trying new foods is not a good experience. There were a few items on my plate that did not taste good at all, and that sucks when you go to a premium buffet like this one."}
{"text":"Ok at best. Really enjoyed the made to order omelet and later the made to order pasta. My hubby was happy with the free beer...Goose Island IPA and I had the Zinfandel that was yummy. I wouldn't really go back unless we used a BOGO coupon."}
{"text":"I want my $15 bucks back for actually cooked food that's fresh. This was a struggle even though I would have ate anything that someone put in front of my face.....this was pushing it for me, but I didn't have to go far from my room, so that's why I tried it out.....maybe next time I'll venture out to another section for a much better buffet that deserves my hard earned $$$$"}
{"text":"I LOVE buffets, not because I eat a lot, but because I'm indecisive. I like to try a little bit of everything, and Vegas is definitely Shangri-La when it comes to buffets.

Having been here before on previous stays, I decided to try out lunch this time around, but I was less than impressed. 

Highlights: shrimp cocktail, stir fry items, noodles & hot food, cold salads

Lowlights: Dessert selection - no ice cream of any kind, lame! All they had were funky looking pastry type items. Also, snow crab tasted weird...

For $20, I can't really complain given all the options, but I think there are better quality buffets around. The breakfast buffet here was definitely better, so I'd probably stick with that next time."}
{"text":"Great buffet if you go to tickets for tonight kiosk fist and get the \"$2\" 50% off ticket. Helpful hint: if you want crab legs and prime rib but don't want to pay dinner prices then you need to show up at 2:30 ish. They stop serving lunch at 3pm. The prime rib and crab legs come out to the bar after 3pm. Lunch for my husband and I was $11.99 with the $2 discount ticket we purchased for the lunch buffet. Unlimited free beer and wine! White zinfandel, a red and moscato from Liberty creek. Bartenders were very nice. The desserts... Where do I start?! They have an amazing bread pudding and salted caramel mini cupcakes. There's a wide variety of Fruits to choose from. This is an international buffet so there's a huge food selection."}
{"text":"I was really excited about this as I haven't been to a buffet for a long time ( high protein low carb diet) and this was supposed to be a good buffet. Boy either I am a snob or its gone downhill. The selection was huge but it wasn't good . The prime rib was so rare it mooed @ me. Inedible. Most of the food was tough or overcooked and tasteless. I even hated the desert and I love sweet things. Overall a definite pass. There has to be better somewhere."}
{"text":"**2.5 stars**

This is what I expect from a typical Vegas buffett.  Of the three I visited on this trip, this one offered the most variety; however the food was only average at best.  Funny enough, I find most Asian cuisine to be sub-par in most buffetts; however their Asian food was actually decent.  If you drink, then this buffett is for you with unlimited beer and wine.  They offer a huge variety of dessert, but nothing good enough to go back for seconds.  I had a food credit with my room, so it was basically free, but I am not sure I would intentionally return as there are so many buffets in Vegas."}
{"text":"The wait was a few mins,there wasnt that many selection food was not that great, great desserts selection,the only part was great was the servers which cleared the plates off reallyquick. Would not recommened anyone coming here. Paid $60 for 2 people so not worth it!!"}
{"text":"I had to give this place 3 stars because I honestly expected it to be alot better if I'm going to pay $38 for dinner. It was good and I loved the fact that they had delish primerib and steak. They also had king crab legs, but I like mine steamed. These were cold as well as the shrimp.  They had different types of food like Mexican,  Chinese,  Italian. However, I felt each spot had very few options.  Idk I was just a bit dissappointed. I've been to better buffets in Vegas."}
{"text":"Cravings lies somewhere between 3.5 to 4 stars. It's better than Wicked Spoon in my opinion because it serves up food that's actually tasty. They have a self-serve beverage station and I think I'd much rather prefer to help myself to drinks rather than having to wait around for someone to refill mine.

Unfortunately Cravings' shortcoming is their lack of selection. After my second plate, I found myself going back to what I liked the first time. Not all of the stations were attended to and some of the staff behind the different stations weren't exactly rude, but they weren't all that nice either.

If you absolutely need to finish off your meal with sweets, then you should definitely check out their desserts. I'm not a big fan of dessert especially at buffets because they're usually stale. However, I found myself eating macaroons one after another.

You can't really go wrong with Cravings. It's low key and cheap. $23 gets you all the food you can eat plus unlimited beer and wine!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couples times in the past but my last visit has definitely made me a fan of Cravings.    I love the chef's station they have where you can create your own pasta.    Also, the prime rib is really good.  They have a wide variety of food to choose from.  The price is a little on the expensive side but you can save some money if you go to those discount places."}
{"text":"\"Are we really going to do this?\"  LOL...this was my fiance and I at about 1:30PM on Sunday morning (well afternoon I guess, but it felt like morning).

After an incredible \"Vegas style\" Saturday night - all we knew was we were still tired, and still starving from the night before.  We also knew we had to get up eventually.  How were we going to combat this beer hangover?  How about mass quantities of food.

Let me preface by saying - we aren't the buffet types AT ALL.  If we're going to spend money on food, we go for quality over quantity. We'd find it much easier to spend $100 on a sushi dinner, or an amazing Chinese banquet, than a buffet.  But again, my yelp research had led me to Cravings.  Not because it's the best.  Not because it's the cheapest. But because of it's Asian selection.  We knew we were in Vegas.  We knew we needed a ton of food.  But we also knew we needed Asian.  And it needed to be fast.  We were in no condition to wait in a massive line.  And it needed to be on the strip.  What the heck - Cravings it is!

We got to the Mirage at about 2PM, (let me also tell you that the strip anytime on the weekends is a PARKING lot.  We did not take Las Vegas Blvd once while we were there).  We found a spot by the elevators to the Mirage and entered the tropical paradise.  I already began feeling better (it HAS to be the casino air) - and the beautiful gardens really helped brighten the mood.  But this is not a review of the Mirage.

We walked through the gardens and casino, passed the Cirque Du Soleil Revolution Theater and Lounge (looked SOO cool, if only there was more time)...passed Kokomo's Steak House...Passed Japonais...and finally, we made it to  Cravings!  It was seriously like a light shone from above on the restaurant sign.  It was at the end of the casino (really..NOT that far of a walk, just REALLY far when you're still hungover and starved).  The BEST thing EVER was seeing that, there was NO line.  Seriously - none.  I had read horror stories about two hour lines at Bellagio, and wasn't about to have it.  This was perfect for us.

Cost for Sunday brunch with Champagne with tax was only $56.10 for two!  That included bottomless mimosas/champagne and soft drinks/coffee. Okay, that may seem like a lot - but REALLY, when you consider your dining options on the strip - you can either go fast food cheap, and settle for McDonald's or Panda Express, you could go fine dining and pay $100 for lunch, or you could do a buffet - which includes champagne.  We were happy with our decision.

Service was great for us - although, I CAN see where other yelpers may have had issues with this.  We were very lucky - we started off with a subpar server, but during the brunch/dinner shift change, we were replaced with a wonderful server who always kept our glasses full (trust me - my fiance probably consumed 10 iced teas in 20 minutes) and my champagne always full.  Champagne was a nice touch (even though I had complained of a hangover only ten minutes before).

Onto the food.  REALLY - the ONLY reason you should come here is if you like Asian food.  Seriously - I don't think this buffet would appeal to customers who do not like Asian food.  There is a section called \"Noodles\" that serves shumai, steamed pork buns, and potstickers, reminiscent of dim sum.  At that same station you can order beef and meatball pho, wonton noodle soup, and many other varieties of soup and dishes.  And then next to that is a \"chinese\" section that has noodles, rice, congee, and a variety of other Chinese dishes.  And next to that is a Japanese section (with a very small variety of sushi and to be honest, not really good sushi).  But they do have miso soup which is soo soothing.

The pho is good (not the best broth ever) but it does the trick!  The wonton noodle soup was really good, and the congee as well.  We must've loaded up on all of the soups.  The shumai is okay - it just depends on when you go.  It was a bit chewy but when they put out a super fresh batch and it was fine.  

All in all a very pleasant experience.  So much so we went back for dinner the following night.  No champagne - but the same price - $56.10 for two - not bad for dinner!  And the variety was better - singapore noodles, shrimp and veggies.  And their prime rib was amazing.  Seriously soo tender.  

I would highly recommend this buffet if you like Asian food.  And their \"carving\" station is good too.  My fiance sampled the crab legs and said they seemed frozen and salty.  We only stuck to Asian, soups, and meat.  We didn't even hit dessert!

You get what you pay for - and you ARE at a buffet.  I wasn't expecting New York Chinatown or SF Chinatown quality food, but it was a wonderful variety (and yes - there were Asians cooking behind the stations!)  Haha.  If you're looking for a reasonable buffet with NO lines I'd definitely stop here.  Maybe not the quality of desserts or french cuisine as the Bellagio or the Wynn, but not nearly as pricey either!"}
{"text":"Had a buy 1 get 1 here - wine/beer is free.  Food was amazingly great, again, another coke machine but I made ado.  The prime rib was out of this world!  Would def. come back again."}
{"text":"Good buffet. They have your standard crab legs and prime rib. There isn't really anything here that stands out here though. The dessert selections leave alot to be desired."}
{"text":"It's cheap, without a doubt. $25 per person and they serve all day, unlimited beers and wine.
They have King Crab Legs, which are nice. But other food is not too special.
I did expect good dessert, however i only felt good with fruit. But we had credits for the room. So it was fine."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on a Thursday.  We were staying at the Mirage, so I figured we might as well try their buffet at least once.  While it was decent, we probably could have gotten a better breakfast somewhere else for the $18.99 per person we spent at Cravings.

Nice thing was it wasn't crowded.  Only two people ahead of us in line, so we got seated really quickly and off to the buffet we went.  Lots of the traditional offerings, but none of them great.  Bacon was okay, sausage was bad, hash browns pretty tasteless, eggs benedict got points for eggs with yolks that were actually runny, but points off for being otherwise bland.  Breakfast burritos tasted decent, but had been sitting out in the warmer tray way too long.  Ham carving was outstanding the first time - moist and flavorful.  So good I went back for a second piece, which this time was dry, tough, and lacking in taste.  Smoked salmon was pretty good, but with about 20 minutes to go before lunch, they had taken all the bagels away.  Scrambled eggs were disgusting - definitely powdered, and swimming in water.  The lady got an omelet and said it was good, but the line was just too long for me to make an attempt.

Beverage selection was decent, and the coffee was good.  I wasn't sure if beer and wine were included for breakfast, and wondered who would drink at breakfast anyway.  Then I saw someone from the table across from us come back with two beers and announce that they were free.  Immediately, the rest of the party gets up and comes back, each with two beers of their own.  I forgot - this is Vegas!"}
{"text":"READ ME! There is no sneeze guard, the tongs are short enduring you get everyone's germs- they DO NOT bring you drinks, it's self serve. But they will add gratuity. Don't ask what for, idk. They were out of too much- wait for replacement long. Selection poor. You can do better"}
{"text":"Came here on January 2 (a weekday) and was surprised that they were still charging holiday prices for dinner (~$36 + tax/tip), but decided to try it anyway. No line at all @ 8:15 PM.

They have a decent variety of foods and a small selection of unlimited beer & wine (at the bar) included w/ the bill. The atmosphere is bright, and I do appreciate their presentation of the food instead of industrial size metal trays. Drinks are self serve.

PROS:
Their made to order pasta station was a standout of the night (possibly because it was actually hot), but I would ask for a smaller portion so you don't fill up on pasta. A sign with a list of ingredients would be nice so I don't have to shout over the stove to the chef. Also loved the caprese salad.

CONS:
I do not recommend their sushi (rice was hard and dry), but try it for yourself. Food can definitely be served hotter; it was cold by the time I got to my seat. I was in the mood for soup, but had a hard time finding them as they are scattered all over the restaurant. 

Come early for dinner so you don't miss out on any of the foods. Buffet stops seating at 9 PM, but start taking away the food at 9:30 PM. By the time I got to the dessert, all the selections were gone as they were no longer replenishing. Any recommendations for a buffet that opens late??

Our server was attentive and brought us seafood cracking utensils without being asked. 

Overall, was a decent buffet experience. Convenient since we were staying at the Mirage, but otherwise probably would've eaten at a different buffet."}
{"text":"Waste of money. Disgusting. The buffet looks good at first glance and then you quickly come to your senses while chewing. The crab legs were so grumbly that once you cracked them open you couldn't get the pieces off of the meat itself and you're picking it out of your mouth. They have all the food divided into types of cuisine ( Mexican, Italian, Asian). All of the food was a half assed effort at what it should have been. The \"Mexican\" was just warmed up nacho cheese out of a can , tortilla chips and some other nonsense. The \"sushi\" just wasn't. The pizza had no flavor. The salad bar lacked the most basic toppings. The dessert section looked like they robbed a Kroger bakery for its day old goods. The buffet was very expensive ($32 a person) so we thought it would be really good but it turns out that you are paying for the \"free\" alcohol included in the buffet. The seating is old and dark and not comfortable. This buffet was more about quantity than quality. It was a sad ending to our trip."}
{"text":"This buffet is mediocre to say the least. Nothing stood out for me. Only thing I liked was the tiramisu in a chocolate cup, but even that I didn't finish eating. 

Servers however were pretty attentive and fast to clear out dishes and refill drinks as needed. 

There are so many good restaurants in vegas and being a big foodie I can be abit critical but this buffet was just OK for me. On to the next~"}
{"text":"Once again, the bar is the place to be at Cravings, where Tewolde was the latest bartender to provide me with VIP service. He  made sure my glass of Goose IPA never ran dry and engaged me in warm and witty conversation, all the while taking great care of the many thirsty diners who were looking for a tasty beverage.  Thanks, Tewolde -- you're an All Star!"}
{"text":"I loved this buffet I went for breakfast and I really enjoyed it, we only paid $12 for the buffet because we bought a show so it comes with the buffet discount. The wine was really good and everything was fresh. I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I love this Buffet!  Its one of my favorite in Vegas.  The wait is never excruciatingly long like ahem RIO. 

The buffet is spread out nicely and categorizing different genres- which most buffets in Vegas will do such as Asian, Mexican, Italian, Japanese, etc. 

It has everything that I want.  I've had the mimosa brunch with my girls and on a holiday weekend it runs 30 something which is typical. 

Lots of seafood with the crab legs dipped in butter, shrimp cocktail, and the sushi.  The sushi is okay but they have soy wrapping so that's neat. 

I LOVE that they have PHO here!  They have someone behind the counter where you can order that from.  They have dim sum too. 

I love the omelette station because of the many toppings you can put in it. 

The salad section and sandwich section is great too because you can order it and they will prepare it for you. 

The desert is somewhat slim and I settle for the gelato- which they had more cakes and what not. 

You will love this place!"}
{"text":"Definitely not craving this place again....

Staying at the mirage and on a time schedule, this seemed to be our closest option for our breakfast choice this early Saturday morning.

The place is aesthetically pleasing and appeared to be clean and well kept.

 Arrangement of food was organized to aesthetically pleasing visual as well, making the majority of the food items appear quite appetizing, except for a few beat up egg benedicts.

Unfortunalty looks can be deceiving, which apparently it was for the most case with most of the breakfast Items I tried.

I made my first and last round starting at the omelet station. The guy behind the counter took some time to make the omelet, did it a little carelessly however; it ended up being the only decent tasting item I tried.

Most of the sausage links and patties I tried tasted as if it was picked from the bottom of the barrel. I tried some cheesy potatoes like casserole thing that looked better than it tasted.

The dessert items did not look appealing enough to try though,I had a bowl of some oatmeal, fruity dish with milk that was semi sweet and extremely tasty.

The service was nice and the place appeared to be well kept however the food has not enticed me enough to want to give them another shot."}
{"text":"By far, my favorite buffet in Las Vegas.  I really like the Bellagio one, but honestly, I like the fact that Cravings really caters to Asians.  

My first course is always jook porridge with LOTS OF KIMCHI!  They have a variety, but not such an expansive variety.  Hands down, Bellagio has a better dessert selection, but after a whole plate of shrimp, jook, there is no space for dessert anywaz.  They also make a lot of food in front of you like crepes, paninis, and other foods.

Whenever I go to Vegas, I must go to CRAVINGS.......Me LIKEEE!"}
{"text":"Agree with Jeremy A. - this place has great value. Heck, I was happy thinking of the buffet this way:

\"Whoa, $25 is a great deal for all you can eat shrimp cocktail!\"
(And if you just do that, they will probably lose money on you!)

Random thoughts.
- The sushi is pretty lame. It clearly comes out of a machine, gross. The temaki is OK but like all temaki it is 99% rice and 1% fish.
- Delicious prime rib. It is arguably better than the stuff at the Bellagio, which I found to be dry and flavorless. They also have actual (non-creamy) horseradish, which I appreciate deeply.
- GREAT gelato - but the guy was giving everyone the evil eye, I don't know why. I won't hold it against the place.
- And of course, great shrimp cocktail / raw bar :)

I'd love to come back here next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Cravings champagne brunch at the Mirage is definitely one of the best Vegas buffets for quality and value.  Lots of selection and the bottomless champagne make it a great way to spend a Saturday or Sunday morning.  They open at 8 AM and it's a good idea to get there as early as you can.  Great sushi, custom salads, Asian food, ham, omelette's, etc.  There will be something for everyone here and for $26.95 (includes champagne), it's hard to beat the value in Vegas.  Without the champagne, the buffet is $6 cheaper.  This is not the best brunch in town (Bally's Sterling brunch $85 per person), but it's top notch and deserves the 5 stars I'm giving it."}
{"text":"This buffet surprised me.  I wasn't sure what kinds of entrees Cravings would have.  Of course there would be the usual prime rib carving station, shrimp cocktail, and a  a variety of different foods. What I didn't expect was the specific types of ethnic foods that would be available.  Some of the things that stood out to me were: jumbo shrimp cocktail, probably the biggest in any Vegas buffet.  Alaskan king crab legs were also on point.  You can get a fresh salad tossed to order and a sandwich made to order.  They offer an Asian station with wonton noodle soup, you can add roast duck or bbq pork to it.  They also have chicken congee (rice porridge) which was also good.  Both of these items are top grade Chinatown quality.  I was impressed.  The Italian station had some very delicious pasta sauces and the pasta was al dente.  Loved that they offered polentia...yum.  Great buffet, don't think that because Mirage is older that it's not worth checking out.  it still holding it's own against Wynn and Bellagio."}
{"text":"If I could give zero I would. This place is a pure disaster. As a platinum member I deserved to be treated as little better. First off everything is self serve and I mean everything. U want a drink you have to get it yourself. The service sucked. Everyone had an attitude problem. I didn't pay 150$ to get a rude ass reply on why I have to walk a mile to get an ice cube. The food was gross and very cold. Even the cookies were burned and rock hard. As a vegetarian I picked to eat here so everyone can find something to eat. Boy was I wrong. The trays were empty the ones that weren't had no labels on it so you had no idea what you were even eating.  I went to get a slice of pizza cause that's all I could find to eat and to my surprise everything had meat on it. Five pizza all ham...I asked him for plain cheese and his rude ass told me to get what's there. This place is a joke. I will never come here again. Worst service worst buffet worst restaurant. ..just worst everything in the state of Nevada. I'm disgusted."}
{"text":"Las Vegas a city filled with so many options when it comes to entertainment and food. It's not surprising that sometimes the mediocre outnumber the quality; however, if you're lucky enough you can find those diamonds in the rough. Cravings Buffet is luckily one of them. 

WHAT? WHY?!

You might be wondering why I would choose such a poorly rated buffet as a possible diamond in Las Vegas. Well, there are several reasons for this. 

1. If you go to one of those Tix 4 Tonight kiosks you can actually get discounted pricing to eat at this buffet. Now, it might not be a huge discount but for 20% to 30% off on your dining, especially at a buffet, it's a good deal. 

2. Additionally, if you decide to take advantage of the Buffet of Buffets which is the 24 hour buffet pass for any Caesars' owned buffet this is one of those restaurants you'll want to visit.

3. If for nothing else the carving station here has some wonderful meats. I'm talking about tri tip, prime rib, and brisket. These aren't novel in any way compared to what you can find at other buffets but from my experience I noticed that the quality was much higher than many other buffets that you find of this rating and tier. For this reason alone you can sustain yourself and rationalize spending $20-$25 at this buffet.

Conclusion

People will always rave and talk about how wonderful the buffets like Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon are but when you can find true quality in the lower rated buffets, that's when you feel like you found real value. Cravings is one of those buffets found in The Mirage, a beautiful hotel and casino even to this day. Check out the brisket and after a happy meal, thank me later."}
{"text":"We have a 1/2 off marathon special. For $32 for 2 people this was the best value (marthon special rate) and great food. Everything fresh unlike the bellegio experience. Free beer. Great service. 

They also have some tv's although small to watch football. 

Third time here although we're staying at bellegio but each visit had been better than the last."}
{"text":"$58 for two people for the dinner buffet.  A little expensive for what you get.  You do have variety to chose from but I'd rather have less choices and better food. The salad was \"bagged lettuce.\"  Believe me, you could tell.  The pizza was on par with the frozen kind you get at the store. I will say the Prime Rib and Turkey was good.  eh mashed potatoes and gravy. You can get better Chinese food at the Safeway deli counter.   I saw they had carrot cake.  I love carrot cake!  Unfortunately, it was dry and tasteless.  There are these little squares of carrot cake with cream cheese frosting that are very moist and flavorful that you can buy at most gas station mini marts. I got one on our drive home.....waaay better then what Cravings had to offer.   They got the 2nd star for the Service.  Our waitress was quick and attentive."}
{"text":"I was very hesitant to come back to place after my first visit years before when the Mirage buffet had been renovated into this odd place displaying food on a number of miniature screens at the entrance. I was simply unimpressed with the food the first time around, despite all the fancying up they tried to do to the place. 

However, my most recent trip I must say I was either really hungry or the food was really great. Or both...The meal ticket was a bit steep for two, but what buffet isn't nowadays in Vegas. I was just happy that I didn't have to pay extra for shrimp and cocktail sauce. And I was very surprised to see dim sum at 8 pm or so at night, but hey, it was delicious! And most of everything else I had, except for a view pieces of steak that were hecka dry and a hand roll that said there was some kind of fish in it but had nothing but some rice and veggies, it was quite alright. And I was very sad that the bar cost extra...[wipes tear away] Wish there had been more desserts to choose from, I didn't even see cheesecake, cupcakes, or cookies.

Our waitress was great, she cleared dishes and replenished our drinks like a pro. Everyone that knows me knows thats always a plus to my dining experience."}
{"text":"This buffet was ok. The BF and I went to the sunday brunch buffet but didn't know that it came with champagne and didn't get any. I felt so dumb! WTF. I wish someone would have told us :-( The food was sectioned into region and it was all mediocre. The carving station didn't have many options for meat and the italian station didn't have much in the way of pasta... it had some really not good osso buco. The best part was the potstickers. I love potstickers. I'm always disappointed when I go to buffets, and yet I still go to multiple buffets on each vegas trip. I would recommend to everyone (and myself) to go eat at some of the nicer restaurants with the money saved not eating at buffets. Now I just have to remember that on my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"I came here for convenience, not wanting to dine outside of our hotel after just getting in that night,  but save yourself the money, go elsewhere.

The Asian foods section is insulting. Whatever they call sushi sushi is NOT edible. It looks disgusting and made me want to gag.

The dessert section is also bad, nothing to choose from and I have a big sweet tooth!

It gets two stars because I found two decent things to eat, the ossobuco in the Italian section and the Prime Rib. They were actually pretty good, tasty, and tender, but overall everything else is pretty bad...I'm sorry to say this buffet has gone downhill a lot! 

If you want to spent this kind of money ($25/person) try Le Village Buffet inside the Paris, or for a little more ($38) head to the Wynn buffet. Happy buffeting!"}
{"text":"Look like it has variety of food choice but it is not. Choices of dessert are very disappointing. Sushi bars quality ain't that well too. Only good thing is brunch includes champagne!!!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here a number of times and always enjoyed. This most recent visit for a Saturday dinner was very disappointing. Almost everything was mediocre at best. The brisket was almost all fat except thin strips of meat around the edges. 

Even the service was lacking. So much so that for the first time in all our trips we didn't tip. Might have been different if he hadn't walked by the table multiple times and just looked at the dirty plates without removing them.

I don't think we'll be heading back here on our next trip to Vegas. Too many other places with better food and service."}
{"text":"I'm picky and usually only like breakfast at buffets. But the weekday dinner buffet here was good, surprisingly so. Highlights for me were:

Carving station had a very delicious prime rib, and a juicy turkey. Good mashed potatoes.  If you time it right, you can go to a later breakfast and catch the carving station with both breakfast & lunch dinner  meats (eg.  apple wood smoked bacon and ham, then switch to brunch/lunch meats like prime rib). 

The \"Americana\" station had crispy onion rings; pizza was also surprisingly good. 

Husband liked the hot steamed crab legs with all the trimmings. 

For those who want to know, there is an \"Asian\" themed section with soups, stir fries, sushi etc., there's a salad bar, and antipasto type area with cheeses, lunch meat, hummus etc.

The chefs station sautéed in front of you things like shrimp with Alfredo sauce; for breakfast, this becomes an omelette/eggs cooked to order station which is also delicious. 

Pancakes, French toast were great. 

Endless soda, lemonade and sparkling non alcoholic beverage options. 

Beer and wine included for breakfast and lunch. 

Desserts were ok; chocolate chip cookies were great.  Kid liked the frozen yogurt options; there's even a raspberry sorbet choice. 

Would definitely return"}
{"text":"This review is for their champagne brunch only:

Came on a Saturday with our myVegas points redeemed and ready to use!
However, turns out the BOGO coupons were flying everywhere. And once you are in, they give you some more. So if you're going, I'd suggest hanging outside a bit and asking if people have extra coupon.

For $17 a person after coupon, this is a great deal. Unlimited cheap champagne to get the party started along with a ton of food, nothing can go wrong! Our waiter/area table cleaner/champagne refiller was very funny too.

I highly recommend this place especially if you have the coupon. Without it, do not come here."}
{"text":"Stay away from this Buffet. It's the worst one in Vegas food is overcooked and dry. I will never eat there again"}
{"text":"I have to say I don't have much experience with buffets in Vegas, and therefore was thoroughly awed and impressed by the selection of food.  Our group got the Travelzoo deal ($40 for 2 people with wine/beer).  With gratuities and tax, it ended up being ~$26.50 per person.  The ceviche was good, and while I don't remember very many things being amazing, everything I had was yummy.  The hostesses and our waiter were super nice, talkative, and always made sure our drinks were filled.  My only regret was that my tummy is too small to try everything they had to offer :("}
{"text":"Went to eat around 3pm and saw a roach around the shrimp and crab legs area. Won't be returning there again."}
{"text":"4.25 stars.

I really enjoyed this buffet.  There's something for everyone.  I tend to linger around the dim sum area...the dumplings were really good.  I was just in China, so I've become quite the dumpling hoarder!  And the Chinese man making them spoke very little English.
All right, moving on...
So there's salad (which I skipped), sushi and a fish monger area.  A ton of cocktail shrimp and crab legs.  Mexican food, meat carving station, Mediteranean food and of course dessert and gelato.
OMG was I stuffed!  Everything was included in the $24.99 price, except for my bottled water.  That was extra...and you need water when the weather is 111 degrees.  You don't give me my bottled water, off with your head (or .75 of a star in this case)!  I'm being generous because I can't complain about the food or the service.  The dining area/tables may not be upscale, but the food was worth the walk through the casino."}
{"text":"This is such a wonderful buffet I can hardly wait to go back! You know how you take a little of lots of things thinking \"I'll try it and leave it if I don't like it\"? I did that and ate everything! Each dish was seasoned and cooked to perfection! We also purchased the all you can drink option and the champagne was flowing freely. Healthy pours refilled continuously without us having to ask/search for a server. Definitely will go back every time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food! Lots to choose from. We only went for brunch and had a variety of both breakfast and lunch. Free wine and beer was also a plus and you could even get yourself a glass to go! First day in there, the waitress came up and presented us with a 2for1 and she said that whenever you're there to ask and they always have coupons to give away! Good food, higher quality and reasonably priced for Vegas buffets. Will definitely be back on future trips!"}
{"text":"After reading some reviews my fiance and I decided to try it out. We paid the dinner price and was disappointed. :( Where's the crab?! All the food was mediocre and I would rather eat somewhere else. I wouldn't come back here again.."}
{"text":"My problem is that when people complain about paying $20 for a buffet, they expect that the quality of it needs to by like fine dining. My fight is that, don't go to this buffet if you think that. Just go and enjoy the food itself, because it is very good. Believe me, I'm a chef. With beer and wine included in the price, wow. Again don't expect it to be expensive beer or wine. My point is spend more, you get more!!!!! P.S. Love it."}
{"text":"Here during the 4th of July weekend-- get this! I walked out! Staff was not surprised and said they were having some problems that morning. I was given a free refund and a pass to any MGM Mirage Buffet.  Well, I tried it again on the sixth, same problem... Cold food, broken saucing on the eggs benedict, waffles and pancakes that looked and tasted like cardboard. Slow service, and I ordered tea, when coffee was brought I reminded my server I ordered tea, he came back two minutes later with another cup of coffee.  I'd say I've had decent food here over my past few visits, but I think they deserve the yelp one star! The food was gross looking at almost every station! The consensus from people I spoke to about Cravings was you don't Crave breakfast here, but might tolerate lunch and dinner. 

I don't Crave you anymore Cravings! :(

No."}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit. Good food, friendly staff, overall a good experience."}
{"text":"As a LV strip buffet connoisseur, I frequently hit if Cravings due to consistent quality, affordable prices and short lines!

Surprisingly, I do not recall pancakes. What I really loved unexpectantly was I built myself a little cheese platter with crackers. I loved it. I think they were carrying four types of cheese. I dont know what they all were but yummm..."}
{"text":"Food: 2/5.      Price: 3/5.       Service: 3/5.    Ambience: 3/5

Cravings buffet at Mirage disappointed me. They are famous for their 11 international cooking stations, and 150+ self serving soft drinks. The stations includes carvings (prime rib); seafood (crab legs, seafood stew); chef station(fresh cooked pasta); Chinese; Japanese; Mexican; salad bar; cheese bar; dessert. The other 2, American and Latin, were closed today!!!! Each station includes roughly 5-10 dishes, not a lot of selection. Food was sub par, poor quality and slow turnover rate. The prime rib was pretty great, snow crab legs were not bad. Apart from that everything else was quite low quality. Dessert section wasn't fancy, but the bread pudding, creme brûlée, oatmeal raisin cookies were all pretty good. 

If you go to Tix4Tonight, you can buy a $2 discount ticket and get 30% off per person($$20.99). That was around $25 for dinner including tax.

Pricing (includes wine)
Breakfast : $15.99 
Brunch : $20.99 
Dinner : $30.99 
Weekend Champagne brunch : $25.99"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this buffet. They didn't have as wide of a variety as I was hoping for. The food was mediocre and bland. I was the most excited for the crab legs. They were soo small and tasteless and not to mention cold when they were meant to be \"steamed\". The crab legs were the main reason for our visit and it was a big let down. The one pro of this buffet is that it has unlimited wine and select beer which was okay. Other than that I would say everything else was disappointing and probably will not be back"}
{"text":"Nice breakfast for decent price. I had a chance to compare cravings with other buffets and I must say that their breakfast is pretty decent with great selection of fresh food! Also, you can order alcoholic beverages (I know it is breakfast, but you are in Vegas)"}
{"text":"Last minute choice turned out pretty good. Some nice people gave us their two for one coupon so we paid only $20.18 for brunch. The selection was okay for the price.  Dessert was good: vanilla chocolate and mint gelato, selfish!"}
{"text":"We use to love coming to Cravings but after last night no more. I get it was a holiday, however for $35 for lunch I expect my food to be good and hot. It was cold and lukewarm. The food was hit and miss, we were so disappointed. Cravings has changed to self serve beverages. Dessert bar need revamping. Bread pudding is delicious but we had to scrape the bottom of the pan. We waited for a new tray but it never happened, we waited 30 minutes but nothing. Gelato bar is food! We tried to give breakfast a try but it was $35 also, didn't want to make the same mistake. Don't wasted your money go across to the Flamingo, their breakfast Buffet was fabulous for $20."}
{"text":"Those who enjoy the beer & wine that is included seem to overlook this mediocre buffet.  

Prime Rib was chewy.  

Crab legs were skinny ~ half the size they were last year (I have photos).

Desserts were plentiful & scrumptious.  

I no longer consider Cravings to be in the Top 10."}
{"text":"Basic buffet with a decent selection of average food. A small selection of beer and wine is included with the buffet which is a nice perk. We visited for breakfast and lunch ($20 and $25 respectively). Most of the food is in pots with lids you have to remove. This was a bit awkward since you would have to set your plate down, remove the lid, get your food and replace the lid. Not knowing how many other people have handled the lid and where it's been set down. The chairs and furniture are in pretty poor shape and showing their age. All the beverages are self serve leaving the wait staff to pretty much pick up used plates.  Overall a good value for the money but there are many other higher quality buffets out there."}
{"text":"Had a few drinks at one of the bars in the hotel before dinner and before remembering reading reviews about this place and the free drinks. Darn!

The buffet is very nicely set up, in sort of a horseshoe shape with the seating in the middle.  I'm not a huge meat eater but hubs got his fair share and was pretty impressed. 

Nothing sticks out to me as being particularly great about the food, but it was several weeks ago and I'm not real big on buffets.  Free alcohol and good variety of food make Cravings well worth the price."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if I'm so dissatisfied here of their food & service because we've had better the previous night, but one thing I know for sure is that I will definitely not be coming back here to eat in Las Vegas. 
The girls and I while coming here to eat dinner before heading out had to wait in a tremendous line, only to find out that there was nobody even seated in the inside of the restaurant! Then we decided to get out food after being seated, only to be let to another downfall. The food quality was horrible compared to other buffets I've been to. The food was not stirred from the workers, as you can see the old residue from the food just sitting there on the food warmers. Also, the taste of the food was to DRY for my expectations, can't say the same for everyone else. However, the buffet did some with an all inclusive bar which includes wines, champagnes, and mimosas too. The highlight of this buffet for myself would probably be the dessert bar for the food wasn't so great."}
{"text":"Complete waste of time. Save your money, time, and appetite and go to Aria or Bellagio. Their breakfast buffet is so limited it's a waste of money at nearly $20 a head before tip. 80% of their stations are closed until 11 so if you want something other than ihop go elsewhere like aria."}

{"text":"I have been to many buffets at the Las Vegas hotels and I have to say that the one at Mirage is amongst the best for value and array of food. 

We went here for a champagne brunch and they had everything I could imagine. Shrimp cocktail, crablegs, mongolian bbq. Prime rib you name it. 

All the food was good and I had to be carted out of that place in a wheelbarrow. 

But yeah 35 for all the food with all you can drink champagne? For sure the best one I have been to in vegas and I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Not worth the money stay away!! Sorry I've eaten at a lot if buffets in Vegas and this place really disappointed."}
{"text":"Everything I ate here for champagne brunch was excellent, seriously. Usually I leave a lot on my plate at these buffets, but not here. Crab legs were big and I became addicted with that drawn butter. Shrimp were peeled and CLEAN and juicy. Prime rib wasn't dry or chewy, just super yummy. All the food is high quality and there is so much to choose from. We had a few vegetarians and one vegan and all were very satisfied, so that says something. 

I picked this out for a group of 21(!!!) girl friends and we were SO happy; they couldn't stop praising me! Also a huge plus, they sat us all together! Spice Market @ Planet Hollywood split us up between 3 far away tables. Boo.

Go here if you're looking for a mid-range brunch buffet. The end."}
{"text":"We went here because we got a 2 for 1 reward and thank goodness we didn't have to pay full price because it would not have been worth it.  If you eat crab then it would pay off as they did a nice job with the crab legs and pre splitting them etc. The bbq ribs were ok but cold, the fried chicken had an uncooked flour taste to the coating.  The salad bar lacked topping selections, but was fresh.  They did have a nice cheese and meat section with some cubed cheese and sliced salami.  They desserts were somewhat creative, but some were tasteless.  I guess if you drank the unlimited beer and wine makes up for the cold and poor quality of food."}
{"text":"You come here for the unbeatable price ($15 for lunch buffet and unlimited drink wine & beer Mon-Fri) but don't expect the same quality food as Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace.

What I loved at Cravings:
* Bread pudding
* Eggs Benedict 
* Chinese Lo Mein
* Shrimp Cocktail

What to avoid:
* Sushi (hard rice)
* Grilled meats were dry
* They have both cold and heated crab legs but they were OK, kind of bland 
 
Tip:
* Secure discount on tix4tonight.com for 30-50% off."}
{"text":"This buffet had an insane amount of excellent vegan options.  I had asparagus, mushrooms, potatoes, spinach, vegan sushi, several different kinds of salads, cooked onions and peppers, vegetable soup, any fruit I wanted.   $28.99 and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Price is fair, cannot compare with Wynn. Like the chef kitchen's pasta! The shrimp is so so. Draft beer and wine as you want."}
{"text":"Good buffet all around, but is sort of missing something...I just can't put my finger on it yet.  Maybe it was the wait-staff and cooks who all seemed tired...there was no energy in the place.  

Food was okay except that the sushi we ate was disgusting...the sushi rolls were super hard and was probably sitting out there for a several hours.

Cravings was super delicious when they first remodeled and re-opened, but now, they seemed tired, worn and defeated..  Don't give up!"}
{"text":"It has been a year and a buddy brought it up - Apparently, I still have some 'unresolved issues'. 

July of 2016: Mirage Buffet. Our family of eight arrives at the front of the line. We were told there would be an additional fee if we were to be sat at the same table.

We said \"Two tables beside one another would be fine. They wouldn't do it.  We said \"Same section?\"  Nope.  Wanted more money.  It seemed odd as there were so many empty tables around. They sat us in separate sections.

Talked to the Manager on shift and the thing that I came away with is that he had no authority to say 'Yes'.  He could care less and just wanted to get away from me.  Even the waiters and bussers seemed beat down.  There was no pleasure or smiling faces on the staff.  In the future, my money goes to the restaurants that are run by folks that care or at least pretend to. 

When you pay in advance for a brunch, the incentive to perform well is diminished.  So many different options in Las Vegas, this should not be one. 

If you do choose to go, once you have 'left the building' ask yourself if I wasn;t right?"}
{"text":"Cravings Buffet is one of my favorite Las Vegas Strip Buffets. I always make this a Must-Visit, the buffet is shaped like a horseshoe
PRO-Tip - Ask to sit in the back near the bar this will put you in the center and you have quick access food and easy access to refills. They have some alcoholic drinks for free, wine , chardonnay  I was all about the free orange juice, it was delicious!  The cuts of meats are enormous so if you don't want your whole plat covered in meat, make sure to ask for a petite slice.   This is one of the few buffets where I can easily spend an hour just nibbling on cheese and having some breads, you are going to love this buffet if you like choice but don't get too excited about the desserts selection area, it looks nice but selection is low, but they always have the ice creams and bread puddings and warm sweet breads, I'm all about the cheese area , they have a good selection.   

Shout out to the Staff, They Are Excellent & Always Smiling !
Excellent food & service. + You Are In the Mirage which is Absolutely Fabulous, it's a Win-Win-Win"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Cravings.  I have been there several times before and have enjoyed my experience.  With that being said, I gave it 3 stars based on my most recent visit (2/20/10).  I don't know if it was because the last couple of times I went there I was starving or if the food really was good, but compared to my previous visits this time was a bummer.

The buffet is set up with several different stations resembling regions in cuisines.  There's Italian, Rotisserie, Carving, Chinese, Fishmonger (fish), Japanese, soups, salads, sandwich, and desserts.  The Rotisserie, Carving, Chinese, and Japanese are usually good.  

This trip I had Carving, Fish, Chinese and Japanese.  At the Carving station I had Prime Rib w/ Au Jus sauce, mashed potatoes, and herb-roasted potatoes.  At the Fish station I tried the grilled cod.  At the Chinese I tried their various forms of shu mai (w/ shrimp and pork), fried rice, chow mein, and sweet & sour pork.  And at the Japanese station I tried their sushi.  There were some high points and some low points...

+ = prime rib was rare and juicy (the way I like it), the shu mai (especially the shrimp) was excellent, the sweet & sour pork was tender with just the right kick of sweet and sour, the deep fried salmon hand roll was a surprise because of the crunchiness of the deep fried salmon, DESSERT STATION!

- = the fried rice was overcooked, it was hard and bland, the sushi station was kind of pathetic

Bottom Line = Like I said before, I am a fan and will most definitely try this buffet again, however, this most recent trip was not as memorable.  I think the best part of the meal/buffet was the dessert station.  I loved that they serve gelato ice cream.  Very creamy and tasty.  They also had this simple chocolate mousse between pastry layers that was also delish."}
{"text":"Perhaps it was the fact that I didn't have much of an appetite, but the breakfast buffet was nothing spectacular. I did appreciate that they had biscuits and gravy, but all of the Mexican food was way too spicy and that's coming from someone who LOVES spicy food. Kinda cool that they had a build your own omlette station. Overall, decent food but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"BEST BUFFET thus far. I've been to Spice Market at Planet Hollywood, Paradise at Fremont Street, Luxor & Excalibur buffets, MGM & also Harras Hotel Buffet. Again...Mirage has the BEST I've had. I came here with my bf, brother, & his gf. they all say they same thing, as they had MGM & Paradise before. 

I went to every section, from, Latin, Asian, American, etc... Each section, I grabbed AT LEAST one thing from each different culture food. They have lots of desserts too. 

I'm so happy this place is part of myVegas slots. Definitely happy about that, because I can use my points to get buy one, get one free buffet, or if I have enough points, I can get 2 Buffets for FREE here. Worth using my points here to get the BEST buffet. 

When visiting Vegas, especially for the first time, you MUST eat here..."}
{"text":"The Latin and BBQ at Cravings had me sold!  It was REALLY good.  The gelato is also excellent.

I gave this place a four because the service was wonderful and the food pretty good.  There were so many options, a lot of seating, and all you can drink beverages. 

However, I couldn't give Cravings a 5 because the crab is flavorless and the sushi rice was terrible.  It was hard and not so tasty.

Other than that, I had a great time at Cravings!  It was fun eating there and worth a try if you are hungry."}
{"text":"Some of their glasses at the juice station smelled really disgusting inside. I did not check the smell before I got my first glass of cranberry juice, and it just ruined my dinner. I smelled another two of them and moved to the coffee cups for juice. If I wasn't too thirsty because of the salty crab legs I wouldn't have chose to drink anything. Considering the fact that there were no line to enter when I was super hungry, I give it three stars."}
{"text":"The Good: Omelette station, deli section, prime rib.

The Bad: Quality of food that was sitting around was not great.

The Review: I remember going here awhile back and loving my experience. This time I was left very disappointed. The first thing we did after we landed on Sunday morning was eat at this buffet. I loooooove breakfast buffets so I was happy to see we made it in time for the brunch hour. The place wasn't very packed so lines weren't an issue (as they typically are for dinner). My first order of business was to get a nice omelette...it did not disappoint.  The placement of the usual side dishes you'd find with breakfast and the quality did disappoint, however. The hashbrowns were in the Latin section, the bacon was in the carving area. The hasbrowns had no taste, and felt like they've been sitting out for awhile.

Second order of business was to get a nice prime rib, this did not disappoint.

Then I finished my time at the deli section with an assortment of sliced meats, smoked salmon, and cheese and crackers. This was pretty good as well...hmm I started this review at 2 stars, but I think I just talked myself into giving it 3.

Overall I wasn't very impressed and expected a lot more for a $30 buffet, but it wasn't that bad."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst buffet ever and totally lack of customer services. I came here with my family on Christmas Day excited to have a nice meal. We waited a long time and finally got to the cashier and she said we have about 45 mins before they close down. So, thinking we waited all this time for them to say this and was already aggregated @$160.00 for 4 people. We paid and still had to wait another 10 mins for a table. That leaves us with 30 mins ....   Family and I scattered to quickly get our food but there was almost nothing left. There was really nothing good left out to eat. I went to the crab table a few times and they never refilled it with more. It was left with scrap of nothing. They ran out of prime rib too. My Dad spoke with the Manager to let him know that there was not enough time and food left out on the floor. He said if we're not full at the end to let him know. He will give us a discount on the next visit. My daddy was not happy with the poor response from him. Food was all cleared out in 20 mins and manager came to our table treating us like we ate for free. He told us we're closed and told us to take exit and pointed to the way for us to leave. We never once had such an experience of being kicked out like that and the manner of the way he said it . Our Christmas Dinner was ruin and left us all unhappy."}
{"text":"Was okay. Would've liked to have sit closer to the food instead of the drinks. Although I must say I love all the drink machines and the booze that comes WITH the dinner."}
{"text":"I usually skip Buffets in Vegas, as most of them are overrated and not very good.  I was pleasantly surprised by the Mirage's Cravings Buffet.  Ate for brunch and they had very good options for breakfast.  The lunch options were a little light, as we arrived before the lunch stations were fully opened, but we still found more than enough to fill our bellies.  How can you go wrong with french toast and berries, eggs, chilaquiles, yogurts, etc!  

Mini tiramisu was very tasty! Among the best choices from dessert bar.

Service was very good and attentive.  Plus all you can drink beer and house wines.  Great value for your buffet dollars!"}
{"text":"On our 4th trip to Vegas, we went to Mirage buffet. there was a good 20-30 min line to get in. Inside, the dining hall was modern like the rest of mirage. But it looked like a big cafeteria hall, without a lot of decor.

They had good options like contemporary american, bbq, sushi, mexican etc. Not to mention a wide variety of desserts."}
{"text":"This is the only buffet we would eat at during our stay. They had a BOGO deal for our next visit so we came back for lunch the next day. I don't think we picked up anything we didn't like. The prime rib was my must have! Though the ends are a bit dry for my palette, I prefer the middle section where the meat is rare/medium rare. Once they've gotten to that spot, its on like Donkey Kong. I freaking love this buffet. 

The mimosas are out of this world by the way. They have unlimited beer and wine during the weekday but its a mimosa you want, just go pick up some wine and stop by the drink section, you can make mimosas all day or pretty much anything else you can imagine. I personally liked moscato mixed with cranberry."}
{"text":"We used our BOGO breakfast buffet coupon from MyVegas game on Facebook.
$20 and change for the two of us.

While this seems to be a very large buffet, it was lacking in selection.  
There is an omelet station, and my omelet  was delicious.  That's where it ended.
There were hash browns (shaved and barely browned) and no other style of potatoes.  Actually, very little food selections and you get your own drinks.  I think there are servers, but they don't serve you anything.  While I did see workers on the floor, they were not perky or happy.  Occasionally, I did see them clearing a table.  But there were many tables just waiting to be cleared--just full of dishes.  I wouldn't go back to have breakfast here again.  I'm glad we didn't pay full price, because it wouldn't have been worth it.  I wouldn't recommend this buffet to anyone.

But here is a perk--with that price, you get beer and wine --you have to go get it, but it is part of the price.  We didn't have beer or wine in mind with breakfast, but some people may like that :)"}
{"text":"As far as buffets go, this is the better of all of them. Breakfast menu is very diverse. Try the made to order eggs. Very friendly staff. Manager even came around to see how things were T each table.."}
{"text":"Concept of all food stations around in this huge dining room so be prepared to walk off your pounds while eating  in a build in walking path ...
It's my first time here in long time was surprised of the cruise line style decor gold silver big columns and mglass ceiling... 
The uncomfortable chairs and serve yourself  drink stations  do not resemble the elegant Buffett restaurant it used to be. Fun for kids and adults the multi coke stainless stile computerized machine ...back to the future style is an add on for the lots of walking .while dining here. 
That was my first impression , now the food

Very nice presentation ( eyes eating before ...)  great taste and you can experience Italian Chinese Japanese BBQ Mexican sEtc good variety but bad for the gluten free diet but u won't leave hungry if eat salads... Or unlimited drinks (few alcoholic choices too. 

Be ready for the ....It feels the food court authomat atmosphere
Put your jogging shoes and start the track stadium walk"}
{"text":"Food has always been excellent here, Been here lots of times to eat my heart out. I bring friends here and I meet friends here. Great pic up place!"}
{"text":"during our trip to Vegas, we came to the Mirage to see the volcano explosion and decided to stay to try the buffet, luckily.  we were impressed by the freshness and, variety in selection.  as other reviewers noted, the bread pudding is not to be missed!!!
earlier in the same visit, we tried the MGM Grand Buffet and Le Village Buffet in Paris Hotel/Casino, both more expensive and of lesser quality (especially MGM).  our servers were friendly and professional.  
for a Vegas buffet, Carvings is a very good value."}
{"text":"I like Cravings... located @ The Mirage, it's always awesome to prep my appetite for the seafood while staring at some seafood in the aquarium--Muwahahaha... in all seriousness though, beautiful setup at the check-in counter.

Cravings is a good choice when it comes to \"budget\" buffeting! It's probably a good 10-15 bucks cheaper than your Bellagio Buffets (I'm sorry I don't keep track of dough when I'm ballin' it up in Vegas ;)

Anyways, even though the buffet isn't as large as some of the other ones on the strip, it's got your basic fundamentals.

The shrimp, crab and prime rib are all there so that's really all you need!

What really makes this place stand out is the Gelato!!! I literally eat my meal in anticipation of dining on the dessert!!! I go nuts w/ the gelato... I mix it w/ the cookies and other random desserts... nirvana!

And sometimes (often), I'll have a slab of prime rib after cleansing my pallet w/ the sweetness... weird? Kinda.

The decor is decent.. it's got a bunch of LCDs while you're waiting in line.  The ingredients look so fresh and it makes me, oh, so hungry!

What I don't particularly like about the dining area is that it feels too meshed together... you got the buffet lining around the outside of the seating area... which kinda makes seating area efficient but boring... doesn't really scream VEGAS.

Either way, it's a good choice and would get a much higher score anywhere here in SOCAL, but this is the SIN CITY, where amazing buffet/food are a dime a dozen."}
{"text":"Buyer Beware, I have been going to Las Vegas for 15 years, I am not certain what had happened to this buffet, but in my opinion and the 3 others with me, this is by far the worst I have ever had.  The selection was poor, taste was not good, and the price for that was excessive.  ( I have paid over 50.00 per person for better) this buffet was worth about $10 per person IF that.  When we asked to speak to the manager, he let us know he was well aware the food was in poor quality, and that the buffet was lacking.  He said he had been brought on to make improvements.. one would think after such and acknowledgment he would have offered a refund or discount.  He did offer for us to return next year and give it a try again... HUH?  I think not... please, don't go to this buffet.. save your money..."}
{"text":"I tell everybody never to go to this buffet. 
Absolutely horrendous
I had gotten the stomach operation which we had required me to only have liquids and I try to explain that to the cashier
Now I was with a big party
And they all wanted to eat here for some lame disgusting reason
I'm not a buffet person and never have been so I pull out my card that proves that I had had a bariatric surgery it was basically a medical excuse for me to be charged a child's portion
 Either way I couldn't have anything anyway I just wanted to be with my friends

So as the cashier is declining my request she calls a manager and it was this female older lady and I tell her the issue with me and my bariatric surgery so she said that even though I'm only containing liquids that that is still food and I still have to pay the adult price. 
My friends were like that is not cool at all. 
My friends had already paid to get in and were standing there waiting for me so I told them forget it it's not even worth it for me to go in or to eat here it's not a big deal
My friends felt bad and said that they would pay for the adult buffet for me which was almost $30 but I really wasn't interested in it at that point. 
I had eaten here once prior when I took another friend of mine from Florida and my son to see the animals and the dolphins. 
I didn't have a problem the first time I had gone in there
But the way that I was treated by the manager and the girl that worked there I was really disgusted. In fact it was because of that issue that I had that afternoon I never ever tell anyone to go there I always say stay away from the buffet at Mirage. 
When I had eaten there prior there was a basic variety of food there was nothing special about it at all. 
I told them that the Wynn buffet was a lot better and we should've went there so what happened was I went and walked around and found clothing stores and bought shoes and clothes while they ate. 
By the time they were done and came out my one friend Tad had said to me \"it kinda sucked, anyway\"

Trust me if you're going to go do a buffet there are so many others that are so much better but the treatment that day was pretty horrendous. 

I wouldn't be surprised if they implode the Mirage at this point they can't even keep their night clubs together one oak is so gross it was much better as jet. 
The Beatles revolution bar is kind of a joke
And their nightclub is even worse. 
I'm not a fan of this place at all"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with the food... Not one item was great. I enjoyed the Asian section the most, but again, it wasn't great. All other areas were simply bad! Including the sweats area & that's hard given that I love sugar. I was truly disappointed and I feel like I waisted my money and ate things to keep trying to find something good unsuccessfully."}
{"text":"We gave in to Cravings because we had just landed in Vegas and checked into the Mirage and we were starving. I think we paid upwards of $60 for two people which was pretty steep for what we got.

At first glance, Cravings looked pretty promising. We started with the sushi station and quickly found out it was absolutely inedible. So gross, dry and hard. We moved on to the prime rib but they had no rare pieces, so that was a no go as well. The crab legs were ok, and we ended up just filling up on the Mexican station which was decent. Things got a little better towards the end at the dessert station. The Mirage bread pudding is to die for and coffee was good too.

I would not recommend this to a friend because if I wanted to fill up on Mexican, I could spend WAY less than $60."}
{"text":"For twenty bucks, this buffet would have been worth it.  Sure it comes with beer and wine, but they are of the poorest quality.  The food was about as ordinary as any other buffet, nothing special... and they don't even serve your non-alcoholic beverages anymore.  At $29. save your money and try something else."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious food. One of the best buffets on the strip. A definite must try. And comes with house wine or beer. Goose Island IPA nonetheless!  How much better does it get than that???"}
{"text":"One of our favorite buffets.  It's clean and great food selections.  Different stations from Chinese to Mexican to Japanese to Italian.  Go there between 10:30 to 10:45am and pay breakfast price for lunch.  You'll have to wait until 11am, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"My fella and I came here during a weekday for dinner. We had purchased the Travelzoo deal for two buffets with unlimited beer and wine. 

The place was really dead. We came at a very off hour hoping to avoid crowds and we successfully did this. The staff was attentive and friendly and we never had to remind them for refills or to clear our plates. The line is kept very clean, which is a must when I visit buffets. They don't have a lot of selection and it's kind of difficult to find some things since everything is spread our so far apart. They take minimalist design to the max. They only have 4 or five dishes to choose from for each type of food, which is a little bit of a letdown. Buffets should be all about selection and they don't have a lot of choices. 

The food was standard. Nothing amazing, but there were a few standouts. I did enjoy the salad bar. They allow you to pick all the ingredients you want and they mix them for you. That was probably my favorite part of the meal. The desserts were limited as well. I ended up with macaroons. They were very good. Warm and chewy, definitely another highlight of the evening.

I have to note that our beers were overly carbonated and both my fella and I couldn't even finish half of our glasses. It was Bud Light, which was expected, but it was so bubbly it tasted awful. 

For the price, we didn't feel ripped off, but we definitely won't be going out of our way to return. Overall, we had a pleasant experience, but it's not one of the better buffets on the strip by any stretch of the imagination. The food is really two star, but the service bumped it up to three star for me."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this Buffett. 

We came on a Sunday afternoon and got the Champagne brunch. The selections seemed almsot endless and unlike most buffetts the food looked top notch like if you ordered it at a sit down restuarant. 

There are about 20 waitresses running around serving you drinks and they never let your cup stay empty or even partially empty. They are not stingy with the champagne either."}
{"text":"Discount for Nevada residents. I had the breakfast because it's fast. Food just above edible. 
I swore there was benzine in the coffee. 
There's an unlimited booze deal. 
I'd rather have my $16 back"}
{"text":"Very nice buffet. A tad pricey but very reasonable prices for the Strip. Ate here most of the time. Food's pretty good."}
{"text":"The only reason we ate here was because of the two free buffets that came with my hotel reservation.  Decided to go for breakfast as I would wind up resenting spending a dinner meal here when there are so many awesome dining options in a town like Las Vegas.

There are plenty of options but all of them are just OK at best with the lone exceptions being the egg/omlette station where they make your stuff to order and the ham from the carving station.  Everything else was just mass produced, blah food.  Picture over cooked eggs (scrambled, Benedict), bland sausage patties, frozen pizza slices...  

We did experience some excitement during the meal when an old lady in her electric cart plowed over another woman who was walking near our table.  When the other woman went flying, she took out a couple empty chairs and just missed wiping out my son!  Thankfully, she seemed to be ok although an incident report was being filled out as we left."}
{"text":"WHAT. A. STEAL. Every time I visit Vegas I fall more in love with the mgm properties. For the price you can't beat this buffet. SO many options, everything was high quality, and it includes drinks! Say what?! The breakfast burrito was so yummy, the sushi was great, mimosas were higher quality than I'd expect at a buffet, and dessert left me stuffing myself"}
{"text":"First time at Cravings, gotta say I quite disappointed.  The meats were luke warm/cold. The rolls were hard and can anyone tell me how corn can taste stale? From reading the other reviews, I was thinking this was gonna be avg/or a little better.  At $32 per person (3), i feel robbed.  The 2 stars are for one the friendly staff the other because it was pretty clean. (Then again, the food is unimpressive which leads to less customers which in turn means less mess)
My suggestion, not Cravings, I saw an In N Out across the freeway.  For such a beautiful hotel (the Mirage), this is a bad start to the evening.  I hope this doesn't affect my feelings about the show we're going see here later.
I cannot get over how let down I feel.  The Indian Casinos in San Diego are 5 stars in comparison. From decor to size to selections and food (taste in particular) this place doesn't measure up.  I know what happens in Vegas is suppose to stay in Vegas, I got robbed here so I'm telling the web.  I'm a big guy at a buffet and I only had a plate of food, like the serving size my doctor suggests i have 3 times a day, the food was so cold, stale and salty that that one plate is all I had. AT A BUFFET?!? FOR $32! ONE PLATE?? What does it tell you when the only 2nd serving I had was a soft drink? 
To recap my experience at Cravings at the Mirage: selection-Bad, food-bad, staff-friendly&helpful and the place appeared clean. 
Hope your experiences in Vegas are better than this one."}
{"text":"Over the past week my wife and I ate three breakfasts and one dinner at Cravings. Perhaps the single most influential reason for us coming back so many times was Marivell the cashier who we purchased our buffet from. She was so friendly and kind. We had a number of different servers and they all had their unique characteristics but Marivell treated us with respect and kindness. One of the nicest people we interacted with during our stay in Vegas. 

The four stars is because the cost was high. I know it is not the most expensive buffet but it was pricey to say the least. The first breakfast we paid full price which was $41 (ish) before the gratuity. Dinner was almost double that. After that we were able to use myVegas points to purchase 2-for-1 coupons which made the price more reasonable. 

The quality and variety of food was great. So many options and many great tastes. Dinner has even more than breakfast but both have plenty for just about any appetite or desire. Free beer and wine are limitless and included in the price of the buffet. Though I do agree that it is 5 oclock somewhere, I was not up for beer at breakfast though a few others guests were. I did at dinner and also purchased a mixed drink which was made very well. The bartender was nice and much nicer to me since I tipped him rather than demand free beer and grab and dash with it only to return a minute later demanding more still with no tip. That is a gripe on customers not the buffet so I'll leave it at that. 

Good food and pretty spot-on service from the servers and excellent customer service from Marivell."}
{"text":"We had a free buffet pass from playing the MyVegas game on facebook. We decided to gave this buffet a shot. It was a mixed experience, here are their good and bad.

Good:

* The salad station. You mix your bowl and the friendly guy behind the counter will toss your salad. He had all these tricks and it was so fun. The salad tasted great too. Everything were fresh and the raspberry dressing is ohhh yummy.

* Cold shrimps for appetizers are delicious.

* Great selections of Asian food.

* Excellent service.


Bad:

* Cold Crab legs were still frozen. Not good at all.

* Dessert is not their expertise. They are stale and not good. Sweet tomatoes has better cookies than them. Seriously.

Overall, it's a bargain if you have free buffet passes or discount. Paying full price? Go to Wicked Spoon. It will be much better."}
{"text":"Omg!!! Best French toast I have ever had.
The endless champagne, been  and wine is nice too!"}
{"text":"A friend who lived in Vegas for a few years recommended Cravings as your best bang for your buck. Knowing we wanted at least one buffet experience, we decided to give it a go! Brunch buffet with alcohol was around $70 with tax for two people.

We certainly ended up stuffing ourselves. The meats - freshly carved and sausages - were the best part of the buffet. The seafood was fresh but nothing stunning. (There were unlimited crab legs, though!) The breakfast items were ok; I did like the breakfast burrito once I added some guacamole to it. The desserts we tried were good; my favorite was a pistachio mousse bite. (I'm surprised we had room in our stomachs.) Overall, it was a rich meal, though most of that was our own doing, of course.

It was kind of odd, but our bottomless mimosa was constantly filled by our waitress, but the bloody mary had to be filled at the station. Nothing wild about these brunch cocktails, but bottomless is good when you'll be sitting and eating for a long time.

There were lots of bachelor and bachelorette parties here after a night out. Overall, the crowd is great for Vegas people watching.

I'm glad we got to experience a good ol' Vegas buffet, but I wasn't really blown away by this experience. It was truly \"a-ok.\""}
