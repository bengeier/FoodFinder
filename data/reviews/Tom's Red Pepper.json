{"text":"after being on hold for over 5 min, I was told (after taking my order that was close to 30 bucks) that delivery was 30 dollars minimum. When I mentioned that the menu and their webpage said 15 dollars for delivery he told me \"today the delivery is 30 dollars, if you want it order more.\" I hung up the phone. was rude, curt and tried to change the print on their menu that I printed from their site. Will not eat there ever, and I work very close. Their loss. Try Jade Garden, at least they take your order and don't try to screw you because their policy does not fit them that day,"}
{"text":"Food was ready really fast - called in and 10 minutes later I picked it up. Sweet and sour chicken was fantastic and nicely packaged. Sauce was separated in own container so it didn't get soggy."}
{"text":"Live nearby and love Chinese food, especially Szechuan. Chose the Kung Bao as one of their Szechuan entries. Looked in vain for veggies in the dish, and tasted in vain for the hot, numbing flavor that characterize this dish in the more authentic versions. I'm guessing is that they prepared and cooked it according to Western or American tastes, which tend toward sweet rather something with something that fires up your palate. If that's what you want from Szechuan, here's the place."}
{"text":"The egg roll was awful-very greasy. The Kung bao shrimp was unlike any we had ever seen. It was very tasteless. The eggplant with shrimp and pork had a lot of flavor and a large portion. The prices were very high for take out. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"This review is based off of one experience with this place.  I will update when/if I try it again.

Ordered some General Tso's and was disappointed.  The chicken was very tough.  There was too much sauce for my liking.  It didn't come with any vegetables, which I know isn't always standard, but I usually like a little broccoli or stir fry in there.  The rice was fine."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese food in the area and possibly Wisconsin. Kung pao chicken is the best thing you'll put in your mouth ever. Support our local businesses people you will not be sorry. Tom is an amazing guy I try to order at least once a week. Everything on the menu is solid throw some crab Rangoon and some crispy noodles in there to make it even better. Thanks Tom!"}
{"text":"Ordered the kung pao chicken and mongolian beef and both were great- although not really spicy at all. Ingredients were very fresh. 
Do not leave here without ordering the hot and sour soup! SO GOOD and has a decent kick AND only $1.75!"}
{"text":"Terrible. The General Tsao's chicken was clearly a reheated leftover from the prior night. The mystery meat in the BBQ pork dish was indigestible. The only decent item was the crab Rangoon. First and last time ordering from here."}
{"text":"Grabbed a kung pao chicken lunch special from Tom's today.
Better than most of the crappy Chinese fast food places in the Midwest. Imperial Garden is still by far the best in Madison, but that's almost a different category as it's not what I consider the typical Chinese fast food place.
1 star for great prices
1 star for nice portions (lunch special included soup, egg roll and entree)
1 star for friendliness/service
1 star for the food being good (not great, but good)
Will return to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from this place and I was pretty impressed. The food is fairly authentic and the delivery was fast. Tom (the owner) delivered the food himself. He was extremely friendly and courteous. 

I haven't dined in the restaurant, but I will definitely order from here again. Delicious hot Chinese food delivered promptly to your door! Who can argue with that?"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Chinese take out in Madison. It's your typical American style Chinese food, but it's well prepared and very reasonably priced. My husband loves their fish dishes and I love the beef lo mein made spicy. We have also enjoyed their egg rolls and crab rangoons. Toms Red Pepper is the only place we will get Chinese take out anymore. Delivery took over an hour on a Friday night, so now we normally go pick it up. There is almost no seating inside, so i wouldn't suggest eating there."}
{"text":"This place has the best Chinese food in Madison. It is the regular \"Americanized\" Chinese food we all have grown to love just made better. It truly is better tasting. I don't know if they just make it them selves, compared to buying it frozen but it sure is tasty"}
{"text":"My friend is a Hot N Sour Soup fan, he said that the soup, while it's good- it's not really hot n sour.  He did say that there are red pepper that make it hot but that's it.  I had the cashew shrimp and pot stickers(dumplings).  The dumplings are tasty and the sauce has red pepper flakes in it and possibly a little bit of red pepper oil?  I'm not big on super heat, so I was guarded about trying it.  It was very tasty.  The Cashew Shrimp has more veges in it than other restaurants and I LOVE IT!  There were bits of carrots, water chestnuts, greens and nice amount of shrimp to boot!"}
{"text":"I want to rate this place \"Meh. I've experienced better,\" but it definitely deserves more than 2 stars (I don't really agree with the rating system on here all the time). Therefore, this place gets 3 stars, but grudgingly.

The food was fine. There was really not much memorable about it, but it wasn't bad and they delivered it right on time. Prices were very fair, so we'll probably end up ordering delivery from them again."}
{"text":"I have an exchange student staying with me from Japan. She requested Chinese noodles in broth. I came here, and they really did not have anything exactly like it. However, he (Tom?) explained what combination of items would go together to create what she was looking for.

We came home and ate, and she wrote a note asking me if we could return to Red Pepper in order that she might say thank you to Tom. I told her we would write a review instead, so here it is. She loved it!"}
{"text":"One of my top 3 favorite Chinese restaurants in town.  The owners are awesome, and the food is just amazing.  You will not find better hot and sour soup in Madison (If you do, please correct me, I'll accept the challenge :)  

Their Kung Pao chicken is also the best you'll find in town.  Fugu's is also good (they have 2 versions there), as is Orient House's (they use Sichuan Peppercorn!!).  But in my opinion, Tom's still beats both of them flavor wise.  If you like heat, be sure to ask for extra spicy, because they usually tame it down with the heat.  Extra scallions make a nice addition too, YUM.

What I really need to try are some of their more traditional Chinese dishes, such as the Ma-Po Tofu, Spicy Eggplant, and twice cooked pork.  Looks like the there's a chicken dish with sichuan peppercorn too (flower pepper chicken)!

I should also point out that this place is pretty much carryout.  They have 2 tables, but don't necessarily count on getting one.  You'll be lucky if you do."}
{"text":"Great food! Huge, generous portions of flavorful food! Much different from other \"out of the box\" chinese restuarants! 1-liter of Egg Drop Soup for $1.50 that was great. I have never found a better price and honestly, top-tier quality. Be careful though! The Ma Po Tofu is darn spicy!"}
{"text":"So depressed that since the economy in China has been doing so well they took all the really good Chinese restaurants with them by packing them in their George Jetson suitcases or something. 
YOU MUST EAT HERE THIS IS AN ORDER FROM YOUR TASTEBUDS!!!!
The orange beef is mind blowing!!!!! OMG....Eggs rolls that are vegetable are not supposed to taste good and these are awesome!
Wont Ton Soup is not bad but just ok however The Almond Chicken nad the ORANGE BEEF OMG--- Madison do not tell me we have no good Chinese!  The owner also delivers! Wooooooot 
The amount of food you get and the quality for your money is really awesome! 
I cannot wait to try other dishes! There are two small tables if you want to eat in.. The owners are super nice and friendly! 
I have eaten Chinese in Chicago, San Francisco, Las Vegas- Nevada,SAN DIEGO  (lived there for many years in fact) Florida, yep been lots of places this is AWESOME..."}
{"text":"Like another review here, their website says $15 min for delivery. They told me minimum 20 \"for our area\" and had me waiting forever after talking to 3 different people. It may be good but they weren't very nice and the site is misleading. Then they just hung up like they didn't care.

They also don't have Orange Chicken, my personal fav. The food may be good but it wasn't a good experience trying to get delivery."}
{"text":"First time getting take out from this restaurant. Both the dumplings and the chicken tasted like it was on way to being too far past its \"use by\" date. Threw most of it out. The sauce on the General Tso's was too thick and not good."}
{"text":"My hopes were high for this place but they don't have the best Chinese food I have ever eaten.  But they do have good food.  
The restaurant is neat and clean and the people who served me were dressed nicely.  One delivery person looked like he was in uniform.  Nice touch.  They were polite, attentive and pleasant.
The egg rolls were delicious as was the veg fried rice.   The Mongolian Beef and the Orange Beef were good but didn't \"wow\" me.  I personally loved the egg drop soup and the hot sour soup.   Their soups were the best I have ever tasted in Madison.
The sweet sour chicken was just average.
I was really hoping for some over the top flavors in the main entrees and that didn't happen.   Thus I give 4 stars."}
{"text":"By far the best around. Toms egg rolls are fantastic!  I have my favorites... Kung pow chicken, garlic chicken and hot n sour soup! I've tried a lot of places but this is definitely my favorite place to go for this kind of food. I used to visit the Red Pepper  when it was off East Washington and Stoughton Road but I followed them to Middleton. Tom delivers the food himself. I think his involvement is probably why the place is always consistently awesome. This restaurant has a way of being loyal to its customers but what truly brings me back is flavor."}
{"text":"Ok... So a colleague of mine here in Madison had been holding out on me. I travel weekly, so, as a result I'm fortunate to experience many places/choices to eat/dine at. As anyone wood know who travels often, more times than not, it's hard to find a good meal on the road - even with today's social assistance via yelp etc. 

So while he and I were working together this week on a project, his father had called and asked to see if he was interested in joining he and his mother for a birthday dinner at their - get this - \"favorite chinese restaurant\". I was Floored that he and I hadn't discussed this place yet - especially since I've been traveling in to madison once a month for a week for almost a year now, and, because MY FIANCÉE IS FRIGG'en Chinese!!!!  :). 

So, I tried this place Tuesday evening - amazing. What a little nugget y'all have here in Madison. The wonton soup - full of flavor.... Egg role, freshly fried, not microwaved and, and ... The king \"Bao\" chicken - EXCELLENT!  I will definitely be making this a once a week stop during my return trips to badgerville. What a nice surprise - seriously. And not because my better half is Chinese - I just grew up in an area where I had been spoiled with very authentic \"Gwailo\" Chinese cooking. Tom's Red Pepper is the best \"Gwailo\" Chinese food I've ever had on the road - no lie."}
{"text":"Toms is the best Chinese food in middleton/Madison by far. Everything is delicious, and Tom is a great guy as well. Fast and tasty, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Having lived in the San Francisco bay area as well as having been to China several times (where the food is no better than you can get in the Bay Area!) I can say with conviction that great Chinese food does not exist in the Midwest.  That said, Tom's Red Pepper is your best option for Chinese food on the west side of Madison (Soga Shabu-Shabu and Ichiban are probably the best in Madison).  I live 3 minutes away so have never ordered delivery (figure it'll be hotter if I get it myself!) so I can't comment on that.  But when we're in the mood for Chinese food, Tom's is our go-to choice.  The owners are there every time (I think Tom also does most of the deliveries) and are nice, friendly, hardworking people. And yeah, you do get a lot of food for your money, but unlike most Chinese restaurants in Madison you can actually look forward to eating the leftovers."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese in town love the teriyaki tenderloin and chicken husband says the Kung nap four delight is his favorite in town solid apps loses one star for only having 2 little if you want to eat in"}
{"text":"It took us a long time to find a go-to chinese restaurant in Madison, but Tom's is it. We've tried a lot if different things and all of them have been very good (although, I would steer clear of the Kung Pao Shrimp, there are better things on the menu). Also, Tom delivers the food personally and he's very friendly, plus the delivery tends to come faster than they tell you."}
{"text":"I had a desire for greasy, American Chinese food and this place delivered. Thanks Tom. I had no idea that this little gem was sitting on Gammon Road in Middleton. The only complaint I have is that the fried rice was a little salty. The chicken was white, tender and he kept the sauce separate. That is huge! The rangoon were excellent. Its been so long since I have written a good review I am a little at a loss for words. I will say his prices a little high, he thinks he is PF Changs. His food is ten times better but his prices are on par. Oh well, Thanks Tom. I may return."}
{"text":"Having been to this restaurant many times I was always impressed with the food. Taste was good; certain menu options packed some heat.  Tom uses a bit more oil than I would prefer but it is something that I can look past.  

Some of my favorites there are the curry chicken, seafood combination, empress chicken, or the chicken rice soup.  

You can always stop in to place your order then go next door to the nitty gritty for a cold beer before going back to get your takeout.....just a thought."}
