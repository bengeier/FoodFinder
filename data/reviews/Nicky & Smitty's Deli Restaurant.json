{"text":"I looooove this place..best french toast ever, great prices, friendly family owned business:) Never had anything I do not like! Cozy space, memorable time!"}
{"text":"Home cooked meals from a wonderful, husband & wife duo!! Nothing compares to the great quality & prices. It's like Cheers, everyone knows your name & locals hang here daily."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for breakfast or lunch.  If you're a regular, you get the up-most best treatment from Nadia and Melissa.  You get customized treatment based on what you've ordered in the past.  They almost always remember what your last order was and they don't get upset when you change it up. It's a family, \"Hey Darren, Hey Denise\" kind of atmosphere. This goes a long way with me.  Oh yeah, the food is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"In an area with almost every chain and franchised restaurant within a few minutes drive this place stands out.  An extensive menu, excellent service and unbelievable prices make it well worth a visit.  The regulars seem to enjoy it and you will too."}
{"text":"Overpriced! The lady who seats you...I think she is the owner...is not the friendliest. If this is your place smile!! We had 2 adults and 2 kids and our bill was over $50. Two of those meals were kids meals too!! So overpriced for a local family restaurant. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I having breakfast every Saturday and Sunday with my family or friends 
Thank you guys for great food and service"}
{"text":"Our first time back in some time and loved it. I had the Farmers Skillet, and while not quite as large as I thought it would be, it was excellent with a good blend of flavors including the sausage gravy. The homefries are the best I've tasted. My wife's breakfast included sausage links which I sampled and again are some of the best I've had. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"This is a great small place to grab something to eat. The food was delicious and the employees were very friendly. When you first walk in the place looks a lot smaller than it is so don't worry there is more sweating than you initially see."}
{"text":"Small, casual diner. I did a take out order. I got their corned beef sandwich and then you had a choice of sides. I went with their fries. The corned beef was lean. The portions were large and filling. The fries were steak fry style and delicious! Their potato pancakes are a decent size and come as 4 to an order. Definitely homemade!"}
{"text":"My husband surprised me by bringing home Reuben's one night.  It is hard to preserve such a sandwich for the rest of the commute, but this was FANTASTIC by the time it made it to my mouth.  The meat was juicy and flavorful and the bread was soft and perfect.  The fries and pickles were even awesome!  I can't wait to have this again!"}
{"text":"The service was good. The Belgium waffle was great. The bacon tasted \"squirelly\" and made me sick."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a tiny center across from dead Geauga Lake. The setting is nothing special... the food is above average to good. 
They do a nice job with breakfast, and chicken salad is one of my favorites for lunch (No. Miracle Whip DOES NOT go in chicken salad. It's real mayo). The service can be sluggish during the rushiest times."}
{"text":"I'm sad to drop them two stars but we come here about every two weeks or so and we have had consistently crappy service. The food continues to be delicious but when you enter you stand at the door for a while before they seat you. Drink and food orders are also slow to be placed even when it's not busy. One visit here we even had the opportunity to overhear a staff member complaining about her job."}
{"text":"Good food (breakfast) and the pancakes were wonderful. Joe the owner is a nice guy. All I ask is please start offering GRITS."}
{"text":"Nothing to brag about.  Chicken salad dry and tasteless and almost pur√©ed.  Only turkey is Smoked so low salt diets tough luck.  Only beef burgers. The roast beef sandwiches are well done and dry. BLT was ok."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 4/5, This deli has your hometown feel with the small dining room and everyone waving to each other. The owner knew most everyone in there when I went for breakfast. The loudest noise is the coffee spoon stirring the creme and sugar. 
Service: 4/5, With the old, hometown feel comes the no frills, \"make yourself at home,\" \"you have two legs,\" attitude. Exactly what I expected from a hometown deli and tied into the atmosphere. However, my drink didn't run dry, our waitress wasn't pushy, and brought out ketchup, jam, etc without me having to ask. 
Menu: 4/5, Everything you would Egg-spect at a country breakfast joint. Eggs, skillets, omelets, pancakes, biscuits, coffee, and really good toast (that's saying something coming from a biscuit lover). I had the two eggs, bacon, homefries, and toast. Bacon was done but not too crispy, the eggs were perfect over-easy, and the homefries are true country homefries: edges were a crispy, pan-fried edge with a softer center. A little bit of ketchup made this a Midwest dream. 
Overall: 4/5, Best local breakfast and I'll come back just for the homefries!"}
{"text":"Honestly...I don't know what the lady was saying in the last review about a rude cashier or anyone else of that matter, everyone was great.  Met Joe, great guy...had the fish sandwich, absolutely awesome.  Great little stop and eat.  Thanks Joe for the great food and a comfortable down home feeling."}
{"text":"Food is ok but there is a vulgar loud mouth that works in the kitchen.  Not very professional."}
{"text":"Wow, utterly delicious and authentic matzo ball soup and freshly cooked corned beef. Great! food and friendly service. Excellent menu too."}
{"text":"Our town could really use a good breakfast and deli place. Nicky and Smitty's tries, but they're dragged down by a setting that is really not pleasant, cramped and not updated, and the service is slow and most times, comes with a dose of attitude. I recommend sticking with the breakfast items. Get your deli fix at NY Deli in Solon or head to Jacks in University Heights, Corky and Lennie's in Beachwood, or Davis Bakery in Woodmere."}
{"text":"Very good little Deli in Aurora. Staff is super friendly and efficient. The food is very good and reasonable."}
{"text":"We love this place! Delicious every time. I will say sometimes the sandwiches are loaded with meat and sometimes they aren't, but always yummy! Definitely worth the cost. We typically order to go so I can't really comment on waitress attitudes, but we have never encountered a problem. I noticed some reviews spoke about lack of friendliness. We love the Reuben!"}
{"text":"We have been here a handful of times. Food is pretty good, we usually have the Cheesesteak, a Reuben, fries. The kids usually get the Mozzarella Cheese Sticks.  BUT, the service is bad! Waitresses are not friendly and if you have any issues they blame someone else....(example:  Small amount of mold on my Cheesesteak bun, they blamed the \"bread guy that delivered the bread\").  The lady working at the register is always distracted and never smiles. Good grief, smile once in a while( :"}
{"text":"Where are all the charismatic servers? The food here is good, haven't had complaints about that but the service is sub par at best. First visit, our server hardly interacted with us. And today, our second visit, the manager who seated us got our drinks and then nothing happened for a while. We had to flag the bus person down to find out who our server was and he went and got her for us. Both of the women who served us had zero interest in interacting with us at all. The first one had a dry personality, very withheld and introverted; which is fine but if she wants to make money in that profession she should have better social skills. 95% of the job is guest interactions. The second server was friendly but also rarely interacted with us. This restaurant is definitely more of a turn-and-burn style of dining; if you want a great experience with a charismatic and attentive server, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The people there were so rude! The hostess was yelling to the people waiting for a table from the back of the restaurant... Just yelling over everyone eating saying \"how many?!?\" And then motioning them to follow her. You really can't take the extra 30 seconds to greet someone instead of yelling across the whole restaurant?! The woman giving me my carry out I had to tell her about 5 times my 2 sandwich order!!! Not sure how the food is yet but I will NOT be going back to give such rude people my business."}
{"text":"Lets start with the good:

friendly staff
seated right away
good coffee
good pancakes - thin and golden 
good spinach omelette 
asked for extra done hash browns and they were 
Clean and nice decor


Now the bad:

Waited 20+ minutes for our food 
Corned beef hash omelette wasn't edible bc the corned beef was so chewy
Our friendly server got an attitude as soon as we had a problem

All in all not a great experience. We will
Not return"}
{"text":"Love this place! Hole-in-the-wall diner with good filling food. We go so often they know our orders. Omelette, bacon croissant breakfast sandwich, one pancake to share. Always fabulous, never disappoints. Service is not the friendliest but they warm up and are quick and who cares anyway - I want to marry the home fries."}
{"text":"Warm, cozy restaurant thats family owned & it reflects in the food, the service & overall ambiance. The owners truly care about their customers & what they're feeding them & it translates in the product 

Everything I've had has been well prepared from the heart. 

It's like eating at your aunts place who can cook! I would highly recommend the corned beef & potato latkes, those are my 'go to' & I've yet to be disappointed. If you're in the Aurora/Solon/Bainbridge area, you should definitely try this lovely little gem. It's across from the old Geuaga Lake amusement park. 

I would give this a 5 except they just need to update the interior a little bit (newer carpet, brighter paint) but maybe that is their theme. The food & service Rock, which are all that matter to me!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place one morning while I was working in the area and I was very happy I did. I had the homemade corn beef hash and it was delicious. Very fresh and the portion was huge. 

The service was amazing as well with the owner making it a point to talk with my group and really make us feel right at home. I highly recommend this place and I look forward to trying it again."}
{"text":"Best corned beef hash I've ever had! The only reason why I am not giving it five stars is because they do not serve it on Friday night:("}
{"text":"There are very few places to eat Breakfast in Aurora. So you drive by and see 14 SUV's parked outside of what appears to be a tiny restaurant.
Once inside, it is a very tight and compact atmosphere. 
The folks who own it, talk to the people who are regulars, but treat newcomers like strangers. This can feel very uncomfortable.
The Tuna Melt and fries are excellent. The French Toast is fine. Breakfast is nothing special. But lunch is very good. The food comes to the table quickly.
One Saturday night in the Winter, we waited for a long while. Waiting outside is not acceptable in temps below zero. But again, there is no room inside. So be prepared."}
{"text":"My all time favorite family owned restaurant. A place that is close to home, friendly, and knows your name. They have a great menu from breakfast-lunch & dinner deli menu. My favorite is the tuna melt and the Abby melt, my husbands favorite is the Reuben! They have a large kids menu too! The best part is all this great food and it won't break the bank! I highly recommend trying this gem of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Nicki & Smittys Deli, I've heard of them as being a great place for the Friday fish fry and then heard they serve a breakfast all so. My visit was during the breakfast hours of 9am so I should have received everything fresh and on time.
 
The Environment was ok, place was clean in the seating area and appeared to be well stocked. The waitress was very pleasant and had a great personality. I ordered coffee and my friend ordered orange juice. The coffee was luke warm not sure why but I think their bun burner was not heating it properly. The orange juice had a sour taste. I ordered a country omelet with home fries and wheat bread side order or sausage for two of us. My friend ordered pancakes and bacon on the side. The food arrived 17 minutes later, they were not very busy only 3 others in the place.

The wheat bread was terrible, it has some type of butter or margarine spread on I that made it taste like soggy puke. I moved them aside, the home fries had to be the worst ones I have ever eaten, they appeared not to be fresh but instead something they made the day or two before then reheated so bad they were like dried out, hard chip pieces, and sour tasting all so, many of which you could not even put a fork in, and you wouldn't want to either. The omelet wasn't much better,  the omelet itself was plain and the inside of it appeared again of pre made dried out NON fresh pieces or chunks of burnt green peppers and dried up sausage, mushrooms. With a slice of American cheese, the side order of sausage tasted ok but you can tell it was all so re heated because you can see the wrinkles in the casing, and that comes from heating for a very long time or re heating it. My friend's pancakes looked good until you turned them over; they were burnt on the bottom so they placed that part on the bottom so that you could not see that. That was a very poor and disturbing idea.....

After tasting the sour foods made me think they might have a cooling problem in their refrigerator unit or something. Breakfast really is not hard to make and they missed the boat on this, in fact I think they should forget breakfast. They need to make fresh food and taste what they are serving because I have to say a McDonald's breakfast tastes much better than theirs, and that a real shame. I wouldn't recommend them for breakfast at all; if anything they should close their doors for breakfast. The place reminded me of a needed \"bar rescue show\" but for a restaurant.  Need I say more?

Rating I gave them:  1-10     1 being lowest   -  10 being the highest 

Service:  1  - I dropped that service rating down because they tried to hide the burning of the pancakes.

Environment: 6

Cleanliness at booths: 7

Food quality:  1

Food Taste: 1

Price: 4     not worth it 

Would I recommend them:   NO WAY, NEVER
Would I return:   NEVER, not in this lifetime."}
{"text":"My kind of place.

It's the type of place that you can stroll into, relax, grab a bite, and leave happy.  There's nothing pretentious, there's nothing rushed, there's nothing to be disappointed about.  The staff is friendly, the food is good, and there's a good amount a space to be seated.

The word deli means one thing in my book: \"corned beef\".  They've got it, and it's very good.  Slow cooked, non-fatty, and I typically go with the Reuben.  You can get the fries, but the coleslaw is a good option with the corned beef.  I can't comment on breakfast, but I can tell you 90% of the customers were enjoying breakfast past 11am, so it must be something to it.

It's not quite a 5 star, because it doesn't have that WOW factor like Slyman's, it doesn't do anything to knock your socks off, but I'd recommend it if you're looking for a relaxing place to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Went on a Friday in the late afternoon.  The matzo ball soup was pretty good.  The matzo ball itself was slightly bland, but I'm spoiled with the great matzo balls my mom makes.  They have a fish fry special on Fridays and everyone seemed to be ordering it.  It smelled really good.  I got a turkey sandwich.  The turkey was okay.  It had a funny flavor, but it think it was just generic processed turkey and I generally opt for a healthier sandwich turkey.  Overall I would be willing to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"True, it's no Jim's Open Kitchen, but they do make a mean plate of steak and eggs! 

I go here just for that when I'm really feeling the steak and egg breakfast. I will echo other people's comments that the hash browns/home fries (whatever you want to call them) are not the best (often very salty or cooling). And the service occasionally leaves something to be desired. 

But I won't write this place off just yet. Because when it's good, it's really good."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS BREAKFAST SKILLETS!!!

The Ma and Pop feel of the place is so welcoming and cute; it almost feels like you're going back to the good old days in time... when people truly cared and welcomed you and made you feel at home.  The prices are definitely on point and the specials are where it's at!  They aren't messing around with their portion sizes, so it surely is a bang for your buck.  I loved my breakfast skillet with plump freshly cooked eggs and melted cheeses and flavor packed meats, but also dug in on the pancake which was thick and sweet and perfectly complete.

Come try this place!  The sandwiches are awesome too!!!  Give local a try!"}
