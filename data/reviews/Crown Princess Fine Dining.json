{"text":"I headed for the Early Bird special - $3.10 per Dim Sum dish before 11AM if you pay in cash. Fantastic presentation, delicious dishes, and great company...I left happy and satisfied. Everything was so pretty - made for excellent food pr0n :P.

Overall, my impressions of Crown Princess Fine Dining are quite positive. Everything came out with great presentation and very fresh. It's easy to order if you don't have a friend who can speak Cantonese - but I am glad my friend was there to talk to the staff as we had to find out which dishes may have eggs or nuts due to an allergy at the table.

The dining area was very impressive - a banquet-sized dining area (you can rent it for weddings), tables outdoors (although it's getting cold...so I don't think I'll be sitting out there anytime soon), a side dining area, and a couple of private wings.

At $3.10 a dish before 11AM, the value felt good for the calibre of the food. I've been to Bright Pearl in downtown Chinatown, which is also a bit cheaper if you're not concerned about presentation and quality. Given it's location, wonderfully decorated dining areas, and delicious dishes I think it's safe to say that Crown Princess will be around for awhile!

{"text":"This is not your typical dim sum place - this is high end.  Presentation is amazing, atmosphere is really nice, no plastic table clothes and paper napkins here.  But that star of the show - the dim sum - is average. The price is not average though - over $60 for two people and we weren't even full. The menu isn't that big, so we had to go elsewhere to eat afterwards. 

If you're trying to impress your Chinese mother in law, come here. Otherwise, there are better places for less and the food is much better."}
{"text":"Excellent cuisine but pricey!  I've been there for both lunch and dinner now and am pleased with most dishes that were served.  I was particularly impressed by the stir fried scallops and jumbo prawns - never tasted such flavourful scallops at a Chinese restaurant where they tend to be bland.  These are thick cut and tasty.  One bit and I'm sold!  Peking Duck was excellent with lots of wrappers for everyone (there were six of us).  Fresh ingredients in all dishes.  Love it - except for the price.  But in this case, I think you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I love Cantonese cuisine!! My sister told me about this place and I decided to try it out on Sunday night. We were a group of four; we arrived especially early like around 5pm to avoid the crowd. There were maybe 6 to 10 diners who occupied 3 tables when we arrived. 

Positive: 
1) Noise level was very low!
2) For us ambience is very important; therefore we were very pleased throughout the entire dinner. 
3) Use of fresh ingredients mostly and they don't reuse frying oil. 
4) Absolutely no smell of re-fried oil in the entire restaurant.
5) The crispy duck was lean; we did not have to spit out any fat. It was so tasty that we had to order a second serving.

Negative:
1) Hot and sour soup with seafood was bad! It was thick, salty and it tasted like a soup that had been sitting for a long time. 
2) Washroom was a bit smelly! Not expected in a fancy restaurant.
3) Price a little bit high. Our final bill came to $200.85 tip included. 
4) Dishes were not large. Despite that we were not big eaters, we had a total of: 1 soup, 5 dishes (we had 2 orders of yummy crispy duck) 
5) I read many complaints about the service. Although we did not have any unpleasant moments, but perhaps Maitre'D and ladies at the cashier could be more relaxed and be more welcoming to guests? 

* Hot and sour soup with sea food (1/5)
* Saute prawn and dry shrimp with olive leaves (5/5)
* Diced abalone with seafood (3/5)
* 2 Crispy duck (5/5)  
* Braised snow pea leaves with king mushroom (4/5)
* Dessert (5/5)"}
{"text":"Thanks Vivek for saying what I wanted to say... only better since you have the magic skill :)  This place opened in September and it's got Yelper's out in full force.  This owner spent $2m renovating this place.  It is over the top Hong Kong style so don't be offended and he owns 3 other locations in the GTA with similar designs (my upcoming review is Casa Victoria).  I've been here a half dozen times since it opened which is both good and bad.  The manager knows me by face so that's nice but probably because I've spent the family fortune.  The dim sum is definitely top quality but do go early for best value as pointed out by the recent reviews.

I need to qualify my ratings here.  5 stars is for dim sum quality and value but not for dinner.  Dinner quality is 5 stars but value is a 3 and lower as we were over charged on an item when we substituted one of the 8 course meals so make sure you count your items and double check your bill.  Average dinner dish is over $20 and the serving size may still leave you hungry when compared to AYCE sushi places.  I need to make a confession...  I have a  fetish for nice washrooms and this one is worthy for my photo hall of fame.   I apologize if you happen to be sitting on the throne and my flash startled you.

A few pointers for dinner: sweet & sour pork is the best I've ever had.  Don't order the lobster as they claimed the bigger 2 lb size is a better deal for 8 people.  It set us back $60 but it was really 1.5 lb size... one nugget for each person.  I hate to see the $45 lobster which would have been one morsel per person.  We had dinner there twice with a group of 8 (I didn't bring the buffet boys either) and both times the bill ended up over $300... still had room for Cold Stone ice cream after.  Stick to the dim sum."}
{"text":"The peking duck here is AMAZING! The duck was crispy, succulent and just all-around excellent and there were plenty of pancakes. The san choy bau (2nd course that comes with lettuce wraps) was also very delicious and had pine nuts in it!  I was really impressed with the staff, who were extremely friendly, polite, skilled and attentive the entire time. Will definitely be back to try dimsum at this place. Again, highly, highly recommend their peking duck."}
{"text":"Giving three-star bc you could possibly getting good quality of dim sum here, while receiving the worst service ever."}
{"text":"Was just here twice last week and twice the year before.  Food quality is still amazing; you can tell that they care about the ingredients, prep and presentation.  What they've noticeably reduced is staffing levels; where they used to have enough extra staff to keep water glasses full, they're down to bare minimums.  

Some of the best dim sum I've had in the city with one caveat which is that they took some creative liberties with basic dishes I guess to make them fancy.  No carts however, so you cannot order with your eyes."}
{"text":"Crown Princess is very good. The food is elegant, fresh and you can feel the attention paid in every dish. It has a stunning interior with chandeliers hanging from the ceiling and a marble/granite décor. Dim sum was fantastic where creative new items raised the bar for quality. I wish I could say I came for the early bird special..... but I didn't, so bill was a bit pricier - you're looking at about $5 per dish. Service was terrific, where staff anticipates your needs in 1950s formal wear attire.
Overall, Crown Princess left a positive impression on me. Everything came out with great presentation and very fresh. Crown Princess will be around for awhile!"}
{"text":"One of the better and authentic chinese restaurants downtown.  It is pricier, but at least I'm at ease knowing the food is good.  Great to bring your friends who have not tried dim sum before. Bring them here first, then try chinatown (wait, don't go there)."}
{"text":"4 and a half stars really.

Every other review I've ever read about this place was focussed on dim sum...I didn't have dim sum, so I can't comment on that.

However, I was here on the weekend and had a 10 course banquet dinner.  Awesome.  Every dish was great, starting with the Peking Duck (yum!). 

Service was top notch, décor was great and being located at Bay and Bloor made getting there easy.  The entire meal did take about 2 hours, so it's by no means \"fast food\", but that's not always a bad thing in my opinion.

I would have given this 5 stars if not for the price.  It is a little on the pricey side.  However, if you're celebrating a special occasion or if money isn't a concern, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. The food was excellent, waitstaff was friendly and helpful, and the restaurant itself was beautiful. Would definitely go back again. Additionally there is a parking garage a couple blocks away from the restaurant! There is no need to worry about not finding parking."}
{"text":"Go for the early bird special!  Not overly greasy and some unique fillings in the dumplings -leeks and peanuts."}
{"text":"Fancy, clean fresh dim sum. There are no carts rolling around this place. Everything is cooked after ordering, so the dishes are hot & fresh when they hit the table. 

Weekends can be crazy, so call-in a reservation. It can be noisy in here. And yes, the place is super-gaudy and ostentatious, but this is where you go to impress your old aunties and uncles and non-Asian friends, so the bathroom is clean and they won't get scared.

It is pretty family, but there is NO diaper-changing station in the bathroom and the highchair is ghetto. Some poor sap in Chinatown constructed it together with plywood and there is NO lap belt or buckle at all: completely dangerous. You'd think for all that gaudy faux-gold, royal purple velvet seats, that they could at least buy a restaurant-grade highchair for $60! Stop being so cheap, and buy a real and safe highchair before someone's baby falls out of it and sues your restaurant."}
{"text":"I come to this place all the time. They give us a 10% discount which is awesome, but sometimes lately the food and service has been a bit lacking. 

Honestly though one of the best dim sum restaurants downtown - especially if you want a more upscale look (can you say marble, framed in marble, on a MARBLE WALL?). 

Great place to bring out of towners!"}
{"text":"Our group meets and dines monthly at different dim sum restaurants. This place ranked very high with all of us. A \"hidden\" gem, several of us have walked past it many times and, given the unobtrusive sign, never knew it existed. The food was inventive, fresh, and so delicious. The service was good, well-paced - given how busy the place was we never felt rushed. 

Standout items include: duck meat dumpling, turnip cake (which has been a consistent disappointment at every other restaurant) was light and flavourful, spare ribs, octopus tentacles (grilled not fried, were so tasty, not at all chewy). Even the standard rice in lotus leaf had a little extra flavour from the chicken meat inside. For dessert, the salted egg yolk, and the three-piece sesame ball/lotus/almond dainties. The other two desserts were less impressive, but that was a matter of taste.

Try the tall thin pot of soy sauce... they've added something that lets it really bring out the flavour in several of the dishes we tried it with.

Only item one item was not a winner: \"asparagus\" w/enoki mushrooms, an odd soup with flavourless chunks of some root vegetable (orange), no asparagus at all (unless the thin green string wrapping the bland tofu came from an asparagus...?

We came away full and sated paying $21.50/person all in. 

We will certainly be going back!"}
{"text":"The environment is amazing everythings golden the dishes pillars even the celling  
And Cantonese food here's ok"}
{"text":"Good authentic chinese food, usually full of people but prices are a bit high.  It is a fancier chinese restaurant though but I think they spent a bit too much on decor, I rather pay a bit less for the same food :)"}
{"text":"With Dynasty having just closed its doors, Crown Princess is poised to take on dim-sum hungry patrons.

If you've visited the sister (brother?) restaurant, Crown Prince up in North York, then you'll have an idea what to expect, visually, when you step through the doors (both of them). Yes, the trend of over-decorating from the Casa and Crown groups up North of the city has made its inaugural stamp downtown. With marble everywhere and crystal dripping from both chandelier and wall, some might deem it opulent. I find it all a bit... overwrought. (There's a link to a panoramicish view of the space from the blog).

But! There's food to be had, and in a grungy or a gorgeous atmosphere, it all comes down to \"was it good?\" in the end...

Har Gow
Hadn't been expecting anything from this dish, but really, the har gow was probably the best I've had in recent memory. While not particularly punchy on the flavour, I was really impressed by the texture of the skin. And to me, har gow is all about the skin. Hope that they maintain the quality of this item, as I would return to eat good har gow alone.

Char Siu Bao
Like the har gow, char siu bao tends to be a staple order. In general, I don't particularly like these steamed buns, but somehow, they always show up on the table. Often, they're dry or bland, so I was surprised at how good these were. The bun was moist and slightly sweet; the pork filling was both rich and generous. Good stuff.

Chrysanthemum and Lychee jelly
The milk tart and/or egg tart is always on the top of my list, but it was the chrysanthemum jelly with lychee that won my sweet tooth that day. While I prefer this dessert with the crunch of water chestnut, I didn't particularly miss it as I enjoyed the firmness of the jelly with the floral notes of chrysanthemum.

We also had a few other dishes we thought were okay, but not re-orders: tripe with xo sauce, rice roll with shrimp and vegetable, sticky rice in lotus leaf, corn and pumpkin congee, and the aforementioned milk tart. Notably missing from the line up was sui mai... simply because it wasn't really sui mai with the goose liver and caviar. Would have preferred to have had a more traditional presentation of that dish. Will try next time maybe.

I have a couple of peeves at dim sum. In particular, gargantuan dumplings, and teapots that don't pour. Both of which Crown Princess seemed to have side-stepped nicely. They currently have a happy hour where all the non-special dishes are $3.10 before 11am, but please check, as I didn't even try to make it in time. While we don't eat dim sum very often, it's nice to have a solid place to go nearby!

{"text":"This place rocks for Dim Sum.  Excellent quality, and if you go before 11:00 a.m., the value is unbeatable.  My partner and I have been twice, once just on our own, and then several weeks later with our families.  Everyone enjoyed it, and my mother liked it so much, she decided to try it for dinner the next day with us.  

Our favs for dim sum:  

Turnip cake - this is the real deal.  You can actually taste the turnip (a rarity) and it was seasoned perfectly.  My favorite on the menu.  

Vegetarian Dumpling - awesome.  Vegetables remained crunchy despite being steamed.  Not bland as one would expect.  On top of it all, a very interesting Chinese name for this dish.  

Bean Curd Sheet rolls - this dish went fast.  It was so good, we ordered seconds.  Loved how the outside was soft and the insides crunchy.  Just the way it should be.  

Shrimp dumplings - surprisingly good for something so \"normal\".  However, the dumpling skin seemed to be variable as it was a little over cooked the first time we went resulting in slight mushiness.  

Dumpling in soup with scallop and shark fin - OK, so I splurged on this dish.  Felt a little bad about ordering shark fin, but just had to do it once.  It was excellent.  The broth was sweet and there really was scallop and shark fin in the dumpling!  Expensive dish, which I will probably order only once.  

Thousand layer cake - yum yum yum.  An old fashioned favorite (it even says so in the Chinese name) - an excellent finishing touch.  

We had a few very small issues with the food.  I felt the tea was consistently weak, which seemed a little unacceptable to me in a Chinese restaurant.  There was also no true vegetarian option for the steamed rolls, which is a shame.  I am still looking for a restaurant that serves good pure veggie steamed rolls.  

Dinner was also good, but pricey.  I would recommend: (1) the sweet and sour pork for the fact that it was not battered to death and their use of fresh pineapples and grapes, (2) the crab meat and fish maw soup for the crunchy texture of the fish maw and (3) the bean curd sheets with veggies for its clean and fresh taste.  

Service can be spotty with some waiters making the extra effort and some indifferent.  The restaurant also seemed to attract \"Princess\" clientele.  We watched a prima donna customer say some nasty things about the food to one of the waiters, who took it in stride.  I don't know what he was talking about since the food was way above average.  I am definitely going to be back!"}
{"text":"Bad place for Peking duck and dim sum. They give you such a small portion not worth what you're paying for. Dim sum doesn't taste as authentic as the restaurants in Chinatown. This restaurant just looks pretty but other than that the food isn't good at all."}
{"text":"Around 11:30am, my boyfriend and I felt like dim sum, we would have gone somewhere in Markham where there are a few descent dim sum restaurants however we were downtown.  I knew of Crown Princess Fine Dining served dim sum even though pricey I thought this was a good choice.  If they charge a premium for dim sum it must be descent.  I was wrong!  Firstly, I would have appreciated if at least one staff who saw us waiting patiently let us know the host will be back to help us.  This would be considered \"good customer service\" NOPE! Instead most staff made eye contacts with us and went on with chatting with each other and walking around the restaurant doing nothing.  Ignoring customers who are willing to pay a premium for dim sum isn't a good idea.  The host who disappeared, finally reappeared and took us to a corner table.  The dishes and cutlery provided to both of us were filthy!  The table cloth were old and had fresh food stains on them.  The spoons, bowls and plates were oily and the bowl and spoon had food residue!  So disgusting!  Must be poor hand washing or a weak dishwasher!  Had to ask for a clean set of dishes/cutlery.  My new set wasn't an improvement, the bowl again had food residue.  The waiter quickly replaced it.  The food was not very good.  I would not recommend this dim sum restaurant, dim sum items are overpriced and the filthy condition of the cutlery was a turn off.  Find a different dim sum restaurant where they take care of actually cleaning their dishes and cutlery."}
{"text":"Food Poisoning!

We usually go to Chinatown to have dim sum for lunch. But my friend suggested this new dim sum restaurant and we had a try. The ambiance of the restaurant and the \"appearance\" of the dim sum are not bad actually. But the food is lukewarm and tastes below average. I spent over $39 for lunch with my friend and we both got diarrhea few hours later. I would give it no STAR if it's possible!"}
{"text":"Great dim sum. Dinner is really good too. Organized birthday parties there for families. Friendly and well attended staff. Good for bringing guests to dine in style. Considering the quality of food and service, this place is a gem in Toronto."}
{"text":"The food was average but nicely displayed, service was aweful... The waiters and waitresses ignored us 3 times and had no patience explaining the menu! Trust me, if you want the taste, go Chinatown; If you want the environment, go ahead and spend extra here."}
{"text":"10 Course Dinner Was Awful!

We'd been to Crown Princess for dim sum many times and always enjoyed the food.  Based on this we decided to host our newborn's 100 day party here.  

The quality was unbelievably poor.  Some unfortunate highlights:
- Fruit salad with shrimp cocktail= melons/shrimp in mayonnaise.
- BBQ duck roll = minuscule amount of duck topped with a strawberry on top of an orange slice.
- Mixed vegetable = Broccoli (non-chinese variety) and asparagus in thick curry sauce.
- Deep fried whole fish fillets= Deep fried fish bones... I don't know what happened to the fish!

Even more unbelievably... we all left hungry!  Who knew this was possible after a 10 course banquet dinner!

At $600/table, we could've gotten a much better experience at the Pearl Harbourfront downtown, or at any number restaurants uptown... even the Mandarin buffet would have been better.

When I complained about the food, they reimbursed me about $30/table... not nearly enough to make up for this miserable experience."}
{"text":"This isn't plastic tablecloth dim sum, just to get that out of the way.  The room is sumptuous: marble pillars, gilded walls, and crystal chandeliers.  The food is similarly beautiful: the dumplings we ordered had swirls of dye in the skins so that they looked like little flowers in the steamer baskets, and the pork buns we ordered, billed as \"piggy piggy buns\", were fluffy wheat buns shaped like pigs and filled with char sieu.

In fact, the only drawback is the price--while the presentation of the food and the ambience are amazing, the food doesn't really taste any better than the dim sum I've had at cheapie places in Scarborough.  The location is convenient, and the place is huge so there's hardly any wait for a table, but it's more a special occasion place, I think."}
{"text":"Dim sum was tasty, but was not spectacular, service was bad for fine dining.  I thought there's an early bird special, probably outdated pic from yelp.  So I did check with the mgr before I ordered, and she said yes they have the special, so I ordered thinking there's a special flat price for small, medium, and large.  For the total of 6 dishes I ordered, the bill including a 15 percent tip and tax was $40.  This gotta be the most expensive dim sum I have ever eaten lol!  ESP considering I don't have much left over and I didn't order a special kitchen dish like BBQ or fried noodle!  So for slight better in ingredient and taste, I would agree with fellow yelpers that this place is not worth it.  If u have lots of cash and would like the better ingredients and decent taste, then it's probably ok.  Luckily my work is footing the bill, but that means I have $15 left to eat lunch and dinner the rest of today :p"}
{"text":"This review is for the dim sum only. This is by far the best dim sum place in the gta. And i have been to my share. After coming here, their dim sum is the only dim sum i can enjoy anymore."}
{"text":"Best dim sum in Toronto. This place has a lot to offer in terms of selection and quality. The atmosphere and surroundings are very high end. 

Pros:
fine dining dim sum (oxymoron)

cons:
expect to shell out a few $$$

There is a desert bun with red bean filing that is a must eat."}
{"text":"Very expensive for what u get. Food was OK, but no customer service. We had to wait for 40 minutes to get our food. They lost our order; the manager was rude, and wait staff don't speak English. This is not fine dining."}
{"text":"So the team lunches brought me to Crown Princess Fine Dining located just a bit north of the downtown financial district. It's actually part of a chain of upper class dim sum places with one location called Casa-Imperial Fine Chinese Cuisine on Warden and Steeles Avenue and the other one called Crown Prince Fine Dining located at Victoria Park Avenue and McNicoll.

So I've already had the privilege to dine at the other two already and now I'm finally heading to the downtown location to try out their food.

Just like the sister restaurants, the food there is quite good. Since it was the Lunar New Year day, the place was pretty packed and service was booming. I actually didn't have too many items from their dim sum menu, except for a couple of dessert items and instead opted for items from their specialty/dinner menu. I tried their Peking Duck and Spicy Garlic Lobster and they were quite delicious and well done.

Happy Dining!"}
{"text":"We showed up early on Saturday morning and found out there was no line outside. maybe it was because the weather was really cold and windy? We were the second table to be seated in the whole place.
The decor is really funky as it is modeled after old school England/France. With waitresses in french maid outfit? The tea pot and cups are 'Tea Time' style.
Initially the menu was a bit limited? Thought they might have plenty of choices? I chose the usual fare of Shrimp Dumplings (Hargaw) and (Shomai) etc. It is a bit plain but overall fresh. The mango pudding was very nice to finish the meal with."}
{"text":"Food is generally great. Waitress and waiters are attentive EXCEPT the cashier. Went there three times, every time the cashier is having her attitude. Don't know her name, she's in her 50s. (Short girl, Cantonese woman) I asked for the cheque and told her I wanted to pay cash. She yelled and shouted why I didn't tell her earlier. Hello, I asked for check in a far distance to a waiter and no one asked me about the what payment I would use. She literally shouted and yelled (as if I owe her anything) \"WHY didn't you tell me earlier? Cash discount is only for regular customers! ) I had got 10% off every time I come and all regular customers among my group of friends enjoyed that. What attitude is she having? 
I gave her less tips and she sent two waiters and asked me why I paid so less, well - I explained and gave a few bucks more for the nice waiter - listen, if you have a bad customer service, don't ever expect your customers would return despite how good the food is. 

Second and third time I went, she simply did not bother to return the change and said, the change would be the tips. Customers have the right to determine how much we give you, it's not your right to decide how much we give you. Awful lady 

Management should seriously consider laying off this Cantonese woman.

Be ready to be shouted and yelled by the cashier if you don't mind having your day ruined"}
{"text":"The good - they took reservations for dim sum on the weekend.
The so-so - quality of the dim sum was just OK.
The not so good -  service was not super attentive.  We were dining in the overflow room, so that may explain the lack of servers when we needed one.

Took relatives visiting downtown to have dim sum here.  The atmosphere is quite nice, but the overall dining experience did not match up.  The servers who brought the dim sum sometimes would just plop down the dish / basket, without even taking away some of the \"empties\" on the table.  The dim sum quality did not match up to some of the places in Markham / Scarborough.

The main waiter, while clearing the table of some of these empties that were not picked up by the servers, was not careful, and spilled soy sauce on one of us.  While he apologized promptly and brought us wet-towelettes to wipe up, there was no offer to make up for it in any way!  The least he could've offered was to comp the \"tea service\" charge, or perhaps offer a dessert.  
A bit disappointing to smell like soy sauce for the rest of the meal, and just really glad that the clothes that got soy-sauced were machine washable!"}
{"text":"Based on 1) the earlier reviews 2) I love Dim Sum, and 3) the fact that I pass this place everyday I decided to check it out. 

I'm not an expert on Dim Sum but I thought this was pretty good. Based on the advice of others I arrived at the restaurant at 9:30 AM which was pretty good timing. No line ups and a table was available right away. Also took advantage of the 3.10 special before 11 on everything. In the end we got about 13 different dishes. Total per person worked out to 20 bucks total including tax and a good tip. You need to pay in cash if you want the early special.

The food didn't disappoint and the service was excellent. 
Options were typical Dim Sum type of options but they did have a few really cool Pumpkin Dim Sum options that I'd never had before (which did taste amazing). Maybe due to the fall season?

The background music was abit too much but was soon drowned away by the chatter of the packed house by about 10:15. Nice decor. As someone has mentioned Tea was extra but we had about 3 pots and it only came out to about 4 dollars. Ask for water as they don't serve it up front.

I will definately be back. It was a very good experience.

{"text":"Crown Princess is the new high end dim sum kid on the block that opened in mid-September.  It joins the list of places I would take my Canadian friends or out of town guests to try out dim sum for their first time.  The list contains Dynasty up at Bloor and Avenue Road, Lai Wah Hein at the Metropolitan hotel, Lai Toh Hei -it's sister restaurant up on Mount Pleasant and Cha Liu which is at Yonge and Eg.

Crown Princess does offer a discount to those who will wake up and come before 11am but to me, dim sum is a lunch time activity however I paid the price (pardon the pun).  Perhaps I should consider getting off my high horse to get the deal.
Outstanding things on the menu:
Deep fried taro dumplings
Shrimp rice rolls which come with spinach inside it 
Chicken feet- OK folks - don't be grossed out.  I like them and don't usually have the opportunity to eat them and they were de-lish-cious.
Har Gaw
Deep fried Octopus"}
{"text":"Finally - authentic chinese food in downtown Toronto, in a fine-dining atmosphere!

Crown Princess merges Chinese cuisine with Victorian-style (?) decor, complete with cute little Victorian teapots. The female servers dress up in pretty french maid uniforms. While the different elements feel a bit forced together, one gets the feeling of what they were going for - the atmosphere of English high tea, but with a dim sum twist. The environment is overall clean and tidy, no complaints.

Originally from Hong Kong, I feel I can authoritatively say that the food there is authentic Chinese. No matter if you are looking for just dim sum or a traditional Chinese dinner, I would recommend this place to all Chinese cuisine enthusiasts . 

The service is overall pretty good. I went with a large group of friends for  Chinese New Year's Eve dinner last year and despite us taking forever to agree upon which dish to the order, the manager was patient and friendly at all times and joked with us. He was also helpful and knowledgeable. Another time I was there, earlier this summer, their air conditioning system had broken down unfortunately and it was a hot day. The manager was thoughtful and brought us some ice water along with our tea.

While the price lies on the pricey side, I would still say its good value, especially for the quality of food and service. I recommend this place whether you going for a date with your significant other, with a big group of friends, or for family gatherings!"}
{"text":"Fucking slow service,wait for my har gow 1hr to come. We also placed order off the special menu and it didn't come at all. They said they never got it??.... I sent it through man, where did it go?"}
{"text":"This is the best dim sum in the city right now. As someone whose Sunday brunch tradition has always been Dim Sum rather than bacon and eggs, I disagree with anyone who says the food here is no different than the cheaper places in Scarborough, Richmond Hill or Chinatown (not that there is anything wrong with those - I eat at Rol San on Spadina regularly as well).

The Crown Princess is an experience. Favourites include the scallop and shrimp har gow and the vegetable dumplings. They also have a very good renditions of siu mai, curry cuttlefish and the lotus seed paste dessert balls (they are actually assorted, some have almonds and custard). I always find the squid tentacles at this place rubbery, and I don't order them any more. 

I have no doubt my family and I will continue to come back here frequently."}
{"text":"Great dim sum where you'd least expect it - on the Bay street condo corridor and actually at the bottom of a condo building.

When you walk in you'll think it's going to be super expensive because of the purple velvet, marble cladding, chandeliers, and high-end teapots. It's definitely more expensive than a Chinatown hole-in-the-wall, but you can have a filling meal for just over $20/person so it's not over the top.

I don't really have dish recommendations because everything is solid. Don't be afraid to expand your food horizons and order some of the more unusual items. For example, the siu mai is delicious - don't be scared off because it has duck liver and caviar.

Service is prompt and friendly. The space is large so there aren't huge lineups. All tables are family-style, as you'd expect.

I have nothing bad to say about this place. It's now my go-to dim sum in Toronto (especially since I live in the area!)"}
{"text":"Friends raved about Crown Princess for dim sum, and claiming it to be the best in Toronto.  Maybe it was a bad day.  The food was decent, but for a fine dining establishment, I was expecting more than just decent.  It is definitely not better than Pearl Harbourfront, and Dragon Boat in Richmond Hill among others. 

For a higher-end Chinese restaurant, I would expect:

- the tea to be hot vs luke-warm
- the tea to have some tea flavour vs clear brown liquid
- more wait staff; most times, there were none in sight; the dim sum servers were good though
- not have to wait almost 2 hours for 9 dishes of dim sum
- not to walk up to the cashier to use my credit card on their wireless terminal

I don't think I am too demanding.  I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went there very early on weekend for dim sum, quick service, great flavor, a bit pricey.
Parking on the street behind this restaurant is free on weekend mornings.."}
{"text":"The dim sum here is better than what I've had in NYC & HK. It was definitely a unique experience because the decor is more modern than your usual dim sum spot and the servers are dressed in French maid uniforms. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Boston reviewer here.

Things are definitely way different here vs. Boston.  For one, you get to tick off what you want on a sheet.  I like how we do it in the Bean, with the old ladies pushing the carts around.  Adds to the feel.

The decor was over the top if you asked me but I'm sure they were aiming for that classy feel.

The waiters were all dressed in French maid outfits, which was weird.

Food was delicious and prepared well.  Looked like the chef actually spent time plating items vs. splattering the food on a plate.

5 people and 2 under year olds and the tab came up to 175 after tip.  A bit pricey ifyou ask me =/"}
{"text":"Okay, so we still like the dim sum at Crown Princess, and we're still having our wedding reception there, but we discovered this week to our great dismay that: 
THERE IS NO MORE DIM SUM DISCOUNT BEFORE 11AM !!

There was no sign or any mention from the wait staff that the special had been discounted, so we only found out  when we got our bill. It was, shall we say, an unpleasant surprise. My friend put up a real fuss, explaining to the manager that we were going to be spending many thousands of dollars there for the wedding, and that they should have posted a sign or notice to alert prior customers of the elimination of the special. Eventually he persuaded the manager to give us a 10% discount if we paid cash, but  the whole process was terribly awkward and uncomfortable. We tipped minimally but it still came to $23 per person for the 5 of us. 

Of course $25 a person (if one tips properly) is not an outrageous price for tasty dim sum in a luxurious setting with attentive service, but it's definitely not the amazing deal we've all been raving about here on Yelp. What I'm hoping is that Crown Princess will come up with a compromise -- revive the pre 11am special, but just on weekdays. That way those of us on a budget with flexible schedules can keep their tables full during off-peak hours, while they can still turn a big profit during peak hours. Otherwise, if you're on a budget and content to have tasty dim sum without the elegant ambiance, you're better off at Rol San."}
{"text":"Not a fan of be gaudy decor. The food is so and so at such a high price point. However, the location is great if you don't want to trek all the way to Chinatown ."}
{"text":"oooopppps

Made the mistake of thinking that I would be able to have dim sum for dinner here - not the case, dim sum ends at 4 or 5. O well, I'll just have to go back again.

1) I like that the space is divided so families can have there own space without disturbing smaller groups.

2) Nice decor - it is a little sparkly and may have a rather surprising number of chandeliers, but really this felt like a nice way to bridge expectations of high-end decor.

3) bring a group - eat family-style, try many different things and for those of us still experimenting with Chinese cuisine you'll have an adventure :)

4) the service was very attentive, perhaps because the main dinning room was quiet on a Saturday night - not sure this would be the case during the day when dim sum is available (will report back on this).

5) HUGE dinner menu - this isn't actually surprising, but if you are looking for delicacies or \"standard fair\" you can find it here. Our server was good at giving us some direction about what to combine since we didn't feel like going for one of the set menus

6) Everything seemed fresh - the vegetables were nice and crisp, the meat was nicely cooked.

7) The servings were generous - for four people we started with soup (a variety available) and then order two meat dishes, a mixed vegetable, and a fried rice for those a little intimidated. We kept things on the low end of the price scale, so the main dishes were on average $20.

8) Enjoyed the complementary red-bean cookies for dessert"}
{"text":"Did Elton John decorate this place? Anyways the dim sum here is decent but not amazing. The place is clean and the staff is courteous, but you are paying for that since dim sum here is about twice the price you would pay in a chinatown dim sum joint. Because they take reservations which a lot of dim sum restaurants don't,  I mainly come here with family or when I really don't feel like waiting for dim sum on weekends during brunch hours."}
{"text":"I have been here before for dim sum which was great and was expecting a similar experience for dinner. I could never be more wrong. This turned out to be a 2 hour ordeal of which I was ready to just up and leave.

Our first waiter couldn't speak any English and mysteriously disappeared after a question about one of the dishes. Our second waiter came and took our order no problem. Then began the wait. Many people came in after us, had their order taken, received their food AND finished eating before we even got our appetizer.

Going by number of tables occupied, it seemed to be at 30% capacity so this was definitely not a case of the kitchen being swamped. It should not take 2 hours to make 2 appetizers and 2 entrees.

While waiting for our food we noticed a person came in and asked about the food they have. While he obviously came looking for \"Americanized\" Chinese food, there was no need for staff talk so condescending and rudely to him. After he left, they made disparaging comments about his intelligence and race.

No concessions or genuine apology was made of this terrible experience so I can't say I will be back."}
{"text":"It is expensive DimSum, but SO lovely!

Besides the fact that you get white linen service and fine china, the dim sum is really really pretty and high quality. Not at all heavy or greasy, and you are not left feeling weighted down afterwards.  The Hargow is good, and the  mushroom dumplings. Even though I continue to order it , the octopus here is not great. Very chewy. 

Be wary of the \"daily specials\" I went  for lunch with a party of 5 and we had Groupons on that occasion. The staff were aware and were (I suspect) trying to upsell us. In the end, they suggested this scallop with X.O. special that was apparently amazing. It was fine and all, but at $11 a head, increased the bill by $55. For a single scallop I would have never paid that much if I knew. 

Really yummy dim sum though. If it was cheaper... WOW."}
{"text":"4 stars for their dim sum (especially if you can get there before 11am for the special discount!) - I whistle the same dim-sum-happy tune as the rest of my fellow reviewers: a great, refined dim sum twist for us downtowners with unique dishes, quality food, and fancy-schmancy dishes. 

Reservations are not accepted before 11am, though if you can drag yourself out of bed early enough, you can generally be seated without a wait if you are there before 10am. 

The traditional fare is worth ordering - har gow, rice rolls, fried octopus (which is in fact what I suspect is squid, and note - not battered). However, it's worth adventuring into their more distinctive dishes, like the pumpkin congee or layered cake dessert. 

We also tried the place for dinner, which is not nearly as busy as it is during dim sum hours. The prices are quite high, and while the manager is happy to deliver quality service and recommendations, I have yet to be convinced that the price delivers. Dinner food is good, but not necessarily better than other joints that offer similar fare for half the price (and the fresh scallops were undercooked). For that experience, a wavering 2 stars.

But who cares!?!?! 

Dim sum!!"}
{"text":"Wow, though it's been said a number of times here already, the decor in this place is immaculate.  Vivek S. really called it, I felt a little out of place in here with my cargo shorts and t-shirt.  Thankfully most of the clientele were dressed similarly.   Compared with Cha Lau on Yonge, I found this place is clearly the best moderate-to-high priced dim sum in the area; the portions are larger, the quality is at least as good (though perhaps better), and the service left nothing to be desired (again though, $3 for a pot of tea? come on guys, I've got a tea addict for a wife, quit nickel and diming me).

I highly recommend:
- Steamed scallop/shrimp dumplings (there were actual pieces of scallop in there, you didn't have to debate whether there was some sort of simulated scallop replacement or not - and the presentation was very nice)
- Har gow (which had large shrimp, not just a finely chopped amalgam of shrimp), 
- Crystal duck dumplings 
- BBQ pork buns (some of the best I've ever had for sure).  

Just so you know how the pricing breaks down:

S = 3.10
M = 4.30
L = 5.30
XL = 6.30

Not sure why they don't come out and say that, I hate being left to guess how much I've just spent.  Fortunately, with tax and tip, our meal came to $45, so I was presently surprised (given the experience at Cha Lau).  Expensive for breakfast, decent for brunch and hands down the best dim sum deal (quality/quantity/price) I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"I dined at Crown Princess last month as part of an epic 'five dinners in seven hours' food safari around Toronto.
According to my dear friend Robin, this place serves one of the city's best versions of hot and sour soup.
If you've never step foot in this restaurant, you're in for a shock because it boasts garish interiors. In fact, it honestly looks like a room that Donald Trump would design if he were given free rein over the interior decorating process.
A feature wall with a diamond stitched pattern complete with cubic zirconias on purple velvet dominates the room on the right, while gigantic marble wall panels pervade on the left. The space in between is equally as loud too. Intricate chandeliers hang from above and the floor is covered in a vulgar, royal blue patterned carpet.
Turned off by the gaudy interiors, we decide to order just one dish - the seafood hot and sour soup.
When the dish arrives, I immediately spot plating splatters around the rim. Clearly, presentation isn't the restaurant's strong point. Nevertheless, the paint-thick broth is a bright, fiery orange color and features chunks of egg, shrimp, crab meat, scallops and brunoised tofu.
Although the seafood tastes like it's come straight from the frozen cabinet at Whole Foods, the seasoning is spot-on.
The kitchen manages to strike a nice balance between hot and sour and there's even a surprise kick towards the end which is reminiscent of Tabasco sauce.
The dish is a tad monochromatic and could have done with a splash of another hue - an injection of green with scallions, perhaps - but it is a solid version of the Chinese soup.

{"text":"My family and I made reservations for Chinese New Year's dinner. Here's what happened:

-They took about 20 minutes to take our order.
-First we ordered two orders of veg spring rolls. The waiter said they didn't have veg spring rolls. Not that they were out of them, that they don't have them period. It's the first thing on the menu.
-We wanted to order Peking Duck. They didn't have any left.
-We waited an hour for our food. It didn't come, so we left.
-They didn't even serve us the spring rolls and provide some nibbles to compensate us for having to wait so long.
-The spring rolls were actually served to another table.

It'd been a long time since we went here, so I forgot how bad the service was. Yes it was Chinese New Year and they were busy, but we were just forgotten about and the servers were pretty dumb (saying they didn't have veg spring rolls and then serving it to another table).

We are never coming back here again.

To sum up: awful decor, terrible service, overpriced meh food. If you do decide to eat here, don't do it on Chinese New Year and expect to pay a lot for bad service."}
{"text":"Wow what an amazing atmosphere!

Marble columns, chandeliers, china tea pots,  tablecloths, uniformed staff, 14ft doors, sky high ceiling the whole 9 yards dining in pure opulence.  Main room is the nicest IMHO

The food is presented nicely and is excellent in preparation. There offer some original fusion items such as the foie gras and caviar siu mai

I don't find anything truly OMG though but the food is solid and service is spot on.  

Left $65 lighter for dim sum for two. Yeah we ordered a lot. Don't want to divulge in all the details *oink* *oink* *wink*  *wink*"}
{"text":"Immediately noticed on the menu that they serve shark fin. For ethical reasons we got up and left without ordering. How a restaurant can continue to serve shark fin is beyond me and I urge everyone to think about whether or not they wish to patronize an establishment that supports such a disgraceful, barbaric and unsustainable practice."}
{"text":"Love the environment. So clean and fancy; creates a certain atmosphere you can't find at other dim sum places. Service was spot on (again not your usual dim sum experience).

Food was quite nice, although could be better. You can tell that the restaurant has lost _some_ authenticity with certain dishes but overall still a solid place to go for dim sum."}
{"text":"I've been to this place almost a year ago and it tasted fine. However when I went today, the food honestly tasted like shit or plastic. Everything tastes so shitty and plasticy, I can't even force myself to finish the meal. No word can describe how disgusting the dishes are. Terrible experience. SAD."}
{"text":"We heard some mixed reviews about this new place but we decided to see for ourselves.  Usually we go for dim sum at Rol San in chinatown but this restaurant is walking distance from home.

What we ordered:

Har Gow ($5.30) - 4 Large pieces.  Shrimp had a hint of ginger, perhaps?They didn't wow us although they were fresh and came out steaming hot, which is a must.  

Scallop Dumpling ($5.30) - 3 Large pieces.  Dumplings were filled with scallop and shrimp, very delicate and tasty.  Much better than the Har Gow.

Vegetable Pork Dumpling ($4.30) - 4 Medium Pieces.  This one was our favorite.  Filled with minced pork, chives, water chestnut and peanut.  Very different from anything we ever had.  Beautifully seasoned and loved the crunchy texture from the water chestnut and peanut.

Pan Fried Turnip Cake ($4.30) - 4 Pieces.  We probably won't order this again, usually bacon makes everything good but in this case it was still kinda blah.

BBQ Pork Pastry ($5.30) - 3 Pieces.  Pastry was quite lovely and not mushy.  There wasn't a lot of BBQ Pork inside the pastry.  

FYI - Think twice before requesting another tea, it's not complimentary.

Crown Princess is a nice restaurant.  The decor is a bit over the top, in my opinion.  Beautiful washroom.  It is huge inside, with different dining rooms, amenable for large gatherings.  Would be good for a business lunch or a special occasion.

Service was excellent.  Floor staff were very attentive and polite."}
{"text":"I love a good dim sum brunch. And finding delicious and innovative dim sum in the confines of central Toronto was something I had been trying to get to. When my friend suggested Crown Princess instead of my go to suggestion, Pearl Harbourfront, I was all for it. And Crown Princess was pretty spot on. You can tell a good restaurant by how they treat the staple foods. The har gow and Siu Mai here tasted of fresh ingredients.  And what a delightful difference to use foie gras instead of tobiko.  The har gow was not greasy as sometimes it tends to get if sitting in the steamer too long.  The siu mai was crisp in the mouth as each morsel was devoured and the pork was tender and not mushy as some restaurants can be, again if it sits in the steamer too long.  

Between me and my friend, we ordered 8 dishes.  
Har Gow
Siu Main
Deep fried Octopus
Crispy Taro and mushroom paste
Sirloin beef wrapped in rice noodles (this I would skip next time as it was rather mushy)
Beef meatball on bed of enoki mushroom
Shrimp Rolls
Egg tart
Which is a lot for two people.  But we devoured it all.

The decor is nice, a little ostentatious but with a name like Crown Princess I guess they cater to the ostentatious.  It also doesn't seem like the price of the dim sum discourages young, old nor families because all of them were present at this downtown establishment.  I will definitely bring my family here next time and try all of the other dishes.  Lots to choose from and this restaurant certainly doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Came here today for a lunch meeting and had an interesting mix of dimsum and dishes from the menu.  Service was much better than I had expected and the food was pretty good as well.  For dimsum we had the chicken feet and durian pastry.  Not a big fan of durian but everyone else on the table enjoyed it.  Chicken feet was meaty and tasty.  We had several dishes from the menu.  The lobster noodles was really good but the best dish was the roast duck.  Skin is crispy and meat was tender.  
Will come back again."}
{"text":"Holy shit, this place has amazing dim sum. It is very upscale, everything about it screams class. But hey, it delivers. The bird's nest egg tarts are great. Anything shrimp is amazing and so fresh. If you enjoy dim sum, you got to hit this place up. The price is well worth it."}
{"text":"Fav dim sum place in the city. We come here when my wife has the cravings. Prices are fair for the quality of food. Place is on the fancy side but no dress code required. Service is satisfactory. Typical unhappy waiters/waitresses in any Chinese restaurant, though I have to point out there was one waitress who was always smiling. Get a number when you first arrive and be sure to listen carefully for your number. Hostess calls out twice and will skip you in a heartbeat. Enjoy the food"}
{"text":"4th time finding glass, plastic wrapping, or pebbles in my har gow or congee.  And the most they ever offer as a accommodation is some egg tarts or they take it off the  bill without replacing the old one. If you find  glass or something that can potentially harm you in your food you would think the restaurant would try to make up for it and pay for your bill. But to my knowledge they have not done any of that. The lady that looks like shes in her late 40s is probably one  of the worst severs I have ever encountered. As we were paying for the bill she tried calculating the amount of tip she was supposed  to get.  We all paid the same amount  with the exact tip of 15 percent but she made a blunder and calculated  it wrong.  She literally told everyone  at the table the amount has to be 10 percent. It was astonishing as to how shameless a person can be. Not only do we not have to tip her but whats worse is she made it seem like its required to do so.  After we told her that she calculated  the amount wrong and that we indeed paid more then 10 percent, she did not apologize.  I would  recommend not coming to this  place.  Although  it may look nice and the servers may look professional they are only in it for the profit,  and not diligently trying to satisfy their customers."}

Who doesn't want to check out a restaurant called Crown Princess? When I first heard about this restaurant, I thought it was a joke...I just couldn't picture a Dim Sum spot called Crown Princess. Well it did exist and I was there for some Dim Sum on a Sunday with my family and friends.

I've been to many fancy chinese restaurants back in Vancouver where there is plenty, but I've never been to one this fancy. And I don't mean fancy as in sophisticated...chic...interior decor- I mean it as in over the top sort of tacky fancy. They have chandliers and high ceilings with high tea sets...as well as servers dressed in maid outfits.

Anyways, the restaurant is super clean and the servers were extremely polite which I liked. There were a lot of us at the restaurant so we decided to go crazy with the Dim Sum ordering as well as some Peking duck (for lunch, I know).

Ordered: Roasted Peking Duck

* $52 for 2 course Peking Duck
* They actually had someone stand behind our table and skin the roasted duck
* She was very well skilled and did it in only few minutes
* My favorite part of the 2 course of Peking duck is the skin + wrap + green onion + hoisin sauce
* I always use up all of the green onions so I ask for more

Ordered: Shark Fin Seafood Dumpling in Soup (#1) 

* I don't particularly enjoy Shark Fin soup but decided to order it cause of the controversy
* The fact that I wouldn't be able to order it anymore crave it
* Soup was clear and quite refreshing
* You break open the dumpling and eat it with the soup
* Decent amount of sharks fin in the soup

Ordered: Shrimp Dumpling (#2:Har Gow)

* How many times do I have to talk about Har Gow on my blog?
* Dumpling skin was too thick and sticky
* I wouldn't order this again 

Ordered: Steamed Scallop & Shrimp Dumpling (#4)

* I didn't get to taste this but my sister told me it tasted exactly same as the Har Gow

Ordered: Sticky Rice with Meat Wrap in Lotus Leaf (#7)

* I didn't have any of this since by the time it came out, I was already full

Ordered: Chicken feet with Chef's Sauce (#8)

* I always prefer red sauce over brown sauce for chicken feet
* Sauce was perfect but it was a tad bit over-cooked
* Chicken feet was falling apart even before I picked it up

Ordered: Beef Tripe with XO Sauce (#12)

* This was a little too bland
* I was looking to order a tendon dish which they didn't have..so I settled with this
* I wouldn't order this again

Ordered: Spare Rib with Black Bean Sauce (#15)

* Spare rib pieces were way too small, they were almost chopped up
* It wasn't very hot when it arrived at the table 
* Because it had cooled down, the sauce seemed too oily for me

Ordered: Steamed Baby Squid in Curry Sauce (#20)

* Squid was actually too big to be made into this dish
* Because it was big, it didn't soak up enough of the curry sauce and the meat was tough
* This was really difficult to eat and the curry sauce was not strong enough

Ordered: Fried Octopus Tentacles (#24)

* I liked this because it wasn't covered in batter like every other place
* It was different and less oily which I enjoyed
* But it did lack crispiness for deep fried item
* I would order this again

ordered: Pan Fried Beef Ribs w/ Maggie Sauce (#26)

* 4~5 pieces of spare ribs covered in black bean sauce for 
* This was a little too fatty and salty to be eaten by itself
* It would be better if eaten with rice

Ordered: Crispy Jumbo Shrimp with Mayo Sauce (#28)

* I've never seen this served like this
* It was actually quite ginormous and hard to eat
* It was filled with shrimp inside and was served piping hot
* Deep fried and shrimp with mayo sauce? You can't really go wrong with this this

Ordered: Baked BBQ Pork Puff Pastry (#36)

* I personally don't like this dish because I find it to be too dry
* This is one of my sister's favorite dish

Ordered: Pan-fried Snowpea Leaves (#56)

Ordered: Deep fried Wonton with Sour Sauce (#57)

* This dish was a big joke
* I thought it would be real wontons with fillings
* This was basically a bowl of sweet & sour sauce and deep fried dumpling skin
* There was too much sauce I didn't even know what to do with it
* Sauce had some seafood in it but since it was drenched in sweet & sour sauce, it wasn't very tasty
* Would not order again!

Summary: Love the location and service, but food was mediocre and not worth the extra dollar or two per dish. If you are bringing someone that's new to dimsum or wanted a clean bright environment for fancier dimsum- this is the place. But if I am just craving good ol dimsum, I am going to RolSan"}
{"text":"Dim Sum ends at 3:45 PM during the week - made it there just after 3 PM with a colleague born in Hong Kong - the place was empty as the lunch crowd was long back to work. We sat down ordered our Bolei Tea and began our Dim Sum experience. We chose our selections placed the order and dishes started to arrive. The Seafood Congee was amazing, deep fried crab was excellent; ordered the usual staples including shui mai and har gow. The cha siu cheong fan and several dumplings (chinese pot stickers with various fillings) were top notch. I ordered a sticky rice dish that was again nothing short of amazing. (a pyramid of awesomeness) We also ordered this deep fried shrimp roll that contained pureed sweet potato w/ a dash of mayo. Bloody phenomenal - would go back again in an instant - price is about 40% higher than your usual Dundas/Spadina offerings but worth every penny. Bay Street and Wellesley may just  be my new destination for future Dim Sums.

P.S.  A big Thank You to Ms. Jill S. who informed me I posted my review to a wrong yelp address."}
{"text":"The dinner isn't great - just a lot of flash presentation (ie. decor of fake marble, plush purple chair coverings etc.). Looks impressively palatial from outside on Bay Street but as you get closer, it looks kind of tacky. I tried some leftover dim sum before so I think I'd be up for trying that another time."}
{"text":"Crown Princess, congratulations on giving me the most hilarious dining experience of my life. 

I took my boyfriend here after reading plenty of reviews stating its opulence and general greatness. So on a rainy, Tuesday night I decide to come here for something warm and comforting.  We walk in and are the only people there. We open the menu, it's quite expensive! But we kind of felt bad leaving and it was too soon to brave the rain again. It doesn't take long for one to realize that this is no ordinary Chinese restaurant. 

We had so many people waiting on us! Helping us order, bringing out the food (in a maid outfit), another person to serve the food to us.  It was madness! But hilarious madness, because literally being the only patrons, university kids at that, it means everyone is kind of amused by us too. Everything from the pillars, slabs of marble upon marble to the gold plated place setting- great. We were confused at times as to what was the polite way of doing things but gave up by the end of the meal. 

To start, we had some Chinese beer that was excellently poured right in front of us, no tilt of the cup, no foam. Next came some spring rolls (hot, delicious, crunchy) and minced chicken and corn soup (balanced, yummy and just what we needed). Like I said, sometimes I didn't know what to do with myself or the plates but whatever. The main course we shared was a show stopper! Crab and wrapped vegetables came plated SO fancily! There was a whole head of perfectly cooked broccoli with the most tender crab meat all silky on top. Surrounding that offering were at least six bundles of veggies of asparagus and various mushrooms. We were the first people to have ordered this off the menu so they say. It was a very impressive dish and each time our plate was clean, a person would come over and refill. 

Note: You have to ask for the check; they will not just bring it to you. It made our exit a little awkward but eventually I worked up the courage to ask for it. As I signed off the bill (we take turns), I told them it was the bf's b-day (it wasn't) just to add to the hilarity. They were very sweet to us and wished us well. I want to come back and try the dim sum and then venue out with some more peeps around!"}
{"text":"What a joke. 
I went to this restaurant on a week night. The restaurant was having a function in one part of the restaurant and boy o boy they were having fun we thought this is going to be good. We were wrong. We sat for 10 minutes and final got a hello. We ask for a wine menu and the server gave us a look that we just arrived on earth. She went to get her manager that took another ten minutes. We got up a venture to Spadina street for Chinese food   
If a restaurant is outside China Town the server should be able to speak English. What a waste of time."}
{"text":"Weird. Very weird. Dim sum only served at lunch. They brought my husbands food and we had to wait another 20 mins for mine.  If you are with a large group and get one of the 4 person meals, you are waited on hand and foot. Otherwise, expect to sit there. My husband never even got his meal."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 8.5/10
Food: 8/10
Atmosphere: 7.5/10
Service: 7/10

Toronto dim sum by no means reaches to be at Markham dim sum levels, but Crown Princess does a royal (hehe pun intended) job of satisfying that craving. 

Line-ups on weekends can get quite long. They'll seat you in this unnecessarily plush and extravagant dining room where you'll enjoy loads of the usual dim sum dishes."}
{"text":"The restaurant was quite empty when we arrived but got busier closer to lunch hour. My favourite dish was the pumpkin congee with lily($5.30 for a large). The waitress were attentive and took our empty plates away often, they will even rearrange the dishes and push they closer which was a nice touch.

Overall, the food was good but the one big turn off was when we asked for the bill the girl behind the counter came out and rushed us to pay. She didn't even show us the bill! Asked us how we would pay and since I was doggy bagging out left overs I didn't have a chance to check if we will over billed. We ended up getting charged for a large dish we never ordered. I guess it partial our fault for not doubling checking but for a high end dim sum restaurant to run this sort or sketchy business practice it's unacceptable.

This restaurant would have received 4/5 stars for decor, food and attentiveness to customers but lost one star for over charging us and rushing us to pay. 

Just always check your bill to make sure you are correctly charged!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice and the food is always delicious. We came for Chinese New Year and they had dragon dancers."}
{"text":"*trumpet sounds* I crown you, my favorite dim sum spot in the hood!

Compared to Dynasty on Bloor, the prices at Crown Princess are a bit cheaper, the food is better, so now I don't have to go to Dynasty ever again!

When you open the large wooden doors, you step into an elegantly decorated dining room.  Sparkling chandeliers and marble, definitely one of the nicer dim sum spots downtown. 

They use decorative teapots and cups with handles!  The servers are decked out in maid uniforms and were very attentive and friendly, smiling and greeting me as I walked in.

Usually, when I want dim sum, I have to drive uptown.  The issue I have  with Chinatown is that the dim sum never tastes quite as fresh.  ...And I've seen one too many chefs picking their noses as they cooked.  Anyways....

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food at Crown Princess.
* The hai gow and siu mai was hot and delicious.
* BBQ pork rice noodle rolls were my favorite item that we ordered.
* Sticky rice come in little rectangles.  Tasty but super small.
* Octopus was good... a whole lot of tentacles in a fried batter nest bowl.
* Curried tendon was okay, but could have been more tender.

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here.  None of the items were particularly inventive but they were all tasty!

If you don't want to make the trek north, the dim sum here is some of the best I've had downtown.

If only I could wake up early enough for the early bird special!!!"}
{"text":"For a dim sum spot on the east side of the downtown core, it's not bad and quite surprisingly pretty inside. The food is decent, the service is good (their outfits are questionable) and with lots of seating to accommodate large groups, it's high on the list for vendor lunches. Overpriced in my opinion. This is not a place I'd take my Chinese family or relatives as there is better in Chinatown and Makrham/Scarb."}
{"text":"Really frustrating experience here. We made a reservation and they gave it away to another group even though we were right on time and even saw our name on the reservation sheet. The host then promised us another table and gave it away again! Instead of apologising, he blamed it on us and said we weren't there. We were waiting right in front of him the entire time! So rude! In total we were waiting for 40 min before we left."}
{"text":"I've been here many times for dim sum and it's consistently the best dim sum in downtown Toronto. It's a little bit pricey compared to the chinatown dim sum but the difference in quality is notable. Just take something as traditional and simple as the shrimp dumpling (har gow) for example. The shrimp filling tastes fresher and the wrapper has exactly the right consistency (not too sticky and not too dry). My favourites dishes include the chicken feet, spare ribs, and fish congee. 

The weekend lineups around brunch/lunch time can get a little crazy so make sure you call ahead to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Never had dim sum in such a fancy place before!! Came here to meet up with a friend. Super fancy looking place with chandeliers and fancy teacups...a nice experience =) very different from the places I'm used to in sauga. 

There's some items that I wouldn't normally find on a menu where I live so it was a nice change. Everything was so yummy! What I like about this place is that the food is cooked to order and not on a cart with someone pushing it around for hours until someone orders it! 

Portions are fairly big (the size of the har gow, shui mai and custard buns were bigger than what I'm used to). Flavours are great and you can tell that everything is made fresh! Their sauces for dipping on the side were so good! Their chili oil and peanut sauce were on point

After walking in and quickly realizing how fancy it was, I kinda expected the dimsum to be better than it was. Still great and better than average BUT not as great and fancy as the place looks! 

Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Overall the food is excellent, really tasty, a good amount of favouring. My favourites are the crispy BBQ pork bun, Phoenix chicken feet, just simply a taste of heaven. Only down side is that the service could be better, there's a long wait to get simple dim sum dishes and the wait for a table is even longer."}
{"text":"No salty and no strong taste. Good atmosphere. I like it. But milk pudding is not my type."}
{"text":"One of the more fancier dim sum restaurants in the downtown area. Quality is always good and consistent. Service is better than other dim sum restaurants. Of course, this comes at a cost: higher bill. This is a regular spot for me on the weekends when I'm craving dim sum.

There are long lines during the weekends, so if you are impatient, come between 10-11am or after 130pm if you want a shorter line."}
{"text":"Crown Princess is probably my favourite place for dim sum outside of Chinatown in downtown Toronto. Better quality food than the local restaurants in Chinatown but also higher in price. Delicious shrimp & scallop dumplings and BBQ pork pastry. 

The only thing I do not recommend is the crispy shrimp with Mayo."}
{"text":"After an early flight from Montreal with a 9-hour layover in Toronto, this little gem provided the necessary fuel do some fast and furious shopping damage. Notwithstanding the efficiency of the service, staff was rather on the 'cool' side, just as you would expect them to be towards three very excited white French Canadian women on vacation. The dim sum was good, although I missed the 'cart delivery system'. Loved the bbq eel in the flaky pastry, the fact that the jasmin tea was replenished consistently but mostly the more than reasonable prices.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"Crown princess has been my go-to place to bring out-of-town-ers, as it's clean, the food is 'different', and the service has always been good. 
This was the first time I'd been to Crown Princess since the menu changed and they dropped the early bird special (Which means I won`t be going to be going as regularly any more - only to bring guests). 

Service: 4.5/5
The service here is almost always great. Only one particular waitress is less polite than I would normally expect, but still never rude. Our plates were changed no less than 3 times, despite not having any bones or shells in our dimsum, and the teapot was always full. 

Food: 3.4/5
The menu here is creative, taking classic dimsum items and adding a slight western flair. I wouldn't say that the food here is astounding, but it is most definitely good, with attention to detail, and their consistency is balanced well with occasional off menu specials.
Their regular menu would earn them a strong 4/5. However, I would have two criticisms. The first being an excessive emphasis on luxury. The fois gras and caviar siu mai does not taste bad by any means, but tastes just like that, fois gras, caviar, and siu mai. Separate items that don't gain any synergy from their combination
My second criticism is on the special that I tried today, Scallops in-shell with XO sauce. The scallops had not been parted from the shell, so they were somewhat difficult to eat. Additionally, the scallops were overcooked, and the XO sauce did not have any flavour than straight chili oil - excessively spicy. This is the only food here that I have tried and have not liked. There may be some people who would enjoy the spiciness of this dish, but I don't think that this caters towards the general market that crown princess targets.

Atmosphere: 3.7/5
I take points off here because again, the focus on luxury is excessive. This is something I would expect of places uptown or in Hong Kong, but at times, it's a nice change. This place has pleasant service and cleanliness; from a downtown chinese restaurant, what more can expect? One thing to note is that unlike regular chinese restaurants, this place isn`t built for regular big parties of 10 or 12. They have the capacity to do one or two of these tables a night, but the tables are set up largely for small groups of two to five.

Price: 3.25/5
I wouldn't say that this place is worth the price it charges. For two people, the bill came to $50 before tip for 5 dimsum dishes, and two portions of the scallop. I would normally want to tip more at nice place like this with good service, but am always a little hesitant because the price that they're charging isn`t in line with what I would normally associate with dimsum in the downtown area."}
{"text":"An update is long overdue for this place as I had more dinners here than the dim sum visits (which is one of the best IMO for downtown). A friends family is partial to this cuisine when a celebration is due so we end up coming here every few months. They tend to order mainstream items though I manage to sneak in an authentic dish here and there. So instead of going a play by play of a certain meal I will rate the dishes we end up having
Spring roll: not a fan as I get the crab claw. I have tried it a few times though and didn't enjoy it. Functional at best.  Crab claw is good.
Chicken corn soup/hot and sour soup. Both are serviceable and meet the expectations.
Lemon chicken (don't ask) comes with a glossy sauce. The chicken is deep fried with a thick batter. Not my choice but seems well liked. Hmm a little above food court level as at least there is meat and not just batter. 
Vegetable medley: well balanced and with an option to substitute vegetables is a good option for picky eaters. Good skill level as has a light finish. 
Sichuan chicken: done well here comes with fried kale for a nice texture and taste balance. One of the well liked dishes.
Sichuan prawns: ok I guess as the batter isn't thick. Otherwise just an ok take on this dish with nothing to set it apart. 
Cashew chicken: hmm another filler of a dish which is a crowd pleaser.
Beef tenderloin with onions and sweet sauce. I recall this as Chinese style beef steak from childhood and was my go to dish in Hong Kong, Singapore etc. While not on a sizzling platter it's half decent. I order it for nostalgic value perhaps. 
The service is decent as now we are treated as regulars. It was decent to begin with. 
I think this is the best option for this cuisine at this price point without venturing out to the suburbs. Solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome and flavourful food, definitely a good place for quality dim sum. 

Try the cabbage looking dumplings, I ordered a couple of dim sum dumplings therefore forgot which one it was lol.

Decor is on point :)"}
{"text":"Crown Princess is just south of one of Toronto's chicest intersections.  That may explain why this is no ordinary Chinese restaurant.  It's fancy, although personally, I think it's an oxymoron to say fancy Chinese restaurant.  

Crown Princess is definitely going for a regal atmosphere.  It's rich in gold and purple, with chandeliers.  Still, at the end of the day, I don't think ornate decor should translate to ridiculously jacked up prices unless the quality of the food was just as impressive.
 
Let's see how it fared...

On a stupendously hot Friday I hit Crown Princess for some dim sum.  Keep in mind that Chinese food is one of my LEAST favourite foods.  Further, I haven't eaten said food for months.  I was sort of looking forward to some dim sum.  

I arrived sweaty, hungry and slight cranky.  I met my buddy there and we took a seat.  I quickly cheered up in the comfort of air conditioning and the joy of a Diet Coke.  Service was pleasant but rough.  The restaurant was clean, as were the chopsticks and plates.  (Most Chinese restaurants I've been to require the patron to give their utensils a quick hot tea rubdown.)

We ordered our dim sum and they arrived hot and yummy.  Of the many dim sum places downtown, it was definitely less greasy and heavy.  We were happily satisfied.

Their dishes also got points for presentation:

We finished with some dessert - the mango pudding arrived in the shape of a fish.  That made me giggle.

The bill came to about $50 for two people; that's more than what I'm used to paying but we had a GROUPON.  Hip hip hooray, hip hip hooray."}
{"text":"I visited 2 times. The first experience was great, so I revisited.
The second time however, our food came really late although they weren't that busy. 
Next time, I wouldn't drink tea because they charge for it."}
{"text":"Richmond Hill-quality dim sum at Richmond Hill prices, but located in downtown Toronto. What more can you ask for? All the staples are great, and I'd also recommend giving some of the chef's recommendations a try. Be prepared to wait in line if you don't make a reservation."}
{"text":"The interior design of the restaurant is surprisingly fancy. The food in general is great, but a bit overpriced. The liu sha bao is my favorite! It looks and tastes different from normal liu sha bao i have had in restaurants before. But it is delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place is overpriced, especially given the taste of the dishes. The dishes were extremely salty and oily, and we couldn't stop drinking tea. Overall, we don't feel like the quality of the food justifies their cost. Also, the service from the manage/supervisor was a bit terrible with no smile on the face whatsoever. It's a bad choice for anyone who wants a good dim sum experience. Avoid it at any cost."}
{"text":"It's good.  It's reliable.  It's clean.  It's downtown.  

I would rather drive uptown and eat at the sister restaurant for half the price (during happy hour) and now that I think about it, I would rather drive uptown and pay regular price too.  The portions uptown are much larger.

On the flip-side, service is definitely better at this location.  A little more courteous, that's for sure.  The clientele isn't as brusque either.  That's a definite pro."}
{"text":"Can be a bit pricey, but you'll have anticipated that walking in through the palatial decor. 

I've only tried the dinner menu here, not the dimsum, but I can vouch for some of the \"big\" items that generally can go terribly wrong in other restaurants: Peking duck, bass, grouper, lobster, and crab."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Food sizes were great, ingredients were fresh.  Tea was good, but got cold quick, so you only got 2 cups of hot tea and then you had a huge pot of cold tea.  Love the mustard and the hot sauce they give you on the table.  

They took my favourite fried sesame balls off the dessert menu :(

Service was good, but once they got busy (and we were done) it was VERY obvious they wanted us to get the hell out of there.  Not a place to linger, but a great place for downtown dim sum."}
{"text":"Went for dinner.  The decor is really impressive -- my nephew actually took pictures of the men's room.  Service is *very* efficient -- our water glasses and tea cups were always full.  

Portions are large, and the food is good.  The menu is a little limited, especially for soups and appetizers -- if any of your party are looking for \"regular\" Chinese food, they may be a little disappointed with their options.  

A little pricey, but reasonable given the decor and the quality of the food.  

Since we went for dinner, we were unable to try the dim sum."}
{"text":"The Crown Princess is an interesting Dim Sum place to review for a number of reasons. First, it's not your typical Dim Sum place in Toronto. The decor and staff are not typical for Dim Sum. The place has a kind of Euro/French upscale style to it that seems a bit out of place but is still quite a pleasure if such things matter to you in a restaurant.

More importantly, the food itself is very good. I've been to a fair number of Dim Sum places in and around Toronto and Crown Princess does offer quality in the higher end of the spectrum. I even find it funny that their Shu Mai has a dollop of foie gras on top. It's like they wanted to accent their food with a touch of their Euro/French fru fru style too. :P It tastes nice at least. ;)

That all being said, I can't give this place a very high rating because the prices are fairly outlandish for what you get. Yes, the quality is on the high end but the prices are not equivalent. 

It's clear to me that Crown Princess caters mostly to people who go to restaurants to show off their wealth to the people they socialize with rather than to those who care about the food and only the food. If you don't care about the prices, then you'll love this place. If you do care about value to some degree then you can find the same quality Dim Sum at cheaper prices at a good number of other places around the city. You'll find many of those other options amongst the other places I've written reviews for. :)"}
{"text":"The experience here is really Disappointing!! I came with high expectations cuz it's under one of my friends recommendation. We had our food unusually bitter and it is not like what I used to be served in here, the manager insisted that there is nothing wrong with the food when I constantly explained to her that it's not the same thing as I used to have. When we were charged they automatically charged the tips like they think they should get tips for every service they provide even if the service doesn't deserve so. 

If the food was not good I at least expect them to show politeness."}
{"text":"Not worth it, it is not outstanding in any way.   Food is slightly above average and the wait was too long, about 40 min.  Overall, it was disappointing."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Can't complain about much nor can you rave about much.  It is clean. Nice.  The food ranges from good to very good.  Fried scallops with chicken a treat. Snow peas cooked perfectly.  Noodles, meh. Seafood fried rice, terrific.  Service was good. Presentation good.  Most everything was good. The decor over-the-top: marble framed marble on marble walls.  Entertaining decor! The experience just didn't feel as authentic as, for example, New Sky Restaurant on Spadina.  Decent and good but not too memorable."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in, you're surrounded by these columns that look like they're cut from marble, chandeliers glittering from above your head, and the waitstaff in french maid outfits running about. There's a definite \"wow\" factor as soon as you're seated, but you're also met with pure confusion; as the style of the tea sets are English, the staff are donned in vintage French garments, the food is Asian, and the service is...well, frustrating, but we'll get to that later. I feel as if they're trying to combine elements that just don't work for them - as the maid outfits aren't for serving food in traditional time period, the tea isn't supposed to be full of teabags, and the plates aren't supposed to be thrown down on the table (at least, to my knowledge in common waiter/waitress etiquette).

I guess because we were all unsuspecting college kids ordering (basically) everything off the menu, they assumed we didn't know what we were doing. This isn't my first dim sum, or \"high-class\" venue, but they sure did like to think so. We were pushed and prodded to hurry up in ordering, as there were businessmen, posh upper-class moms, and regulars who they apparently needed to conserve all their good vibes for. I understood, but when they charged us for three meals that we never ordered, and had never arrived (it was another table that ordered it for themselves), they continued to argue with us until the other gentlemen went and explained with a few choice words. Got that settled quickly - and without apology on the staff's part.

As excited as I was to find a dim sum place with these hours, my experience here was pretty.. alright. The food was brilliant, and the ambience noteworthy, but they do seem to stereotype quite easily. I'd bring a couple of important-looking people if I ever wanted good service, to be completely honest."}
{"text":"The \"Princess\" leaves the \"Casa\" (actually, two \"Casa\") and her \"Prince\" behind in Markham-dom to venture into a foreign land called downtown. 

If you've been to any of the Crown Prince or Casa Imperial or Casa Victoria establishment in northern suburb, this place will look and feel familiar. 

Dim Sum Style -- order from a dim sum menu, no push carts. 

Food -- same quality and taste as its sister restaurants in Markham and North York, but better presentation. 

Decor -- same style as the other royal-sounding restaurants in this group, mega watts of chandeliers, marble everywhere, royal purple plush chair covering. Definitely over the top, not my style, but it has its fans. 

Service -- I didn't find it better than at the North York or Markham location. In fact, I recognize a couple of the managers and senior servers who used to work in Markham / North York locations. 

Keep this on the to-go list? -- sure, I'd recommend this place for people who live or work downtown. Higher prices plus parking fees, offset by savings in gas and time for not having to trek north."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner last night. Everything was beautifully plated, but otherwise forgettable. I'm not changing my rating from 4 stars because the dim sum is thoroughly enjoyable. Too bad their dinner isn't as amazing."}
{"text":"We purchased a $25 for $50 dinner Groupon and thus it was our first occasion at this restaurant.  Dinner was scheduled for 5 pm. and upon arrival, we found no one!  Turns out there was a wedding sectioned off and when we went to the smaller general dining section, not a single staff member was there!  After locating a staff member, we were seated.  The decor was very fancy...very much like English high tea.  It was a very interesting fusion of Chinese cuisine in a classy European restaurant.  

We ordered the lobster with ginger and green onion, sweet and sour pork, Cantonese chow mein, shrimp balls and steamed rice.  Unfortunately, the order in which the items came out was terrible!  Our lobster was first...so with no steamed rice, it just sat there for 10 mins., getting colder and more unappetizing.  Then our shrimp balls arrived and boy did we devour it down as we were so unimpressed with the delayed service!  Then came the sweet and sour pork...again, no steamed rice in sight...so it just sat there.  Finally, after asking a staff member about our rice, it came!...alongside the Cantonese chow mein.  We couldn't figure out why steamed rice would take so long but meh, we were just famished by then!  Overall, the food was true Chinese cuisine.  The portions were a bit modest, especially given the pricing!

The service was interesting.  Every dish required two staff members in French-maid uniform to serve.  The presentation of our Cantonese chow mein was most impressive, with the fried noodles completely on its side; a staff member mixed the dish, portioned and served it.  

Overall, the food was quite acceptable but not overwhelming either.  The prices are at least double what it would be in a typical Chinese restaurant...I suppose you are paying for the decor, ambiance and location as well.  We had complimentary dessert (sweet papaya soup and two cookies) which was nice.  The service was mindful although a bit slow.  If we did not have a Groupon, it would have been ridiculously expensive but still with the discount, it was not really worth it.  We would recommend it for a one-time experience but not as a usual dining experience."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on New Years day with my family and it was packed! Well it is normal for Chinese people to have dimsum so I wasn't surprised with the long line up. 

Inside of the restaurant was extremely nice probably one of the nicer dimsum places I've been too. 

Food was amazing, I really enjoy eating Shrimp dumplings (Har Gau) so of course I had to order it! Enjoyed all 11 dishes ordered and would definitely go back if I was in the area!"}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I hear the cheap dim sum deal is done.  *tear*"}
{"text":"It's like going to a regular dim sum place but with smaller portions and higher prices. 

I always leave hungry and feeling ripped off. 

I would be ok with all that if the recipes were exceptional or eccentric but they are not. 

So many more interesting dim sum options in the city."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars! There were some good and some alright items. The durian puff and char sew pastry were really good :) I especially loved the durian puffs!
However I found most of their steamed food average. The sau mai was too..meaty? The noodle rolls had spinach in them which didn't go well with the shrimp/char sew. The rolls were also extremely thick (flour)."}
{"text":"Update:  No longer offer the early bird, before 11am special."}
{"text":"A great place downtown to satisfy lunch time dim sum cravings. Make sure you make resos!

All the dumpling choices are great, especially the shrimp and scallop ones. They have a few twists on the old favourites as well, like the \"goose liver and caviar Sui Mai\".

The decor makes me cringe but at least it's something different?"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing I loved everything except service everyone was nice except one of them ,The old Lady"}
{"text":"Wow, it's a good thing this place has good food to compensate, because the decor looks like elton john designed it on crack without his glasses.

I was excited to try this place after the reviews on Yelp.  I got the opportunity to today when my friend had suggested that we go there.  Sadly, we didn't take advatange of the before 11 AM special because nobody got up early enough after a full night of post-halloween drink-fest.

Anyways, the food was great, one of the best for downtown dim sum, for sure.  It is more on the upscale side (more than bright pearl, less than dynasty) but it wasn't as bad as people had said - it's FINE DINING.  And they hired ELTON JOHN to decorate it... 

We had a little bit of everything.  The HAR GOW was steamed to perfection, the BBQ PORK BUNS and PASTRY were sweet and savoury all at once, the SHRIMP ROLLS with SPINACH was divine and different than other dim sum restaurants, and the CHICKEN FEET had wondeful flavourful and succulent right off the bone.

The mediocre things about the food were, the TURNIP CAKES (although tasty), were very flaky.  There was a HAR GOW with LEEKS and PEANUT, which for some who like peanut in their food may have enjoyed, but I didn't care for the crunchy texture in my har gow.  The STEAMED PORK BONES was fatty, so that was ok.  The selection, although the key basics were there, was quite limited to the traditional stuff.  They had some variations on some oldies, which we didn't try.  

Now, for your personal interest about the decor... all I have to say is, how much did they spend decorating this place???  They have marbles walls, and marble art framed with....marble.  Purple velvet walls with bling bling to the max.  Beautiful chandeliers (there were like 5 in one room) overdone.  Gaugy, tacky, and over-oppulent, made the dining experience a very bright one.

Overall, the food was great, everything had very fresh and distinct flavour.  I have enjoyed the best dim sum in Vancouver, and I have to say, this is somewhat comparable.  

Now, I hear uptown has some of the best dim sum the GTA has to offer, but in the meantime, I would definately come here again, whether it's before or after 11 AM!"}
{"text":"Yummy. I don't really care for the grandeur and opulence of the decor, but at least it's clean! It's not your typical Chinese place, with loud rude servers and messy bathrooms and shouting Chinese families. 
Most of the patrons are actually very diverse and a lot of westerners. 

Food wise, lots of choice, and something different from the normal dim sum fare, like Milk Tart with Birds Nest and Roast Duck dumplings. There's also a cute pig looking pork bun. 

I found that the pastries and desserts were excellent. Flakey and not dense. Try the Trio of Sesame Dumplings (not in the dessert section, in the Fried Section).

The other things, like the rice noodle and the chicken feet could have had more flavour. But overall, I really liked it. 

Come early on a Sunday morning before 11am, not for the special discount (they don't have that any more) but to grab a seat. It got really busy around 12pm. Also free parking on Bay Street on Sundays before 1pm!

Tip: Make a reservation! Don't get caught in the line up at the door."}
{"text":"No more early bird special people!

Certainly a unique experience.  Glad we went.  Having dim sum with marbles and chandeliers.  Crazy idea but somehow it works I guess.

All the dishes are very delicate, hence smaller than usual. The best chicken feet I had.  Higher quality for sure, the atmosphere may have clouded my judgement though.

Prices are actually not as bad as I thought it would be.  We came around 9.30am to make sure we can get the early bird special.  No more!!  

Before 11am it is limited menu only.  They don't have the cute face pork buns for example.  But no wait on a Saturday morning.  Service is spectacular.

Not sure if ill be back - I prefer my dim sum in carts, not china plates."}
{"text":"Visited Sun April 16 for Dim Sum party of 3
Arrived at 10:30am, they don't offer early bird discounts anymore. The place was already half-full. Service was great, it takes a little while to get the food and then it all comes at once. 

Pros
Highlights include fried shrimp roll and pan friend turnip cake. 
Prices:
Small $3.90
Medium $4.90
Large $5.90

Cons
A bit pricy compared to Chinatown, come for a special occasion and experience feeling like royalty.
Try and sit away from the door, the cold air would still come in even though there is a double door. 
Ordered a fish maw congee which was X-large and $12!
They also charge $1.60 per person for tea! Tea costs mere cents and honestly should even be a charge. Next dinners, try and get this removed and see if they will allow this.

Damage - $71 for 9 dishes before tip

Protip - Most items come with three pieces, so order accordingly."}
{"text":"I really liked this place!  Went there 3 times during my mom's 5-day visit to Toronto and she enjoyed that place very much!!  She loves dim sum but she is also picky on the atmosphere. As you all have known, many Chinese restaurants have great food but less elegant. This place is perfect! It's quiet and nicely decorated. Service is impeccable. It has dim sum till 4pm which is also good for some late lunch.

Some people said it's over-priced - my mom def wouldn't agree. First of all the food tastes amazing (the ginger milk pudding  is worthy of special mentioning). Second of all, everything is in relatively large portion. My mom hasn't tried many places in Toronto so she can't compare, but she believes our experiences here well worth every penny we paid. 

Brought my bf here for dinner once too, and and he said it is indeed much more expensive than most Chinese restaurant (esp if you order seafood). But he also gives compliments for the food as well.

Will keep this place at my top list and surely will come back once a while."}
{"text":"Great place to meet a group for dim sum brunch.  Busy, lively, great food.  All last year we went here at least 10 times and it was a satisfying weekend brunch each and every time."}
{"text":"Pricey, but you get what you pay for. Also, why are there so many more Chinese diners here compared to other Chinese restaurants in around the area?"}
{"text":"Pros:
- Delicious! Great dim sum with great presentation!
- The tea and plate sets were adorable
- We found metered street parking across the street

Cons:
- Very very expensive. It was over 200 cad for 6 people."}
{"text":"Wow ! What an experience, my friends and I recently acquired an appetite for dim sum. We found entering the restaurant similar to entering a dumpling palace but it took some time before we were seated at this dining palace. Believe me when I say though, the food is well worth the wait and the interior design is remarkable."}
{"text":"Worse service ever!! They missed order our food, we finished everything and waited for another 30 mins, our food never came. We asked 3 different servers to check our food for us and none of them came back. After 45 mins another guy came back tells me they never put in our order! This is ridiculous. If there was no star I would give a no star."}
{"text":"Decor is weird but maybe they are trying a theme...but we eat for the taste not \"taste\" in decor? 

Pork dumplings with goose liver? Don't try too hard to be fancy...your not...

Charging for tea for my kids? Nickel and diming -1 Star

Banana leaves sticky rice...just that...rice with no filling.

Good pork buns but kind of small...if it was a drink...it be a shot not a full glass.

Overall for a downtown dim sum better than average but I'd rather drive north."}
{"text":"Do not be mislead by the \"fine dining\" name and the fancy looking interior. This is just another Chinese restaurant  that charges way too much for its average tasting food. Went with my girlfriend and got the lemon chicken and stir fried assorted veggies."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Bad attitude service. Plenty of other options in the city but best would be uptown in Markham. Not returning"}
{"text":"I read many reviews that recommended the Crown Princess, so sought this out as one of our must go to places on our trip to Toronto. 
Unfortunately I was not impressed by the food.  Maybe my pallet is just not sophisticated enough or maybe I'm used to Americanized Chinese food, but this was not what I expected and the flavors were bland. 
The menu made no sense as the sizes S, L, XL did not match the number of items that arrived in each Dim Sum order, for example, the XL crispy shrimp with mayonnaise sauce came with 3 pieces and the S scallop and shrimp dumpling had 3 pieces.   The chicken Lo mien was flavored with way too much fish sauce and little or no other spices/salt.... I could barely swallow the sticky rice with chicken for the same reason. 
The barbecued ribs were nearly all bone, gristly and fatty.  
Unfortunately the kids would not eat anything we ordered.  Even though the service and ambiance was nice, our $70.00 lunch for four left me feeling ripped off."}
{"text":"I'm really in awe of the decor here.  I definitely come here for design tips for my future place.  The satin, faux marble and purple velvet just scream opulence.

Dinner food is OK though. Portions are a bit smaller than at other places but the food is a tad less greasy/salty than other restaurants."}
{"text":"The decor is luxe almost to the point of comedy. Golden doors, jewel studded purple velvet walls, massive chandeliers, and more marble than you've ever seen. 

The food delivers though - and while pricier than your usual chinatown dim sum, it's far cheaper than you'd expect (especially if you make it there in time to take advantage of the before 11am deals). The har gao is delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the more 'expensive' dim sum joints in the city. 
Mind you, amongst the two dining companions and myself, we ordered $75 worth of food and were stuffed at the end of the meal.

The decor is really fancy (refer to photos of the tea pot and plates).

They supposedly take resos for dim sum, but we were seated right away without being asked for our name.

Some recommendations:
- fried rice (with heaps of seafood, chicken, and pork)
- jumbo fried shrimp (wrapped like a spring roll with mayo)
- Japanese style dumplings

A solid 4 star for dim sum."}
{"text":"Found smack dab between the Dumpling King and the Dumpling Queen (no relation) we find another Dumpling-offering member of the royal family: The Crown Princess.

Word of warning: My very intelligent dad, who has been witness to many of the greatest 20th century technological advances in doors, thought that the windows next to the actual entrance were a set of automatically retracting ones. According to legend he stood there for several minutes until he realized the door handle a few metres to his left. He's only been an official \"senior citizen\" for a couple months! This is why we let em get into the movies for a buck cheaper, folks.

Anyway, once you find your way to the door, you'll be treated to a wonderfully elegant vintage decor (feel free to rearrange that sentence into the opening rap of a song about Dim Sum). The servers all wear old fashioned outfits as well, in the style of (as my girlfriend put it) Nicole Kidman in any of her period-piece movies.

I'm no Dim Sum expert, but I'd say I've been around the block at least once. By comparison, and to be quite honest, I can't really tell the difference between Crown Princess' offerings, and those of Lai Wah Heen, Casa Imperial, or any of the other \"upscale\" Dim Sum places in the GTA. From the Ha Gow, to the Curry squid, to the Turnip cake - it's all delicious. I highly recommend finishing the meal with a salted egg bun. The service is always top-notch, and the food is fast. The prices are in range with other restaurants of the same calibre.

We tend to go around 11 on the weekend - by the time we leaver, there seems to be a line formed, so I'd recommend getting there around the same time to avoid a wait.

If you want some more adventure in your life, I also recommend \"The Royal Dumpling Crawl\" (trademarked, suckers) where you start at the Queen, and eat a plate of dumplings at each royal house from here to Chinatown. The first person to finish all three plates gets to wear a crown that they'll irrationally buy at the nearest Dollarama."}

The host was completely unhelpful our concerned that he first lost our reservation, then seated a party in front of us."}
{"text":"In my books, this is the place to go for refined dim sum in Yorkville area.  I'm mean it's not easy to get good food, service and decor with Chinese faire.  Let's start with the food. The dim sum is well executed, but not particularly creative and done little flair.  I think that's forgivable.  The service is very good by Chinese restaurant standards.  They're fast, polite and most of their staff speak English, which is no easy feat in our fair city!  The most remarkable feature of the resto is definitely the decor.  It's tacktastically glorious: chandeliers, marble, gold-gilded teapots is all I can think of.  Pull these together and it makes for a nice, fancy dim sum lunch. 

It's definitely not cheap.  We ended-up paying about $20/person and we had our selection of dishes.  The key to keeping the price down is to order less SP (special) and XL (extra-large) dishes.  Watch-out for those cuz they could easily add $5-$10 to your total!"}
{"text":"Dropping my review down a star for getting rid of the Early Bird dim sum. :( It's delicious and fancy, but I'm not sure if it's delicious enough to warrant a price premium."}
{"text":"omg this place was such a random discovery but omg it serves the best peking duck ever!

I came here after some school projects - and we ordered a whole bunch of random everything. the duck was the most memorable! Absolutely yum crispy duck served two ways - wayyy too much for two people. share it with a few more people and you are golden. 

YAS to the duck!"}
{"text":"The beautiful Baroque-style interior along with the English-style tea sets certainly added an extra oomph to dim sum here at the Crown Princess. The food was quite good - I particularly enjoyed the taro croquettes. What I wasn't too thrilled about was that the staff were somewhat uninformative when it came to questions about dessert (we simply wanted to know if they had egg custard tarts, which are staples to every dim sum experience but we ended up being redirected to another server) and that tip was already included in our bill...at least they informed us about the tip inclusion. If we weren't, we would've overpaid! Beautiful restaurant and great dim sum - just be aware that tip is included in the bills."}
{"text":"The waiting  list system is horrible, goes by number for a while and then by name. So confuing, and its very obivous that soneone was able to reserve seat, and when I called they specifically said no reservation. WTF?"}
{"text":"I usually go in for Dim Sum, but went this time to celebrate a birthday during the evening. It's a nice quite place for a classic peking duck coursed meal. The service was really good especially since we were a bit of a larger party (14) and the kids had to be put at another table but they were treated very nicely sometimes even getting first pick at some of the courses. Also there were some allergies throughout the group, which were handled nicely as well."}
{"text":"OMG this place. Crown Princess takes themselves too seriously, but wow it was fun to be a part of it. The decor theme is marble on marble on marble meets everything stereo-typically fancy, chandeliers, more marble and velvet chairs. The waiters look like cartoon characters in their uniforms. I enjoyed everything I ate, Pork Buns, Dim Sum, Pineapple Rice and so much more! I wished we had green tea instead of jasmine (maybe jasmine is fancier?). 

I went with about 6 other people on a Saturday afternoon. The service was great.  The menu is slightly confusing (3 menus, I think one of them was daily specials but it was just as long as the original menu. Then a separate rice menu.) We ordered WAY too much because their are no pictures and the descriptions are very brief. I really enjoyed our feast and time spent there! I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. The appearance of the dim sum is delicate and exquisite. The taste is delicious. The price isn't the cheapest, but it definitely is justifiable for the quality and taste of the final products. It is actually moderate price compare to the States.  I've had good dim sum in both California and New York, this place is by far the best I've had. I would even say this place has better dim sum from some places in hong kong, too."}
{"text":"First time I came here I loved it! Service was impeccable (that is really saying alot for a Chinese restaurant), the food was a slightly innovative take on dim sum, and portions/price were reasonable.
Loved the siu mai with foie on top and caviar instead of red roe. Also loved: the sticky meat dumplings, deep fried shrimp roll with mayo and pineapple, sticky rice is good, flaky taro pastry is good too, and bbq pork pastry delicious.
Every time I have come here since though the food gets slightly less and less good. I was so happy to have found a good dim sum place outside of Chinatown so it is more than a little disappointing. The siu mai was had a bit of gristly meat once, they put way too much pineapple in the shrimp roll so it was way too sweet, texture of the sticky meat dumpling is just not as good.

The decor is over the top but it is nice to eat in such a spacious environment, and a change from what you usually get when you go and get dim sum. For two people it usually comes to 37 dollars for 7 dishes.

Would I return? Yes. since there are not many decent dim sum places in the city."}
{"text":"Excellent dim sum! I highly recommend the duck dumplings and the mango pudding. But there is a lot of good stuff here. It's fancy but the prices are still very good."}
{"text":"Had Sunday brunch dim sum with a group of friends.  We ordered way too much food but yet it came to under $25 per person including tip which I thought was very reasonable.  All the dishes we had (and we had a huge variety) were solid.  Nothing over outstanding but everything was consistently good (and not greasy).  I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"We were here recently on our quest to find good dim sum in Toronto.  The place clean and people are nice, but the whole experience was just not that good.   The menu is hard to understand (M, L, XL with not seemingly rhyme or reason) and no prices.

My biggest complain is the dim sum was just not that good!   I've had much, much better (just not in Toronto).

I rated it Almost Not Bombastic"}
{"text":"I'm reviewing the dim sum menu, and I have never dined here for anything else. 

I'll start off by adding a disclaimer that I am boosting the rating of this place just because of convenience. It's close to Bay and College, and the dim sum is decent. Now, I wouldn't recommend driving over to this place from Markham or Chinatown, but because the dim sum selection is so limited in this area, I would give them 4 stars in comparison to the other dim sum places nearby.

The dim sum itself is ok, some of the dishes are better than others but overall, if you have a craving for dim sum, you likely won't be disappointed. There tends to be quite a bit of a wait time over the weekend, but it is a fairy large restaurant so waiting by the entrance isn't uncomfortable or awkward in any way. The service is quick and efficient, and it doesn't feel like you're waiting too long because there are tables constantly coming in and out.

The name itself does say fine dining, so you can't expect your run-of-the-mill dim sum place with Chinese ladies pushing carts - you just order what you want and they bring it to you, like a regular restaurant. All \"upscale\" dim sum restaurants do this, dim sum doesn't necessitate carts and loud yelling.

My biggest qualm about this place is the price. My usual dim sum order with friends would cost about $25 per person at this location, which is a bit steep for average quality dim sum. In comparison, Lai Wah Heen's upscale dim sum actually does look and taste upscale - but it does tend to cost double the price per person (~$50) so I usually have to settle for this place.

Nevertheless, I'm just simply happy that this restaurant exists, and I'll be coming back time and time again as long as I live nearby."}
{"text":"After getting food poisoning from Rol San in Chinatown, I try to stay away from Dimsum in that area. On the search for a new dimsum place...my friend recommended Crown Princess! Now I always come here for dimsum and it's my favourite in the downtown area. 

I enjoy the decor and their cutlery is one of the best I've seen so far. As soon as you walk in, you will feel the \"royal\" sensation that the restaurant gives off.

I always order the Eel Puff and Har Gow. Having tried majority of their dishes, I can say that most of them are hits instead of misses. I also enjoy their Pumpkin Congee (something I haven't seen elsewhere). 

Price wise...it's reasonable. For around 2 people it costed us $25 (incl tax+tip) per person."}
{"text":"It was a true restaurant to enjoy Dim Sum!! The place was decorated very well. Clean, bright, luxary and spacious. You can enjoy your food and talk to your friends happily.

The food were all delicious and fresh. The price was a little more expensive than some restaurants in Chinatown but it deserved. I cannot find any dishes that I dislike. Shrimp dumplings was amazing, up to three or four whole large shrimps inside. The chicken feet was my favourite. Flavourful, tender and almost melting in your mouth. The egg yolks buns were my second love. The custard was not too sweet and a little salty made it so delicious. Really die for it.

Tick your choices and write down the number of dishes. Then the waiters would send you various kinds of treasures.
But caution, every table must order their teas. It was like mandatory purchase."}
{"text":"This review is based on my dinner experience.

I came here once only for business dinner.   Food was good.  However, I expect better service for a so-called higher end (price wise) Chinese cuisine restaurant locating in downtown business district.  

We had a big table for a group of 9 people.  Since there was no private room, we requested a private corner instead.  From the beginning to the end, neither the manager nor the serving staff wore a smile.  They must have had a tough day?  Service was slow and very inattentive the whole time even the restaurant was not busy at all.  The server rarely came to check what we need, I and my colleague had to refill tea and alcohol by ourselves most of the time.  They did make our dinner experience pretty private!"}
{"text":"Giving 3 stars for a neutral review as i neither dislike or like it. For the experience of fine dining in dim sum....is it even worth paying the extra price? Marble flooring and walls to high chandeliers and super fancy tea pots. Waiters in tuxedos and waitresses in maid dresses. It is a bit to much to take in that dim sum is served in a place like this.

Where's the cart ladies that yell out what they have in the carts? Ha gow! Fong jow! I think that's how dim sum should always be served but that's just my preference.

Overall the flavor is all there the food is fresh and hot when it's served to your table. Would I came back again and fine dine? Maybe not, it is not the same without the steaming hot carts. You are just paying extra to sit in a fancy chair."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all for dinner this time. Everything was very greasy (even for the dishes that weren't supposed to be). The soup was probably the best part of the meal. The wait staff were very slow. It took 6 requests just to get 2 bowls of white rice. I'm guessing it's because they were quite busy with the big party that was in the other room. Had good meals here before but the quality seems to be really inconsistent lately. For the price, definitely don't think it's worth it."}
{"text":"If you live downtown and the uptown dim sum places like Spring Villa and Casa Imperial are too far away, AND you have a heavy wallet that needs to be emptied, make Crown Princess your go-to dim sum place!

They have excellent pan fried chive and shrimp cakes that DON'T have pork :O ultra rare!! And they have these excellent snow peak custard buns that just melt in your mouth. For real. And the rest of their menu is pretty tasty, too.

I'm getting hungry writing this review, so yeah, go check it out! :)"}
{"text":"Food: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Value: 3/5
Environment: 5/5

Similar to the sister restaurants uptown, Crown Princess serves high-quality dim sum without the loud hustle bustle you usually find at Chinese restaurants. The egg yolk bun, black bean pork ribs and shrimp dumplings were my favourite. We stayed at the restaurant chatting for 3 hours but the servers never hustled us and always refilled our teapot. Final bill came to be $90 for 3 people after tax - pricey but worth it!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!! First, one of the spare ribs was bloody and uncooked. The sensation of biting into raw, bloody meat is not at all pleasant. However, the worst part of the meal was by the horrendous service when paying the bill. A woman who I presume is the owner (short, short hair, glasses) came with our bill of $63.70 and said 'with tip you pay $70, 10% tip okay'. 

Wtf??? Why is she telling me how much tip I will pay, assuming right away I was not planning to tip? This was super insulting. Is it because I'm younger and I'm Asian that she presumes I am cheap? I can't imagine this interaction happening with, say, an older white couple. I have been here many times before and always, always tipped fairly. I guess she lost out an additional 5% tip because I always tip 15% or more. 

I will not be returning to this stupid restaurant where the owner insults her customers with unfounded, pre-conceived, and frankly racist notions."}
{"text":"I had a great experience coming here on a quiet Wednesday morning for a light brunch. We ordered the BBQ Pork Bun, the Pumpkin Congee with Lily and Corn, Fried Taro and Mushroom Dumplings, Sesame Balls, Rice Noodles with BBQ Pork, and Chicken Dumplings. The interior of the restaurant is very clean and elegant, and staff is friendly and polite. Although it might not be one of the best Dim Sum restaurants out there, it's definitely not a bad choice to come here and try it out."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times. Each time the service is better, which is the biggest obstacle this and most Chinese places face. 

The good things about this place are...

1. The decor is awesome. This is not some cheap Chinese joint. It is over the top with a sense of elegance that may seem gaudy, but also seems like a fancy Chinese place should be.
2. The food is good, but not anything out of the ordinary. It comes out hot and quickly. The dough is always soft and fresh.
3. I am always impressed that most patrons are Chinese. This is no pretender!"}
{"text":"Dim sum - Must try:
Steamed lamb
Rice noodle wrapped pork and shrimp

Recommended:
Pumpkin congee
Durian pastry
Shrimp and spinach rice roll
Scallop w XO sauce rice roll
Sticky rice
BBQ pork bun
Siu mai
Pork spare ribs in Black bean sauce
Chicken feet

Ok:
Curry squid. I love this dish, but it is inconsistent here. Very good sometimes, mediocre at other times.

This is the spot to take pictures and impress with fancy decor."}
{"text":"This was some seriously delicious and also aesthetically pleasing dim sum! My disappointment at the lack of carts being pushed around was definitely forgotten as soon as I saw the fantastic outfits the servers wear, the fine china teapot that we got for our green tea and then most definitely when I got to eat the food.

Things that stand out there are the octopus (cooked perfectly, with a yummy sauce), the dumplings and also the pork buns. Also, our waitress was very helpful when we had questions regarding menu sizes/prices/options. My only disappointment was that we couldn't easily find the vegetables. There did seem to be quite a few vegetarian options, though, which was a treat for our vegetarian companion.

I can honestly say that I have never seen such an insanely ornate dining room for dim sum. Or maybe ever. Perhaps the palace of Versailles had more marble on the walls, but not by much. Who doesn't like a piece of marble, framed by more marble, on a marble wall, with marble pillars? 

The only thing that wasn't as awesome was the shrimp roll that looked misleadingly like it was a normal shrimp roll, but then it had what can only be described as Miracle Whip with fruit cup fruits inside the coating. It was not the exciting surprise that I was hoping for!

I will be back. Not often because it's a bit pricey, but definitely when I want good dim sum."}
{"text":"So - the hubby and I checked out Crown Princess for the first time this past weekend.

The decor is over the top and the quality of the food is great!
What we had:
- bbq pork pastries  (jammed full of filling - yum!)
- har gow (lots of shrimp) 
- sui mai  (loved the black caviar topping)
- gyoza   (good - although not the trad pork)
- shrimp in wonton wrappers with mayo (these rocked)!

We had a few other things, but the above were the highlights.
The only thing that was a bit off for me was the whole reservation thing.

We called and reserved a table, and when we got there - we were treated the same as anyone doing a walk-in (aka we waited for 25 minutes).  So the point of a reservation is???  Not sure about this -- and we will probably go back -- the food was good, good quality even if not inexpensive."}
{"text":"Heard Toronto's known for great Canto food next to Vancouver in Canada, so of course I can't miss the chance to indulge in this delight. Careful perusing of BlogOT.com and ours truly Yelpers brought me to Crown Princess. 

Talk about FANCY.  This place has marble along the walls and crystal chandeliers everywhere, tea served in English tea settings, chopsticks with marble (print), cherng fun with it's own sweet soy pitcher. Think I unintentionally sat a lil straighter and spoke a lil softer; no shouting for my har gow and sui mai at the cart ladies. We ordered our dim sum from a checklist. 

As expected, all of the glitz comes with a price. Mine was pretty much double what I'd normally pay for dimsum, but I'd say it's worth the experience. Nowhere else can one find caviar and duck liver on the sui mai. And now that we're on the food...

1. Caviar and duck liver sui mai: delicious and a MUST get. Caviar was okay....didn't taste it much since there was so little of it and kept getting lodged between my teeth, but i'm a pate lover so that duck liver was an awesome compliment to the otherwise traditional version.
2. Har gow (shrimp dumpliing): not bad, but nothing special. Could use a lil salt.
3. Scallop and Shrimp dumpling: very similar to the har gow, but with scallop.
4. Pork rib: good. I like the broth, very flavorful...think it'd be great with ramen noodles.
5. Beef cherng fun: Great. Def not the standard stuff u'd find elsewhere. It's made with very tender sliced beef instead of ground meat and with a few strands of Chinese greens it in.
6. Turnip cake: solid good, but nothing crazy to talk about.

Very fresh ingredients and creative at times. Worth a trip if in town."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat dimsum at.  You know it's fancy Chinese when they use real table cloth in instead of plastic! Actually, is quite nice inside. But the food is really good. I usually come here on the weekends, first thing when I wake up. They open at 9am, and to me that's when dimsum is supposed to be consumed. At some point in the morning, they will get packed, and I'm not sure when, because I always try to beat the crowd.

The pumpkin congee is my favorite dish here. It's XL though, so beware of that when ordering. I also really like their zen dumplings. Those are the two things I always get, and then I try a bunch of their other stuffs. All are excellent."}
{"text":"The fam jam was also in town so obviously, we needed to go for dim sum. Ju recommended Crown Princess (her other rec was Rol Son, which we went to last time) and seeing as I'd never been here before, it was perfect. We came Saturday morning around 10:00am and we're able to grab a seat no problem. This place has to be one of the fanciest dim sum places I've ate at. Fine dining suits CP's name perfectly.

Hours are good. Every day of the week from 10:00am to 11:00pm.

Look at that entrance. You feel like royalty walking through that door. It gets even better inside. Plush, comfy, velvety pink seats, marble flooring and chandeliers. You're clearly paying for the upscale atmosphere but it's not too pretentious. I don't normally like fancy places but I liked it here. Maybe because it was still pretty

Dim sum menu is huge. It looks exactly like the one at T. Pot in Calgary. same font, style and colour. Interesting.

- 4x Tea ($1.60 each) - $6.40 for all four of us is some pricey dim sum tea but I will give them props, it was good tea. Plus look how fancy their tea pots are. Fine China game on point.

- Har gow (#2) ($5.80) - you can't ever go to dim sum without ordering the har gow. Good ratio of shrimp to skin.

- Goose liver & caviar siu mai (#3) ($6.80) - caviar! On siu mai! Can you get any fancier than that? Priciest siu mai's I've ever had but I liked the caviar sprinkled on top.

- Sticky rice with chicken meat wrap in lotus leaf (#7) ($5.80) - pretty standard lo mai gai but it's satisfying if you want some rice with the rest of your dishes.

- BBQ pork bun (#18) ($3.80) - we were too stuffed to eat this at the table but saved them for the road trip. Fluffy bun and the cha sui inside was tasty.

- Fried octopus tentacle (#24) ($6.80) - the octopus tentacles were bomb. One of my favourite dishes. Perfectly fried, light while still having a bit of chew to the texture. Probably could have ate a whole dish to myself.

- Pan fried turnip cake with pork meat (#29) ($4.80) - the lo bak go was pretty standard. Didn't love it, didn't hate it. Could have been crisped up more.

- Crispy taro & mushroom dumpling (#31) ($4.80) - wu gok was pretty decent. Crispy, not greasy.

- Baked BBQ pork puff pastry (#33) ($5.80) - BBQ pork anything is good in my books. These were satisfyingly good. Slightly sweeter than the cha sui bao.

- Rice noodle wrapped with pork & shrimp (#39) ($6.80) - these were AMAZING. I've never had these type of rice noodle rolls before. Absolute heaven. Order this for sure! That crunch inside the rice roll is like you're eating a hybrid spring and rice roll, all wrapped into one delicious bite.

- Pumpkin congee with lily & corn (#43) ($5.80) - another first trying pumpkin congee. The flavour is pretty subtle to begin with but it actually grew on me after having another bowl. I'd try it if you like jook and want to try something a little different.

We had a couple boxes of leftovers to eat later on in the afternoon. Overall, the dim sum was good. More pricey than your normal outing but hey, sometimes you gotta treat yo' self."}
{"text":"Since there's already so many reviews here, I'll keep it short. 

Didn't make it to early bird so paid full price for each dish. Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 2:30 pm. Place was still bustling with people, near full house. Their menu items are slightly different then the items you'd find in other dim sum places. I think they're going for the higher end version of dim sum so it makes sense that it's pricier and the names of the dishes sounds fancier. I loved their siu mai, the sticky rice dumpling (very addictive!) and the crispy taro dumpling. (love taro!). I highly recommend these 3 dishes. Their squash congee was pretty bland though. It was light orange but barely has any taste. 

Our bill came out to be $100 for tax and tip and the food fed 5 hungry females (we'd like to think we have average appetites? :)"}
{"text":"Good place, but lacking in dim sum options.

Generally I like variety in the dim sum menu. This place doesn't have that luxury, hence the 4 stars. Still delicious though, although I don't like the siu mai as much...the caviar is too mushy.

Also, the place is MUCH smaller than I thought. Looking from outside, it seems like it's quite big. NOPE! Hence why one has to wait after 11:30am or so."}
{"text":"They DO NOT open at 9am on Mon-Fri. It is 10am!!! And prices here are rather pricey! And they do not have early bird special here.  

S : $3.10
M : $4.30
L : $5.30
XL : $6.30

They also have two other restaurants which they do open at 9am with the early bird special! 

The environment here pretty nice, elegant, and clean.

The food here are actually pretty good! I love the chern fun (steam rice noodle roll) the best. The steam rice noodle part was made fresh and smooth."}
{"text":"I read through the reviews with a fine-toothed comb before dining in Crown Princess, and it made the experience a lot better. I'm familiar with Chinese dim-sum places because I've been to far too many to count, so the hectic atmosphere and frazzled waitresses don't ruffle my feathers. My friend and I arrived around 11 am on Sunday, and there was no line-up and a lot of empty tables. However, at around 12, the line-up stretched all the way outside and the noise level in the restaurant gradually increased. 

This restaurant has such an over-the-top opulence that makes you wonder if you're in Versailles or merely a Chinese dimsum restaurant, and I love that about them. The marble pillars make you feel like a princess roaming around in her velvet-carpeted castle, waiting to be served her pot of tea. We ordered a couple of dim-sum dishes, and I find that around 5-6 dishes will fill up two people. They don't list the price on the order sheet (!!!) but the dishes should be around $3 - $6 each, depending on how expensive the ingredients are.

The food is fantastic! All the dishes we ordered were super tasty. My absolute favourite is the salty egg yolk bun that is NOT salty at all but sweet, creamy and oily. I've tried this dish in a million restaurants, but the ones they make here are slightly crispy on the outside and full of ooey-gooey deliciousness inside. 

The reviews complain about the workers, but I think the waitresses are under a lot of pressure and time-constraints, which is why they speak in such a clipped tone. As well, they have accented English, leading to a seemingly ruder attitude. Other than that, the waitresses were very courteous to our table, refilling our teapot without needing to prompt them and taking away the finished dishes in an efficient manner. This is a fantastic place to impress distant relatives, close friends and potential mother-in-laws!"}
{"text":"Definitely something different in the city, the decor shouts Macau and then it shouts again.

Good Dim Sum brunch"}
{"text":"This is \"fine-dining\" dim sum at it's finest.   Gorgeous decor and the service was excellent, considering we usually don't get this kind of service at a regular Chinese restaurant (and I am all about service when it comes to dining in an area like Yonge & Bloor).   The food is delicious.  Dim sum came out piping hot and fresh.   I guess you really need to know what to order when it comes to giving this place a good rating and trust me, I KNOW my dim sum.  Lolz.   

Best dish:   Shrimp Rice Noodles Rolls - the rice noodle was spongy and shiny, not soggy.   They also went as far as to add a few stems of choy sum in the rolls, which you don't normally see at the other dim sum restaurants.

Something different:   Chicken Sticky Rice (No Mai Gai) - they actually wrapped the leaf in paper and it came out in a rectangular shape instead of the normal square shape.   Delicious because I think with them wrapping it in rice paper, it kept the flavours in.

We decided to splurge a little and order the SPECIAL dishes:  Bird's Nest Dumpling Soup (used to be Shark Fin) and Bird's Nest Custard Tart.   Both were amazing as you can see actual blobs of birds nest on these dishes, instead of merely just giving it the name.

My friend  and I had around 7-8 dishes, a good mixture of Medium, Large, and Special dishes.  Our final bill was $62.00.   A fair price to pay for the type of dishes we ordered and the environment we were in.   If you want cheap dim sum, then go to China Town."}
{"text":"The main attraction here is definitely the decor. From the ruffles cascading down the waitresses' uniforms to the rococo-esque grand ballroom that is the actual restaurant (waterfall paintings, corinthian columns, faux victorian teapots, louis XV chandeliers, you name it), nothing here is underdone. The great news is that this place is more than just a gimmick as the food really is very tasty. They carry certain dim sum that I'm fairly sure you wouldn't necessarily find anywhere else, such as the foie gras & caviar siu mai. They also have the more standard dim sum items, which are all clearly done with a lot of care. It is worth mentioning that the price is a tad higher than other dim sum places and you can easily expect to wait 30 minutes on the weekend."}

Petition to bring back the early bird special!!!! anyone with me?"}
{"text":"Whoa, reading the various reviews about people consistently being overcharged is super disconcerting. We were in last night for a late Chinese New Year eve dinner. Pretty terrible experience all around. The staff were nice, but we didn't come to make friends, we came to eat.

And I wish we hadn't. The place was a disaster. I get it, it's a busy night, but this was beyond the pale. Plates and dinnerware were dirty with crusted food on them, glassware was greasy, food came at a decent pace but with missing ingredients (which are key for the auspicious foods for new year's eve). The food itself was either bland or super salty. Basically a let down for a year end meal. Any random place in Chinatown is preferable.

Maybe this place is ok on a regular night? However, when we asked for the bill they brought us a random bill that said: Lobster for $158. The server blamed the cashier lady for screwing up the bill, but assured us that the 4 plates (we didn't order or eat lobster) and drinks we ordered added up to that sum. I'm not disputing that this is the case as the dishes were jacked up like crazy in price cuz of the holiday, but given other reviews about billing practices this is sketchy af.

We paid because we wanted to leave. Definitely leaves a bad taste both literally and figuratively.

Will avoid like the plague in the future."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the set dinner for 10. Excellent, courteous service. Very fancy decor and place settings. Standouts were the Peking Duck, Duck meat wrapped in lettuce, snow pea/fish maw dish, mango fried rice. Parking in the attached complex was $5 and convenient."}
{"text":"My opinion has always been heavily biased under the influence of marble walls and crystal chandeliers. Oh yes - even for brunch. Indeed, you can't help but enjoy your meal when you're served and surrounded in opulence. 

My favorite dishes were the almond pancakes and meat & veg bun.  Overall the dim sum was pretty good but the early bird discount and decor did a lot for this rating. The food is worthy of a repeat visit, but I'm kind of amazed that there are not more pictures on here of the decor, which easily upstages everything else. 

Arrive early and enjoy the royal treatment for a pauper's price!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after being turned off by Dynasty's default 25% tip.  Overall, we weren't impressed by the food.  Too much sauce, too much Msg, Luke warm dishes left us very disappointed.  We ordered a jumbo dish, sticky fried rice, at $11, it was cold and tasted unfleshed, portion size was barely enough for two.  I find the portion size at this place to be tiny.  Overall would prefer dynasty to this place, but service was good.  Hence the two star."}
{"text":"Overall experience: Good dim sum but not worth the awful, unprofessional service received.  Grandiose-looking furniture/setting, gaudy china certainly DOES NOT equal \"fine dining\".  Perhaps bad luck with unprofessional waitress, M-na.  

Details of experience below:

I went to today (Sunday 1pm) Crown Princess based on the reviews posted on Yelp.  The dim sum was pretty good.  Unfortunately, the good dim sum did not reflect for the awful service my party received.  One of our tea cups were dirty so our waitress, M-na took it away but forgot to replace it.  She was too busy chatting with other tables.  

She either placed our food incorrectly or the kitchen sent us an incorrect order.  When we politely told Mina that there was an error, there was not apology for the mix up. She simply said \"Oh, so you don't want this?\" rather rudely.  She then took our dim sum sheet and incorrect dish away without an apology for the error at all.  

Our rice noodle wraps did not come with a bottle of soya sauce.  When we asked M-na for a bottle, she seemed annoyed and hastily grabbed a bottle from the uncleaned table beside us, whose party just left.  How inconsiderate was that!?  She then continued to chat with other tables within our vicinity.  Our tea was not re-filled in a timely manner either due to her unprofessional attitude.  Our plates were never changed even though we had small mounds of leftover food on them.  Someone from their pantry department offered to take the plates away but never returned with the replacements or notified M-na.

Certain dishes also did not arrive. So when we asked M-na to cancel those dishes, she assumed we wanted to bill too.  However, our table was still filled with uneaten dishes.   A polite, professional waiter/waitress would have at least offered to pack our dishes.

When we told M-na that we were disappointed with her service. She was indifferent and only said \"Sorry\" and walked away.  She did not even care to ask why.

I can assure you that my party consisted of sensible, professional, well-mannered individuals.  The restaurant wasn't even that busy.  The manager offered 10% off our bill but we will not return.  I did not pay a premium for \"fine dining\" only to be served something \"cold\" in return.  Better or comparable dim sum restaurants are available and I suggest Yelpers go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Significant improvement to the last few visits.  The pumpkin and corn congee (our usual staple there) was very pumpkin-y, thick, luscious and luxurious.

Curry cuttlefish - tender, not overcooked, fell apart ... 

Steamed lamb - UNBELIEVABLY divine.  Gently steamed lamb which you can dip in to chili paste.  Exceptionally good, mmmmm.

Zen vegetarian dumplings - average.  Thin wrappers, though, which is a good thing.  Mushroom filling missed something.

Tea - good.  Service - immaculate.  I am glad I went back there today."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in downtown Toronto. Delicious and quality Dim Sum that I have trouble to find in Downtown Toronto.

This restaurant is brand new, the decor is very French and Victorian-ish. The price is on the high-end side. Lunch special runs from $15 and up. 

Most of the regular menu runs from $10 to $20 per dish. 

I was there for this before 11am Dim Sum promotion. Dim Sum size S,M, L are all $3.10 per dish. I really can't imaging what's the regular price after 11am. The food is definitely speaks of quality.

I would definitely come back here again.. before 11am :)"}
{"text":"My party of 4 had a craving for Dim Sum early  Sunday afternoon, arrived at 1100. They were about 4 other parties eating early.

Was immediately seated, staff were attentive and efficient.  We ordered approximately 8-10 dishes which arrived with the normal waiting time.  You can tell the dishes were cooked to order as they arrived steaming hot and fresh.

Strange setting for Dim Sum with chandeliers, columns, purple velvet seats and fine China (?) table settings, maybe they were expecting the Royal family to drop by for some chicken feet.

The place filled up quickly in the next hour, I can see why the negative reviews on service as the staff seemed overwhelmed by the crowd, needed to wave frantically to get their attention.

Great place to take a date or to impress out town guests as long as you are not in a rush"}
{"text":"This is my maybe my third time at Crown Princess. So it's definitely good enough to warrant return business, but the visits have been spaced out over a period of years. It's beautifully decorated with nice dishes, as most reviewers have noted. The servers are dressed up elegantly and bilingual or even trilingual. 

The dim sum is great and fresh with generous portions. You can custom order your tea! However, I feel the menu is limited. But I suppose if they can make a few things great, then keep with that! I am not a big fancy dealie person when it comes to dim sum. I do prefer the old school carts that are pushed around. 

The decorations do not make up for a lack of bedside manners. I just went today with a girl friend, and we were starving, so we ordered a lot of food. The servers kept mentioning it. Initially it was fine because it seemed like the staff wanted to make sure that we knew how much we were ordering. But they kept mentioning it throughout our meal. 

Also some of our orders were late and didn't come until the end of the meal. When I tried to make sure if it was being cooked and if it wasn't, I could just cancel the order since we were almost finishing eating as could be seen by our empty plates. The guy pressured me to keep it and was not very nice about it. Maybe he was just distracted. IDK.

The summary is the food is great with limited choices. I love that you can choose your tea (no hipster teas, okay? More like jasmine, oolong, chrysanthemum, etc.) The restaurant is aesthetically pleasing, but the atmosphere is rushed and the servers need to be more mindful of customers wants and needs without being rude."}
{"text":"Recommended to try: Foie Gras and Caviar Sui Mai (so that you can understand my point)

This is a funny dim-sum place: a Chinese restaurant with the decor that reminds you of medieval France.  Just like its decor, the dishes served here seemed to also have suffered identity crises: even the classics were different from what you would expect, everything was much too tapered to be called dim sum.

It's certainly possible to marry fine-dining and dim-sum, but unfortunately, Crown Princess did not succeed in doing so.  They managed to bring a lot of French luxuries onto the plates, but did nothing to infuse them with the main dish itself.  I would like to illustrate my point with their famous \"Foie Gras and Caviar Sui Mai\".  The sui mai itself was in fact very good, it had a lot of strong flavours; however, the foie gras and the caviar were literally placed on top of the sui mai, and offered nothing to the dish other than the fact that the dish had two classic French delicacies.  Rick Bayless once said: \"you can shave truffles over a dish and call it special, but it's not; it's just expensive\", and I felt very much the same way with the usage of foie gras and caviar here (and at Morimoto's in fact...).

Everything else was similarly boring and uninteresting.  The turnip cakes were almost watery and tasted like detergent.  

Service was very good, but quite a few plates and cups had food residues on them, which was surprising given their over-the-top attempt to appear high-end.  Also, in contrast with the decor, the customers are the very typical Chinese crowd you would find at a hole-in-a-wall dim-sum joint, so definitely don't bother dressing up.

This is definitely a place that I would bring my white friends who've never had real dim-sum before, but it honestly does not taste very good, and many dishes were lacking focus.  Everything had a dim-sum facade, but was missing the soul and essence of HKese cooking.

I recommend Lai Wah Heen for a real fine-dining dim-sum experience."}
{"text":"I've never seen such a swanky appearing dim sum spot. My friend lives across the street and suggested that we pop our heads in for Sunday afternoon dim sum. We were seated quickly but the staff was not the politest or the fastest. He and I split the foie gras and caviar siu mai, har gow, shrimp crepe (cheong fun), and taro mushroom puffs. Sadly skipped dessert so I cannot comment on their egg tarts. 

Grab a group and go one morning after drinking. Steam your hungover face in some hot Jasmine tea while you chat about what happened the night before. I wish I could give this place a higher rating but we had to ask for many items multiple times. Overall pretty decent otherwise, paid $15 per had for four dishes and tea. Would return if their service improves."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on 7/23/17. The service and food was great. Inside was mind-blowing, unbelievable. I have never been in a place like this before. This restaurant deserves 5 STARS just for the aesthetics IMO. I thought I was in a French King Louis movie. The place is pricey but worth a try at least once."}
{"text":"Despite the reviews just know that the portions are not huge, they are average sized.  Service was okay overall.  Quality was decent but not too far off from dim sum places at 1/3 the price.  There's like one small item on the whole menu, really no point to doing that so expect medium and up and even mediums are rare. $1.60 cash grab, I mean 'tea charge' per person.  Went to a shawarma place afterwards."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the dim sum here and there is a good menu of other dishes. Always busy especially for Sunday brunch and holidays. Service is fast and prices are reasonable. Good spot for a group because they have large round tables which will accommodate families or large parties. Easy walk along Bay St from the Manulife Centre."}
{"text":"This is good food. Weird setting, like fake European Versailles but at least the food was great! I want this this to exist in Montreal already!"}
{"text":"We usually come here for dim sum whenever our out-of-town friends are visiting, because who wouldn't want to have dim sum like a royal?  The restaurant is gorgeous, marble walls, high ceiling, elegant columns, fancy dishes, chandeliers everywhere, even the washroom has chandeliers!  The dim sum comes out fast and taste good.  The service is just ok, the staff is not very attentive and doesn't smile often.  The experience would be even better if the service was friendlier."}
{"text":"My favourite dimsum place in the Downtown Toronto region. Prices are on the higher end of the spectrum but I personally think is worth it for the taste and cleanliness.

Everything I've tried on the menu is pretty good. They have all the classic dishes (ha gow, siu mai etc) as well as some unique ones.

The ambiance is more quiet and calm - there are no yelling asian ladies or rolling carts so depending on what type of experience you are looking for, Crown Princess does not offer the typical raucous atmosphere. 

This is the place to take parents / visiting friends / your Caucasian friends who want to try dim sum for a decent / safe dim sum experience in DT Toronto."}
{"text":"It was the night before our big Chinese New Years dim sum extravaganza that we read in the paper that Crown Princess was canceling their early bird discount. The \"Shucks!\" that we cried ensemble could have been heard for miles, but then we also collectively let out a sigh of relief immediately when we realized that we were no longer going to wake up extra early in the morning in order to get a big table during an expected busy time at this newly uber-popular dim sum den.

The type of regal decor (complete with cosplay-like but serious uniforms) in this place is what you would only be able to find in suburbs that are 87% populated by Chinese people like Richmond, BC. Although we didn't have to make the trip there, we sure couldn't tell that we weren't there from looking around the room at the clientele.

It's all well and good that Crown Princess feels much cleaner than most Chinese restaurants downtown and even has some serious style, but what is most important here is that the food is darn good. The dumplings, buns, balls, and what-have-yous were all dainty and flavourful as they were meant to be. After the meal, I also didn't feel parched and slightly sick (from the MSG and salt that is liberally added at many other Chinese restaurants in an effort to make up for the quality that is often lacking). Besides, split between the six of us, the bill was comparatively larger than if we had gone somewhere on Spadina, but didn't actually break the bank at all."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this place so went today for an early lunch. I went by myself but felt comfortable. The service was good.

As far as the food goes, I really liked it. I am not a dim sum expert nor am I a novice - I just order what I like. 

1.Fried octopus tentacles - they were really good. I like them chewy.
2. Shrimp & veggie flat noodles - these were very good. Two plump shrimp and the sauce that came with it was yummy.
3. Shrimp shu mai - this is my all time fave dim sum item! I really liked the dish here.
4. Scallop shu mai - loved this dish! There were four dumplings filled with scallops and decorated with black sesame seeds and some fish eggs. YUMMY!
5.Turnip cake - another dish I always order. This was also very good. I hate greasy fried food but this was not greasy at all. 

The total with tax and tip (20% tip) came out to $38. It was only for 1 person so it is a bit expensive. The one thing I didn't like was that they charged me for tea! I hate it when they do this/.

Overall I give this a 4 out of 5. It is very close to where I work. So if I am ever craving dim sum early in the day (they open at 10 am!) I will definitely visit Crown Princess."}
{"text":"You know that annoying friend who is always bragging about the god-forbidden delicacies he has eaten while abroad in Asia?

Crown Princess Fine Dining is your chance to get back at him while keeping your stomach happy. 

Quality of food: All in all, very satisfactory. No MSG funny business or too much oil and sauce. 
Make sure to try out all the delicacies. 

Décor: Nouveau riche, baby. 

The decor is probably the most salient feature of the restaurant. It is an interesting cultural experience if you don't frequent Asia. It is actually very typical of modern Cantonese restaurants- think Victorian opulence intersecting new money Asia. Make sure to take a look at the bathroom decor. The 18th century paintings of European aristocrats will probably leave you feeling extremely perplexed. Anyway, back to food. 

Price: Lunch sets are affordable. Though the dimsum plates don't seem expensive, they are small, and it really adds up. Lunch would be $20s, dinner around $50s. 

Ambience: Lots of clinking of tea, and plates, relatively quiet. Could be mistaken a place for British high tea, but wait, it's an Asian restaurant. Once again, you sit down and you are a bit confused. 

Service: The servers can be a bit patronizing sometimes, especially when there are a lot of customers. Interesting observation, all the female servers are dressed like French maids. Where am I?... 

Favourite dish: Egg pudding with sparrows nest/ spit. It sounds disgusting, but this basically is the Asian equivalent of truffles. The egg pudding is also baked perfectly with soft crust and mouthwatering filling. 

Insider tip: Though the $18 lunch sets are for one person, I find it more than enough for two people. It includes 3 courses and a dessert. Such great value."}
{"text":"I enjoyed dim sum at the Crown Princess a couple of times. Half of the dim sums were among the best I ever enjoyed. The other half of the dim sums were very good. Overall this place is closer to 5 than 4 stars. Impressive European decor. Very clean. Service ranged from good to excellent. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Probably my expectation was too high for this. I think the food there is just ok. But I would like to give higher rank for interior decoratio"}
{"text":"Food taste good!  It's solid good dim sum here.  I especially like the xo sauce tried rice rolls, xo sauce steam scallop rice rolls, and durian puff.  

However, the service is bad here.  The same people I see every time but they look angry, unfriendly, they don't greet you as a returning customer.  Pretend they don't know you. 

Given the price point is considered one of the most expensive dim sum place in the city, with bad service. They only worth 3 stars because of the food. 

If you go on weekend, try call ahead to make reservations, walk it can be a hour long line up and wait time.  

Also there is no free parking, have to do paid parking on street or parking lot around there. It's on Bay Street though, a ttc bus stop is right in front of it if you are not driving."}
{"text":"Considering it was a Saturday and I entirely forgot all about reservations, we were in for an inevitable wait. After about 30 min, they called us in and showed us to our table. 

We immediately got to ordering our staple dim sum dishes. First of all, before I go to the positives... The service was below average. I wished that they were more patient... and smiled a little more. They were really busy with other tables too but their attitude should not have reflected from that. 

As for the food, everything was perfect. The siu mai was plump and juicy with a subtle hint of caviar. The har gow contained a huge chunk of shrimp meat. It also was juicy and savoury. I particularly enjoyed chewing on the chicken feet waiting for more dishes to arrive. The scallop dumplings were quite interesting. You could really taste the scallop! 

I think what stood out the most was the milk tart. IT WAS THE BEST MILK TART EVER. it was flaky, buttery and contained a sweet creamy custard filling. One bite of it and it instantly melted in my mouth. It was amazing. Love it!"}
{"text":"We went for Sunday dim sum and I have to say I was seriously impressed.  The decor is a little over the top with marble.  The sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf and pan fried beef ribs are dim sum staples for me and were both excellent.  The pan fried chive shrimp and fried sticky dumpling with chicken were also great.  The service was fast and pleasant in French maid garb.  The prices are quite reasonable.  We will definitely be back.  It's busy on Sunday so come early."}
{"text":"Stopped by because I heard good things about dimsum in Toronto. It's not that the food was bad. On the contrary, it was actually very delicious. However, the price and the bad service was what made the experience pretty bad. A lot of the dishes were overpriced (nearly triple the price of a regular dimsum dish). Sure they have some unique and more pricey ingredients that they use in some of their dishes but we did not get any of those and it was still about 7 dollars for a tiny dish. 

It took us forever to order because we kept calling the waiters over and they looked at us and didn't even come over to help. Only one waiter was nice enough to come back over and over again to take our order and bring our food. (how do they expect a tip for service like this)

In the end we only ordered about 3 dimsum dishes, one congee, and a rice dish and it was over a hundred dollars. A pot of tea is $11 (insane..) and it came up to over $20 for one person in a group of six. 

To make things even worse, there was one dish that we had to continuously ask about because it took forever to come. And then they had the nerve to charge us twice for that dish. We had to argue with the cashier for her to remove the item from our bill.

We were not even full at the end of this and we ended up going to McDonalds to fill ourselves up..

BEWARE: if you decide to eat here, make sure to check the receipt in case they try to charge you for something you didn't order."}
{"text":"Crown Princess Fine Dining is tough to categorize...a marble palace, Crown Princess tries to be all things to all people. 

Cute Dim Sum dumplings are a specialty, although flavours are sometimes \"refined\" to the point of blandness. 

Lunch specials tempt the gwai lo, emphasizing sweet more than savoury. They're pricy at $15 or more  (especially given the downscale versions available nearby), but a decent amount of well-prepared food.

A full dinner menu goes full Sinophile; treasures from the sea, organ meats and all. Well-executed, but nothing memorable. 

Service is beyond polite; suited and dressed, all chair-pulling and napkin-folding and noodle portioning. If only they wouldn't dissuade me from ordering items that \"white people don't like\". 

Culturally speaking, I like organ meats. 

Where do you think the expression \"what am I, chopped liver?\" comes from?"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE dim sum with friends, but not my family. Why? My mom orders the SAME dish every. single. time. It goes something like this: 
Me: \" Omg, this sounds really good! Can we try this??\"
Mom: ''-Who's- the one paying?'' or \"It's not worth it\"
My mind: \"WHY do i even bother?\" -Sigh-

On the other hand with my friends....

Me: \"YO, let's try this!''                                                 
Friends: ''YEAHHHH MAN, LET'S GET THAT TOO!''     

So, I haven't been to dim sum in awhile now, but I read about this place and I wanted to try it out so me and my two other friends went here at freakin' 9:40 am. NOTE: I have NEVER EVER EVER in my life been to dim sum this early. I -always- go after 12pm, but if you ORDER before 11am, S,M,L dishes are all $3.10. It was really quiet when we got there and my friend hadn't eaten dim sum in awhile either and absolutely loves it so just GUESS how many goddamn dishes we ordered. The bill came out to be $70 with tax and tip. You do the math.

Equation: [(1313-13)/13] - 87 = _ _ 

I KNOW RIGHT. THAT IS AN INSANE NUMBER OF FOOD TO ORDER BETWEEN ONLY 3 PEOPLE. The waitress literally smiled as she delivered each dish and kept coming back. I bet she was thinking \"3 teens ordering that many dishes? Bitches better have enough $$\" LOL. So anyway, all the dishes were really light and not full of msgs. 

                            M e m o r a b l e   D i s h e s 
1.  Baked BBQ pork puff pastry - (One of my favorites. The crust is light and flaky and tthe barbeque pork was just flavourful. Perfect little bites.) 

2. Tripe - (Classic asian dish and it was light and scrumptious. The texture was delicious, some chewiness accompanied with bursts of juice.)

3. Chicken Congee - The congee was naturally sweet as the chicken had been sitting in the congee for awhile. This was an excellent dish to warm up in the winter time and the flavours were just naturally enhanced by the chicken and choy.

D O   N O T  order the Birds Nest Egg Tart. There was a miniscule amount of birds nest. and it was $8. 

The rest was really nothing special to be honest. The other restaurant owned by this owner is a lot better I'd say. Located on Steeles and Warden, it's more convenient for parking and we are known as regulars there too. I don't think I'll be returning here. The decor is way too flashy for me. I swear asians have a thing with making it GOLD and expensive looking. I, however, am not a fan. I guess it's nice once in awhile, but like I said, I have had better! Worth a try though."}
{"text":"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. They cancelled the Early Bird dim sum deal! I am completely gutted. I called to make sure and it's true - early bird no more.

Screw you, Crown Princess! LMAO :) Bring it back, because I can't afford to dine here otherwise!"}
{"text":"Came here dim sum on Saturday. Was looking forward to it from all the good reviews. 

My impression of this restaurant is that it is opulent and way over the top. There's marble throughout the restaurant but when you look closer, much is faux marble. Table clothes feels like silk and the dishes is made for the restaurant. There's many chandeliers which makes this place overly decorated. Many find it to be elegant. However, I find it too pretentious for my taste.

Food was above average. I do like the Goose Liver Siu Mai but the caviar does nothing to the taste. Honey Glazed Short Ribs is tasty and the Curry Baby Squid is delicious. The Shark Fin Dumpling in Soup was disappointing. Portions are so off that there's no filling of the dumpling and the soup tastes bland. Fried tentacles should be light golden colour but we got it in dark chocolate colour which means it is over fried. 

Service is horrendous. 1) Manager came to our table when we asked for the Fried Tentacles to be replaced, however she wouldn't obliged saying that we don't know anything about Chinese Dim Sum and says this is how it suppose to be. 2) We asked for a bill. The manager tells me to pay at the cashier meanwhile she's holding the wireless credit card terminal. I asked if I can pay using the terminal, she says this is for VIPs. 3) So I paired my bills at the cashier. Gave them no tip. The cashier lady immediate notice this and chase me down the aisle saying I didn't pay tip and I should pay 10%. I said to her who said?!

Will not come back unless friends and family invited me."}
{"text":"Customer service: BAD
Food Quality: MEH
Price Range: TOO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT THEY OFFER
Overall: I'd rather take my money to Pearl Harbourfront. This place is too shady for a \"fine dining\" restaurant. I did not expect a \"decent\" downtown restaurant to have such bad service.

I live 2 minutes away and my boyfriend and I were craving for dim sum, so we decided to make a visit for brunch. We waited for our first dish for 30 minutes and an extra 20 minutes for the rest to come. We found the food weren't really tasty compared to other dim sum places in Toronto, but each for their own.

So the bill came and we saw that they had charged us $3.20 per person for tea when we did not have any; we only asked for water. Yet when asked the manager said that apparently the water was boiled inside a teapot so they had to charge us the same fee (???). Well if she was to charge us anyway then shouldn't she let us know in the beginning?? 

At the end, we thought their service did not deserve our tips (sorry but there was no smile, no greetings, and not even an apology for the tea mistake), so we only paid the exact amount on the bill and headed out. Then, one waiter chased after us while we were by the door; he yelled at us and claimed that we \"stole the money\" and \"did not pay\". Like excuse me??!!! My boyfriend and I were caught off-guard since we did leave the money inside the bill folder on the table and I saw the manager lady checking the cash too. We were so confused and furious about the way he screamed at us like we were some scums trying to run away. We went back and showed him that the bill folder containing the money was in fact on the freaking table. Apparently he didn't open the bill folder and thought we were dining and dashing.

This experience ruined our perfect Sunday. Save your precious time and money and go somewhere else where customers are treated with respect."}
{"text":"Tried a second time for dim sum. Left once seated which is exceptional for me. Worst and unfriendliest service and usher ever met in my life. There is a limit in how bad and unfriendly a chinese restaurant can be.  Work on this!"}
{"text":"Visiting from NY. Looking for a place with parking to have dinner around 5pm so we looked up this place (friend recommended Crown \"Prince\" but yelp came up with this and it was much closer so we gave it a try. 

The outside looked close but one door was wide open. There was no one but a large take out order. Got seated and given menus. The utensils and plates and pots look nice but up close they were very faded and old. Service was a bit slow and the waiter and waitress didn't come check on us to take our order until we asked them about 15 min after being seated. 

We ordered about 4 dishes and two apps for the four of us. (see pictures). The food was not bad. Sweet and sour ribs were the best but not enough meat on the bones. 

Very little crab meat on the asparagus and the satay beef with vermicelli casserole was way too sweet and not good. 

Dishes were somewhat smaller than expected. In ny the dishes usually have more meat...

Overall 3 star is being very conservative but the waiter was somewhat talkative and nice."}
{"text":"We went to Crown Princess at Bay and Wellesley for Thanksgiving dim sum. It was recommended by a friend and I wanted to try it. Since it was downtown partner with the fact that it's a holiday this place was packed. There was 13 of us so luckily we made reservations a week in advance.  Before 11 am there's dim sum specials but after 11 am it goes back to full price. This place is sooo expensive. Image your typical dim sum place in Chinatown and double the price. The portions are the same size as your typical dim sum place not any bigger. $8 for crab claw OMG what a rip off. Ok the decor was nice and looks like a banquet hall but not worth the price. As a comparison we had 13 people and the bill came to $450.  If you go to Chinatown for 13 people at most the bill would be around $150-$200. The food didn't taste any better. Even the crab claw tasted the same nothing special.  I think people go for the ambiance. I definitely would not come back and waste my money here. The service was terrible. You had to ask for things a few times and they still manage to leave one item out and you have to ask again.  For that type of service give me Chinatown any day!"}
{"text":"Hmm...I'm surprised I have not written a review for this place before. We dont come here that often, but we do come every once in a while. It's one of the fancier dimsum places, as one can tell easily by the pics and the reviews, and the price reflects it. If you come for early bird, i think it's  much cheaper, but i can never wake up for early bird.

i dont think the dimsum here is that much better than non-fancy dimsums (or even better?), which is likely why i never even remember to write a review for this place. I dont think it's worth the price it charges, but i suppose if you are an old asian who wants to go with your friends or family to something nice during dimsum time, this can be a good option. No push-cart, unsurprisingly."}
{"text":"We ate two types of fried rice and chicken dishes. All on the table agreed it was probably the best Chinese food we ate outside China. Delicious food, upscale ambience (though it's very brightly lit). Service was great except they got my soup after getting some of the mains!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Sunday morning for dim sum and it was crowded, but there were still a few tables open.  I have to say that for a business that calls themselves \"fine dining\", they have definitely missed the marks on their customer service!  The waiter barely came to our table to take our drink order.  We had to wait for awhile and then flag him down to get some tea.  The food was decent, but expensive for what you get.  However, I would come back for the food if the service was better.

We ordered 6 dishes, but our last dish never came out.  We waited for awhile to get our last dish, but had some other appointment to go to, so we again had to flag out waiter down.  This time the manager came, and his annoyed response was, \"what do you want, miss?!\"  Seriously?!  This is the response we get for asking if our last dish was coming?  I politely explained to him that our last dish was still not here, and if it will take too long, we will just pay for our food and have to take off for an appointment.  He had nothing to say to us and left, came back with the bill a few minutes later.

As I said, the food was decent, but I would not come back here as the customer service was very poor!  I expected more from a fine dining restaurant.  I probably get better customer service at a fast food chain!"}
{"text":"Over priced dim sum! They are better than average but not sure if it's worth the extra money you pay for dim sum."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday because of the location and because of the memories that I had there. I've been there a couple of times and I enjoyed it every one. The food were very authentic and service was okay. The restaurant is on the expensive side of the spectrum for sure: two of us spent 72 dollars tips included without ordering anything particularly expensive."}
{"text":"3 stars for dim sum + 0.5 star for services and deco + 0.5 star for Early Bird Special.

My experience of Crown Princess Fine Dining is based on the $3.10 Early Bird Dim Sum Special. I am quite value driven so I am happy to pay $3.10 for the dim sums S/M/L sizes but if I would have pay full prices then it will be a much harsher review.

I have to say that the deco and the services here are both excellent! The waitstaffs are everywhere. There are even at least 4 managers working on the floor to make sure everything run smoothly. 

Hot water always refilled for the teapot, dishes always cleared right after we finish eating, the waitstaffs are all nice/young/polite.

The dim sums we ordered are all good (comparable to the dim sum quality at Richmond Hill/Markham) and nicely presented. We enjoyed everything we ordered, except the Deep Fried Fresh Fruit Dumplings - Not only it is way too oily (dripping in oil, we have to use our napkins to soak it up before we dare to eat that) and it is stuffed with bananna, apple and mayo.. hmmm yuck!

I would suggest making a reservations if you do come and it is so nice to able to make a reservations instead of waiting in line for a table.

Parking are free on Sundays, just bring your parking slips they will stamp it for you!

If you want the dim sum specials, you need to order before 11:00 AM Monday-Sunday and is Cash only!

If you are in the area, I would suggest you drop by but making a special trip from the Suburbs may not be worth it!"}
{"text":"I've come here a number of times since it is close to my work. I have to say that it is a pretty good spot. Some of the dishes are really tasty, some not as much. It is meant to be fine dining - the service could be a bit better a lunch at times, but overall a good experience. Recommend if you are into dim sum - they do have some fried and other dishes on hand as well in case you aren't the biggest dim sum fan."}
{"text":"The shark fin soup which is one of their specials was tasty but a bit salty for my taste. It wasn't that hot anymore when they served it. There's not a lot of dimsum places that I've tried in TO but this is one of the better ones. The service was really slow though and the place is cramped. This is not really a fine dining restaurant. The interior is a bit extravagant compared to other dimsum places but food is always more important to me than the ambiance. Their prices are a bit steep compared to other places but it's still worth a try. So far, I liked everything that I ordered, just not the green tea flavoured cake with red bean. I should always be reminded not to order desserts from chinese restaurants, they surely aren't experts of it."}
{"text":"I love this place , nice guy ,fine food, not so many people around there. The manger I guess that he's from Hong Kong always friendly. We always could get free desert , and 10%discount if we pay cash you know. 
I love Beijing roast duck, even it's not descent meaningful Beijing roast duck. I am a beijinger very proud of where come I from. It always get my homesick when I eat ."}
{"text":"Overall, too pricey for what you get and that's hit or miss dim sum with mediocre portions but quality ingredients. Very ncie atmosphere though. Food breakdown below:

Good:

The jumbo size sticky rice. It wasn't really that jumbo but it was still good.

Har gow- lots of shrimp goodness

Shrimp rice roll- lots of shrimp and some spinach as well. Pretty good.

Okay:

BBQ Pork rice roll- Meh. Typical.

Beef balls- Typical.

Shrimp and scallop dumpling. Quality ingredients but bland taste.

Avoid:

Chrysanthemum and Lychee jelly - too sweet and lacking qualtiy ingredients. Yuck.

Chicken congee- I feel as if they prepared it in a blender. I'm not sure who their target audience but it's surely not people looking for authentic chinese.

Vegetable and pork chiu chow dumpling- just didn't taste like anything special. Typical fair. Love it or hate it kind of food."}
{"text":"The least flavorful dim sum I have ever had ever. We are from California, so I know dim sum is a way of life and this just wasn't making the cut in any way. The congee was bland, shrimp tasted like water, bbq pork didn't taste like anything. The goose liver and caviar shumai tasted rotten with no caviar taste. 

No line on a Saturday morning should be the give away. The bean curd taste like steamed veggies with no delicious flavor or richness. The octopus and the veggie dumpling were the only redeeming things and we ordered a ton! 

I've never had to look for salt at a Chinese food or dim sum place. 

This place doesn't do the cart dim sum so you don't really know what you're getting and it all comes out pretty much at once. 

Definitely skip this, it's supposed to be a fancy dim sum but it isn't even as good as cheap at night dim sum places."}
{"text":"This place was pretty damn good. 

I really enjoyed the atmosphere and decor. Unlike most other Asian places, this place had some really nice fine China that all matched up. The waiters and waitresses were all dressed up and there were many people there dining with their families and friends. 

The food there was made very fresh and they definitely overloaded their har gao and siu mai with a lot of meat - which was great. I also tried their puff pastry BBQ eel, which wasn't that great. 

However, the fact that they charged tea per person rather than just per tea pot was not a highlight. Neither were the banana leaves and sticky rice, which skimped hard on any meat. 

If you have the money and want to go to a very expensive upscale restaurant then I will definitely recommend this place. However, if you want something that is more bang for your buck, I would recommend Rol San instead."}
{"text":"I definitely felt like an out-of-place street urchin within the splendour and opulence that is Crown Princess Fine Dining. There are walls lined with onyx, a velveteen damask carpet, fine tablecloths (I'm used to plastic at dim sum), behemoth marble columns and more chandeliers than Casa Loma. With each bite I knew I was on the verge of being thrown out.

But in stark contrast to all this pomp and grandeur, is their stunning dim sum discount (and the reason we all were there). Before 11am items on the menu are between $3.10 to $6 with most things skewing towards the cheap. Not ones to complain about a good deal, me and eleven trusty yelpers cozied around the restaurant's largest table and set to work.

The service is fairly brisk here. Instead of carts, it's a la carte and the food is brought out by waitresses in French maid outfits. I'm not a dim sum expert by any meals, but I loved everything I ate here and even tried some things I've never tried before. The presentation is dramatically wonderful, culminating in the dessert: a mango mousse shaped like a fish. It was an enjoyable experience, everyone was truly stuff and the damage was something like 12.50 per person. Amazing!

Obligatory Title Pun: CROWNing achievement.

Menu Readability: Standard dim sum check-boxes on carbon paper.

Need to mention: We ordered 2.9 items per person and we were stuffed.

What this place teaches me about myself: I should really hold my sweet sixteen at this place."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to having dim sum here since we live so close and heard great things about it. The lineup was very long, so we waited half an hour to get seated; reservations seem to be key here. We grabbed a menu in advance to expedite our order while in line. Ended up with a table in this cold room where other diners were wearing their Canada goose coats during their meal. Service was average. This place is huge so it took a while to get servers to come by our little corner. The food was great, I would say above average for dim sum, and was served quickly. We had the har gow, sticky rice, tripe, taro balls, pork and shrimp rice rolls, and pumpkin congee. Overall this place was great to try out for a first time but not worth waiting again for dim sum, unless we had reservations. I still prefer other places like Dim Sun King and Noble, if they weren't so far."}
{"text":"The decor of this place would make Liberace blush.  I found some of the staple items to be good - for example the har gow.  Several dishes were a bit on the bland side, though they were all fresh tasting.  1 star rating is due partly to CP's decision to offer shark fin on the menu.  Possibly the most ecologically disasterous food, and unbelievably cruel to boot.  May as well serve panda eyelids.  Won't be back while that's on the menu."}
{"text":"After experiencing Crown Princess for the first time, I have to say that I am having a tough time reviewing it.  So let me break it down into the good, the bad, the ugly:

The good:
The food is great, particularly its dim sum offerings.  Though it does serve the regular dim sum favourites -- steam dumplings, curried squid, turnip cake etc. -- the quality of the food is better than most of the places I have been to in downtown Toronto.  

The bad:
Yet the service, particularly when it is busy is atrocious!  Granted we came on New Year's Day.  But we had a reservation and still waited 1 hour to be seated (some without reservations with the same number of people were seated quicker!).  Even worse, they sat us at a table that didn't have enough seating for our party.  Perhaps they should give up on reservations if they can't honour them.  Or better yet, go by the number system that they use at other dim sum restaurants so when a number is called patrons have somewhat of an idea how long they are going to wait.

The ugly:
Now everyone mentions the decor as being top notch, but it reminded me of Harrods...extravagance to the point of gaudiness! Yes, they have chandeliers, marble accents, bathroom doors painted in a gilded gold finish, and what looks like velvet draping on the walls... but is this fine dining decor...uh no.  More like a Fendi knockoff wanting to be a Fendi purse!

So is Crown Princess \"fine dining\"?  Perhaps if it works on its service, and tone down the decor it might get there.  But for me, fine dining is not just good food, and fancy decor but good service as well.  Hope they keep trying."}
{"text":"ONE OF THE BEST DIMSUM I HAD. EVER.

Never mind the blinged-out interior and servers dressed in french maid themes for no particular reason. The place is spacious, the menu is expansive, and the dim sums are amazing! 

We ordered egg tarts that came with bird's nest... my favorites were Steamed Scallop & Shrimp Dumpling (#4) and Beef Tripe with XO Sauce (#12). Also liked the pork buns shaped like pig face lol 

Total bill came to be slightly less than $20 per person."}
{"text":"This is my go to Dim Sum place in Toronto. On saturdays I would just roll out of bed and walk to this place to satisfy my weekly morning tea cravings. 

 I couldn't remember some of the good items in English but most of their dishes are quality ( compared to Rol San's substandard dishes). One of my favorite was a cake like  creation with egg yolk filling. Their sausage fried rice was also good for dim sum eating. 

  On weekends this place can get super busy so if you are going with a group past 12 on a Saturday, be prepared to wait. Service is prompt and friendly, the staff are well trained and knows their stuff. For a regular it is reassuring to see familiar faces. 

  Highly recommended for anyone craving for Dim Sum. Hands down one of the best Dim Sum place in Toronto ( beats Rol San and this other place on top of  Dragon City)."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was here until I randomly walked by a few months ago. It's taken us until them to try it out, and it's a must-do! The dim sum is decent (interesting selection) but the decor is AMAZING. So over-the-top. Great service!"}
{"text":"Out of the downtown dim sum places this is by far the best and my favorite. Unlike some chinatown places it is very clean. 
It has crazy decor fancy china and up to recently frilly collared shirts for the staffs. All this makes a very interesting experience. 
Food is great. I have introduced many visitors from all over the world and they are still talking about how good the food is. 
Try the various dumplings. All very good. The beef with Maggi sauce is a most try. The chow mein is a sight to be seen. For dessert have the milk tarts. Always make fresh.
Highly recommended and I go there often.
They do also serve dinner. It is good as well but they excel at their dim sum.  Dim sum is served for lunch 7 days a week"}
{"text":"You can always count on Crown Princess if you are craving good dim sum south of the 401."}
