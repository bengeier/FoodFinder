{"text":"I requested a specialty bread for our family. A recipe that I have not found anyplace else locally. BAKED in the Village made it and it was excellent. The willingness to prepare something that is not part off their regular rotation of selections is almost unheard of these days. Not only did BAKED in the Village step up, but the owner was happy to make it and willing to make it again on order."}
{"text":"Food is fresh. Eggs are real, not poured from some bladder. Decor a little dull but staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Great little place in downtown Kent. All of the staff, including a mother and daughter (Maybe owners?) were extremely friendly and attentive. The soups and sandwiches were very good and the pasteries were phenomenal!!! We took a few to go as we were so full from our lunch. I haven't had baklava that flavorful and delicious in years!! The chocolate croisant and cheese covered pretzel... Yum!!"}
{"text":"Very small place with a quiet atmosphere.  I tried the ham and cheese croissant and it was very good.  They offered my 4 yr old a nice kids selection and he settled in a ham and cheese sandwich.  They even have a bunch of coloring books and crayons for the kids.  I am on my way out now and I'm going to buy some homemade Polish Nut Roll for the road.....fingers crossed."}
{"text":"I went to Baked for the first time today. It has a great atmosphere, the people are efficient and friendly, and the menu is extensive. The prices are good too.  However, I wasn't impressed with the pastries we got. The brownie/cookie was so dry that my goodie loving partner didn't even finish it. The cannoli was good but I've gotten similar at Giant Eagle for a little less. The eclair wasn't as good as the frozen ones at Aldi, the filling is more like instant vanilla pudding than custard and the chocolate topping was way to sweet.   It wasn't terrible and I'd go back again before making a hard decision about the place."}
{"text":"While I do like their food, it is somewhat confusing. They are set up as a restaurant, but will stand there waiting for you to come it the counter to order. I think this place has potential, especially seeing how busy wild goats gets, but needs to figure out their identity. Are you going to be quick serve or a restaurant?  Pick one and run with it. I think they could be slammed as a restaurant though."}
{"text":"Excellent bakery. I've only ever bought baked goods to go, but the staff are very friendly and you can tell everything is made fresh and with a lot of love."}
{"text":"we need more people and places like this in kent....keep it local and not corporate! the owner works hard and the end result is delicious pastries..awesome! you can't find anything half this good anywhere around....support the locals....they deserve it and the quality is the best"}
{"text":"Very good food at a great price. We love the gouda pretzels and kolachi. Casual and relaxed atmosphere with no frills. Just excellent baked goods."}
{"text":"For a very small place, with only one customer before my arrival at lunch time, the service was disappointingly slow. With only two people in my party, even though the order was SLOWLY and carefully written, they still mixed the soups. Offered coffee refill that never came. Never offered a refill on the soft drink. Chicken salad came from a container, not made on site. Not sure about other items, but it seems that most is purchased, not store made. Almost tried to charge even after presenting the Groupon. Purchased brownie was NOT a fudge brownie. I asked first, to be sure. It was a cake brownie, not fudge. Overall, it was lunch. Nothing more."}
{"text":"One word is all you need to know:  Snuggles!  They are the best.  If you are heading to a party, stop by here during the day for some great bread and pastries.  They have some great cannoli, I am told.  But for me it is e snuggles with the nice pastry dough, wrapped around apple filling, drizzled with a great white glaze.  Sandwiches at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Way to go on a delicious gluten free sandwich, Baked!  I think that they use Udi's bread, which can obviously be bought in the supermarket, but if you're downtown looking for a tasty gluten free option, they can make any sandwich using it.  I had the turkey and swiss.  They also offer a nice selection of sides, such as coleslaw and potato salad, but if you're not into the mayo-based dishes, they can also do applesauce.  I would definitely come back if I was hungry and out on errands.  On a Saturday afternoon, the wait was far less tiresome than Wild Goat.    My only slight disappointment?  Their gluten free \"black bean\" brownie.  Alas it was dry and tasted too much of the barely disguised mystery ingredient.  Back to the drawing board on that one."}
