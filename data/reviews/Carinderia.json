{"text":"Great food. It was their first attempt at Kamayan cuisine. Tabletop banana leaf served with fresh rice and seafood. A definite must try.  They also have Halo Halo. A concoction of beans, veggies, condensed milk served with ice for a nice refreshing desert/ beverage."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and authentic. So if you like Filipino food or want to try something new, this place was great! I recommend the kare kare - contrary to the first review - as it was a very good version of the dish. This oxtail stew is supposed to be in a peanut curry sauce and have a savoury and slightly sweet taste."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! I didn't speak Tagalog but my friend did and helped me order some halo-halo. The man that must be the owner gave us a free ube pie to try as well! Only downside was that the halo-halo was a bit expensive. Overall very pleased!"}
{"text":"Service was great and mostly everything we ordered was good...but I wouldn't recommend the Kare kare. It cost $18 for a large order and the serving size was disappointing and, most importantly, the meat was tough and inedible. I don't know how a Filipino restaurant could mess up kare kare, but it happened."}
{"text":"I can't really say anything bad about this place! Everything I (we) ordered was sooo good! And compared to other Filipino restos I've been to in Mississauga, this place is cheaper and still just as good!  I came with my mom and brother. We ordered 3 plates and shared, which was the perfect amount of food. A 2 item plate is about $6-7, it comes with a cup of rice and your choice of two sides. If you're familiar with Filipino food, we got adobo (pork marinated in soy sauce and vinegar), bistek (beef with soy sauce, onion and garlic), crispy pata at $17 (big portion of deep fried pork), laing (taro leaves in coconut milk) and 3 orders of halo-halo for dessert at $6.50 each (shaved ice with condense milk, ice cream, lèche flan, mixed sweet beans)! YUMMM!  Altogether it came up to approximately $60, might seem pricey (which it is) but in comparison to other restos, the price isn't so bad!  If you haven't tried Filipino food yet, what are you waiting for?!?"}
{"text":"Best ever!! A must visit for excellent Philippino food.  Everything on the menu looks amazing.  My fave so far is the Bbq beef rib box and the Lechon Kawali!!"}
{"text":"Ohhh my! Taste like moms. Perfect! I'm writing this as I'm taking my last few bites. I ordered from skipthedishes  The Lugaw was a Friiiiiigen perfect Yellow. with an expected amount of garlic and green onion, A whole lottaaa! The consistency was exactly how my mom taught me.   The Grilled fish ... I liked it . I wished they offered FRIED fish .- not bangus. But something like this fish. But fried..  The vinegar and slaw that was in the container with fish. was pickled- kinda liked it stillllll.   I requested tomato and onion On the side .Was I so happy that they put it in a nice size container.   So yummy in my tummy. I'm really happy after that meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic food at very fair prices. This was my first foray into Filipino food and I've been here twice for lunch within a week. The BBQ pork so far is my favorite. Everything is very high quality and so tasty. The pickle mix is good on literally everything"}
{"text":"I had two item combo. They mix it all together in one plate. (Ginataang isda & pakbet) No food presentation.  puto bungbong was so hard almost like a candy! Why don't you change the name into BATObongbong."}
{"text":"The owner made us feel right at home. Really yummy experience. My favourite was the stuffed calamari w a salsa type filling. We ordered halo halo which reminded me our viet deserts. The owner provided us with a free sample of bubble tea. Very good experience overall. Loved the family style business."}
{"text":"Update: I came back today with my family in the midst of a busy Sunday afternoon crowd. This being a counter-style restaurant, the service was outstanding (someone seating everyone flexibly, hot food orders from the kitchen, and great conversation with the staff). I tried a few new things today: their pancit (Filipino noodles) had a lovely citrusy taste to it reminiscent of calamansi (calamand limes) and fried pieces of pork for salt and texture. Their halo-halo (shaved ice dessert) was spot on! The beans, jelly, ube, and flan tasted fresh against the lightly sweet milk.  Huge improvement on the liempo (pork belly was fresh off the grill), and the pinakbet (shrimp sautéed vegetables) was cooked thoroughly to the point of falling-apart squash. Yum. And of course, I'm still raving about the laing (coconut stewed taro leaves).  Do not pass Carinderia without trying it!  ---  Upon stumbling in here for lunch, the clean and open family style seating was refreshing from other Filipino restaurants, and the industrial/commercial surroundings. Not quite like Little Manila (Wilson and Bathurst).   I was pleasantly surprised by the food here, and especially the ube pie. The server/chef was patient and highlighted the dishes of the day. The food was served on these neat square recyclable plates that held sauces quite nicely. I really appreciated the condiment selection that they made with clear labels for suggested dishes. Furthermore, the menu and posters were well designed. Great daily specials for all day breakfasts (silog style - with eggs and rice), and even a student special for the nearby high school. I was a little sad that the pancakes were only served on Saturday, but I look forward to the mango, ube, and macapuno pancakes they've got!  On to the food: - The rice still had some of the husk on it for a great nutty taste and texture. It won't absorb too much sauce, and keeps its form.  - The laing (stewed taro leaves in a spicy coconut sauce) wasn't too spicy and had great flavoring with the added pork fat and ginger. Also, they used FRESH leaves; I've been eating it with rehydrated leaves for the longest time. So good! - The sisig (gingery, spicy pork) was a little bit more like a variation of kilawin (an oniony, ginger pork). Would have liked different cuts of pork to give it a chewy, crispy texture.  - Pinakbet (shrimp sautéed vegetables) had large pieces of vegetables, but a smaller serving. The bittermelon and squash were still undercooked.  - The liempo (grilled pork belly) had a great flavour but being on the hot table softened the crust and chad of the meat too much.  - The bilo-bilo (stewed pudding of rice cakes, jackfruit, taro, tapioca, and plantain) was delicious. The whole dish was very fragrant of the jackfruit and taro. It was cooked through perfectly.  - THAT. UBE. PIE. The crust had an excellent crumb that wasn't sweet or too salty, to compliment the great textured ube (purple yam pudding). Best I've had in Mississauga by FAR.   Took another pie home to \"share\" and definitely coming back for the pancakes. Great stuff!"}
{"text":"Tip:  Unless you're driving North on Tomken Rd., the lot for this restaurant is a bit tricky to access and it may require a U-Turn of some sort.  I decided to check this place out after a friend said that she wanted to try Filipino cuisine.  I've already been to Berto's, so we decided on Carinderia which is located in the unit of the former Blue Sage, a bbq joint.  Space has been newly reno'd and it's a fair size, open-concept, & clean with lots of seating.  There's no waiter service, but it's more of an order-at-the-counter, wait, & pay for your food when it's ready.  Menu consisted of a Silog section (Filipino breakfast w/ an egg, garlic rice, & some kinda protein), Iced Desserts/Parfaits, Kakanin (more desserts), Grilled Meats, & a list of stuff I couldn't pronounce that I'm guessing were probably the dishes in the chafing dishes (mainly stewed meats).  While waiting for my friend to arrive, I decided to order 2 combos w/ 2 sides, at $8/combo.  Each combo came with either white rice or noodles (Pancit), and I decided on the noodles.  Pancit is actually cooked to order because the guy behind the counter, asked if he could start cooking my noodles while I waited.  As for deciding on which sides the have, the staff member who helped me was quite shy and soft-spoken, so I just asked him for recommendations.  2 out of the 4 dishes were really not my taste: -  Kare Kare - A stewed oxtail w/ tripe, eggplant, some greens in a garlicky, somewhat tangy peanut butter sauce.  Weird.  No. -  Paksiw Na Bangus - Am I at a Russian New Year's Party?  No, I am at a Filipino restaurant.  Seriously, this dish was reminiscent of something Eastern Europeans would devour.  It didn't look appealing to me, but it was recommended.  It's a boiled pickled fish with a pickled green chilli & some eggplant, also pickled.  I thought it was a white wine sauce, but I was sadly mistaken.  It was pure white vinegar, quite fishy, & very acidic.  Not my thing at all.  My personal palate cannot recommend these 2 sides.  Maybe they are really good and authentic dishes in the Filipino cuisine, but they were difficult to stomach.  If you're Halal/Kosher/Veg/Vegan, don't Google what Sisig is.  Taste-wise, it was ok, but quite porkie...as I found out why via the web.  The more familiar dish was the stewed chicken in a tomato-based sauce.  I would go back, but I just wouldn't order those 2 particular sides again.  I'd probably try the Lechon (roast pork) to see how/if it differs from the Chinese version.  And I'd definitely be interested in checking out their sweets!"}
{"text":"** 2.5 **  The food is.....okay, to say the least. I had the 2 item combo, and I've definitely had better. The pork sinigang is a bit bland (but then, I like mine more on the sour side so that might just be me). The okra needed a bit more cooking time which was disappointing because I was quite excited to eat it. The adobo is meh. Either there is too much vinegar or the vinegar hasnt been simmered enough for the acidity to dissipate. And the potato was half cooked too.  The deduction of stars isnt really for the taste of the food. It pertains more to the fact that I feel ripped off because of the amount that I paid. $9 for a combo is a typical price, yes. I am not going to argue against. But to seriously get one piece of meat for the sinigang? SERIOUSLY? Atleast put another one. The container is big enough that it makes you think you'll get a decent serving portion, but that is not the case. Sure, you get a big serving of rice, but it is mostly wasted if you're out of viands.  The place itself is nice. Very clean, bright lights, spacious. They have a nice menu hanging on the wall showing the different meals and party trays they offer. From what I read from a review down below, they offer items that are cooked-to-order which is nice since you know you're getting something fresh. I dont know how that whole idea is working out for their restaurant, but I found that it didn't work well for someone like me who expected to be in and out of there.  Its not an overall bad experience especially since its so close to my office, but I dont think I'll be in a rush to come back. I'd rather drive the few extra minutes and head over to the Dixie Park mall where I know I'll get a better bang for my buck at a different filipino restaurant.."}
{"text":"The place is decent. Clean.  and MEALS are priced reasonably. But individual BBQ's & desserts are a bit pricey.  We ordered TAPSILOG & PORK BELLY- SILOG. Loved their garlic rice & pork belly but the tapsi was sort of dry.   We ordered bbq skewer too, but it has an odd taste of alcohol. perhaps rum?  Overall, we would eat here again only if we're in the area."}
{"text":"Went there in the morning to have their breakfast (beef tapas). The meat i was given was hard and very dry. Most likely it was microwaved as I heard one going off. The lady who served me at the counter was extremely polite.  3 stars for now till I try their other food selections such as sisig."}
{"text":"Great find in Mississauga for inexpensive and delicious Filipino food!   Surprised to find out they take reservations as this is more of a seat yourself type of place. The employee working at the counter when we visited was very friendly and took the time to explain everything on the menu as many of us hadn't been here before. She also made sure we enjoyed our meal and got our feedback which was amazing customer service!  I ordered the pork belly silog (breakfast). For ~$10, I got a small portion of green papaya salad, half a tomato, 2 eggs, garlic rice, and a very generous portion of pork belly (pre-cut too!). I love the taste of grilled meats so this was right up my alley! The size was just right too to fill you right up.  For the same price, you could also opt for the pork belly grill box which is essentially the same as the silog minus the tomato and eggs, but the pork belly was not pre cut, though looked like the portion was slightly bigger too! I also tried a friend's grilled chicken and that was also so delicious.  As we were finishing up, we were offered BOGO halo halo! I never had halo halo up until this point as I am not a fan of overly sweet desserts and that's what I always imagined halo halo to be. Surprisingly, theirs was not sweet at all which was great! The cup of halo halo was also huge so I had to split with another friend, and the both of us still couldn't manage to finish it after our meal! The halo halo was actually a meal in it of itself.  Overall, definitely recommend this place! And will come back to try their Kamayan feast (which we were told we had to reserve a few hours in advance)."}
