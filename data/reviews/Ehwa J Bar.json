{"text":"If you're looking for a place to kick back, and have a few drinks with your friends, then this is the place! I often come here for one reason, and one reason only: soju cocktail. My friend also recently introduced me to makgeolli (thanks bayon!), which is dangerously delicious. At Ehwa, they can flavour it with fruit, which we chose peach, and it was amazing!

The food is pretty standard, nothing extraordinary, but once you've had a few drinks, the Korean bar food (e.g. spicy fried chicken, rice cake, egg drop soup) definitely hits the spot.  

They also have a decent sized patio, probably fits about 30-40 people...great for the summer. 

The only thing I have to warn you is that the service is pretty patchy. It's not that they are rude, but that they are severely understaffed. On the Monday night that I went, only one waitress was serving, with one guy at the bar inside...and there were at least 6 to 7 tables of people on the patio, waiting impatiently. 

Regardless, I highly recommend this place, but just be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"They just didn't give us all the food we ordered. Even with our food missing it was pretty cheap tho. I'm not Korean so that could have been a factor in the terrible terrible service we received."}
{"text":"my go to k bar in toronto

{"text":"Ehwa J Bar is a Korean style po-jang-macha (food/beer hall) located downtown on Isabella Street.

The vibe is bumping, and the crowd is full of young students. There is additional seating upstairs but the vibes were better on the main floor.

The service was decent. We ordered the bul-dalk (spicy chicken hot plate) at the waittresses' reccomendation, and it was spicy but tasty. It came with several service (free) dishes of corn, french fries, and radishes.

The soju selection was not bad and the beers were reasonably priced. My only issue is that when I ordered my Soju, 3 shot glasses arrived with 1 of them being completely cracked. Sharp glass shards were sticking out from the glass, making me confused as to how she did not notice this. I understand it was dark, so I am a bit forgiving; but she could have at least offered us something as compensation (free soju bottle)."}
{"text":"First time here and I really enjoyed it. It's a great place to have some snacks and drink. We ordered a combo #1 with pork cutlet and a grape soju. We also order the spicy rice cake with chicken and some karrage. The combo also came with a lot of sides, which included corn, chips, fries and Korean equivalent of coleslaw. The pork cutlet was good and the portion was huge. Big enough to feed the 6 of us. 

The place was very dim and the music was loud. It's a great place to get hyped before headed out to a club or something. Not so great if you're on a date and have shitty hearing. The service was also great and quick. They also accept debit and credit. I'd definitely come back again and explore the rest of the menu. I know they have a great patio was I'll be back during the summer seasons."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday where the venue had setup a marquee in the back, which was all very nice and low key.

Inside was pretty jammed on the Friday night, the service was slow and annoyingly they charge expensive for liquor and then additional for the mixer??? Also you get that in a small plastic cup and if you are lucky they might give you one ice cube in a plate if you ask for it.

The crowd is a very youngish korean crowd so imagine girls dressed like girls and guys trying to look like girls.

The worst thing about this place is the washrooms, they are a complete mess. 

I did see a few customer's eating and the food looked like it might be worth coming back for but with all the other options in the area.....it would really take some persuasion."}
{"text":"Went in tonight to have a drinking night with friends and by the end of the night we weren't thinking straight and almost didn't pay enough tip. Thankfully the waiter was patient with us as we realized afterwards that we tipped very poorly. I'd say this place is a really good place to go with friends if you want to de -stress and have some drinks.
Really hoping the waiter doesn't hate us as he was really kind as we were paying our bill"}
{"text":"This was a difficult review to write because on one hand the restaurant had its faults, while on the other hand the group I went with was in fact difficult to serve because of our size. I came here with a large student group of about 50 ppl and we reserved the upstairs space. There was some confusion about how they would like us to order and in the end we decided it was simplest for each of us to order downstairs and pay. My friend and I split a peach soju, a pineapple soju, and a pork belly dukkbokki. Food here is a great deal. Super large portions for a super low price. Is the quality of food exceptional though? No, you just get what you pay for which is quantity not quality. The peach soju though was fantastic, and I would definitely re order it on another visit if the chance arises.

So where I'm conflicted with the rating was the service. At first I was super impressed with the female wait staff who were super polite and helpful in spite of the difficulties of catering to a large group. Where I was tempted to 2 star this place is the behaviour of one of the male staff. It was a social and we booked the entire upper space. But it was a friday so they sent some tables upstairs as well. That's fine, I get it, you need to make money. But since it was a social event people were standing up and speaking with each other, and while the male staff was trying to navigate through the crowd I actually saw him pushing people out of his way instead of just politely asking. I don't think that can be justified even in light of the crowded and stressful situation of the evening. However after much contemplation I think the female waitstaff definitely did enough to compensate for that and again, I also do understand that we were a difficult group. So in the end, I think my 3 star rating is a fair reflection of my experience."}
{"text":"The Food
Any Korean food you want, they serve. It is all prepared to perfection and the flavours are spectacular. I could eat the food here for the rest of my life. I recommend getting a dinner combo, included with a main course are four appetizers and your selection of five beers, all for about $24. For a main course, go with either the Spicy BBQ chicken with cheese (a delicious serving of boneless BBQ chicken covered in an unspeakably good sauce and topped with melted cheese, all sitting on a bed of tasty kimchi) or the \"Chicken Ball\" (tiny fried boneless chicken bits covered in a savoury sweet and spicy glaze - a uniquely Korean dish, not like the \"chicken balls\" you get at the Mandarin). The appetizers include tofu covered in chili pepper oil, tasty fresh golden french fries, seaweed salad and hard fried corn in a sweet glaze served in a small sizzling hot plate. DELICIOUS!

The Service
Prompt and alert, they will recommend dishes for you if you have no idea what you want.

The Atmosphere
Playing all of your house and hardstyle favorites, it's like a nightclub but in a sit-down restaurant. The interior is classy and the crowd is mostly students and Korean youth.

10/10, two thumbs up, five stars, just go eat here already."}
{"text":"Good food! Great price for a big portion! Definitely worth to go! However the service was kinda poor, they only had three waiters to serve the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"Great value do drinks and food. I wouldn't necessarily go there for dinner (the Bulgogi we ordered was okay, a lot of fat on the meat and the coleslaw tasted really strange) but for drinks and snacks (fries, cut fruit, edamame, karakage) to share with a group the prices are really good. Come early because tables get full after 6:30 on a Friday."}
{"text":"Cool spot to hang out. They have a great patio in the back. Always an energetic crowd composed mostly of Korean students. Notable dishes to try: seafood nooroongji, spicy chicken with cheese, cold noodles w/ sea snails. Better yet, put'em in a combo and get 5 beers or 1 bottle of soju! You'll also get quite a variety of banchan (not what you'd expect) to compliment your drinks."}
{"text":"The tonkatsu was a beast plate. Two large portions for a pretty good price (less than $15). But came here with four other people and it's a great place for dirty, junky, korean food. We had ordered off of their combo specials with either four beers or a soju. The amount of food was perfect and we got grapefruit and yogurt soju. Overall, it came to around $20 per person, which is not bad with drinks and dinner. The vibe felt like half bar/half club with a younger Asian crowd. Would definitely come back for patio season!"}
{"text":"Went here for some pre -drinking and food on NYE, we got the combo with rice cakes and pork belly, soo good! Good amount for the two of us. We chose to have soju b/c we've never had it and it was an experience. That's all I have to say about soju. The side dishes that came with it were not normal korean stuff. fries were good, corn was really good! I seriously want to know how to make it, the tofu thing was random and so soft that it was hard to grab with chopsticks, popcorn obvs good, cabbage with like thousand island dressing I liked it, my friend didn't. Overall good. Atmosphere was very cold. Definitely felt like an outsider. Small space but nice. Definitely getting beer instead of soju. Look forward to visiting again and hopefully we don't sit close to the back door. The cold air..ugh"}
{"text":"Great experience. Ordered the tofu kimchi which turned out a bit too spicy, so I asked the waitress what she could do and with no hesitation she brought it back to the kitchen where they prepared a less spicy version."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: it was quite dark inside, the tables were arranged in weird ways (there were tables on the second level but an odd single one on the first). Apparently there's a patio that opens in the summer and we'll be sure to check it out. The washrooms smelled really bad and were tiny, just like in every bar. 

Food and drinks: we ordered both the yogurt soju and the peach soju. They both tasted SO GOOD!!! Even though it came down to only 3 ish shots per person for $20, which we thought was quite pricy. What was better was that they brought out so many side dishes, including buttered corn (the best!!), fries, popcorn, chips, coleslaw, and tofu. They were all refillable. I'm still really shocked at how this place gives out free food. It's amazing. We also got the oden (boiled fish cakes); it was spicy for some reason, but we were too drunk to care. 

Final verdict: Definitely coming back here again for the soju yogurt shots! Things were a bit pricy but it was a lot of fun."}
{"text":"In TO for the weekend and decided to hit up one of the old stomping grounds from a few years ago so in steps in Ehwa. Walking back into this joint was like stepping through a time portal as nothing had literally changed. This joint remains to be a \"busy\" spot especially after 9 PM or so with a variety of people from college kids all the way up to late 20s folks. There are multiple tables throughout the joint and during the summer they have an outdoor patio area which is actually very nice. This place is perfect for groups to come and play your drinking games or even just catch up. I have this weird idea of not seeing bars as legitimate restaurants so I have not had the chance to actually grab some food here. They have a few combination meals that look solid and something I would definitely be interested in. The servers here are very prompt and attentive to the needs of each customer. Definitely a spot to hit up as it is a fun vibe and everyone is just there to have a good time."}
{"text":"Mediocre Food,
Strange Atmosphere.
I'm not Korean so I was weirded out."}
{"text":"This place is kind of weird if you aren't Korean. I asked a server what the name meant in Korean and he told me it was a Chinese name... As the only non Asians dining here I felt kind of weird but their food was good. The squid and seaweed was phenomenal and their beer seals good. There is a patio in the back that is nice but needs updating. Be prepared for tons of Korean smokers here. Also these Koreans get loud!"}
{"text":"Came here while on vacation. Reminds me of the bars back in Korea. they give so many side dishes...and I'm not complaining! Great place to hang out and drink with friends."}
{"text":"I heard of this place from my Korean friends as being a hub for young university students. I came here with a group of 20 for a friend's birthday on a Thursday evening around dinner time (approx. 7pm) and it was already pretty packed. We were sent upstairs since we were a larger group. When I went, the lower floor was playing more Kpop music and the upstairs was playing more EDM music. Service was slow but understandable because there was a lot of people already at the place and we were a large group. I would recommend getting the combo packages if you are looking to get a meal + alcohol as they are a better deal than buying both individually. They had a wide variety of Korean alcoholic beverages but they all seemed to be a bit pricey. Like any Korean restaurant, they gave us side dishes (free and refillable :) ) which were seasoned tofu, popcorn, and cheese on corn. The main dishes were alright, but I don't think the food is their selling point here. Overall it was OK but not sure if I would be coming back because while the food was okay and I wasn't really vibe-ing their atmosphere."}
{"text":"The yoghurt flavoured soju ($20) was delicious! My friends and I went there to chill and had a few drinks. We also ordered fries for $3 which wasn't expensive. I will definitely come back to try their food. 

The service was however 50/50. We weren't greeted and seated right away. We had to go to the bar to ask for seats. However the drinks and food came quickly."}
{"text":"We were looking to relax after the work week on Friday evening, and ended up at Ehwa. When you walk in and go up the stairs, there's a line of booths on the left side. The very first booth was free, but we had five people, and asked if we could take two of the tables near the back of the bar. The waitress refused our request, claiming that they anticipated larger groups arriving soon. After nearly two hours, there were still multiple empty tables. We ended up having to squish all our platters, with one person at the end of the table.

Apart from the service, the food was at par with what I would expect from a Korean bar restaurant.. We ordered some chicken katsu, which came with the usual sides, corn with cheese, and soju. However, not sure if I would go out of my way to return here."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place and only drank soju with some complimentary popcorn but still had a great time. It's very modern architecturally and sort of upscale looking while having good prices for food (looked over it while drinking). Low lighting, also Korean pop songs playing in the background at a good volume, sets a nice atmosphere. I will go back and try there food, which I have a feeling will be good to amazing and there awesome Korean alcohol! 

Also the waiter was a friendly guy who was very quick and helpful."}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to go here and it was a good time to say the least. 

3 stars because service isn't really attentive/ they don't have enough servers (took 30 min to flag down the server to even place an order) Place is very dim with few seating.

The food is pretty average. We ordered fries 3.99 and karage $7.99 which was pretty tasty. Fries taste like Costco fries. Ordered a bottle of green grape soju for about $18.99 and two shots of grey goose $8 each.

Over all it's a great place to have drinks with friends. It's very chill. Korean bar means mostly Korean customers. 

If you're looking for a casual night out you should try this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely best korean bar in TO hands down. It made all the korean bars in Vancouver go to shame with their enormous portions and generous service sides. All you can eat fresh fries, corn with cheese, salad, etc - all which you would have paid for in Vancouver. My fiancee and I was so surprised at the portions of everything we ordered we came back multiple times during our one week stay in TO. They give you double of what we can get in Vancouver for the same price!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty chill. I noticed though that bars in Toronto was small compared to bars in LA. Besides that it was all good. Food was decent and the atmosphere was nice. I didnt like the fact that they didnt have any korean beer. Not sure if it was just that day but that is a big no at a korean bar. Also i did not like having to drink in plastic cups. Either they ran out of the small glass beer cups or that is how they do it. I did not like that at all."}
{"text":"This bar has some pretty good chicken and combo deals if you're going in groups.  Would recommend giving it a shot. However, if you're going on weekends or holidays, definitely try to reserve a table.  It can be incredibly hectic and busy, which may serve to be a bit frustrating.  -1 for being too overcrowded and disorienting.  
Depending on how much you order, you receive extra bonuses like complimentary fries (refillable)."}
{"text":"I actually stumbled upon this bar thinking it was a restaurant... But they have a sizable selection of food so it was all good. 

First we got drinks which came with complimentary popcorn which was nice. Then we ordered rice cakes, tako wasabi, bulgogi and oden nabe. I think the food was a solid 3.5 but we got pretty decent-sized portions for what we paid so I'm bumping it up to a 4."}
{"text":"Great place for soju and chilling with your friends. The menu for food is pretty good too and the food itself is delicious. They take reservations for large groups which is great for a planned night  out."}
{"text":"The Korean fried chicken here is beyond delicious. Fast, attentive service and amazing food. Very fun atmosphere for going out and drinking and enjoying some Korean food."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this spot is not reviewed more, perhaps a hidden gem amongst Koreans? This spot is frequented by mostly Asians who are younger working professionals/students. When you enter it's dark pumping with music almost like a club but there's actually a cosy and relaxed patio at the back. I highly recommend to check out the patio! It's a great environment for a date or even a group friends to catch up. Even though people are in their own \"cliques\", from our experience, they are friendly and sometimes engage in conversation with you (we're not Korean btw).

The price is reasonable with a variety of combos, great for sharing - you choose one main dish and it comes with fries and refillable snacks (popcorn, buttery/cheesy corn, tofu, etc) and drinks (4 beers or 1 bottle of soju) to share. All for about $23-$30 depending on the dish you choose. It is enough to feed two people if you're not too hungry/not big eaters. Love the corn!! We got the spicy pork (~$26 with the combo) but the other dishes look good too! 

There are only like 1 or 2 servers for the whole patio so expect slower service but it's faster if you order more drinks haha. I would check back here again because I like the vibe, which is quite different than the typical bar scene."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hole in wall kinda place. I have now been here several times with friends for drinks.  A very relaxed environment to drink and eat good food! If you're looking for a place to just drink a lot of soju over popcorn and bulgogi then Ehwa is for you! I do wish the ceiling in the washroom were higher though. You can see where tall people like my self has displaced the ceiling with their head. I always have a good time at Ehwa."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks and food recently and thought it was overall pretty good! 

//ATMOSPHERE//
It's dark, loud, had gross washrooms, and the servers were mediocre. The bar is quite small but the patio area out back was pretty nice ! 

//DRINKS & FOOD//
COMBO A - We chose a bottle of grapefruit soju (which was 3 shots per person) and the pork cutlet. The amount of pork cutlet that was given was HUGE. It made the $25.99 combo well worth it since the cutlet came out in a really long plate, it was very filling between the 3 of us. The pork cutlet was seasoned, breaded and fried to golden crunchiness. And the sweet sauce on top was amazing.
Sweet corn - we also had a side dish that had sweet corn with some sort of milky buttery sauce. So delicious! 

Since I came here for a large group event, they had a large bucket of salted & buttered popcorn, with small bowls for snacking."}
{"text":"Came back to check out the patio and some more food. We were 5 people and only ordered 2 combo meals, since most of the snacks were refillable (we definitely got fries three times). We were super full and only paid $15 per person!

Army soup and the chicken rice cakes were both good and very spicy. It's not amazing but this place is more of a bar anyways! I definitely recommend this place for a small group if you like snacks and soju. Prices went up a few dollars since I came last year."}
