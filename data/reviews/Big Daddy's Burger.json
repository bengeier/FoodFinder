{"text":"My family and I have been eating here at least once a week since it opened about a year ago. There are no heat lamps, food warmers or any other things one would expect to see in a typical burger joint. And that's because this isn't a typical burger joint.

The food is fresh and the owners/staff are friendly. Speed of service largely depends on how busy they are, but it's well within acceptable limits.

Highly, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Greeted immediately. Friendly conversation. Busy little place. 
Great big burger. Well constructed. Very enjoyable. 
Would like to see fresh cut fries and home made gravy in the future though. A soda fountain would also help with the diner feel."}
{"text":"I ordered a big daddy burger  (14oz) and a big daddy poutine. The burger was good, it was big as expected, but nothing really special besides the size. The poutine was lacking cheese but if you are a meat lover you are gonna love it! The service was very good. But I feel like they should update the dollar signs to 2 signs."}
{"text":"Never thought a thin burger could fill me up but 7 ounces is still 7 ounces.  Nicely seasoned burger, fresh ingredients, and customer friendly staff/owner.  
Definitely coming back!
***make sure you get the sauce, it's tasty***"}
{"text":"Went to try this place out and thought it was expensive given the shady location, but the quantity and size makes up for it. I would probably not go out of my way to go again, but was content with what Big Daddy's Burger had to offer. Great customer service.


My order [$$]: (1) Big Daddy 14 oz. burger and (2) Big Daddy poutine

(1) The burger was 14 oz. prepared as a flat, thin patty. I found you had to eat around a ring of beef before actually getting to the burger. The patty is homemade and seasoned well which over all gives a better than average taste.

(2) The Big Daddy poutine had mounds of beef and sausage, but consequently a little lacking in cheese and gravy. The fries were freshly cooked and not greasy at all. The taste didn't blow my mind, but it was a different poutine experience."}
{"text":"1st time getting dinner to go . Awesome homemade burgers  yummy!!!!  Few things I'd love to see would be while wheat buns , sweat potatoes fries ,  and home cut fries . But we will go back ."}
{"text":"Best burger in Ajax hands down ! 
Every time I go there they never seem to fail me actually they always rise above ! ( except once but I will explain ) 
I get the banquet burger with fries and gravy for less then 10 (because I go for the student special 11 - 3 )
I technically gave this place a 4.8 because on one visit the cook was not all there that day and I believe he under cooked my burger ! But other then that it's usually cooked to perfection and they have the best fries ever  and gravy is good ! 

They use too have caramelized onions but not anymore I guess but still Amazing !!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at this burger joint after a round of golf. The prices seemed a but steep for the burger combos but I'll get to that.  I was pretty hungry and wanted fries and a drink so I opted for the 4oz combo.  The fries could have easily fed 2 or 3 people and were awesome. They were large but crispy and not greasy.  I suspect their poutine would be awesome...next time. The burger was great; made to order with fresh ingredients. I had the works sans hot peppers.  It was a lot of food for one person but tasted so good.  As I was leaving had a chance to talk to the owner.  The next time I'll have to try one of their home burgers.  They're made one site with their own spice blend and are huge. Hope to come back here with my wife so I can take down a burger and share the fries! Great value just need a major appetite or a friend."}
