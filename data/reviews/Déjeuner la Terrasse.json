{"text":"Nothing fancy here, just a solid breakfast at a fair price. Fruit was very fresh tasting. *Cash only*"}
{"text":"Simplement un des meilleurs restaurants à déjeuner de la région. Prix et nourriture sont excellents. Ici les pommes de terre et le bacon ne dégoulinent pas d'huile. Tout y est savoureux, même le café. On essaie par curiosité mais y on retourne en habitué."}
{"text":"There a fewer and fewer places in Verdun where you can get a decent, reasonably-priced breakfast. We decided to try out this place today and were very pleasantly surprised. It doesn't look like much from the outside but inside there is a definite feminine touch, with flowers and plants, and the service was warm and friendly.

The menu is varied, and there's a special kids' menu at $4 with a good choice of dishes as well. We had two specials at around $8 each, a kid's dish and a freestyle. The potatoes were crispy and delicious. The fresh fruit - an actual accompaniment and not just a decoration - was perfectly ripe and freshly-cut. The rest was fairly standard, but the whole, thanks to those details, made for a tasty and happy experience."}
{"text":"La terrasse est un endroit très bien pour un déjeuner efficace délicieux et rapide ! Et ce n est pas cher ! A choisir entre la Terrasse et le Crecendo par exemple, Terrasse all the way !"}
{"text":"Wow! Loved it...simple yet perfect!

For a place with 'Terrasse' in the name, I would've expected a nicer and larger terrasse than this place has, but we didn't mind going to eat inside anyways. The ~8 tables on the terrasse were taken and each time a table vacated it was quickly re-taken by newcomers. The seats were so close together there, though, I don't think I would have taken an empty spot anyways. 

Coffee was pretty standard shitty breakfast place coffee, but...

The menu was perfect for brunch: just enough choices and fantabulous prices! I had the croque monsier which is delightfully different here than other places: they grill the toast like grilled cheese n top it with 3 slices of bacon and a slice of cheese and an egg over on each half ! So tasty! Potatoes were great too and everything was piping hot! 

My bf tried a 'small' fruit plate, a banana-mango-strawberry smoothie and a side of sausage. He didn't like the sausage, but the fruit was cut fresh and was delicious. Had us both wondering where they get their fruit from it was so good n juicy! And the smoothie was perfection! Perfectly blended, not too sweet nor thick nor watery just perfect! And for such a decent price!! 

Service was perfect and smooth and friendly! Cash only tho btw! 

We will definitely be back we absolutely loved this lil diner stylez brekkie!"}
{"text":"This may be one of my shortest reviews to date, but just wanted to shout out to two specific items; their amazing small fruit plate (don't ever change it or the price), and their amazing chocolate chip crepes/pancakes (ditto the comments) - all kidding aside they are chock full o' chocolate chips. 

If you get both items mentioned above together, you are in for a real treat and the healthy offsets the indulgence. 

Apart from that they make good standard breakfast plates, smoothies and sandwiches. I have never gotten around to trying their lunch board specials, but imagine they are good too. 

And yes, as another previous post mentioned - cash only.

OK, fine, I'll say it, one not so great item is the tang like juice. Not sure if that's the non-fresh squeezed option, or if their is a fresh option - just recall, that it was not up to top standards."}
{"text":"For diner breakfast, this place is amazing! Service was prompt and coffee was poured as soon as we sat down - and kept coming all through breakfast. The portion sizes are hearty, so be prepared. I ordered eggs, toast, crepes, home fries, fêves au lard. Meals also come with a slice of watermelon, honeydew and cantaloupe. Prices are also great. Definitely would come back again!"}
