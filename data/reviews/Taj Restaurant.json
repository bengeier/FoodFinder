{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for unique restaurants and Taj serves up Central Asian cuisine which is quite a rare find. I guess the closest comparison is Uyghur food which I have tried.

The place is in a very forgettable plaza and the small signage means you won't know its a restaurant unless you have very good eye sight! I guess this is what you call a hidden gem. Inside the décor is very unique. Of all the restaurants I've been too, I've never seen this type of rectangular table/chair set. Their choice of chinaware is also very stylish. The décor makes you feel like you are in a different country.

The food itself was good. My only complaint is the grease level. We had the plov, lamb manti, a soup, and added lamb skewers. I think the soup was small for the price but the flavor was excellent. That piece of lamb in the soup was amazing. The plov was extremely oily, but the rice and the lamb were very flavorful. That's what I call the perfect lamb. The lamb skewers were also excellent. The manti were giant and full of lamb meat. Also very flavorful. This is a good place to go if you love lamb.

Prices were fair given the type of food. I'd definitely do the plov again despite the grease but would try their other dishes. If I have to nitpick, there is a bit of gamey lamb taste, and this can bother some people. The aftertaste stayed in my mouth for quite a while."}
{"text":"A rare authentic Uzbek restaurant in Toronto representing one of the most populous countries in Central Asia. Excellent food. Yummy samosas. Very hospitable and welcoming chef who turned out to be the restaurant owner too. Recommend."}
{"text":"I came here after reading the BlogTO article about the restaurant. I've never had Uzbek food so I was interested to check it out. 

The decor in the restaurant was somewhat spartan, plain tables and floors with a few rugs/tapestries in the walls. Russian/Uzbek folk music played in the background. 

The staff here are very nice! They were willing to explain everything on the menu and make recommendations, and the owner came out afterwards to ask us how everything was. 

There were three of us, and we ordered the following dishes: 

Kazan kebab - this was lamb kebab with red onions and roast potatoes. Nothing too special, but it was good. 

Manti - These are lamb-filled dumplings, which I really liked. They came with some sour cream. 

Plov - rice dish with chickpeas, lamb, etc. I think this was my favourite dish although, like the previous reviewer said, it was somewhat oily. Otherwise very good. 

Non bread - Round bread, came in a bowl. A good complement to the meatier dishes. 

As you can see, all the food here is very lamb heavy, so if you don't like lamb maybe this isn't the place for you. 

There is one dessert on the menu, listed as \"dessert\" so I'm not quite sure what it's called (possibly a Russian Napoleon cake?) It was layers of pastry with sweet cream in between, topped with coconut flakes. I really enjoyed it and wish I knew what it was called so I could make it at home. 

All in all this restaurant is great, and a must-try if you enjoy lesser-known cuisines."}
{"text":"I have been to every Uzbek restaurant in the GTA and really enjoy some of the staples.  So when my friends mentioned Taj, I just had to try it.   

I came in for a lunch on Tuesday and felt compelled to return  on Wednesday.  Of all the Central Asian spots I have come across in the GTA, Taj offers the best quality, the most welcoming atmosphere and the most authentic experience.  

Ethnic Uzbeks are renowned for their hospitality and Taj did not disappoint.

The ownership worked hard to distract their patrons from the drab and uninspired surroundings of of Dufferin and Finch.  Traditional carpets hang over the windows while large communal tables are covered with colorful table cloths.  We sat at an ornate wooden bench which was imported straight from Uzbekistan.

The chef/owner greeted us with the excitement and enthusiasm I rarely see in a restaurant. As silly as it sounds, it felt more like I was a guest in his home.  He explained the menu and made some welcome recomendations.

The food is spectacular.  A few of the dishes took a bit longer (15 minutes) as most of it is made fresh.  If you are in a hurry, it might make more sense to call in advance so they can get everything going.  

The lepeshka, still hot from the tandoor was very satisfying.  This central-asian bread is a little different from your typical Indian-style naan.  It raises in the oven and comes out soft on the inside while toasty on the outside.  

The Plov (a variation of pilaf) is a very difficult dish to do well.  At Taj, the plov is fantastic.  The lamb is very tender and the pomegranate seeds sprinkled on top give it a very nice twist.  

The Manti are large steamed lamb dumplings.  At Taj they were a little different from what I am used to but were also prepared well.  They were not too doughy and did not fall apart easily (really important).

Samsa is a flaky lamb-stuffed pastry baked in the tandoor.  It was also made fresh and came out really well.  

I also tried a new dish (the name escapes me) which is comprised of stewed veal liver.  It was very flavorful and tender and I will certainly have it again. 

Overall, Taj gets a well-deserved 5-star rating.  Your only concern here is over-ordering and over-eating."}
{"text":"The owners are wonderful!! Very, very friendly and welcoming! We just happened to be in the area and wanted to try something different and new. The food was delicious and very flavourful. We ordered the Manti (meat dumplings), Plov (lamb + rice) and the Lamb/potatoes. Would definitely recommend people to try this place if your looking for something new and quick for lunch!"}
{"text":"Well, this was certainly an interesting experience.

We showed up just after noon on a Saturday and the place was empty. We took a seat at one of the few tables and were immediately approached by a man I have to assume was the owner.

He began explaining what some of the items on the menu were, which was appreciated, for sure, but then he kind of wouldn't leave until we ordered. So he basically decided to order for us, which, again, is fine, but it also meant that our bill was essentially doubled. (We had planned on spending about $25 with tip but the cheque ballooned to $56, tip included.)

We started with an \"Achichuk\" salad, which is a simple yet delicious mix of tomato, onion, cucumber, and peppers, and topped with a very tasty dressing. I'll admit this was one of the better salads I can recall eating, as it's hard to resist a perfectly-proportioned-and-chopped assortment of veggies. (I can't imagine how long it must take to cut each and every vegetable so consistently.)

Next up was an appetizer called a Samsa, which is basically spiced ground lamb crammed into a flaky pastry. It's a little on the dry side but very, very good.

The main course was a rice dish called Plov, and although my dining companion and I had intended to share one plate, we wound up with two. (I took the leftovers home for dinner, so it worked out.) Anyway, this is a very tasty dish that's filled with rice, carrots, chick peas, raisins, and chunks of lamb. It's extremely greasy but undeniably delicious.

All in all, I really enjoyed the food at Taj. I just wish I'd had more of a say over what I ultimately ate."}
{"text":"small and unassuming uzbek restaurant with a lamb-centric focus.  i love hearing about rarer cuisines landing in toronto.  seats about 8 groups of 4+ people.  very friendly staff who are willing to explain their short menu.

- pot of green tea: kinda flavourless, wouldn't recommend
- carrot salad: julienned carrots in sesame oil and vinegar, topped with black sesame.  a very simple but tasty dish with a slight spice kick.  good
- tandoori non: non-what?  a thick, large, round piece of bread with ornate spiral designs on top.  crispy-crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  a little lacking in flavour, but still good
- manti: huge meat dumplings loaded with dill, topped with caramelized onions, and served with sour cream.  an absolute tornado of flavours.  extremely filling.  phenomenal
- tandoori samsa: meat (predominantly lamb), onions, and spices inside of a thin layer of flaky crust.  not as complex as the manti, but just as good.  loaded with meat.  lots of gamy lamb flavour
- uzbek plov: meat, rice, carrots, raisins, chick peas.  reminds me of afghan qabli.  would be my favourite dish of the evening if it wasn't so oily.  at the bottom of the plate was a shallow pool of oil.  still highly recommended

the best part was that the prices felt almost criminally low.  the portions and sizes are super generous!

what an incredibly hearty and delicious meal.  please go eat here!"}
{"text":"Very ethnic and authentic Uzbek food. If you are open for new tastes, this is the place for you. If you love meat, again this is the place for you. If you are a vegetarian, you may not have lots of options. If you are a vegan, stay away. 

The service is very fast, although the restaurant has a proper dining area and amazing service. 

Manti is a sort of chubby dumpling stuffed with a mixture of meat and onions and spices. It comes with a side of sour cream dip. 

The samsas are like a stuffed bread roll, kind of a meat pie. They are very fulfilling so one would be enough per person if you are ordering other stuff. 

They accept credit card. There is private parking in front of the restaurant. They are suitable for small groups."}
