{"text":"Had dinner here one night while visiting in the area.  My husband had a burrito and I had the philly cheesesteak.  Both were very good.  We also happened in just before 6PM and got the $2 draft price.

There was only one waiter/bar tender/cashier/do it all guy.  It got pretty busy, so go early if you can."}
{"text":"Simply put: rude, slow and bland."}
{"text":"The food was extremely slow to be served, and when we got it, it tasted terrible. The kitchen was filthy and the people serving us were rude and unfriendly. I would rather eat a dirty diaper than eat at Hahn's Peak Cafe."}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast after a Hahn's Peak hike. Had the green chili breakfast burrito -- real good! Yes, the place is under staffed but what can you expect with this tiny town. Genuine people, good food, great views. 

Definitely would return!"}
{"text":"Maybe the older reviews reflect different staffing, but my visit there late July 2013 was delightful.  The staffing is lean--so maybe when they're slammed the wait times suffer.  But I loved my surprisingly interesting but edited beer choices, great happy hours specials, and the mother of all nachos!  Besides, the prices are SUPER FAIR, especially at happy hour.  It's a great local stop with way above par food so close to Steamboat Lake.  

And the staff was really welcoming; I love how it was not scripted Steamboat but just local folk.  I don't know if I would travel to the area just to eat here, but if I were anywhere nearby I would definitely stop here again.  *P.S.  I did visit other local dining establishments.  I say this aware of the other local options: The best of the bunch!*"}
{"text":"I love having lunch on the deck. The food is great and for the size of the place, the menu selection is huge! Our group kept noticing how good the background music was. It really added to the experience. I asked about the music, thinking it was a Pandora channel, but the guy I spoke to said, \"It's our own playlist. We love good food and good music.\" We will be back soon. And often!"}
{"text":"Es war an diesem Labor-Day-Wochenende sehr voll und dauerte lange bis wir bestellen konnten. Dies hatten wir erwartet, daher kein großes Problem. Jedoch war die Service-Kraft zwar nett, jedoch ziemlich unfähig und in kleinster Weise bereit irgendwelche Extrawünsche zu beachten. Sie reagierte nur unangemessen unhöflich und war auch sonst ziemlich unaufmerksam. Irgendwann kam dann das Essen. Dieses war ok, jedoch auch nicht wirklich Top. Als wir dann getrennt bezahlen wollten wurde wieder eine unangemessene Bemerkung getätigt und ohne diesen Wunsch überhaupt zu beachten, brachte sie, nach 15 Minuten Warten, eine Gesamtrechnung ohne Aufteilung. Ich weiß nicht ob sie nicht rechnen konnte, jedoch setze ich sowas bei einer Servicekraft voraus. Dazu kam noch dass sich eine von uns von dem Essen am Abend übergeben musste. Alles in allem also nicht empfehlenswert..."}
{"text":"A group of us stopped for lunch one day while sightseeing in this lovely area not far from Steamboat Springs.

I was pleasantly surprised with a delicious green chili pork stew that really hit the spot.  Prices were reasonable and we all enjoyed our choices.  The waitress was friendly and helpful.  

I would visit the Hahn's Peak area for the scenery not for a special trip for lunch, but the meal was satisfying and the day was lovely.  Be sure to check out the nearby museum and early homes, jail, etc."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this gem after a hike in Steamboat Lake Park and didn't want to leave! Great menu food was amazing. We had the fish tacos, jerk chicken salad and sweet potato fries. All great!!! Best part you're not paying Steamboat prices, very reasonable! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This little place is a gem if you are ever up around Steamboat lake. Featuring a fantastic happy hour with $2 beers and $5 taco plates and nachos and great music as you take in the mountain views. Breakfast enchiladas are really good as well."}
{"text":"Came here after an early morning of ATVs up Hahn's Peak.  The idyllic setting and picturesque view earns it a couple stars.  Frankly we didnt expect much from a roadside diner in central Colorado. We were pleasantly surprised.

We ordered the Jerk chicken salad and the Turkey, Bacon, Avocado and Cheddar sandwich.  Both were delish but what really set them off was the homemade guacamole.  It added a depth of flavor that truly enhanced the most basic of dishes.  But wait, there's more.

The bake their bread in house.  And its the sh-t.  Great flavor and texture with that homemade density that lets you know the chef made it with pride.  

If you're in the area you cant go wrong with this place"}
{"text":"We finished hiking Hahn's Peak and were all hungry for some tasty local grubbin. Just off the highway, Hahn's Peak Cafe looked to be our spot. How wrong we were... We waited for over an hour for our food. And when it came out it was bland and tasteless. The salsa might as well have been tomato sauce. The Rueben was soggy and the Russian dressing on it must have been turning. The bacon burger had a ridiculous amount of cooled and thickened cheese that drenched and removed any hint of bacon. I'll never ever go back.

Oh, and as we were leaving we saw the state of the kitchen. Dishes piled everywhere. Food laying out. Very unsanitary conditions. We even saw a large tub with \"mayo\" handwritten on the side sitting by the window in the sun. Glad I didn't try the BLT!"}
{"text":"Liz is right. DJ is one rude son of a gun. Does he really want to be in business? He certainly doesn't want or care for my business."}
{"text":"Food was hot but need a little more pizzazz, the staff move with no urgency expect to spend a little time.  Donuts I hear are amazing."}
