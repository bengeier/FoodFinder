{"text":"Old World Style in Greek Town.
Friends rave about The Palace so we tried it on a quiet Tuesday night and it was nearly full. However, we soon discovered the crowd was a Quebec-based bus tour and soon we were alone with our server in this compact restaurant. Fine with us as it facilitated conversation without shouting, something becoming an increasingly rare experience.
The Palace looks a bit dated outside and inside and certainly not palatial. However, once we were heartily greeted and ushered past the cluttered open kitchen and seated we were quite comfortable. The traditional European-looking split level room is finished in stucco, with dark posts and beams, and terra cotta tiles forming a faux roof at the rear of the room with a few random pieces of artwork on the walls.
We began dinner by sharing the sturdy little house white wine and the Cold Mezza Platter, an assortment of 3 pleasant dips: a smooth Taramosalata, puréed Roast Eggplant and Tzatziki with tart pickled beets along with a basket of exceptionally tender right-off-the-grill pitas. The pitas were so good, we requested a second basket.
For our mains, we both had the Roast Lamb that was accompanied by buttery-soft roast Yukon Golds, and more than well done cut green beans and tiny carrots that both showed ample evidence of a far too long repose in the steam table. When a menu promises \"fresh vegetables\", we expect better than something out of a can. The ample portions of lightly sauced roast lamb were flavorful and tender, rescuing the overall impression of the meal. A glass of Lindeman's Shiraz suited the lamb nicely. 
For dessert, we shared a successful rendering of Baklava, rich with nuts and honey nestled among many leaves of phyllo. Yum!
Service was prompt, friendly and competent throughout our meal.
Our overall impression is The Palace is a candidate to have their interior refreshed and food lifted into the 21st century. However, with any luck they'll be spared a Restaurant Makeover, When we can enjoy a filling and comfortable meal in downtown Toronto for less than $100 before gratuity, that's a successful dining experience and just what The Palace modestly provides."}
{"text":"Holy cow. This place is a diamond in the rough. Don't let the looks on the outside fool you. This is as good a meal as you'll ever get at any breakfast or lunch place. Dennys,  IHOP, etc - can't hold a candle to the Palace."}
{"text":"The Palace Restaurant is one of my favourite Greek restaurants. They serve authentic fresh Greek food in their cozy, somewhat small, clean and classy place. Don't be fooled by their ugly exterior, the place is nice and pretty inside. The staff here is kind, helpful, and provide great service without being pretentious. 

Palace Restaurant has both a lunch and dinner menu. You can find hot and cold appetizers, soups and salads, plenty of grilled meat dishes, seafood, Palace specials, and their extensive wine and liquor list. I've tried their saganaki, exohiko (stuffed chicken), lamb souvlaki and more. The dishes here are excellent- satisfying portions, hot, fresh and cooked to perfection! The food here is pricier compared to other Greek restaurants in the area, but it's so worth it. For example, one entrée ranges from $15-$50 by itself. 

If you're looking for authentic Greek food made with fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection. I would recommend Palace Restaurant! This place will also make a great date spot; I would recommend one to make reservations since Palace is not so big and can fill up easily. Also, I can't remember exactly, but I don't think they accept debit."}
{"text":"BEST Greek food in the City!!!
I have been coming to the Palace Restaurant for the past 7-months each week and the food is beyond amazing!
In addition, the service is impeccable! It's owned by a family and the restaurant treats you like family when you came in.
It's somewhere I feel very comfortable and lots of local regulars come here each week!!
Love the staff and the food!"}
{"text":"Though certainly outdated in decor, both inside and out. The palace offers authentic Greek Cuisine in a very friendly atmosphere. The service was above average and Peter the owner personally attended to our meals. The bruschetta and pita appetizer were fresh and tasty. I enjoyed the lamb which was very tender and delicious. The only nit I would have is that the vegetables were over cooked. A great place for great food after getting past the decor."}
{"text":"This place is great. Kind of an old school atmosphere with excellent service to match.  The food was unpretentious and delicious.  About $50 for main, dessert, and a carafe of wine, for two. The place was almost empty, which is often less ideal, but here it did not take away from the experience. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Sadly I have given up wheat and can't order some of my favorite dishes here any more. But do try the roast beef sub au jus it's heavenly. The chicken parm is great too, because the chicken is grilled. Breakfast never disappoints. Fried squash is a local favorite. Same family owns it since early 80s! 

Please note they're closed every Monday (and like always craving Chick Fil A on Sundays, it's Monday and I wanted to go to the Palace) and also one week in July so everyone can go to the beach. They close at 3:00 pm."}
{"text":"Had an annual company dinner and it was an absolutely amazing eating experience! 

Customer service was top notch and quick with refilling my cup of water!

Here are a few dishes that I really enjoy.

Started off with an appetizer of saganaki and boy! That flame from the ouzo liquor just blasted me away with excitement. After the flame was put out naturally, I took a piece of the kefalotyri cheese and wow! Since the cheese was on a metal plate, the bottom part was crispy in texture yet soft enough to melt in your mouth 

Main dish consisted the following: Shrimp santorini, chicken kabob, lamp chops, lemon roasted potatoes, served with stir fried veggies and rice.
Omgosh you have to try their rice! It's got flavour and I'm not sure what's in it but it was very flavourful. One of my coworker did not try it so I made them to take a bite \"wow I did not expect that\" was her reaction! 

Since our company reserved 10 tables, they literally booked off the whole night just for us. The main dish was a customized one to serve 6 ppl per table, so I'm not sure if you can ask for the same platter that we got. The closest platter I could find on their regular menu is the \"palace platter for two\"

Food was plentiful and I took home a takeout bag :) I think it's a family business that spans a few generations, so I was so touched to see that they specially made a mouse cheesecake just for us as we left the door to take home. 

I would recommend this place to any company gatherings and date nights!"}
{"text":"Great local place for a burger!  You can simply tell my the volume of business they do that the food is good. We finally tried it after moving to town and were not disappointed. If you want a good burger for a great price The Palace is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years. Marinated beef tips over rice and garlic bread are amazing. Best Beef tips I ever had."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices; this place is the best mom and pop place in town! You will not be disappointed by eating here."}
{"text":".this is one of the best places we have ever eaten.food does not come from a can. Never have gotten anything that wasn't good from the Derby.health grade is always great
Jimmy and his family and staff are great. We have been eating there for years Jimmy if he's there always comes to our table , shake's my hand and speaks to my family. Best restaurant in town ."}
{"text":"They prepare food that real Greek people eat.

It's old school with career waiters. 

The owner takes great pride in his food.

I see that many other reviewers have used the term, old school, but I must agree. This is a wonderful place. 

I had moussaka and it was excellent. The lamb is delicious. 

Go."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and staff is super nice! The owner greeted us when we came in and when we left, even came to our table! The food was fresh and tasty! Pricey but worth it! Cute little place!"}
{"text":"Great Greek Village salad. Moussaka was mediocre. Chicken was okay. I've heard people rave but I feel like there are better choices on the Danforth. Parthenon is similarly old-school, but finer, IMO."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went here for the second time yesterday.  (Saturday). Each day has its own \"specials\" consisting of various meats and vegetables. There is a menu for salads and sandwiches as well.  Hubby had boneless fried chicken breast, turnip greens,fried squash, baked cornbread, mashed potatoes . I had the large salad and fried chicken strips . We had tea- sweet and unsweetened.  Everything was very good.  Pros: great tasting food, friendly,  helpful waitresses,  appeared clean, ample parking, great ice!, pepper vinegar and extra napkins provided without having to ask; wait time was adequate; I was offered a \"carry out box with a bag without having to ask; seated promptly.
  Cons: no cucumbers on salad, at 2pm the cleaning crew was already at work and had chairs on top of some tables in preparation for the 3pm closing time; closing at 3pm.  
    Highly recommended but be sure to get there before 3pm!"}
{"text":"This place is an institution in GreekTown on the Danforth, before even was a Greektown.  Very old-world style, down to the decor and furniture (think 1950s).  Don't pay attention to the outside looks - pretty bad, but at least it keeps the hipsters and wannabe yuppies at bay.  

The service is old-world style.  Don't expect supplication and running after your every whim.  That's not Old World.  Old World waiters are dignified, composed and take pride in their work - which is a lifetime profession, not just a part time period in life. 

The food is why you need to come here.  Food is amazing!  Taramosalata was actually made with caviar and not just pink-colored sour cream.  The gigantes were made in the traditional way, soft and mushy.  The Moussaka was excellent, the ground meat spiced just right.  It could have had a tangier batter on top though.

The keftades were made from mixed pork and beef and had a very good taste.  However the highlight of the evening was the Chicken Exohiko - chicken breast, stuffed with feta cheese, red peppers and spices, all wrapped in Filo pastry and baked together.  Amazing! Nobody bothers making compllicated dishes anymore, but this one was really amazing.

A gem on the Danforth that should be respected for its food, although the new kids don't like the ambience much anymore."}
{"text":"Old school Greek place.
The house red is tasty, not super sweet not super dry.
Try the broiled fish!!!! 
Grilles calamari are yummy!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt this is one of the best authentic Greek restaurants in Toronto. It may not be hip or trendy but I will take great food and service over trendy decor any day. 
I took my mom to Palace to celebrate her birthday as she adores the lamb chops. We started with the escargots.....I could have eat a dozen they were so good. Then I had the moussaka and my sister had the pork chops....all outstanding and cooked to perfection. 
Also the incredible customer service is unmatched.  The entire staff is always friendly and make you feel like part of the family. The chef/owner even gave my mom a handful of candies as a birthday present when we were leaving. Very special."}
{"text":"I've only been here a few times but every time it's been excellent. The food is always excellently prepared and the service makes the experience a pleasure. Very attentive and welcoming. I'm not sure if it's the owner or manager that was hovering nearby making sure everything was perfect, but it was appreciated.

The decor is a bit dated, but for me, it adds to the appeal as it feels like an old world family restaurant."}
{"text":"I ordered the Calabash shrimp and it came with a choice of vegetables and I picked french fries crispy, potato salad,  and I decided to try okra for the first time. NOPE.
Never again. I thought it would be better since it was Fried but the slimy texture came right through. Shrimp are tiny, But you get a decent portion along with your vegetable which was the okra and the french fries which were Delicious as usual and a little well done per my request. I don't know what they do with the tartar sauce but it's the best tartar sauce I've ever had in my life. I believe they had a lot of diced onion in it with some vinegar and of course mayonnaise and sugar. It was kind of like a tartar coleslaw without the cabbage. This place was COUNTRY and I loved it. I swear it's like going back in time when you eat at these little dives in the south. Don't expect incredible food at these places,  just expect a fun time, a few laughs and some decent people serving food that you'd probably make at home."}
{"text":"I'm not usually one of few words, EVER. Not even in my sleep; however, I find it easier to provide constructive critism than to offer a glowing compliment, so in my accepted shortcoming, I'll simply say that the pork kebab was easily the best meal during my three day trip. Not to mention the one with the best value. It's an easy trip to Palace on the Metro (green line), immediately across from the St. George entrance on Pape, so you have few excuses to not check this place out. Live a little!"}
