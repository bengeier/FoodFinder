{"text":"So disappointed... Show up as a walk-in and get asked to come back \"tomorrow\" because apparently the only person that can do fills is not available...."}
{"text":"They do an excellent job here and I was very satisfied with the end result of my nails. However, they definitely find every way to make an extra buck. Which is okay, as long as they let the customer know. I came in asking for all matte black nails and one silver nail. I knew the matte would cost a few extra bucks but I didn't care. But what I didn't know is that she was going to use a gel polish for my silver nail without asking me first, when I know they have regular polish in silver, therefore charging me an extra $25 or so for one nail per hand."}
{"text":"Ladies are amazing here !!! Come here they really take care of you for a right price!! Ill always come here when I come to las vegas!!"}
{"text":"I don't care for decor as long as it's clean and the upkeep of the place is up to par. I don't know the name of my nail tech but he did less than an ok job. Was pretty quick about the acrylic gel. Did a poor job on my left hand versus my right. See pics of acrylic gel chrome.  If he would of taken the distraction of his phone convo away and paid attention to what he was doing then maybe would of done a better job. That annoyed me. Underneath 1 of my nails is the acrylic powder that hardened and he never filed. When he put the cuticle liquid on my nails..he said \"rub them in, you're all done\" and walked away. Out of all the years that I've had acrylic gels...I've never had to rub them in. I was left with cuticle liquid on my hands and everything I touched. As far as customer service is involved...mediocre."}
{"text":"New management...Haley did my nails and brows and took her time with my design so my nails came out perfect. I was a walk in at 7:30 and she had no problem staying late for me. Couldn't be happier with her."}
{"text":"Hands down favorite nail salon. Always my go to. Highly recommend them to anyone who wants great service and amazing nails!!"}
{"text":"I love this place HAILEE really knows how to make you feel gorgeous. I have been to a lot of nail shops and trust me I know a great nail technician. She is truly amazing . Once you go here I promise you will go no where else."}
{"text":"Hailie did an amazing job on my halogram chrome style nails! And great pedicure. So glad I came here. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Gel manicure began peeling less than 1 week after service. Our nail technician \"hustled\" my mother and I by upgrading our pedicures to deluxe without informing us of the $25 additional charge bringing pedicure price to $45 each. That was with regular polish that is already chipping as well. Was very disappointed with quality of the gel manicure, and lack of communication about pedi upgrade. Will not return to this salon."}
{"text":"Amazing service and even more amazing quality! Jasmine did my nails and Sarah did my pedicure and I'm in love (with the girls and with my nails). Such friendly staff! Even better, it doesn't break the bank to pamper yourself. I highly recommend this salon for anyone who wants beautiful nails and a great experience."}
{"text":"currently here and msTina hooking me up with a bomb peddi. and she so gentle but efficient. my first time here and im already loving it. i called and they let me come at tht momment. awsome!!!"}
{"text":"this place is so cute and everyone is super friendly! I got gel nails which are supposed to last long, but it's already chipping and it's been less than 5 days ):"}
{"text":"Wonderful, clean nail bar.
Staff super friendly and accommodating.
My feet & hands are perfect.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Jackie did an amazing job on my nails! I finished dinner and noticed they were open past 9:00pm and I decided to get my nails done. Jackie took her time and did not rush. You could tell she really cared about getting everything right! The owner was also there and he was super nice. They brought me a water to where I was sitting as well. Great place!"}
{"text":"Hailee is the best. I love her. I'm sad I'm leaving the country, my nails will never look the same again :("}
{"text":"Really clean! Cute and comfortable. Hailee is so patient and always makes sure that I'm happy with my nails before I leave. She did a great job fixing a huge (painful) mistake done by another salon. Definitely recommended to friends and anyone who will listen :)"}
{"text":"Sexy Franz was great!  Accommodated a walk in and took great time and care on my pedi :) thank you, definitely will return :). Water was hot, great color selection, place clean and swank"}
{"text":"I had Jasmine as my nail tech she was amazing no complaints about her no complaints about the environment of the salon beautiful salon. The reason I'm giving this a one star is because my credit card keeps getting hacked. I went there and got my nails done and paid with my credit card and then a few days later my card was charged again for a different amount. I called the nail salon and they refunded my account. Well here we are three weeks later and my card has been charged again for $100 and I have not been to them since that my first service. The security of my card is very important to me and if they cannot keep my card safe I will not be returning to this place.  It's very frustrating that this keeps happening only at this location!! Please fix your card reader and make it more secure for your future clients!"}
{"text":"I was referred to Hailee by a co worker and she is truly gifted. Very fast and professional. The perfect combo for me. My nails are beautiful and everyone loves them. I cannot wait to visit again. 

Thanks Hailee"}
{"text":"i was there yesterday and because of the location and how nice the salon is, o thought it was gonna be great service but omg no, there was nobody there! my husband and i ask for pedicure and in 12 years living in las vegas at different areas of the city i have never had such a bad service , and my lady was better then my husbands lady, i don't know her name but was a african/american she was chewing gum the whole time looking to the window, she finish in like 10min she didn't even scrub his feet, she didn't ask if he wanted maybe clear cot, you could see she didn't like doing pedicure! i get pedicure so they can absolutely clean my nails and feet, not just to paint my nails, i can do that myself! and neither said a world the whole time we were there! don't waste your money in this place"}
{"text":"Great nail salon! My gel mani and pedi always lasts a long time. They also do a great job waxing. Tina provides great customer service and always does an amazing job on all of my services. Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Great Gel pedicure that included a citrus scrub. Very detailed work, not rushed like most places and very clean pedicure tubs that are lined with a new plastic wrap for each customer. Friendly staff and fair pricing. Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"I thought they are good..I am disappointed. They don't clean up the edge of the nail before placing them under the lamp causing the gel to peel. Their solution is file the hardened gel to detach from the skin which is so wrong."}
{"text":"Great service! Jackie was a sweetheart. Got a gel mani & pedi & both looked amazing. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My go to place for nails!

This shop is absolutely \"gorgeous\" with fur seats and pretty pedicure stations. They offer a wide variety of services like manicure, pedicure, waxing, and lashes. My favorite nail lady is Tina. She is absolutely gentle and caring for your nails. I've never seen someone take so much time on my nails instead of rushing to get done. She really wants you to be happy with your service. She always listens to how you want your nails done which is something many beauty artist fail to do. I highly recommend Tina! Call to make an appointment because she gets really busy. Let her know that Sophia sent you! :)"}
{"text":"I come here all the time and love this place. These are my nails a month and a half later! I've searched high and low for a good place to get my nails done and finally found on! 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm in love. Not only is the salon itself gorgeous but the people are amazing. They can hold real conversations which seems to be rare nowadays. My nails are the exact shape, length and thickness I wanted. They definitely found a new regular"}
{"text":"I love my nails! I am getting ready to go on a cruise. I found Haylee through all the good Yelp reviews, she did not disappoint. I can't wait to show off my nails the are so cute. I took my fianc√©'s 89 year old grandmother with me at the last minute. It was no problem they got her in as well for a mani/pedi the girls were so nice to her. I have been searching for a great nail place for quite a while. I am happy I found one. Plus the price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great spot!! We made a last minute appoitment for for pedicures and so grateful we did! Very clean, upscale spot and the prices are extremely reasonable! Even had a nice foot massage. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"My mom and I have been avid Polished Nails customers for 5+ years and decided to try Gorgeous. We booked our appointments about a week in advance and asked if they had Light Elegance Hard Gel AKA Rockstar and also Pink Smoothie and they said yes. Knowing they had these polishes made it even easier for us to go since these our my favorites. Our appointments were on a Sunday at 2pm and we were there for FOUR HOURS for a Gel Manicure & Gel Pedicure. Mind you, this is at most a 2 hour service. We did not leave until 6pm which is after hours since they close at 5pm on Sunday's. My tech Luis was nice pretty quiet and did not know what he was doing. I don't think they provide any sort of training since I had to tell him how to put my gel and sparkle coat on. When he asked me which color I want to go with I said Pink Smoothie with glitter coat. He was puzzled and didn't know what pink smoothie was and they do not carry any Harmony Gel colors. His associate told me to use Shellac which I have had a very bad experience with since it peels. She was very pushy and basically forced me to use Shellac as a base. I don't know who this lady was but she was loud and obnoxious. She eventually left to go get \"supplies\". He got done with the gel on my toes and it was sticky and bumpy. He said he didn't feel that it was. I even had my mother touch my toes and she said it does not feel right. He seemed bothered and noticed he was using the wrong top coat he then used Harmony top coat and it was a little better. At this point I was unsure if I was going to get a manicure because it was already 3:30pm and my pedi was not even done yet- I got there at 2pm. I decided to get my manicure and I wish I didn't. Luis did such a sloppy job and I think he was never trained or even licensed for that matter to do nails. When he was done with my nails I told him they are very bumpy and he should buff them out. He said he never buffs or files them after. I told him I've been getting gel nails done for over 8 years and yes you need to buff and file them out. The tech who was doing my moms nails overheard and agreed with me. The lady who went to get \"supplies\" came back and I asked them to please use my 10% off first time customer discount. She immediately got in my face and said no we are giving you $10 off for the glitter. I said excuse me? You need to honor my 10% Yelp check in offer. She told me it is $5 more to add glitter on nails & toes so that is $10 and it is considered a design. WTF?! #1, glitter is not a design a design would be something that is painted on, #2 this expectation was NEVER set. I told her I will never come back here again and this service and quality is awful. She got all upset at me and eventually gave me the 10% Yelp Checkin. She then proceeded to tell me if I want to see one of the better techs Hailee to call and book an appointment since she doesn't work weekends and booked out. Wow! Thanks for the heads up lady I'm never coming back. And, I was even looking to do eyelash extensions but not now. This place is a total rip off and I walked away paying $80 for really poor service and AWFUL looking nails. Please look at photo attached. I will go back to Polished since they are consistent with their staff, service and polish. NEVER AGAIN GORGEOUS YOU ARE TERRIBLE!!"}
{"text":"Best nail salon in Las Vegas! I get my nails done by Jackie. She's the absolutely the best. The salon is so nice and comfortable. The nail color options seem endless. Go by and they will treat you very well."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here. I love that the gel polish stays on for over 2 weeks. I've been to different places and this place by far had been the best. I woud've gave it a 5 star they were late opening their shop the last time when I had an appointment. Other than that this place was wonderful and relaxing."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I've gone here a few times and all times have been amazing. The most recent visit was my favorite because their new tech Jasmine was working on my nails and she did so good. I love how she was talking to me, so customer service was definitely up to par. My go to spot, and as long as Jasmine is working here, she will be my go to nail tech!"}
{"text":"Had my nails done by Hailee and she did SO great! My nails were fixed from the last person who had done them did horrible. She knows about all the trends on nail shapes/designs."}
{"text":"It was a pretty good experience. My nails turned out cute however, I had asked for a matte finish and it felt like he was rushing to get done. He also cut the skin around my nails too deep a couple times not even the cuticle. They were kind of tender the next day."}
{"text":"I LOVE this nail salon. I searched for a long time and went to at least 15 different places in this area before finding this gem; I will never go to another Salon now that I have found Gorgeous Nails. They do amazing designs at reasonable prices (check out their Instagram page) and all the girls there are so sweet. I love going to Tina, she does a fabulous job and is super easy to talk to."}
{"text":"Jasmine is the best! She makes sure she keeps your nails as strong and healthy as possible"}
{"text":"I was cut on two of my other fingers but sadly I can't take a picture of it. This is the epitome of quantity over quality. He rushed through it knowing that I was squeemish the first time he cut me. The edges look horrible. This is after I asked him to fix it.  My number one pet peeve is speaking on your phone. Would you like your server on their phone at a restaurant? I never ever leave less than 15% tip even if your service is poor. This time 0%. He still had the nerve to tell me but not to get upset and told me to smile. That was the cherry on top. I don't have one good thing to say about this place."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and easy online appointment making through the Yelp App (bonus). They were very welcoming here too. Thing is they just didn't do a great job on my nails. It was mediocre at best. I've been wearing acrylic and gel nails since 1997 so I've had downright frightening nail experiences to perfect fills-in and everything in between. Gorgeous nails offers a Yelp discount for positive reviews but being truthful is more important than saving $5. My nails were thick and not sanded well in the corners. In less than a week they were lifting. The salon has a lot going for it (late hours, great location off 215, friendly staff, easy appointment scheduling on Yelp) so hopefully the quality will improve."}
{"text":"I always love coming to this nail salon. They have such a cute setup inside and are always professional and do a good job. I personally always have Hallie do my nails, cus I think she's the best!"}
{"text":"Every time I get my nails done here I get so many compliments. I couldn't recommend this place higher!

Jasmine and Hailee are so sweet and AMAZING at what they do. I've never had my acrylics so smooth, and such perfect polish. They go above what I ask for every time I come in, and the prices here can't be beaten. 

So many people ask me about where I go, and I always suggest this place. I'm super picky about nail salons, but this place keeps me coming back. I love it!"}
{"text":"I used to go to another nail salon where the price was just really high & my friend told me about this place & I'm so happy I gave it a shot! Jasmine is amazing!"}
{"text":"After a crazy work week, my manicure was ruined. My regular salon closes at seven, so I did some yelping and saw that this location was open late on Friday (11:00pm). I called first and confirmed that they were still open. The gentleman was super friendly, and told me to come on in!

The salon was really cute! Hailee was my technician. I was just getting a polish change, but she filed my nails up and made them look really nice. 

The price was suitable for the service, and after three days my nails are still looking really great!

If you're looking for a place that's open late but still provides great service, this is a great place for you!"}
{"text":"My nails were a wreck the tech Hailee did an amazing job, absolutely beautiful job , wonderful customer service, super convenient location!"}
{"text":"this place is so cute, comfortable and quiet. this is my second time here and there has never been a wait! the girls are welcoming and friendly. 

my new favorite nail place! they also have free wifi and water!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable and they did my toes exactly how I wanted :) and I am very very very picky lol, this will be my new pedicure spot !"}
{"text":"The shop is now soft opening, there re-brand opening is Jan 23. Glad I came here and meet Tina. She is the best, she is very good with the ingrown nails. The shop is clean and beautiful. I would recommend my friends to come here."}
{"text":"Hailee is absolutely amazing! She was my nail tech at a previous salon but after losing touch for more than 1 year I finally found her!!! She has a true God given talent and is truly passionate about not only nail design but health and does what is best for the individual customer. The shop is absolutely fabulous and provides a comfortable atmosphere. I have referred several friends and they are all blown away by her kindness and talent! Try this fabulous shop they are a one stop shop I can't wait to try out other services!"}
{"text":"So happy I found this place! I've been to a lot of nail places and I think I've found my permanent spot! I used to go to Elaine nails for a year straight, until I came across this place. Everyone is so nice there. I always get Jasmine whenever I go, she's amazing!"}
{"text":"I get my nails done here with halee and I love them! Everyone else is super nice too and super hospitable! They always offer guests something to drink and the foot scrub is amazing! They do a very good job here :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I couldn't imagine going anywhere else. I always get a warm welcome and great service. Making an appointment is super easy ...thank you for always making my hands GORGEOUS!

I have added photos above. Let their work speak for its self!"}
{"text":"3 stars stars because the first time I came here a few weeks ago I came in around 7-7:30pm and I got a guy and he was perfect. I forgot his name but he was quick, nice, and my nails lasted for weeks. He told me I have a $5 off for the next time so I decided to come again. I called ahead at around 11 asking if they had availability for a gel fill and a pedicure they said  they would be at 2 so I came in about ten minutes early to pick my color. When I came in there were 2 employees and they were both busy. I picked my color sat down for my pedi with a girl who is obviously new. I put my feet in ice cold water, she used half a bottle of lotion on my legs then wiped it off and my paint job is streaky and my toes are filed a little too low. It wasn't that bad but definitely not the best. So about a hour later, when she was done, she said I could sit there while my toes dry because I had to wait for the other girl to be done. The girl who was supposed to do my nails was with someone else and she'd be done soon. Before I even walked in, while I was getting my hour pedicure she was on the same girl and not even done shaping her nails when I was done. At first I thought maybe she wouldn't be that long, I mean why would she tell me to come in at a certain if she was gonna run more than a few minutes late right? Wrong. I sat there for 20 minutes and she never not once came over to let me know how long it'll be or suggested to come back another time or leave and come back. So I decided to leave because at this point I'm there a little too long and I was irritated. I just don't understand if they are short staffed and are running behind why wouldn't they just tell me to come at a later time? Or let me know that it'll be awhile before I'd be able to get my fill? Why am I just sitting here not knowing how long the wait will be? So I get up to leave the girl stops doing the other customers acrylics to cash me out. Doesn't acknowledge how long I've waited, doesn't apologize, doesn't offer to reschedule, nothing. I give her my card she ran it twice and said it was declined, which i thought wasn't a big deal bc my card has been acting up lately. So after I had my mom come give me money then just left. I went to Starbucks AND another salon and my card went through with no problems. Awful customer service please rethink going here when all of their Yelp reviews are either 5 stars or 1 star. They offer discounts for good Yelp reviews, lol tacky. If you're coming here come at night!"}
{"text":"Love my nails. They are exactly what I wanted! Kind of pricey but it was worth it. The ladies were very nice and were very friendly. Defiantly coming back when I come back to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I love this place. Haylee is always so sweet and accommodating. Jasmine also does a really great job. They suggest great colors when I can't make up my mind and they're open late when I get off work and need an appointment."}
{"text":"Dan is so energetic and sweet he had us laughing the whole time :) great for walk ins !"}
{"text":"Recently moved to vegas and have used a few different salons. I was skeptical to step out of my zone by doing longer, coffin style acrylic but I'm so glad I did! I love it! Typically I break nails easy or my gel peeps but not this time. It's been 2.5 weeks and I could honestly go longer without a full bc they still look so good. Looking forward to seeing them again this week!"}
{"text":"My new favorite nail salon! The girls were so friendly! It's set up so well. My girl made sure my nails looked perfect, she told me to let her know if I needed to her to reshape, etc. the pricing is worth the quality of nails!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit here.  Felisha was so friendly,   and took her time on my nails...for the first time in a long time I didn't feel like I was being rushed through.  When you go get your nails and toes done it is a treat and should be an enjoyable experience.  Selena (I believe was her name...she was so soft spoken,  not sure it is correct) did my pedicure and likewise took her time and did a great job! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I Looove  my nails I did the gel there  just perfect the salon is super chic and there very friendly , great price too will definitly return :) thanku!"}
{"text":"This nail salon sucks because the salon is short staffed and the nail techs are over worked and burned out. They get defensive and rude if you question your service and you pay a lot of money for crappy service"}
{"text":"Sama did an amazing gel manicure for me, actually the best gel manicure I've ever received. And she soaked off my existing gels (from a different salon) by using the little cotton balls soaked in acetone and then clamped to each finger, the way gels are SUPPOSED to be removed. It's been a week and although I've had to use my hands roughly a lot this week, there are no chips or lifting. Sama, you are the gel guru ! Thank you for making my nails pretty."}
{"text":"Tina, Raj and the owners are  extremely friendly as soon as you arrive they greet you with a sincere hello gorgeous!!!  Beautiful salon, and exceptional service, high quality products and professional gel mani and pedi.  I finally arrived at a salon that uses high quality products and doesn't brush you off and do a horrible job where the gel polish chips the very next day,  like my last salon here in Henderson on Eastern.  My mani and pedi last a long time and when i go back it still looks fresh.  You get what you pay for!!!  But sometimes you don't, my last salon used cheap products and was way overpriced, they were more interested in there staff making money than the customer providing service and quality products.  Gorgeous nails will make sure when you leave you look gorgeous!!  Thank You Gorgeous Nail Lounge"}
{"text":"I was looking for a nail tech in Las Vegas while on vacation/work and i came across this salon. I'm very picky when it comes to nails & I expect only perfection! After looking at some pictures from this salon i decided to give it a try. \"Hailee\" was my tech's name and she is freaking AMAZING! I showed her a picture of the nail shape i wanted and she knew exactly what to do! She took her time and her conversation was great! I hate nail techs that don't acknowledge you & she was far from that! When it came to choosing a color they have hundreds of gel selections and regular polishes! On today's visit I went with \"Tiramisu\" by OPI, which Hailee suggested & I'm obsessed! Ps. Got waxed by \"Tina\", lets just say my face is baby butt smooth lol! 10 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"They are under new management and remodeling, can't wait to see when it's done!!

They took so much care with what they were doing and I really appreciated that.

Miss Hailey draws a lovely snowflake :)"}
{"text":"The salon is very nice on inside. But it took two hours for a full set. Had to remove two nails that where placed crooked. Then charged me $60 just for full set coffin shape and gel hologram. What's salad is I'm a licensed cosmetologist so I know how things should be. Very unhappy for first experience I didn't even get my pedicure because nails took to long. Nail tech was sweet but not happy with experience. I'm not one to complain so easily either."}
{"text":"If you want to come to a  welcoming organized sanitary clean and beyond excellent service-- come here !! The staff is not only very kind, diligent, efficient and accommodating -- they're talented , creative and experienced !! I had an appointment with Hailee,  I'm positive all of the staff is . She created my wedding nails and they're more than perfect. Definitely telling all of my family and friends!"}
{"text":"This salon looks really pretty inside. I really liked the decor and furniture. My nail service was okay. I'm only annoyed that I made my appointment and specifically requested Hailey and then someone else ended up doing my whole service. He completely rushed through the whole time he was doing my nails and kept telling me to relax which I thought was so rude. My nails turned out okay which is why I gave 4 stars."}
{"text":"I was look around for a nail salon and found this place I loved it so much just when I walked in they greeted you when you came in and was very welcoming, I got a pedicure and acrylic and it has been the best full set I have had in a long time, my pedicure was so relaxing I can't wait to come back and get my nails filled I have found my new favorite nail salon and I recommend Jackie she is amazing! :)"}
{"text":"Jackie Hernandez is best nail tech. She very detail oriented. I drive 4 hrs each month from CA just for her nail service."}
{"text":"In love with this place ! Definitely coming back again. They are so sweet and welcoming. Gorgeous nails has amazing customer service and they make sure that you're happy with your nails and eyebrows. 

Tina is amazing, she knows what she's doing and if you want something she'll make sure to do what you want. 

The place is very clean and they give you water and you feel like you're at a spa. Whenever I went there was never a wait."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Vegas so I've been looking around for a nail place and new nail tech and I want to say Jasmine the Nail tech is amazing at her work, very kind, sweet, and her work speaks for itself. She's hands down the best nail tech I've had. The salon is very nice and comfortable, I give them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This nail salon is beautiful the prices are reasonable too. I will continue to go here. The only problem is they didn't have many nail techs they only had 3 at the time so it is recommended that you make reservations before you go"}
{"text":"So I've only been here once but had a great experience. Some other reviewers indicated that the good reviews were paid for. This is not a paid review. I had a male nail tech who was very friendly. I asked for cat eye nails but they didn't look quite how I wanted after he started. I'm not sure if he had done them before. However he showed me \"halo\" nails and did those instead no extra charge. It was not perfect which is why I'm not doing 5 stars but they did a good job. It didn't take too long either. About an hour for the whole appointment. I like that you can make appointments online. They are open late 3 times a week. I would recommend them."}
{"text":"After a couple of years I have now found my nail salon!! But wait most important I found France's he is amazing and so creative. Tina is also amazing she takes care of my baby girl. Thank you guys!!"}
{"text":"Go to Tina for your pedicure, she gives the best massages! My pedicure always lasts a really long time as well. I exercise a lot and have a lot of callous from being sweaty and in tennis shoes all day, and she always smooths them out for me."}
{"text":"Hailee is the best! She's super sweet & friendly. She always makes sure I get the best experience every time I visit. I've only been here two times and this is already my new favorite nail salon. If you are looking for a new nail salon, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Please disregard any unpleasant reviews about the shop!!! I believe the reviews were aimed towards the previous management since I've been told that they are currently under a new one. The place itself is so cute and  aesthetically pleasing since it has been remodeled. The staff here (Tina and Hailee) work efficently to meet the customers expectations. I just got my nails done by my favorite tech Hailee and im very pleased with the result. She is cute, sweet and very attentive while working. I also got my eyelashes extension did and I absolutely in love with my lashes!! It was also my first time ever to get them done and suprisingly I didn't feel any discomforts AT ALL during the process, in fact it was relaxing! This is my absolute favorite place to go get my nails and lashes extension done and for anyone who's looking for fantastic service and great results, I REALLY recommend this place!!! Thanks hailee for beautiful nails and lashes :^)"}
{"text":"Probably the worse mani/pedi I have ever gotten.  The polish on my nails was sloppily done, there were some bubbles and on my thumb the nail tech put too much polish on one side, making a large lump.  The pedicure was lazy with very little scrubbing on my heels to remove the dead skin and the polish chipped within hours of leaving.  Paying $75 (including a tip) was not worth it at all, I could have done just as good a job, if not better."}
{"text":"I came across the nail lounge while visiting Starbucks and decided to give it a try and I must say it was by far the best decision I've made. Jackie was AWESOME! She was professional,nice and left my nails looking great! I would definitely recommend my friends and family to stop by. Great vibes from the staff and good music was a PLUS!"}
{"text":"I got my nails done by Johnny and I love love love them. He was very patient with trying to understand exactly what I wanted so he could make them perfect. He took his time and was extremely sweet and great with his work. I definitely will be coming back. I love my nails and I even more enjoyed the good energy that was in the nail salon while I was there. I highly recommend Johnny."}
{"text":"Better than all of the other nail places because it's clean, clean, clean! I like the afternoon to detail and the options they can do . Plus I rarely get put off to come back or try to make me wait an hour with my feet soaking.  This place is calming too. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Clean, nice decor, friendly staff and quality products. I will be back! I got an acrylic fill with gel Polish and my boyfriend got a pedicure. The massage chairs were nice and they are very clean and sanitary."}
{"text":"Love love love Hailee and Ms. Tina. Awesome customer service. My new home Plus they stay open late ( midnight) which is really convenient for me since I work during the day. Must stop by they also do lashes, waxing, micro blading and teeth whitening ( on sale for $99)  stop by ladies and gentlemen"}
{"text":"I'm so sad I really wanted to like this place . Super trendy and up with current styles . The girl that helped me was friendly . I loved the shape and work that she did on my nails however I got them done last night and today the Polish has already chipped on my thumb. For $60 bucks to be chipped the next day is dissappointing and I work an office job so it isn't an environment where I do labor for this to happen."}
{"text":"Sama did a fantastic job on my toes. I think I found a new place. Clean and friendly environment. Very pleased."}
{"text":"Looked up reviews for a last minute appointment. The salon I go to was unavailable but I figured I could look online and find something. With the stellar rating I figured this would be a good place to go. I wanted a pedicure and my sister a gel manicure. We booked the appointment fairly easily and arrived on time. The girl doing my pedicure had no experience, and to make it worse, didn't ask any questions. Wondering if she was even licensed since she doesn't typically work there and left immediately after the pedicure was completed.  I ended up with extremely short, round, thickly polished toes. To be fair I picked a sheer color which I knew would be light but she felt the need to lay on about 10 layers. 2 hours later they still smudged. A few techs asked if I wanted it fixed but I really just wanted it to dry so I could leave so I refused. The pedicure bowl did not have a plastic inlay so you're on your own as far as how clean they are and I'm really regretting the pedicure now. What saved this review from a 1 star was the manicure on my sister was fairly decent and the fact that they wanted t fix my Polish. If you take the time to read reviews you will see they offer a discount for 5 star reviews....not ok. Not the best but not the worst but I still won't return."}
{"text":"Highly recommend Jasmine! I usually like my acrylics really short and to look as natural as possible. At other nail places they usually roll their eyes when I ask for them to shorten them but Jasmine knew exactly what I wanted. I will definitely be going to her again! :)"}
{"text":"Positives: Salon is super cute on the inside and everyone is nice. 

Negatives: I paid $70 for a pedicure ($25) and a full gel set ($45). I don't mind paying for quality work but if you charge me $45 for a set it should look much better than the photos attached to this review."}
{"text":"I've always seen this nail salon on my Instagram explore page and finally decided to try it out. I'm so glad I did! Jasmine did my nails and she did an amazing job and gave me exactly what I asked for. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly, very impressed with this place! I am very picky and read tons of reviews before stepping in somewhere. This was close to work and I was in need of a pedicure so I gave it a try. Walking in, the place is clean and very catchy to the eye. Great service and great ambiance. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this nail salon they do my nails exactly how I like them and the service is perfect I always come back. Definitely come here!!! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Horrible. 
I came in for a gel manicure and it chipped within days.
The owner's wife was so bitter about fixing my nails when I came back 3 days after originally getting them done- she clearly lacks customer service skills because she had the rudest tone and demeanor. 

Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Hailee or Jasmine are the only girls I would recommend. Had a horrible experience with Johnny... cut my cuticles multiple times. Seemed so nervous and high strung. Not sure if he understood how to do a pink & white set exactly, seems like he didn't have much experience with it. Took over an hour for him to complete it explained my nails were crooked, not enough white acrylic.. I asked to correct it, he tried until he said it was too late. I showed him previous pictures to try and make him understand my nail was crooked because he wouldn't admit it. He said the look I wanted was completely different .. no, I just wanted them to be straight. 
I told him I appreciated his time and patience ( no answer) I'm assuming he was frustrated. Then told me another girl would finish my nails. I've never felt more embarrassed and uncomfortable. I've had my nails done for over 10 years and have never had this experience. After I told him my feedback on his work he continued talking in (a language I can't interpret). Is costumer service a thing anymore? 
They made me feel stupid and uncomfortable I will not be back. I'd rather pay more and go to Polished Too or Creative Nails across town. Thanks but no thanks. 

Update: the owner contacted me and apologized, I may consider her offer in coming to Hailee but for a pedicure most likely. And to clarify Hailee did discount my service and apologize before I left which was very appreciated."}
{"text":"The salon's recent renovations are simply gorgeous and high end. I've been a client if Tina's for awhile and she always does a great job on my mani/pedis. She knows how hard I work and she makes sure my experience is relaxing and that I leave feeling pampered. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Best nail shop I've been too. Great service and friendly staff. I really recommend this place.. :)"}
{"text":"Super happy! Hailee did an excellent job & really paid attention to what i requested! I got a new set and chrome done! Beautiful!"}
{"text":"First off, I'd have to say that the lounge is beautiful! You can definitely tell that the owner put in a lot of work to make the shop look so chic.

For the work done, I got a fill and shape change while my boyfriend got the paraffin spa pedi.

Hailee did my nails and I'd have to say I am loving it! I can't stop looking at them. It seems pretty simple but I do love the detail. It's like a pinky nude marble design. I saw that Hailee did way more work on my nails compared to other nail shops. The result? Perfectly shaped nails! I honestly feel like the next time I go again, I might just ask her to do whatever she feels like because her work is amazing!

As for the pedicure, my boyfriend loved it and felt they really try to make you feel comfortable. In the end, he was completely satisfied with his feet feeling like a baby's butt!

Overall, I feel like this place puts in a lot of effort and pays attention to detail. The workers are really sweet and patient. We definitely will be returning.

Update: After a few weeks, about 3 of my acrylics started coming off and others were being chipped. I was so disappointed as I loved them at first, but this was the first time it has happened to me. I thank Hailee for her attention to detail, but I'm just not sure if I want to go back for the same thing to happen again."}
{"text":"I called the other day to check hours and the yelp page says open at 10:30 on Saturdays but it's 10:40 and no one is even here!! Annoyed as I came to this side of town especially. Won't even try them again."}
{"text":"Gorgeous Nails Lounge is located on Eastern and Pebble in the complex next to LVAC, the 24hr Starbucks, and Yogurtland! 

The first time I went to Gorgeous Nails Lounge was with my friend. She booked us an appointment ahead of time for two manicures. Right when you walk in, you can tell that the workers put a lot of time and effort into making their nail lounge look chic! The manicure tables are white with glass on top, the chairs are all really comfy, and there's a huge mirror on the right side of the wall so you can check yourself out while enjoying your mani/pedi! 

If you're ever planning to make an appointment, ask for Hailee! She was actually the person who did my friend's manicure and did an amazing job!! We were talking to Hailee the whole time while she was doing my friend's nails and she was so sweet. I ended up getting a gel manicure for $35 which isn't bad considering the gel lasted for a LONG time, and when I mean a LONG time, I mean over three weeks. Usually after two weeks, the gel will start peel, but nope, that stuff was not budging!! 

Now, fast forward about a month later. My boyfriend's sister wanted to get her nails done for the first time (she's 19, shocking, I know!) so I decided to take her to Gorgeous Nails Lounge. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Hailee remembered me!! My boyfriend's sister ended up getting a gel manicure for $35 and I just got a regular manicure for $15! 

The service is great, the ambiance is perfect, and their playlist is poppin' too!!! I'm pretty sure I have found my regular nail spot."}
{"text":"Tina is absolutely amazing! She is SOOO  catering to you, and pays attention to detail. This is the BEST over all nail experienced I've had in years! Go see her!"}
{"text":"Finally found a nail salon in Vegas! Extremely impressed. Hailee took her time on my nails she was extremely thorough and really really made them even and flawless. She did not rush she took her time and I'm extremely pleased! Pricing was also decent compared to other places that don't do as nearly a good job. 


UPDATE: Went back because my nails did not lift at all and looked just as flawless as when I left. Am seriously so grateful I found this place !!! Another amazing set of nails thank you Hailee!!"}
{"text":"Loved the way my nails came out ! The shape is great and the place is very clean and fancywould definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"Hailey just did an amazing job. I wanted my nails to look awesome for my 21st birthday & she rocked it out for me. Also Tina is amazing!! I am a returning customer and I'll always keep coming back!! Very beautiful place!"}
{"text":"I went to Hailee to get my nails done because I had an awful full set. She gave me a fill and changed the color and made them not as thick. Her mother don gave me an amazing pedicure with an extra 5 minute massage because my feet were dying from wearing heels all day. Everyone raved about Hailee and now I know why. She doesn't rush and is very good with detail. I recommend her furshure ! I never had a good nail girl until I met her! Thank goodness !"}
{"text":"This salon has just remodeled with the new management. You can get 20% off for grand reopening. I just got my nails done today with my favorite nail tech as usual, Hailee. She has been the best nail tech in Vegas that i have known so far. She is very friendly, nice, very talented, and always pay full attention to her work. I Definitely will recommend my friends to come here."}
{"text":"I've been going to Hailee at Gorgeous Nails Lounge for a year and a half and will never go to anyone else! Before I Hailee I tried many nail salons around that area, and have given them chances while going to Hailee to fix maybe a broken nail when she's busy, and every time I go ANYWHERE else I'm extremely unhappy! At Gorgeous Nails, you get gorgeous nails and excellent customer service. I come here not only because Hailee is amazing but because she becomes your friend. I can show her ANY picture and she doesn't exactly recreate it, but make it her own and way better! She can literally do any nail trend and nail art you want! The salon is beautiful and trendy and you can tell that your in good hands! They always take their time and do quality work. For the designs I get you would pay twice as much anywhere else. They make quality affordable. You won't get that anywhere else. Especially with the salons in that area they try to get you in and out as fast as possible, do half ass work, and don't care. You can feel the difference. Like I said go to Gorgeous nails and you will never be happy anywhere else but there! I love Hailee and all the other nail techs are amazing as well!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here to get our nails done. We set up an appointment with Jasmine and she couldn't have been nicer. They had everything set up for us so when we got here at our appointment time we didn't have to wait at all. Only my second time getting a pedicure but my feet feel great so I'll be coming back soon ."}
{"text":"This nail salon is so cute . As soon as u walk in you feel welcomed . They def take there time to do your nails which is a great thing. I love how my nails turned out . I will be coming here more often ."}
{"text":"Due to \"rave Yelp reviews\" I scheduled for a gel manicure. 

Manicure = okay. Nothing to warrant 5 stars. 

Salon gives $5 discount to customers who write positive Yelp review. Explains the 4.5 star rating ;)

Salon was dead when I arrived. 

Interior of salon does not look as glamorous as photos depict. Don't be fooled ~"}
{"text":"My usual nail guy couldn't fit me in I was freaking out as my nails were a mess I didn't get off work until 9:30pm. I found this place online and saw that they were open late and figured I would give them a try and I am so glad I did! Jackie was AMAZING! Awesome customer service, great conversation oh and did I mention my nails look awesome! I love that they are open till midnight certain nights that makes my life so much easier. They also have all the latest nail trends. I did the chrome gel French tip and absolutely love it. Will definitely be a repeat customer. Great salon great location."}
{"text":"Went there the first time and it wasn't bad. Only paid $65 for pedicure and gel manicure. The pedicure was kind of lame. Didn't quite get the calluses and massage was weak. But overall wasn't bad. Went back again pedicure was better (message was weak sauce). I ended up paying $95 for a better pedicure and gel manicure. Not even a few days later gel polish is chipping off! I go back on sunday (Google and a sign they have out front say they are open on Sundays from 11am to 5pm and I went at 1130am) they weren't open and I need my nails fixed. Let's just say I'm not going back."}
{"text":"I never post reviews and usually don't pay much mind to the validity of others' reviews. However, this place needed to be commented on. For my first appointment I requested Hailee since I saw her work on social media. I was told she was booked but I decided to go anyway and try another nail tech. When I showed up I was pleasantly surprised that Hailee freed her schedule for me. One week later I broke my nail (completely my fault). I was able to go in to get my nail fixed and Jasmine took care of me free of charge, completely to my surprise. The customer service that both Jasmine and Hailee showed me led me to decide that this will be the only salon I visit in LV!"}
{"text":"Great place for a pedicure!  I walked in and was taken immediately.  The tech who worked on me was friendly, considerate, and took his time.  My pedicure is perfect and I feel so relaxed!  Only $30!!"}
{"text":"Great service 
Super friendly staff
I love the entire atmosphere of the nail salon 
They really put in a lot of work with your nails, they took their time to make sure my
Nails looked great.
I would highly recommend them to anyone  looking for a new great nail salon."}
{"text":"Wow!!! I am in love with this place. Franz did a fantastic job on my nails! Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Went to another nail salon down the street that advertised they did nail art... Waited almost an hour to finally get just the pedicure done. Didn't really do what I asked but I could deal. Get to the seat to do my full set & they said they can't do the design I wanted... Called Gorgeous & he offered to stay open late & that that design is his speciality!! Super nice inside! Beyond clean! Comfy chairs! Funny as hell nail tech! Found my new place! 
Oh & when you call, the answering service even says \"hello Gorgeous!\"
 That's the kind of place that earns my business!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Owner is a class act! The employees here are absolutely delightful! I will never go any where else again! My nails and toe nails look perfect!!"}
{"text":"Worst nail experience I've ever had! I walked in because they advertise that they use Minx... But was told they don't have the lamp for Minx. Then after I decided to pick something else (a pretty OPI Polish I wanted on both my fingers and toes) they kept trying to convince me that wasn't what I wanted... They tried to convince me they could do something nicer in gel... \"Let me show you!\" I told them I just wanted simple fall colors and I really liked the OPI color... The lady said just let me show you and we can change if you don't like it\" after she showed me and I told her I didn't want the red blue and green sparkles mixed in with the gold and that I really wanted my original color she said well I Already did gel base coat... It has to be gel\". She was going to do an ombr√© gold glitter over a nude polish but I hated how she applied the glitter so I stuck with the nude... She did a shitty job and tried to use he dremel drill to clean it up (for the feet little bit she thought was messed up to begin with) then when she gave me a pedicure I warned her I had a cut on my toe... She said \"don't worry that is for me to take care of\"... She ended up putting a glossy top coat over my cut so now if you didn't see it before it catches your eye for sure! I couldn't have her take it off because I knew the nail polish remover would sting.  All but one of the employees were totally unprofessional and the entire experience was awkward... I will never step foot in there again! Be careful.... They have another location somewhere in the valley too..



Update: Only a week later and my gel polish is peeling off ... Just as I'm getting ready for a big event... Beyond upset!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been living in Vegas for 4 years and I've been bouncing around nail salons and I can say I finally found the one ! I found this gem on Yelp originally looking for chrome nails around my area but after seeing a lot of pictures at this particular salon I just HAD to get in.  The majority of the nails were done by Hailee so I requested her to do my nails and seriously she is a shaping Goddess ! I love coffin nails and no one has ever got them down the first time but Hailee took her time making sure everything was nice and even which I really appreciated .  The staff were all so funny and super sweet they go above and beyond to make everyone feel comfortable also everything was nice and clean .  I will definitely be back , I highly recommend this place ! Thank you so much Hailee I love my nails"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere and open late! The gals were awesome and took their time on our pedis. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just went to this place today for the first time. My new favorite nail salon in Vegas! I have tried a lot of different salons and the ladies that work here are very professional and attentive to every detail. Tina is amazing at pedicures! And Haley listened to everything I wanted and my nails look perfect ! The friendliest nail techs I've encountered. I will for sure be back :)"}
{"text":"Always a great experience.  Clean environment with sanitary tools.  We typically call ahead for a same day appointment which they always accommodate.  The location is ideal and I look forward to my manicures!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place for my parents & I to get mani/pedi's while we were on vacation. 

We didn't have to wait long at all once we arrived & fell asleep during our pedicures! Jasmine & Jonny made us feel comfortable, like we were old time friends.  

Once we finished pedi's, we moved on to hard gel manicures. The worked fast but good. I got gold glitter nails, and since there wasn't a matching polish for my toes Jasmine used 3 different colors to get it to match! My nails feel good, not like sometimes when I go other places and they file the nail beds so much that it hurts....this was perfect!  

This is my new place to do nails while I'm here in Vegas!"}
{"text":"When I got my nails done here the first time it was best acrylic set I've ever had done! I wish I could remember the name of the man who did my nails, but he had me laughing the whole time. My nails lasted at least 2-3 weeks before I went in again and it was the first time I've never had a nail pop off.

About two weeks ago I went in for a gel manicure. A newer nail artist had done my manicure and I was very unhappy with it. The paint was uneven, there were dents, and it didn't cover my whole nail. I didn't want to say anything because I'm not one to complain about these services, but I couldn't not. I went in the following day and both the owner and the staff who were there were so understanding and accommodating. They offered to fix the manicure, but because I was crunched for time they gave me a refund. I can't say enough good things about the new owner, we got to talking for a little bit and she is awesome! I'll definitely continue to come here, not just for the great acrylic sets but the great staff.

Also, the location is open, just undergoing a name change."}
{"text":"My best friend and I needed a girls day to get our nails done and this place was perfect for it, our nails look beautiful and they did a wonderful job! Also the customer service was on point.

 Forever coming back!!!"}
{"text":"They're under new management with remodel and the salon is js beautiful and very welcoming. I'm excited to see what it looks like in Jan. If you're looking for the best tech. Go visit Tina, she does an fantastic job & makes sure you leave satisfied. Her nail work is great & so is the service. Love my new nail tech home"}
{"text":"I chose dark purple acrylic, coffin shaped and it came out very nice and they shimmered in the sun and everything But...They only lasted a Week until they started falling off. The quality was pretty cheap, my boyfriend literally broke one of my fallen nails in half lmao. Sorry not worth $55.00."}
{"text":"Kayla was very friendly! Great service, almost asks if everything was okay. Offered water. Kayla is the new owner of Nail Bar! 5 stars"}
{"text":"This place was just OK, nails came out pretty but I did not enjoy the experience and atmosphere of this place at all. Never was a conversation initiated by the lady doing my nails and she just seemed like she was there but actually wasn't. She did cut my cuticle more than needed and it bled and was sore for a couple days; no fun."}
{"text":"Omg- came in with a Pinterest photo and got exactly what I asked for. Ask for Hailey, she's BOMB I will be a Client here for the rest of my days. #GoGorgeousOrGoHome"}
{"text":"New management now named Nail Bar. Still the best service! Kayla and Sama are awesome, always doing great job on my nails! Whenever I visit the Nails Bar, I get so relaxed especially after a long day at work. They have massage chairs that help me relax and their foot spa is truly worth trying. They have a large variety of nail colors and they do different types ( regular, acrylic, gel and powder). I've been a client of this place for quite some time now and I always go home happy. 
I highly recommend this place! Try them and you'll be delighted!"}
{"text":"i didnt really care to get the name of the person doing my nails.  it was aweful.  I got acrilic gel nails.  The look OK from first glance, but she made them super thick that I feel like my nails are little erasers?!?!  yeah its super thick so what?  so in like 4 days when my nails grew out a little, it was so apparent there was a gap.  Just 4 days.  Usually I can start to see a gap in about 2 weeks.  Also, I was surprised to see that she neglected to clean the inside of my nails.  It was filled with debris and lots of the gel was clogged up in there that I could not even clean it well by myself.  a lot of the gel spilled to the side of nail too:( 
Just moved to the area.  Will continue to search for my new favorite nail salon."}
{"text":"i tried it here first time, nail broke off in one week, chips and peeling within a week but I wanted to give it a 2nd chance and 2nd visit chipping happened next day, broken nail in less than a week and polish they say is gel polish seems like regular polish and very cheap looking. I don't care how nice the designs look in the pics its poor quality and only looks good first day. Nail tech was Haile.

Update: In response to Georgeous Nails Response:
This is wrong, I was happy with the job other salon did, never had a problem, I just wanted to try a salon closer to where I live and some different nail art other salon doesn't do."}
{"text":"Tina did a great job. She is super friendly and took her time. Ask for her!
Also the shop looks great with the new remodel."}
{"text":"First time here at Gorgeous Nails Lounge, after many references! It was amazing. The salon is so cute, and welcoming, and the girls take care of you! Jasmine was great! She made sure I got exactly what I wanted, and that I loved everything. Great experience, and definitely my new nail spot"}
{"text":"I tried this nail salon due to the convenient location off the highway from my commute. The owner did my nails and I was so impressed. He sampled colors for me until I found something I liked. He was even willing to order a particular color that I like. This place has great ventilation, good location, and is the most customer centric nail salon I've ever been to. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If your looking for a modern, clean, and quick nail salon come here! I came here with my mom and sister and they seated us quickly. Tina did my nails she is so funny! The owner seems to be very involved and takes care of his place. Overall loves the experience and will be back when I am in Vegas"}
{"text":"As a guy who has never been to get a manicure or pedicure, I was a little hesitant at first, but after walking in and getting settled, it was a very enjoyable experience.
Also Tina, the lady who did my nails, is hilarious."}
{"text":"I was around the area, so wanted to try a new nail salon. The reviews looked great, but come to find out there's a $5.00 incentive for a great review.  So that could explain why.  We made an appointment, and came a half hour early.  The pictures look beautiful online, but there needs to be some major upkeep (I.e. There pedicure chairs remote are stuck onto the chairs with some type of sticky glue, but they kept falling off, resulting in my arm
Being covered in whatever glue that was). 

Mind you, as I mentioned we came a half an hour early, I was originally down for a gel polish change on my hands, and one of the longer pedicures. Let me start with the gel, the gentlemen was on the phone the entire time, and did not even apply a nail base coat, which I've never seen before. I've worked at the top salons on the strip, and that's just odd to me. Worst gel polish change ever. 

Next, my pedicure. Super sweet lady, but she was distracted so the bowl overflowed onto the floor and my husbands socks got wet. From there, I was cut twice. After that, I was like just give me a polish change, and I skipped out on a full pedicure. Guess how long I was there for this entire catastrophe?  Two hours!!!!!!! Let's just say I won't be back.

Not to mention, they turned away about five clients that walked in. Maybe if they had more staff and didn't take two hours to do a polish change, they would be able to fit in more clients."}
{"text":"I've been coming here lately to get my nails and feet done and Hailee never disappoints! I've gotten my nails done about 3 Times, today would be my 4th and they come out great every time."}
{"text":"Been here twice and had Hailee work on my nails both times. There is no one/nowhere else I'd go to get my nails done than with Hailee at Gorgeous Nails Lounge. Hailee is extremely intricate with her designs and she gets them done in a very timely manner. Her work is always nothing short of amazing!"}
{"text":"My daughter took me here to try it out and I loved it. Everyone was so nice and did a wonderful job! Pricing is great and beats most places. Will definitely be back and referring others!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Jasmine did an amazing job on my nails! I got light pink coffin nails and I'm obsessed with them! She is very sweet and talkative! I recommend her!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here for a gel-pedi. Tina has done my service both times and she's such a doll. She really makes me feel comfortable & is very efficient in her work. Also this location is very peaceful... I'll be back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is my far are the best set nails I've ever had done anywhere. And I've had my nails done for over 2 decades. That's saying a lot. I'm picky. I retired from being a master stylist, so my judgement is credible. Jasmine is awesome, her French ombre was flawless."}
{"text":"Awesome place! I had an appointment for a fill with Jasmine and she was very quick, very thorough and super sweet. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Watched my girlfriend get her nails, it was like magic, didn't know what was going on 99.9% of the time but i do have to say Hailee did a FANTASTIC job on her nails, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We're here!  Can't give much information yet as he is just getting started. The salon is very pretty though, and lots of polish colors to choose from.
He's finishing up now and my daughter is delighted with her acrylic nails and pedicure."}
{"text":"Hailee is amazing!!! She does an amazing job and never disappoints. My go to nail shop in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Perfectionists at its finest and super friendly! Always people I look forward to seeing and always love my results!! Nick ho, Tina, and Haylee are my favorites! Thank you for the great service! Tina did a great job on my eyebrows! Definitely my favorite nail place"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and I ended up here because of the yelp reviews. They do offer $5 for reviews .The place is trendy, staff is friendly, and they did a decent job on my nails. I only got a regular manicure but I am not impressed. Not worth the 5 stars. The price is higher too, so the $5 is not really a reason to return."}
{"text":"This place is just \"ok\". Normally gel lasted me atleast 2 weeks and I get redone because of growth. My gel has chipped off by day 8 and I had to remove it Because it was peeling. There are better nail salons here."}
{"text":"Our new go to place! 

Very enjoyable (even for guys). Commendable service. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hailee is so good at what she does don't waste time going to other places she is top quality and works so hard so take care of her she deserves it and don't be cheap when tipping bc she is the best"}
{"text":"My new favorite nail salon!

I set up an appointment over the phone & upon arrival I was greeted right away.

After a few moments they brought me a bottled water & a variety of nail colors to choose from. 

Hailee then started working on my nails & she was gentle, sweet, yet very professional. She paid attention to every detail & made sure that my nails had no imperfections.

It was a great experience! The place was very clean, they played great music, everyone was professional & very passionate about their work."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and I thought it was about time I wrote a review!! I absolutely love Hailee. She's so sweet and amazingly skilled!! She's the only one I trust doing my nails. Hailee always understands what I'm asking for and I always come out with what I expected or even better!! For my pedicures, I always ask for Tina because she's awesome and so funny. I'm also very ticklish and I hate when people touch my feet. So I only allow Tina to touch them because she can handle how much I move  overall, I only come here because they're so good!! And the prices are just right too. You pay for what you get! Thank you Hailee for always being so accommodating!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place as a last minute appointment despite all the negative reviews. I thought I could at least get a decent set of nails that I saw on this page. I screenshot their nails I wanted versus the shape of the nails I wanted and took them into Jasmine. She walked me through each step while she was doing my nails to reassure me what was going on and I appreciated that. I did not like the final set at all but it was only $40 so I thought I'll just deal with it for a couple of weeks. Two days later the white is turning grey the top coat is peeling off and the nails are lifting as well. Safe to say I absolutely hate these nails, they are probably the worst Nails I've ever had. My fault for ignoring the negative reviews, THE GOOD DOES NOT OUTWEIGH THE BAD HERE!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing !!!!
Staff is the best this is my new favorite place. Johnny is so attentive please come and try  it"}
{"text":"I have been searching for a great nail shop in Las Vegas/Henderson area. I've been to five shops and did not like the way any of them did my nails so still on the hunt today was my first time at Gorgeous Nails Lounge beautiful shop very welcoming, Jasmine was so sweet she took her time and did a great job on my pedicure and Hailee did my nails and also did a great job. I recommend this shop for to everybody who wants great service and amazing work done!"}
{"text":"Visited this nail salon on a Friday evening. It was my first time here.I did a walk in because I really needed a new fill for an event I was going to the same night. When coming in the scheduled me to return in an hour. My appointment was at 7:15 but I was about 10min late. They started on me right away. 

The salon itself was super chic and modern! They had cute white chairs with furry pillows everywhere!! Super cute. It wasn't just an ordinary salon. 

I got my pedicure first. The one thing I really liked was that they used the pedi liners!! Not all nail salons do this & it was very sanitary of them. My pedicure was very relaxing. I loved how they shaped my toe nails nicely and paid attention to little details. This by far was my favorite pedicure. It wasn't rushed or anything. The Vietnamese lady I had was really thoughtful. I wish I got her name...

My nail technician was Jasmine! She was really sweet and was talking to me during my whole process. She always made sure I liked everything or if there was anything that I wanted her to fix. I got a fill and my nails look like a brand new set. I loved the way she shaped my nails.

I highly recommend this salon!! I'll be coming back again."}

{"text":"I go every two weeks to get my pedicure & wax done and Tina does a fantastic job. Tina is so extremely very friendly as soon as I walk in the door she is there to greet me. I will recommend my friends to the place..."}
{"text":"The salon was in a nice location. It had a cute design on the inside. I like that their hours are very flexible. I called to make an appointment and was able to get in for the next day. When I asked for pricing for a coffin shaped acrylic fill with gel they said it would be $35.  
When I arrived I didn't have to wait long. They didn't really have a good color selection at all. I ended up getting rose gold sparkles. My nails were finished within 35-45min my friend on the other hand was worked on for an extra 35min  she was getting a full set of acrylics. The man doing her nails was pretty rude. He first tell her to relax and then scolded her and told her to pay attention when she was \"too relaxed\" her nails ended up being extremely thick and lumpy. 
Once we were finished my fill ended up being $45 and her full was $50. I don't understand how the price changed from what I was told over the phone or how there was just a $5 difference between a fill and a full. (We practically had the same design. Sparkles and special shape) 
Sadly my nails which are gel chipped within a few hours (not even a day) revealing the under layer of polish."}
