{"text":"I came here last night just hungry. I wasn't really thinking too much of it because I've not had great experiences with other to go hibachi restaurants in the past. I got the chicken teriyaki with rice and veggies. I took it home to eat. I could smell it and I was so ready to eat it. I get home and it looks so good. My eyes definitely made me hungry. There are no words for how good this was. I highly recommend it and the staff is so nice. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"So different and tasty. The food is always fresh and delicious. I have tried to duplicate their vegetables at home, but can't do it. They make simple foods into a very appetizing meal."}
{"text":"Very good food! I was pleased with the service and how they gave you so much food for the buck! I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. My second time here. Food was great. Service is good too. It's express but everything is cooked fresh so it's not fast food. I am good with that though. Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"When we walked in, the place was clean, bright and had cool decor.  

We had warm friendly greetings as we walked into the door. 

Ordered two hibachi chickens and two teas.  Everything was hot and fresh.  

They also have a self serve sauce bar. 

They also have a small sushi menu."}
{"text":"I loved this place the first time I tried it and customer service was good. I just called in my order  and was put on hold for a few minutes and then when I gave my order and asked her to repeat it back (because I didn't want rice or certain veggies) she paused and very rudely repeated it back and hung up! Most likely will not return after this."}
{"text":"The best express hibachi in concord area for sure. Just a short drive from the hospital and highways! Greeted as soon as I came in, was helped immediately and food was prepared fresh on the grills for you to see! Awesome place, must try!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place at least 10 times since they opened a little over a month ago. I really wish they'd open the full Miyabi experience nearby as well. I love the interior or this location. Very clean and up to date designs. The view when you 1st walk in automatically puts you at ease. When you walk in you are greeted with a Welcome from everyone. One of my favorite thing is that I can get my receipts emailed to me. I really don't know why this isn't a more widespread option by now. The portions are nice though I do wish they'd give you more veggies. Even in the side veggies, for almost 3 bucks i'd expect a bit more. But the food is absolutely delicious. Everything tastes fresh and even the Chefs behind the cashiers are friendly. They serve Filet Mignon as an option and you get plenty of steak! I have been a long time fan of Miyabi and they have single handedly ruined my diet since they opened."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Great food,  friendly and helpful staff. Clean and cozy. Highly recommend"}
