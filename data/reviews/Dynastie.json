{"text":"Stopped by for lunch since they have a well priced lunch menu. Beautiful decor and very clean! We ordered the vegetable plate and general Tsao dish. Decent food but slightly on the salty side."}
{"text":"The restaurant offers a variety of Chinese dishes. Some a little more saltier then I am used to (ginger lobster and shrimps). They do add nice little touches like a hot towel is served before eating and additional desserts other then the taro soup is given."}

{"text":"I couldn't believe that no one had written a review yet, so I just wanted to chime in quickly. 

My friend and I noticed this place when walking down the street from another Chinatown eatery and saw that they had stunning looking decor (at least from the window we were looking through). The place enticed my friend so much that he booked in for a Valentine's Day dinner, and said it was quite nice. I am looking forward to trying the cuisine myself, but in the meantime this is a review of how nice the decor is (a refreshing upgrade form some of the very generic places that have stood the test of time or even some new places) - still the food can be good or even great, despite boring decor - just saying it's nice when the bar is raised up a notch or three. 

Ok, now I'm getting hungry thinking about their menu, and the photo of a giant seafood basket I just saw on their home page. Until I try the grub, I'll leave the four stars, and even could be five for just their decor (pretty dazzling lights, bright linens and intricate looking wall panels)."}
{"text":"Love this place, never been disappointed, extremely fresh seafood, they have geoduck clams, giant lobsters (range from 1 1/2pound to 6 pounds) and if you really want to splurge, they have live king crab, they sometimes have live grouper and live turbot but they always have live tilapia and green bass. The stir fried black bean clams, steamed oysters (order both black bean and garlic), Hong Kong style lobster and fried porc chop (anise salt) are my go to when I go there, the steamed fish is also good. The good thing is there open late so if it's late and you're looking for a good meal, this is a great option especially if you like seafood. If you really want to splurge, they have abalone, sea cucumber, shark fin and birds nest although if you want to have one of these Chinese delicacies, you will have to call in advance. No dress code and reservations aren't required."}
