{"text":"The service was good. The food was NOT so good. ! Highly overpriced for the quality of the menu... sorry!"}
{"text":"Terrific food, bartender remembers what you drink, clientele is somewhat shifty looking. Get the Columbian platter, so much food! It's pretty close quarters, you may need to share a table with other people, but everyone is friendly. Football is always on the big screen and the selection of beers covers everywhere south of Phoenix. It's noisy, crowded and really authentic."}
{"text":"The food was ok but service was horrible. When I ask for extra lime the waitress rolled her eyes at me. She had a lot of attitude the whole time. Never coming back!!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, messed up on my delivery order and then would not give a refund. Very rude when calling to deal with the missing items."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my coworker. The service was great. The waitress was friendly and our food came out quick. The food was good and more authentic than chain restaurants like mucho burrito. The portion size is good. I got there lunch menu burrito and it was good...just needs a bit more sauce on the inside but I'm sure you could ask. I would come back to try other items on there menu."}
{"text":"The best Latin food we've had in town! Lots of Mexican and Salvadoran food, but also Colombian. So good. My partner is Colombian and thought what we had (Picada, a platter of a little of everything) and the queso fundito was so right.   The service was stellar and the prices were fair. I'm highly recommend it if you're a fan of Mexican/Latin American food."}
{"text":"Sign says open, doors unlocked, about an hour from the 10pm closing time...just got told they are closed and they can't serve me. It really sucks as I have been looking forward to trying pupusa for a while.   At least turn ur open sign off if ur closing early. Not impressed with that."}
{"text":"This Restaurant definitely uses authentic fresh ingredients. The Food is amazing !if your looking for some Authentic Latin-American Dinners in Calgary check this place out !!!! :)"}
{"text":"The nachos here are amazing. So fresh and not greasy and over loaded with cheese.   We always come here for papusas. There's a large variety.  It's a small family restaurant, love supporting the small ma and pas."}
