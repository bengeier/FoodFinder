{"text":"The atmosphere is cool. The people are pleasant. We ordered the Tavern Salad and some ribs. The Tavern Salad, I have to admit is awesome, but the ribs were too tough. I have had way better ribs in my lifetime. I will stay away from the ribs and will frequent this joint when I have a taste for a quick salad."}
{"text":"We stopped by because they have a selection of $4 drink specials on Saturday (Absolute, Bombay Sapphire, etc.). I am more of a wine drinker, but I didn't object.   For a small, local restaurant/bar, the atmosphere is pretty lively. I like the exposed brick throughout the dinning area. And they have karaoke starting at 10pm on Saturdays.   I ordered the smoked & grilled chicken wings appetizer as my meal. Two of my friends ordered the wing platter which came with 1 side (such as fries, mashed potatoes, or a side salad) along with a small serving of cole slaw and baked beans. Both of my friends really enjoyed the wings; however, I wasn't as impressed. The wings were just okay. I probably wouldn't order them again. They didn't have much flavor and they were more chewy than crispy.   Another friend ordered the blackened chicken sandwich with fried onions and a side of their fresh cut fries. She enjoyed her sandwich and we both enjoyed her fries (she let me taste one :-). They are cut fresh in-house. Note to the chef: they would be really good with some Lawry's seasoning salt on them! :-)   Our waiter, Tommy, was excellent. He was very attentive and personable. He made this a memorable experience. Overall, this place is okay.  The food is edible and the service was good.  But with new restaurants constantly opening in the area, this place better step it up."}
{"text":"I am visiting the area. I don't like chain restaurants so this place was a great find. I had the beer can chicken. Moist and tasty. Great green beans and mash potatoes leaving one to desire seconds. Happy to have discovered!"}
{"text":"Had Dinner there last night and ate at the bar.  I had the Brisket and Melinda had the port shoulder.  Both meals were very good and tasty.   While they had a couple of beer selections I would have expected more selections for a place call a Tavern.   Also Melinda wanted a cup of hot tea and they don't serve it.  It was odd that they have iced tea and they could have just poured it and put it in the microwave.  Odd!  Overall I would go back.  Overall 3 Beers, two generous portion meals for $40."}
{"text":"I have driven past this place many times and always though it looked cool on the outside. Last weekend my gf and I were at Concord Mills and decided to grab some lunch.  I had a terrible experience and feel bad for taking my gf there because I know she deserves better. First, the hostess was poorly dressed and looked like she had just roller out of bed. Then, the food was mediocre, it seemed as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while. I order the BBQ sandwich, I am a big fan of BBQ, I like all types and am very rarely disappointed with BBQ but this BBQ was not good. It just seemed like tasteless pork covered in sauce with a few cold fried pickles on top.  Needless to say, I won't be back again."}
{"text":"Fun & friendly staff. Very DELICIOUS food. Hubby had chili burger, MELT IN YOUR MOUTH WONDERFUL. I had Blacked chicken Caesar salad, awesome! Even the kids chicken tenders are flavorful & juicy. Highly recommend this tavern."}
{"text":"This is one of the few non-chain restaurants in the wasteland of Hell commonly known as Concord Mills. I would rate it as subpar for the price. The food was quite average. Wedge salad was ok, lots of bacon and blue cheese, but only 3 cherry tomato halves. The cheesesteak was nothing to write home about. The beer battered fish was obviously straight from a box in the freezer. Fries were already limp on both plates when delivered to the table. Service was slow, even though the restaurant was mostly empty. The blinds by our booth were covered in a thick layer of dust, and there was a lot of food debris on the windowsill. This might be a decent place to catch a sporting event on tv, but I wouldn't recommend it if a good meal is your only objective."}
{"text":"With all the chain restaurants in the area, I wanted to give a non-chain a go.  This place stood out, so that's where I ended up.  Upon entering the establishment, there was a very pleasant odor in the air, and that was a good start.  The wait staff was quite possibly the friendliest I have ever experienced anywhere, as was evident from the first \"hello\".  I ordered the smokehouse wings with BBQ sauce and an order of handcut fries.  Both ended up being fantastic.  The atmosphere was great with TVs all around, and it was just a great time from beginning to end.  I will definitely return here when in the Charlotte area and look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Club sandwich is good. Fries are not my favorite but ok. Service is good. Natalie the bartender is pleasant and attentive. Will defintely be back."}
{"text":"I came on a Mon night & it was almost dead. The service was good, not great. I ordered the Catamount, bbq sandwich, it was overcooked, salty, & left it much to be desired. The fries were so greasy, you can see what type of oil they used, soggy, & again, not my choice to have. My husband enjoyed the Chili Cheese Burger, but he was hungry, does that count? I'll give it another chance another time."}
{"text":"Ate dinner there last night.  I have to say, Yelpers, you let us down.  I had the smoked turkey dinner.  When the plate showed up with 4 strips of \"turkey\" smothered in BBQ sauce, I knew this was not going to be a stellar meal and i wasnt wrong. When i say \"strips\", they were literally perfectly rectangular slices the size of a strip of bacon.  The turkey was disappointing, the fries were warm (not hot), kind of soft, and definitely came out of the freezer. My fianc√©e had the chicken special - chicken stuffed with spinache, pimento cheese, and served over mashed potatoes. He liked it.  For 2 entrees and 2 beers, That was not $45 well-spent. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Ok. So the wife and I just checked this place out for lunch. My wife has gluten issues so was careful as to what she ordered. She decided on the pulled pork plate. She did ask the waiter if the bbq sauce was thickened with or used flour un any way. As he was not sure he asked the kitchen an promptly returned with an answer....so far so good.  I ordered a burger with a jalepeno pimento cheese on it along with fried green tomatoes, red onions and shoestring fries. Our orders were ready and at our table shortly.  My burger used good quality meat and was cooked without being dried out. The fried green tomatoes were good as well, but to refer to the pimento cheese as having anything to do with jalepenos is a sin. Sure there was a slight hint...as if a jalapeno was waved over the the bowl the pimento cheese was in.  So we have a fail on the burger....which would have been fine except for the non-existent jalapeno.  The fries were nice and crispy.  Now on to my wifes plate.   This was the pulled pork plate, served with slaw and baked beans. They did allow her to sub fries for the toast usually served with this dish. The fries were good as mentioned before, the bbq pork left something to be desired though. The sauce seemed bland and the pork was almost mushy, as if it had sat in a warming tray a bit to long. The baked beans were nothing to write home about either. I prefer Shanes or even Smokey Bonez over this place, and they are both pretty average.   So to sum it up I'd rate the service as a \"B\" or 4 star.. It was at least competent... The food should rate \"C\" or  maybe even a \"D\" or 2  1/2 stars.     Oh well we have been wanting to try this place out for a while.  It was a bit if a diappointment though"}
{"text":"We just had lunch on the way back home to Danville VA and just had to try the food at Tavern at the Mills!! I am glad we did! The food was very good, the atmosphere was fun and upbeat, and the staff was really friendly!! We will definitely drive 3 hours for the food... Next time u would like to try the smoked chicken wings and the prime rib!!!!"}
{"text":"You can read my tip in yelp but this place is awesome great smoked food and delicious drinks. Excellent staff definitely coming back, maybe tomorrow lol."}
{"text":"Excellent DYs cheesesteak. Best I've ever had. I go out of my way to stop here and get the cheesesteak. The Nachos are great to order and share too, if you're not too hungry."}
{"text":"Honestly the best wings I've had in a long time. All the sauces are made in house, they were smoked and grilled to perfection in my opinion. Very friendly staff that helped out really well with the menu.   I also had the burger and onion rings, very good, meat was cooked exactly the way I ordered it. Onion rings are beer battered and made in house. Service was great all around and menu prices are very fair.   I found my new \"wing spot\" definitely recommend to all.   I gave it 4 out of 5 only because I've had better burgers but It was a very tasty burger and definitely worth trying. Juicy thick meat."}
{"text":"A group of us went Saturday during the race. The place was practically empty and we sat in the bar area. For the first bit we had a waiter with a mohawk. He was wonderful! He was very attentive and quickly refilled our drinks. When he left we were left with a guy who looked like he belonged in the movie Grease. He was horrible! We had to constantly get his attention and sometimes walk up to the bar to get the drinks ourselves. Considering we were in the bar area and there was only one other group I found that ridiculous. When we were ready to order food we had to wait for him to stop socializing with his coworkers and come back to his section. As for the food, I got the Caesar salad and that was horrible. There was too much dressing and the chicken tasted disgusting. Fortunately, the wings and cheesesteaks that my friends ordered were delicious. I won't be back."}
{"text":"In town for the race and we were driving around looking for lunch and happened upon this place. I had fish and chips that were great. My buddy had a barbecue sandwich and he said it was very good. It has a nice pub atmosphere and the staff was friendly and good. I would recommend it and come back again."}
{"text":"Stopped here after shopping at concord mills. Ate the blue devil sandwich and tavern fries. The food was good. Would definitely eat here again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I was here back in February.   I cannot stop thinking about it and want to plan another trip from Greenville, SC back up there to eat here again.  We were staying at Great Wolf Lodge a mile down the road and stopped in for lunch.   BURGER here was the best I have ever had in my life!!!   Came back next day for dinner, and I am not a huge prime rib guy, I have it once every few years...  This was one of the best things I have ever eaten.  Every time I watch something on Food Network/Cooking channel and see either a Burger or Prime Ribe, I think about planning a trip up to Concord, just to eat there...  Worth a trip to Concord just to eat here, forget the outlets..."}
{"text":"Meh...that is essentially my entire sentiment on this place. Spinach artichoke dip was lacking seasoning & I suspect it was canned spinach as it was watery. I got the Wolfpack salad & it was one of the better items from what our table ordered. Did get the dressing on the side & am thankful for that as the BBQ ranch was not good. Tavern burger was terrible- the jalapeno pimento was gobbed all over perhaps to hide the fact the burger was overcooked & underseasoned. The smoked turkey looked like thick lunch meat? One of the better items I had here was the mint on the way out the door. Im not impressed & if you are in the area, I'd recommend driving around a little to see your other options."}
{"text":"I am in the area to attend a concert and stumbled upon this place on Yelp. I had wings and my boyfriend had a chicken quesadilla, both delicious. I also had an amazing pumpkin ale, garnished with brown sugar, but I can't remember the name (it was suggested by our waiter). The menu was small, but we were satisfied with our choices, overall great experience."}
{"text":"Met a few girlfriends after work today from 4-6 for drinks and appetizers. Tavern Website says 1/2 price apps on Friday from 3-6 so ordered spinach dip- was very tasty but we were surprised when bill came and dip was full price. We opened the website on our phones, showed the server, and asked about it. He responded that half price apps means you get a smaller portion and that he didn't think they do that anymore anyway. We didn't want to argue and let it go but just BEWARE- if you go in for an advertised special, be sure to ask about it before you order!"}
{"text":"Pleasant dining experience.  The service was the highlight of our evening as our server recommended some nice choices.  Pretty standard fare, good BBQ.  Seemed a bit pricey for what it was though.  The misses ordered the chicken and raved about it.  I thought it was good...but I've had better barbecue.  The atmosphere is completely ready for watching the big game, though, as every wall had no less than 3 tv's!"}
{"text":"We came in Friday night and were waiting about a minute to be seated because no hostess was there. Once seated we sat there for almost 10 minutes or more before a waitress came over to ask for our drink order. The group that came in after ours already had drinks before our waitress came over to ask for our drink order. She said she had not be told her table had been sat. Food arrived promptly which we started to think made up for the hiccups earlier but then we had to wait almost 15 to 20 minutes after we had finished eating to get our check. We've been here many times and we always want to give it another try even though there's always some type of problem with the service. After this time I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here to try a new spot near the mall.  It was a nice spot, but the menu and food left a lot to be desired.  Neither me or my friend were impressed by the either.  I ordered a pulled pork sandwich.  It was MEH.  I ate it, but it left me with the, \"I wish I didn't waste my meal out for the day\" out on \"that\" feeling.  My friend's meal was also sub par.  I won't be back to eat, but maybe for a beer or two."}
{"text":"Located across from the Concord Mills Mall. The place is quaint and reminiscent of an old Chicago type establishment (though this in NC), with a brick interior and exterior. The service was very good and the food was fair. They have a bar, with a fairly good list of beers and wines. They also had a few tables located outside. The french fries were fresh (cut from fresh potatoes and not frozen), but needed to be a bit more crispy or seasoned. The smoked turkey was very good, but the BBQ sauce was too vinegary. The baked beans were very good and only wish they were not served in one of those tiny side cups. The prime rib was exactly how my husband likes it. Though surprised to see a horseradish sauce, rather than real horseradish. They do serve very large amounts, so expect to take home leftovers, which we could not since staying in a hotel. Parking is located behind and limited. This was a good change of pace in a sea of chains. I would dine here again."}
{"text":"Terrible! The wings were good, but the Prime Rib was awful it was cold (because they keep the meat in the re-fridge - day or night) and then 'warm' it up it seemed with the very SWEET Aju sauce. The staff (manager) must be burnt out, all she wanted to do was put the food on the table & run back to her conversation with the bartender and one other worker. As if WE were INTERRUPTING her 'Down Time'. When she was told that the food was not right she just ran off & left everything on the table to get back to her conversation with the bartender.  We were the only customers in the place so it was not like she had to rush to wait on other tables, just her buddies conversation & the TV at the bar. Horrible place to go and I will not go back."}
{"text":"Best wings in my neighborhood of Highland Creek. Good BBQ and great atmosphere. Try the smoke wings."}
{"text":"After eating here several times, I would say this place isn't  somewhere I would recommend to anyone, nor is it a place I would say, OH NO! Don't go there.  The food is overpriced for what it is and tends to come out as run of the mill, chain restaurant food.  The only thing I really enjoyed was the pimento cheese, rather tasty, but not worth a trip out there on its own, lol."}
{"text":"First experience here was a good one.  Came here after work to meet a few co-workers and catch up.  They were very accommodating for a big group by pushing a bunch of tables together.  We were anticipating 10 people but about 7 people showed up total.  Wednesdays were 1/2 price wine bottle days so it was a good thing.  I ended up drowning my work sorrows with 22oz beers.  Had the blackened chicken Monterrey sandwich with fries and killed the whole thing (including crumbs).    A bit of an odd place to \"go out drinking\" but it serves drinks and decent food.  A great dinner/meeting place to blow off steam after work, or maybe a hard day at Concord Mills."}
{"text":"Were in town for Great Wolf Lodge stay and tried this place for dinner.  It was perfect. No wait  for nine people on a Saturday night and the food service was fantastic and good value.  I had the special, New York strip and wings. Yum. My friend had their pork shoulder special but rub with a side of wedgie!"}
{"text":"On my quest to find the best salads near my office in Concord. I've eaten here twice because they have a really good wedge. It's a HUGE portion covered with home made blue cheese, fresh bacon and cherry tomatoes. The second time I came, I asked for the dressing on the side so I wouldn't be tempted to swim in it.   Service is good and the price for the salad is terrific! Six bucks I think. The iced tea was good, too.  Adding this to my yelp list for Best Salads in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Tired bar with tired staff and tired food.  I am lucky to sit at the bar with a rather attentive bartender. Service was fast enough but the food was so so. I had their brisket and it was tough piece of meat. Felt like I was eating a plank. It was hard, flat , dense, dry and felt like i was chewing thru wood.  Can;t say I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here! I have tried the nachos (messy but delicious), barbalo wings (tavern's own sauce, a mix of buffalo and bbq), burger and philly cheese steak sandwich. Everything has been delicious. Peanut butter pie for dessert... yum!   My only issue with the place is that i have been on many different nights and it always seems to be karaoke night. This presented a problem last time i visited and the server got my order wrong because he couldn't hear.  Other than that, it's a great place!"}
{"text":"I've only had the smoked prime rib with veggies and mash. I've had it quite a few times and always enjoy it. I've never seen this dish anywhere else but it could just be that I'm still new to the area. The price is awesome for so much food and the bartender is nice. Good service but it's always pretty empty when I'm there. The only negative is that I like my steak rare and it comes out that way only one out of 4 or so times. The kitchen isn't consistent with steak temperatures. Still tasty!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere...  The bartenders were lacking.  This would be a cool place to get up for a game, but not recommended for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my family while traveling. It was filthy and the food was salty and awful."}
{"text":"Sad to say they closed permanently on April 30, 2015   Great food and really great service. The beef brisket is amazing.  Great fried pickles. great wings. Fish, so so stick with the beef , pork and chicken. One of our favorite restaurants an so so so much better the the chain restaurants"}
