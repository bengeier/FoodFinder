{"text":"Some of the best gyros I've ever had! If you're a fan of Mediterranean food you should definitely should give this truck a try!"}
{"text":"Warm hospitality and fresh tasting food. I enjoyed this food truck at the Arizona Balloon Classic in Good Year, Arizona. The cashier was giving out samples of hummus and baba ghanouj on homemade pita chips.

I ordered the veggie bowl: hummus, saffron rice, eggplant, beet salad. All the food was fresh tasting. I really loved the sweet and tangy beet salad that was topped with Kalamata olives. I also added gyro meat which was a different take on the dish. The meat did not come from a spit but had a homemade feel, made from lamb and beef and spiced.

Their cucumber infused water was so tempting. For two dollar, all you can drink, it was a steal at a festival."}
{"text":"After working the Gilbert Farmers market today, I was lucky enough to find some food trucks still open at the close of market. I chose Mediterranean Majik since that style of food is my favorite. I only wanted something small and settled on the fattoush salad. DELICIOUS!! Really crunchy fresh , not soggy from the tasty dressing. The beets and I believe mushrooms, were definitely a nice added touch. I look forward to trying some of the other items on their menu soon. The owner was very personable and attentive."}
{"text":"Best food ever! I tried the falafel sampler and it was super good and fresh! I also got to sample the mushroom fries and balsamic ketchup  (even if you're not a fan of mushrooms you have to give these a try they are SO GOOD) and I am still dreaming of them. My 1 year old loved everything too, from the falafel to the hummus and saffron rice. Great customer service as well, everyone was so friendly, I can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Awesome! Incredible. Customer service was top notch! Such kind people. I'll go to food truck Friday west valley every time they're there!"}

Lots of happy people, check them out and Stephanie is a great cook!"}
{"text":"Very good food. The fattoush was delicious and the garlic sauce was very good."}
