{"text":"They published an ad declaring that if a customer doesn't think it's the best pizza ever, it's free.  Well, we tried it and the pizza was mediocre at best.  I didn't bother getting my money back but I should have."}
{"text":"Sub par pizza and terrible seating combined with bad service: the only saving grace from the 1 star is the beer selection."}
{"text":"I had ordered pizza here many times to my liking. They have great food. That being said, I have never in my life had worse service. I ordered pizza, wings and bread sticks. When the food arrived it was ice cold and they forgot my bread sticks. I called and they apologized and issued me a $40 dollar credit. The manager said that it was unacceptable and he would do whatever to make it right. I thanked him for his attention to the matter. I just called for a delivery of a pizza using my $40 credit. They then told me they will not deliver on a credit. Worst pizza shop around. Go to Messina's on Middle Rd. They actually care about their customers."}
{"text":"There are very few good restaurants on Route 8, so my expectations weren't high when this new pizza shop came into the neighborhood. We ordered delivery (which was a 45 min wait) We figured it must be good if they have so many others ordering at the same time. The pizza came and it was good, not the best I've had but good."}
{"text":"Terrible 
This place was a waste of time and money.  Ordered 2 pizzas, chewy and rubbery. Waitress could not describe anything on menu, she had to keep going back to kitchen to get answers for us. We witnessed another waitress sitting on a table while taking a customers order, sorry but, tables are for glasses, not @sses. Also ordered 4 different types of wings the sauces were all basically the same. Also you must pay .75 per celery and .75 per ranch or blue cheese with your wings. Unprofessional, overpriced and just not good. It's a shame that sub par food and service is the new normal."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Friday night at 7:30. Waited behind a couple for a table. The couple left after a few minutes and told us they had been waiting for a while. We stood around for a while longer . THE server actually stopped by and said she would seat us in a few minutes. We observed a lot of frustrated looking customers either trying to order or trying to pay. I only noticed one person handling the whole restaurant. It's not a big place, but she was completely overwhelmed. We left without getting a table after 15 minutes. There were several tables available.  Can't comment on the food yet, but the place was reasonably busy."}
{"text":"My gf and I waited over an hour for pizza and wings. Three couples who were sat fifteen minutes after us or more were done with their meals before we even got ours. Our waitress legitimately didn't check on us after seating us and getting our first drink. After complaining, she wouldn't even look in our direction. They paid for our meal but I wasn't looking for that. Just wanted to get good to mediocre service. This was by far the worst service I ever had. It's not even close.  The manager tried to make it right, but I'll spend my money elsewhere. Get waiters and waitresses that care. They are killing your business."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience. Have ordered wings a few times for take-out in the past and thought they were pretty good.   Mondays are wing nights so we thought we would eat in for a change.  

The wait for food was entirely too long (40+ minutes) and they weren't even that busy.  Not sure if they changed their wings.  They were supposed to be half wings but were incredibly skinny / small.   My son ordered a calzone. Very bready, thick crust.  They only have plastic wear making very difficult to eat.  And they leave the supply of plastic wear on the tables which is not very sanitary and actually gross. Overall not very happy with the experience.  May still order take out. Haven't decided."}
{"text":"Wait time is horrendous.  Pizza is inconsistent.. as if there is no standard week to week.  Ordered two pies one week, exactly the same..the cheese was different colors.  I expect much more for premium price pizza."}
{"text":"Need to work out the bugs. They don't seem to be prepared for busy nights. Long wait unacceptable. Haven't tasted the pizza yet."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The food is awesome, and the beer selection is top notch. Specials every day, and reasonable prices overall. The one downside is the size and service. They are a small restaurant with  only about ten tables, so you may have to wait, but it is totally worth the wait. If you mind waiting, avoid coming between 5-7 on wee knights. It is better in the warmer months, as they have a patio for relaxing with food and drinks. However, any issue with waiting is made up for with the amazing food. Carry out service is available, for beer and their whole menu. The dough is amazing, and you can tell that it is fresh made. Overall, an amazing experience. Nothing by here tastes mass produced,  and that is hard to find."}
{"text":"Been to Calientes approximately 10 times.  This bar/restaurant is suppose to have the best pizza...  The first pizza we had was great...  It had sausage and a medley of peppers.  It was truly very good.  I would say a four or five star.  However they don't make that pizza all the time.  Pizza has progressively gotten worse with each new one we have tried.  Bring back that pizza.  We may go one more time... beer needs to be colder."}
{"text":"If you like fingernails in your food and the owner lying to your face about trying to compensate you then this is the pizza shop for you. It's an inferior pizza recipe but it was close to my work so I occasionally payed their higher than average price for convenience, well that was until my daughter took a bite of pizza and had a fingernail in it.. I called the shop and they refused to reimburse me and called me a liar.. a month later an employee there asked me to come back and offered me a free pizza as an apology.. when I tried picking up my pizza the owner got in my face and kicked me out of his place.. like I stated earlier if you like fingernails in your food and crappy service this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Called to place a pickup order and waited 10 minutes on hold listening to the most annoying please hold recording over and over. Needless to say once the young lady finally decided to pick up I had no interest in placing an order and giving them my money."}
{"text":"Small, loud, rude hostess, only tall tables.  No height chairs..... Not family friendly at all!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. One of the top pies in Pittsburgh.  Beer Selection is excellent and the wings are excellent.  The square pie is our favorite and you can order Ricotta on your pie.  The only complaint is that the table service is hit or miss depending on the server.  Some are great and others tell you their life story and forget to bring your beer."}
{"text":"I had always just thought of this as a beer place that had some food. That's because it has one of the best craft beer selections in the area. Only one place in Wexford is better. Had never considered the food. Brought the kids here for pizza and burgers and it was very good. Definitely a place to try out."}
{"text":"Waited for quite a while to be waited on. Probably 10-15 minutes. She took a drink order and had to ask to please take entire order as I didn't want to wait again. Ordered a $9.99 buffalo chicken sandwich. Says it comes with fries and cheese on it. I asked for no cheese but instead of cheese substitute out a little lettuce instead. After a wait the sandwich comes out and is handed to me and the person leaves immediately. Never asked if there was anything else I needed. Typically when the runner delivers the food they ask that. It would have been helpful as the sandwich didn't have any lettuce like I asked. I waited 10 minutes and my server never came back. It seemed obvious that something wasn't right because I sat with food and didn't eat any. I finally asked the server working with the folks beside me to please get lettuce for me. Seems like a petty thing perhaps, but it's how I ordered the food.  Then when I get my bill the sandwich rang up at $11.38?? Not sure what that's about. I removed cheese and asked for lettuce. So if you up charge that's fine but it seems an odd amount, $1.39??? Didn't notice this until my card had already been swiped. 
I'm not sure I'll return which is too bad. Perhaps the other location is better. I went primarily for the beer selection. The sandwich wasn't bad once I finally got what I wanted, too bad it took so long for service and waiting for someone else to correct the error."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a recommendation from a friend. The pizza is the best around (better than olives and peppers) the crust is perfect and the sauce is spot on. We had the wings as well with dry rub - and it was a homemade rub - not the stuff that comes pre made. Great selection of beers in the cooler and draft. Also great service!"}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious.  Perfect crust (not soggy/not hard/just right).  And the Italian sub was fresh and yummy.  Perfect takeout pizza!"}
{"text":"OMG! As you may know pizza is my go to food and this place does not disappoint. I came here while visiting family who are frequent customers. The atmosphere is friendly, and fast. The craft and draft beer selection is great and they are free with samples. The pizza I had was fabulous and hand made along with the bread sticks. The food was fresh and tasty, staff friendly, a great neighbourhood place. If your ever in the Allison Park area stop in, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This has the potential to be a nice place.  Food was good but service was spotty. We were the only ones there and still has poor service"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Hampton's Caliente & liked it a lot better than the one in Bloomfield. The only thing that was a bit annoying was that there was one server on Sunday so it took some time to be waited on, which we understood & didn't blame the server for since he was running in and outside. We had the beer sampler, which we loved. For dinner we shared the buffalo fries (buffalo run not buffalo sauce which was very good) & two sets of wings with HI BBQ & Asian chili. We really enjoyed the wings. Every day they have different food & drink specials. They also have an extensive cooler where you can buy beer for there or to take home. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I struggled to even give this place one star. We ordered Parmesan hot wings and they weren't horrible but could have been a bit hotter (temperature). The beer selection was little light on IPAs. The waitress forgot our appetizer order and they brought the wings and pizza at the same time. We ordered Porky's Revenge pizza - basically meat lovers. It was supposed to be thin crust and it ended up being an undercooked doughy mess. The last straw was the waitress completely gave us and the couple we were with the wrong items on our tabs. One and done."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a restaurant in which you can avoid small children, this is the place for you.  On the other hand, if you have a young family and are looking for a laid back, family-friendly atmosphere to dine, go elsewhere.  My husband, toddler, and I a went there recently for dinner.  When we requested a high chair, the waitress/hostess looked at us with disdain and told us, \"there's probably one outside.\"  My husband went in search for it and found it was being used by someone else.  He then had to search for a staff member to ask for another; he was informed the restaurant only had one.  We could have a booster seat if we wanted it.  He then had to search for another staff member to request a booster seat.  After ten minutes of this kind of neglectful treatment by the wait staff, we left.  While I understand not all restaurants are family friendly, the undeniable lack of concern for patrons' needs was disappointing.  I can't comment on the food or beer selection as we didn't stay to enjoy any of it.  We will never eat at this restaurant again, with or without our child."}
{"text":"I tried all the pizzas up and down Rte 8 North.
This is without a doubt the best. Crust just
right. Toppings fresh. No soggy center."}
{"text":"Not a favorite.  We have been here 4 times with no improvement.  Great beer selection but, over priced bar food is not a hit..."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and wonderful pizza.  The service is pretty good, too.  One thing I don't like is the music is way too loud, it's hard to have a conversation.  Not sure why they use plastic plates, it would be a little nicer if they used real plates."}
{"text":"Ended up here on a Saturday night as the dinner spot we had wanted to go to had a super long wait. 

I have never been here before and didn't even know this place existed even thought I've been in the shopping plaza on Route 8 where it sits many times. Caliente is at the end of a shopping plaza in a small brick building. I wasn't sure what to expect, but Fiance always drove by it and wanted to give it a go. 

Caliente is seat yourself and there are only a few tables inside the small space, but it wasn't overly crowded at all. We sat down right away and the hostess and waitress were both super friendly and very attentive. We didn't have to wait for menus or water. Its a standard American bar food type of place - they have wings, burgers, good beer selection, sandwiches and award winning pizzas. There are also \"rolls\" on the menu with super tasty flavors like jalapeno, cheddar bacon, buffalo chicken, and pizza. I think I would head back for those alone. They looked really good. 

We started with their standard medium hot wings -they were really good - not greasy, super hot and fresh, crispy and not battered. They were even thrown on the grill at some point as well and had some spots of tasty char on them. The wing sauce was good - flavorful and not overly spicy and the homemade blue cheese was good also. 

Fiance went with the Hawaiian pizza and I had the bacon cheeseburger. My burger was really GOOD. Super juicy, cooked perfectly and not greasy. Their fries were also really good - whole, real potatoes and crispy. The pizza was also VERY good. The crust was chewy in the best possible way and also crispy on the bottom. The Hawaiian came with pineapple, ham AND bacon for added fun and calories. It was bomb.com. The food here is very reminiscent of Gateway Grill in Monroeville - really good burgers, fries, and pizzas. So, if you have been there and liked it, you will like it here for sure! 

One thing I will note is the volume of the radio/stereo system in this place - it was being turned SUPER high to the point that we had to shout at each other to talk and then it would be shut off completely, or turned down very low. It was a little annoying as it fluctuated throughout our whole meal, but nothing to stop me from coming back. 

This is a solid place for a dinner out if you are in the area and dont want the usual chains that sit all over Route 8. Definitely better and worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Food was very good, World pizza Champs and it tasted like it.  Fast, friendly service.  We have a large family and their newly remolded space was perfect them.  Wish every night was a Caliente Night!!  My moms favorite is the wings and she also loves their different flavor of fries.  I am excited to go back there again very very soon."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner tonight and took over two hours. My son's dinner was delivered and mine came 15 minutes later. The place is cramped and the beer is not cold. Service extremely  slow. I would not go back"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place close to my home and a good price, unfortunately pizza tastes old and crust was soggy only warm not hot at all. Definitely not the best pizza I've ever eaten the staff were nice the jobless wings were good could of used more garlic parm in them. We will not be eating from here again."}
{"text":"I just ordered delivery online from Caliente for the first time, and it was not a positive experience. Only half of our order was delivered, so we called the store to remedy the situation. Not only did they have the wrong address (an address I had never even heard), but they also acted as though it were somehow our fault that they forgot half of our order. The employee on the phone was not apologetic at all, but did say that the rest of our food would be delivered. I was not impressed with the quality of the food that we did receive; the French fries were extremely soggy, and it seemed as though the chicken tenders had been frozen previously. I was not impressed with the quality of the food or the customer service and would not order from Caliente again."}
{"text":"We have been to caliente's before and haven't been disappointed. We tried the pizza today, and the crust and sauce were really great! The pizza prices are a little high compared to others for the size we got, but with the crust being hand-made, it's worth the little bit extra. 

I had the buffalo chicken salad, and it was good. Nothing too fancy or messy about it, but it's not the best I've had. 

The shining star of our visit was the cheesy breadsticks and marinara. The price is great for the quantity and they were just delicious! This is our 3rd visit and we will definitively continue to come back."}
{"text":"Just left, with a very happy belly! The pizza is amazing! I was concerned that the crust would be dense, it was surprisingly light. The sauce tastes nice and fresh. Service was great. Nick I believe was our server. 
Can't wait to try more items!"}
{"text":"After all of the hype and recommendations this pizza was very disappointing. Cheese was plentiful but dull and flavorless. Seems like mostly mozzarella. Crust doughy and chewy. There are better pies in Allison Park."}
{"text":"Meh is about the most I can say about this place. I decided to try this location after a disastrous experience in Bloomfield. The bar is small and very dingy. Low end furniture and the usual abundance of crap advertising on the walls combine to give the place all the ambiance of an outhouse. The food looked decent coming out of the kitchen but I didn't bother to try any. The beer selection was OK but it wasn't well balanced and the beer list itself was crumpled and dingy just like the environs. My server was attentive but it seems that once you are assigned a server, nobody else will be bother to assist you. There is such a dearth of decent good beer places in the North Hills, but please, we don't need anymore Caliente's in the world. Also when your beer guy or your booze guy says, \"I've got this great poster.\" Just say no."}
{"text":"If you order sauage topping expect one piece per slice.   Pizza was good but please tell me I need to order extra topping.  I was by myself so a bar area would of been nice. Great idea craft drafts good pizza but don't think I will come back."}
{"text":"Pitiful don't waste your time. Pizza was not worth $18 crust was not good beers were over priced and not even a pint draft (only 6,5abv).  Couldn't get a playoff pens game on main TV that might have been 42 at best.   Get a pizza at Wal-Mart your better off."}
{"text":"Pizza was good and the beer was over priced for the little glasses we got. ($9 & $7 each for a few fluid ounces, maybe about a measuring cups worth)

It was busy and the service was pretty bad.  And not because it was busy.  They seemed to have enough staff.  I've had a lot worse but it was not up to par that is for sure.

To many screaming kids.  I wanted a good beer and pizza but got a headache.  On a Friday night as well.  I counted almost 1/3 of the tables had small children. (Talking 2 or 3 years old). Maybe that was bad luck on us but either way.  Not cool.  I would bring my kids there, at least. Or that young.  Most of the tables are not suited for small children.  They are high and have stools.

A little small and tight because it may have to many tables.

I really want to like this place but as a first impression.  They failed..."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre and the service is awful. I've had the pie a few times...the quality is progressively getting worse. The subs are no better. The employee's always sound like your putting them out and they have better things to do...the last time I called for a pick up  order,I had a coupon for a one topping pie for 10.99. I asked for Xtra cheese for my one topping.  But, the impatient boy on the phone informed me that cheese was a premium  topping and there would be a  $2 charge.....for cheese. ...I hung up and called Milano's.  I won't go back to Caliente's"}
{"text":"I got a deep dish style speciality pizza, which was garlic spread with cheese, pineapple and chicken. It had a great crust.; I would say on par with BJ's Brewhouse.  The pizza it's self was a bit one one-dimension; until I added BBQ sauce. That made it like a garlic BBQ chicken pizza and it was really good. My kids got fries and chicken tenders, which were also good, considering it's a pizza place. My favorite part was their speciality Epic aged Stout; left over from craft beer week. It was delicious! So the reason I gave it only three stars: The pizza I got was on the expensive side; which is good for the quality they clearly put in it, but at the end of the day, I was not overly impressed with the flavor. Until I added BBQ sauce. For a few dollars more, I feel BJ's stands out a bit more for me; even if it is a chain..."}
{"text":"Went there for a half Sausage and half pepperoni pizza and had the Arsenal cider on draft. Great atmosphere and waitress took good care of us. Large selection of bottled beers. We will be back for sure. The menu is extensive and there is more we want to try."}
{"text":"I've stopped ordering wings as they are horribly inconsistent. Pizza as solid, not sure about award winning but solid.  Fries are good, my kids like their bread sticks."}
{"text":"We have consistently ordered from Caliente approx 2 days a week ( I know lol, I don't cook!) everything was so good, but it seems that lately they may have changed their weekday cook during the week over the past few months. The food during the week is always awful, 90% of the time (even on weekends) something is wrong or not delivered. I've had wings delivered pink and uncooked as well as inconsistent food ingredients. My husband and I have complained and have given many chances for things to be fixed but it seems to fall on deaf ears. Is it too much to ask to get food delivered exactly how I order and pay for?! We may need to look for a new delivery place for our twice a week take out!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great pizza and wings.  The Blues Brothers wings are awesome. Lots of TVs and a great assortment of beer."}
{"text":"Caliente is a go to place for excellent pizza which is hard to find in the North Hills and nice selection of local and excellent micro beers.  Prices aren't the cheapest but they do have good happy hour beer prices!  They also deliver in Allison park, Hamlton, Gibsonia areas!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in the north hills but man i wish someone would do better because in comparison to other citys and even some locations in oakland or downtown... this place is just average. Prices keep going up and the staff isnt super friendly at times. I give them an ok... but wish their was better."}
{"text":"This place has great food and they have a huge selection of beers. You can mix and match 6 packs to go which is really cool. Our waitress Vicky gave us excellent service. My only complaint would be the uncomfortable chairs and wobbly tables. They get extremely busy around dinner time so I would suggest going on a off time or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"We had pizza there on Thursday. It was so good that we decided to go back the following Monday. That time we had the wings. Just as good as the pizza. They had a 50 cent wing special so we got a couple dozen in different flavors. Lots of dry rub and wet sauce choices for the wings. Buffalo dry rub was our favorite. We will definitely return"}
{"text":"Just called to place an order for a sub. This was my 1st order ever from this place. I was talking to
Dan and was going to pay with a card so I had to run outside to grab my wallet and after 20seconds of waiting he hung up. I called back to see why he hung up and his reply \"i have other things to do I'm to busy to wait for you\" So I'll talked my business elsewhere and hopefully management finds a new assistant manager that treats their customers with respect. Being a business owner myself I couldn't imagine hanging up on a customer that is going to get their wallet to pay me."}
{"text":"4 stars for the great service,beer choice and the patio. (Thanks Vicky A)Not a big fan of what I ordered, it was ok. (Wings and pepperoni rolls)  I am hoping to experience the pizza on my next visit."}
{"text":"First time customer ordered a gourmet pizza best ever all the ingredients where fresh unlike another local pizza place that used canned vegetables.   Absolutely the best I have had in along time."}
{"text":"Pretty decent pizza and wings here. I went here for a Pittsburgh Craft Beer Week event and was impressed with the draft beer selection and also beers you could put in a mix and match six pack and take with you. Pretty cool place."}
{"text":"This location is disappointing. The food is nothing like what is served at the Bloomfield location. The pizza seemed underdone every time we have ordered it. The crust was thinner and soggy. The cheese was hardly melted and the pepperoni wasn't curled up. 

The building is entirely too small and has no real bar. The staff here has issues with time management and attentiveness to customers."}
{"text":"Average food. The place is small and can feel cramped at times. The outdoor seating is nice and better to sit at than the inside. I recommend the pizza, and I'm not a huge fan of the wings."}
{"text":"Heard good things about the Hampton location. NOT. The seating is tables very close together. The hostess knew the obnoxious kids at the table beside us and decided to stand between tables with her butt over the table in our dining space while she played with her phone. I even moved my elbow and bumped her ass. She turned and looked at me and stayed there giggling at her little friends. Didn't even get as far as ordering. No food is worth dealing with that atmosphere. Will never return!"}
{"text":"The very small resturant also has an outside eating area. Its basically the old sports bar with few changes. Limited seating inside. Had the deep dish pizza with the \"award winning crust\".  It did not seem like anything special. The soda that I got had a strange taste and was warm. The cost of the extras on the deep dish were pricy. The service was excellent. I debated on the number of stars I should give on this review. I went middle of the road. Would I eat in this resturant again? Yes, but I would not have it on my list of places I soon want to visit again."}
