{"text":"The food was delicious, the staff were friendly, it's just that the portion size was tiny. I left hungry."}
{"text":"I felt inclined to write a review about Farmhouse almost as soon as I got home, because the whole experience was really THAT GOOD.  We  came in on Easter Sunday.  Last minute decision, party of 5. I was a bit skeptical, because the Yelp profile indicates that it is not good for kids, and we have a 3 yr old and a 9 month old.  Oh, and a vegan.   We called ahead and the person on the phone indicated they would save us a table, and that yes, they could easily accommodate a vegan.  We arrived at 6:15, so maybe later would not be good for kids, but for us, they had a high chair set up and were good to go, super friendly and not all cut eye like some places are when you bring in littles.  Service was amazing.   So friendly and very knowledgable.  I loved the whole atmosphere in there.  Unpretentious, homey, and, oh yeah, Beau's on tap.  Can't go wrong with that.     The food.   Some have complained about the prices for the portions, but honestly, I found them to be absolutely perfect.  High quality food, locally sourced food, and portions that you eat and feel perfect, not stuffed and disgusting.      So yeah.  Come here.  Because it's pretty great.  And local.  And friendly. And they give a crap.  And all of that matters."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Friday night and was pleasantly surprised with my delicious meal.  I was surprised and fascinated by the fact that they didn't have a menu: just a beef dish, a fish dish, a veg, and a burger. Works for me because I generally don't trust places with big menus, but the waiter was ultra knowledgeable and gave us a highly detailed description of all the dishes. I don't think I've ever listened so much at a restaurant before!  Hopefully they write more of the descriptions on the blackboard to save the waiters and clients a lot of work.  I ordered the burger and fries with a side salad.  Salad was perfectly dressed with a light and vinagrette.  Burger was simple with a chipotle sauce (they are serious locavores here) and they even gave me a homemade ketchup made with local ingredients.  Everything was delicious, and though the portion size seemed average I felt stuffed by the end as they use very heavy and high quality ingredients.   Not the cheapest place for a burger and fries but it is a foodie resto with better than average food.  If you're not a fan of food talk and locavore pretensions (like my husband) you might not enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Food good. Hip atmosphere. Bring your credit card.  Actually, bring all of them. Prices a little out of line.  Especially for anything liquid."}
{"text":"Long time customer - **VERY DISAPPOINTED**  Some places you can tell that its all about the Chef.  When this place opened they had a class A chef, your steak was something wondrous, something to look forward to and much more than a piece of meat.  After several months enjoying family life I managed to get myself out of the house, it was either Harbour Sixty for a Provimi Veal Chop or to the farmhouse tavern for a classic mouth watering Rib Eye and I chose the later.  To my surprise the Chef that I had so learnt to love was no longer there, apparently he moved to Geraldine and I will be sure to follow.  I ordered as usual a few drinks and the Rib Eye, medium rare, the way you are supposed to eat a succulent broiled piece of meat and waited for over half an hour.  When the dish arrived I as usual cut off a corner of the newly seared meat to enjoy that fatty first bite, but the cut was a little strange, the meat was sticking to my knife, a sign that the meat was under cooked and was more on the rare side.  Now to qualify myself I am a big steak connoisseur and I happen to be in the meat business so I know a good cut and have had my share of well cooked dishes to know what is and what is not.  When the dish returned from sending it back it was steaming, the kind of steam you see in a chef Ramsey show where he looks disappointed because he knows they microwaved the food to overcompensate for the initial bad judgement, however in my case the chef stuck it on some other menacing high heat mechanism in the kitchen.  The mashed potatoes where now overcooked but worse the meat was crisp which was actually very pleasing to my palette, but they misjudged because now all of the seasoning was burnt which gave the meat a bitter taste.  This was now a piece of meat, something that could have been dredged up in almost any of the mediocre kitchens that exists in this over run town of restaurants, it is unfortunate but mostly sad that this is the end of another good thing.  two stars because the absinthe drink was fantastic and because of all the good times that used to be.  Bye bye and farewell, sorry to see you go."}
{"text":"Overall Farmhouse Tavern had good food and interesting dishes for brunch but they lose stars due to service of one gentleman in particular. My friend had booked a table on the weekend for 8 people and when she arrived it had reduced to 5 people and a baby. This resulted in a less than courteous attitude from one of the gentlemen. He told her her \"this is very frustrating and you should have told me in advance\" but she didn't even know that some people were going to cancel until the last minute and she did tell him right away. The comments are one thing but then he proceeded to tell her that \"this is not usually our policy but we are going to wait for your entire party to arrive before we seat you\". I can understand if it is the policy but if it's not, why make the exception? Surely restaurants have had cancellations and adjustments to party size before? This being said, most of us were there except for one friend who is a new mom and thus she ran 30 minutes late. He kept us standing at the door. Other servers were very nice and offered us coffee / juice / beer to drink while we waited. Finally when we were seated, he gave us a table that had been empty all this time (i.e. there wasn't even a lineup). He just didn't want to let us sit.  For the food - the eggs benedicts the bacon used is extremely yummy. The Mother and Child Reunion (panko crusted poached duck eggs with duck prosciutto) was good but smaller on the portion size. So for food - I would say yummy but could be slightly larger portions (which says a lot for me as I am not a huge eater).  Finally we were sitting around afterwards chatting and there was again no lineup and the same man walked by and muttered just loudly for us to hear \"these girls are still here?\"  so overall for that reason I would not return again.  Otherwise I ate at the Saint the day before for brunch on Ossington and in comparison was great - great service - reasonably priced and yummy."}
{"text":"Don't love the location- not very accessible by TTC/ far from the downtown core- but I guess the junction is up and coming!  Had the hangover poutine- nothing like a normal poutine- served with shredded rabbit, which I found quite interesting . Everything you order here is very decadent and great quality- just need to be willing to venture across the city and to be adventurous with your food choices! I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Went as two couples, the burger and the steak were good and the lamb was not. We asked for desert and were told they were out. Kinda dingy and way overpriced, for that kind of money I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"After reading a spotlight on Farmhouse Tavern in Toronto Life, we were looking forward to heading there for brunch. Having had the experience, I can only say that it is grossly overpriced and overrated.   Normally I don't mind a chalkboard menu, but half the items have cute names with no description as to what they are. Let me tell you, please don't order the \"Hey, Buttercup!\", which I was told was squash on salad, with two eggs. This was actually half of an average squash, roasted, steaming hot and truly inedible, with a garnish of greens around the sides, and eggs. I get that brunch meals are often a rip-off, but don't charge $15 for something that clearly cost you less than $2 to make. With my $10 flute of mimosa, I am appalled that this bland, fleecing brunch cost over $25.  Brunch places can open receive this kind of hype, but avoid this place -- it's nothing more than a flash in the pan."}
{"text":"Went for Dinner for my wife's bday (New Years day). Fantastic food and we will return. Definite 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"Just a fantastic dining table experience. Food was amazing. That was a given. But the whole experience from the moment we walked in the door to when we stepped out was above par.   Many restaurants in Toronto make great food but every step along the way here was a pleasure. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation 2 weeks in advance for a Saturday night w/ another couple. Arrived to be seated near front door where we proceeded to be blown away by gusts of cold air that came in every time the door was opened. We asked to be reseated and were told all other tables were taken. Hostess made an attempt at first to keep the curtains in front of the door closed, but quickly lost interest. We wore our jackets all evening. Ordered a lot of food-Drinks, apps, several courses, dessert, coffee. We were told to leave at the 2.5 hour mark for another reservation. When we made the reservation, we were not informed that we'd be on the clock. Too many great dining options in TO to put up w/ treatment like this. Take your $ elsewhere, we will."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to this place in two years.  All the surprise factors are gone this time so I tend to pick on some faults this time.    Fault  #1:  We made a reservation for 5 people but we were seated at a table for 4 only!  The whole point for making reservation is to make sure you have seating for your party.  When I say \"seating\", it doesn't just mean a chair to sit on but also a table with enough room for the plates too.  I totalling understand for a small neighbourhood restaurant, it has to make good use of every seat during busy hours.  However. during our entire stay, there were an empty 2-people table next to our left and also an empty 6-people table to our right.  I did ask the waitress to let us have the 2-people table as well but was buffed off with an excuse.    When we left the restaurant, the 6-people and 2-people tables were left empty still.  If I ever go back with 5 people again, I would just tell them 6 instead.  So for customer service on this part, I gave them 2 out of 5. (Failed!)  Fault #2:  Two of us ordered duck and foie gras which were  served on a rustic wood plate.  I did enjoy the food but the old rustic look of the wood plate looks so dirty.  It makes me wonder if they ever properly clean it at all.  May be they should dump this wood plate and serve it on regular plates.  For this one, I gave them 3 out of 5. (Barely acceptable!)  Fault#3:  For hygiene reasons, we all should wash our hands before we eat.  The restrooms are located in the basement so one must be very careful walking down that steep stairs.  I don't know about the ladies' room but the men's room has strong foul smell.  It is because of the urinal is installed right next to the sink.  And the worse of all is the urinal does not have water connected to it.  This means it never got flushed.  Can't someone just simply pour a bucket of ice cubes inside once a little while,  or placing an air freshener in the room, or give out free nose plugs to the customers?   For this one, a big FAIL!!"}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch and was very happy with my choice. Food was delicious, service was quick and was overall very impressed with the friendly atmosphere. It can be busy, so make sure to get a reservation a couple hours in advance. Especially on Sunday's. We sat at a counter with a direct view of the kitchen and felt quite entertained watching the staff work. Will without question be going back to try more of their interesting menu.   I have to add, the food coming out of the kitchen looked drool worthy. I was mesmerized."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say that we will never return.  We once boasted about the quality of food at farmhouse to all of or friends, but we can no longer overlook the extremely rude staff.  From the moment you walk in you get a sense for the less than friendly vibe of the place, the host is incredibly unwelcoming. I can get over a \"cold vibe\" for good food, BUT I absolutely cannot overlook being practically scolded or meant to feel like an annoyance from the server.  This is the second time that we have encountered this same server, and have had the same hostile attitude both times.  What's worse, is that they will openly talk about you amongst themselves and then shoot you evil eye from across the room.    If you choose to dine here, let me give you some advice - make up your mind on what you want to eat quickly, don't ask questions, order alcohol to ring up your tab, and be totally cool with feeling like you are being done a huge favour by dining here.   This is toronto, the word will get around and truthfully, the quality of food is not like it was a couple of years ago."}
{"text":"We tried the Farmhouse Tavern for brunch. The decor is adorable: Ontario farm chic.   The main event was the egg sandwich -- the bread was charred with flavour; the porkbelly, a perfect texture; the sauce, succulent; the salad, dressed with taste. Their watermelon purée won hearts.   Even though the service and food were inconsistent overall, it was a lovely and charming time."}
{"text":"Arrived for an 815 reservation on a Saturday night to find much of the small menu already sold out. This place seems to care very little about the comfort of its customers.  There was only one small coat rack (with 3 or 4 hooks) for a room that seats about 30. In addition, the menu was written on a single blackboard which was of no use if you were sitting against the wall.  The waiter suggested that we take a picture of the menu and read it off our phone. Apparently, it was too much effort for the restaurant to write it down on a piece of paper and photocopy.  As for the food, some of it was reasonably good - the ploughman's lunch had a few interesting items (although there was an inedible piece of porkbelly included), but the mains we tried (the fish and  the porkbelly bowl) were no better than what an average home cook would make with ingredients from loblaws.   No dessert was offered. The single item on the menu that night, a chocolate mousse, was sold out as well.  The server suggested that we have a cheese plate \"for desert\".  I've been to plenty of \"farm to table\" restaurants in various cities.  The good ones remember that they are still part of the hospitality industry and treat their customers accordingly. This isn't one of them."}
{"text":"..Consistent with the restaurants' local theme, all of the beverage offerings are sourced from Ontario.  This is totally fine by me (I am a huge supporter of local wineries), but for some palates, the Niagara region might not cut it. For those less enthused by local wine or brews, cocktails are the way to go. The menu was tiny with only three \"house\" cocktails described to us, but the bar could accommodate requests.  Over the night we had a few classic Old Fashions, an \"Apple Spritz\", the \"Maple Sour\", a glass of Ontario Merlot and a full round of Ice wine.  The apple spritz was light, but not overly sweet and the old Fashions were prepared simply and to my dining companions' taste.  The maple sour was delicious and way too easy to drink- it had a nice balance of sweet, sour, and almost creamy consistency from the frothy egg white on top.  I can't honestly say I detected any maple, but the drink was balanced and satisfying nonetheless.    Our only issue was with the glass of Shiraz my girlfriend originally received, which had an obvious acidic, off- aroma.  Our server very professionally replaced it for a Merlot, which was much more palatable. Like the cocktails, the food offerings were limited and were displayed on a large chalkboard on the wall marked up as dishes sold out.  With so few dishes to choose from in the first place, I do tend to get annoyed with dishes selling out when reservations are set ahead of time and the chef knows how many heads in the house.  To be honest, I don't know the best way for restauranteurs to deal with this without being wasteful, but it's just something to consider for diners who may be already limited by their palate or dietary needs.  With dishes not really assigned to a specific meal course, and portions varying across the board, I'm not sure if I love or hate the way the menu is arranged.  It certainly allows for more meal-time flexibility based on hunger and company, but it really makes ordering difficult.  There were only a handful of menu items, and yet we still bantered back and forth about who would order what, and if we wanted to all get in on a larger item to split.  Over the evening we tried:  Ploughman's Platter A lovely selection of buttery toast, duck confit, thick bacon, soft-boiled egg, pate, rillettes, cheese, mustard, preserves and pickles.  Both the confit and bacon was crispy and decadent, despite being served cold.  The pate was smooth, sweet and buttery, and the pickles were briny and bright.  My only criticism would be that it definitely needed more toast, and while the the chunks we received looked and tasted fantastic, the wedge shape is really not appropriate for eating with pate, cheese or rillettes- it's an egg yolk or preserve sopper-upper, and that's about it...."}
{"text":"Had a great meal there once and had been looking forward to going again. Today we tried to stop by and see if we could get seating for 3 for brunch. We didn't have reservations and we were prepared to wait. The host didn't have the common courtesy to say \"hello\", \"good morning\" or offer any of the usual greetings...okay, so everyone can have a bad day. But when we asked if it was possible to be seated without a reservation, this host was rude and dismissive. He never made eye contact or smiled, instead mumbling about making reservations next time and maybe trying something down the street as he waved us off. There was nobody waiting behind us, so taking 30 seconds to politely tell us they couldn't take us, wouldn't have been too taxing. Dinning out is as much about the staff and atmosphere as it is about the food. As we left, we all felt humiliated and wondered what had just happened and why. Because of this individual, I cannot recommend this restaurant and will never be back."}
{"text":"This was our first time here after making a reservation for brunch.  While the food was okay, the service was awful.  We were waiting at least 15 minutes after being seated for somebody to provide us with water and ask if we wanted drinks which then took forever to get to us.  I could see them on the bar and was tempted to go up and grab them myself. We should have taken this as a sign of things to come. We kind of felt like we were ignored throughout even though we were right in the server's pathway by the bar.   It was a frustrating experience and one that I don't wish to repeat especially when paying $100.00 approx. for brunch. I appreciate that it was busy but towards the end when we were waiting for somebody to ask for the bill, it was pretty dead at this stage. There are much better brunch places out there where they are glad of your custom."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for dinner for the first time. Food was really good. The server we had was the worst.  We tried to flag someone down on numerous occasions, he was bordeline rude. The hostess and the bartender were ok but I will never go back nor recommend it.    Had the burgers and bone in pie.  Dessert was also very tasty.  The sauce on the bread pudding is like liquid crack.  Last word. If you are going to ignore your table and provide bad service don't stand by the bar on your phone while you are doing it."}
{"text":"I took my parents here for Mother's Day and it received the Parental Stamp of Approval, since they said we should come here again sometime! I would give this place 4.5 stars.  My dad and I both had the burger, which I'm going to make a bold statement and say, is the best burger I've had in Toronto.  The sauce that comes on it is zippy and delish.  It also has goats cheese, which is always a key ingredient I look for on a menu.  My mom had the eggs benny.  I wasn't sure if she heard the server mention the eggs are from a duck and not a chicken, but I hoped she would not be scared off.  Luckily she wasn't and she also loved her meal.   The only thing I found annoying about this place was the menu.  It's written on a chalkboard, so you might have to crane your neck or do a 180 to see it,  and until you ask the server what the cryptically named items are (Mother and Child Reunion, Cover Girl), they remain a mystery.  As it was a busy afternoon there on Mother's Day, we heard the server cheerfully explain to every single table what the items were!    Though it's a wee bit on the pricey side,  (I don't think there was a glass of wine under $10), it's definitely worth hauling to the Junction for.  They also have Sunday night specials since they're closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner.  I had never been here before and the server neglected to mention that there were no menus. She had to explain each item on the menu (of which she did a poor job) and I ended up with a soupy fish dish that was not at all what I was expecting and not very good. My friends both got the burger ($20) and it was ok, but not worth 20 bucks. The fries tasted frozen.   I get the whole farmhouse/menu written on a board thing - BUT if you are going to expect your servers to explain each dish from memory then you had better train them to be top notch, because mine wasn't very good at it and I ended up paying for food I that wasn't very good.   Very disappointing considering all the great reviews."}
{"text":"The Mother and Child reunion is delicious.  I added the fras grais as well. Memosa on the side.  Perfect Saturday brunch"}
{"text":"Our party was really not impressed by the taste of the food. It is not bad, but for the price, it falls short of the expectations and the portions aren't too filling. The service is very friendly, the terrace is very nice and has sunlight.  The table next to us ordered a fried duck. The duck was fried entirely, with the head still on, and then arranged on a platter in a frozen pose as if it was going to take wing. The couple who ordered it felt quite uneasy about ordering this monstrosity. They had no idea how to eat it. Rip the head off? Rip the wings off?   Meanwhile, I was eating my vegetarian pasta."}
{"text":"A wonderful new addition to the Junction Triangle's Dupont stretch. Very rustic in look and feel with mismatched furniture and a true farmhouse atmosphere. The kitchen is open, located in the back of the restaurant. We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the hustle and flow of the restaurant.   We started with a variation on vichyssoise which was presented beautifully and had some surprisingly complex flavours going on. This was followed by raw oysters from  Colville Bay (PEI) served with a house made mignonette, presented with freshly grated horseradish - classic.  For our mains we had the Steak Frites, cooked to a perfect medium rare, offered up simply with shoestring fries, and a burger, pink in the middle, with a dollop of house-made sauce similar to a Thousand Island dressing but more complex in flavour.  On tap was a couple of types of Beau's beer - Lug Tread and Festivale. We had the Lug tread to start which was very cold and appreciated on a hot evening (no air conditioning as of yet). With our meal we had wine from Niagara (can't remember the name) which was quite good. The wine offerings are all Canadian, primarily from the Niagara region.  All in all a great meal with attentive, friendly service from our bartender Anna and others on staff, including owner Darcy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We went for brunch one dreary Saturday. We really enjoyed this top notch establishment. One order of Mother and Child and one burger with a side of foie gras was more than enough. Quality and service were outstanding. Worth a visit to The Junction. Reservations are a must!"}
{"text":"Had a great first experience here. Ordered the fried Swiss chard eggs Benny. Eggs were perfectly poached. Hollandase sauce homemade and had a unique rich flavour. Paired perfectly with one of their famous caesars, which had an oyster on top!  Food was delicious. I savored every bite. Staff was also very friendly and easy going. Good didn't take too long to come out too despite how busy they were. Would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had another trip to Farmhouse Tavern.   Service: Again it is really slow to the point where you will be waiting average 30 mins for your food from the time you order. As much as the food is good, 30 mins is a long time. For that I have to bump it down plus other little things.  Will come back for half price..."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch one saturday. We had made a reservation, but from the looks of it, it was not necessary that day. The food was decently tasty but way to expensive. For that reason alone we probably won't be going back. The food is good but not different or more tasty than a number of other similar restaurants around the city. We ordered the following items:  - Burger Pretty tasty burger. On par with other top-class burgers I've had around the city  - Eggs benny Again fairly tasty.  - Banana bread This was a special that day. It was just ok. Especially for the price. It was $12-14 for a large slice of banana bread topped with whipped cream and a berry compote. Maybe at $6 this would be a great deal. But at double the price and having made banana bread before, it was not worth it"}
{"text":"came here because it was in my area and i heard about it on some tv show. everything was great!"}
{"text":"Sorry but, their best days are behind them I think. Food used to be great but, we were here recently and were pretty disappointed, $21 for the burger they're serving is obscene. I think Daniel Bolud's is $25 and would put this mess to shame; bland, small, tasteless and \"phoned in\". They serve only Ontario wines which is fine but, honestly, not sure why a restaurant would chose to die on this hill, I've yet to have a wine from ON that was worth $15 a glass but, regardless, if you're going to serve only ON reds, at least serve them cooler than the 75+ degrees I received. Service was indifferent, tables were wonky (we were seated at the entrance to the kitchen even though we had a reservation and there were better tables empty during our whole meal) and the server never even bothered to drop waters on the table or ask if we'd like some. The menu is on a chalkboard on the side of the room and between the small illegible handwriting and the dark room, it's unreadable. Too few choices would lead one to believe that the server would at least explain the menu in detail but no, we had to drag it out of her like we were puling wisdom teeth without anesthetic, painful and unnecessary. Thanks but, there's much better restaurants in Toronto, in fact, theres better places within 3km of here for the same or less money. Not sure what happened but, feels like the ownership has either given up or is focused elsewhere. Disappointing and underwhelming."}
{"text":"Keep coming back for the brunch menu. Always fresh and always super delicious. Big fan of the Eggs Benny combinations s/ meat or fish as well as the burgers. The crew is very friendly and informative about the menu."}
{"text":"Never again.   You know when you go out for dinner and the food is so good you don't even think about the money you spent? That will not happen here. You will remember every dollar and go home hungry and wondering if you have enough change in your pocket for a slice of pizza. This meal was a pain.  I was biking past this place and saw it had space on the patio on a weekend, which seemed too good to be true and maybe it was. The service was arrogant and unfathomably slow. The drinks were outrageously expensive as was the food - for what was served. I have no problem paying for deliciousness. For $22 I would hope to get more than 2 cold ravioli - not even a tiny side. I was starving after I finished. I think it should be pointed out that I don't actually eat that much and this is the first time I've ever complained about portion size.  I kept pining for Terroni as I inhaled the two little cold pockets on my plate. Washed it down with my $12 cocktail...boyfriend ordered a burger and didn't eat the bun as it was untoasted and slightly stale. Details people. We were there for over 2 hours and that was mainly because our waiter seemed to have no interest in coming to take our order or check on us."}
{"text":"Average brunch nothing special , served by a waitress with major attitude.  matter of fact she scolded us for asking a question twice and had a fit in the open kitchen area telling the other staff about us . Service was hectic , no one seems to be happy to work there , it was a stressful environment we were reluctant to ask for anything ."}
{"text":"What an absolute delight!  I've never thought much about eating local - it never really affected my food decisions.  My opinion has definitely changed now.  You can taste the difference.  The best part about Farmhouse Tavern is that they focus their menu based on what is in season, so you get delicious and inspired cooking.  I ordered the lamb dish and the trout ceviche.  The trout was so bright and delicious and the serving was extremely generous.  I could have eaten that all night.  The lamb was so moist, it melted as I ate it.  I can't wait until my next visit.  Bonus points are given because the chef so kindly accommodated my vegetarian and vegan friends with off menu items.  Thank you for making a memorable night for me and all my friends."}
{"text":"The lamb is divine! That's all I have to say. Oh and the burger is also very delicious. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Driving down to High Park to check out the cherry blossoms on a beautiful spring day, we decided to stop somewhere close by with a patio and drink a cold one.  This restaurant came up in our search on Yelp so we stopped in.  We arrived at 3 pm on a Sunday afternoon, which unbeknownst to us is closing time.  They let us know that we could come in but we would need to order quickly from the kitchen as they were closing down.  We didn't realize that it was only a brunch menu, but two of us ordered quickly while the other two did not want to be rushed and just ordered drinks.  The menu for the patio was on a chalkboard on the wall, and so you didn't have an opportunity to really read through the options and see what you were ordering.  My friend ordered bread pudding, and I ordered the farm burger.  When our food arrived, her bread pudding looked like french toast and she said it was delicious.  My burger arrived with an amazing colourful salad and a giant egg sliding on and off the burger.  The food was really good, and the staff were very nice.  All of the food is locally sourced, and specifically from Ontario which I can appreciate.  The prices are a bit on the higher end, ($20 for a burger) but it was good food.  I didn't like that you couldn't read a menu in advance, and it was confusing that they were shutting down for 2 hours (between 3:00 - 5:00) to prep for the dinner crowd.  Apparently they have a sister restaurant down the street that would be open during 3 - 5, so I'm not sure why they didn't send us there.  By the time we arrived as well, quite a few things were crossed out on the brunch menu as they had run out, so I guess Sundays are a busy time for them.  I would recommend, but I don't know if I would return, unless I was in the area again."}
{"text":"Dinner experience. Good service, interesting decor, good casual local farm to table food. Cocktail good but  wine choice was so so,  priced high. Not the best ploughman platter but decent. Fish main, large in portion, fish cooked well but over seasoned in places. Pork belly came with way too much fat. It was literally like eating a bowl of just fat. Again large in portion. Overall, taste was decent but overpriced for the experience."}
{"text":"After waking up at 5am to watch Team Canada beat Team Sweden in the 2014 Winter Olympics, my friends and I were hungry for some REAL food.   We hiked out to the Junction (yes, it is NOT an easy place to get to, but worth it) and stopped into this cute little restaurant on Dupont. We were greeted immediately, and seated at what I would call the best seat in the house. We basically got to watch the kitchen do everything. I took off my coat and no sooner had I put it on the back of my chair, the owner came over and put a huge piping hot cup of coffee in front of me and said, \"This is on the house cause of the Jersey\" (I was sporting my Team Canada Gear)  I ordered a shot of bourbon for it, and they gave me quite a large amount for 8 dollars.   I don't mind not really knowing what the menu was. I had some ideas, (Obviously the burger is a burger) but the waitress was more than happy to tell us EVERYTHING.   I went for the burger (and although it was 20$, it was worth it). By far, the best burger I've ever had. The chef offered me blue cheese instead of Goat since he had some leftover. He also handed me a new bar towel because he knew one napkin wasn't going to be enough.   My friend got the \"hey buttercup\" which was soooooo good. I'm not usually one for Squash, but this dish was just delicious for being without meat. (Gotta have egg though)  We both had DELICIOUS Caesars and paid our bill. On our way out the owner had set up some ball hockey nets and sticks outside, so we hung out with him and played some street hockey for a bit, and left with one of the BEST eating experiences I've ever had in Toronto.   You pay for what you get at this place. No hiding that. But man, it was worth it. I felt AMAZING after that."}
{"text":"I met friends here for late afternoon cocktails on the patio. Because the side patio is a nice little sunny spot and the cocktails were terrific, I'm giving more than the 1-star rating that our experience deserved. We should've stopped at drinks.   I had dinner with my partner here about a year ago and vaguely remembered leaving feeling cheated. Now I remember why. The whole experience is just so painfully contrived. This is the sort of place that will put a soft boiled egg or pork belly on ANYTHING and then charge you through the nose. $12 cocktails come in deliberately mismatched glasses that look like they were collected from Value Village. The decor is similarly farmhouse ironic complete with wildly uncomfortable tractor seats. And we've all seen servers like this before: attractive, but with a perfunctory, could-care-less attitude that make you feel like you're merely being tolerated.   But the food was the real issue. We ordered the $24 Ploughman's Platter to snack on with our drinks. What arrived at our table was ridiculous. Our server proudly rattled off a description of the locally-sourced mishmash of items that absolutely didn't work together and looked like they'd been plated by a blind person. Chicken bones with some random little bits of flesh attached. A stuffed, deep fried jalapeño pepper. A couple tiny bites of cheese. Haphazard smears of mustard. Some over-pickled vegetables. A teaspoon of some shredded meat. A beet juice soaked egg. And two stingy chunks of bread for the three of us to divvy up. It honestly looked like chef had dumped the compost bin onto a greasy board. (I'll attempt to post a photo.)  The summer salad was similarly random. Chunks of cooked beets along with wide shreds of shouldn't-be-raw, vinegar-y carrot (parsnip?) and a cute clump of shoots of something. But the kicker was what was hiding underneath. The hairy, inedible scrap end of a beet. It looked like the tail end of a rat and was utterly repulsive. We asked our server to take it away and, predictably, she feigned confusion, unapologetically informing us that the chef puts it in every salad. Of course, silly us.  If you're thirsty for a tasty and original cocktail in the sunshine, by all means check out Farmhouse. But I'd strongly suggest you take your appetite elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night this past long weekend.  Sat on the patio, I think because it was a long weekend, it wasn't too busy.  Ordered one of their cocktails (I can't remember the name - the one with the watermelon in it) and it was delish.  Also had a Caesar later which was pretty good and came with a smoked oyster.  Like many other restaurants in Toronto, this one proudly serves food made from local ingredients (local produce & meat), which is always nice.  I had the burger and fries, and my friend had 1/2 dozen oysters and the mushroom gnochi - all were very good.  Service was excellent, will def come back."}
{"text":"Meal: Eggs in a nest - a chef who can make me want more roasted squash with poached eggs deserves 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is one of our favourite places in the city, our 'go-to' restaurant for a consistently great night out.  Try the burger, then go back and try everything else. The charcuterie board is another standout. And, a great selection of beers and wines. You want to go to here."}
{"text":"I'm not one to go back to a restaurant for the same dish over and over again, but the Vegetable Harvest Platter here is to die for. The staff is also very friendly and personable - attentive, but not smothering in the slightest. It's a small, intimate, dimly lit space which is nice for a date spot, however it can get relatively loud. If you go on a Saturday night like I did, I highly recommend making a reservation beforehand, as the tables get filled very quickly. Location isn't the greatest, but it could be worse."}
{"text":"I don't usually post reviews (as you can tell) but this experience was so awful that I felt compelled to have to share my story so that you may avoid falling into this trap of an establishment at all costs.  Upon arriving we were greeted and seated fairly quickly - we somehow avoided any Sunday brunch rush (red flag possibly?). Drinks and coffee were served hastily but we were told that they had ran out of any juice... Oh well.   Moving forward, two of us wanted to order their \"signature dish\" we had come for: the Mother & Child Reunion. But unfortunately that too was sold out. I guess it must have been really busy before our arrival... Unfortunate, but it happens, so we decided to order the Barn Yard Burger instead. Once we placed our food orders everything just went downhill from there.  While our server was on top of us up until this point, once he took our orders he disappeared, nowhere to be seen again. It was rather perplexing because the patio was half empty as was the rest of the restaurant. After a 40 minute wait for our food and no attention from any of the other servers that were occasionally passing by, I went to the kitchen to figure out where our food and server had gone. Alas, I found our server polishing cutlery and chatting with a fellow server in the back. Upon asking whether our food would be ready soon, he had the audacity to tell me the restaurant was \"busy\", that they had a rush of 15 tables seated at once, and that the kitchen staff was working hard. As a server in the industry, I know most of the lines in the book, but I would never be able to say that to a customer with a straight face when it was so clear that this was not at all the case. No matter, I wasn't looking to argue with him and god forbid interfere with his polishing duties (in the middle of service). With absolutely no apologies made or attempt at easing our clear frustration and discontent we waited another 10 minutes before we were graced by his presence again, this time carrying our food.   Onto the food. While I sincerely appreciate locally raised organic food, for a $20 burger we were all expecting a patty larger than the size of ping pong ball. More importantly, with beef of such supposed quality I was expecting it to be cooked slightly less than well done. Even medium would've significantly improved its taste. The bacon was an even greater travesty and over cooked to the point that it was like trying to chew through an old leather shoe. I mean if I was willing to pay the premium for local organic meat, why on earth would you overcook both cuts? Furthermore, there was so little cheese added that I could honestly not even tell it was there. The duck egg that was served on the side was cooked in so much hot oil that I had to cut off half the egg off to discard the horrible plasticky crisp that surrounded it.   There was absolutely nothing about that burger that justified its $20 price. Feeling completely robbed, we asked for our bill to try and forget the entire disaster of an experience as quickly as possible. Despite being a worker in the industry, I simply could not justify adding any more than 5% gratuity to my portion of my bill and neither could my friends. Upon this realization, our server once again had the audacity to let us know that we had not tipped... Not asking what went wrong or apologizing for the long food wait or proposing something to ease our frustration (comping the $3.50 drip coffee refill maybe?) but simply stating the fact and displeasure. Finding no possible words to retort, we simply got up and left our disgruntled waiter.   This was by far my worst restaurant experience in Toronto and I implore all of you to avoid this establishment. Unless of course you enjoy over-cooked, over-priced food and completely abysmal service."}
{"text":"Abusive, careless staff.  our reserved table was 2 meters!! away from their smoking grill. They started smoking meat which produced very heavy thick smoke and we were pretty much left there to choke. The staff I guess feels that smoking meat right next to the customers is good atmosphere.. It's been an hour since we left and I still feel the pressure in my lungs.  All of our clothes and bodies smell like campfire.  The service was really bad as well. It took 2 hours until we received our main dishes. We set for 3 hours in total, and they didn't even come a single time to refill our water.  The portion size compare to the price are very tiny. we shared starters and a main entree, and I left very hungry. The food is very mediocre.  To me the worst abusive part was smoking meat 2 meters away from our table for hours without considering the extreme health risk it creates to the customers. I'm a healthy guy and my lungs still hurt."}
{"text":"Amazing! Amazing ambiance, amazing food, amazing service. Great place for a date, or an intimate night with friends. Food is great and nothing like you'll find anywhere else! Smoked rabbit what!??"}
{"text":"Always very impressed by the food here! Our group shared a number of appetizers while I had the braised lamb. They were all absolutely delicious! If planning for any special occasion, call in advance for their big items. Won't be disappointed!   Their menu changes now and again so it's a great place to check out once a while. For lunch, they have lots of great burgers."}
{"text":"It was simply delicious! We shared the Eggs  Benedict with kale and gravilax (rainbow trout) and \"Mother and child\" (duck leg) with foie gras. The service was excellent - the server took the the time to explain the menu and make recommendations to make our first visit really enjoyable."}
{"text":"Really fun place to enjoy an evening of good wine and food with friends. The barnyard burger was excellent. Great wine list."}
{"text":"I phoned to make reservations. The outgoing message said to book online or text to make reservations. Because I thought it easier at the time, I texted all details for a reservation (2 people, date and time).  Fairly quickly, I received a response: \"Ok. Thanks.\" I hesitated for a moment, then replied: \"Is this the confirmation?\" I didn't receive a reply, which I figured was because the answer was obvious. But I kept the text, just in case there was any confusion. Two weeks later we showed up and there was no reservation and the place was packed. I showed them the text and they explained that: 'It happens. They get so many texts.' What? They did find us one table and our service and meal were fine. It was incredibly noisy so we had to shout most of our conversation. Patrons are crammed in so noise is to be expected, I suppose. But it really make conversation difficult. However, the food was good."}
{"text":"I tried it 3 times for dinner because people love it so much but I still don't get it. The food is not creative, the prices are incredibly high, the menu extremely limited and the service way too hipster. The produces are fresh but is it not the least you can expect with those prices? I did go for brunch at their new location, the Farmer's Daughter Eatery. It was delicious and felt a lot less pretentious. Both locations have amazing patios and it's sometimes a good enough reason to pick a restaurant."}
{"text":"Always great food. They serve up the basics  done perfectly: burger, seasonal salads, steak, venison etc. Also great for brunch. Try the hollandaise or pancakes. Can't get enough of this place in the Junction. The produce is locally sourced and perfectly made!"}
{"text":"Had brunch reservations for 2 on Sunday with my partner around 1pm - that late in the day, not so sure you even need them.  Man at the door was not the friendliest but he got us sat with waters without any fuss.   Menu is small - which usually means everything is good. I got the spring fling which was AMAZING and my partner got the burger - absolutely delicious. We also got a side of bacon - don't miss this. Its thick cut and lightly smoked - best I've ever had.  Our service was excellent, thanks Erica!  If brunch was this good, I can't wait to come back for dinner.  We didn't have any wine or cocktails, but the wine list looks excellent."}
{"text":"Delightful food experience, hearty portions, eclectic & energetic atmosphere, artistic and unique setting, charming and friendly service  - can't wait to return with more friends for dinner ! Thanks for a great brunch.  Unassuming yet a winner!!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch. The eggs benedict was incredible (the hollandaise is made with brown butter). Might want to make reservations if you go as space seems pretty limited. Wish I lived on the west end- I would eat there all the time."}
{"text":"I think I owe this place a review.   Came here last summer after coworker's recommendation. I travelled all the way from downtown to find this place in the middle of nowhere. Yet it was probably one of the best meals I've ever had.   Honestly I don't remember everything I had anymore. I do remember the drinks were nice and refreshing for a summer day. The decor was rusty but unique and nice. Staff was helpful and friendly.   We had the ploughman's platter + fois gras to start (shared between two). It was a HUGEEEE serving of meat appetizer, with awesome cured carrots and homemade mustard and jam. I believe it had pork, beef, and duck confit. Everything on there tasted amazing and I probably gained 3 lbs from it.   My friend got the steak that night, it was good, but nothing too memorable.   I had the Fishdish, and let me tell you, I was BLOWN AWAY. It was THE BEST fish dish I've ever had. There were some eggplant puree and cauliflower with the fish. I have no idea how they did it but it was not greesy, refreshing, tastes amazing yet so simple. I think I was in food heaven after my first bite. I would come back here just to have this over and over again.   I would love to come back to try their brunch and their cote de boeuf one day.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Had a great brunch here (the burger everyone is probably ranting and raving about), albeit a little pricey. Came back for dinner and was met with enough rudeness from the host we just left our table and went elsewhere.   Basically, we sat down at a table that had uncomfortable tractor seats for stools so asked to move to the other table which we were offered. The host was like \"um, well I asked you where you wanted to sit and you chose that one, so no\". And he said it like we're both fucking idiots or something. So we grabbed our coats and went over to the Junction Eatery. It was unpretentious and delicious.   Top 10 New Restaurants of 2013 according to Toronto Life.... FOR ME TO POOP ON. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good service and quality all around. Its a bit pricy. I tried their duck dish and it was really tasty."}
{"text":"The Tavern is in a land far far away.It took us about 1 hr to get here from union station on the TTC. The room is eclectically decorated with animal bones, ropes and vintage trinkets. We were seated in the back room close to the kitchen. Here you can see the chefs in action ( eye candy) as the kitchen is open concept. The menu is written on the chalkboard walls. We had to get up from our seats and crowd our poor neighbours in order to read it. I had the eggs Benny and a Caesar. my companions both order the burgers. My eggs Benny were cooked perfectly, the hollandaise  was spot on but the bacon and muffin bread were over cooked and dry. I did really like the salad that it came with. If anyone knows what dressing they use please let me know :) The Caesar was nicely garnished with and olive and clam. The drink was spicy and smokey. The  burgers have a fried egg in them. Messy alert! And come with your choice of salad or fries.  The servers were friendly and came to the table often to refill out drinks.  The price points were a little higher than I expected.   I would probably come back some day for dinner."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Farmhouse Tavern Cuisine: Canadian Location: Junction Triangle Address: 1627 Dupont St Price Range: $15~25  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3  Service: 4  Ambiance: 5 Overall: 3.5   Extra information:  * Free Wifi * Happy hour and Open late  I would have never heard of this place because of the location (so far from my house) unless my friend wanted to try it out. I've never been to the Junction area before, so it was interesting to see what it was all about. There is no parking lot for the customers, so you need to find street parking in the residential area.  The restaurant name describes itself in terms of atmosphere and the interior design. It's super laid back with wooden tables and little patio on the side decorated with potted plants. Even before I walked in, I fell in love with this place! I love restaurants with distinct theme and character.  My friend and I sat by the beautiful bar right beside the window where I could see the open kitchen.  Ordered: Blueberry Julep  * Callingwood whisky, sortilege, blueberries and mint for $9 * My friend ordered this and I took a sip  * This is super strong! Don't think it's a sweet cocktail just because it has blueberries in it * If you are looking for a sweet cocktail, this is not for you  Ordered: Ploughman's Platter 5/5  * House made bread, pork belly, pickled duck eggs, grape jelly, smoked oyster and cheese for $22 * I had no idea what Ploughman's Platte would be like but so glad I ordered it * It came with 2 different types of cheese (can't remember the name) and it was so good * Pork belly was cooked perfectly and quite fatty (perfect with bread) * Cooked cabbage on the bottom soaking up all the pork belly fat * It was my first time trying pickled duck eggs  * Smoked oysters had a lot of flavor * I enjoyed everything on this dish, it's a must order!  Ordered: Farmhouse Burger 2/5  * Burger and fries for $15 * This was recommended by someone online when I read up on this restaurant  * I was excited to try this burger since it was suppose to be topped off with their house made Big Mac sauce! * Patty is completely covered in their house made sauce (taste like thick big mac sauce) * This burger was very disappointing * The patty was cooked way over done and it was dry even with the sauce * It was so dry to a point that I couldn't even finish it  * Fries were crispy but a little too salty * I would not order this again  Ordered: Fish Dish 2/5  * 2 pieces of fish with vegetables served with house made bread for $23 * My friend ordered this dish because she loves fish * Fish was cooked well but overall it was very bland  My dining experience at Farmhouse Tavern started off great but ended on a disappointing note. The atmosphere and service of the restaurant was just so awesome and the food started off great with the Ploughman's Platter but the main dishes just failed to impress me. I would go back for the Ploughman's Platter alone if I was in the area but am not sure if I want to try any other main dishes."}
{"text":"Let me describe my last experience at this place. I went here with my friends who were visiting from out of town. They seated us on the patio next to the smoker. We choked on smoke. The waiter seemed off kilter somehow, as if he was high. His smile was a little scary, as was the way he'd sidle up to us from behind the bushes, literally standing on the sidewalk. They moved us indoors when we complained about the smoker, where my friends complained of the sweltering heat (no air conditioning).   The experience was rather comical really. My friends were wondering why in the world I would have taken them to this joint. Then they served us the food. You could see the look in their eyes. The delight. The surprise. The food is good. Shockingly good.  As noted, this place has its own smoker, which they use to smoke all their own bacon in-house. They excel in charcuterie fare, along with meats, from roast chicken to steak to braised cheeks and foie gras. Flavour abounds. All is home made and the chef plainly cares about his food. The menu does change, so what you get does vary from time to time.  It's all just fantastic, down to earth food. The menu isn't large, but what they do they do amazingly well. Just try not to sit next to the smoker."}
{"text":"Put on a plaid shirt and head on down to the Farmhouse Tavern for some grub.  We didn't want to wait in line at Rose and Son's and I made a reservation here for brunch. That's right, a reservation!.  I love the tavern decor.  Kitschy, rustic, eclectic.  Before I ordered I noticed the wine list on the wall.  They had some great Niagara region wines available.   Our service was great and I engaged in some burger banter with our waiter.  He really stood behind the Farmhouse burger as being one of the best burgers in the city!  One of us had to order it!  My friend ordered the popular burger topped with a fried duck egg. It was smaller than expected... that or I like a challenge (I didn't even order it, so I'm all talk right now).  But she said it was filling and delicious.  I still have to try it!  I ordered their Eggs Benny with bacon, potatoes, and greens. Okay, I REALLY liked the buttery crispy and soft biscuit. One of the best biscuits I've had served with a Benny.  Overall, simple food executed well with fresh local ingredients.  We had a  great brunch here and I will have to return for dinner!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We went for brunch today, we were more than 15 min late for our reservation (Ya, they take brunch reservations! Awesome!), but the staff were super accommodating and friendly and we were seated almost right away. The Caesars are unbelievable- they use tequila (generous amounts), splash some ginger and siracha, and it's topped with a smoked oyster. Amazing. Everyone at the table did the eggs benny- I had kale and grav lax on mine (trout, which was a nice change from salmon and worked well with the flavours on the plate), hubby had bacon. The kale was perfect, the lax was slightly undercured and could have used a bit more love (too much salt, not enough sugar and acid, maybe? It was missing something), but overall it was nice. The hollandaise was decent, tasted like it had beer in it or something. Hubby didn't love his bacon, I tried a small bite and it was ok- super smokey, but had a nice sweetness. Meat portions seemed small, but my kale and grav lax were generously laid out. Hubby didn't love his meal, I think the hollandaise and the meat weren't to his liking. I like smokey flavours, and really appreciate a small, focused menu, so this was right up my alley.  My sister and I loved the house made biscuits (the base of the Benny), but the guys at the table weren't as impressed. They were really dense and difficult to cut into, but we managed. I liked them- probably going to do my eggs Benedict with biscuits instead of English muffins one day at home! So good!  We had sort of reverse sticker shock when our bill arrived- for four people, 7 Caesars between us, eggs bens and a side of fries (which were really good!), our total was like 140 before the tip. Not bad! So I really don't know about the people who were claiming this place is expensive or overpriced, I suspect they're just not familiar with Toronto prices. We actually thought it was a bargain, and the food quality was excellent.  Service is good. It's slow, but it's brunch so why rush a good thing?  Menu is fairly meat focused. Vegetarians have lots of great options elsewhere, and the kale sub on the benny is a nice touch for a veg alternative. Also, the FOH staff and kitchen are very easy going and happy to please, so I'm sure accommodations could be made if you asked nicely. For example, I wasn't charged extra for having both kale and lax on my Benny (it's supposed to be either-or), which I appreciated- it was a pleasant surprise, actually!  Overall, this brunch was great. Highly recommend!   NB- the score wasn't a perfect 5 because I agreed hubby's complaints about skimpy portions of over smoked bacon were valid, and also just because it's hard to get a perfect 5.. If I could have given an extra half star, I would. This place was very near perfect, in my book."}
{"text":"Not for me. Strange spices (for me, not everyone hates anise or fennel seeds) in everything and very small portions, but I can appreciate their flare for aesthetics."}
{"text":"I will preface this review by letting you know that I once went here for dinner, followed by dinner at the Daughter's the next night, then back to the Tavern for brunch. This was over a single weekend.   Love the casual, cabin-like vibe where the service is kind and knowledgeable about what's on the menu.  My usual order for brunch is the Mother & Child reunion, duck eggs served with duck in whatever method they've chosen for that week. IE: Breaded & fried, poached duck eggs with an oozy yolk and duck prosciutto. For the ultimate duckin' good time, opt for the foie gras on top - a luscious, perfectly seared neat lobe or two with a good chunk of bread to sop up every drop.   Dinner here is just as good, with the changing menu scrawled across the chalkboards on the wall. I suggest the steak to share!"}
{"text":"Arrived 5 min before it was closing for brunch, rushed with orders and was left with limited options. Staff was friendly and helpful and food was amazing. Will go back again and again to taste remaining items on the menu."}
{"text":"Meh. Not bad but not very memorable; probably not worth the prices. Definitely not worth having to have the waitress explain every single dish to the table because the menu is on one chalkboard by the entrance with no details."}
{"text":"Really liked the ambience of this restaurant.  The duck confit was a bit dry but the egg benedict was pretty good.  The interior decor was very homey and nice."}
{"text":"A solid brunch spot with decent sized patio, tasty food, and friendly staff. True to its name, all portions are definitely 'Farm-Sized' so bring your appetite!  Brunch today started with the most delicious CAESAR ($12) I've had in months. Extra spicy (w/ a kick of sriracha and horseradish), thick wedge of lemon and garnished with an oyster cradled in a slice of cucumber and topped with a caper-berry. *heaven* (just wish the oyster had been cold instead of room temp, which made me just a tiny bit apprehensive).  BOOZY COFFEE ($7) was nice but nothing special.  POACHED EGGS IN SQUASH ($14) is delish! 2 perfectly poached eggs nestled in half a small delicata squash roasted to sweet, smoky perfection (ideal for catching all the golden runny yolk). Served on a bed of mixed greens. VERY filling.  FRENCH TOAST ($14) was also fab: thick slices of fresh house-made soda bread fried in oodles of butter and topped with summer sweet peaches and whipped cream. Served with a side of ridiculously thick-cut BACON ($3). The  order only comes with 2 slices but each slice is like 2 regular slices stuck together... halfway between bacon and peameal.  A bit pricey for brunch... came to ~$60 for 2 plates, 2 drinks, incl taxes and tip but definitely would eat again. Especially since there was no wait/line up to get a table on a Saturday at 1130am!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, the service was very friendly, and the food was phenomenal. I ordered the Eggs Benny with bacon and it was delicious. I'm a New Yorker, but originally grew up in Texas where we know something about good biscuits and the biscuit that they use for their Benny dishes was one of the best I've ever had! I will definitely go back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a lovely warm day as my friends and I were bar hopping and on a search for the suitable patio weather. We stumbled upon this place online knowing that they served 1 dollar oysters so we decided to give it a shot.  I wasn't impressed with the service. When we were seated, no one told us about there were no physical menus, and they just served us water and left for a bit. Finally, some asked if we were ready to order, but we told we had no idea since we didn't have a menu. It took 3 servers to inform us the menu was placed on the board which was closer to the restaurant front. I believe that could be difficult for any one sitting at the back of the patio who would want to order.  They only had 3 beers on tap with a few I believe that they brewed themselves and a selection of cider. They had a pretty stock wine list for any drink fare you may be looking for.  We ended up trying the oysters, although our server misheard us and instead of confirming we wanted 12 oysters to start she brought us 35 (someone couldn't math and gave us one less..) It was also an additional dollar to have the hot sauce, vinegar and horseradish. Overall, the oysters were generally small and I didn't feel I was getting a good experience out of it."}
{"text":"Took my mother and some friends for brunch at the Farmhouse Tavern (real close to my home) and was very satisfied by the service, the environment and the food.  You know a restaurant is good if chefs across the city make their way there when not working themselves.  Highly recommend The Farmhouse and the owners new venture/location down the street - Farmers Daughter Eatery.  Have tried the shrimp and the burger (so far anyway) and... wow, both VERY tasty!  Definitely the best shrimp I've tried and the burger is up there on the top shelf also.   Do yourself a favour and drop by either location.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Delightful!  Went for dinner with a friend. Atmosphere was warm, candlelit, comfy. Was busy but we could still easily hear each other across the table. Foie gras three ways was delicious. Roasted veggie main was filling, earthy, full of flavour and filling. Warm apple tart dessert was heavenly. Nice wine selection. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dinner here today. Great service and food was delicious. We had the burger which had a poached egg and goat cheese and also the vegetarian entree which had all sorts of goodies and foraged items. The appetizers we're also great with smoked asparagus (they have a smoker right there in the patio) and sampler platter. Love it and will be back!"}
{"text":"Just spent a rather lengthy 2 hours of brunch on the FARMHOUSE tavern patio (1 course only!)  most of it being ignored by our unapologetically inept server.  Sad to discover that this is just another example of a Toronto restaurant with a hipster scene focus executed in an unprofessional and inexperienced environment.  A place with service this crappy would never survive in a high rent downtown zone. No offer of explanation for the chalkboard menu items- even such vaguely named dishes as \"Mother and Child Reunion\" are left to our interpretation.  An unidentified Pinot Grigio \"It's a really good one\" arrives. Service disintegrates from there on in.  No water, no specials, no checking in, no smile, just attitude....At several points I wonder if our server's shift has ended as she is never on the patio.  Sooo......the food.  They are well known for their burger, I won't bother to re-describe it, and it's great.  It's really messy though, with goat cheese and egg yolk pouring everywhere, and no you will not be able to get another napkin no matter how desperate the situation.   Fries look great, but when you bite in are weirdly dry and flavourless.  The ploughman's platter is dull and uninspired, including 3 different colours of cauliflower with an unfortunate number off tiny black bugs residing within.  The pancakes were crap.  Dry and mealy with lots of flecks of flax meal - no syrup and lots of smoky fruit.  When we were finished our dirty plates sat for a good 30 minutes in front of us with no offer of anyone coming to clear them.  There were wasps all over them, which was the most entertaining part of an otherwise depressing and disappointing meal.  The real sting came when the bill arrived and we realized why our server couldn't have cared less about serving us - a mandatory 18% gratuity was added to the bill for our party of six.  Yes, six.  Unbelievable."}
{"text":"We thought we'd try out this restaurant because I read such great reviews about the brunch menu here. We didn't come her for Brunch but I must say their dinner was a lot of fun and so delicious. What strange magic does the chef do to the steak? It was out of this world. Had to be the best steak we've ever tasted! It was smoked and crispy on the (in just the right way) and perfectly cooked on the inside (my husband and I like raw steaks).  I had a lamb pasta which I must say was fabulous! The pasta was obviously made from scratch and everything tasted perfect.   Dessert was bread pudding a lovely sweet end to a wonderful meal.   Don't worry about dressing up, cause the decor is homey and comfortable. I showed up in a t shirt with a Staples logo on it, and didn't feel out of place ( I was just coming from work and didn't have time to change)   We reserved for Brunch and are looking forward to trying out that famous Cesar of theirs."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday with my mother. Great thing about Sundays is the oysters special before 6pm is $1 each, and between 6 and 7 is a beer special. Arriving at 5:45 was perfect as we capitalized on both!  All the food seemed really fresh & local, which was nice. Oysters were from BC (a little less local), but delicious. The courses definitely had their share of creams and the food definitely had its richness. It'd be nice if they dialed the cream back a touch.  You know how natural & fresh the food is when you see them take the grilled butternut squash from the grill outside to the kitchen!  It's a great neighbourhood find, and I'm sure we'll be back again."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprises by Farmhouse. I took a group of friends there for dinner and it was lovely. We had the back room, which is their private dining area. Menu is small but thoughtful. Between the 8 of us we covered most everything on the menu. Charcuterie board was good - a bit heavy on things being pickled, but good. Mains were all quite good, but I gotta say the burger was great. I would happily go back. The only downside of the back room is that there's no music (which may not be a big deal to most) and the bathrooms were a wee bit malodorous."}
{"text":"Excellent personable and knowledgeable waitstaff! Unfortunately we came a bit late but they very kindly took us in. Great farm to table food!!! So delicious, all made in house"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday for the F*CK Monday special from a recommendation by a few friends. They were talking up on how great the place was and as always, you go in with a bit of skepticism of something being really as good as someone says. Needless to say, my mind was blown to bits. The wow factor was just wow. We shared a bunch of entrees: 1) I love meat - just absolutely mouth watering and tender 15oz ribeye, enough to feed 2 people or 1 hungry dude. It came with a salad over too half a long bone filled with marrow a side of these beef cubes that were delicious. It was perfectly and seemed naturally seasoned  2. Rainbow trout - seared perfectly over a top a saucy salad. Had an Asian fusioned type of taste. Very tender and juicy and fresh piece of fish  3. Threesome - foie gras, duck proschuitto and this type of paste. Absolutely incredible. Just the richness and flavour was amazing. 1 dish might be too much for 1 person. Recommend splitting amongst 2-3 people  4. Squash gnocchi - served with rapini. Great texture overall with the soft gnocchi and the firm rapini served in a rich squash based sauce topped with some parm.  5. Apple crumble and chocolate pudding for dessert - just so good. Fresh farm apples.   Price: extremely affordable. 87$ for all of this (party of 3) and we also had 3 beers. We were stuffed.  Service: A++"}
{"text":"Worst food I've had in a while, felt sick the next morning, probably because 1/2 my fish was raw and was touching other food. Friend's gnocchi was described as tasting like \"tater tots\", I tried them, they were disgusting. My friends came here because they liked it the last time they went, they did not seem to enjoy it this time. I found it noisy. I did not see anything on the menu or on our table that would be an incentive to return. It is an out of the way location, plus it's expensive. I don't eat meat, maybe the meat stuff is better, they really did not seem to have a grasp on how to prepare vegetables. If I lived nearby, I might go just to get drinks."}
{"text":"All in all this stead is worth coming by. Nice looking, the staff were knowledgeable, polite and helpful. I would recommend it.  Though we had a late visit and my meal was the last before the cook went home, what I had, their egg burger, was truly wonderful."}
{"text":"Can't complain about this brunch! We were off to a great start Sunday morning - being able to make a reservation makes brunch so much more pleasant.   Cozy atmosphere, with the added touch of blankets at the table.   Went with four friends, and we all went for different meals. I got the eggs benny, my partner got the Farmer's breakfast, and our buds got the Mother and Child and Eggs in a Nest. And we all enjoyed them very much!  Great option for a nice brunch, with unique and delicious menu options. Will be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner a few years back and was blown away by the food; in particular a half butternut squash cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Recently returned for dinner with friends for a special night out, and am regretting going.   The meal was very mediocre: ploughman's platter was sparse, with too many picked items, and mustard, without enough to balance it out.   Shared the $45 steak with veggies with a friend. Steak came out bleeding and had to send it back; it came back very bitter and almost inedible.  It was also incredibly fatty (about 5 mouthfuls of pure fat).   The veggie platter was very uninspired; half a purple cabbage and barely cooked carrots, and some other bored veggies. One member had the burger, which reportedly was good (should have chosen that over the steak).  The meal was pricey; if I go out to eat, I'd like to think that I'm eating food that I can't or won't cook at home, and at least, tastes better that I can make (I'm not that good of a cook either). The veggies were bland and boring, nothing like what we enjoyed here a few years back.  For what we paid, I expect better. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"When I moved to Toronto, years ago, I heard of the name \"Farmhouse Tavern\" more than once. Now that I live in the area, I had a chance to go several times. Their menu changes weekly, meaning fresh and seasonal which I think contributes to the popularity of Farmhouse. Not overly a huge fan of the patio but the décor inside is what gives more of an understanding of Farmhouse. Don't be discouraged it looks small once you walk in the front door, but you're only seeing the \"Tavern\" side. If you turn the corner to where the kitchen is situated, there's additional restaurant seating. Same Menu. The wait staff is superbly knowledgeable but almost to a point that when describing some attributes to the dishes sometimes it may turn you away. Your best luck is going with your gut or taking a peek at what your neighbour ordered. The Butcher's Board is a must but don't be fooled everyone is going to want to take a bite if you order it for yourself.  Also, best time to go is on Sunday. You can have brunch and stay all day as every hour they have a new special from, $1 oysters, inexpensive wine and beer etc depending on the hour."}
{"text":"Very good food, great service, inventive and fresh menu, local pride!  Love all the Ontario wines they featured.  Our dinners were excellent.     We will definitely return to try the fall menu."}
{"text":"French toast and eggs in a nest - Delish! Love the quaintness, the food, and the service. and, apparently so do others, there was a line up out the door."}
{"text":"Why are all the great brunch spots in the junction and roncevalles?  Farmhouse Tavern is another perfect example of this.  I wish these guys were closer.  I hear they source all their ingredients locally, which is a cool bonus.  First of all, you can apparently make reservations here for brunch.  We were lucky to snag a table later on in the afternoon.  Warning though, you may not be able to experience everything on the menu as by the time we finished (around 2pm on Sunday) they had few items left.  The menu is drawn on a chalkboard on the wall.  The eggs benny is great.  Hollandaise sauce wasn't lacking, which I find is common.  You also have the option of smoked trout or kale for vegetarians instead of bacon (go with the bacon).  I had the mother and son reunion, which was two fried soft boiled eggs and duck proscuitto slices.  If you're not that hungry or never tried a fried soft boiled egg this is a great option, otherwise it was not filling.  Had a sticky bun as well:  a huge cinnamon bun topped with ice cream and apple slices.  Definitely a share item for up to 4 people if you want dessert with your brunch.  Coffee is served in vintage mugs and bottomless.  They're caesars are quite popular and come in mason jars with a mussel as part of the garnish.  Service here is spectacular.  The owner is friendly and tried his best to make space for us.  The wait staff was talkative and cheerful, giving us suggestions and double checking on items that were crossed out on the menu.  There are dozens of brunch spots in Toronto, but I will definitely be returning here!"}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding! Best brunch ever had.   Different type of menu of what you normally would have somewhere else. And for those items that are usually common for brunch, here they are paired with different food you are used to (i.e. gravlax, kale or foie gras)  I had the pleasure to order: - Eggs Benny in Kale with gravlax (smoked in-house rainbow trout).  - Mother and child reunion (duck and egg) with foie gras.   Everything cooked to perfection with well balanced flavour.   Everything here is home made and bought from local sustainable farms. A hidden gem in the outskirts of the Junction area.   A must if you want a healthy-happy experience.   I'll definitely come back to experience more."}
{"text":"We had been meaning to try the brunch at Farmhouse Tavern for a while, so off to the Junction (triangle) we went. Although they had a bustling summer patio going on, we opted to seat inside. I guess that authentic farmhouse experience came with an aromatic waft that we carried around for the rest of the afternoon. In retrospect, it was worth it.   The brunch menu is written on a chalkboard, and is not too extensive. As a yelp elite, you can get claim a second alcoholic drink for free (yay!!). Unlimited coffee. Always a bonus. Service was great and the waitress was very approachable. We opted for the eggs benny (with daikon) and the Mother and Child reunion with some bacon on the side ($15).   The Mother and Child was a beautifully presented platter, consisting of a righteous crispy duck egg and layered smoked duck filet. Definitely not your average brunch dish. I would say it was quite unique and a definite winner. The eggs benny were executed perfectly. I would try out their dinner menu for sure. When i'm feeling carnivorous that is."}
{"text":"Driving along Dupont on a Saturday evening, saw this neat little place while stopped at a red light and decided to pop in for dinner.  We sat on the patio and was greeted by super friendly staff immediately. Drink order was taken right away and was quite pleased with the beer selection.  The menu was on a chalkboard which was nice and simple and our super informed server was able to answer the million questions I always seem to have while trying to make the best decision for my meal!  We started with a couple of appetizers of twice baked beets and venison tartare. Wow. The flavors on each dish were incredible, and both were super fresh.  For our mains my Mr. decided on the burger and I had the short rib pasta. Sooo good! His burger was sloppy, but we were warned! My pasta was perfect. Noodles cooked just right and the beef was crazy tender.  The reason for the missing star was for the weird plastic outdoor chairs and the steep stairs to get to the basement bathroom! Nothing to do with the food or the service."}
{"text":"Happily upgrading my review to 5 stars.  We went on Sunday, which means that all sorts of things are on discount throughout the evening. Reason: they only open Thursday - Sunday, so they want to get rid of everything on Sunday. Everything is fresh and local.  The Hubster had the burger, which was ABSOLUTELY gigantic. RIght after he ordered and before i could decide on an order, another server scratched it off the menu. Our server made sure that he would get a burger, despite them being out. The burger was apparently very delicious and had a giant piece of pork belly on it. The fries and homemade ketchup were really good.  I had the ribeye steak, which was INCREDIBLY. I asked for it rare, and it came medium rare but it was still really good. That's something I find about beef, if it's really good, I'm totally okay with it being cooked more than I like. If it's NOT good, it's upsetting.  The steak came with a big marrow bone and I opted for a slice of foie gras. INCREDIBLE. I literally have half that steak in my fridge right now, and it looks like I haven't eaten any of it. The thing must have started off at close to 15oz.   Service was some of the best we've ever had. Our server had this great dry wit that kept cracking me up, and even cracked up the Hubster, the biggest comedy snob in the world (I've made him laugh out loud maybe a dozen times in our decade together). He was also very accommodating, as things kept coming off the menu as they ran out. He would either try to get it for us anyway, or refer us to something that we might like instead.  I love the idea of a restaurant where everything is super fresh and local. It definitely comes out in the flavours and the love that the chef and servers feel for the restaurant comes out in everything else.   A FANTASTIC meal and just incredible dining experience altogether. We'll definitely be back again.  Oh, and the first time we came, we didn't order food because we thought things were a bit pricy. Considering the quantity and the quality you get, this place is a steal!  The restaurant is also bigger than it looks and has a private party room and an outdoor patio"}
{"text":"Worth the trek, it's actually so delicious. Love the brunch there! Cute atmosphere and great staff!"}
{"text":"Stupid pretentious. Food was ok and and the prices are fine, but the service was terrible"}
{"text":"Bartender needs an attitude adjustment. LARGE. (Server was fantastic, tipped him very generously, hopefully they don't pool tips!)   Everything is half price after 9 which is great because everything is way overpriced ($46 steak - WTF! Your name had better start with 'G' and end in 'ordon Ramsay' to feel justified charging that).   Drinks... They don't have a drink menu so we asked the server.  Partner ordered the Junction beer on recommendation of the server. Didn't like it (personal preference, we both found it EXTREMELY yeasty).  I asked for an amaretto sour but they don't stock amaretto in their bar rail so the server called the bartender out to go over my options. Bartender asked what I like, what I don't like. I answered sweet and tart (which is why I like the AS) and no whiskey or tequila. Ten minutes later, he (bartender) delivers a tequila drink... I say it's tequila and that I said the only things I didn't want were whiskey and tequila. He just stared at me and walk back inside, not so much as an apology. The server came by shortly after to check on us and I explained, he apologized, asked what I wanted (to which I responded again, no whiskey or tequila) and that he would have another drink made up for me. That drink was brought out later by the bartender who didn't apologize (STILL), dropped it on the table with no eye contact without saying anything and walked about 5 feet before turning around and saying \"Round 2\" snidely...  (Picture a snooty French butler) UGH.   I ordered the burger which they're known for. Came with a side of fries. Normally $20 but paid $10 since we were there after 9PM. Fries were delicious, burger was pretty good but incredibly messy which made it tough to eat (literally falls apart in your hands as you eat it).  Partner ordered steak - steak was okay according to him. I tried some and while the steak was decent, the chef did NOT trim the fat! How do you charge $46 for a fatty steak?! Couldn't stop raving about the corn on the cob.   Total bill for two mains and two drinks (at half price, remember) - about $50. Didn't feel it was worth it given the poor service from the bartender and there is NO way I would have even considered paying $100 for that meal and service (again, server was AWESOME, bartender was a DICK). Ridiculous."}
{"text":"*Brunch Review- only tried once but would go again to try to upgrade my review- it shows that this is a new place..but I would try it again to get a more polished experience because the staff are so incredibly nice and the menu looks like it has potential*  Came here about noon on a saturday for brunch -Tiny menu 4 items (a frenchtoast-ish option, benny option, standard 2-egg breakfast and the ploughman's platter) -the table ordered a benny and the the standard breakfasts.  I'm a purist and always get whatever standard basic breakfast they have- eggs poached extra soft, dry toast on their brown/whole grain option. (if choice between sausage or bacon i always get sausage).  Their version of the 2 egg breakfast contained: -2 eggs any style -pork terrine -scalloped potato -quarter loaf of small freshly baked/homemade round bread   Price: 11/12$? (I forget- but it was more than 10+  Now ingredients are all supposed to be local, organic etc.   This is generally not a big sell for me- I don't care much as long as it tastes good.  I am assuming the price reflects the quality of the ingredients.  the problem is that I couldn't tell the difference.  (I have been to my fair share of organic local/grown ingredient-based menus in Toronto and elsewhere and have been able to -mostly- taste the difference and have been happy to pay the premium)  Eggs- poached soft- I couldn't put my finger on it..but the eggs didnt' seem to be poached properly.  They use two small eggs, supposed to be locally sourced eggs- the yolk was a very very pale colour and, if it make sense- the pach was watery.  Like..it wasn't a firm white and a burst yolk- the entire thing was watery... and the taste- well it certainly didn't taste like anything special.  I was excited to try to terrine- which is rare on a brunch menu let alone a menu.  Unfortunately it wasn't a terrine.  Terrine is supposed to be a pate-like loaf of fatty meat.  What they gave me was a shredded meat, mixed with seasoning, onions etc, and then pan fried- formed into a patty-like structure.  It was good (not great)- but it wasn't terrine  Scalloped potato- unconventional.  But call me low-brow- I enjoy my standard hash browns.  The problem with scalloped potatoes is that I feel they do this because it is more cost effective and they can prep it, bake it before and then give you a small 2 inch slice and call it a day.  Not impressed.  Again, it wasn't bad.  But it wasn't good- and it certainly doesn't properly replace the hash brown portion of a breakfast.  The bread- was good, I liked how they had loaves in front of an open-ish kitchen.  They looked fresh- but nothing I couldn't source easily from st. lawrence.  Still, better than regular bread you get at a greasy spoon (but yeah..on par with my expectations).  They give you a part of a loaf so it isn't sliced.  The concept of the resto is a farmhouse and a farmhouse, indeed.  The chefs in the kitchen looked busy, professional and the kitchen looked clean. The two-sided resto looked awesome layout wise and I would likely want to try dinner here if reviews seemed good.  But otherwise it is pricey for both what it is and for the neighbourhood.  The staff, in general LOOKED new.  And I understand the place just opened.  And that it will take awhile to finesse- it certainly didn't bother me because the place is so new- but a word of caution- \"sorry, i'm not sure --but let me check!\" was a common response (but they were enthusiastic, courteous and lovely about it I certainly would not go out of my way to go here- and even if I were in the neigbhourhood, I would most likely choose things that are more tried tested and true in the junction. -they have a sizeable patio that, while still looks rough, would be lovely to dine on.  ps: our server (hannah?) was incredible, beautiful, helpful and sweet- an A+ server"}
{"text":"Yelp brought us to this restaurant in our neighbourhood and it is worth a visit.  We've passed by this area many times and have never noticed it as it is in an area not typical for restaurants.  It had bustling traffic on a Saturday evening with seating on an outdoor patio and indoors.  Tables are cozy and decor is very rustic.  Menu is on the wall chalkboards and offerings are comparatively limited.  We ordered the Ploughmans Platter, Big Fish and dessert of the day (a deconstructed cherry crumble pie).  Very shareable plates and plenty to go around.  The crowd picked up as the evening progressed and it's nice to see.  Would recommend as a great dinner hang-out."}
{"text":"Ate here last weekend, simply fantastic.  Very limited menu, but that's on purpose - what they do, they do well!  Delivery was excellent, service was warm and knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend to anybody looking for a nice, romantic restaurant."}
{"text":"came for brunch with friends. The service was very nice. We ordered two hey buttercup (one vegetarian and other with bacon) and a mother and child reunion with $12 add-on foie gras.   $14( or 16 with bacon) hey buttercup: it was basically a huge salad with 2 poached eggs and a huge baked butter-squash. Overall, this dish was a very light and healthy brunch option and it was very filling. Prob not the best option for people who s looking for a traditional hearty-satisfying brunch. It's a salad! You know what I meant.   $13 Mother & child reunion: this is dish is the opposite of hey buttercup. Deep fried duck eggs and house cured duck prosciutto with salad and a piece of bread. The portion of this dish is so small compared to the hey buttercup we ordered. But it tasted good!!   $12 add on foie gras: It has too be high quality because of the size they served compared to the price. TOO SMALL! It is literally just a size of one bite. Check out my photos and compare with the dried eggs on the side.   Over all it was a good experience, but I will not order the foie gras again."}
{"text":"The Farmhouse Tavern has long been on my list of \"to-try\" places, but being so out-of-the-way I actually had to make it a mission to venture out to the Junction Triangle.  Don't try \"dropping in\" as they take reservations and if you don't have one then be prepared to wait.  The hospitality is great here though, as if you have to wait they send you waiting with a brown bag of goodies to nosh on.    Ever since the Hoof Café closed down I have been looking for a worthy replacement.  The haute food, made with simple ingredients without the aura of snobbery takes the Farmhouse from understudy to prima donna.  (And if you tweet at them, at least they respond).  They really take the Farmhouse part of their namesake seriously with all sorts of knick knacks befitting a farmhouse as decor.  Mismatched glasses give the place an overall homey feel with a yoke and various taxidermy lining the walls.  There's the main dining room and a second dining room (where the open kitchen is).  If you like a lot of natural lighting, stick with the main dining room.  I personally like to be near the open kitchen, where all the action is happening.  Tip to all Yelpers - if you check-in and buy an alcoholic beverage, you'll get a second free.  I stuck with coffee this time.  The menu is not the most descriptive because seriously who the hell would know what \"Mother and Child Reunion\" means?  Or \"Cover Girl\"?  Just means that the servers have to do a little more explaining than usual unless you're a \"regular.\"  Maybe that's how they weed you out?  We opted for the Barnyard Burger - which is my favourite burger of 2013.  A juicy beef patty wedged between a duck fried egg, creamy goat cheese and a slab of thick cut bacon that had me going oinkers.  This is all held together in a nicely toasted sesame bun and side of fries.    I opted for the \"Mother + Child Reunion\" which consisted of duck prosciutto and 2 poached, fried duck eggs.  Just don't think about the name while you're eating it because it's kind of twisted and sick if you think about it.  So just don't!  Oh, and I added a slab of foie gras for $9 extra.    The bill (including 2 coffees) before tax and tip came to about $60, which is a little on the pricier side of things.  But I'm of the opinion that as long as the food is yummy, then it's money well-spent.    I am definitely going to be back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and there was quite a wait. It was absolutely amazing food. Servers vibes are great too."}
{"text":"Food was different -- in a good way! This place has great and funky brunch alternatives from your usual eggs and bacon. Food was great, drinks were refreshingly different and the atmosphere was funky! Be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch spots in the city, by far. Their hangover poutine is the cure for all maladies and the answer to world peace. Staff are beautiful and very friendly and make you feel like you're in the comfort of your cozy living room."}
{"text":"I feel the same as Melissa F, where I wasn't too impressed, but I would come back. Actually, I'm interested in trying their dinner one day.   We came for brunch after Ada T's rave reviews (she's already been back twice!) on a Saturday afternoon. The interior was really cozy and rustic, but a little dark. I was torn between sitting inside or on the patio. We opted for the patio.  The service was really friendly and seems like a great neighbourhood spot.   The brunch menu is small, but enough. I highly recommend the BREAD PUDDING topped with carmelized onions, and bacon. It's filling, sweet and savoury at the same time.   The EGGS BENNY was also good too, all home made - loved the crunchy bisquit and the bacon - the salad was a bit sour.   We also all shared the $22 Ploughman's Platter. From the description the server gave us, it seemed like it would be a lot of food. We were disappointed when we saw the sparse plate. It would have also been nice if she had explained to us what each item was. There was two small teeny oysters, something sour/bitter in a cup, terrine, small radish salad, big piece of baguette, 2 bacons and a coleslaw. For that amount of money I expected more (and we had thought that the 4 of use would share the entire thing, I\"m not even sure if this is filling enough for one person).   I would come back however - eggs beeny and bread pudding is worth the visit.  Reservations can be made, but wasn't necessary today."}
{"text":"The food is creative and tastes amazing, interior for the hipster crowd indeed. Even the dish names are clever, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot. Service is outstanding and the food is out of this world. Love that meat eating is alive and well in Toronto. The burger with the goose is my person fav."}
{"text":"Very cozy, down to earth, and delightful menu.  Came here on a Saturday evening for dinner and grabbed a seat on the patio. No fuss, super casual, and we hung out for a couple of hours.   Got a cocktail (can't remember what it was called) - it was very refreshing. Somthing with Gin...  The chalkboard menu showcased fresh, local ingredients, and they all looked so good! We got the fish dish, and the cheese/ characterize platter. So good!  No fuss - if you are looking for a low-key evening with good company... this is the place to go. I'd love to check out their brunch menu some time."}
{"text":"I was here with my two kids early in the day.  Since it wasn't busy it worked out okay.  They had one high chair, but I don't think I would bring them for dinner, others may get annoyed, since it's a small trendy restaurant.  From the many pictures on Yelp I had already decided to get the ploughmans platter.  The presentation was beautiful.  Especially the duck confit which included the leg, claws and all.  My son loved it so much he chewed every bit of meat off it, right down to the meat on the knuckles of the claw.  My one complaint is there were too many pickled items and then a tonne of mustards on and around it.  It makes for very acidic flavours and not really anything to match it up with on the plate.  I would probably have not noticed if this was a share plate with a few others.  I am also sure from seeing other dishes, that there's a lot more to this restaurant that I will need to come back to experience."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger for an early dinner because that was one of three menu options during the \"transition\" between lunch and dinner.   Burger would have been tasty but was severely undercooked and totally not edible. Nobody came to check on us after food came, even had to chase down a different server to ask for the bill after waiting forever for someone to notice.  I should note that there were not a lot of customers, but the servers were just standing around chatting. I regretted not complaining about the undercooked meat and ended up eating around the edges that were edible.   Their food is decent, but super overpriced and it gets old pretty quick. Fries are yummy. Service is fine, but definitely not outstanding.   Won't plan on coming back anytime soon! Luckily some good new brunch spots have opened up in the area (secret lands, lovechix)"}
{"text":"Food: outstanding, local, fresh, abundant and inspired. Service: rude, hated my table of 6 as equally as a table of two the three times I've gone. My bad for coming in for your awesome food, beer and wine selection! Next time I'll stay home and prepare it myself... :'p no I won't,  I'm lazy. Good thing there is 100 other restaurants to try! Seriously though, the food kept me coming back, the staff made me want to run away."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Farmhouse Tavern for our anniversary dinner.  Friends have talked it up so we went with high expectations.  Let me first set the evening, I made reservations at 6:45 on a Thursday and we arrived on time.  It was a beautiful evening so we decided to sit on the patio.  The restaurant was not busy when we arrived, but a few couples arrived shortly after we were seated.  While I prefer casual dining, the ambience was a little too casual for my tastes.  The patio tables were made out of patio/walkway slabs,  just a little too high to be comfortable.  Also, the base of the table was made from old tractor parts (again, not overly comfortable, not enough space for a couple to rest their feet.)  We ordered an appetizer for sharing, and 2 mains and no dessert (I had arranged for dessert elsewhere) and some wine.  The heirloom tomato tart was very good.    For the main course I ordered the burger and my wife ordered a ravioli and both were good. There seemed to be a long time lag between courses, though we were not in a hurry. (Some diners arrived after us and departed before)   One of the unfortunate consequences of eating on the patio, you are at the mercy of the traffic, and for some reason a street washing truck decided to wash the street during our meal. It was very noisy and distracting.  Our server was very attentive.  The bottom line - food was good (but with the hype from friends, I had great expectations and I don't think the food lived up to our expectations). The pasta was the best of the 3 dishes we tried.    The service was good.   I would go back, but I am not in a specific rush."}
{"text":"Wow! What a hidden treasure! This place is charming and decorated like a trendy well...you guested it- a farmhouse. This place is super cool without all the pretence of king/queen streets and not one beard or 'I'm trying hard to be a hipster' toque in sight! Great food in a really relaxed atmosphere. We had the lamb, trout and fois gras and all were tasty.  Service was friendly but slow and inattentive so don't go if you are in a hurry. For the price point, service could be stepped up a bit thus the 4/5."}
{"text":"Good food... horrible service  I came here on a Sunday for brunch and there was no wait.  They asked if we wanted to sit inside but all they had was bar sitting.  So we asked to sit outside.  They told us we can sit anywhere but scold at us when we choose a table for 4... um shouldn't have said anywhere.  So once we got all our stuff and moved they got our drinks.  I got hot coffee.  The person I came with asked for ice coffee but they only had hot coffee.  The coffee tasted watered down so we knew we had to go somewhere else after for coffee instead.    The waitress didn't really ask if it was our first time or explained the menu.  She just told us where the menus were.  They had two menus that were large hanging chalkboards which I thought was kinda cool.  There were 7 different options on their menu.  I went with their Benny w/ Kale ($13).  The person I came with choose their Mother & Child Reunion ($16).  My two benedicts included delicious biscuits topped with some kale, smoked ham, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce.  It was served with a salad.  I thought the entire dish was pretty good.  As for the Mother & Child Reuion, it included a duck leg topped with some cranberry served on a piece of bread served with a fried duck egg and some purple coleslaw.  It was served on a wooden board.  It was also pretty good.  The meat was flavored and cooked perfectly.    As for service, our waitress failed to come by to ask us if everything was okay or if we needed anything.  We never got refills on our waters or asked for more coffee.  We called her to ask for pepper but she brought back an empty pepper mill.  The restaurant is small.  There is a small outdoor patio.  Seating is a little tight.  The guy behind me was literally back to back with me.  On the day we came it was extremely windy.  Although the food was good, the lack of service left a bad taste in our mouths.  Not sure if I would come back."}
{"text":"Review has been along time coming. Rude staff(they will try and talk you into buying more of there crappy product. And the beer forget it unless you're a fan of handcrafted beer."}
{"text":"Was it just all of us that didn't like this place or are all these great reviews from family and friends?  Six of us sat for dinner and only one thought their meal was a pass. From burger to fish to a veggie 'stew' swimming in beet puree it all missed the mark.  Burger: features goat cheese a fried duck egg and thick cut back bacon, iceberg lettuce and is made from prime rib beef $20 served with fries.  Well it's a mess of a burger I felt like the scene from season one of Breaking Bad where Walter had to bathed off with a hose in a kiddie pool. Not recommended if you are on date or are an environmentalist as you'll need a stack of napkins. And the back bacon was so thick and fatty that i couldn't bite through it and it kept pulling out from the bun - that and it wasn't a $20 burger.  Georgian Bay Rainbow Trout: $21 with wild mushrooms and some other small loose items running about the plate. We had two order this meal and both were MASSIVELY DISAPPOINTED in the portion/value and the presentation.   The Veggie Stew in the beet puree wasn't eaten by the person who ordered it as she found it inedible from a taste perspective and I had to agree - it was rather awful (the person with the small fish portion ate most of it).  The restaurant is cut into two in the inside, but also features a patio (which looked quite nice).  The 'kitchen' side was noisy and seated in the corner under a speaker made hearing one another difficult and the server's description of the menu virtually impossible.  The wine by the glass (Chardonnay @ $13 and Pinot Grigio @ $9) were overpriced and I wouldn't recommend the Chardonnay as it wasn't that great.  The fries were good and the local Junction IPA was stellar - but after $260 we learned our lesson not to visit again.  I couldn't wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"The Eat Local Movement is alive and well over at Farmhouse Tavern!  Farmhouse Tavern should pride itself (if it doesn't already) on the fact that they have an amazing, locally sourced menu. The beers, the liquor and the food are all as locally sourced as possible and I absolutely love that! Their menu changes on the daily, based on what's available. It's always fresh, always tasty and they even have a wonderful patio!   Located up on Dupont, it was definitely worth the trek and I would recommend to anyone who is looking for healthy, local eats. The service is wonderful as well! I hear they've also got delicious brunch...I might be back sooner than I think.   My one point of contention with Farmhouse tavern is that they have a very limited menu. I am not a picky eater, but I would love a few more options. That's just me though! Keep up the good work, Farmhouse!"}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch in a country kitsch environment. Had the Morning Threesome for brunch: duck confit, deep-fried duck egg, and duck fois gras. Juice was yummy and the \"Bunch Pots\" (fried potatoes) were great. Cheddar biscuit was fine, but I wouldn't order it again. It's far in the West End for us, but worth the drive, so we'll be back."}
{"text":"Very hairy. First there was a long blonde hair in my orange juice (I am not blonde). Then another long hair appeared at the base of the pepper grinder. That was the last straw for me. Sadly, the servers were too busy to notice or even check in with us during our meal. The eggs benny was OK, but overpriced. This place used to be a high quality establishment and neighbourhood gem, but has fallen into serious disrepair. Ownership should take note and make changes."}
{"text":"very cozy environment. we went at noon so there is only brunch menu to chose from. the food is delicious and came out at a reasonable speed. Price is okay.   too bad it is far from where i live"}
{"text":"Okay, so I almost never write reviews as I think it's a waste of time, but the food was so amazing that I just have to spread the word (although they don't seem to need it cause the place is fully packed every night).   I usually find the restaurants's food to always taste the same because, let's face it we all use the same ingredients, meat, fries, sauces, eggs. Well, yesterday, I ordered a burger and it truly was an explosion of taste, I was so impressed  by the quality of the products, I'm probably going to sound crazy but it felt like the ingredients were grown, prepared and cooked with love, which I believe is the key ingredient to a good meal. Plus the prices are reasonable!  And forget about those comments about the service (seriously, have you ever been a waiter/ress? can you imagine how hard it must be?) and the decor, who cares about the decor, it's not a lounge bar (however the decoration is very good although I hardly noticed it because the food was so good)  So you're all set, you MUST go there! All you need is some good friends (that way you can try each others plates), a fork and - don't forget that part - a reservation!"}
{"text":"Had a great steak (Ribeye), asparagus was delicious.  Service very good, people friendly. Music background was really good. Will go back in my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Brunch  Food:  The Burger, tastes good, a little messy, but for $20?  A little too pricy.  I liked the fries a lot.  I just found it weird there was no condiment to be served with the fries. The Steak and Eggs:  Too much fat on the steaks to be charging $30... 1/4 of the beef was fat, absolutely unacceptable.  The salad was also very little.  Be warned, the drinks are expensive.  Service:  Service was fast which was good; however if you had questions about the meal/drink they became defensive.  Ambiance:  The interior decorator for the place has interesting taste, while risky, i think it works... the bathroom feels nice even though its small and cramp.  Music was too loud that it became hard to talk while talking with the person across from you.  I wouldn't bring friends back here for the following reasons: 1) The food is either a hit / miss.  Just too much fat in their meat. 2) Service can have a bit of attitude... but maybe they were at the end of their shift. 3) The bill will be a lot more than you expected and will leave some with receipt shock, especially if people didn't like their food."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and had to always make reservations. Their menu selections are great, with a variety of meats to choose from. I find some of their dinner entrees a tad bit salty, specifically the steak. But still, one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Farmhouse was a great experience. We went there on a first date with only Yelp reviews to go by. While the food seemed a little overpriced, it did taste great! We went on a Sunday night, which meant we were there for \"F*ck Mondays!\", with rolling happy hours every hour and $1 oysters before 5pm. I had the Ploughman's Platter and my date had the Surf and Turf. I know the Ploughman's was better and certainly had more bang for the buck in terms of variety. The steak tasted good, but left a lot of sinew on the board. The wines are all from Ontario and we were both surprised to find one we liked during the $8 a glass after 8pm happy hour.  Our host and waiter Antonio was awesome! Very personable and fun with the air that he might just sit down and enjoy the meal with you! Great service. The pinnacle of our night was well, two-fold... the first was when my date led me to the front door area of the restaurant to teach me how to rumba and then some swing dancing to Neil Young. It was altogether hilarious and a blast. The second was when we had the \"New York Dessert\", which is code for BEST KETTLE CORN ICE CREAM EVER!  Overall, I would return. The prices made it out of reach for me to call this my regular unfortunately... Dinner for 2 at $150 rather than closer to $100 or even $120, but the experience was positive.  Thanks Farmhouse!"}
{"text":"I feel like I'm wasting my money if it's not spent at farmhouse tavern.  The medium-rare. 15oz ribeye steak is cook perfectly EVERYTIME. Better than barbarians steak house ( and a fraction of the cost)  The burger has a slice of pork belly, goat cheese and a duck egg! Fresh potatoes double fried to make it extra crispy. Perfect for their home made spicy ketchup. You can also replace the fries with a unbelievably fresh salad.  The eggs Benedict with their biscuit was unlike anything I've had in my life. It's on an entirely different level.   I recommend this place to everyone that visits Toronto. If you live in Toronto there is no excuse to not try this place out.   When I tell people about it their expectations are always so high due the hype. Time and time again their experience was better than what they expected."}
{"text":"It's trying just a little too hard. It reminds me of Joe Beef in Montreal. The scene and the food are a just a touch TOO MUCH farm to table. Is that possible? Maybe. I get the whole rustic aesthetic. It's beautiful. But then the prices. Will people look back on our generation and laugh that we pay $25 for a brunch plate in an unfinished room with a half-painted wall and a door that's hanging sideways with cracked glass? Sometimes you have to laugh at fads.   We had to enter the restaurant from a room that looked like it was just one step up from a hoarder's garage sale. The host guardedly barked \"Are you here for something?\" Well yes, maestro. Brunch. Jeesh. Hello to you too!  Our waitress was beautiful and aloof, clad in Joe's Jeans and a cropped striped shirt that bared the tiniest swath of a toned waste. Her face was a perfect porcelain. At first I thought she was going to sell me makeup or designer clothing. But then, the descriptions of poached eggs, smoked caesars and foie gras lulled me back to the task at hand. The menu - only on the chalkboard, shockingly brief. Brevity is the soul of wit, yes, but I wasn't laughing here. Benedict, eggs in a nest (a sweet potato nest and side salad...oh no), duck confit, bread pudding. Not a BAD selection by any means, but certainly quite limited and all selections between $15-25. Drinks at least $10. Even for a mimosa.   Overall, it was a decent brunch in terms of the quality. The mother and child reunion had its highs and lows: the high was the fried duck egg. Gorgeous egg yolk with the perfect amount of runny vs structure. The low was the MINISCULE piece of foie gras, followed by the overcooked duck confit. The benedict was better, but not spectacular. So-so. And with the high price tag, I'd probably forego brunch at this place again in the future and hang back at a place where the floorboards are finished. Just kidding. But seriously. Sometimes a theme goes too far."}
{"text":"Our first impression was not great as the man who greeted us at the door was rude and seemed almost annoyed that we had come in to his restaurant.  Once he seated us our server seemed friendly but made a couple of snarky comments when we asked her to elaborate on the menu which was super vague.   Some of the food was delicious - the threesome was fantastic and the buttertart was to die for but most of it was just okay.  The spices added to the ketchup for the steak frites was kind of gross actually and the steak was definitely not too my liking. The exterior was dry and it also had an unusual flavour which I didn't like. It was way overpriced for what it was.  Overall I would not go back."}
{"text":"Great place! My main course was so-so but everyone else that I was with LOVED theirs so I felt like this deserved 4 stars instead of 3.  First of all their menu is all on the wall which is fine but nothing is described, we had to ask our server to describe pretty much every item on the menu to us but she was very friendly and willing to answer any questions.   I had the fancy salad for an appetizer and it was fancy indeed, all different kinds of veggies. Split the ploughman's platter with the table and it was ok, a LOT of food and we had 5 so it was a good size for us. The main course was so-so, I got the gnocchi and it tasted more like tater tots than gnocchi... Next time I would try the ravioli. I wasn't thaaattt into the dessert (we tried the ice cream and the panna cotta). Another downside is that they charge for water and brought us extra bread without us asking for it but then charged us for it. So be ready to spend money when you come here. The absolute best part was the free refill on check in!!! So be sure to check in.   The people I was with got the burger, the lamb, and the ravioli and they couldn't say enough good things. I would go back to try the ravioli for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for a private event, where the whole restaurant was rented out.  We started with oysters and it came with a vingearette at the bar which were delish. I asked the bar to make a drink that was fruity and I got a wonderful citrus cocktail in a cute vintage-esque glass.   Moving into the back seating room, with an open kitchen. Got the ploughmans platter for an appetizer and it is so big it can be an entree! It came with a fried duck leg, terrine, smoked salmon, a variety of cheese, pickled veggies and a pink egg with some bread, all on a big round wood cutting board, I was already full after this! The entree was a ribeye with duck fat brussels sprout, the steak was so tender and again such a large portion - I was in steak heaven, the brussel sprouts were a bit on the greasy side. Ending the meal with chocolate pudding in a mason jar. I left ridiculously full and ate way too much but was so worth it even if its a bit out of the way at the junction"}
{"text":"Specialty: Farm-to-fork - brunch and dinner Menu items: Eggs Benny, Smoked Chicken Crepe & Barnyard Burger  FARMHOUSE tavern is not your typical brunch spot with a set menu that runs year-long offering legacy brunch items such as scrambled eggs with sausage. This hipster-style spot located in the Junction triangle defies all traditional rules, with a simple farm-to-fork philosophy, exploring with versatile ingredients and offering innovative weekly brunch items.  With a rustic decor, farm-style, old country music playing in the background, FARMHOUSE tavern staff greets us the moment we arrive on location. The kitchen is completely open concept, almost an extension of the dinning area, and the chef and his staff chop, bake, fry and garnish as we eat. The food arrives at our table, and my mouth salivates. The vibrant colours of the food meet my eyes and I can not wait to dig in.  This is my first take at the FHT's always-on menu, Eggs Benny. The perfectly soft poached eggs are sitting on a buttery home-made cheese biscuit and covered in a freshly made hollandaise sauce. On bite, the flavours explode in a mildly symphonic way. Paired with a slice of layered potatoes and a light garnished green salad, this dish becomes a decadent combination of texture and balance.  One member of our party was brave enough to deviate from old-favourites and decided to try the Smoked Chicken Crepe. To put it in simple words, this crepe is a delicacy. The smoked chicken is brine cold and then hot smoked for one hour before its mixed with a mayo and pickled zucchini sauce. The chicken mix is wrapped in the crepe, that is topped with baked cheese slices (guessing Gouda) and finally garnished with a light salad. Once again, a nice combination of texture, flavour and balance.  A nice blend of chuck and short rib comprise the beef patty in this concoction. The Chef personally hand picks the meat that will be used in these burgers. The burger is served medium-rare to medium and is topped with goat cheese, a runny - tomato-style sauce - that adds a nice kick and, wait for it, a fried duck egg. Duck eggs tend to be stronger in flavour as they have more fat in the yolks and more protein in the whites. So this is a match made in heaven as the combination of the juicy punchy sauce with the egg, meat and light goat cheese, is just brilliant.  The one point I will deduct this beautiful joint is that they only offer black coffee and no tea or espresso. Though farms don't usually have espresso machines, I would say this is still city living and to me, brunch ain't complete without my cappuccino.   Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"First of all, I've been waiting try FT for years. My husband and I wanted to have a celebratory brunch and thought this was the perfect place. Brunch was fantastic! I had the \"mother and daughter\", great name btw, and it was done perfectly. The atmosphere was casual and the staff was very helpful. My husband had their burger and I have to say, it was one of the tastiest burgers we've ever had. This is the unconventional brunch place. You won't find any of the typical menu options here. Which is a great thing! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"What a great brunch!  I was impressed from start to finish.  The space is casual, comfortable and friendly.  It was busy, but we did not wait.  Coffee within seconds of sitting down, straight-forward and attentive service -  just wish more spots would get these basic right!  The menu had creative takes on exactly what you are craving at brunch. Fresh, local, thoughtful - they smoke on site.   I struggled to choose between the burger, which was recommended and the blueberry pancakes with apple and cream which I went with - they were unbelievable - loved them - my husband went with the Benny, and raved as well.  This place is refreshing.  Not contrived or hipster - it is about the food and drinks and the neighbourhood.  I saw all sorts and loved the way everyone seemed to fit in.  We will be back - and hope others reward this gem."}
{"text":"I have to say, top to bottom, the food was excellent. It is really just a shame it was tainted by the service. The staff were indecisive and aloof. Something as simple as requesting a table on the patio warranted \"maybe, maybe not\".  I sadly cannot recommend this restaurant. The classic hipster \"we are doing you a favor\" bullshit that has become all too common these days. This probably isnt the time or place but I think we are long overdue for a renaissance, when pretentiousness meant actual service.....not good food served with a side of attitude.   Oh and for good measure, when I tried to order a cappuccino they said \"we don't do that\""}
{"text":"Been here 3 times so far, including New Years Eve, twice for brunch and once for dinner.  Went the first time after reading sooooo many great reviews.  Boyfriend and I wanted to see if it lived up to the hype.  It does!  Note that I'm definitely a sucker for restaurants that have a farm-to-table philosophy.   And farmhouse does and fully embraces this theme from their mason jar glasses to kitschy country decor.  In terms of food, standouts for us have been the ploughman's platter (duck confit was incredible, we were literally fighting over the last piece) and the mother and child reunion (inspired me to go home and try to recreate the panko-crusted soft boiled egg).  The service is definitely leaning towards cool/aloof hipster vibe, but only once has it been so much so that I would describe it as snobby.  I personally love the open concept kitchen.   So much fun to watch the action!  Try to get a seat at the bar facing kitchen if you enjoy this.  Two of my favourite things about farmhouse: you text reservations.   So easy!  And F*CK Mondays - half price food and a buck a shuck??   Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"This place is so under the radar. It's your next favourite place. Seriously order anything. Or just describe the kinda things you're in the mood for. Last time I was like \"Umm fish? And some salad or veggies, you know that kinda stuff, and goat cheese.\" It was a ton of fun and the server brought one of the best glasses of white wine I've ever had (that wasn't crazy expensive). Just go try it, every time I go back I have such a great time, it's phenomenal."}
{"text":"So. OPENING NIGHT! Very cool to be there for it!  Apparently the show \"Junk Raiders\" decorated the place for one of their upcoming episodes (see here: http://bit.ly/KJXZUd), so the place is full of farmhousey knickknacks and rustic charm. None of the dishwear or china matches - it's great!  It's a small \"blackboard menu\". I posted a few pics - there were three blackboards - lists of beer, wine (red/white/sparkling, available by glass or bottle) and the daily lineup of culinary offerings.  Besides the PEI Oyster Bar (with a few different types of oysters) offering 6/$15 or 12/$29, the menu on opening night was as follows:  APPS - Summer Soup ($7) - Garden Salad ($8) - Pickled Fish ($15) - Ploughman's Platter ($23)  MAINS - Farmhouse Burger ($15) - Steak & Fries ($23) - Fish Dish ($24) - Vegetable Tart ($18)  DESSERT - Ice Cream Cones ($5) - Warm Apples ($7) - Brownie Plate ($14)  MY first couple of attempts at a drink order failed (cosmopolitan - nope - vodka/cran - nope - no cranberry juice). After a refreshing fresh-watermelon-vodka cocktail the server came up with, which was lovely, I switched to the old fave of vodka soda lime.  Speaking of service, this was the high point of the night for sure. Everyone here was brilliant. Our server was especially awesome - knew everything inside out, from the food to the wines to the area, the chef, etc. He had great ease and wonderful sense of humour. The service is spot-on and well done, laid back but with great attention to detail.  It was very cramped, but I'm going to file that as a moot point since they squeezed our reserved table for two onto the end of another set of tables where we knew people. It was also HOT in the section where we were - the one open to the kitchen - but they were definitely aware of the issue, so I'm sure it will be resolved soon - it was opening night, after all!   Our table ordered a couple of the Ploughman's Platters to share - it was a DELICIOUS array of delectable local goods, including Glengarry cheese, thick house-smoked bacon, two PEI oysters (we also ordered more separately) lavendar-herb bread baked in-house that morning, the chef's own mustard, and some sort of crazy soft-boiled egg. I tried the bread and the cheese and they were both seriously out of this world.  Mr. Rosie S. and I shared two appetizers: the soup (a rich yet refreshing and spicy/fragrant vichyssoise) and the salad. I could only handle a few spoonfuls of the soup, though I can't quite put my finger on why. I enjoyed it immensely. The salad was DELICIOUS. My mouth is watering thinking about it again! It was fresh, with local greens, onions and a wonderful shallot vinaigrette.  I (obviously) had the Veg Tart. It was surprising - light and mild in its flavours after the major tastes involved in the apps - and I loved it. The man had the burger, which came dressed in a special house sauce (mayo-type) and on a fresh sesame-seed bun - no substitutions or additions allowed! No lettuce, tomato, or other expected accoutrements on the burg. Just the meat, the sauce, and the bun. Straight up. It also came with frites, not french fries. They were wonderful. I stole many. Perfectly seasoned and not served with any dipping ketchup, mayo or other sauce. Not needed.  All of the other dishes made appearances at our table - all were enjoyed immensely and perfectly presented.  The chef came over and said hello a couple of times over the evening - love that.    They plan to be open Thursday through Sunday for dinner and weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Where to begin?  Decor is amazing, super adorable and just comfy as hell. The benches have PILLOWS on them for christ's sake!  The wait staff is ridiculously friendly, knowledgeable, conversational... I told ours I haven't had a VQA wine that I ever actually enjoyed, and he let me ramble off the wines I DO like and came back with what he thought I would enjoy. He was not wrong, and now I finally have a couple local wines I can enjoy. Fantastic.  The wife ordered the burger + fries... the burger comes with nothing on it but some lettuce and their Farmhouse Sauce which is a mix of onions and what looks to be a chipotle/mayo combo? But much lighter, not heavy at all, just delicious and what you could call a gourmet Big Mac sauce.  I got the fish dish which tonight was a pickerel and rainbow trout served with potatoes and celery in a reduced fish broth.  Hands down the best fish dish I have ever had. Seriously. I wanted to slip the waiter a $50 and get a bucket of that fish broth left out back to take home. To die for. No joke. I have a picture of it uploaded to the gallery.   To top it all off, Carl, this season's winner of Top Chef Canada, wandered into the place as we were finishing our meal. How cool is that?? OMG food geek moment.  On the pricier side and definitely hot on the kitchen side seating, if you want cooler sit on the west/right side or on the patio, but it wasn't unbearable.  I will be going back here MANY MANY MANY times."}
{"text":"Like the vibe, the décor, the people. Been trying to come here for a while, looking and looking in yelp at the pictures.  Finally made the effort to go, really like making reservations from Yelp!  So the food, burger and fries were really good. Everyone seemed to order the eggs benny, and it was good.  The décor is very rustic and country. I really like the cow in the basement, go check it out.  The craft beer list in draught was a bit light, could use some work."}
{"text":"great and unique food. Ppl working there really are really nice and quick. Once had sone crazy platter with a duck wing, crazy mustards, bacon, etc - delicious! Then had a brunch and that was great and filling too, home, unique and just a cool looking place. Toronto hipster haven! get ready to see a lot of blundstones, rolled up jeans, beards and 'Ijustdancare' shirts. :)"}
{"text":"The farmhouse chic theme is played out everywhere in this far-out Dupont joint (it pretty much fits a dictionary definition of what I like to call 'farmhouse chic'). From the rustic wood decor and kitschy knick-knacks and many of its furniture, to the chalkboard menus. And yes, even the food and drinks, in which they pride themselves in serving locally-sourced Ontario-grown grub, brews and wines. For all that young hipster foodie vibe that coats this place (including head-scratching names for some of its offerings), the atmosphere of Farmhouse actually comes off as unpretentious.  Unlike some of these other new hip restaurants popping up as of late, Farmhouse does take reservations, even by text message. There's a much larger dining room in the back that can accommodate a party. As well as an open kitchen.  I first heard of this place from a BlogTO review that mentioned something about the Brunch Burger. One read at that, and I was like, \"Holy shit, I have to eat that, NOW!\" The only thing holding me or anyone back was the price ($18). But it's hard to say no to something that is topped with goat cheese, bacon strips, and a fried duck egg that oozes all over the place. It is crazy, and it ranks amongst the best burgers I ever had.  Everything here is very pricey (even more if you are inclined to sample all the mixed drinks they make), but I guess that is the price to pay if you want to feel consciously good about consuming locally sourced food. All I care is you make damn good food.  {TTC: 26 or 40 bus to Dundas/Dupont, then walk east to Edwin on the other side of the railway underpass. You can also get here easily using the West Toronto Railpath.}"}
{"text":"While the food was delicious and I very much appreciate the local, farm-to-table aspect, the service was somewhat hostile and unwelcoming. I actually came twice last week - once on Wednesday for drinks and oysters with my friend, and again on Sunday for brunch with two different friends. Drinks on Wednesday was a bit odd - the maître d' greeting my friend and I separately and both somewhat coolly. When I arrived after, she sort of barked at me, \"you here for your friend?\" and then just pointed in the general direction of where she was sitting. We ordered 12 oysters and only received 10 and then when we asked for two more, the server didn't believe us and counted all the shells seeming a bit reluctant.  Sunday for brunch, same maître d', same sort of hostile, exasperated vibe. Our server was Australian (I can't say for sure, but he had an accent) just said \"so have you figured it out yet?\" when he first came to our table and we hadn't realized there was only a chalkboard menu. After we finished our meal, we attempted to pay our bill, with our server not offering to give us change. He also chasing after our one friend who wanted to pay by card and who was also in the bathroom, to pay for his portion. The server seemed frustrated, shaking his head at us because we were trying to split the bill, and also expressed annoyance when I accidentally ran into him as he was carrying a stool - I apologized and he rushed past me shaking his head, it was really odd.   I had been wanting to try this place for so long and it's a shame I won't be returning as the food truly was delicious. The service was so off-putting and inordinately hostile and strange, just not a pleasant experience overall."}
{"text":"Went for our valentines dinner, and we enjoyed the restaurant, though are not sure we will ever return. The main disappointment was the Ploughman's Platter - it was very different than the online pictures I saw and over half of it was pickled. What was not pickled was quite good, but there was just not enough of it. We probably should have asked prior to ordering, and we found out afterwards that it changes frequently.  The lamb dish was ok. The steak with bone marrow (which I really enjoyed) were very good. Their bread/toast is very good as well. The highlight was the Threesome appetizer - which was duck cooked in 3 different ways - it was absolutely amazing and made the trip there worthwhile. The service was good. Overall It was a good experience, but I guess we expected something better."}
{"text":"I always have their Caesar with an smoked oyster in it. At 12 dollars, it's probably one of the best in the city. Their menu always changes but the burger is one of the crowd pleasers. With a nice homemade bun and condiments, it is quite good. The fries are special cut.  I have also had the steak and other types of food - generally very well prepared.   The portions tend to be small. The price is not really $$ but more like $$$. Although the burger is good, you can get similar types burgers at 9 dollars. This is a good restaurant but definitely not a value restaurant. If you want a farm-to-table like restaurant, this definitely will be the place for you."}
{"text":"Had the threesome app, steak and frites entree and the almond cake dessert. All amazing and very well done. I was able sit right infront of the kitchen watching the chef mise en place and the line cooks do their magic, they were very friendly warming people that would take the time to explain the ingredients that were used. The servers were great help and very comforting. Very great place to take a date to! Highly recommend it! Will be coming again soon!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here finally and it was delicious! I ordered the \"Mother & Child\" - duck breast with duck egg, with a side of foie gras, and a caesar garnished with a caper berry & smoked oyseter. It was absolutely perfect. Server was friendly and knowledgeable, too. Curled up on a cozy banquette by the window was the perfect place to spend a chilly winter morning. Wouldn't bring my sister the vegan here though, the menu & decor both would be a bit too animal-heavy for her."}
{"text":"The Junction Triangle really needed this place!   Good food. Great atmosphere. Very friendly staff.  I had the farmhouse burger and the sauce was awesome. This place also makes bomb-tastic drinks. One that my friend and I love is their watermelon drink (I don't know if there's an actual name for it.) If you're not sure what you want, the staff is also able to give great suggestions.   I've only been in the bar area which has a great charm with its variety of chairs and such. In addition to the bar and dining area, they also have a patio that's great for sunny days.   I love that this place is right around the corner from me. This side of Dupont has been pretty empty and we needed something to liven it up."}
{"text":"Yummy brunch place! Came here on a Sat right around opening time and there were plenty of tables. We were a bit delayed getting in because there was some media activities going on, but they were very nice about it. We both had the bread pudding which was a nice mix of savoury and sweet. Definitely one of the best I've had (the other was at Mildred place). They didn't have cappucino so we ordered the coffee instead. Will definitely come back for their other items."}
{"text":"What took me so long to return is what I keep asking myself after visiting the place on New Year's day. I had a tasty trout dish and a butter tart for dessert. The tart was not only huge but probably one of the best tasting tarts I have had in a long time. It had a flaky crust and filling that was just the right amount of gooey."}
{"text":"Vegetarians may want to 'steer' clear of this meat heavy space. I have to say, it's my kind of spot.   Actually, the only issue if I can say that about this place is I do wish there was just a weeee bit more greens or even fruit with brunch. The sourdough bread was a nice touch but it was kind of tiny,  I will say this, the food was spot on. I had basically a meat sampler for breakfast and my friend had the deck. We were both thrilled as beans with our meals and definitely noticed the lack of non meat product.  Coffee was good but don't expect fancy coffee. It was pretty decent for a drip version so don't worry.   Everyone was awesome that worked there and the chef was pretty chill when we had asked for a substitute. Usually I get a little nervous when anyone in a party asked to tweak a recipe but he was great.  Atmosphere was great and loud but as I was told this place is always packed. So lesson one - make sure you place a reservation.  I have this place 4 but really 4.5"}
{"text":"Sweet Jesus! That's the best Caesar I've ever had! Do yourself a favour and get the smoked caesar with whatever food you get. It's got a smoked oyster perfectly wrapped in a cucumber on the rim! Top notch!"}
{"text":"Had the most fantastic celebration (2 friends turning 4-0) here last Saturday evening.  Must try dish - COTE DU BOEUF. ($100) Simply nothing like it to be found elsewhere in Toronto. What is it? Well, basically it's a giant plate of beef tenderloin pieces, cooked medium rare, topped with some greens, grilled beets and mushrooms. When I say giant, the 4 of us (all women) couldn't even eat half of the plate. The server indicated that 2-3 people could finish it, but he must have been talking about football players or some such.  We also tried the Ploughman's Platter ($24) appetizer (chartuterie plate with pork belly, some cheese and other items) and 12 oysters ($30).   Our server was absolutely fantastic, very food-knowledgeable, enthusiastic, attentive plus quite good looking to boot. The Farmhouse has an open kitchen, which we were seated near, so we had a great view of the ginger-haired executive chef and his team putting all sorts of lovely looking plates together.  Decor is kitshy, mismatched plates, chairs, etc. Cabin-y feel.   I would return solely for the Cote Du Boeuf because it can truly not be duplicated.   Total bill including a bottle of champagne, a bottle of wine, all food and generous tip came to just under $100 per person, but meals would be closer to $50 if you were choosing conscientiously."}
{"text":"Service was personalized yet discreet.  The server Richard was very efficient and informative. THE FOOD THOUGH!!!! We had the divine braised lamb.  Words can't describe  how tender and flavourful it was.  We were told they braise the lamb neck, pull it, season it, bread it and deep fry it.  Served with horseradish cream and leafy stuff.  Just amazing.  We also had the fish dish.. Rainbow trout with outstanding crispy salty skin.  Served with roasted veggies and salad plus a turnip purée from heaven.  The old an winter hip the spot and 9$ Pinot Gris tasted delightful with the fish.  Amazing experience overall. Can't wait to be back for brunch!"}
{"text":"Have since been back for dinner, had a great date night there with my man. He loved it. Amicable service, great food and warm buzzing atmosphere.   We sat at the bar by the kitchen and it was fun to watch them work. The chef even greeted us, inquired a few times as to how the food tasted and said goodbye as we left, a nice touch during a busy service. The wine recommendation was lovely as well.   Have yet to sample any desserts though, so cannot comment   New fave."}
{"text":"I love brunch... especially when I don't have to stand or wait in line. Farmhouse Tavern is one of the few restaurants that accepts online reservations for weekend brunch. Not only that, their food is quite delicious. Not every dish is terrific, but most of them are very good. Their menu changes occasionally, but standouts include the duck and eggs benedict.   Tip: I like their outdoor patio, but they also have a great private dining area in the back which can seat 8. Great for private parties!"}
{"text":"One of the best brunch experiences I've had. The food is very decadent so it's a great place to go to if you're looking to treat yourself to something. The server even went out of her way to make us iced coffee even though it's not really on the menu.   Also, the whole staff, no matter the gender, are bangin' hot!"}
{"text":"Went there for their half price dinner after 9pm on Sunday. Sampled a variety of dishes - the pork belly, braised lamb and the rib steak. All were pretty delicious and the portions were decent too. My favorite had to be the pork belly. A little out of the way in terms of getting to the restaurant but well worth the trip. They change their menu a lot apparently and I really want to try their burger so am anxious to go back."}
{"text":"Had brunch today at the Farmhouse Tavern. This restaurant has such charm, great service and the food is delicious. I ordered \" eggs in a basket with bacon\". The portion was generous and the squash was baked and smoked which paired well with the eggs/bacon. This wouldn't have been a combination that I thought of myself but I loved how all the flavours came together. If you are in the neighbourhood, this is a lovely place to stop by at!"}
{"text":"Slowly, but surely the restaurant glacier is expanding toward the Junction, where more nice restaurants are needed. Farmhouse is a respectable place on the outer fringe of the Junction. Here are a few key points....  1. Farmhouse has a bit of a Black Hoof feel. The space is relatively small with an open kitchen. There is the requisite menu on a blackboard and a small bar.  2. The food is a bit creative, but not spectacular. The trout ceviche, which was oversold, under delivered. The favors were uneven.  Bland one bite, spicy hot the next.   It was basically citrus juices and other ingredients on top of trout.  The duck appetizer was not warm, but a really good idea.  3. Other food options include lamb, a ravioli, pork belly, and a surf and turf.  There are also charcuterie plates, oysters, and cheese plates.  Most mains are 20-30$. I had a farmhouse burger.  It was good, but for 15$, no different than any backyard burger. The lettuce was pale green/white iceberg, and the bun was a typical seeded No Frills bun.  I was not asked how I wanted it cooked. It came out a nice medium rare, which was ok.  The burger plate came with a monstrous pile of fries.  4. The service is average. The staff were nice, but overextended, trying to wait on too many people at once. Interestingly, in the tight space, they did not take coats. Everyone had coats on chairs or piled beside them.    5. The cocktails were well priced and pretty good.  (The wine prices are a bit high. i noted a Niagara wine i had at home at 4 times more than i had paid.) unfortunately, there were only two \"special cocktails\" and no cocktail menu. The wine list is on one of the chalkboards.  6. The food prices are high for the over all quality and experience. An appetizer, main course, cocktail, and glass of wine could easily be 100$ after tax and tip.  Nice, but this is just not a 100$ place.  Three and a half stars."}
{"text":"Came here for a Saturday Brunch without a reservation. The restaurant is located on the corner of Dupont & Edwin Ave with plenty of parking on the side road. The place was quite busy but we got lucky and got a small table near the bar right away. The place looked small with rustic decor and mismatched furnitures and tableware, but we later noticed that they also had another room on the side (plus patio for warmer season). Menu is short and some item was already sold out for the day. It is written on a big black charlkboard on the wall. We selected the Farmhouse Brunch Burger (freshly ground meat served a little rare topped with homemade bacon, goat cheese, a fried duck egg, lettuce and a signature special sauce and fries) and the Mother And Child Reunion (duck confit leg, panko-crusted duck eggs and coleslaw). Everything tasted great except maybe for the a little soggy fries. I love that they use fresh ingredient from local farms. I have to say this is one of the best brunch we had in a while. Great find! Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"On Thursdays they have \"Buck a Shuck\": Raw oysters for 1$ each. EXCELLENT oysters, served with lemon and hot sauce. Grated horseradish and vinaigrette is only 1$ extra.   I ordered two dozen, along with two well mixed martinis and had a lovely evening, sitting at the bar. Great atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff. I look forward to their brunch!"}
{"text":"Unique, delicious food and great atmosphere! Had the Sunday night half price specials making it very affordable."}
{"text":"Intended to come here for brunch but ended up getting a reservation for 1pm (make a reservation!!) the restaurant is cozy and quaint, picture coffeehouse meets cute hunting lodge. The service is okay, but nothing to rave about.   The food is all great, everything tasted hot and fresh. You order from the board so we got the duck leg, the burger and the eggs Benedict.  - duck was good, but it was really the deep fried duck eggs that stole the show  - burger was a touch too salty but the bun and toppings were fresh and delicious and fries were hot, crispy and perfect  - eggs Bennie were perfectly runny, with a delicious biscuit bottom and a creamy hollandaise sauce  Coffee was good, but I would have liked them to refill more often, and the same with the water."}
{"text":"Bison Poutine. That is all. Incredible. Try their house-made drinks too."}
{"text":"Friendly and quick service, menu was different than your regular brunch options with foie grae and duck eggs, and the ambience was elegant yet rustic. We had the eggs Benedict with gravlax, the biscuit was tasteful but pretty hard to bite into. The eggs in a nest was delicious as well but I wished it came with more sides or content. The squash was roasted and seasoned perfectly though. The prices are more on the expensive side but I enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"The menu is on a chalkboard so the food descriptions came just from what the server told us.  We ordered a ploughman's platter and pickerel crudo to share.  The platter was a good choice to share with the table. The server said it came with meat and cheese and pickles.  It had two pieces of cheese and four small pieces of meat (don't know what kind), a little sausage, pickled cauliflower, zucchini, three kinds of mustard but not nearly enough stuff to eat it with and some toast. It also came with two duck eggs. It was nice to try. It would have been nice to know what everything on the platter was, that was not explained. I think it was $23.  As my entrée I ordered a hamburger. I was disappointed with it. I really wanted it to be great. Our server had said it was made with high quality beef. It might have been but it didn't taste like much of anything because it was so over cooked.  I was not told it came with bacon. There was one long piece of bacon that hung over the bun that was really fatty. The burger patty was small, dry, and flavourless.  I expected ordering a $20 burger for the beef to be flavourful and juicey. The meat was overcooked and bland. There is a better burger across the road at Tuck Shop Kitchen for $7 or 2km west at Jumbo Burger for $5.  The food was dropped off at our table and I wanted to ask for malt vinegar for the fries.  By the time I got their attention I had eaten half my fries and the other half was cold. There was also no pepper on the table.   The water tasted a little fishey. I wanted to ask if they got spring water from a creek. Not sure what was going on there.   I do not recommend going here unless you have lots of money and have no problem spending $20+tax+tip on a pretty unimpressive burger.  I do not recommend the burger. If you have money and want to share the platter and try some other stuff, and not be totally clear about what you're ordering you might like it was here."}
{"text":"Ohmygod. I'm just starting to accept runny eggs and I'm glad I did before I came here otherwise I would've never tried the Eggs Benny...and I'd be one sorry, stupid person because they were incredible. The portion size was great though I would've eaten 2 more if they'd been offered to me. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the blend of textures and tastes, neither which overpowered the other, was spot on. We also got mimosas which were nice and big but didn't really give off a good buzz. My fiance got the burger with a duck egg and still fantasizes about it. Can't wait til our next trip across the border!"}
{"text":"Good food with unique ambience. It was a small place with around 10 tables. The couch had the animal skin look and service was decent."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the food in this place. I was told by many people that the Farmhouse was worth a visit and they were right. I was worried it might just be an 'industry' fad, but it wasn't and I was impressed with everything.  Excellent food, descent prices and great service - what else can you ask for...?  Tried the Lamb, their burger, rib-eye steak & the ploughman's platter - all worthy of a second go..."}
{"text":"Greeted by a frowning man with arms crossed. Was this the owner?  Thankfully, the waitress was warm and smiling.   I would not recommend the eggs Benedict. While the eggs were perfectly poached, the hollandaise, overpowering in butter, was quite a distraction. For those who like potatoes, you may be left unimpressed with their cold and unseasoned small portion of scalloped potatoes. Potatoes are a cost-effective way of boosting a breakfast's overall appeal, so I'm flabbergast about why they would not put more effort into these.  Their lunch menu may be better but at 20$  I will not be risking it to find out."}
{"text":"Started my 2014 at this \"fan-tabulous\" eatery.   I googled \"New Year's Day Brunch,\" and up pops this wonderful, charming, place.   The photos alone, on the internet,  were enough to entice me to make a trip down on this chilly -18 Wednesday.    Let's start with the food.   Original, fresh, and tasty!    We ordered the following:   Mother & Child's Reunion: divine fried duck eggs & foie gras. Eggs Benny: can't go wrong with this;  and their recipe is like no other eggs benny out there in Toronto.   Thick fat piece of bacon over some sort of bread-style english muffins, topped with an amazing hollandaise sauce.   On the side, I also ordered their Sugar Stack Pancakes.  Come on, who can resist pancakes for brunch?   It was the freshest and most tastiest pancake I have ever tasted in Toronto.   (maybe a slight exaggeration, lolz).   The sweetness wasn't over the top, fresh blueberries, and creme, makes this dish a winner.  Tasted like they made everything from scratch.   (I'm sure it is).  The only complaint I have about this place is not about the food, but the atmosphere.  We sat near the door and it was a bit drafty all throughout our meal.   We immediately forgot about the cold draft with free coffee refills and our delicious warm hearty meals.   But still, I think I would save this place for Spring or Summer time, because I have a phobia of the cold.    Other than that,  great food and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to go here for a longtime, and before I became an east ender, but finally made it here before touring the junction for furniture.  Surprisingly when we got there around 1130 there was a table waiting for us inside for 4. And still plenty of room on the patio, though it seemed to fill up quite quickly later on.  The inside is quaint and warm and comfy, like a farmhouse. The coffee mugs don't match and come from here and there... Its cute and makes it homey.  Now the important part. The food. Delicious brunch. The Eggs Benny is up there with the Benny at Emma's country kitchen. I got them with gravlax but they also have a veg option with kale. The hollandaise was excellent and thick not watery. I tried the buttermilk pancakes and apples and they were amazing. Thick and fluffy, sweet and cinnamony. I tried some of the mother and child reunion. The deep fried duck egg was dope. The prices here definitely reflect the quality of the food and ingredients, and a decent meal in the city."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food. What more is there to ask for?  Ordered the I heart beef with foie gras. Every bite was orgasmic. Loved the slaw and beef was cooked to my request."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the staff is amazing!  I love this place.  I've taken friends and family here and everyone has loved it so far."}
{"text":"Came here today for a birthday brunch.  Loved that the restaurant takes reservations for Sunday brunch.  Casual and friendly ambiance.    I ordered the Barnyard Burger which is prepared with a fried duck egg, goat cheese, lettuce, bacon.   Tasty and rich.  The duck egg definitely makes the burger...just don't order it on a (first) date as it is pretty messy to eat; I went through several napkins.  The fries were also good.    Service was great and very friendly. They asked if we preferred one bill or separate bills and didn't rush our party of 6 once we were done.  For a popular brunch spot, I was surprised they only served regular coffee; they do not offer specialty coffees, like lattes and cafe au lait.  Nonetheless, I would definitely return for brunch and would come back to try dinner."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, and the restaurant itself is gorgeous, but the service was slow and the portions were TINY."}
{"text":"Just before you enter it hits you - the beautiful smell of smoking meat.  Luring you in, you enter a mismatched barned license plated world. Almost like APDC's sugar shack slept with a farm girl and had a kid who moved to the city and refused to be a hipster. You immediately think - i want their effing t-shirts.   Simplicity - the food is cooked with finesse and boasts its own quality of produce. Equally reflected in the service. Servers who seem so down to earth yet have so much knowledge. Presentation makes you smile. Food that makes you love."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the BEST brunch I've ever had! I arrived close to 3 pm on a Sunday afternoon. The place was packed but we didn't have to wait long before a table freed up.   The staff gave a speedy explanation of their chalkboard menu. I ordered eggs benedict with bacon ($15) and my friend ordered the country breakfast ($15). My eggs benedict was so so delicious! The poached egg was cooked to perfection and they served two thick slices of fatty bacon. The muffin had a beautiful aroma of butter and an extremely crispy bottom. As for the country breakfast, the sausage complimented well with the mustard on the side, the scrambled eggs had a nice touch of dill and again, the bacon was very tasty- with a good ratio of meat and fat and not to mention, it was maple glazed. The thick cut terrine had a subtle, almost bland taste to it and so we paired it with the pear paste. It was fun exploring their choices/pairing of sauces and dish.   I would say that their brunch is on the pricier end of the scale with choices starting at around $15 but seeing that I had a great experience here, I am looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"If you like pastries or croissants get the Eggs Benny. Those cheddar biscuits slay me. #rip   Wait time was a bit long. But the great service and food made up for it."}
{"text":"meh. seriously just meh. the menu rotates based on available ingredients, which I appreciate however it's a pretty boring menu. Usually 1 fish, a burger, some sort of pasta. Not vegetarian friendly. Charcuterie board was really overpriced and mediocre. I've been here a few times for dinner and once for brunch. The staff has been attentive at times and completely awful at others. Like other people mention, they do the farm to table, foraging for greens thing.... but the execution is just meh. Save your money and go next door!"}
{"text":"I would rate this brunch place 3.5 out of 5 stars. The food was good - I ordered the Eggs Benny with Bacon and there was an arugula salad on the side. But it wasn't that impressive! Considering the travel to get to the Junction, I wouldn't revisit."}
{"text":"One of the best brunches in the city (and also great for dinner of course).   The ploughman's platter is always a hit especially with a group. Love the local and fresh produce - the concept for the restaurant is one that I will continue to support for as long as they're doors are open to me.   The staff are great and accommodating, the food is fantastic, and the atmosphere is both parts welcoming and chic."}
{"text":"A group of us gathered here for brunch the other day. We all loved our meals and I especially enjoyed the Smokey Caesar. Great portion sizes and lots of flavours. The staff was really friendly and overall it was a highly enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"This was delicious!!!! We were visiting from out of town and were dying for a good Sunday brunch spot... We found it!!!! Their menu is short but sweet. It all was so good! Most of us got their eggs benedict but one member in our party got their burger with a fried egg! I can't put into words how yummy everything was and it was all so different then what we expected flavor wise. The only thing I would say is they are very stingy with their bacon.... Even if you order it on the side it is 2 very small pieces and I barely tasted it on the benedict. However, this is a must try if you are in Toronto. If you can make a reservation."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and drinks. I had been craving a caeser all day. I was so disappointed to hear that they only make ceasers during brunch... What!! Why?? After taking a look at the menu for 10 minutes and having the server describe most meals, there wasn't one dish anyone at my table wanted ... Some were craving pasta and the pasta dish of the night was rabbit in a duck sauce... Just a little too adventurous for some of us I guess... I opted for the burger. When it got to me it wasn't fully cooked but instead medium rare inside. I get that a lot of restaurants will serve burgers like this nowadays, but it would have been nice if our server had asked us how we wanted the burgers cooked if they weren't going to fully cook the meat. It also was served with a runny duck egg on top. I would have preferred the burger without the egg. My friend ordered the trout and said it was just okay. The food is expensive and it isn't for those who are in the mood for something a little less fancy.  The pros of this place are the decor inside and the service. I will be back for brunch at some point. Hopefully I will get to satisfy my caeser craving then."}
{"text":"I've been super interested in trying this place since it closed as June Harlowe and re-opened as Farmhouse Tavern.  Stopped in on a Friday night, was a bit worried that there wouldn't be available tables since we didn't have a reservation.  The patio was full but plenty of seating in the cozy dining room.  We grabbed a table close to the window and big fan.  First noticed the delightful homey decor - mismatched water glasses that reminded us of childhood, comfy pillows lining the bench, kitschy nick knacks, etc.  Menus were up on chalkboards.  Perused the extensive wine list - DC went with a white wine ($11)  that our server recommended.  I got a glass of the watermelon lemonade ($4), usually reserved for brunches.  We started with the Fat Peach Salad ($9) to share - bitter greens and kale mixed with nuts, goat cheese and hunks of ripe Ontario peaches.  Mains - we both ordered the fish of the day - rainbow trout ($20).  Mine was battered - hers was grilled with no batter due to a glutton allergy.  Fish came on a puree bed of asparagus, I think, and a side of crispy pickled string beans and beets.  The lemonade turned out to be the perfect accompaniment to the fish!  Ended the meal with a scoop of cool strawberry ice cream ($4) as we were both pretty stuffed.  Had a fantastic meal and a great time catching up.  Will definitely be back for brunch and to enjoy the patio.  Farmhouse Tavern is a welcomed addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Bring your wallet. But that's par for the course in TO.  I just moved back from Brooklyn and of course I've been a bit spoiled food wise.  So far I've been vastly underwhelmed by Toronto fare but this place is a very pleasant surprise. I would put this next to (and above) any brunch spot in NYC.  Could use more space, but when it comes to brunch there's never enough space."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch. Got a mention in Now magazine as restaurant to look out for.  Menu is 4 items. But place is packed. I had the Mother and Child reunion. Very nice. However, when serving eggs, have toast. Cmon man."}
{"text":"Love love love that this place takes brunch resos. It is always rammed from opening even with a reso so be prepared for a wait for your food. Food was well worth it though. Great coffee, no decaf or tea if you care (was dining with a preggo friend). On that note, reserved high chair and that seemed to be a problem upon  arrival. That coupled with the wait maybe not ideal for families but we managed and the fare was well worth it. Crazy good pancakes and eggs benny with truffles? Yep."}
{"text":"BF and I picked Farmhouse Tavern having heard great things about the food, and because anywhere that has some $100 monstrous dish of beef mentioned in the reviews seems like an interesting spot.  We come in a bit early from our reserved time, but that's no problem and we are seated right away. The kitchen is an open kitchen, and I did notice that the lighting from the kitchen is not very flattering - it's the kind of bright office lighting that's a bit too harsh for ambiance.   The seating is a combination of mismatched old-fashioned wooden chairs and long booth seating with cool cushions. The menu is displayed on chalkboard, so we spend a bit of time gazing, picking, squinting, choosing, etc. I'm not a big fan of the entrees being on the chalkboard like that - they're 2 words, like \"Beef Sirloin\" or \"Braised Lamb\", and says nothing of the flavour.  Our server, Richard, is a hearty guy - jokes about why it took us so long to give them a try! He makes some recommendations and we end up ordering the Ploughman's Platter ($23), Bone Marrow ($11) and Braised Lamb ($23), For drinks, BF got a local brew called Beau __________ (pretty good!) and I chose a red Cab.   The Platter was interesting - there's pickled veggies, cheeses, toasted bread, smoked salmon and a big roasted duck leg. All in all delicious, especially the duck leg, but it seemed a little mixed up - I suppose they have their own interpretation of \"charcuterie\", but there were no cured meats, and the salmon was a surprise. The Bone Marrow was good - one big bone, lots of marrow to go around, topped with tomatoes and seasoning. Last, the braised lamb was a BIG surprise. We pictured a lambshank, braised on some veggies, or rice, or something. It's like a crabcake - braised lamb on the inside, then coated and fried. Sitting on a bed of celery pureed sauce. Tasted good and I liked it, but BF was a little dubious.  Overall, service was good - Richard came back frequently to check on us, see if we liked the food. With the Yelp check-in, you also get 1 free refill of your alcoholic drink. I didn't like my red wine too much, but Richard graciously offered to refill it with something more to my taste.  Great meal, and Yelpers, remember to check in!"}
{"text":"I've lived near this place for a few years and finally went here for brunch! The interior is very rustic and farm-like. The food was just really fresh.  Only thing is that they do not have AC in the summer and summer was extremely hot!  Other than that their food is great and I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Tip: get here early if you like oysters :). Came here at 9 and they were sold out  Really liked the bone marrow and venison and duck."}
{"text":"Exceptional service  Delicious food ( We had Farmhouse burger with duck eggs and rib eye steak ) don't forget to try the foie gras - but  be prepared to pay premium price. However, it is all local farm based foods .   Atmosphere cozy and warm  as long as you dont sit next to the entrance.  If you are looking for a real meal and something different in the city, you should visit Farmhouse."}
{"text":"Yelp Gods forgive me for I have sinned... I could have sworn I had Yelped about this place months ago, but clearly I was mistaken. Farmhouse is fantastic. Anyone who tells you otherwise has likely been attacked by a mob of brain sucking zombies and is unable to distinguish incredible food from something bought off a $1.99 value menu. Opening a review with this much hype is always a bit risky but honestly I am willing to put my Yelp reputation on it. In the last year I've been to this place enough times to consider myself a groupie and that's ok by me!  First off let's talk about the location. The Junction triangle is a non-gentrified, un-loved and under appreciated neighbourhood...incedently it's also my hood. I must admit that when Farmhouse first came on the scene I was nervous about getting attached to such a great place in case that corner lot at Dupont and Franklin was cursed (made evident by the revolving door of business that used to occupy this same space).   At first my impressions of Farmhouse were lukewarm; the menu was still being figured out and lacked variety and the prices seemed high but man could they ever make a cocktail! Since then Farmhouse was been tickled by the talents of Chef Alex Molitz... a man who's love of coffee may actually surpass mine (with a Cafe Con Leche habit to match).   I find that the food produced now has more heart, the menu more variety and the service is great. The burger is my favourite thing on the menu and I generally hate burgers... something about pork belly, goat cheese and a duck egg served on a medium rare hunk of ground beef makes my mouth water. The bun is simple and the lettuce used is iceberg which is an odd choice but works (crunchy to soft ratio intact). Other fantastic items on the menu include the sunchoke ravioli, the \"threesome\", the gnocchi and of course the poutine which is technically my favourite item when it's available topped with beef cheek. On the drink front you have have lots of strong and tasty options, especially if you like bitters. I would suggest their marvellous spin on rum and coke: Screech and homemade cola.   I would highly recommend making reservations for dinner as the dining room isn't very large and the bar area doesn't more than 20."}
{"text":"Went here for a second time and I think they make good food but I have some issues that will prevent my return.  Firstly the wine list really sucks. They take this local theme a little too far and apply it to wines.  There is just a bunch of wines from prince Edward county and niagara.  This is okay for whites but does not even come close to satisfactory for reds. If you order one of the steaks on the menu you cannot get a full bodied red to accompany.  And the wines were over priced. Typically $17 or $18 for a glass and bottles were also high.   And no, good full bodied reds from Ontario do not exist.   So they really need to up their game on the wine as this is an important part of a meal.   Secondly they had only one desert which was a raisin cake. So clearly they don't want you lingering after your mean for dessert and coffee.   Lastly, the menu is very small. Only a handful of dishes to choose from.   Don't get me wrong, I like the food but there are a lot of options in the area with a more robust offerings.  I hope they read this and make some changes as it could be a very good restaurant."}
{"text":"Maybe I came here with high expectation after reading all these 4/5 star Yelp reviews. Or Maybe because I was here for brunch instead of a full dinner experience?  Farmhouse Tavern was A-OK but not memorable. Definitely not somewhere I would make a special trip back unless I am in the area. But there are other options in the area?  I do love the set up and the casual vibe of this place. Wait staff is nice and friendly! Love the mismatch everything and the barn like feel.  We shared:  BLT ($14) Mother and Child Reunion ($15) - Poached, fried duck eggs with duck prosciutto The duck eggs was well prepared with the yolk still oozing out!   The local sourced ingredients definitely fresh!  Cote Du Boeuf for $120? or Maybe some Foie Gras? And of course some crafted beer? That might be a total different experience!"}
{"text":"...\"Craning our necks to see the chalkboard, I quickly decided on the veggie stack ($17), which was a grilled pile of Portobello mushrooms, eggplant and zucchini served sans bun with fries. My date opted for the Barnyard Burger ($21), which was a traditional burger with a sunny-side up duck egg and bacon. Our orders both looked better than they tasted. My grilled veggies were lifeless and charred. And the accompanying tomato sauce was tepid and flavourless. It reminded me of Heinz's tomato paste that had been smeared on top. From the first bite, it was obvious that the veggies had been pre-cooked and zapped. The hand cut fries, which had huge potential, were under salted and the portion was stingy. And the bite of burger that I tried was better, but not by much. I'm not sure what the hype was about...\""}
{"text":"Smaller menu  for brunch but perhaps you don't want to have to choose from 30 diff options as well.  Had the egg in. Nest with bacon which was a poached egg nestled in roasted butter nut squash....the bacon made this over the top yum."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, good selection of VQA Ontario wines and friendly service. Had oysters, boar and fish and enjoyed every dish, looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"The service was very friendly, Amanda, our waitress was a sweet heart.  The restaurant itself is a nice casual atmosphere.  My boyfriend and I had high expectations for the food and restaurant.  To start off, for Saturday's and Sunday's on their site they note they are open all day.  We arrived at 5:30PM and not everything was available.  We were not impressed with the owner as he was super cocky and bragged about how he had fired the chef who had been known for their top dish in Toronto, and he had take the signature dish with him. (This dish is one of the reason's we came all the way to Farmhouse Tavern from downtown)   I was a bit disappointed with the fact that some of the items being overpriced for being local items.  Onto the food:  1. Oysters:  They were okay, nothing special.  2. Fancy salad:  Be sure that you like root vegetables when ordering this salad.  I do not care for root veggies, but my boyfriend does not mind.  He said the salad was okay.  The presentation was very pretty.  3. Fish Dish:  I have a local grouper, the presentation was very good.  The fish was delicious.  The sides were perfect as well.  Celery root puree.  4.  Pork Belly:  My boyfriend had the pork belly, his opinion following.  The actual piece of pork belly could have been 1/2 the size as it is a rich piece of meat.  He really enjoyed the smoked butternut squash puree.  Overall this dish was not worth the $35.  5.  Desert:  We shared the Goat Cheese Ice Cream with candied root vegetables.  This was okay, as I am not an ice cream lover, but do love goat cheese, this was okay.  Our overall experience was not a terrible experience.  I do not believe I would take public transport all the way there again.  This place has a lot of potential as it is a very warm feeling restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here over a year ago through our friend's recommendation and had a great experience with the food and service.   Came back last night to take our out of town guests, and the experience could not be more different. The service was terrible, our plates took over 1.5hrs after ordering (the server had mentioned it was because another table ordered before us, which is why our plates were behind. Alright...), once the plates arrived:  Ploughmans platter: This was okay, our server couldn't remember what was on our board so she couldn't tell us what we were eating, which was a bit disenchanting:  \"and this is the.. well. I don't know what that is. Will get you an answer and come back\" Never came back.  Butternut squash Gnocchi: Bland, very bland. This was so disappointing it hurts. We asked for s&p to make it taste like something.  Rainbow trout dish: Good  Vegetable harvest: Meh  Their serving portions drastically changed for dinner service. What happened!!???!! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Spoke to our friends who originally recommended us a year ago and they too, had mentioned their recent experience being disappointing."}
{"text":"Great little spot in the junction. We came after 10 so it was too late to sample their food, but the scene on a Sunday night was lively, and the outdoor seating is always appreciated. Check into yelp for a free refill of your pint. Friendly server, great location. Will have to come back to try their food!"}
{"text":"In the Junction, the trouble I'm finding is that good food is extremely overpriced - this is one of those places.    This is probably the best restaurant to go to for a large group for dinner.  But, it is a little out of the way on transit, and you have to get through that crazy Dupont/Annette/Dundas cluster cuss to get there.  Food - good but not worth the amount you are paying - I got the Fish Dish.  The trout was done nicely, with some roasted barley (?) on top and some braised rainbow kale underneath in a sour sauce.  Beverages are crazy expensive, and wait staff a little bit slow/hoity toity for no good reason.  Menu is on a chalkboard - which they could have spent more time identifying what was an appetizer and what was a main.    Kind of meh - not good, not bad, will have to try it for lunch.  Reservations are by text, feel like their website could be slightly more helpful."}
{"text":"First of all, it's extremely hard to get there.  Horrible ghetto neighborhood with tons of pot holes that will eventually ruin your tires.   Parking? Almost impossible.    We ordered hey buttercup and mother and child reunion.   Here are things I didn't like: 1. People in my aisle, at least one person ordered hey buttercup. Though chef used different presentation to make it \"unique\" he should really keep up with the quantity lol. Everyone got different portion! Wtf?  2. Mother and child reunion- which reiterate my point for #1. When I went to check in yelp, I saw substantial large size of slices. Just look at how tiny my slices of duck was!!!!!!!!! So tiny so frivolous 4 pieces- it's insulting to pay 13$ for that."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat for brunch. I was skeptical but was proven wrong! This place is of quality. The only thing is you need to be prepared to dish out the cash as it's on the pricier side than most brunch places. But you definitely get what you pay for. Good atmosphere, excellent service, kind and accommodating staff, plus yummy dishes and wonderful cocktails! Their caesar is ace! You get a smoked oyster wrapped in a sheet of cucumber. I checked in using Yelp and got a free refill of my caesar! Go and get one for yourself (or two if you check in!)."}
{"text":"This post was way overdue, we went to Farmhouse Tavern (@FARMHOUSEtavern) back in April and it was amazing with huge portion... so huge that we end up packing some leftover home which is a first for us.  I tried quite a few times to get a reservation.... so make sure to make your reservation, do not drop-by, they take reservation via test which is very convenient (no unanswered phone). Arriving on a Sunday at 6:30, the place was already packed and buzzing.  We were seated on the side of the restaurant with the open kitchen and it does get quite hot given it's only April, can't imagine when it's summer. But love the darker lighting here so that the bright open kitchen take center stage.   Love the decor throughout the restaurant with a vintage stove as shelf and the barn door mounted on the wall to slide around the blackboard menu (easy change from day to night menu)   Pretty simple menu, yet I wish to order everything and had a tough time ordering =P They don't really have paper menu and with the minimal descriptions of each dish, we basically have to ask our server what's what.  Love their wine list here with all local Ontario wine #golocal  \"The Conspiracy\" Cabernet Sauvignon 2011, Foreign Affair - $50 Very rich to the palate with very approachable tannins which goes perfectly with all our dishes  Mushroom Soup $9 ~ The broth came in a teapot and was pour on top of the mushroom at the table. ~ The smell was mesmerizing, smelling one from the table next to us was the reason we ordered this (^_^) ~ Very simple and basic with the mushroom woody flavor being the star of the dish.  ~ It was warm and satisfying.   Ploughman's Platter $25 ~ This was such a huge portion w/ the duck confit and the huge slab of pork belly, this alone fill up both of us.  ~ Love everything here including the smoke salmon, the cheeses, egg, the pickled and even the bread. ~ If it's just for 2 people, I would suggest to order another small app and enjoy this with a bottle of wine and it'll be more than enough.  Braised Lamb $23 ~ Since the name didn't they us much, our server proceed to explaining to us what this dish was.  ~ Basically the lamb was braised for hours until tender and shredded, then packed into a baking tray... cut and coated with breadcrumbs and fried. Hope I got all this correct =P ~ But it was worth all those work since the inside was moist and tender while the crust was super crunchy.  ~ Also love the pick beet puree and love how they served the roasted beets with the roots still on, sort of rustic. Didn't know you can eat that but since it was served that way, I guess you could.   Pork Belly $29 ~ Isn't this just a beauty with the layers of skin, fat and meat!!  ~! Just melt in your mouth good with a crispy skin and the apples just lighten and brighten it up.    Goat Cheese Ice Cream w/ Candied Root Veg $6 ~ Never had ice cream with veggies before and it's goat cheese ice cream.  ~ It was not as sweet as your normal ice cream but it had more of a crumbly texture but somehow I like it with the candied veg.   We packed half of each of our main home, the Ploughman's Platter had us there.   Verdict : ~ Love this place   ~! Would love to come back with friends to try more dishes and def to share that platter ~ I already came back for Brunch for Canada Day and it was just as delicious (post coming)"}
{"text":"In my ongoing search for fantastic brunch spots, the Farmhouse currently sits on top.    Not shockingly, the decor is themed around the name and is relaxed and cozy (note that the kitchen is open to the seating which makes it quite warm so avoid thick sweaters).  It is a bit oddly separated into two dinning areas but it makes the restaurant feel more hospitable.  I don't agree with other comments about the tables being to crowded.  I'm 6'1\" and had no issues even after an extra chair was added for our group.  The burger is confluence of about 7 meals layered on top of each other and is, I am nearly certain, impossible to get into your mouth. The amount of goats cheese on it alone is a meal.  It would seem an odd choice for brunch but it works.  The eggs Benedict, however,  is my favourite.  Served on a hard biscuit rather than an english muffin, it is sublime.  I have never found one better.  The Hollandaise sauce is perfect - I had no idea I could like Hollandaise sauce that much.  The hangover poutine is also amazing although it is to share.  Any one person would have a nearly impossible time finishing it.    We were lucky and got in without reservations but clearly it is a much better idea to go with a spot reserved.  I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Visitor for a few days and decided I needed to try this place.  It was past 9pm so they had special pricing on food (AWESOME).  I ordered the A Threesome which is the  prosciutto,  foie torchon and grilled foie on this delicious buttery bread.  The service was amazing and the guys (and gal I met) who were working helped me through the chalk board menu.  Was extremely delicious and while I know foie is not by any means something to eat everyday, man it was good. I traveled across town just for this place on my visit and I am glad I did!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food, and very cool environment.  A hidden beauty!"}
{"text":"Depending on how adventurous you are with your food, this restaurant could provide either the most interesting or the most terrifying dining experience of your life.  We were there for brunch on Saturday, menu was quite small, around 8 choices to choose from. Given the small menu size, you would expect the food to be great given the specialty. When the food came, they did look quite appetizing, but portions were on the small side given the prices were all above $10. We ordered the mother + child reunion, strawberry pancakes, and eggs benny.   Mother + child reunion: this was a rather fun item. It's basically a duck egg wrapped with some kind of meat, and the whole thing is crusted and fried. The meat layer was rather thin, and as we were eating, our friend found a piece of white feather on it that looked like those dandelion flakes. We asked the server if that's a piece of feather, she said it's some remnants of beef fat (???) Not quite sure what she means, and not quite sure what animal the \"mother\" of the dish is referring to, if there is some \"beef fat\" in the meat layer.   Strawberry pancakes: Just your regular pancakes that's about the same as what you can get at Eggsmart at half the price.   Eggs benny: there were 3 choices for the eggs benny, kale, bacon and gravlax. Looked good on arrival. But eggs were almost completely cooked through, no oozing out at all. Toast underneath the egg was so hard that it flew off the plate as we cut into it. Bacon - can't comment on that because no one could find it. There was also a salad on the side, and this was where the fun began. Half way into eating, my friend noticed there was something that looked like sea cucumbers in the salad. Curious to see what it was, she poked this grey creature with her fork, lo and behold, it was alive and moving! Right, there was a live worm (about the size of your pinky) in the salad. Our server insisted that the veggies were washed, and she would waive that dish from our bill. At that point, my friends lost their appetite and the server wasn't pleased with the drama we created in the restaurant, she started collecting ALL of the plates on our table without asking even though I was still eating.  IN SUMMARY, if there was anything that impressed us at all, it would be how terrible everything was about this restaurant."}
