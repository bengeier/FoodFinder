{"text":"After reading John Gilchrist's review of La Casa Latina my husband and I were excited to try what sounded like some authentic Mexican/Latin food. Having relocated to Calgary from California we consider ourselves pretty good judges of this type of food.   I ordered the Columbia fish, my husband ordered the Columbian paisa, a steak with many accompaniments such as chorizo and chicharrons.  My fish was cooked perfectly and my husband's steak platter was a fun array of assorted goodies, everything fresh and done well.   The Menjivars were gracious hosts and their young staff took good care of us. We agreed that last night at La Casa Latina we had one of the best meal experiences we have had in Calgary! We will be going back to try other menu items as soon as we can.  Next time we'll try the Mexican side of the menu and I will let you know if it stands up to the amazing Latin dishes we had last night!"}
{"text":"We were on vacation from Toronto and ate here our last night... We ordered the nachos and the molcajete con pollo (chicken breast stone bowl).   Visually: Restaurant seemed a bit dark and the furniture could use some updating.   Ambiance: Nothing too romantic or lively the night we were in but seemed perfect for families or larger groups to come together.   Service: Our server was the owners son in law and he was very attentive and welcoming. His hospitality made our dinner that much better as he took the time out to tell us a little about the food and the special stone serving dish in the shape of a bull!   Food: Very good, very big portions... Like huge... So I hope you're hungry. Taste was great with fresh ingredients. The nachos were gigantic and there were ingredients throughout the entire thing (not just on the top). The sauce of the molcajete was quite delicious and complimented the chicken and veggies so nicely and it came with warm tortillas, rice, and beans!!!   Overall rating is a 4 stars for us... A renovated interior would have got a 5!  We would return if we lived here... There's definitely no place in Toronto that we've been to that serves molcajete!! Perfect for sharing among friends and family."}
{"text":"Chicken Enchilada with beans and rice. Shredded chicken inside corn tortilla. Best beans I've had in a long time. Tamarind soda also very good. I need to go back and try the Chili Rellenos."}
{"text":"I moved to Calgary from Houston, where there's a great Mexican restaurant on practically every corner. I'd yet to find anything even remotely authentic in Calgary and I was starting to get homesick. A burrito with tomato-basil sauce? \"Mexican poutine?\" Oh, Calgary. Please. Then La Casa opened. I held my breath, trying not to get my hopes up. (ahem) Calgary, you finally have authentic Mexican/Central American food. And it's not just authentic, it's GOOD.  The chicken enchiladas are good, the molcajete is superb (and where else are you going to get this, anyway?) and the margaritas are top-notch.  But I gotta talk about the fajitas. I almost didn't get them because I'm used to living in the land of Very Good Fajitas and I didn't want to find something on the menu that wasn't as good as I hoped. After multiple visits, however, I took the plunge. The steak fajitas are every bit as good as any I've had... but the chicken fajitas are easily the BEST chicken fajitas I've ever found. Ever. I have no idea how they cook the chicken, but it's smoky, flavorful, and incredibly moist. The onions and peppers are cooked through but still have a bit of crunch and as a bonus, there are grilled mango strips mixed in as well. What a great idea!  In ten or so visits, the only dish I've ever ordered that wasn't instagram-worthy was the chicken milanesa...which was good, but not amazing.  But hey, it's the one non-latin thing on the menu. Stick with the cuisine you came for in the first place and you'll never be disappointed.  The staff is super-friendly and attentive and helpful for newbies to this kind of food. I've taken lots of friends here who \"don't like Mexican food\" and they've all left finally understanding what I've been telling them all along: that they only thought they don't like Mexican food because all the Mexican food they've had in Calgary was... well, not *real* Mexican food. This is. Mexican, El Salvadoran, and a few other recipes all worth trying.  Oh, and bring your own bottle of wine to wash down your margaritas. The corkage fee is quite reasonable and they're happy to oblige. BONUS: it's one of the few places left in the city that's quiet enough to have a conversation without screaming."}
{"text":"Drove by this place months ago, finally gave it a try. Tried the fajitas ($19.50), and they were the best fajitas I've had in this city in years. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Every time we are down on International Ave, the Boy is constantly talking about this delicious Latin place he went and how he cant remember where it is. Turns out it is because they moved.  A friend took us to La Casa Latina the other week, and instantly the Boy's eyes lit up with recognition and hunger. Knew I was in for a treat.  I have heard they do amazing Mexican food and everything coming out to the kitchen looked super tasty. But we wanted our Latin flavour fix, so will have to come back next time and try as many items as possible.  I had the TIPICO # 2 - Charbroiled steak with your choice of beans (re-fried or charro), rice, chorizo, cheese & pico de gallo. Both of the guys had TIPICO #3 - Charbroiled steak with your choice of beans (re-fried or charro), rice, chorizo, cheese and fried plantain. Main difference being the fried plantain.  The charbroiled steak on all was a little tougher - but not chewy. Steaks had great seasoning and weren't dry. Re-fried beans were amazing. Really think you can judge a place on the quality of their beans. Cheese that came with it was like a hard less salty type of feta - never had it before and loved it.   But the clear winner was the chorizo. I don't think a portion of 2 whole sausages would have been enough to satisfy. Great seasoning, right amount of spice. All made in-house too. You can tell.  Far to full to even think about dessert, but there will either be space next time, or we will take it home for later.  Seems like they have a good following with lots of regulars coming in. I can see why, and one of those regulars will soon be me."}
{"text":"The meal lacked attention to detail, but at the end of the day was quite delicious.   We started with the patacones con queso and the empanadas. I have only had fried plantains a couple of times in Miami so I don't have a large point of reference but these tasted similiar. I just don't think I will ever be a huge fried plantain fan, but it is no reflection on the way that they were prepared. The first batch of empanadas that we received were ice cold in the middle so they were sent back and were replaced in fairly short order with piping hot ones. My husband has eaten empanadas in several South American countries and had never had them prepared this way- with a deep-fried cornmeal type crust. They were tasty though.  For our mains, we both ordered a chicken burrito with the verde sauce. When our dishes arrived, my plate was missing the sour cream and my husband's had red sauce instead of the green as requested and no cheese on the beans.  The no cheese on the beans was easy to let go but the wrong sauce was a deal-breaker so for the second time food had to be sent back to the kitchen. We both ordered the same thing, I would not have thought it too difficult to make two identical plates!   The salvation for the meal was that the burrito was so damn delicious. We lived in CA for over 20 years and have had MANY burritos and this stacks up to the best of them. They also graciously removed the empanadas from our bill so they really tried to make everything right.   The decor and the music is nice, the servers were friendly and efficient, there are 4-5 free parking spots in front of the restaurant and the food once properly received is really delicious so we will be return visitors."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Finally we found a great Mexican place in Calgary. We have tried several, but all were underwhelming. this place is it!! We were surprised it was not more full on a Friday night. The margaritas were spot on. We had the jalapeno rellenos as appetizers. Great combination of cheesiness and spiciness. As the main course, we had the Chicken Molcajete. This was a unique dish, which we have not had in any other Mexican restaurant. It was just spectacularly good. To add to all the good food, the service was great, and the place is nice as well. This will surely be our go-to Mexican place!"}
{"text":"Very nice meal. We had a chicken molcajete bowl which was good, but the paella was really good! Will go again."}
{"text":"Michelada deliciosa!  Pollo fajita muy rico  Carne muy sabrosa!   Pero.... les falta hacer salsas ricas.  De ah√≠ en fuera todo muy rico!"}
{"text":"I have been to La Casa Latina several times, this place is consistent ! Great heart warming food, with friendly family run service."}
{"text":"Wow!  Why wasn't this place packed?!  Everything was fresh and tasty!  We ordered a bunch of dishes and all shared. Everyone was stunned by the end of the meal.   Loved the grilled steak from the stone bowl, nachos were authentic, platter was excellent. Paella had a variety of seafood. Would definitely recommend!!  Excellent service and I loved the music."}
{"text":"My family is visiting from the states. We were looking for a great Mexican restaurant and well look no further! Don't let the outside fool you the inside is super nice and clean! Very nice decor and clean bathrooms. The food was amazing super fresh and delicious! The service here was great too! Really friendly and personable. Looking forward to coming back here next year when we do our annual trip up to Alberta"}
{"text":"This restaurant is really nice, great location to. The owners who run the place are friendly I'm quick to suggest meals based on your mood and your experience with their cuisine. It's a nice mixture of Mexican food and Chilean, and I have frequented this place on a number of occasions for lunch, and dinner.  I highly recommend the enchiladas, although the paella is also a win."}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Will be back definitely. Steaks are fantastic, salsa was delicious, empanadas -juicy and full of flavour."}
