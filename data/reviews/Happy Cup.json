{"text":"Was craving bubble tea in a major way. Didn't feel like driving to the north so we googled and found this gem. Fresh bubble tea and smoothies with real fruit. Fair prices. 

Had a fresh avocado BT with pearls and it was perfect. 
 
Best bubble tea in SW quadrant for sure!"}
{"text":"Happy cup is such an awesome little place, reminds me of Vancouver with its foosball table and games. The bubble tea is always made with care! 
We enjoy our bubble tea and have traveled to get it, this place is definitely top quality! Vancouver has many tea houses I'm almost ready to say this is better than over 90% of them!"}
{"text":"I love Happy Cup! Delicious, healthy smoothies! The customer service is excellent. The owners are friendly, kind, humble and friendly. My kids enjoy playing foosball, Jenja, chess, and UNO. A cute, clean, fresh cafe with delicious smoothies."}
{"text":"I love Happy Cup.

How much do I love it? Well, let's just say I try to convince my wife to stop by every time we drive past. Considering that's just about every day (it's conveniently located by the Safeway in Woodbine), it's amazing I'm not broke yet. Their menu is pretty big, and everything is made with fresh fruit right in front of you. I love bubble tea, so I always add the pearls, but my wife likes their smoothies without anything added. My favourites are the taro slush, green tea milk tea, and the pina colada smoothie. The service here is excellent as well - I am always greeted with a smile of recognition, and every recommendation I've received has been spot on. The decor is inviting, and there's even a Foosball table! If you haven't been yet, you should definitely go. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great bubble tea cafe in SW Calgary! Menu includes a wide selection of fresh and powdered fruit smoothies. I wholly recommend the fresh kiwi: tart and full of real kiwi pulp and seeds."}
{"text":"I'm always on the look out for a great juice bar, and love supportive local shops. This little juice bar is a hidden gem. With it just recently opening I really hope it succeeds. Everything inside is fresh, and tastes amazing. The two people working there were wonderful, and kind. They had amazing suggestions, offer punch cards, and give student discounts. Their prices are fair, and deserve a try from the surrounding community. 

Also my smoothie was amazing, the menu had a lot of variety too! Inside was beautiful. I can't say enough good things! Tried the freshly squeezed orange juice slush! 10/10."}
{"text":"Huge fan of bubble tea and noticed most of the good ones are located in the North.  This Bubble tea cafe is in Woodbine which is my neighborhood lucky for me.  Went here for the first time to give it a try.  Pretty good so far.  They do use fresh fruits if you order their smoothie.  Hope they do well!  Will come here again."}
{"text":"I've only stopped in once but my mango smoothie was delicious.  I met with a client here during the work day and the downside was that moms brought groups of kids in and it got super noisy.  It's great that Happy Cup has Foosball and board games to play.  It just may not be the best place to do business or seek some peace and quiet.  It's a small venue so I'll likely grab a beverage and go the next time. 

I definitely recommend that you support this small business."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service is excellent, and you're always greeted with a smile when you walk in. Everything I've tried so far has been delicious, though personally I like the strawberry banana smoothie and black milk tea. The only issue is that I can't stop buying these things every time I walk by..."}
