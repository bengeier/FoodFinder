{"text":"I finally got my hands on these sushi burritos, the first and original creative mobile makers of this snack in Toronto, before they wrap up and disappear for the winter.  Ordered Spicy Salmon ($10) and Lobster ($9).  These were the half sized prices.  If you order the full roll, prices are $16 and $18.  Nonetheless, really good, fresh, crunchy, crispy and flavourful.  They were packed with ingredients, very generous size.  It was really funny to eat.  In conclusion, these are ginormous sushi rolls."}
{"text":"They stopped by Toronto General Hospital today so I expected a huge line but it was probably about 12-15 people in front of me when I got there at peak lunch time (12:30-1:00PM). They churn orders out pretty quickly and normally they're doing pretty big orders too. I got the spicy salmon half size $10 and soft shell crab half size $9. Firstly, one is enough. These don't look it but they're pretty sizeable and satisfying for a lunch. So I felt they were priced right too. When you bite into it, it is packed with ingredients, not just rice. They stay pretty true to the original roll's flavour with extra veggies tucked inside like spinach, cabbage and carrots. You can be sure you're eating healthy here. Because it is jam packed with ingredients, the seaweed sheet actually doesn't wrap around the whole thing so make sure to eat it in the paper wrapper or it will fall apart. I would want more pieces of soft shell crab because 2/3's of the way in, there were no more.   The service was great. It was manned by three Asian guys making the rolls and orders were taken by a very sweet European girl, who was quick, accurate and had a pretty good memory. I recommend!"}
{"text":"This sushi burrito is stuffed. Very filling. I got the chef's special and it had salmon, red tuna, white fish (tuna?), avocado, cucumbers, mayo crab, black caviar and slices of mango. The rice was just right. The seaweed did get soggy and chewy pretty quickly. So I don't recommend saving any of it for later. Eat it when you get it. I think it was good but in my opinion its more just the novelty of it.  The roll had too many flavours going on and it was actually quite messy to eat. I found it on the expensive side so I don't think I'll be going back any time soon. If you haven't gone its worth to try at least once."}
{"text":"I can't stop loving sushi. I love it in all shapes and forms. I'll eat a sushi as a pudding if I could.  Well, not really, but you see where I'm going with this. When fellow Yelper Rose V. showed me Sushitto while we were attending the Sweetery Festival, no amount of ramen, smoothies, and macaroons in my tummy would stop me from eating this.  Our roll was ready within 10-15 minutes, which was pleasantly surprising. I really don't get why people complain about the wait times for this establishment. It's someone literally making a GIANT sushi roll amongst other orders inside a small truck. Just because it's shaped like a burrito doesn't mean it will be out as fast as your order from Chipotle. Be patient and let these awesome people do their work. It's totally worth it.  Anyways, we split the Lobster Roll filled with a cooked lobster stick, crab, avocado, red cabbage, cucumber and carrots. It was ginormous and I was surprised the seaweed held all of those contents in place. Everything was room temperature and fresh, and i happily devoured it. It was so good. Why can't this be in Rochester?  If I had any gripes, it would be the use of imitation crab. I know it's common in a lot of sushi but I wouldn't mind paying extra for the real deal. Also, I'm not sure if it's offered, but some kind of spicy soy or wasabi sauce would have been welcomed into my roll. I'll totally inquire next time.  The hype is real here, people. Come through and get your roll on."}
{"text":"I was ecstatic when I found out the sushi burrito trend made it to Toronto and Sushitto On The Road definitely met my expectations. The service was fast and efficient, the wait time was significantly shorter than I expected. I got a full spicy salmon Sushitto for $16 (half orders were $9) and it kept both me and my boyfriend full for a surprisingly long time.   One thing to note is that it's SPICY. I can eat mildly spicy foods but this set my mouth of fireeeee. My boyfriend thought the ingredients were very fresh, and it's good quality sushi but we both agreed it's not something we would come back for everyday.   Overall, it's definitely a great bite to grab and I'd encourage trying it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"I finally got to try the hyped sushitto, and i definitely think its worth the hype.  came around 2:15 at the Royal Alexandra theatre at King west, and its did not have much people, so I got my order fairly quick.  They were out of spicy salmon and the salmon ,and the chef's special! So I decided to grab the crab meat. Honestly at the beginning its quite a struggle to eat, so I highly suggest you actually sit and eat it because it will get slightly messy.   The burrito was stuffed and I got the small one just to try it but it's actually sort of a meal.  Crab Meat sushitto was stuffed with the following:cucumbers,tempura shrimp,crab meat,avocado,the little caviar eggs or eel eggs,rice , garlic mayo and wrapped in seaweed. It was filling and for 8 bucks I did not feel like I need to eat more, it was quite delicious and fresh.  future note for me and any others yelpers, try coming early because I really wanna try the spicy salmon since I read raving reviews.  I will go again and try other ones.   I took off one star because they don't accept debit or visa, only cash! and they did not have my spicy salmon:("}
{"text":"After trying out a few sushi burrito available in Toronto, this is hands down the best. The size is big enough where all the ingredients stick together. There is also not too much sauce and seasoning where you can taste the freshness of ingredients. Healthy alternative to a health conscious meal, not too much rice"}
{"text":"I finally get to try the famous sushitto.  I am so lucky to pass by it today during my lunch time.  On many occasions, I really wanted to track this food truck down, but I was too busy.  What a coincidence today since I really want some salmon.  What's better than eating salmon sushi inside a burrito.  The truck was sitting close to the intersection of King and Church today.    There was not a huge line up which was a big plus.  And the truck looks really clean and sanitary.  The menu looks really simple and all the food itema seems delicious.  I wanted for about five minutea for my spicy salmon sushitto; however, I couldn't be happier.    The sushitto looks so fresh, delicious with bright vibrant colours.  It tastes really good also, the only thing was that the seaweed got a little soggy after I walked with it for five minutes before eating it.   It was really hard to chew of the chewy seaweed after each bite, and that was my only complaint.  The food was really tasty, and I will definitely come back for this food truck."}
{"text":"Visited Sushitto purely based on the #hype that sushi burritos had generated this past year. Starting in Seattle and then eventually coming to Toronto, I knew I had to eventually try it at least once, just to say that I have. I went to Sushitto on the Road on a weekday for lunch and realized a lot of people must've had the same thought because the line was crazy long! We waited for approximately 20 - 25 mins to order and then receiving our order was quick, less than 5 mins.   I order the veggie sushitto, half size. Price was a bit high in my opinion but I had to get it because #hype. They give you a side of spicy mayo if requested, for free! Soy sauce also comes with it. I took it back to my office desk to eat because I knew it would be way too messy to attempt on the road. I was right. I got back to my desk and laid out a mock table cloth of napkins first before starting. I initially thought the nori would be hard to bite through but it wasn't. The soy sauce was a bit useless in my opinion because I had no idea how to use it; I couldn't pour it over my burrito because it would leak everywhere and dipping was also not an option because all my ingredients would fall out. Instead, I ended up spreading on my spicy mayo with a knife for each bite I took. It would've tasted better with soy sauce but not bad with the mayo. The ingredients were fresh and the rice was sticky enough that it held together for the most part. The only time it fell apart was the last few bites.   Would I return? Maybe not, just because of the wait and the price. Taste wise, it definitely delivered!"}
{"text":"Went to the Sushitto food truck for lunch. We got there just before lunch and there was already a line up. I shared the Spicy Salmon burrito and it was pretty good. Felt that the half was quite filling and it wasn't as mild as the traditional spicy salmon maki rolls. The burrito is wrapped in seaweed which had the perfect crunch.   The only downside- found it a little greasy for a sushi wrap.   Verdict - will be going back to try out the crab roll which I hear is delicious. You can follow them on Toronto food trucks to find out their location for the day!"}
{"text":"I had so much expectations coming in since I saw these things all over Instagram.   The sushi burrito was literally just a big sushi. One of them came upto 10$, which I thought was really expensive. It's really messy to eat since it's only wrapped with seeweed.   I don't know if it was just me but the seaweed tasted like paper. I'm someone who's tried almost all sushi restaurants in Toronto and I've neve experiences a seaweed tasting like paper.  There's only one vegetarian option. It didn't have any sauces unlike the other options. So it was just chopped vegetables and rice.  The people was nice. And at least the burrito looked pretty."}
{"text":"Old post:  There was a moderate line-up of people here waiting for their lunch orders when I arrived to the food truck (in July 2017).  The Pho-ritto cost $12.  It had a choice of whole wheat or white tortilla (I chose the whole wheat), beef, cilantro, bean sprouts, rice noodles, hoisin sauce, peppers, and onions.  After I placed my order, I waited about ten minutes to receive it.  I was actually surprised with how short the wait time was because it seemed like I got my order before even some of the other customers who had arrived before me.  The pho-ritto was placed into a Styrofoam box with the Sushitto on the Road logo sticker on the top of it.  The huge pho-ritto was inside the box along with a plastic fork, one slice of lime, napkin, and a container of Sriracha sauce.  I was so excited to try it!  The pho-ritto was huge!  It was wrapped with a piece of foil paper.  I was really impressed with it!  I had previously noted online reviews that stated the pho-ritto wasn't up to par because it lacked the quintessential part of the pho broth.  I think that's a silly comparison to make; if you want a bowl of hot steaming pho with the broth, go for an actual bowl of pho in a restaurant or make it at home!  The fusion of pho plus a burrito is exactly what Sushitto on the Road has created.  It was a burrito with all of the pho elements in it and was made as creatively as possible.  The beef was very juicy and very well flavoured.  I loved it.  There was a lot of cilantro which broke up the heavy meat and carbs.  I was actually surprised to see rice noodles in it too (having not carefully read the description of it when I got it) but it made sense to have rice noodles in it that relate to the pho part.  However, I thought that the rice noodles were a little too hard for my taste.  I loved the pho-ritto thoroughly and thought it was very well made!  I do have to say that I went into this with low expectations due to having read negative reviews online.  Thus, I was pleasantly surprised and extra impressed when I found out that it was a delicious work of art!  Since the phoritto was so large, I actually didn't finish the entire thing in one sitting.  I saved the rest of it for an afternoon snack later that day.   (The Sriracha sauce gave the pho-ritto a good kick and the lime helped to give some acid to the heavy meal -- I wish the lime was bigger actually!)"}
{"text":"I've tried sushitto for about 3 times now... right when it first opened it was a great hit with long lines.. now that it's been in business for some time, it is quite easy to pick one up without waiting too long. Everyday their location is updated on their instagram and they have many \"usual\" spots so not too hard to get ahold of them!  The first time we tried sushitto, we wanted to try so many different kinds. We got the half size of the soft shell, their salmon special, lobster and the spicy salmon. My favourite is definitely the spicy salmon.. this sushitto is stuffed.. and i mean STUFFED with spicy salmon.. the ratio of rice to salmon was perfect. However, the price of the spicy salmon is a little bit more expensive than the other kinds (shocking!) but maybe because they are not stingy with their ingredients. for half a spicy salmon burrito it is 9$, for a full it is 16$. If you can find a friend that will split a full with you, you definitely save 2$ since a full is equivalent to 2 halfs.  The salmon special one is not as amazing because it has cream cheese inside.. unless you're a sushi lover of cream cheese then I caution you to NOT get that one! I was greatly dissapointed and never ordered that one again for my next two visits.  The softshell crab and the lobster was tasty.. essentially tasted like a gigantic spider roll filled with many goodies. Sushitto definitely does not cheap out on their ingredients.. but for their price, i think i might eat a regular roll rather than getting messy with a sushitto!"}
{"text":"The hype is real! Make sure to check their Instagram before you head out to look for the truck. I have been twice and was lucky enough not to have to wait in line (I went both times on a Saturday, within an hour of them opening up). It like having a giant maki roll, except you don't get soya. The burrito itself is quite flavourful so you won't need it. My favorite is the soft shell crab. The price looks steep but it's well worth it. If you happen to see the truck, definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical at first but was very satisfied in the end!!  I had the bulgogi one because I was worried that the salmon one would be \"too much salmon\". It was DELICIOUS!! The flavours and textures blended together very well and and the sticky rice/seaweed wrapping was the cherry on top. Every bite was enjoyable and I was even sad at the end. lol. The half portion was just enough - I was satisfied and not too full. Next time, I think I am going to try the spicy salmon!! Can't wait.   The only reason for giving 4 stars was that the bulgogi one took a bit long to prepare. About 3-4 customers who ordered after me, received their orders before me. The wrapping could also have been a bit tighter because it ended up leaking all over my hands near the last few bites.   Overall though, I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I'm in LOVE and her name is 'Sushitto'.  A co-worker convinced me to swing by this food truck today to sample one of there sushi-burrito fusions. I had for the first time a 1/2 size lobster sushitto which left me craving the other 1/2.  This sushitto was flavorful, and the ratio of the ingredients was perfectly combined so that not one ingredient dominated the other. For example, to much lettuce or sauce.  I'm not a big eater but I really felt myself craving the other half of that lobster sushitto. So do yourself a favor and splurge on the whole sushitto. It's gonna cost you roughly $16-$18, which is pricey but they do a fantastic job.  Definitely a well deserved once in awhile splurge.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Da Vinci is alive! Except this time he was reincarnated as a chef and created the masterpiece called Sushitto. Sushi + burrito = one of those cases where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. This fusion is so legendary that it deserves it's own Dragon Ball Z series. I think I just found a new goal in life, which is to try out everything on their menu"}
{"text":"Best best best sushi burrito ever!!!  Got this for lunch today- price is reasonable. I would recommend getting the large size so you can customize what's in the roll. ($14 for salmon roll)  I got the salmon burrito. They put a lot of avocado and salmon in it. Ingredients are fresh. It honestly just tastes like sushi except it's much bigger.  Usually on the weekend they are at the royal Alexandre theatre and weekdays at Mel lastman square. Follow their Instagram to know where they will be at!"}
{"text":"The rice is amazing, the spicy salmon sauce is amazing...i probably go here 2x a week like a fanboy"}
{"text":"My mind is blown: sushi burritos. Now I've seen it all. Good, tasty, awesome. A definite must try."}
{"text":"Came across this food truck and decided to give it a try. I opted for the medium Soft Shell Crab 'burrito'. Nice choice of fresh ingredients without over doing the rice. Good flavours and textures. The medium is pretty big. If you're a fan of sushi rolls then you'll love Sushitto.  Service friendly, presentation good."}
{"text":"Ratings: Food: 8/10 Drink: n/a Service: 8/10 Value: 8/10 Hygiene: 8/10 Aesthetics: 7/10  This being the very first sushi burrito place that I saw open in Toronto, I had to track it down and see how it stood up to other sushi burritos.  The sushi burrito I ordered had the house special which had cream cheese, tuna and salmon.  The ingredients were fresh and the burrito itself was packaged really nicely. I'm not a big fan of cream cheese in my burrito, but it wasn't too bad. I wish I had known about the cream cheese beforehand, as I had only seen tuna and salmon listed on the sign.  The cost is around $10 for half a burrito and about  $15 for the whole.  I think it is a decent place, but being a food truck makes it a little more difficult to track down or enjoy in the winter cold."}
{"text":"Stopped by with a friend on a Saturday afternoon. No lineup for ordering but to get food, we had wait a bit as they prepared it. My friend ordered the bulgogi and I had the spicy salmon roll. My friend's order took longer to make, about 10 minutes or so because of the beef I guess.   I'm usually use to a bit of spiciness in spicy salmon rolls, but this was too much for me. I needed to drink lots of water. lol. There was also a bit too much cucumber then I would have liked but the amount of salmon provided was pretty good.   Overall, I found it filling. However, my friend said they were still hungry. I don't think either of us were super in love with it to try this again. Like it's good but not amazing. If you try it but are not good with spiciness then I recommend trying the other rolls. Also, staff were nice enough. They give you an order number and call it out when it's ready so people don't wait around standing or blocking the order area."}
{"text":"The sushi burrito is definitely a very exciting concept, but there are quite a few issues with this food truck. For starters, the lineup is usually extremely long. I visited on a weekday lunchtime and the entire time it took me from lining up to getting my sushitto took around 25 minutes. For a quick grab-and-go lunch, that was definitely too much time. I had half a soft shell crab sushitto and it was good - the crab was crunchy, the sauce was nice and the ingredients seemed fresh. It was $9, and not that filling (half a sushitto is quite small!), so the value of it was definitely off.  They are also very active on Instagram, so if you'd like to get in touch with the owners or see where the truck is, etc. I would recommend talking to them over Instagram. Maybe once in a while if you have time to spare, then I'd recommend you try it out, but otherwise, not that worth it."}
{"text":"The wait was about one hour during lunch hour. Also, the burrito-sized roll was way too much! Stick to normal maki. On the plus side, it was a great picture for social media."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi burrito fusion. I got the chef's special (salmon, white tuna, avocado, imitation crab meat, cream cheese) and the eel. It looks small in its little case, but trust me, you can get full with just one order. The chef's special is my favorite. I liked the texture of the raw fish combined with the creaminess of the avocado. The cream cheese, along with the mayonnaise-y crab meat, overwhelmed the sushiritto (they could have put less) but for those who like that cream cheese sweet-savory flavor, you'll appreciate their no holds barred approach. The eel wasn't that great - it had a chewy texture that is different than an unagidon (eel rice bowl).   Eat the sushiritto on the day of - it's fresher that way, and rice dries in the fridge. If you're not a fan of raw fish, they also have bulgogi beef, chicken and vegetarian options.  The line is long, and this is an understatement. You will wait for 45+ minutes if you are not in front of the truck as it is pulling onto the curb.  Also, fyi - their instagram account lists its location the day of, but it can be confusing to figure out."}
{"text":"The sushi burritos here are amazinggggg. They look pricey but they're actually cheaper than Rolltation on Dundas and taste much muchhh bettter than Rolltation. My bf and I got Chef's sepcial and salmon rolls. They were both really good and the portion was very fullfilling. I personally prefer the chef's special one over the salmon since it had more sauce and was more flavourful. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"If you love the combination of sushi and burrito-you'll love sushitto!  I've been following them on instagram (@sushittoontheroad) for a while trying to eat it.  One day I decided to follow them outside of Toronto General Hospital to grab one.  I went at noon and waited for approx an hour.  As I was in front of the line, the line got shorter- so if you want to avoid the long line up..go later but there's a chance they might sell out.  I ordered the full chefs special burrito for $16 and shared with my friend.  The chefs special (salmon and tuna sashimi) tasted so good.  Inside the sushitto, there was also mayo imitation crab meat (generally not a fan of mayo), avocado, mango slices, cream cheese (I thought it was a bit weird) and some vegetables.  It was a bit too soggy for my liking.  I thought they would be heavy on the rice but they weren't.  The amount of rice in the sushitto was just perfect.  I really enjoyed the sushitto but I would not wait an hour (again) for this.    I tried their eel (unagi) sushitto for free during their free sushittos giveaway (with donations) at Oakridge Park.  I waited for approx 30mins in line.  I thought they would give a mini sushitto since it was \"free\".  The size of the sushitto that they give away is their regular size as when you pay.  The eel sushitto was filled with a lot of veggies and moderate amount of eel.  During my first couple of bites, I thought they gave me a veggie sushitto because I did not taste the eel.  When I took a bite of the eel, it tasted delicious.  Again, the amount of rice in the sushitto was just enough.  If you love veggies and eel, this would be the perfect sushitto for you!"}
{"text":"I was torn between 3 and 4 stars as the expectation and build-up (with the long line in front of the truck) set the bar high. I had heard of the concept before of a \"sushi burrito\" but always thought the size would be too big. One of the joys of eating maki rolls is their one bite size. And even sushi \"cones\" are small enough to take in all the ingredients with each bite.  When you take those same ingredients ( a California Roll and Salmon maki) and roll them into a burrito-sized roll, it becomes a bit too much. By the time you get to the last part of the sushitto, it will come apart. It's also hard to experience all the flavors together since you can't fit the whole thing in your mouth, so you need to bite off the sides which means a few ingredients at a time.  The overall taste of the Salmon sushiito was good however $9 is a bit much for half an order when a whole order is $12. If you order a half portion, they make the whole thing and cut it in half, presumably storing the second half until someone orders the same thing.  If you go during lunch hour the wait can be up to an hour. However I came back at 2:30pm and there was no one at the truck. And while the taste and novelty were good, I can't see myself craving sushittos that much. Howvever it is cheaper than a couple of orders of maki rolls."}
{"text":"Pricey but good.  Full size Tuna & Salmon Sushitto was $16.  Definitely yummy, and you can stretch it into two meals if you're not overly hungry, but it's still pretty steep!  Definitely agree with people on the lineups, but I planned ahead and went right when they opened to beat the rush.  Took about 5-10 minutes to get mine as they were still getting things ready inside the truck.  It was pouring rain and I got soaked, so it would be nice if they'd get a bigger overhanging cover for people to wait under.  They hooked me up with a free cup of the Pho soup.  Not bad, not great, but it was hot and helped with waiting.  I'll definitely have it again, just not that often.  3.5/5"}
{"text":"This was my first sushitto, so I don't really have a frame of reference, but I love buritos and sushi, so what could be bad.   Found the truck in liberty village and the line was HUGE, so decided to come back at non-peak lunch hour. They are a cash only business.   I got the chef's special (salmon + tuna), which was packed with yummy goodness including the aforementioned tuna, salmon, simulated crab, avocado, cucumber, black roe, cabbage, cream cheese (which i could have done without, but what is a burrito without cheese...), mango (this was a nice touch!), and rice...there might (probably) was more than I am forgetting.  What really topped of the experience for me was their commitment to quality. One of my rolls was (apparently) smaller than their standard, so they threw in an extra half to compensate for that (personally, just 1/2 was quite large already, so this was just gravy!). I think it's a super cool food, and would definitely recommend to all food enthusiast!"}
{"text":"Great for sharing a quick snack. I had the chefs special and the fillings worked well together. Looking forward for more options and more price point variety."}
{"text":"Sushitto on the road stopped by at Yonge and Sheppard today so finally got a chance to try it. Was almost an hour wait though.   Spicy Salmon Sushitto ($9) It's like a modernized fusion sushi roll to go - spicy salmon with tempura bits, cucumbers, avocado, lettuce, rice, wrapped in seaweed. I got half of the Sushitto which costed $9, $15 for the full. It was pretty good, flavorful. The spicy salmon was actually quite spicy. One thing was, it seems like there's a lot of spicy salmon but majority of it was mashed tempura bits drenched in the sauce looking like salmon, but actual salmon pieces weren't that many. Quite expensive for what it's worth. The doesn't look like much but half was actually pretty filling."}
{"text":"Best food truck in the city hands down! I din't know why this concept took so long to take iff but it's genius!   Everything is so fresh and the fish to rice ratio is perfect. I'm a sucker for spicy and highly recommend the spicy salmon! If you can catch them at the end of day on a weekend, they sell them at half off as well.  Follow them on ig for location updates!"}
{"text":"I am a huge Sushi fan, but an ever bigger Pho fan...so when I saw the PHOritto - I just HAD to try it! And I am so glad I did. It tasted exactly like a freshly served warm bowl of Pho. It was $10.00 and I had tried it while visiting Taste of Little Italy (don't worry - I had Gelato after to make sure I got my fix of Italian sweets and treats!).  The PHOritto has all the good stuff rolled into a burrito and is served alongside Sriracha and Hoisin sauce (for the win!).  It was juicy, and warm - the only thing that was missing was the actual broth, but you could tell the meat was cooked in a very flavourful broth.  ABSOLUTELY worth a try if you love PHO!  The only thing that I would have to say, is that they didn't really have a very clear line as to where you pay and pick up - it was a bit of a mess, so I saw people move on because they didn't know where the line was.  Lost opportunity for them. I didn't have very much of a wait, maybe because of the location/day/time I went - so I'm very happy about that, but even if there was a wait - I'd definitely recommend trying it at least once! :)"}
{"text":"YES! If you love sushi and you're lucky that this truck happens to stop by around your office, you gotta get this. It's not one of those fad's that you try once to get a picture (ahem Sweet Jesus), you'll actually want it again. I usually get disappointed by food trucks because they are expensive for the small portion size but this one is actually really good and they don't skimp out on the ingrendients!  I had the chef's special with tuna and salmon it was amazing! Now I picked this up early May just before the hype at Bloor and Church, so come by 11:30am~ to avoid the line up. For updates on their whereabouts follow their instagram page."}
{"text":"I've been hunting this truck down all summer! Check their Instagram for daily updates for where they are in the city. It was about $9 for half a burrito which filled me up to the equivalent of 2 sushi rolls. It gets a little messy since you have to pour the soya sauce onto the burrito. I opted for the spicy salmon burrito and there was a good ratio of salmon and rice.   Sushitto is something you need to try at least once! A great choice if you're in a rush and don't have time to sit down at an AYCE sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"I tried the phoritto today and I must say it was delicious. Although I wouldn't say it tasted like pho, the meat was cooked very well and is super flavourful. Defiantly worth the price. I wasn't a fan of the amount of cilantro as it's such a strongly flavoured leaf and peppers don't belong in pho but other than that very good."}
{"text":"I tried the chef special sushi burrito one weekend when it was parked by Enercare Centre. I had been following them on instagram and wanted to try one of their delicious creations. I encountered no lineup that one Sunday and got my food quickly. If you love sushi this is 10x better. Although the price is a bit expensive, you get what you pay for as the burrito is stuffed with raw fish and veggies. There is not an over abundance of rice which is perfect. I would happily eat a sushi burrito from this food truck if I had the chance to."}
