{"text":"We went on 12/ 27 -The cheese fries were great. But the rest of the food was a disappointment. The ribs were dry, the veggies over done, the smaller steak was okay, but not great - not good enough to order again.   Chicken Caesar salad was the only thing good enough to take the left overs home, but even that was only so so. It was fairly quiet, but also pretty empty when we went.  Even though it WAS empty, we were seated where we had to face one of the large TV's at the bar -- without being asked our preference (which is to sit where TV's aren't part of the scene when we're out for dinner).  It was also very dim -- lighting appropriate for a romantic dinner at a fine restaurant (or to hide shabbiness or dirt I suppose).  This is not a romantic restaurant, nor does it offer any thing like fine dining. We were sorely disappointed and will not be back."}
{"text":"The steaks were ok but everything else was bad. We ordered the onion appetizer and it was just awful, also the mashed potatoes tasted like cinnamon, they must have used the butter for the bread when making them, they were awful, and our server was obvious on something, he was sweaty, shaky, and moving around a little to fast,he also spilled one of our drinks on the table. Will not be going back"}
{"text":"Our family ate here again last night.  A ribeye dinner, a terriyaki chicken dinner, a burger and i had the Buffalo Chicken salad. Everyone enjoyed their meal.  Our server was Faith, second time around, very attentive.  I wasn't crazy about the chicken in the salad, BW3 has better and i would omit the tortilla chips (i assume a substitute for coutons), yet i did enjoy the pecans and peppers in the salad.  yeah, i would order it again."}
{"text":"I was up for steak tonight but rather than drive across town to my standby favorite Texas Roadhouse, I decided to give Montana Mike's a try based on the reviews here.  Big mistake.  Upon entering, I was \"greeted\" by a young woman with hair dyed a bizarre shade of red and a personality of a wet mop.  She led me to my table as if it was an inconvenience.  As I was seated in view of her, I can attest to the fact that she treated every customer with the same indifference and never changed the sour expression on her face.  I sat at my table.  And sat.  And sat.  And sat.  I was getting myself ready to leave when another young woman with a personality came and asked if I had been attended to.  I said no and she took my order and told me the name of my actual server, who was apparently off somewhere else.  He eventually arrived with my drink and salad.  The salad and the blue cheese dressing were okay.  Having finished I awaited my mushroom appetizer.  And waited.  And waited.  Finally the pleasant young lady, not my server, arrived with both my appetizer and entrée, apologizing for their simultaneous arrival.  Seems my server dropped the ball.  Rather than eat cold steak, I let the mushrooms sit and dove into my entrée, an 8 ounce sirloin.  Disappointing.  In all my years eating at the Texas Roadhouse, I never got a bad piece of meat.  This was a bad piece of meat.  Though it looked cooked to perfection color wise, it was tough and gristly and tepid.  I managed to find a few edible pieces.  The loaded potato was quite good.  I then tried the appetizer which by now had gone cold.  Too bad, it tasted like it might have once been good.  Now it was merely cold and soggy and accompanied by the same off-tasting ranch dressing commented upon by others.  All I wanted at this point was to get out of there, tempted as I was to ask to see the manager.  I'm a foodie and I watch many of competitions like Top Chef.   I learned from them that in the restaurant business, one cannot excuse even one experience of poor service and substandard food.  All say the same thing; good service and good food is a must every time because first impressions are lasting. My first impression of Montana Mike's, from the red-haired sourpuss to the poor service and disappointing food, was a negative one and I shall not return."}
{"text":"I was tethering between 3 and 4 stars but decided the 4 stars was more appropriate. The servers were very nice and attentive. We ordered the fried mushrooms for an appetizer and they were really good and there were a lot of them. The bread was really good with Cinnamon sugar butter. I found out that I should not have ordered an entree. I was stuffed from the appetizer and bread. I did order an entree however. I ordered the mountaintop grilled chicken.   The side salad is not much to write home about. I asked the server if they made the ranch dressing and he said they do make it. I prefer homemade ranch to bottled so I ordered the ranch. The ranch was not good and I don't know why. It didn't taste like ranch dressing. It had some funky taste I could not identify. So, avoid the ranch dressing on the salad. It will ruin your salad. There isn't much to the side salad anyway. Just some lettuce and tomato. You really don't need it anyway because you get plenty to eat.   The mountaintop grilled chicken was very good. However, in the future I would order it minus the cheese. There was way too much cheese. I scraped it off. The grilled chicken underneath is fantastic!! I also had the green beans and they were really good too. And you get a lot of green beans too. I would most certainly go back and try something else. Maybe their Cesar salad is better then the house salad with ranch."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Montana Mikes was early June 2010. We were pleasantly surprised by the amount of food you get for the price. I ordered beef tips (which were excellent), my father ordered the sirloin steak which he said he was happy with, and my mom ordered the salmon, which she said was excellent. With our salads, they brought us three buns with yummy cinnamon butter; the first batch was better than the second, I think the second batch was in the oven about 2 minutes too long!  We returned to Montana Mike's this past weekend to celebrate Fathers Day. Again, we had a pretty good experience. The only negative I can say was that (yes - it was busy and we expected to wait) we ended up waiting over 25 minutes, and in the end were seated at bar tables that they claim they don't like to seat people at unless they ask first - personally, they could have asked 15 minutes earlier and we still would have said no problem sitting there.   Overall both of our experiences have been just fine (waiters and waitresses have been pleasant and attentive; food good and what we expected) and I would say we will return again so long as it continues."}
{"text":"The food was bland. Ribs dry and tough. If you want cafeteria food you would do better going to a real cafeteria. Go somewhere else for your meal, $50 for cafeteria food is outrageous. If all you care about is quantity and not things like flavor,or quality maby you might like this place."}
{"text":"Ate here while in town for business.  This easily could have been 4 stars but for two things-- the sirloin steak was under-seasoned and the mushrooms were over-seasoned.  The quality of the meat was good and there was a nice smoky taste, but it didn't pop due to the lack of seasoning.  I definitely can't complain about the value, however.  The portions were generous for the price and it was all good enough that I cleaned my plate."}
{"text":"I give this place 3 and a half stars.   Charming and cozy ambience, friendly and attentive staff, and pretty good food.  I love their potato boats. Mmmm! With some sour cream they really hit the spot on a Friday night.   Not so crazy about their ranch dressing. Like another reviewer said, there's something a little off about their ranch. I think it's much too salty. And this, coming from a salt junkie!!  Actually it was their salt friendliness that ruined my baby back ribs as well. I just got this feeling that the chef got a little too salt crazy last night!!  Hopefully it was a one time thing with the salt! I will be back."}
{"text":"We've been back several times - they have been really good about letting us split meals (we're both trying to be good about eating, and their portions are enough to split and not be hungry!)  We've had the chicken-fried steak, the ribeye, the porterhouse, the chicken tenders - the ONLY gripe we have is that they always are out of prime rib by mid-Sunday afternoon. (If you want prime rib, go Friday or Saturday!) Love the rolls with the cinnamon butter, fresh salad fixings, and the way they fix green beans is GREAT with lots of bacon and mushrooms. Definitely someplace to include on your list for home-game-weekends - but be aware that they pack out fast - call to see what the wait is."}
{"text":"I have sat on this review for over a week to see if my feelings changed about the establishment as time went by.  Unfortunately, they have not.   Three of us went to dinner a week ago friday and were served a horrible meal and had a horrible experience.  My boyfriend ordered prime rib, I ordered the kabob, and my friend ordered some other steak.  Shortly there after, the server returns to tell us \"The Prime Rib machine is broken.\"  Umm... what is a prime rib machine?  Anyway, he changes his order to the NY strip.  All of us got the baked potato with sour cream, cheese, and what I think were supposed to be bacon bits.  The food came out fairly quickly, however, this turned out to be a bad thing.  The server asked us to cut into our steaks/meat to make sure it was done, and we did.  In the dim lighting, it seemed like everything was fine.  However, as the meal progressed, we saw that everything was not fine.  The potatoes were cold, the cheese wasn't even melted on them, and they were just not good.  Both my boyfriend's steak and my kabobs turned out to be completely raw in the middle.  I, unfortunately, did not realize my meat was raw until I was chewing on a hunk of kabob and look down to see the other part of the meat was sitting there on the plate in all its raw glory.  We asked the server to see the manager, and two good ol' boys came over and tried to make us just send the meat back to have it re-cooked.  I don't know about anyone else, but chewing on a piece of raw meat really puts you off of eating any more at that point.  These managers didn't offer to get us something else or even throw us a free dessert.  They also felt the need to do the fake buddy-buddy act and try to be our friends including patting us on the back and such.  If I don't know you, don't touch me, especially when I'm on the way to Super Pissed Town.  After much back and forth, we finally convinced the manager that we were, indeed, unhappy and did not want to eat their crappy food and did not want to pay for raw meat.  They finally capitulated and agreed to take the two entrees off the bill.  And, as it turns out they never actually took off anything from the bill that they said they would.  After the server brought our bill out, it was exactly as it was supposed to be if the meal had been good.  We asked for the manager again... 20 minutes later, one strolls by and blames the server for the error.  15 more minutes go by and we get the  exact same bill again.  At this point we seriously considered leaving without paying, but we didn't want the server to get the shaft because she actually seemed competent and her managers were the stupid ones.  In summary, if you like raw meat and being treated like a child by some good ol' boys, by all means, go to Montana Mike's.  If you want a decent steak and a better atmosphere, go ANYWHERE else."}
{"text":"The staff was spot on, the decor and wood chairs, seating were awesome. I loved their mashed potatoes and salads. I had their shrimp and it was great!"}
