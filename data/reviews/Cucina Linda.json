{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. It's a family favorite for us. They are welcoming to children of all ages, they make us feel comfortable for the lengthy time we stay, (usually 2+ hrs) and their food is always really, really good. When they have the live music, the kids in our group love to dance along. I feel like I'm part of a big family gathering when I eat here."}
{"text":"We went for lunch and found Cafe Linda to be charming and the food to be authentic Italian. Don't miss the minestrone soup. Wait staff are polite, helpful and efficient. Pizza, pasta, bread basket, everything was delicious."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places, if not my favourite, in Montreal. Their servers are the best human beings, they are so kind and helpful whenever. It's a family business and it's been here for a long time, so the regular customers have been there for a long time too. What a gem in Verdun, right around the corner from where I live. I had their Alfredo pasta and Primavera pizza, both of which were extraordinary. Their prices are not super expensive either. Considering the quality of the food they serve there, it's super worthy of the price. They have a set menu thing too, it was about $20 and it came with a salad, a main dish (this you can pick from a few dishes), a dessert, and a coffee. The owner of the restaurant is such a warm person too, and she sets the atmosphere of the restaurant. I'm always going to go there when I feel like really good food, I trust that they will never disappoint."}
{"text":"Went for my dads 65th birthday we were a party of 10. I guess they ran out of room and instead of telling us know they placed us beside the piano and the man was jamming all night extremely loud and singing very loud. We had to yell to eachother and my aunt is already hard of hearing.

To make it a even better night we had 1 menu for 10 people. I don't see where all their menus went but that's un heard of and if that does happen then you place a board up so others can see or even explain what's on the menu.

Extremely disorganized place I've never been to it this was my first time besides my uncle who came 20 years ago. The birthday boy was less then impressed with being right on top of the piano, older woman coming up dancing drunk beside out table with litteraly 5 inches to dance almost hit my poor father in the head. 2 hours to get food is terrible service and I had to chase down the waitress for a bill which was like a rat race. We almost left nobody wanted their food in the end and the waitress gave said \" yeah well your foods gonna take long because you took no appetizers.\" I'm sorry but what planet are you from ? You put the order in right away. 23 dollars for a Sprite and plate of pasta... meh ! You can go down the street to lin time 14.95 pasta plate all home made and delicious and it's BYOW."}
