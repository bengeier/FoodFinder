{"text":"Convenient place for Vietnamese - they offer a great selection of foods for what is essentially a lunch counter.  Their \"bread and butter\" is the banh mi - they are so busy they roll them out conveyor belt style. So there will probably be some waiting when you walk in - or you can order one specifically to suit your taste. I usually get the regular without butter, mayo or chilis.  They also have other types of foods like desserts, steamed buns and small meals such as a pork chop with rice noodles for around $5.  I tend towards the spring rolls. They are like eating a fresh salad - usually filled with prawns, sausage or tofu along with rice noodles, butter lettuce and pickled carrots. The sauces that come with it are not the best I've ever had - but still a good deal at $4.25.   I also don't usually like to eat deep fried spring rolls that have been sitting on a counter, but theirs are stuffed full of pork and veggie. It's so good I just heat them up at home and it's totally worth it to blow my diet at $1.50 each.  Their coffee is excellent - a beautiful dark roast over ice. Perfect  Staff are so professional.   Worth a visit if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The staff here are so much nicer than at the Steeles location, and I personally prefer the desserts here to the Steeles location as well.  Of course Nguyen Huong is famous for its Banh Mi, as they should be because their Banh Mi are delicious. However, they have lots of Vietnamese desserts and other pre-made snacks and meals. Their pandan honeycomb cake is amazing, as is their tri-coloured dessert (che ba mau) - if you're going to eat the che ba mau right away, let them know, they will pour it  into a larger cup and add crushed ice to it. It is $0.50 extra but much yummier this way. But if you're going to take it home to eat later, obviously don't get the ice otherwise it will melt and water down your dessert. I recommend you crush your own ice and add it at home, and then mix everything up. It cuts down on the sweetness and tastes like Halo-Halo or Ais Kacang.  They also sell Asian-style beef jerky, which I really like, but who am I kidding I like all types of beef jerky, lol.   I've never had any of the pre-packaged meals here but they look appetizing and freshly made. I've had various snacks and desserts and they are all good.   The plaza in which it is located is not the most aesthetically pleasing and going from one end to the other you will likely encounter at least 3 different panhandlers. The parking lot is pretty chaotic. In terms of location, I definitely prefer their other sites (they have 4 stores across the GTA), but for service and quality, I like this one better."}
{"text":"This was my first time here! It was quite busy. The food was prepared fresh. Excellent prices. We used to go to a place downtown but this is much more convenient. We were very happy with our find. The sandwiches were delicious!"}
{"text":"If you go early it tastes sooooooo good. Everything is fresh. The bread is amazing in the morning. My friend also says you can ask them to add more of something on your sandwich"}
{"text":"Hands' down thE best place for Banh Mi and other delectable Viet. delights.  Now that Tet is coming, the place was FULL of freshly-made, warm sweet rice treats ... and ... my all-time favourite - PANDAN CAKE.  The salad rolls here are very good (this is a take out place) and the sesame balls (with yellow-bean) are a serious indulgence, not to be taken lightly.  The home-made lap-xhong sausage and other meat dishes are exquisite.  Apart from the food which is always stellar, there is another important factor that keeps me coming back time after time after time.  THEY ARE NICE, POLITE, FRIENDLY owners who are kind and pleasant to their customers and value their patrons' business!  This place has done well, they deserve all the praise.  A wonderful place - fantastic authentic 100% true Viet. \"street food\" which I remember from Vietnam.  Quality products.  No scrimping on ingredients."}
{"text":"Food isn't bad here. The Banh mi is good, great to pick up a quick snack.  They have Nem nuong to can buy and bring home and the beef wrapped in the leaf. I like that.  They also have Vietnamese coffee. Desserts and other foods other than Banh mi"}
