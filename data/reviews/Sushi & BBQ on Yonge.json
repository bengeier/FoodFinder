{"text":"Go there for the 4.95 lunch. Good rolls, always fresh and tasty. I haven't found a better lunch deal for sushi at downtown Yonge area..."}
{"text":"Since my first visit last summer, I've stopped into this place at least once every time I visit Toronto, and it's remained a solid staple.  Two updates: (1) Although wifi is not advertised, there were two open networks that I was able to connect to and use for free the last time I ate there (a week ago.)  (2) I failed to mention it the first time around, but the service and people are really wonderful, and a part of why I always make sure to grab my lunch here.  The place is run and staffed entirely by Japanese people as far as I could tell, and they always greet you with a friendly \"Hello!\" from the kitchen when you walk in and a \"Goodbye! Thank you!\" when you leave.  Someone takes my order within five seconds of putting my menu down, and dishes are cleared instantly - but since I had a laptop out and was by myself, the waitress made sure to let me know that even though she was clearing my stuff, that I could stay as long as I liked.  Really friendly service, really good and authentic food, and really cheap."}
{"text":"I ordered the bibimbap several times from this restaurant and the last two times the egg was broken on top of the dish.    I ordered the Salmon sushi and sashimi bento box and they did not provide pickled ginger with the wasabi.  The Korean soup special is no good.  It is high sodium soup base with noodle.  Not many vegetables and it tasted like they were powdered vegetables."}
{"text":"Ehhhh. This place is pretty much like any other typical sushi joint in downtown Toronto.   The variety of cheap bento boxes for dinner is pretty good. I got the Sashimi Bento for only $10.50, and while the pieces weren't huge or anything, they were relatively fresh.   My friend got the BBQ beef bento for only $7.95 and finished his entire box before I'd finished half of mine! Guess it was good.   A few things:  1) The japchae was all chopped up in tiny strands and not long like the usual noodles....annoying to eat. And a bit too oily.   2) Not enough wasabi :(   3) No free green tea ice cream like Sushi on Bloor, haha.   Good for its price, in short."}
{"text":"Hungry and waiting for some friends at Wellesley station, this place was in view and I decided to drop in.    First I'm assaulted by a huge colourful sign detailing many delightful and CHEAP combos.  I got a sashimi deal.  From a small, affordable takeout joint such as this I didn't really expect much in terms of quality of the fish - but hot damn that salmon is smooth and buttery and everything I dream of at night.  The meal also came with soup, salad, glass noodles, bonus nigiri (!!!) and maki.  Oh, and the service staff are super friendly.    As a sushi lover, yall should go."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place. The $5 lunch specials are awesome. The rolls are delicious and fill you, and it comes with salad, soup and unlimited tea!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  I think they have the best salmon in the city.  It's always buttery and delicious.  The service is quick and friendly for take out or dine-in, and prices are very reasonable.  I should note that I always get one of the bentos (usually salmon teriyaki but beef bulgogi is really good too) so I can't comment on the other dishes.  It's a bit of a hole in the wall but it's my favourite sushi in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love this place! For $4.95, at lunch, you get soup, salad, and your choice of two maki rolls (California, avocado, avocado & cucumber, yam tempura, salmon and spicy salmon). The waitress is super fast, and friendly. Ive never had to wait for my meal here! I've also ventured out and tried the sushi combo as well as the red and green dragon rolls. The fish is top notch.   I do have to agree that the Korean noodle soup is about on par with Shin Ramyun, and isn't worth ordering (although I will say that it was the photo of this meal in the window on a freezing cold day that drew me inside for the first time), but everything else I can recommend."}
{"text":"I don't eat in other Japanese restaurants very often but I eat here at least once a week. Good food in good sized portions - I can really only comment on the Bento boxes - friendly fast service and good prices. For what it sets out to be the restaurant is excellent."}
{"text":"Cheap lunch specials - we ordered the $4.95 bulgogi special - comes with rice and small appetizers of glass noodles, salad, miso soup. No issues - fast and cheap."}
{"text":"Great place! A bit of a hidden gem. This is a case of \"don't judge a book by it's cover.\" The place isn't the most attractive, but it delivers in terms of food, price, and value. I had an enormous sushi dinner for $12.50, which actually included a lot of fish!  The quality of the sushi was fine, although not the best. But at this price point it's certainly acceptable. Their lunch specials looked super cheap, so I'd definitely come back here to try that. The service was VERY fast -- all our food came out in less than 10 minutes.   If you're looking for a quick, cheap sushi place that will fill up your belly without emptying your wallet, this is a perfect place."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap cafeteria-style jap/korean joint, this is one of my faves!  I love this restaurant, despite some of the reviews, it's where I crave to go sometimes.  They have lots in variety, they have a good price point and it's cash only.  (They have an ATM if need be).  The service is fast and the food is always tasty.  I go there a lot for the Bento Boxes, take out is amazing!  I ask them to make it with less oil (BEEF BULGOGI) but it comes with many sides: salad, sushi, jap chae, gyoza.  Try the sushi, it's large and fresh!  I love this place, it's delicious!"}
{"text":"We just don't get sushi like this in the burgh.    I visited this restaurant after reading all of the positive reviews. I had high hopes.   I was pleased with the atmosphere and beyond pleased with my meal.  The resturant has a relaxed no fuss vibe which I dig in a major way.   Sushi doesn't always have to be so ritzy bring on the comfort sushi please.   I ordered a number 6 which was the bento box with sushi california rolls, tempura shrimp and tempura vegetables and clear noodles.    This was my first ever experience with clear noodles.  When pictured I always thought they were cold, but that is not true the clear noodles are warm.   The bento boxes are huge, Sushi & BBQ served me my largest sushi bento  box I have ever eaten.  It seemed like it was twice the size of bento boxes I had had in the past.   The tempura was heavenly, fried to perfection with the vegtables still keeping  their shape. My tempura consisted of brocoli, sweet pototes, shrimp, aparagus.   I cannot wait to get back to Toronto so I can sample more from Sushi & BBQ on Younge."}
{"text":"Tempted in by there $5 lunch offers...as a lady who lunches I do love a lunch bargain!  So $5 maki rolls, choice of 2 different rolls totaling 8 pieces, salad and soup for $5! That is what my friends had, I opted for the take sushi set which was around $10.  So the outside left me thinking hmm a tad sketchy but we tried it nonetheless. The sushi was fresh enough. This place is basically like any other sushi place in the area.   Menu is a decent size and there is a number of different options for bento."}
{"text":"The 5 star from Angela threw me off.    I've had much better paying the same price. Though some of you may think 2 stars is a bit harsh, I'm pretty picky with my food.  They had this side dish which looked half Korean/half Japanese version of chapjae.  It was really greasy, but that's not wasn't even the worst part.   The fried tofu was horrible.   I think the restaurant has good potential if they stop trying to do everything and just focus on making one thing really well.  When will restaurant owners realize its not about how cheap a place is but how GOOD a place is.  Price is 2ndary."}
{"text":"Not really an update on our review, but we tried to grab some cheap lunch yesterday (September 02, 2012), and it was closed. There were posters everywhere with the header \"GRAND OPENING\" or something like that...the sign also changed to restaurant name that appeared on those posters. :/ Time to find a new place with yummy and affordable sushi."}
{"text":"Love this place.   Menu is great, prices are wonderful and everything I have tried tastes awesome.  I've been here a couple times and am never disappointed.  Great for takeout.  It's a small place with about 10 tables.  Staff is quick and attentive.  Dragon roll, Spider roll and spicy salmon are really yummy !"}
{"text":"Great sushi. I stopped in for a quick lunch. Service was fast and friendly. I had the maki lunch special - only 4.95. Brown rice was 1.50 more. The sushi was incredibly fresh  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I agree with Kelly K. I go here very frequently for the lunch special and get the yam tempura and spicy salmon rolls. I usually ask not to have all the extras (wasabi, ginger,salad) but I love the miso soup here! My take out order is always read in 5 minutes.   This is a great place for a decent, cheap meal.    UPDATE NOVEMBER 2012:  After weeks of  closed doors, chairs up, unrequited lunch orders,  and speculation, this place has now become a Korean late night bar of sorts. Thanks for the torment I went through, going back day after day, looking for a quick sushi fix. Do you know how long it's been since I've had sushi ???"}
{"text":"Sushi & BBQ has been a secret retreat of mine since I moved into the neighbourhood a year ago. I usually end up coming here at least once a week solo. The tables are quite small and the quiet, well lit room is most suitable for reading the paper or catching up with a friend.    If you also live and/or eat alone often, you'll appreciate how difficult it can be to cook for one and eat well at the same time. Regardless of whether you go alone or with friends though, you'll appreciate the variety that Sushi & BBQ's bento boxes have. Each one comes with salad, sesame glass noodles, rice, two salmon nigiri, and a trio of california rolls. Some of my favourites are the sashimi bento ($10.95) and tempura bento ($7.95). Trying to make your decision while staring at all the vibrant photos of the options can be a dizzying experience, but at around $10 a bento, you can surely afford to come back to try them all.  Although it used to be \"counter-only\" service, the incredibly friendly cashier always brought the food right to the table and was great with refilling water. From today's visit though, it seems that things are a little different now. Upon coming through the door, I was ushered to a table (v.s. walking right up to the cashier to make my order and pay first) to which my server immediately brought a large bound menu (an upgrade on the old double-fold paper take out menus) right to me.   The sushi is always fresh, the tempura delicately crispy, the prices low, and now there's superb table service to boot! I've been made a whole new fan."}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch here a few times and I have no major complaints.  As a lunch spot it's bang on what I usually look for - quick, tasty and cheap.  It has $4.95 lunch! Just when you think sushi lunch specials can't get any cheaper, they do here! They have a few options at that price range, I usually get the sushi combo with choice of 2 rolls (6 pieces per roll), miso soup and salad.   I also like that it's super clean and modern looking inside, unlike the typical Yonge St sketchy looking spots.  My verdict - nothing special but nothing to complain about either."}
{"text":"This is a great little place, with great food. A very good selection of Bento, and Sushi that is served fresh and fast. The take out is as good as the eat in. The prices are very good for what you get.  The only bad thing that I have to say about this place, is that it is cash only. They do have an ATM or there is a bank close by. Would not keep me or should not keep you from this place.  Your first visit will not be your last!"}
{"text":"Cheap lunch specials but the spicy salmon roll is spicy and bland at the same time if that makes sense. And that's not a good thing. The salad is one sour mess as well. I also got the korean style noodle special- an even  bigger mistake. I swear they just opened up an instant noodle packet, shredded a quarter of a carrot and a cucumber and called it a korean style noodle special. Huge ripoff. The only reason this place doesn't get 1 star is because the lunch specials ARE cheap and the waitress was nice."}
