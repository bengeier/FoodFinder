{"text":"Wonderful home cooking. Great place to eat. I will have to go back to try the squash. Sevice was friendly, food was perfect. Southern hospitality at it's best."}
{"text":"Great Breakfast skip the biscuits get toast"}
{"text":"This place has some good food when available! Fried flounder is pretty good but no choice of sides to compliment it! I have tried several items on the menu and most are bland. Squash was supposed to be fresh from his farm but not so after talking with waitress! Burgers are ok but not fresh ground, same meat we buy at local super market. The menu says repeatedly that every thing is fresh but the waitress informed me that most food is frozen! The owners daughter was constantly complaining about customers who complained about food and wait times, Out Loud! Most items on menu were not available, I.e. Daily specials. The only fresh vegetable is squash and it was not local but instead out of Florida! I feel they could work with local farmers and offer a great selection of products since there are lots of small farmers around the area! Fresh my farm is their slogan but it is far from that since they don't grow it, nor does any farm around for that matter! I hope the best for this restaurant but the owners have to open their eyes and start cooking great local food."}
{"text":"Had the flounder.  Fish was delish!  Coating was crisp, not greasy and fish was flaky.  Decided on fried okra for a side and the same crisp but not greasy.  I will be returning here."}
