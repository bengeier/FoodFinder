{"text":"An European foods grocery store/deli with prepared food counter in the back.    I popped in for a Schnitzel lunch.  The pork schnitzel was a bit dry and crunchy, with a brown gravy on top.  I took some yellow potato salad and coleslaw as sides.  Nothing really exciting to write about this, but the place is charming, and they stock Haribo gummy bears."}
{"text":"Yeah good stuff here for sure.  Take out lunch is solid and good but not for foodies really.  For European buyers, pantry, smoked meats, sausages and butchery is super clean and sure to please.  Nice slice of Europe in scarborough."}
{"text":"We entered the grocery store and were pleasantly surprised to find authentic German food that is extremely hard to find anywhere. They sold traditional spaetzle, sausage and red cabbage. They also have a little deli in the back where we enjoyed rouladen and semmelknodle. My husband is from Germany and he says that it's like a little piece of home!"}
{"text":"Butchers are becoming a thing of the past, what with most people preferring to get their food pre-packaged. But those in the know know that if you want something better, you need to get it from a better place, and Vienna Fine Foods is one of those places. This is a German style butcher, complete with the hot table in the back. They make killer schnitzel there, complete with the potatoes and red cabbage. Up front, there is a delicious selection of prime quality meats and some prepared foods. Try the kaiserfleisch, no wait, leave some for me. The sausages are gluten free, the bacon is wonderfully smoky, and there is a great selection of sweets to choose from after you've stocked up on the meats and breads. Love it!"}
{"text":"Wow... hidden gem here. I've lived in Scarborough/North York my whole life and not known about this place. A friend brought me and man am I happy.   Schnitzel sandwich is light and crisp and seasoned perfectly; the bread is fresh.  I had the Spaetzle  as well - delicious.  All for a fair price."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall that you would never land on unless you work in the area. They have a nice choice of cheese, sausage, and European goodies (i.e. chocolate, cracker, snacks, jams, etc). The best part of this place is not the groceries, it is their hot food /takeaway. Great place for lunch, especially their schnitzel sandwich, coleslaw and awesome sauerkraut. From a cost perspective, totally affordable with great value.  I don't like to use 5 stars but for what it is worth, awesome."}
{"text":"I definitely find the trek to this store so worthwhile as they carry the best potato salad I have every had.  You can taste the chunks of potato and what makes it different is that there is definitely an extra kick to it that just puts it above any other that I have had.  I usually load up with two huge containers and in our house it goes pretty quickly.  They also have a wide selection of deli meats and sausages that are wonderful.  I also stock up on marzipan chocolates and sweets such as the eucalyptus mint drops for sore throats.  The people here are usually very friendly and have even given my daughter samples of deli meat and lollipops just for tagging along.  I definitely would recommend this place if you are looking for some sides and deli meat.  They do carry a wide assortment of jams as well."}
{"text":"This place has been around for at least 20 years, maybe longer.   I've known the place since I was a child.  It is one of the very few places where you can easily get tubs of sauerkraut, bratwurst, knackwurst, weisswurst and all the wursts you can imagine.  This is the secret grocery store where your oma gets all the weird stuff in her kitchen.  Expect the staff to speak German.  The low ratings here seem to be for the lunch counter.    It is very popular with East-end Toronto elderly Europeans and tradespeople on lunch breaks, but it really is just a counter and a few tables at the back of the store.  The food is cheap, filling and fast.  I'm not rating them on that.  I'm giving this place 5/5 as a specialty grocery store and one-of-a-kind uber-authentic place in the East end.  They don't take credit cards, but they do take debit.... exactly like Europe."}
{"text":"Wunderbar German Shop =D. There is a large deli counter and a cafe and hot table in the back. This shop has everything you would need in terms of German groceries plus they have health and body care products too. The hot table food is delicious and such a great deal for a complete dinner. The Christmas Market is so cute and well stocked and a must have annual shopping experience."}
{"text":"Best schnitzel in town! They drop it into the oil when you order. Always hot and crispy.  The staff are very friendly. Everything served at the back is tasty. The deli has hot dogs that have the 'snap'. We love their bacon. The Berliners (filled doughnut) are always a favourite. I prefer raspberry over plum. They're often sold out on Saturdays if you don't get there early."}
{"text":"Hidden gem it is! Wow. It's my first time around this area and the nice lady in line recommended me the Schnitzel sandwich (which everyone comes here for) with coleslaw and potato salad and it was definitely a hit!   YUM! Hands down the best Schnitzel I've ever had. The sandwich was so tasty and the potato salad was exquisite.  I almost considered ordering seconds (lol) Price was cheap too!   I decided to order some more for dinner. Will update later with reviews for goulache stew and dumplings and sauerkraut."}
