{"text":"After driving past their sign several times we decided to order it. Take out that is.

Just like another reviewer said, we were led on by the $1 sushi. Too bad it wasn't that good. I love my sashimi and nigiri and this was paper thin, I would have rather spent the extra .50 and got a nice slice of nigiri. 

The rolls were okay, but overall it wasn't worth it for us."}
{"text":"The $1 sushi is a great price for what you get and the staff is always cheery and friendly! The sushi is really good when you consider what you are paying."}
{"text":"Once again, I have been fooled by other people's review from the internet.  The place is very petite.
I think the reason why people give it so many stars is because of the $1 nigiri.  I know, $1 nigiri caught your interest right?  Ours too!

This place isn't as bad as Sushi King.  Of course, the quality of the sashimi isn't going to reach standard, but for $1 it's alright.

We tried the beef tataki, dislike.  The beef was thick and chewy, the sauce tasted more like a viet dressing, with carrots and fish oil and other marinate.  It was rather spicy too, definitely would not recommend.  

For the sushi, we had salmon, white tuna, unagi, tai, saba, cajun shrimp, and creamy scallop.
For rolls, we had a mango roll, spicy tuna, and tempera scallop.

The creamy scallop went bad.  If you eat the whole sushi at once, you won't be able to taste it.  But if you eat the scallop by itself first, you can definitely taste that the scallop went bad.  

There's alfalfa in the spicy tuna, if you don't like alfalfa, you won't like this roll.  The alfalfa is quite strong in this roll, but i like it.  

Overall, it was alright.  It's a fix for your sushi craving.
I think the mango roll was the best roll out of the 3.  There is cream cheese in the roll, but I would definitely recommend it if you go.

Our total was around $55-$60 for the two of us, but we weren't really full.

{"text":"We have only been here twice but overall we think the sushi is great for the price. At $1/ pc it's pretty darned good. But the rolls are all about regular price. The prices of the other items like gyoza and tempura seems steep, but maybe they need to make up the price if the sushi somewhere. 

It's only a tiny restaurant that would only seat 26 at full capacity. But whenever we go it's not at all busy, probably only because no one really knows it's here. A lot of people order their food as take- away. 

I had the caterpillar roll (amongst others) with tempura shrimp with fish roe and spicy mayo with sliced avocado on top. I loved it the most it was excellent. My fianc√© eats mostly nigiri and loved everything. His fav is tuna and mackerel. 

I'm not sure why the last person gave such a bad review but we think this sushi bar is an amazing little gem in Killarney and we hope more people check it out. The only drawback is its location. Right next to the corner of busy and under construction 17th av and 37th St SW there is very little parking in the back and a tiny bit of street parking on the east side of 37th st. 

Kudos to the chef. You can really tell he knows how to make his sushi!"}

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

If you're craving sushi and you're in the area, I recommed you stop by Amici Sushi for their $1.00 sushi/sashimi. For the price, the fish was decent quality and the sashimi pieces were fairly large. Can't really complain for $1.00. 

*Note* A few of my friends and I went on a Sunday in the late afternoon. We were pretty much the only people there so the food came out fairly fast and I tend to find that the sushi pieces are a bit more generous. Thus, I recommend going when it is less busy (not during the dinner rush) for fast service and to get the most out of the $1.00 sushi. 

Although it looks a little ghetto from the outside (with signs plastered on the windows and metal bars), inside is a modern Japanese restaurant where you can view the chef carefully preparing your sushi. It's a fairly small \"Mom and pops\" esq restaurant that seats around 10-15 people. Their $1.00 menu consists of your typical Nigiri sushi (about 22 choices). They have other sushi rolls and hand cones ranging from $3-$9 (typical prices); shrimp and yam tempura ($9.90); tataki (~$10); soups and sashimi salads. 

We tried a bit of everything on their $1.00 sushi menu, tempura, and baked oysters ($5.90). Most of the sushi was good except for the Gyu (raw beef strip loin) which was bland, thick, and tough to chew; the Cajun Style Prawn sushi (prawn, mayo, cayenne pepper) which had an odd taste; and we were unfortunate to eat tuna that was still frozen (because they didn't have enough to fill our order at the time). The tempura was crisp, but it was thickly battered which was a turnoff for me. Unless you love eating globs of mayo and cheese, don't get the baked oysters! The salmon was my most favourite and the pieces were bountiful!

Overall, the sushi is decent; don't expect anything too outrageously good."}
{"text":"Amici Sushi has quickly become my favorite sushi destination in Calgary. The intimate, comfortable restaurant is run by friendly staff who are always ready with a cup of steaming genmaicha. While other places in the city are touted as great, I've yet to come across a sushi restaurant that's as consistently good as Amici.
While $1 nigiri might draw some newcomers in, I keep coming back because every time I do, it's just as tasty as the last trip. The chef is great about making substitutions if requested, and the fish is always fresh. This is one of the few places in Calgary where I've always found fresh, delicious mackerel and scallops - two dishes that are frequently off-putting at most other restaurants I've been to.
The dishes - both cooked and raw - are reasonably priced, and the menu offers all the sushi standbys. What it lacks in size and notoriety, it more than makes up for in service and quality."}
{"text":"As far as suchi in Calgary goes, Amici isn't half bad. I very much enjoy the sushi here - it isn't perfect, but for the price it's definitely worth a visit. I've never eaten in, always take-out, but they're very nice and offer me tea/water while I'm waiting. 

The interior is small but nice and inviting.

They have $1 sushi specials, and free delivery within the area (also something I haven't taken advantage of).

I will keep coming back to this location - will make sure to eat in sometime soon!"}
