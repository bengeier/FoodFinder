{"text":"I thought the decor and theming was cute. The food was okay (albeit overpriced).. ignoring the fact that I noticed a bug crawling in my salad towards the end of my meal. The staff weren't accommodating or even apologetic about this. It was my fault apparently for not expecting creepy crawlers in my meal from the start, and eating most of the salad before I noticed the bug. All I got was a measly 3 dollar discount for food that shouldn't have cost that much in the first place. The location of this place is pretty convenient, but I'm never going back there again."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other night before a Jays game and honestly I'd recommend this place to anyone coming for a pregame drink or meal or any other occasion really. Despite the place being packed we received quick and truly genuine service. We got the happy hour special so the beer was cold and cheap and paired nicely with my prime rib stuffed Yorkie. Would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"Went here before a concert at the ACC.  Good food and quick service.  Waitress was great and very attentive.  Good selection of beers as well."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best.  Portions were quite small and the prices were a bit high for what you were getting. Table of 3, ordered the bangers and mash, a burger, and the sheppards pie. The bangers and mash wasn't very filling, the burger was dry, and the pie was unspectacular. The only good thing were the fat fries. For  almost 60 bucks, we expected better."}
{"text":"Average place with a nice selection beers. Good for lunch for a late night drink."}
{"text":"Came here during Caribana weekend after a drunk woman recommended it to us. Our server was amazing. She was very patient with us and did an excellent job.  We order 2 pitchers of sangria which turned out to be very bland. It tasted like juice and we left without feeling even a buzz. I would not recommend it at all.  The food was also okay. The server recommended the turkey burger to me. It wasn't the best turkey burger of my life. I could have done without it. One friend got the fish and chips which smelled great was just okay. Overall it was okay and I wasn't very impressed with the food or drink."}
{"text":"This place is definitely victim to the lunchtime rush--we got here at 12:30 and had to wait for a table, but by the time we left an hour later, there were only three other people in the room.  Food is okay.  Excellent fries.  Had the steak, which was a bit tough, but reasonably so given the price.  The room is far too loud when it's full, though.  It's not a soothing pub atmosphere at all; more like a train station in rush hour.  $4 drinks made up for a lot of that, though."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and restaurant was very pleasant, but as soon as we were seated it was unwelcoming to say the least. We were greeted by the most obnoxious waitress and left us unattended for long periods of time. The beer selection was pretty decent and the food was fantastic, customer service ruined it for me!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and underwhelming. Nothin impressive about this place. If not for the convenience factor and lack of competition I wouldn't bother."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly. Food was okay. Beer selection was good. We went on a very busy night (Bon Jovi was in town) & we got a beer before the concert & grabbed a bite to eat. I had the Mac n Cheese & my husband had the chicken & Brie sandwich. The side salad I had was better than the Mac n cheese. All & all good location when going to event at the center but not a place to go & actually have a nice, good meal. Would go back for the beer, vibe & location."}
{"text":"Some of the worst tasting food I've ever had.  Brisket Burger and fries at a high cost of 13.95   The Burger was a peppery patty overcooked. The steak fries were salty as heck its like they dissolve salt into the fryer. So disappointed I asked for a side salad. Man they can't do that right either.  Don't come here to eat. Its really, really bad.  Service was equally terrible imagine waiting 12 minutes just to pay and leave. And not seeing your waiter for 10 minutes at a time. You better have nothing better to do with your time if you decide to come here.."}
{"text":"Good but quiet pub, nice patio and delicious fish tacos!"}
{"text":"I completely agree with others about the service being hit and miss. You get ignored for awhile then over attended by the time you're ready to roll out. There's never a host at the front to greet anyone so you walk around to find a table and then get told its reserved. Here's a tip - hire someone to actually work at the host stand you have!  Drinks are way over priced. $9 for a Cesar?? Beer selection is decent so I suppose if you can catch some deals at happy hour not a bad place to come for a couple of drinks. But steer clear of the food! Not impressed at all. Beef sliders are little more than mediocre cuts of meat in a soft bun with nothing else that would provide even a hint of flavour. No sauce, no spice just meat in a bun. A pub with no malt vinegar or even a vinegar bottle for the fish and chips - really??  Place has the potential to be good given the location and interior space but honestly with the competition in the area and new tavern opening up right next door, these guys better get their act together!"}
{"text":"I never complain about food but this place served us crap... that is after we had to remind them of our order twice. I complained about my food to the manager and he actually told me I was never welcome in the restaurant again.  Basically what everyone else here has said: food sucks, staff is very rude and unprofessional. There is no reason to go to this place (it's tiny as well) as there is a better, larger, cheaper pub literally next door.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"mediocre over priced menu and most dull and boring interior design. Surprised this place still hasnt gone under.. Definitely a nono"}
{"text":"Pretty standard pub food with a slightly better beer selection than similar places nearby (although that bar is quite low). I come here quite often for a quick bite or a few beers after work but it's driven by lack of better options more than a specific preference for the place. Nothing on the menu stands out in particular but if you find yourself on Bay Street south of union station and in a rush for dinner/a drink, this is your best option."}
{"text":"Very bad experience, the waiter is so rude that I think those waiters and waitresses are waiting for us to serve them!"}
{"text":"I hadn't checked the reviews prior to coming here, however I will say it's pretty awesome place to eat. We were a group of seven and came during a busy time. They took a little extra time on my dish (Shepard's pie) which tasted amazing. They took care of the bill on my Shepard's pie and Pepsi for the trouble. The manager's name is Colin. Colin if you're reading this, you and your staff did well, thank you for such a great experience. Went above and beyond, and I'll be sure to go back.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at The Fox on our way home from a sunny Saturday afternoon on Centre Island. Despite not being very busy, the service was very slow, with a number of different servers visiting our table and not knowing that others had already recently been by. They had absolutely no kids menu, which is somewhat understandable for a pub, but we weren't warned that the servings are massive, so we ended up with way too much food, and it wasn't very good. My wife and I both got the \"exclusive\" smoked meat sandwich, and one came with the meat shredded, the other sliced. Odd to be inconsistent between two plates, side by side. Slow service, passable and somewhat overpriced food (because of the central location only, I presume). Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Pretty large, popular pub before Leafs games (or I suppose anything sports including the Jays).  I arrived on a Friday evening around 6 and got one of the few two-seaters left.    Very interesting 'nacho stack.'  They come served almost pizza-like, with large round tostada style nachos, loaded with tons of toppings, then sliced with a pizza slicer.  It makes quite a mess, but it's kind of fun.  Guess my main complaint was that there was too much for topping and I ran out of chip. Comes with pulled pork normally & chicken chili but they offered it on the side for splitting amongst two people, when one is vegetarian.  I hear their wings are pretty good but will have to take their word for it.  Some very interesting and expensive cocktails offered, but I just had the Coors Lite pint.    Standard prices.  Standard service.   Standard overall for me.  I'd go back if people wanted, but there was nothing special enough about it where I'd suggest it."}
{"text":"I like this place. I've been here a number of times for lunch and also visited here during a pub crawl on st patty's. I really like the spicy fish sandwich. I must be honest and say my colleagues often say they don't enjoy their food. I find the service very friendly and it's nice they have a patio (though it faces the gardener and a parking lot sooo ambiance isn't amazing."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at The Fox while visiting the Harbourfront.  We felt the prices were reasonable for Toronto.  The server was attentive initially.  The food came quickly unfortunately the food was only adequate.  My husband had a bacon cheeseburger that was gray inside, no juice at all.  We enjoy burgers that are juicy.  I ordered the three cheese bread.  The bread came in a small cast iron pan.  The way bread was plated was very appealing, but the bland taste was not.   The server offered to give me something else, but we didn't have time to wait for another dish.  The service was good, but felt we wasted our hard earned money on only adequate tasting food."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a pint and some pub food and the Fox was close so we stopped by.  They had a lot of interesting beers on the menu but unfortunately they were out of a lot of them (you don't stock up on beer on weekends??).  After ordering my beer, I looked at the menu. First thing I noticed is that The Fox is way over priced for pub food. There is nothing special about their menu, yet it's easily 20 - 30% more for food than most places in TO. Perhaps they cater more to the Bay St. crowd (I did see a guy in a shiny silver suit...).  I almost decided to drink my pint and walk up Yonge street to find something more reasonable but we were hungry and lazy and so we ordered anyways.  I saw a guy order the French Onion soup and the peer pressure made me order it too. It was served a little tepid for my taste, although it tasted fine.  Next I tried the lobster dip. It wasn't really what I was expecting and I didn't really like it. It looked more like flaked tuna smothered in cheese and didn't taste much better.  Finally, after having been disappointed on two counts, I ordered the nachos based on other reviews. The presentation is quite original. They layer BBQ pork, chicken, guacamole, sour creme, cheese, etc... on hand sized crispy tortillas, sort of like a nacho-style club sandwich, and then cut it up into four for you. The BBQ pork was tasty but the whole thing a pain in the ass to eat and in the end didn't really fulfill my nacho craving (sometimes you just want a big pile of regular nachos with all the trimmings).  The medicore food and the steep prices are what make me give this place a big MEH... Don't bother with this place, there are so many other pubs downtown that are WAY WAY better and cheaper."}
{"text":"We came here for the happy hour (some drinks at 4$ and bar appetizers are half price). The Setup is nice with huge bar and lots of seating. The Staff needs a lot of refinement though and seems green. There were periods of being completely ignored and then over attention. We asked for the password to WiFi and no one could figure out what it was and neither whether they show UFC question was answered.  Anyway for the apps we had the grilled oyster and drummies (chicken drumstick in BBQ sauce) Oysters were OK nothing special and I wouldn't have been happy paying for the  Drumsticks though recommended by the bartender were just bland. For the drinks they were OK and I enjoyed my red wine the white was very ho-hum.   This quite a competitive area and the fresh place thing my get this going for little bit but they will have a tough time ahead if they don't shape up."}
{"text":"One of the worst burgers I've had in my life, period. I don't know if it was because I visited during their first week, but that burger was just an overpriced disaster that kept disintegrating in my hands."}
{"text":"I went to The Fox about a week after it opened, brought in by a $15 discount coupon. The pub had an opening special on with $3.99 domestic beer/drinks. The music was quiet, and a couple of the tables were VERY loud (at 7 on a Friday).  The menu is small, about 10 items or so. I had the \"turdukin curry\" ($22). The duck was a little bland, the naan bread was burnt. Otherwise it was pretty good. However, my meal was not better than the curries available at other bars in the area for $12-14. My date had the burger, which she enjoyed.  Overall - small menu with average tasting but expensive food. Not worth visiting."}
{"text":"Wow, I did not have a chance to Yelp this before I went in, but it was close to the Westin Harbour Hotel, so it was either this or Miller's. This place had more craft beers. It looks like a regular bar with a lot of TVs, but I was pleasantly surprised with the food. I ordered the fish tacos which I thought were great. The beer choices were great as well. My wife ordered the ribs and they were not so great. She did not think they had much taste which they didn't. The service was very good and also to my surprise was one TV was dedicated to the Emmys for my wife and I had all the other TVs to watch football."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a recent vacation stop.  Loved it!  It wasn't crowded.  The staff was super friendly and helpful and the food was great and prices were reasonable.  They never rushed us either.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went with my mom, after walking a few blocks to find some good food to satisfy my carnivore like appetite. We went into The Fox. It had a very \"man cave\" like feeling. The girls had to wear uniforms thats consisted of a tight polo shirt and a short(short short shoooort) plaid skirt. The sports network was playing and the dining area was right next to the bar.  It wasn't the cleanliness of all places i've seen. But I did like that it was neutral colours mostly on the walls and decor.  For the food I ordered riblets and my mom ordered a burger. The burgers were great. The riblets was a lot for a good price, however- I got sick after eating them.  Keep that in mind.  Our food came a bit late it seems but I'm not going to be picky on the time it comes. Our server seemed a bit annoyed at us. When we asked for more time after we got our drinks she seemed bothered. The majority of the servers if not all(I think all) were blond females. They weren't that friendly however, the bus boy(I think he was it, sorry I don't know exactly his status) was EXTREMELY nice to us.   Pretty lame overall- the bus boy made it a bit better for me, he was a cool brotha. *On another note, when we entered the manager greeted us and when my mother asked,\"You swerve food right?\" (The sign said bar outside and it looked like a bar exactly so it was unsure) He gave her a patronizing look and a sarcastic sentence.  won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Walked into the bar to meet some of my coworkers to have some drinks and as I was walking in I was already disappointed.  A bunch of us, girls, walked in and were not greeted by any of the hostesses even though there were at least two standing by the door.  We ended up walking through the bar ourselves and found our friend and were just about to sit down but we ended up switching to a booth seat as we had a larger than expected group of people.  We sat down and were greeted by our waitress whom did not introduce herself but asked us right away if we would like anything to drink, she quickly let us know the special beer on tap and said she'd give us a minute and get back to us. After waiting for a couple minutes, she came back and asked us what we'd like. I decided on the Spinach and 3 Cheese Dip and the others ordered Chicken Fingers and Fries, Fish and Chips, a Cobb Salad and a Chicken Parmesan Sandwich.  After ordering our food, we did not get an opportunity to order drinks and the next time she came around to take our orders, they were already out of their special beer on tap.  We then had to look through the menu again and decide on another beer.  Throughout the night, I found that our waitress was no where to be seen from time to time and if she was around she had no patience with us.  I also found her to be extremely rude and somewhat felt she's been in the service industry for a very long time to the point where she didn't seem to care to give good customer service.  I don't even know where to start with the food, after looking at the menu I felt everything was overpriced for the type of pub food that they offered.  We got our Chicken Fingers which looked more like Chicken Filets and my coworkers Chicken Parmesan was the exact same Chicken Filets with the bun bigger than her head.  The Fish and Chips were apparently really greasy and the fries were soggy.  The Cobb Salad had no presentation and was pretty much a bunch of vegetables, chunks of cheddar cheese, bacon bits, and some chunks of avacado plopped onto a massive plate with romaine lettuce.  My Spinach Dip to sum it up nicely, was a bunch of spinach baked into a platter with no cheese, whatsoever.  The beer on the otherhand, was the only upside to this restaurant because they had a wide variety of beers and they were cheap.  The ambience of The Fox was your typical pub, similar to Jack Astors and they had girls that were dressed like they worked at the Tilted Kilt.  After all that, I didn't even want to tip the waitress and I am not coming back here and would never recommend this restaurant to anyone.  What did the Fox say?? Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho!"}
{"text":"These Nachos are out of this world. They layer one the toppings.. Every bite has either cheese or topping. (not just on the top, like the other places) Pulled pork,  chilli chicken,  guacamole,  sour cream. Dear Fox,  you've impressed me.. :)"}
{"text":"Had dinner before a leafs game, was definitely expensive but good quality food and decent priced beer. The Calamari was possibly some of the best I have had anywhere in the city but in the end the hipster atmosphere was a little to much for me. The staff was nice, our server was ok, they were busy so i dont blame her for passing over us a few times while waiting for the bill. All in all I would def go back for the calamari."}
{"text":"The fox is a solid but not spectacular choice for a casual dinner. Service is friendly and prompt even on a surprisingly busy Tuesday night. Most of the menu items are a bit pricier that other pubs by a few $ and the drinks are not cheap. I had the pulled pork sandwhich with fries, and was quite happy with the pork which was the right amount of saucy and came in a good size portion. The fries were nothing special, and a couple of other dishes including the fish and chips looked small. I will likely return as it's a convenient location and seems like a reliable dinner option."}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriends. Nice place. It wasn't busy but the food took long time to arrive. Nice atmosphere. The fish tacos and the pulled pork tacos were very good."}
{"text":"We went with a large corporate group the staff were accommodating the portions were generous and the service was excellent. Rob the bartender is a wealth of knowledge and an excellent server."}
{"text":"Pouting is not bad but chose the pork instead of the fox ... Steak wasn't bad ... Asked for medium get a rare ... Bear choice is good."}
{"text":"Excellent prices (for the summer drinks), however the drinks are lacking. The \"Sangria\" was pretty garbage. On top of that, you can taste the plastic within the drink (because the sangrias are supposedly on tap).  Food seemed ridiculously over priced.  WAY better bars in way better neighbourhoods 10 min away."}
{"text":"It's called The Fox, so how could a kitsune to not check it out. It has a friendly atmosphere you would expect from a sports bar. Lively, vibrant, great placement of TVs, you can hear what's on even through the noise. Comfy chairs and tables, tasty food, polite staff, great service. What can I add? Go Leafs, go!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite to eat with my mom and friend. We sat on the patio which was nice and were seated and served right away by a very nice friendly waitress. We ordered nachoes to share which had pulled pork, chicken, cheese, all the usual yummy additions and it was delicious! I don't usually like meat on nachoes but this was excellent.  I ordered fish and chips for my main and it was tasty. Not overly big portion, but just enough. My mom ordered the bacon cheeseburger and she said it was very good! (Looked great) The menu is very small (On the patio) and limited only a handful of options-but we were very happy with our food and service. I will come back :)"}
{"text":"I really like their drink specials in the afternoon, especially add the second shot for a dollar. I also tried their pulled pork fried as well, it was salty and I didn't like it much.  The location is good, right down the waterfront and surrounded by many office buildings."}
{"text":"Kodos for the convenience of the closeness to the air Canada center and parking in the downtown entertainment district. Arrive early to enjoy happy hour from 2 -6 and some quick eats. Friendly place with quick service. Servers friendly and attentive. Food was just ok but you can't go wrong with the chicken fingers and fries. Nothing special with the food but beer is cold and a variety on tap."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Very cozy. Pretty good beer selection. We had dinner and food was good, if nothing more than typical pub grub. Prices were reasonable and service was excellent. Good place for an intimate conversation."}
{"text":"Hmmm, no thank you. I don't want to return.   Overpriced, overcooked, reheated stuff, and not very good tasting.   I got the burger with fat fries. The cheese was a thin layer of melted orange square almost transparent on my burger. It didn't look appetizing and it sure didn't taste good. Burger lacked flavour. It was just a stomach stuffer. But I wouldn't pay this much to stuff my stomach. I'd rather go to McDonalds and be happy.   Rest of my party had Philly Cheese Steak Taco, Nacho Stack, Curry Chicken with Rice and Naan, Tomato and Chick Pea Soup, and Angel Hair Pesto with Shrimp.   Typical response \"it's okay......................\" which decoded means \"It's edible and I'm not going to be hungry for the next 4 hours, but when I think about the price I'm paying, we should've gone to McDonald's instead. Whose idea was this anyways?!?!\"  I guess it wouldn't be so bad if we just came here for happy hour beer. You can't really go wrong with cheap beer and cheap snacks. But for a dinner, I'd hop elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nice bar with good selection of draft beer across from ACC"}
{"text":"Quick to fix a problem, great management team. Staff is very friendly, and knows what there doing. Great place to go any night. Food is amazing, nachos are to die for!"}
{"text":"Adding the word \"gastro\" to anything doesn't help. There - I've said it. Sorry but the trend just needs to stop. Aside from the vague association with violent viral outbursts, this place doesn't have much going on. Staff seem uninspired and bored with their clientele, who for the most part are likely tourists. I shared a plate of nachos (the only menu item specifically mentioned in the tips on Yelp) and it was decent, albeit not great.   It's not terrible but that's not enough to win in this game."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at The Fox.  It's been a few years since we've been there.  It was busy with fans leaving the Toronto Blue Jays game and fans heading to the Toronto Rock game.  They had fun signs around the pub.  We both ordered a beer and they came in big big glasses.  We ordered wings.  Gord got his plain and I got mine with Honey Garlic sauce.  Though the wings were good, they were small and there were 10 to an order.  At $16.95, they were way overpriced as they were teeny tiny.  We were still hungry so ordered Cheese Garlic Bread and it was good ... soft on the inside and chewy on the outside.  We'd go back for drinks but not for food ... it's way overpriced."}
{"text":"Decent. Not sure I understand the thinking of having The Fox, and Miller Tavern right next to each other. Service was iffy. The main server for our table kinda flaked, it was another server who got us our drinks, and check on us after food delivery.  Food was okay, nothing exciting.  If i am in the area before a game or concert at ACC, i'd rather go to Real Sports."}
{"text":"Woah! The recent reviews are rough!  It seems to me that it has a lot to do with what time you visit this place. I visited this place at 3pm on a Saturday when it was quite empty. This factor could very well be why I had such a decent experience.   The service was really friendly and super attentive. Our server made not-too-cheesy jokes and helped us with recommendations. There was a bit of an error in the order, but they fixed it immediately and apologized profusely.   The food tasted really good! Everyone enjoyed their dishes, and certainly my pulled pork sliders really hit the spot. It was also a bit spicy which seems to be a rarity in pub joints like these. Everything was on the more expensive side for a pub, but since it's in the harbourfront area, I wasn't particularly surprised.   To be honest I think a lot of people will come into this place and find t to be an essentially unremarkable experience. With so many options in Toronto, this place may have to bring in something new to help define it a bit more. With the Miller pub next door and hockey games being a winter occasion, I have to wonder how they competively fare. Despite what some of the reviews say, I think they have a lot going for them (decent service and tasty food)."}
{"text":"He had a great time because we had a great server we had fantastic calamari the bathroom had funny signs and the best burger. Amazing key lime pie and right across the street from the air canada centre"}
{"text":"Tourist trap alert..!! Literally the only people who go here are those going to the Air Canada Centre for games or concerts. Ordered the infamous burger came blackened on one side, it was inedible. I came a second time and ordered the chicken wrap it was so tasteless, I told the server she chuckled, seem like she wasn't surprised. She took the dish back and recommend the chicken fingers instead which were OK but nothing special."}
{"text":"Pretty lame really 2.5 stars.   Food pricing is exorbitant - the Fox touts itself as a \"Gastropub\" but basically this just means higher food prices on regular pub fare with fancy sounding names on the menu. We heard the table next to us complaining about the horrible burgers and quesadilla they ordered, so we avoided partaking.   They do have a decent patio and some nice prices on \"Summer Drinks\" - $5.30 for a glass of house wine or sangria, marguarita, daquiri, shooters and several beers.  Our waiter was a nice Saffa fella and we didn't experience any issues with the service."}
{"text":"We wen for lunch. It wasn't busy so the fact our service was not good is inexcusable. Our waitress was nice, just not good at her job. We asked for silverware four times...and again after our food arrived and gave up and took it off another table. I got a soup and salad and it cost me $26 which is crazy. The salad was bigger than a starter salad but not close to entree size and they were charging entree size prices. The soup came out cold and last, she forgot my bread and brought it out when I was 80% done and still charged me for it. The only thing this place has going for it is location. I would say you are better off grabbing something to go at the nearby coffee shop than wasting your money here"}
{"text":"The Fox is a newly opened pub down at Bay Street and Queen Quay.   Grand Opening Specials $3.99 for a selections of beers, wine and drinks which is a great price and good value. (+0.5)  Happy Hour bar snacks 50% off got me here but they were so disappointing! There are only 4 items for us to pick from that consider a \"Bar Snack\".   The chicken drummies with BBQ sauce we ordered for $6 with the specials were pathetic and tasteless! I would not even getting it again ever...if I would have pay $12 for those, I would be really really upset! I don't think I really want to order any food at all from the Fox because the kitchen really failed to deliver! (-0.5)  Services were hit and miss. A lot of the staffs doesn't know what's going on.. The bartender just started working today, so she didn't realized that's a Grand Opening Specials nor the Happy Hour Specials. Nor she knows about the Wifi password.... (Wifi was not working probably as I couldn't sign in and no one working there really care or know why!) (-0.5) . The decoration was really chic and modern compared to other pubs.   Since The Fox is having the drinks specials, the place was pretty packed with the after work crowds.. $4 a drink is quite a good deal.. but I don't know what's going to happen when the Grand Opening Specials is over."}
{"text":"Great afterwork snacky dinner on the patio. Good gluten free options as well for those with celiac. We recently moved in around the corner and wanted to try out something close."}
{"text":"the good: Decor is okay inside, beer list is okay, patio looks ok (although your view is just of busy construction/Lakeshore Blvd.  the bad: Service was pretty terrible, blank expression server who barely said anything.  Food though: BAD, like wow.  First got the Chicken Curry - completely flavourless and small portion of actual chicken and naan.  It tasted like President's Choice Microwave Butter Chicken (seriously if you've ever had that it tastes the exact same), that is $3.50 at a Loblaws, at The Fox it was $16.  Sent it back (honestly rare for me to do that but it was crap) and got a burger and fries.  Bland.  Fries were meh, like McCains fries. Burger bun was soggy and sunk in like foam.    My two companions had equally blah food compared to them.  Boring unfilling chicken quesadilla, etc.  I'd only go back if I wasn't hungry and just wanted to drink a pint and watch the game and didn't care about meh food and service."}
