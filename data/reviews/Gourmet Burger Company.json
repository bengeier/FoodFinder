{"text":"This place has awesome quality meat for the burgers - fresh, loosely formed, and never over cooked (unlike big smoke burgers which is horrendously overrated). Much better poutine than smokes next door with actual beef based gravy. Surprisingly outstanding fish burgers. Thick milkshakes. And onion rings so I good I cannot help but scarf them down immediately, and I don't even like onion rings.  It's not as good as the holy Burger's Priest, but it beats every other chain in the city by a longshot and I eat here once a week since its opened on Adelaide."}
{"text":"Visited the outlet in the Financial District.  Tried the pork pulled burger (too sweet for my liking) and my wife went for the classic burger (average).  I am told that the restaurant has a great Veggie burger, but unlikely that I would try that given my experience with the non veg burgers."}
{"text":"burger was pretty small and the entire thing was laced with grease. the bag was dripping wet. flavors were okay - nothing mind blowing. bread was decent but not a good ratio of meat and bread. patty was the worst part- no flavor and way thin compared to the bun. first time here so maybe it gets better"}
{"text":"By far the weakest of the \"gourmet burger\" options in Toronto. I've been here twice, and it's safe to say my visits were not anomalies: Dry buns, dry beef, and a very small patty for the price. Did I mention it took 20 minutes? On a Tuesday night? Won't be going back - Burrito Boyz next door is a much better buy."}
{"text":"What happened? Your burgers use to be the best around. We tried your new Angus Beef burgers which were dry, overcooked and tasteless. It was like you squeezed all the juice and flavour out of the burgers. Fries were overcooked and dry as well. I know good fries are double-fried but these were more than triple-fried. Your service is always friendly but food very disappointing this time."}
{"text":"Fully satisfied my spontaneous craving for a big juicy burger with all the fixings.
 
Pleasantly surprised I was able to get my burger on a whole wheat bun, with decent premium toppings including aged white cheddar and garlic mayo.

A word of caution though, this location gets seriously packed around lunch time. If you're in a bit of a rush I would suggest skipping the fries and you'll blaze pass the line-up of people waiting for their orders to be filled. 

Oh but the smell of fries is so hard to resist."}
{"text":"Good food.  Lots of burger options that do not disappoint.  Too bad the service was slow.  The Kipling site is now short.
There are other locations around town."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad, but wouldn't say it was gourmet...just good & quick!  Wait...but you can order a beer with your burger, so....that could be a bonus depending on your caloric intake allowance!"}
{"text":"I ended up at GBC on my lunch break because Smoke's Poutinerie and Burrito Boyz were, as usual, full. GBC appeared to be equally as busy and, as a previous review points out, there's actually enough room to accommodate a normal lunch crowd. You don't have to order something and then eat it while standing on the sidewalk or while wandering around. I was surprised at how spacious the place is, given how small many neighbouring places are.

The place is clean, the service is quick (waited about 10 minutes after ordering while 6-8 people waited ahead of me), the staff is friendly and they were pretty quick to clean the tables after people left.

For a little over $12 with tax, I got \"The Works\" burger (lettuce, tomato, sauteed mushrooms, caramelized onions, bacon, chese \"GBC\" sauce) with onion rings and a can of pop. A good price compared with other places.

The burger was fresh and juicy and cooked just right. The onion rings (about 10-12 in total) were light and crispy - not overcooked and crunchy. According to the menu, they're beer battered.

I was happy with the burger, the price and the seating capacity - GBC has been added to my list of regular lunch spots."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times now, and have been very satisfied. The burgers are tasty, and seem to be very fresh. No rubber patties! The price of the burger is priced proportionately to how many toppings you like (which seams fair to me), but many toppings are free too. While it is a bit pricey for takeout ($25+ for 2 burgers, 2 fries, and two drink), I think I would still choose this over most of the alternatives. The fries are good, the onion rings are great, the milk shakes are tasty. Overall win for the neighbourhood. 

Also - bonus points for being very clean, which is high up on the importance scale for me. 

I actually watched the manager sign out after her shift, but on her way out, which I imagine was unpaid time, she went around and tidied up some tables, pushed in chairs, etc. A manager who cares! How novel!"}
{"text":"There is a reason there is no one here!  I have been to this location one other time and it was much better. I will never go back again. Hamburgers were like sawdust. Staff was rude. not worth the price.  I can't wait for burger Priest to open on Kipling and queensway. I am sure gourmet burger will end up closing"}
{"text":"I went for lunch with 3 work colleagues today after reading the reviews on Yelp.  The place was very clean and plenty of seating which was an unexpected surprise for this area.  I ordered the Spicy Cajun Burger which came with lettuce, tomato, avocado, jalapenos, jalapeno havarti, cajun spice & smokey chipotle & honey mayo with a side of onion rings.  I didn't order a drink and my order came to just under $12 which I personally feel is a little pricey for lunch.  Overall the flavour of the burger was really good however it was slightly messy to eat.  The onion rings were fantastic, I really enjoyed them.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  One of my colleagues got the sweet potato fries and she quite enjoyed them."}
{"text":"For a franchise, the quality of the burger was definitely above Hero Burger, and even the Burger's Priest and Holy Chuck.  My boyfriend took me to Gourmet Burger Co because we had tried Holy Chuck and were disappointed by another \"McDonald's Big Mac\" tasting burger.  We ordered the Spicy Cajun burger, onion rings and a strawberry milkshake. 

The Spicy Cajun burger was dressed with lettuce, tomato, avocadoes, jalapeno peppers, Jalapeno havarti, cajun spice, Smokey chipotle and honey mayo.  The different flavours of the burger blended in so well together.  Even though the burger patty itself contained Jalopeno bits and was dressed with Jalapeno peppers, the fresh beef flavour was very distinct.  Rather than mask the beef flavour (like the other burger joints), all the dressings enhanced it.   

The milkshake was inexpensive (only $3.00) and was also very good with the freshness of the ice cream coming out.  The onion rings were not special but did not disappoint.  They were supposed to be beer battered but we didn't notice a difference in taste to non beer battered rings.

One of the best burgers I've had in a while.  It' was expensive for a fast food franchise (the entire meal was $20 for one person) Because it's a franchise, the quality may differ between locations but given my experience at this particular location, I would try out another one."}
{"text":"Terrible mushroom melt burger! I used to be a fan here, but after the reopen of this location, the mushroom is so small, that I literally cannot taste it at all! Cheese is to small, and doesn't even melt at all! From any perspective, this can not be called as mushroom melt. How the management will improve the good quality and bring it back up! Otherwise we'll never come back!"}
{"text":"I had a chance to check out Gourmet Burger Company (GBC) on a regular Wednesday afternoon for a change.  Man cannot live on weekend Yelp reviews alone!

Unlike some other lunch crowd favourites in the area, GBC actually has a dining area.  The tables and chairs are minimalist, but are comfortable enough for an hour, and the dining area is very clean.  No leftover ketchup puddles or odd coloured stains.  There are napkin dispensers readily available.  Tables aren't bolted to the floor, so they can moved around to suit the seating needs of your group, though the space is not huge.  Or, if you're alone and just want to read while noshing, there's a counter as well.  This location is still quite new, so the equipment still looks great.  Overall, a clean and pleasant place to dine.  

But you want to know about the food, right?  The menu setup at GBC is quite similar to Hero Burger - you can order a basic burger and add your own selection of toppings, condiments, and sauces.  Personally, I love the fact that SAUTEED MUSHROOMS is one of the free toppings (not the case at Hero).  Seriously.  And they have fried egg as an option!  It's not a common North American thing, but fried egg on a burger is something I discovered at an all-inclusive resort - great after a hard night of drinking.  

Anyway.  I ordered The Works with a Jones soda and fries.  The burger was moist, very juicy and had a good beefy flavour.  Maybe not as beefy as some other premium burger shops, but close.  Nevertheless, a very enjoyable burger.  The fries, unfortunately, were soggy, slightly overfried and underseasoned.  My dining partner had the chicken burger with a side salad (listed as organic on the menu, for you health nuts).  The salad looked very fresh and a step up from the normal garden salad, with dried cranberries and sunflower seeds amongst the mixed greens.  The chicken burger earned compliments for its moistness and flavour.

Overall, GBC puts out a quality product (except perhaps the fries) at a competitive price.  If you're looking for a good burger away from the food court crowds, this is definitely a decent option to consider."}
{"text":"Love this place. I come here with my family about once a week. Never had a bad experience. Great customer service, very clean atmosphere and most importantly they have fresh tasty food. Live the sweet potato fries! My toddler son loves it here too!"}
{"text":"Originally from Australia , the founder decided to hop onto the Gourmet Burger trend by introducing the brand to Canada first. 5 Toronto locations and growing. Each GBC burger is made from Canadian farm-raised beef. They prepare all their own sauces alongside the house sauce (GBC sauce) which is bbq sauce and mayo mix. 

After an episode of How I Met Your Mother (ep : The best burger in New York), I started to seriously crave for a burger. Which lead my fantastic man & I, to this little place close by.
We walked up the flight of steps and were greeted by brown and white themed walls with basic chair/table pairs. Alongside one wall there are booths. The opposite wall has the condiments section. Straight to the end is the cashier with the bright menu right up top. Pretty basic stuff right? Nope. The secret is in the details. Beer battered onion rings - seriously? 

The girl at the register was very polite and asked if it was our first time. She took us through the menu options and even had a few suggestions. I really appreciated this since there's all these extra little tidbits a consumer should know. Example : you can create your own burger with all the toppings you want. Any sauce on the side is $.50 extra. The combo (3.95) can be paired up with any burger which is cheaper than purchasing a burger alone. 
Once you order, you get a table/check number and while you are seated; they bring your food.


I created my own
GBC burger (meat) - I found the patty thinner than the usual gourmet burger but quite delicious. It was really soft and melted with everything else. For a sauce loving foodie - this is a desired burger combination. 
Toppings : 
 Jalapeño Havarti cheese - The slice was so thin I could barely taste it. Sadness. 
Roasted garlic & Dijon mustard Mayo sauce - Garlic and Mustard - My go to ingredients. I could never go wrong with either of these 2. This mayo sauce is on the sweet side and carries a lighter body than your average mayo. I couldn't taste much of the mustard but it definitely gave the rest of my toppings a nice covering.
tomato 
red onion
caramelized onions - this was a delicious surprise. The onions were wide chunks and again on the sweet side. They are marinated in Balsamic which gives it a hint of sour with the aftertaste. 


My bfs order
Spicy Cajun burger Combo. With sweet potato fries and a canned pop drink. 
GBC beef burger - The patty was as thin and I noticed how soft the buns were. They look really full but it's super soft which is awesome because I don't like the  heavy bread taste too much. Thin crust lovers unite!

Toppings:
Jalapeño Havarti cheese - This burger combination had a more dry ,salty taste. It complimented the cheese. 
Cajun spice & Smokey chipotle & honey mayo - I definitely tasted the mustard with this sauce but it went really well with the Jalapenos. 
lettuce, tomato, 
avocado
jalapeños

 Sides:
Sweet potato fries - The container was good for us to share and I could taste how fresh they were. Even though they were closing up soon, I appreciated how fresh they were. The fries weren't as dried out or thin. They were full and sweeter than I normally taste but nothing crazy. There was no side sauce so I just used regular ketchup but I bet it would've tasted damn good with any of the mayo mixes. 

For a gourmet burger joint it definitely is much more on the affordable dinner end of things
This go-green, playful set of sauces mixed with Canadian grown meat is the date place winner for me. Did I mention they have beer battered items on the menu? It's like beer ingested food without actually smelling like beer. Give this menu a medal. 
for 1 combo and 1 burger it came to $17.65 - Dinner for under $20.00

This place need not worry about startin a fire - cause i'll be the fan they require. -rap skills  - gone bad. 

Fun fact: All packaging is biodegradable or fully recyclable. They aren't in your face about it but it's nice to know that there's some conscious in the background, while you enjoy a delicious burger.

Save the world and have a burger - should be their motto.

{"text":"Overpriced so-so burgers, no gourmet in sight...
We ordered the double cheeseburgers with rings. The rings were bland and looked like they had been in the fryer for an hour.
The patties were obviously pre-cooked and quite bland. Buns here are normal Kaisers, which is a good choice, but with bill of $18 I expect something..... GOURMET! Say a Brioche or at least an Ace Bakery bun?

Service and topping choices were plentiful, but toppings are rationed so much I could barely count the toppings I had ordered, a sliver of Jalepeno, a teaspoon of caramelized onions, again for $18 where is the love.

You can find a better burger at many restaurants in the area for $12 add a beer and you're much more satisfied for you $18. Will not be back, if you're stuck in the area, there are much better choices around under a kilometer away."}
{"text":"I went to gourmet burger co once before and it was an ok experience, this review is about my second experience which ranks similarly to the first one.

what I had: I usually have a burger with bacon and sauteed onions at all burger places to have a comparable burger base, so I am comparing apples to apples. If I am hungry enough, I try to get two burgers so that I have a better, more representative, sample or burgers and ensure that  any errors in first one get eliminated in the second one.

I had smokey bacon burger,gbc saute, added pickles

analysis: So overall, the product I got to eat was a really poor tasting meal.. 8$

would I recommend this? bottom line: it was ok just to feel full for a few hours, not exactly an \"OMG so good\" place,,

1. service: service was ok, but took forever
 
2. price: 8$, which is I guess average for a \"specialty burger\". 

3. taste: the burger was very spongy, like rubber. there were actually no pickles on the burger, nor was there any sauce, and I asked for both.The bacon was barely present, and was quite soggy, with no taste whatsoever (not crispy like you get at good places).

4. portion size- was sort of average

so it is an ok place, but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"It's like a fancy semi self-serve Harvey's. You place your order at the front, pick up your drink from the fridge on the side and wait at your table until they call your order. We had the signature combos: 

- SMOKEY BACON BURGER + ONION RINGS + JONES ROOTBEER

- SPICY CANJUN BURGER + REGULAR FRIES + H2O

Both burgers were great, the beef patties were super juicy and tasted like real beef...not like the standard \"burger flavour\" you get at fast food chains. The onion rings were pretty awesome as well, my friend kept eating mine. It's probably because the regular fries SUCKED. There is nothing special about the regular fries, they are cut short with the skin on and have no particular deliciousness. 

This location is clean and because it's on the Kipling strip it's relatively quiet. When I was there on a Sunday, the other patrons were families with small (and well-behaved!) children. I'm not sure how this place is on a weekday."}
{"text":"I waited 20 minutes for them to cook a somewhat tasty beef burger patty (4 or 5oz, no more).  With the size of the burger this should be in my hands with 7-8 minutes, no more.  The cooks looked like they were going crazy back on the grill.  When I checked their menu they had only 5 different types of burgers (variations with specific topping for some to make the menu look bigger, but 5 nonetheless).  It's a burger.  Maybe I'm a little overly critical because I worked at my dad's burger joint for 20+ years, but for the quality of the burger, the size & the time I had to wait they're lucky I'm giving them two stars.  I'll give them one more shot next week."}
{"text":"Never going there again.

Walked in and order and their system was down and I did not have cash on me. I had to go to the nearest atm machine and return to pay for my meal. It wouldn't have bothered me much but they told me after I had order and they were making my food.

I ordered the burger with cheese and fries with gravy and a pop. The burger was dry as sand and the fries were terrible. Not only did they forget my gravy, they didn't have any to serve. I ended up throwing most of the meal away and left with my drink in hand. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Randomly stumbled in with my girlfriend one weekend and very glad that we did. The burgers here are amazing! The fries are a bit expensive - a bit of a let down next to the juicy awesomeness of the burger. I wish they  would make sweet potato fries... But definitely worth going just for the burgers."}
{"text":"The problem with this Gourmet Burger Co. location is that it's not one. GBC closed and this place is now a generic burger joint obviously trading on the old name/logos which have not been fully removed from the outside. It's actually called \"The Grill\"."}
{"text":"Burgers are amazing here... Love the sweet potato fries YUM!! Friendly enough... this place is pricy for a burger, it's worth it :)"}
{"text":"I came in here ravenous with a serious burger craving.  I expected that if this joint was even half as good as the reviews I read, I would leave a very happy camper.  Instead, I left very disappointed.

I'll start off with the positive: pretty much the only good thing about this place is the service.  The girl behind the counter was friendly and went out of her way to explain that they didn't do their burgers rare or medium rare, and even brought the food out to my seat.  Unfortunately what she brought out just wasn't any good.

I ordered a lamb burger with red onions, tomatoes, jalapenos and avocado.  The burger itself was thin and dry.  As any burger connoisseur knows, a good burger needs to have good condiments.  GBC's condiments were very poor.  The tomato was old and not even red, the jalapenos weren't fresh, and worst of all, the avocado was basically some kind of stale guac dip that had a strong acidic taste (that I 
hate).

I came in here thinking that GBC could do no wrong.  Sadly they managed to do just about everything wrong.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Make no mistake: this is a fast food joint. However, the food is way better here than places like Wendy's or Apache Burger (and palatable). I especially like their fries and the variety of toppings that are available for the burgers."}
{"text":"On my last night in Toronto I find this place a few streets in the opposite direction I had been exploring close to the hotel. I almost didn't walk in. At first glance I see the open sign flashing but the place looked closed but I did a double take and walked in. 

Unlike other reviews I didn't find this place slammed but I wasn't there at lunch either. For 7 PM on a Thursday night it was dead.  I was the only customer in the burger joint but was committed to seeing how great this place was or if I was going to walk away **pfffft** and regret it. 

The burger was awesome. A fresh patty beaten down to become perfection on a bun. A little salty for me but not so much it ruined the experience. I added red onions, jalapenos, lettuce, tomato, and mustard. It seemed like the right combination (and they have a lot to choose from) and the bun was definitely fresh.  

I chose the combo with onion rings. Although I usually turn down beer battered rings - these were great. Way better than most you can find in or around Austin. 

Overall - great experience (food & service)."}
{"text":"Would give it a 3.5 if I could. They have some interesting burger choices, lamb meat etc. The topping and sauces were great but the paties were a little small and overcooked for my taste, although I guess all ground meat has to be well done in Ontario. Sweet potato fries were pretty good. Nice helpful staff. Very affordable"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I had the GBC burger with cheddar. The burger was a little overdone for my taste and the fries were ok. Check mark for trying it but dont think I would come back."}
{"text":"Pretty generic.
My first surprise was how much dinner for 2 costs here... $29 incl tax. I had the cajun burger with fries and a soda, this was a combo. The burger wasn't bad but I was expecting so much more. Pretty much all the flavor came from the jalapenos and sauce, the burger itself wasn't too flavorful. The fries looked homemade but were pretty greasy. Soda was only from bottles in a cooler, no fountain soda. However, they do have steam whistle on tap. 

No big complaints, just unimpressive and not worth the price."}
{"text":"I first noticed Gourmet Burger Company while I was driving down Kipling and thought to myself, \"Hey, wasn't that place a strip club before?\".

We stopped in to grab a quick dinner - burger ($5.95) and a burger combo with fries and a drink ($10).  Food was ready not too long after ordering.  Liked that the burger was on a whole wheat bun and the fries were tasty.  

The burger was just okay...not any better than say Hero Burger, Harvey's or to a lesser extent Wendy's.  Not sure what makes these burgers 'gourmet' other than the price tag.

Dining room was pretty empty while we were there but noticed constant take out traffic.  

I took novelty in knowing that I might have been eating right where the champagne room use to be which lead me to hum this song for the rest of the night - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9yBPcn8IqU"}
{"text":"Meh. I had a smoky bacon burger with jalapenos. Toppings were nice and the meat had good flavour, but the patty was thin and dried out/overcooked to a literal crisp -- a problem compounded by the thick, dense bun. Fries looked promising but were also lifeless. Would not return, although I'm not sure where else to go for a burger given how sparse offerings in Toronto are."}
{"text":"I'm going with the crowd here, pretty darn nice for a burger joint. The fish burger was light and crispy and the fries didn't disappoint.

But guys, it's 2012, you're a franchise and you don't take American Express. Would love the option to pay as I prefer."}
{"text":"great pulled pork 
excellent poutine"}
{"text":"From a Self-Proclaimed \"Burger Snob\", The Gourmet Burger Company gets a reasonable grade.

As per my first visits to all burger joints, I ordered what they are known for; in this case, it's the Works Burger.

Great bun and seasoned patty (kind of wished the sautéed mushrooms weren't from a can and more natural). The signature GBC sauce felt quite generic and ordinary. The fries were good not great.

Overall an average burger for a pretty good price."}
