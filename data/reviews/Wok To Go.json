{"text":"First and last time ordering from this place.  Ordered General Taos Chicken and the chicken was so soggy and not crispy, the sauce was clear sauce and heavily starchy with a strong ginger flavour - not at all what General Taos typically tastes like.  The fried chicken wings had a peculiar taste and were half burnt.  The wonton soup base was brown and salty and the black pepper beef had no colour to it - the beef was not soft and flavourful.  Unfortunately no one enjoyed their meals, $50 down the drain.  Definitely would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Over 2 hours waiting for them to deliver food. This is crazy. If they were honest with me about how long it would take them I could have ordered swiss chalet and could have eaten by now. I was just about to go to McDonalds when they arrived with my food."}
{"text":"They should change the name to 'WOK away and GO someplace else\".  Lots of fatty beef and grisly chicken. Starch flavoured noodles, spongy pork. Just not good at all. My biggest mistake was not going to the KFC next door instead."}
{"text":"First time here...didnt know what to expect..Awesome food...General Tao is amazing...peanut butter sauce dumpling is wonderful!!!!
Great job..will be back for sure!!!!!"}
{"text":"Délicieux et le service était excellent, les suggestions du serveur ont sus m'éclairer afin de faire les meilleurs choix que je n'ai aucunement regrettés d'ailleurs. Les prix sont très raisonnable."}
{"text":"Ok ordered some lemon chicken jumbo shrimp Cantonese chowmain and springrolls . Its took an hour half to get to me because driver could leave fire truck was blicking driveway. I get that but the food was so greasy and barely warm they should have had driver return and make it fresh . Never again"}

I have no idea why the reviews a quite low on this. Its a decent little take out Chinese corner shop. Plus they have a very huge menu!

The shop is quite small with one table mainly for order and pick up. I was getting my car fixed at midas near by when I had the urge to grab some food and I found this location near by. 

I looked at the vast menu and it took some time to go over and finally I pinned down their Cantonese Noodles dish called \"Cantonese Shrimp Lo Mein\"... The dish was freshly made as it was fuming hot and quantity was great as well. There were good amounts of veges and shrimps and they were quite tasty. 

The service was good, the cashier was friendly and the food came out in a decent time!"}
{"text":"We called to order and we were told that the minimum delivery in St-Hubert is $30.00. We receive the take-out menu regularly and it says minimum $15.00. False advertising. We will never order from them again and we'll make sure to let everyone know about it."}
{"text":"Petite erreur dans ma livraison mais les dumplings au lieu des rouleaux étaient très bons. Je vais commander à nouveau, excellent portion et même si les crevettes étaient un peu trop cuites le poulet et le boeuf étaient parfait."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time ordering delivery from this place. After the food was already 25 minutes late I decided to find out if I'd ever get it and to my surprise my order hadn't even left the restaurant yet. If you order from this restaurant make sure you do so a good 2 hours in advance and you might get your food when you expect it."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to order delivery from. It was our first time trying it today and I honestly didn't have much expectations but am glad it turned out good. 

We ordered the lemon chicken (it was okay, crispy tho) , mapo tofu (love it), chicken fried rice (not too crazy about it but it wasn't overly salty thank goodness), beef with black pepper sauce (surprisingly good) and beef ho fun (a bit bland but it was okay).

Their menu is extensive so theres a lot to choose from. Price is reasonable too. Portion wise was moderate since I got more portions in other places compared to them. Just saying. 

If ever you want to order within Mississauga try them out."}
{"text":"Could it be? Great Asian delivery in montreal?! The tom-yum with coconut was spicy and legit. Massive portion, piping hot and delicious. Ravioli peanut dumps were also very good. Everyone was super smiley and nice. Quick delivery. Will def order again."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Fast delivery. My first choice for Chinese food every time. Only downside is, they close at 10pm. ):"}
{"text":"No warning that there was egg in the
shanghai noodle, which I can't eat. Also, shanghai noodles are supposed to be thick noodles in a nice sweet and sour sauce, this was skinny egg noodles covered in turmeric, more like indian food :/"}
{"text":"This place is good when you need something quick, cheap and filling. Food is greasy, starchy and the meat could be more plentiful. I do shamefully admit to returning time and time again for the evenings I need a quick meal."}
