{"text":"One of my favorite places in Madison. Friendly staff and great food! I like the red curry, stuffed chicken wings, and pork pot stickers. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"I know this place has gotten some good reviews but....some serious attitude We got in and it was a little busy but got seated and ordered. My order came and we waited over 25 minutes for my wife's meal to come. When I mentioned it to the waitress she got pissed and went on how busy they were. To which I understood but would've liked her to understand that she could've waited on mine to bring out until just before or the same time brings my wife's. When my wife's meal did come out the rice was way over cooked, wet and mushy, Gross. They refused to replace the rice and were rude about it. It's just rice, I know my rice and when it's wet and overcooked. Never even had overcooked rice at a mall fast food Chinese so what's up with that? Really poor for a place such as this and the money you spend for that. Then I was rudely told they didn't accept credit cards or debit cards, \"sign in the window as you come in.\"  OK, out a here. Oh, what sign in the window, didn't see it as we left, looking for it."}
{"text":"We live just down the road, so this is one of our frequent take-out spots.  We have probably eaten here on the order of 300 times over the years.  We always share an entree, and maybe a couple of their veggie eggrolls or curry puffs.  That always leaves us both stuffed, so you know the portions are huge here.  My wife and I both absolutely LOVE the Panang Curry with chicken.  The sauce is super-creamy and peanutty, with just enough bite to open up the sinuses but not make it all you can taste.  The chicken is white meat, well-trimmed, and big chunks of carrot and potato.  We have to force ourselves to order different items, because this dish is so addictive.  We also have liked the Beef Musamun, although we don't get that as much because it is so filling it's hard to finish.  Just last night we had the spicy Peanut Chicken, and it was great.  We will definitely order it again soon.  They don't skimp on the meat, and it is always cooked nice and tender, with no gristle like a lot of asian restaurants pass off.    We are total fans and can't recommend Sala Thai highly enough!"}
{"text":"Was my second time coming to this place only because I like the food in the first time, but to my surprise quality had gone down substantially . The plates we were served were not clean and we had to wipe them of with napkins before eating of them, we ordered pad cashew and it really isn't what they used to serve . Will not be coming here again just because of the hyge"}
{"text":"YUM!  Love the shrimp spring rolls, the curry puffs, the Pad Thai, the Curry Squash, N3 (can't remember the name).  Haven't had a bad dish yet!"}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite Tai food! Pros: Great customer service- always kind and patient with me asking so many questions. As a vegetarian I do tend to ask a lot of questions.   The food is wonderful. Its simple. They do a great job with everything on the menu.....so good in fact that my bf eats here at least once a week lol.  Good prices and pick up options"}
{"text":"mouth-watering and delicious.  the yum tofu salad is my current favorite. the pad thai is delicious. the spring roll with plum sauce is to die for! the line out the door can't be wrong. everything is similarly priced to other thai restaurants but it seems like you get just a little more than usual."}
{"text":"Went to Sala Thai two nights ago, was very busy but received our appetizers in a short amount of time and entrees commensurate.  Small restaurants like this keep their costs down by mostly family running the place, so when we have been there, there has been momma cooking in the kitchen and daughter tending the front of the house.  Two people can only do so much so fast.  We have had Pad Thai in many places around Madison but we think this is the best, with the right noodles and sauce the limes, not lemons.    The Vietnamese Egg Rolls were crispy and seemed fresh made and the peanut sauce was the perfect compliment.    This time, I had the Curry Combo, which had potatoes, pineapple, green beans, pork, shrimp and chicken.  This had a red curry sauce that had just the right amount of heat for me.  Lots of pork and a good number of whole shrimp (watch for the ail shells which were still on) but I didn't find anything that seemed like chicken (though it may have had a similar texture to the pork).  A very pleasant meal once again and a great place to go back.  The waitress remembers us every time."}
{"text":"If you want the BEST yellow chicken curry in Madison,this is the place!! Everything on the menu is delish,recently tried the seafood curry,AMAZING! The decor is so cool and the owners are great!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times. I am surprised it doesn't have a higher rating, but I suspect it might be because it isn't particularly fancy. Yet, if you want some classic Thai food, this is my favorite place in town.  Sala is a cozy house they have turned into a restaurant. The family who owns it is super nice and they use all their own vegetables from their own garden. If they run out, or don't have enough, they supplement by buying from the Farmer's Market in town. This care to quality shows in the food. My husband and I have never had a bad experience. If we order take out they are always very fast. The food is always fresh tasting, spiced appropriately the way you prefer.   In a lot of ways, I think Sala is a hidden gem. It's affordable, friendly, fast and delicious with fresh flavor and good standards."}
{"text":"Food was good along with their prices. Customer service was ok. The woman who took our order and served us was nice but the kid that seated us and brought our water seemed like he didn't want to be there. I would return again just for their pad Thai."}
{"text":"We were visiting Madison and thought we checked out this place because of its good reviews.  However, the food was really salty - especially pad thai.  I found the waitress (older lady) a little bit rude, in the middle of ordering she cut us off since there were people coming in... she said \"it's taking too long, I have to attend to them...\" but we were just getting started with our orders. I also noticed that she was extremely nice and polite to the other customers and not to us, partially because I think we were \"non-white.\" (at least this was my impression).  When we addressed our concerns about the salty dishes, she got defensive and did not do anything about it.  She apologized towards the end about,  but she still charged us for it;  she also tried to over charge us but luckily we caught it, so please check your tickets before paying.  She ruined my dinner experience and was very disappointed with the food.   I have had better Thai food before and will not recommend this place.   We will never go back there again!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered carryout from Sala Thai for the first time tonight. We were impressed with the quality and flavor of the food, and also thought the price was fair for the portion size. We'll definitely be returning again, though perhaps next time to enjoy their cute little dining room, which has great atmosphere.   Very happy to have found this spot in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Thai food was mediocre at best. Not sure why the reviews are so high but I was disappointed. We ordered the pad Thai, green curry, egg rolls, and crab wontons. The pad Thai was seriously dry and tasteless. The curry was ok but they gave us a tiny amount of rice, enough for 2 people (there were 4 of us). The egg rolls were burnt and the dough on the wontons was extremely chewy. Maybe we didn't order the right dishes, but I feel like pad Thai is pretty standard. If you can't get that right, I'm not sure I'm willing to give it a second chance.  The icing on the cake though was that we called the order in for pick up and when we got there and pulled our card out, they apologized and said they only accept cash or check. Probably would've been beneficial to know beforehand. Much better Thai food in the area.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Went here on vacation and loved it.  The decor was festive, the tables are spaced far enough apart that you feel like you have space, the wait staff was friendly and attentive, the food was great, and so was the price.  The panang curry was exceptional."}
{"text":"So, after my first experience here I have to say it was a positive one! I parked right in front of the door, went in and ordered. It is quiet, a not too bright or dark, and service was prompt. My food was delicious! I ordered it extra spicy and as you can see there were no leftovers. I was starving when I got there and full and happy when I left! I highly recommend you try this place with your friends, there is something here for everyone and I can't wait to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant to date. The food is authentic, delicious and the services is so warm and familial.  What stood out to me about this restaurant is their amazing service and attitude towards my brother who has autism. He's kind of loud and a very picky eater and I think the waiters and workers saw how hard my parents were trying to make sure he behaved. They always treated him so well and without fail always gave him a plate a free crab rangoons and other small sample plates to see if there would be anything he liked.   Great place and great people."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai restaurant in Madison. Up until I ate at Sala Thai I hadn't found any Thai restaurants in Madison that I liked. The decor is great. Having visited Thailand before it reminded me of my vacation there and made me really want to go back there. The Tom Yum soup was great as was my yellow curry. My SO got the peanut chicken and that was delicious too. I will return there for sure."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now and I'm a fan. Nothing fancy, just good food, reasonable prices, and fresh ingredients. The veggies in the stir fry dishes are cooked just enough - they retain all of their crispness and flavor. It's a shame that most of the Thai places in town overcook their dishes.  The presentation isn't fancy - it feels a little like a home cooked meal, if your mom cooked really tasty Thai food. A great choice if you're looking for an inexpensive meal in a casual restaurant."}
{"text":"The Tom yum soup was fantastic.  Great Vietnamese spring rolls and peanut sauce.  The crab Rangoons were much better than at most Chinese restaurants.  The pad kaprow with mushrooms was very good but a little too spicy, it was hard to taste the Basil."}
{"text":"GO HERE FOR THAI FOOD IN MADISON!  I've traveled around the world and had Thai food throughout Asia and the UK (yes the UK has great Thai food) and Sala Thai (in my opinion) is the most authentic Thai food restaurant Madison has to offer.  Yes...it's a dive.  It's small and seating is limited, but if can ignore the size of this restaurant, then you will be extremely pleased with the food they have to offer."}
{"text":"I had originally intended to order carry out but when I arrived, I felt suddenly parched for a glass of wine ;o) I asked the woman at the cash register if it was okay if I just sat on their bench near the register with my glass of wine and maybe nibbled on my food a little. She offered one better and graciously invited me to sit at one of their dining room tables. This was 8:30 pm and dining room service had already been winding down.  She set the table with a place mat and a cold glass of ice water, even taking out the already packaged to go container in a ceramic bowl and gave me a plate with utensils. I offered for her to take the clean plate away since I didn't want to dirty an unnecessary dish. She insisted I use the dish as \"the food will taste better that way\".  She was so right!  I ordered the green curry with to tofu, and the green papaya salad with a side of grilled chicken and sticky rice.   I have been missing a solid green curry every since my favorite little hole in the wall near Woodman's West closed down and the one at Sala Thai is a great replacement. The curry was thick in consistency and aromatic in flavor. It came with Thai eggplants, bamboo shoots, carrots, green beans and basil. The portion was huge, and even as I ate to my hearts content, there was plenty of leftovers.  Check out the photo of the papaya salad, it was a huge, delicious, saucy mix of green papaya, carrots, roasted peanuts in a tangy, sweet, chili sauce with a hint of fish sauce. The crisp shredded green papaya mingled with the simple and light sauce to bring together a taste worth seeking out for. The all white meat grilled chicken was lightly seasoned and grilled with a char flavor. Take a bite of the sticky rice, chicken and papaya salad all on one fork - it's the best way to enjoy this entree!  One of the many great things about Sala Thai is their dishes! This may be a head-scratcher, but I really loved their dishes! They had these glossy, porcelain dishes and serve ware with beautiful designs, replacing the plain white plates you encounter in typical restaurants now days. It really makes the presentation value just as high as the preparation.  I implore you to step out of your Willy St bubble and surround yourself with thoughtfully prepared, delicious Thai food at Sala Thai!"}
{"text":"I like that this place is in my neighborhood. It was fun watching them convert the space from an old empty nothingness to somewhere nice to meet up with friends for lunch or dinner. I have to admit though that I am an utter wimp when it comes to spicy food. I grew up with mac and cheese and have very little tolerance for spicy heat in foods. It sucks at times. Anyways, I usually get the crab rangoon to start and it is very tasty, light and crisp. For an entree I usually get the chicken curry because I love it so. I'm no afienado about Thai food and can not comment on its authenacity , I just know that I like it a lot.   There hours can be somewhat spotty. I don't remember when it was exactly, but I recall stopping by to get lunch and they were closed and it seemed a very odd time and day to be closed."}
{"text":"At first glance, this is a tiny little shop off of fair oaks Ave, and I didn't expect much going in. Thai food is my all time faves, and having learned how to make many dishes from my son's grandmother from Thailand, I set the bar high when I go out to eat these dishes.  Walking in, it is a very traditional setting placing high value on the history of thier heritage, which made it feel warm and welcoming. The decor is beautiful, having a few pa toong hanging from the wall and plants making it feel even more homey.   The restaurant and bathroom was very clean and fully stocked which translates to me that they care about their clientele.  I went for thier dinner and lunch menus, with dinner having the more extensive options available. I had the Gaeng Ped Gai, and it tasted every bit like my son's grandmother cooks for us when she visits. It was creamy, flavorful, and just enough spice to complement the flavors in the curry. My son had Pad Thai, and it has improved so much from previous visits. The first few batches we tried we're bland and lacking flavor, and they stepped their game up!! This time had bean sprouts, crushed peanuts and fresh cilantro. I was pleasantly surprised!!!  For lunch on another visit, I had thier red curry dish, which came with a soup or salad of the day and I tried thier salad. The dressing on the salad had good flavor to it, being a little sweet but smoky. The curry came with a side of rice and had a wonderful flavor, making it hard to share with the other diners at the table because I wanted leftovers!!! I also had a glass of thier plum wine, and it is sweeter than most plum wine varieties I've tried. Good flavor, but not something you would want more than one glass from.  I would recommend this place if you like to feel like you're walking in to a little piece of cultural history from somewhere else."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Thai restaurant in Madison. Cozy, great atmosphere, wonderful owners, and exceptional food."}
{"text":"-1 star for not taking cards. Other than that, they are an excellent place to spend the cash your Grandma gives you. Highly recommend the Thai Iced Coffee, Thai Iced Tea and all their curries."}
{"text":"Initial impression after a quick lunch - really nothing special.   The lunch menu entrees ranged from $8-$11, with stir fry and curry options. The included side salad was very sad, and if the entree came out of a can I wouldn't have been impressed. The highlight of the meal was chicken egg rolls with some sort of plum sauce.   Service was fine, I was surprised that two tables missed the cash or check only signs which are posted throughout the establishment; however the waiter handled the issue professionally.   Bathrooms were clean, ambience was dated Thai, but cozy."}
{"text":"So today is my third or fourth time here and I am trying the Thai spring rolls and Pad Wu Sen!  Ordered extra hot and she says oh they make it mean hot maybe too hot!  Well only one way to find out!!  Mean hot here I come!  Will update later!"}
{"text":"So, the service is a little slow -- who cares? That's the only weakness here. The food is lovely, the people are charming, the prices are insanely reasonable. This is now my new Thai-go-to in town. Yum!"}
{"text":"I really didn't want to rate this place so low because of its locality and my support for small businesses, but it was quite disappointing on our last visit. I've been here a few previous times, and this will probably be my last visit to this place.   1) The food quality has definitely gone down. We ordered a variety of appetizers and a total of 6 entrees; 2 noodle dishes and 4 meat dishes. The pad thai was okay, very bland but edible; the Pad Wun Sen noodles however was definitely too salty and way over cooked. All I could taste was the salt/fish sauce content. Two of my meat dishes tasted exactly the same despite it being completely different ingredients and all 4 were super salty with very little meat. Considering each entree was about $13-$14, I expected a little more than a few pieces of thinly sliced chicken. Definitely not worth the money.     2) Service started out great as we were the only customers; however, as more people came in, we were completely neglected and none of our cups were filled. We waited for a long time before they even noticed that we were done and ready to leave.   3) CASH ONLY (new policy). I supposed the small fee associated with credit cards is worth the inconvenience of their customers! We were never told it was cash only aside from a little print out on their counter and so as an avid debit card user whom hardly ever carry cash around these days, I had to send one of my parties out to a gas station to get cash for the bill which was over $100."}
{"text":"Had another excellent meal tonight. I had the cucumber salad with spicy dressing. Sweet and tangy and a bit hot. I also had N3 which was a bean thread noodle dish which came with chicken and shrimp. It was excellent. Spicy but not too hot. Plenty of carrots and a yummy brown sauce. Very reasonably priced. Be sure to try this neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"If you ask me, Sala Thai is underrated. There are several popular Thai restaurants in this neighborhood, and if one of the others is packed, I suggest you head here. The food is just about as good as anywhere else, the atmosphere is great, service is good and there likely won't be a wait. Great for take-out too.   Don't forget to bring cash, they don't take credit cards!"}
{"text":"I don't remember name of my curry soup, maybe Ka it was very good and I would try other things in future.  We sat out front of restaurant, so I never went inside."}
{"text":"Seeing that this is the closest Thai food restaurant to my house we decided to finally give it a go. The service is really nice and there is a great atmosphere but the food doesn't quite stack up to the other amazing Thai restaurants in Madison. We ordered the standard chicken dinner pad Thai but there wasn't much meat in it. We were underwhelmed. The other downside is the cash or check only payment options. Fortunately I carry an emergency 20 in my wallet or I would have been in trouble.   Overall review- MEH"}
{"text":"Great place in my neighborhood. Love their squash curry with chicken and the vegetable curry too. We had a block party the other weekend and the owner brought us pans of the squash curry, pad Thai and egg rolls. They were the hit of the party."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with some girlfriends. We ordered beef laab, squash curry, pad thai w/tofu and something else I can't seem to recall. The beef laab was my favorite dish, seasoned just right with lime. I asked that the pad thai be a little spicy (like as in a replication of another restaurant's version of its pad thai) but  that didn't turn out so well. It looked like they just rolled the tofu in red curry paste. It was way too spicy and just killed the flavors of the dish. So, don't ask for variations.  Oh! The 4th dish was the tom yum seafood house special or some sort-very good.  The service was good and attentive to refilling water.  This isn't my favorite place for Lao/Thai food, but I wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"wow this place is good! I don't understand why they put orange slices in your water but it doesn't matter because their stuffed chicken wings made my day!!!!"}
{"text":"Sala Thai is great. I've eaten here many times since moving to Madison, and I've always been happy with the food.  On Saturday, I ordered the Yellow Chicken Curry. It was fantastic. It was a generous portion, and they didn't skimp on the chicken. It also had just the right amount of spice. Really fantastic dish, and I can't wait to order it again.  In the past I've had ordered the Pad Thai and a few of their stir fry dishes, and they have always been top-notch. Their eggrolls are also very good. They also have a decent selection of bottled beer and wine.  The restaurant space is nice and cozy, and can get crowded on a Saturday night. Service is always friendly, and while the food doesn't always come out super-quick, it's worth the wait.  They are unfortunately cash-only, so plan accordingly. It is somewhat unforgivable in 2014 to both not accept credit cards AND not have an ATM available in your restaurant. This alone prevents me from giving Sala Thai a full 5-star rating. Otherwise this is really a perfect little Thai restaurant with fantastic food."}
{"text":"I was so happy to have a Thai restaurant open within walking distance of my house.  My husband and I, alias Meat and Potatoes Man and Veggie Girl, visited shortly they opened and loved the food and homey feel. Their vegetarian curry was as good as any I've ever had, and we enjoyed chatting with our server, who appeared to be the owner.   We were sure this would be a favorite to visit often.    Unfortunately, the next time we stopped by we found the hours reduced and the place closed.  The next time we came, it was simply closed -- on a zero-degree Saturday evening.  We were not amused.  I haven't been able to talk him into going back since then."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time last week and I have to say it's my new favorite Thai spot!! I loved the spicy cucumber salad and the pad Thai with tofu. The pad Thai was super saucy and delicious. We also ordered the panang curry with chicken which was creamy, spicy and super flavorful. Overall the service and experience was also wonderful :) will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"My family has been back about a dozen times now and we keep falling in love with this place and the food. Great food. Service can be a little slow on busy nights but the food is worth the wait. Wish that they took Debit/Credit cards but I can live with getting cash before going in to eat. Curry Fried Rice and Penang Peek Gain are favorites but there is so much more."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Sala Thai at least a half dozen times. Each time I very happy with the food. I recommend it to friends and family.  A bad sign:  They have stopped accepting credit cards. We were told to go to the ATM at the corner gas station. This is a shame as this will most surely hurt their sales. Also, it makes me wonder if they are going out of business.   I will continue to eat there as long as they are around."}
{"text":"Of all the Thai Restaurants in Madison, I think the food here is the best, but parking is a problem and there is a language barrier issue.  The bathroom is very clean and amazingly decorated as is the whole restaurant!  Just gorgeous.  I had ordered something and the waitress did not ask me my choice of meat and brought shrimp. I am deathly allergic to shrimp - tried to explain this and she just didn't understand.  To avoid any problems, I reordered and we brought the shrimp dish home, husband ate it.   It's a little out of the way and the service is a bit slow but I still feel it is the best Thai food in town.  The prices are bit  high but as they say, you get what you pay for for."}
{"text":"I had a nice meal.  Red curry duck.  I would have liked more duck, but the taste was great.  Quick in and out."}
{"text":"Food is great and authentic as it comes so I'm not sure what all the complaints are about? Cash only is pretty clear and listed at the register in case you miss it coming in.   It's kind of frustrating seeing people say that the pad Thai isn't authentic or the food in general isn't. Their pad Thai is different than the Americanized version you typically get these days- it's more sweet as it's listed in the description on the menu... so learn to read before coming here?   Everything I've tried here has been delicious and fresh. They do a great job of changing up the \"typical\" American/mainstream food you eat and I don't have anything but positive things to say."}
{"text":"As far as Thai food goes in Madison, this is the best. I have lived here for a couple years and until yesterday haven't found good Thai food. Having been to Thai land several times and coming from San Francisco (great Thai restaurants every where!) I can say without a doubt that they know what they are doing. I got take out so I can't speak to service, but my food was hot and ready right when they said it would be and it was delicious."}
{"text":"On a frigid cold Friday night we bundled up and dragged our pouting toddler who would rather stay at home and play to this wonderful restaurant. First impressions: the lighting was low and romantic there were all sorts of art and sculptures on the wall and plenty to look at. Normally my kid would love this but she was in a sour mood and said \"I don't like it!\" (With a lot of attitude). There was street parking and the restroom was clean.   We ordered mango juice, curry puffs and sticky rice to get started. Kiddo's mood was quickly escalating to a full blown tantrum that was suddenly diffused by the cute container the sticky rice was served in. I would've taken a picture but I was too busy shoveling the rice down her throat and seeing a total 180deg transformation with each bite. The curry puffs..... sigh! One order comes with 4 pieces (generous portions), the filling was reminiscent of a samosa. We loved it! It came with a dipping sauce. I loved that the sauces were not watered down and had so much great flavor.  For our main course we got the Raad Na noodles and vegetarian Tofu Pad Prik (red curry based) we ordered the vegetables spicy. The noodles were so flavorful and the sauce had a little sweet finish to it. The red curry was pretty spicy no need to add any hot sauce to it. I'm glad we tried something other than our standard curry and fried rice. We can't wait to come back and try other things off the menu.  Price: very reasonable whole dinner was under $30 One thing to note: they take CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Thai.. squash curry with chicken excellent , listed as mild but expect spicey. Love mango sticky rice and good price."}
{"text":"1.  Strange Hours: 5pm-9pm on several days of the week.  Huh?    2.  Spotty service:  I placed an order to-go and waited near the counter.  So why did the other waitress (there were only 2 of them) have to ask me about my order?  I told her and she promptly headed to the floor to serve some other seated customers, doing nothing with the info I shared with her.  She did the same for another guy who was just picking up an order placed over the phone, asking for his name and doing nothing, all after seeing the other waitress attend to him.  Odd.  3.  The wait:  Pad Thai should not take 25 minutes to prepare.  Also, if I order it WITHOUT peanuts - a common allergen - please don't tell me you put peanuts on it by mistake and ask it was okay.  I specified no peanuts firstly (ok, ok, I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste) so what was the point of asking?  That added another 10 minutes for the new dish.  4.  The food:  I had the sticky rice and sweet mango which was a very pleasant surprise.  The pad thai lacked \"umami\".  It just wasn't tasty.  The noodles were overcooked in a sauce that had obviously dried down too much.  The sauce had an odd, sour and tacky tamarind taste that did not coat the mouth the way delicious food does.  There was no oral satisfaction.  After every bite was chewed and slid down my throat, it was as though the next bite was my first.  My mouth did not seem to recognize that I just ate something.  Really weird.    5.  Ambiance:  I liked how this place looked and would gladly dine here again if I could be guaranteed a yummy dish."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Food was delicious and hot. We had crab rangoon, Pad Thai  and Pad Se Ew. Plan on going back."}
{"text":"Nice place. Inexpensive wine list was nice. They gave our child a sippy cup, which was sweet.    I love that my yellow curry was spicy, but not too spicy. Excellent complex flavor.   The crab rangoons were the best my husband ever had, he said.   They don't take credit cards, but that didn't bother us.   The only negative was that the walls could use a scrub down. But overall a great experience"}
{"text":"Meh- for a place that is supposedly owned by the people who make the curry for the Corner Store on Willy Street (best curry i've had in the US), I was horribly disappointed.  We showed up at 8:30pm, which is a little late since they close at 9 but still seemed okay, I think, and even though there was only one other group in the restaurant, they told us it would be a 15 minute wait.  We stood our ground, pointing out the 15+ empty tables in the restaurant, and they finally grudgingly sat us.    From there, everything moved very slowly......we had some spring rolls that were about 95% lettuce (supposed to have shrimp in them?) and my massaman curry was pretty bland- just a bunch of beef in some sauce, without the usual potatoes, nuts, and a few vegetables.   All in all, the atmosphere is nice with a lot of decorations straight from Thailand, but for good food and service, go anywhere else."}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed my dinner here.  There is a nice selection of vegetarian appetizers and my meal was nicely spiced.  They offer your typical Thai dishes, priced at roughly $7 an entree.  The decor is nice and the service was pretty good.  It's not a huge place, so I assume it can fill up during peak times."}
{"text":"Have tried several different things here. All are extremely good and have not been disappointed. Several items bring the heat as they should so be prepared. Oh so good."}
{"text":"My wife loves curry dishes and we've tried almost every spot in town and have decided this is amoungst our favorites.  Cash only. Very good."}
{"text":"Let me start my review off by referring to someone else's post from 2010: \"Quite a few people have posted their glowing reviews of this particular restaurant, and I can't help but wonder if I'm on a bad acid trip or these people have never been outside of their special box.\" I absolutely love this restaurant, and I am part Thai and have been to Thailand several times to visit my family, so perhaps you are the one inside a 'special box' because this restaurant is as authentic as Thai-Isaan gets.  Ever since my mother passed in 2012, I have been looking for a Thai place that could cook genuine Thai-Isaan food. Sala Thai has been the only place I have found in Madison that makes their dishes almost like my Mom's. The food is superb and I would recommend it for anyone wanting to try Thai (and Isaan) for the first time.  My only two complaints (which is why I have given it 4 out of 5 stars) is that they do not take debit or credit and that the wait for drink and food orders can take a long time. However, they stay pretty busy so the latter is understandable."}
{"text":"This is hands-down the most authentic and flavorful Thai food in Wisconsin. My partner and I eat South East Asian religiously. When we travel we look for Southeast Asian restaurants mainly Thai,  Lao, Vietnamese. There are several very good curry use in Madison we just happen to be blessed with good curries. But the curries here at Sala Thai are unmatched. Richly flavored, fragrant,..... so tasty!! The Pad Krapao is a spicey masterpiece!  The spicey noodles, LAAB, Pad Wun Sen.....good. If you like spice and heat, come here. But every dish can be made to your specific heat tolerance including zero heat. And the soups? Won Ton, PHO, Tom Yum.....again, simply the best in town!! This is a family business and they are typically a bit short waitstaff. So if you want to great food come here. But please understand in advance you may have to wait a bit for it. Don't come here if you are on a short schedule.  I also must say that they have the friendliest waitstaff in owners in the business!! I LOVE this place!!!"}
{"text":"Sala Thai might be my new spot.  I'm a sucker for good, spicy thai, and i have been searching around Madison for my favorite spot.  I have had Bahn Thai, Ha-Long Bay, Lao Laan-Xang, Sa-Bai Thong, and Vientiane and i have to say this may be the best bang for your buck as well as the most flavorful.  The curry puffs are as good as i have ever had and you get 4 humungous puffs for 2.95. If you like spicy, go with the green curry, probably one of the best curries i have ever had.  Overall this place is worth the short (5-10 minute) drive from campus for how inexpensive it is. Most dishes run between 7-8 dollars, with a few above 9. All the appetizers are between 2-4 and you get a significant portion. You could easily come here with 4 people and spend 8 dollars each for a large amount of food.  I look forward to returning"}
{"text":"While the lunch I had at Sala Thai wasn't BAD, it certainly wasn't good.  I have to say that my ginger chicken over rice didn't taste very ginger-y at all, and had sort of a fast-food chinese food type gravy.  I was totally underwhelmed.  The decor was nice though."}
{"text":"What other place can you find a place in Madison that makes you feel your in Thailand. The atmosphere, staff and food will take you there! We have been fans of Sala Thai for years and know where we can go for the freshest dish with a home cooking feel!   We Sala Thai! Spicy Pepper made with love!"}
{"text":"I had a green curry and tofu pad prik, both were quite good. The Green curry was spicy without being overpowering, or more specifically it was that good cooked in spice rather than just adding more paste. This is a good place."}
{"text":"I love Chinese & Vietnamese food; this was my first visit to a Thai place and it wasn't a good experience. Weird flavor, squishy (overcooked?) noodles, just yuck. It may just be that Thai food's not my thing, but I didn't like the food here much at all and I'm usually all about Asian food."}
{"text":"This was my second visit attempting to use a $25.00 Restaurant.com certificate.  The first visit I realized that with plate prices between 9.50 and 12.50 that between two of us, we couldn't possibly meet the minimum purchase of $50.00.  My second attempt to use the $25.00 off was tonight with 3 friends.  We started off with an appetizer of Chicken Satay with peanut sauce and a cucumber salad.  YUM.  For entrees, Pad Thai, Pad Se Ew, Pad Wu Sen, and Squash Curry.  Very good, all of it.  The noodles on the Pad Se Ew were overdone, but OK.  The problem came with the billing.  The $25 off Restaurant.com certificate clearly stated that it was not valid on Saturdays.  Well, it was Friday night.  Our server said that the certificate was no good on weekends.  I clearly stated, showed her the highlighted exclusion for Saturdays, that it was Friday night, and that the exclusion is not for weekend nights...just Saturday.  She understood, and asked her co-worker to explain to us that the coupon isn't good on weekends.  I again said, it is Friday.  It's no good on Saturday.  She left, talked to a cook who hollered at her and nobody came back to talk to us and re-explain why the certificate was no good.  We left the full balance of the bill, plus generous tip, but will not go back.  It was very frustrating."}
{"text":"Today I ordered a curry dish for lunch. They gave it to me in a paper container, so when I got home it had leaked everywhere. And I didn't receive a salad like the menu said I would.   Just disappointed."}
{"text":"We recently went to this restaurant because of the good reviews we read here at Yelp.  Sadly, we can barely review this restaurant because the door was locked even though their hours said they were open and there was an \"open\" sign in the window.  I tried the door and then noticed that there were people inside hiding behind some tables!  What the heck!  Not a good way to run a business."}
{"text":"I came here en route to Chicago. Impressed by the menu & enticed by the Lao menu. Of course, for whatever reason , Lao dishes are always way more than their Thai counterparts despite widely same spices. I digress, food... Thai tea-awesome one of the best I've had, no skimping on the size, 1/2&1/2, sugar or flavor. Excellent!! Gai mok- very excited as I've only had the fish \"version\" which is amazing. It wasn't steamed long enough and the middle was cold. It was ok, but overall wouldn't get it again. The cold part just turned me off.  Laab gai Lao style- was kinda sad they couldn't prepare it as a cold salad (which is how my nephew's Laotian family serves it and how I had it in Thailand) but they tried their best to accommodate although when I asked them to put it in the fridge after prep as it would be take out, I don't think they understood as the waitress said they don't have a fridge.  Gai yang (bbq chicken) with papaya salad and sticky rice- outstanding, the chicken was boneless breast, well marinated, delicious, the sticky rice perfect along with a side of papaya salad, pefect, just like you would get in Thailand. Outstanding. Even the table next to me asked what I ordered and commented it looked very good. It was so good, I wanted to share it with him...then I thought that would be weird, so I didn't offer."}
{"text":"Quite a few people have posted their glowing reviews of this particular restaurant, and I can't help but wonder if I'm on a bad acid trip or these people have never been outside of their special box.    I've got permanent, major wang for Pad See Ew, and Sala Thai's version definitely puts the ewwwwwww in it.  That was some seriously sour, overcooked, squishy noodles.    I also ordered two veggie spring rolls and was surprised to find that they resembled a wet paper towel wrapped around a bunch of lettuce.  So why would anyone purposely put wet paper towels and lettuce in their mouth?? Well, I like to live dangerously, and I'll try anything once.    It turns out the sauce is pretty good, but no amount of good tasting sauce can save lettuce wrapped in wet paper towels.  We also tried two other dishes, a curry type deal that I can't really remember, and some thai fried rice.  The thai fried rice was an abomination.    In fact, Bandung has much better thai fried rice, and other thai dishes and at the same cost as Sala Thai.    Finally, yes, these people are friggin' slowwwwww, and you know, it would be ok if the food was worth it, but sour, overcooked food and wet paper towel spring rolls is not."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Really enjoyed our meal and the service was friendly and warm"}
{"text":"An hour wait is not acceptable.  Not sure if the food is any good or how much longer it would have taken, as we walked out after waiting forever for our meal."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, the best Thai/Lao food in Madison for the price, and probably tied with Lao Lang Xaang for best in class, period.  I'm not sure where others are getting their spring rolls, but Sala Thai's are consistently delicious and packed full of goodness, whether the veg or shrimp are ordered.  The Thai curry puffs, fried shrimp and fried egg rolls are some of the best I have ever had, anywhere.  The tom kha soup is delicate, flavorful and spicy, and chock-full of button mushrooms dotting the surface.  Curry dishes do not disappoint, and range from light and delicate to hot and spicy.  There is almost invariably enough for another meal to take home.  Staff are often no-nonsense, but if you go there enough, they are quick to welcome you back time and again.  The owner's father recently passed away and the restaurant was closed for a time as she traveled across the globe to attend to her family's affairs.  We're so glad that you're back, Sala Thai!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been talking about going to Sala Thai for quite a while now and tonight we finally did. The decor is quirky, adorable and not too noisy. The service was an oonsy bit slow (hence the 4 stars rather than 5), but charming & lovely all at the same time so it balanced out.  The food was seriously kick-ass, all around flavorful & perfectly done. We started by sharing the pork pot stickers and a spring roll. The pot stickers were crunchy, but not at all greasy, filled with delicious pork and just the right amount of spices. The spring roll was fresh, clean and crisp with a myriad of textures/flavors. We enjoyed both very much.  For entrees, I had the Panang Peek Gai and my husband had Panang with beef. Both were right on point and we fully plan on ordering them again - hopefully very, very soon. The Panang Peek Gai consists of a spicy peanut sauce served over chicken wings stuffed with pork & glass noodle which have been fried to perfection. I LOVED it! So fantastic! My husband's Panang with beef was decadent, just the right amount of heat blended with sweet notes and richness. The beef was tender and every flavor melded together perfectly with after hints of Thai basil. Our server was charming and she was always available for whatever we needed. Great job, Sala Thai! We will be back very soon!!!"}
{"text":"I went here a little bit ago with my boyfriend. I got pad thai, and I don't recall what he got. He loved everything but I was less than impressed. I thought the pad thai was average, and there are definitely other places I'd rather go for my Thai fix. I would be willing to give other things on the menu a try, though. It's a ton of food and really reasonably priced. We got 2 entres and an order of pot stickers and we're out the door for ~$25.  The restaurant itself is really cute, and the older lady that waits all the tables is gracious, nice, and pretty funny.   They also only take cash! And no atm, so come prepared."}
{"text":"Love Thai food and this is my favorite Thai spot in Madison.  They have a number of Lao dishes that are excellent.  We usually go for the curry squash and the crispy rice.  Cool décor as well.  Great little out of the way place, clean too."}
{"text":"I went with a friend who recommended this place. First tip: cash only!  The lunch menu is pretty concise: appetizers, noodles, and curry.   We started off with vegetarian pot stickers. There were 6 in the order compared to 4 pork ones. They were bite sized pot stickers and filling with the main entree.  I ended up getting the chicken pad thai. It was saucier than I expected which I really like because most pad thai's seem dry. It was just the right amount of food for lunch. It's a great place for smaller groups and for 2-3 people.   Next time I am trying a curry dish for sure."}
{"text":"Best Thai ever!!! This is a lovely, pretty, family-run place in a pretty random place. The food is amazing, and pretty close to authentic. Bring cash, because they are cash only, and allow for time depending on how busy they are, but you won't regret looking this place up. I've tried a bunch of things there, but I keep coming back to the Green Curry with Tofu. They do tofu really well here - I'm not vegetarian but this is one of my criteria for good Thai food."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I have been searching for a place like this in Madison for literally years. We ate here for the first time last night and we were both blown away. Hands down the best Thai food in Madison. We have tried every other place and always been disappointed with the lack of authenticity. Sala Thai is to die for. He had C2 on the menu (tamarind beef? I think) and it was to die for. The beef melts in your mouth. I had a vegetarian option which was also very good. We are already planning to go back next weekend for date night."}
{"text":"Great food, similar to all the other good Thai restaurants in town. My favorite is pra ram long song - fresh steamed veggies with peanut sauce. Squash curry, yellow curry, and musamun are also fantastic.  The dining room is very small, and it fills up in the evening. Service is hit or miss - mostly hit, but sometimes very slow, and it can be hard to get a recommendation or make substitutions when there's a language barrier. We've never been served the wrong food.  Quick Tip: Squash curry is always spicy, no matter how zero-stars they claim it is."}
{"text":"PROS: Seems authentic, reasonable prices CONS: Didn't like my dish, cash-only, super slow service  I'm a big fan of Thai curries and noodles. One of my favorite noodle dishes is the Pad See Ew (a stir-fried rice noodle dish with sweet soy sauce, eggs, and vegetables), which I have ordered at countless Thai restaurants across the nation. The Pad See Ew at Sala Thai was not up to par --- In fact, it was below average. The same dish is so much better/tastier at Monsoon Siam and/or Ha Long Bay. The service was also incredibly slow, even though when we arrived everyone else in the restaurant had already gotten their food but it still took ages to order and receive our dishes. Despite hearing great things about Sala Thai, I left disappointed."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Sala Thai! Fresh ingredients, spicy, and authentic fare!  Being new to Madison, my husband and I searched for a good Thai restaurant. We were afraid that even the Thai restaurants here may suffer from being \"midwestern bland\". We frequented Sa Bai Thong for a while, and recently discovered Sala Thai on Fair Oaks.     We are big fans of spicy food, and ordered the squid salad as an appetizer. It was amazing- sweet, spicy, and full of fresh ingredients- lettuce, tomato, red onion, lemongrass, squid, with small (priki-new) peppers that will make your face sweat! Following our appetizer, we ordered Som Tum (from the Laotian menu) and Gang Ped (green curry is the best and spicy enough without a special request). The Som Tum is an unknown gem of grilled marinated chicken over a bed of spicy papaya salad (don't fool yourself into thinking a salad isn't spicy here). Again, fresh ingredients (when you know what items to order!) and excellent flavor. The Gang Ped is my go-to curry dish- spicy while still comforting, fattening with no skimping on the coconut milk. I crave this dish- and it has become the dish I order regularly when we visit.   While this is a family restaurant that can get overwhelmed on a busy night, the staff are always friendly if you are.  Be sure to bring cash, and be sure to order the squid salad!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed our lunch with out the kids today here. It was amazing! Everything from the egg rolls to the soup to the peanut chicken and cashew chicken.  Plenty of food. So much I have lunch for tomorrow.  Very nice quite place will be back for sure.    Thank you"}
{"text":"The food was good, but it wasn't great. Something about our entrees was just...off. I ordered the yellow chicken curry and my better half ordered the chicken stuffed with pork and shrimp. The food came out in a timly fashion, so I couldn't understand why it wasn't as hot (temperature) wise as I had expected, and my dish was not as spicy as I had hoped either.  Surprisingly, the spring rolls we shared were fantastic. Fresh, light, and pretty to look at.   My favorite part of the trip to Sala Thai did not come from the food, but rather the patron that left the restaurant, went to their car, and came back in to pay with change from a glass jar. Ohhh the East side."}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended from a few friends of mine.  Clearly, due to my 3 star review, I wasn't impressed. It wasn't terrible, but it certainly didn't deserve a higher mark.  Menu seemed substantial, the wine list could use some work (I get it, people probably don't come for the wine, but if you are going to offer, you might as well do it right). Upon seeing the sign located on a pole right at the point of entry that read \"cash or check only\", my husband and I needed to quickly rethink our choices, as we, like most people these days, don't carry a ton of cash on us.  We decided to split and appetizer and split pad thai (one of our favorite dishes). The appetizer was all deep fried (not expecting this and this was not part of the description). The pad thai was alright, nothing special. The server didn't ask us if we wanted a certain star/level of spice - there was zero kick to this dish, something that I very much look forward to when eating Thai inspired dishes.  Again, just okay. Probably won't visit again, but I'm not sad we experienced dinner in this location."}
{"text":"Had the Green Curry and it is hot!!  My sinuses were cleared out by the pepper but it was so good.  Carrot, zucchini, green beans, and bamboo shoots with a large serving of rice and chicken made this dish wonderful.  The tofu, tomato, and chicken in a chicken broth soup preceded the meal with crab rangoons (4 large handmade come on the appetizer menu).  Hot Jasmine tea and water with an ever pleasant orange slice rounded out the meal.  Had leftovers!  Update: They no longer accept Credit or Debit cards.  Only cash or check."}
{"text":"Cash or check only joint. I read reviews and came prepared.   The service was a tad slow and we were the first ones there. The waitress did the best she could considering she was waiting on everyone solo.   I ordered crab rangoons and the green curry. The crab rangoons were normal but not anything out of the ordinary. The green curry was delicious! Spicy and savory. I drank a few glasses of water to combat the spice but it was so worth it. I would definitely go back for the curry alone. It was a nice portion as well. I am a fan!"}
{"text":"Good neighborhood restaurant with easy on-street parking.  I am a big fan of the curry squash to the point of craving it at times - it is spicy, creamy and delicious, as well as the cucumber salad  I tend to avoid noodle dishes there as the noodles always seemed overcook and soggy, and we don't care for the pad thai which is otherwise a staple for the kids when we go to other Thai restaurants. Service is very hit or miss.  It can be quiet slow to get service and food even when there are only a few other customers.  Once when trying to pick up carry out and waited 20 minutes past the time I was told to pick it up, I was told quite sharply that it was \"not ready, go sit down!\".  Still, that curry is quite yummy ...."}
{"text":"Sala Thai is amazing! The food was delicious and incredibly flavorful, the staff was super sweet and responsive, and the atmosphere was well-thought out and interesting. I had the Laotian green papaya salad with grilled chicken and sticky rice, and it was out of this world. Super fresh with the right amount of spice (they didn't hold back, which was appreciated), and very filling with the rice. And the chicken was ridiculously flavorful and very moist for being grilled, with a nice crust on it. I would order it again in a second if I didn't want to try everything else on the menu. Also, there was a pretty good selection of local beers, and for a good price. I would recommend this place to anyone that likes fresh, filling, and healthy food."}
{"text":"I love this place.  My biggest complaint is that the hours are limited!  The Tom Kha Tofu is amazing.  Rich, but not heavy, perfectly spicy, and wonderfully complex, not to mention generously portioned even as takeout.  Other places seem to give me just a pint when I get takeout as opposed to a full portion.  I'm not sure why.  My other dish of choice is the green curry with tofu.  Lots of well cooked veggies and nicely textured fried tofu swimming in slightly sweet coconut curry that marries a soothing texture with nose-tingling spice?  Yes please.  Service can be a bit slow, but I seem to find myself there at either really dead times (not a lot of kitchen staff to expedite food prep) or times when they're absolutely slammed.  It is especially worth noting that even during the very busy times, the food has never been less than tasty.  The veggies might not be as elegantly sliced, but that's all secondary.  It tastes just as good, and I appreciate that they take a few extra minutes to make sure the food meets standards.    Nice atmosphere, delicious food.  Limited hours and sometimes slow service bring it down a star, but it's still one of my favorite restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"Ate here last night. DEEE-licious. The Thai fish patties (Tod Mun) are delectable. This is the only place in Madison that serves them, as far as I know. The Pad Wun Sen was Hella hot, and so good. And I only ordered it 3 out of 5 stars spicy! Yow.  A Singha beer goes well with all that hot. And a BIG glass of water. :)  I think that the service has improved vastly since this place first opened- I'd take some of the older reviews about that with a grain of salt."}
{"text":"Sala Thai is a hidden gem along the bike path!  Although I don't want others to know about my new favorite Thai place, Sala deserves some recognition.  I'm shocked that I'm only the second person to give a review.  The restaurant itself is small and charming, with a matriarch behind the register who seems to always have something interesting to say.  So far I've tried the chicken pad see ew and red tofu curry-both were delicious with lots of fresh veggies and full of flavor!     Just remember, they are a cash only business so plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"Went to this place after searching for a thai eatout in Madison  Service & Ambience - 5  Food - 3  Something was missing or different..  Maybe its the ingredients they use .. It just didnt feel great.. the panang curry was extremely thick .. The Pad see ew was not good.. the fried rice had an interesting flavor.. .. The rice was very sticky though with the red paste.."}
{"text":"Don't come here when you're already starving, unless you can handle the wait. But once your food arrives you will understand why it really is worth the wait.  I've tried several dishes but the Squash Curry will always be my favorite. Ever since moving from Madison to Chicago I practically dream of this place. One really strange thing about Chicago, NO ONE has squash curry. Once you eat at Sala Thai you'll wonder why Squash Curry isn't a staple on all Thai menus. It might not be a traditional Thai restaurant but it's the perfect coming together of two cuisines. I mean, why not put some delicious hearty squash in a rich creamy curry?"}
{"text":"I placed a to go order to pick up 40 minutes later. When I arrived, the woman told me they hadn't started my order. I asked why she hadn't called to let me know and she said she had been busy. She did not apologize, just offered to start my order then. I declined."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant when I was in Madison, and i went back recently and was still over the moon about the food.  Their squash curry is second to none. Everything I've ever ordered is delicious.  The service can be slow because they usually only have 1 or 2 servers for the whole restaurant, but the food and the ambiance make up for it.  Their curry puffs are scrumptious. The massaman curry is a real stew and completely and utterly slow-cooked deliciousness.  I knew the the owners back when they owned the corner store on Williamson street, and they are very kind and sweet people.  Their prices are also very reasonable!  (A few dollars for an appetizer and 10 or less for an entree!)"}
{"text":"Wonderful Thai meal, relaxing music, great attentive service. Will visit definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Would probably go there once in awhile if I lived down the block... But I don't... And I won't waste another trip there. Small portions, slow service, and not that great 'Thai' food. Prices weren't that great either.   One reviewer complained about the spiciness. I had the opposite experience- warned by the waitress how spicy one dish was supposed to be at which point I said no problem... my 11 year old wouldn't have even thought it was spicy.     Interestingly, I ate at Thai Basil later same day (as I didn't get my Thai craving met here), where I asked for extra spicy larb...holy@$##% was that hot!! Took me about 30 min to eat it with my eyes watering and my tongue and lips practically blistered but it tasted awesome. I will go back there again (albeit will remove the 'extra ' word...)"}
{"text":"The decor, especially in the view from the table by the door at the fountain, was like being in another world.   So was the spring roll.  Fantastic texture - - substantial, fresh, bursting - - with a delicately sweet/savory sauce.   I asked for a recommendation and at first thought that the green bamboo-shoot-predominant coconut curry would be too monotone, but over time it was sublime.  The combination of curry, coconut, shoot, and mint eventually becomes complex, numbing, and intoxicating.   Great service, nice atomosphere, well-prepared food."}
{"text":"Coming here with a great expectation after being recommended by my supervisor on campus and reading some reviews from some elites, I am afraid to say that this place doesn't leave some good impression with me.  We were welcomed by the waitresses. Very nice and warm.  There were a family who came only two minutes before us and a couple only five minutes after us.  So, we were the second customers. However, we were the last customer served.  I understood that they received many take-outs too, but waiting for 40 minutes for two kinds of orders was a little bit too much.   Right before we sat, we noticed a notification glued on the wall: No credit card/debit card. Only Cash and Check. Good to remember, for any future visits.  We were then seated by the window. I appreciated the effort of the owner to make this place as Thai as possible with all the Thai decorations. Good job on the decoration. The place is also clean.   Next, the service. We were served by one of the waitresses- which I guess was the owner (maybe?) because she is the oldest and looks very authoritative compared to other staff. She is a very nice and funny lady. She is very \"touchy\" to my husband :) which I suppose because we look Asian! and we are:) She greeted us and asked my husband right away: Are you Thai? and touched my husband's shoulder. A very friendly gesture viewing it from the Asian's perspective (I only hope she doesn't do this to others hehehe) We ordered chicken egg rolls and Thai tea for starter. Ehm, unfortunately, it wasn't too yummy. It was cheaper though: We got four pieces for only 3 bucks.  I know other place has better egg rolls.  The Thai tea was not great either. Just so so.  My husband ordered some curry chicken fried rice. I ordered some seafood curry.  Both of us agreed that this dining experience was not impressive at all.  We may be back to try what other Yelpers have suggested: to try their chicken yellow curry. We know for sure we are not going to try their Seafood curry and the fried rice.  We want to give it another try- but not in the near future!"}
{"text":"They complete takeout orders before people sitting in the restaurant. Waited over an hour before food came out. Very slow kitchen and no sense of prioritizing orders. And then they force you to pay the 18% included tip."}
{"text":"Been here twice and loved their curry puff and my friends loved the chicken satay!!! The main course was like okay compared to the appetizers. Good Thai tea!! Pricey but the quantity is good. And the appetizers fill you before the main food comes. Love the ambience. Not really bothered about ye wait time because the taste is worth it. Good place to go to once in a while"}
{"text":"We ordered a few dishes for pick-up for a get together we were having and it worked really well. The Pad Thai was also okay, a bit too sour and not sweet enough for me. For better Pad Thai, I'd go to Sa-Bai Thong. The curry's we ordered, however, were great.  They had just the right amount of heat and tasted amazing!"}
{"text":"Love Sala Thai! Best green curry ever!!!! Very cozy, you feel like it's home and you're family!"}
