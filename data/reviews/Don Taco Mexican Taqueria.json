{"text":"Nothing says SUMMER! quite like walking up Augusta, suddenly ducking into a vendor's kiosk, ordering a taco, scarfing it down while continuing up the avenue, and licking the last bit sauce off the plate. These little round plates of corn meal and tomato-chili sauce coupled with cilantro and chicken hit the spot for me, especially when a burger and fries take too long to order, too long to eat, and, well, you shouldn't go swimming with a full stomach, they say... Don Taco Mexican Taqueria takes the place of the stellar Seven Lives Tacos who occupied the space along with the Mexican bakery (churro guys) who anchor the building. Don does a great job of whipping up a perfect taco, quick and cheap, just what I wanted."}
{"text":"I loved the delicious cactus taco I had at Don Taco today!  And it was only $3!  If the weather's nice (as it was today) there's a great patio in the back of this food court.  I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Ordered a bunch of churros with my friends. Store listed that there was condensed milk but they said it wasnt in stock so we settled with chocolate and caramel.

When i got mines, only the top ~5cm of the churro had chocolate!! Mannnn I got GYPPED!! Ate the rest of the dry churro.......

So not cool, bro. Good thing there's lots of other places around here that offers churros and at least they have a doorknob so you can enter the store easier than this one."}
{"text":"Quite a hole in the wall place - I almost didn't realize that there was a taqueria in the back because it looked so unlike a restaurant. 

The front part serves premade empanadas, but the gold star goes to their churros - only 1.50$ or 4 for 5$, and they stuff them with caramel or chocolate syrup too. Their tacos were pretty delicious - pleasantly spicy and on a soft tortilla. If you're around Kensington Market, give this place a try!"}
