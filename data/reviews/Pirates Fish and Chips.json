{"text":"I like their fish, and I think the red sauce is really good.  It's nice to have a fish and chips place on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Place has gone down hill fast. Staff quality has diminished terribly. Zucchini tasted burnt. Fries were hard and cold. Fish had no flavor sauces all seem watered down. Order was wrong. It has really taken on a filthy appearance outside, I can only imagine what it looks like inside. Not worth the wait or the cost. Place won't be here long unless owners clean  it up, improve food quality and service."}
{"text":"Wow! I read the bad reviews, but had to see for myself. I am sorry I did! You could do better buying frozen fish fillets from the grocery store and cooking them in the oven. I wish I was exaggerating, but I am not. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I never tried their fish but their hamburgers are great. Their prices are pretty low also. I go every week for their pirate burger."}
{"text":"The worst fish and chips I have ever had. I watched them drop a frozen square fish patty in a deep fat fryer. McDonald's has better fish than this place. And what's up with the red sauce. I had to ask for tatar sauce. I love fish and chips. But its been hard to find good fish and chips in AZ. Best Ive had is in British Columbia. Your better off going to Red Robin or Denny's for fish and chips. Dont waist your time and money. Pretty pricey for the quality of food. If your gonna specialize in fish and chips at least make it fresh. Maybe actually look like a fillet. Maybe use a nice tempura batter."}
{"text":"Have been to Pirates during the day and it is always good. I went this past Saturday night and the service was pathetic. There were 3 young adult workers in there just talking. The female worker was telling the two boys that work with her that she doesn't like being married. I mean I got the whole story and only 1 out of the  3 workers was working. Waited longer then I ever had and when we tried the onion rings they were not hot nor was the shrimp! Normally you have to wait awhile for food to cool off but not tonight! Very disappointed with food and service tonight!"}
{"text":"The food is okay for a what it is - a copy of Pete's Fish and Chips. My complaint is with the service. Out of about 8 trips to Pirate's I have never once had any of the workers say \"thank you\", \"have a nice day\", or \"can I help you with anything else.\" Apparently, they do not understand the concept of customer service."}
{"text":"It's pirates! This place has been here longer than you lived in chandler more than likely! Not the best fish and chips . but still hits the spot ."}
{"text":"Horrible food! Frozen fish squares -even home cooked frozen fish sticks are way better than what this place has to offer. Tartar sauce was watered down and had a nasty artificial flavor. Even at the low prices I could not ever recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am usually one to ignore and just quietly walk away to not visit an establishment. But not this time. How they pass food inspection is beyond me. This is the dirtiest restaraunt I have been too. The cabinets are black with gone, there is a quarter inch of black gunk build up on the legs of the equipment. Had I seen this before I paid and picked up my order I would have walked. I watched a server (not mine) suck his fingers while eating and dropping onion rings in the fryer. He did not want them before he went to the freezer handle and reached in the bag with the same saliva ridden hand. I could see in a mirror that he was eating in the back from prep areas on top of the food prep surface. I mentioned this to the staff and her laughed it off. I couldn't find a clean table to sit. You couldn't throw away your trash without getting gunk on your hands from the trash can.   This will be last visit"}
{"text":"First off, Pirates fish and chips has pleasant outdoor seating, and contrary to the info about the restaurant, it is all outdoor seating.  The misters were nice, the staff were a bit on the extremely casual side but it had two pick up windows, one for ordering, and one for picking up your food, that was pretty smart.  I ordered the Super seafood combo, a normal seafood combo and a 2 Pc fish and chips.  My party sat down, and after waiting around 7mins our food came out.  The portions were enormous.  My food contained 2 Pc fish, 7 shrimp and a LOT of fries.  In concurrence with the previous review, the sauce was watery and there is a rumor that they actually have shrimp in their \"breaded shrimp\" but the fish was fine and the fries were crisp and golden.  All of the food I got was piping hot too, in fact we ended up taking the 2 Pc home!  Even though the service was fair And the shrimp MIA, I give them 4 stars, even though the previous review was one-sided."}
{"text":"I only had this place once and it was because my brother in law is a fried food junkie and he loves these places, so he brought home a meal for me to try. I've been to Petes and I wasn't impressed with it and I thought the prices were high for such a simple meal. I rarely go out for fish n' chips because I have to be in the mood for it.  If the prices are like other fish and chip restaurants, I imagine it wasn't very cheap, and reading other reviews I'm probably right. So I got I guess a 3 piece fish combo. Nothing special about my order. I tried a fry first, I usually like soggy fries, but this one tasted rather bland. Then the other, and so on. I ate all my fries first (I'm weird like that) and started on the square-looked like it came from a box of fish at the store-fish fillets. Mine weren't hard and burnt like some people on here are saying, but all I could really taste was the salty breading they use on them. I don't know if its because I'm not a huge fried food person, but the whole meal was rather bland. I wish my brother in law and sister picked better restaurants because they wasted so much $ on junk. If there's better fish and chips out here, I hope to come across it because Mesa sucks for that stuff"}
{"text":"Not the best.  If you want fish n' chips and its close, go for it.  While its not my favorite place, I do enjoy their fish as long as it not over cooked like 60% of the time. Two stars because its not great but has never been horrible for me either."}
{"text":"Honestly, the food didn't have much taste to it. For years I have been going to Petes fish and chips and found that their food looks exactly the same so I figured I would try pirates. Although they may look exactly the same that doesn't mean they are. Petes food is amazing compared to this place. Don't be fooled and eat at Petes if you want fish and chips."}
{"text":"This place is awful!   The fish looks like it is just square frozen fish, deep fried to rock hardness.   The shrimp are all breading... take the breading off and you will find very small, almost popcorn shrimp.  They do have a good racket going.   They sell you tasteless fish then when you back to get tartar sauce they try to charge you .25 for a packet of sauce.   A fish place that charges for tartar sauce...  kinda funny actually.  Oh I asked for no ice in my Pepsi, I got extra ice instead.   Oh well.  A one and done dining experience.  I donated $21 for 2 meals... most of it went in the trash can."}
{"text":"Minus 10; When you come here it's hit and miss with the service and food. Let's start with the service....Three young people working and goofing around, the young man on the drive thru ask if I wanted sweet or unsweetened tea. I said unsweetened he entered sweet. When I got to the window he took my money. Said \"here's your sweet tea. I said I ordered unsweetened. He started bitching that I asked for sweet he tapped the order slip and she said sweet. Oh so SORRY THAT YOU WEREN'T LISTENING. And had to make a new one.  Ordered the chicken combination chicken was over cooked almost burnt. Shrimp was four little  strips friend said if it had not tasted like shrimp would have thought clams fries limp and lukewarm. Sorry to say that for sixteen dollars one meal in trash the other barely edible.  Last time here as I was getting my food the young lady who was working did something to the other young man he dropped the order for the car behind me and picked it up from the floor and placed it back in the serving basket.. and was laughing at what he was doing."}
{"text":"Awful management..they dont care about their customers or apologize when a mistake is made. Watched the guy handling money touch and serve  food."}
{"text":"Tried this place yesterday and everything was fantastic. Everything was hot and not too greasy. Special sauce was soo good. The husband and I were trying to figure out how to replicate it. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a Pete' Fish and Chips wannabe that did not make it. Very fishy fish. Once was enough."}
{"text":"This place was WAY better than Pete's....neither place is  very fancy, BUT the fish is so much better here than at Pete's! Unbelievable that neither place offers tartar sauce standard. Another review here did make a good point that Pirate's also takes debit card which is nice compared to Pete's cash only."}
{"text":"I actually like the food here but the only negative I have with this place is that the drive thru is so freaking slow don't come here if you're starving, don't have a whole lot of patience and you don't have time to get out otherwise skip this place like the plague"}
{"text":"One star, because 0 stars isn't an option.   Every other 1 star review will have the same sad tale of fried tasteless fish squares that don't come with tarter sauce.  Tartar is an extra fee... You get Pirate sauce instead. Pirate sauce is the weakest watery version of the red sauce you get from a Filly B's.  The fries don't even give this place something to save face.  Honestly? My boyfriend and I went thinking it was a Pete's fish and chips and we were craving it so badly we decided that Pirate's should do the trick.  We were gravely mistaken. I repeat: DO NOT TRUST PIRATES WITH YOUR FISH OR YOUR CHIPS. THEY WILL RUIN THEM, THEN THEY WILL RUIN YOU.  Shame on us for not checking Yelp before we let this place rob is out of $15 dollars and a tasty dinner."}
{"text":"I'd really been craving fish & chips and was excited to see one right next to the store I was scrapbooking at all day on Saturday.   First off I was annoyed that there was no where inside to sit. But they have pretty good misters, so ok. I stand there looking at the menu, but have to wait for the worker guy to finish flirting with the girl at the counter before I can give my order.   I ordered the combo that contains 1 fish, 4 shrimp, fries and a drink. I'm sitting at the table reading my book with my earphones in waiting for my food, because they said they would bring it to my table. So it's been a while and I turn around to look back at the place and they are standing in the window with my food. Boo.   The only condiments that came with my food were some sauces that was very thin, kinda like a hot sauce? But not real hot. No condiments anywhere else and no one at the window anymore. So I sit down to eat. These are shrimp? Really? I couldn't tell with all the breading. They taste like nothing. Literally, they have no flavor at all. The fish was ok, but way overcooked. It was pretty dark. The fries were good, the only thing in the meal worth anything. Oh, and the Dr. Pepper was good, but it's hard to mess up the Nectar of the Gods!   I ended throwing away half my food which I NEVER do (and if you've seen me, you know). Will not be going back, ever. Except maybe for Dr. Pepper."}
{"text":"The other reviews are pretty spot on... this place was downright baaaddd. A buddy and I went there for lunch and I was pretty stoked to eat some fish and chips. The menu was what I expected and there were a decent number of combinations and options. Prices were pretty good. That is where the good ends though.   The fish and chips comes with the 'special sauce' and you have to pay an extra 50 cents to get a side of tartar sauce. 50 cents isn't a big deal but really what kind of fish and chips doesn't come with tartar sauce included!? That said, the tartar sauce was decent. There is only outside seating and most of the tables were pretty dirty. When our food came I was instantly turned off by the square fish pieces...it just screamed of store-bought frozen fish pieces. My buddy got the chicken tenders and they looked (and tasted) like an inferior version of the bags of tyson frozen chicken tenders you can get at most grocery stores. The special sauce was sort of a runny ketchup, it was OK but I think I would have just preferred ketchup for my fries. The fish was very bleh. Tasted like old frozen fish. The battering was OK but there was way too much salt that had been sprinkled on top...maybe to mask the old fish taste?   Apparently this place has a decent community following, but if you're looking for some good fish and chips I'd avoid this place like the plague. Some of the worst fish I've ever had."}
{"text":"So I went here for lunch with some friends and was not impressed at all. I got the crab and chips, don't know why I thought it was going to be real crab. Anyways it was just deep fried imitation crab. No flavor and the fries were bland."}
{"text":"This place has terrible reviews across the board! I don't understand it. Sure this place isn't great, but It sure ain't bad! Since everyone on here compares all fish and chips to Pete's, I guess I'll do the same. (Side note, Pete's is lame)  The fish is standard fast food fish. That is a frozen square of battered fish. Basically a large fish stick. These are virtually identical to the ones Pete's Fish and Chips serves.   The chicken tenders were pretty good. Again, I've had better, but they are far from terrible. Again, on par with Pete's.  Fried shrimp. They are just fine too.  Fries. These were good. Nice and salty. Not those soggy thin ones like Pete's. I've always hated Pete's fries. These are far superior.  Pirate sauce is basically Pete's sauce.   And the number one best thing about this place....THEY TAKE DEBIT. Pete's cash only nonsense pisses me right the hell off. I'll take this place over Pete's just on this principle along.   SUCK IT PETE'S.  I'd also like to point out that anyone complaining about this place being greasy is an idiot. It's fried food. Find me some that ISN'T greasy.  And the guy who tried to compare the Pirate sauce to Filiberto's red is also an idiot. Apples and oranges. This is a basically a cocktail sauce. Filiberto's is a hot sauce. Big difference.   Either I came here on a particularly good day, or everyone else just has unreasonable expectations from a fast food fried fish facility. Everything I got was exactly what I expected. What I expected was high end mediocrity.   If you like Pete's more than this you are wrong and hate debit cards and yourself. You probably don't like kittens or puppies either. Or The Beatles. Who doesn't like The Beatles? You monster.  3 stars because meh."}
{"text":"To start with the Chandler location is better. I stopped for lunch using the drive thru window. I ordered a 2 pc. fish and chips, cheeseburger and small 14 oz. Pepsi. I payed the tab and received the food and the Pepsi. The small 14 oz. Pepsi was a in an 8 oz. cup. I told the cashier that is not 14 ounces as the menu states. Her reply was \"I don't know why the menu says that, it just does\". Unbelievable dishonesty and deception. The food was way over cooked. I won't be back. Pete's Fish and Chips is much better."}
{"text":"We had a craving for one of our favorites Pirates shrimp and chips, but it was a bit late, so I called and asked them when they closed, they stated 10 o'clock. We live relatively close so we hopped in the car, and drove there.   When we arrived, before 10:00 PM, they were closed with their security windows rolled down and all. I can understand wanting to end your night and get off of work, but they closed before their stated closing hours. Must not need to be open."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is so busy. Maybe because there aren't any other fish places around. Not much seating, all seating is outdoors, the trash cans have flies and are close to the seating. Not handicap friendly. Watching the staff in the back grossed me out. Not a lot of cleanliness going on back there. Lots of handling frozen meat products, handling cash, and handling cooked foods and no hand washing in between. Staff are clearly visible by pick up window, and I saw not once did they use gloves. I am pretty sure this place would flunk health inspection."}
{"text":"For what they are (inexpensive fast food) they have great cheap burgers. I would stop there over the usual chains. You can also ask for grilled onions on your burger and those were really good.   No tomato, though. They have a private sauce that is kind of spicy so if you don't like spice, go for ketchup instead."}
{"text":"Excellent deep fry shrimp and sauce. Fries ok. One order fed wife and I. Good for lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on a Wednesday. There is a walk up window to place your order and a pick up window. There is only outdoor seating with several picnic tables under a canopy. They are reasonably priced. I ordered a fish sandwich. When I got my sandwich and I opened the wrapper I found a smashed bun, with ketchup and mustard seeping out the sides. It also had onions and pickles on it which I did not order and did not know they would be on there as the menu didn't say these items were on the sandwich. This fish was not the best, it's basically frozen battered fish that's been deep fried.  It wasn't the best, but not horrible either."}
{"text":"Horrible food. The fish was extremely oily, as well as the fries. Never going back. The food was tasteless and dry."}
{"text":"Come on Pirates!  Joint has potential, freezer case fries are tolerable, but the over-fried/battered tasteless Mrs. Paul's wanabe is not worth the price nor the visit.  After getting my order, reluctantly wishing to enjoy this 'fishy' meal got worse with the totally filthy seating/eating area - dirty and grungy floors, grimy tables, unwiped doorway and a trash can you don't want to go near to put trash into!  Health department where are you?  If you don't believe me, see my pics.  My re-visiting this place is best described in the words of the Raven: 'nevermore'!"}
{"text":"Friday rolls around and we wanted fish. Saw an ad for Pirates's fish & Chips so North on Lindsay and as soon as I walked to the window to order, I was saying I should have kept going. Our microwaved over cooked orders came out in minutes. The coating to fish ratio was at least 2 to 1. My combo has 2 fillets and it was impossible to determine which was fish and which was chicken. The fries were average. Where did the great fish & chip places go?"}
{"text":"I wish I had checked yelp before I stopped in. This is the first place I have gone to where I felt like I was robbed of my money for the food quality. The quality of taste is on par with frozen food from the supermarket if that. How they are still in business is questionable."}
{"text":"If I could get less than one star I would.     I just stopped there last night for a quick bite to eat. The staff was busy on their cell phones not processing orders. I ordered tartar sauce got charged for tartar sauce and realized when I got home but there was no tartar sauce. My items had been pierced by the tongs in the fryer so everything was greasy. I think the only reason this place is still in business is it's near a high school where kids don't care what they eat."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money!   This isn't even standard fast food fish!!!!  For those who read reviews,  I would NOT feed this food to my dog and I would certainly NOT consider  any of Nathan S. Reviews about pirates!  Pete's over Pirates all day long!!!!  This place is terrible! I'll make Vandecamps frozen before I go back to Pirates!!!!!  Would have given it 0 stars but it wouldn't let me!"}
{"text":"Well I wouldn't give it less than a 3' but not more than 3 stars either. This is an average fish and chips joint. A nice place to get a cheap lunch. The fish is frozen ,breaded and manufactured. It is the same thing you get from Schwann's or Sysco. The fries were pretty good. This is as good as any food truck, but without the wheels. I'll be back sometime. FYI, they charge extra for tartar sauce."}
{"text":"Go somewhere else. My wife and I got the mixed combo but might as well been only one thing. The shrimp, fries, and fish all tasted the same. Not to mention the kitchen looks disgusting probably because it is ran by teenagers. We didn't even finish our single basket of food."}
