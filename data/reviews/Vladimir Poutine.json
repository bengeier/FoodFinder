{"text":"We were very intrigued by the  restaurant name & the dishes (named after politicians) & we decided to go. We were among the first few customers & locating the restaurant was very confusing. We did not see anyone & called out & then were given a table. It is very dimly lit & with the small space feels very dark. We ordered & very soon the place was full of people. The music was very loud & gave us bad headaches. We had Nikita, Das & Hirohito. One Burger & 2 Poutine  dishes. Food was pretty good & we enjoyed it. The desert we ordered Banana Split Ice creme ."}
{"text":"We went because the name was fun and the concept was irresistible. Their Poutine's have flavours that you would  normally not think of combining. 
The burgers were good but nothing to write home about. And the burger I ordered cost $19 and was served on a cold bun. I was disappointed that at that price they were not homemade fries though they were very good.

Though rain was looming, no staff prepared for the possibility of a down pour by opened the awnings to protect the customers seated outside until the customers asked for it.

There are no facilities for people with reduced mobility and in this day and age for me, that is unacceptable. There are only two tables on the ground level so if you have reduced mobility you cannot access the tables upstairs nor the washroom facilities down stairs.

The staff is very friendly but we waited over 50  minutes before our food arrived. We went slightly after lunch time and the staff was running around appearing to be either understaffed or not quite sure how this restaurant business works.

 I have been to several restaurants recently where at the time of presenting the bill,  they apologize for being short of staff as an excuse for the tardiness of the service and they don't want it to affect their tips."}
{"text":"Really great variations on Poutine, lovely outside dining area. Moscow Mule was a bit weak, but the staff were excellent attentive and caring- food was good. Definitely go back"}
{"text":"Honestly I don't know if this was the most perfect dinner theater or the poorest example of food service management I have ever seen.  I arrived at 5:30 on a busy Saturday (Formula 1 Weekend) and offered to take the bar or a table as I was a single.  

I was seated at a table and forgotten.   5 Minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes and low and behold a employee offered me water.   A good 10 minutes later I got my chance to order.  Calamari, poutine and a beer.   I panned to eat quick and be in my way, but the gods of dining had other plans.  

I was very hungry at this point so I can't be sure of time, but my beer was gone and finally my poutine arrived.  The poutine.  The calamari?  Nope.  Chef said the server put it in wrong so no dice.  I could have a free beer on the house though.  Sad but not broken, I accepted the beer and then half way through the poutine what should arrive?   Calamari of course.  (As to the food - it was passable - but now I'm here for the show). 

I begin noticing similar troubles around me.  About 6 guys at the jock/bro table next to me finally cancel their order and walk across the street for pizza.  The table of four towards the back seem to have made less progress than me.  I figure I better get my check since the nice ladies sitting next to me finished their meal 20 minutes ago and can't catch a waiters eye.  

The table next to me (I come to find out 2 own their own restaurants in other towns) start laughing about the titanic and rearranging chairs when the staff starts breaking down the table of 12 while people are waiting for food and checks. A great bond has developed amongst the table of forgotten diners.  The dude in the white t-shirt (manager?) is glad handing a lot of people he seems to know, but is painfully unaware of the sinking ship around him

I finally catch the hostess as she rushes by and offer her a 10 dollar tip if she can get me and the ladies next to me our bills in less than 5 minutes.  She was sort of successful and the ladies were able to split their check and high tail it off the patio.  I waited... and waited.   Finally  I got my bill, bid goodby to my new found fellows and left.   

Post script: I did honor my promise to the hostess, because, well she was frazzled and probably needed her own drink tonight."}
{"text":"We're visiting from the US and happened by this intriguing restaurant. After looking at the humorously named menu items, my husband and I knew we had to try it out. From the moment we walked in, the atmosphere is very modern with and old Russian twist. We were seated immediately and service was impeccable. We ordered the soup du jour (potato parsley heaven), the Nikita (delicious salmon and veggies), and, of course, the Vladimir Poutine (ridiculously tasty house poutine). And the atmosphere was just perfect, with delightful, if not slightly off-norm, music and relaxed staff. We could not have enjoyed ourselves more in this wonderful new restaurant. When we return to Montreal in the future, we will definitely comeback to this gem."}
{"text":"Amazing food and a one of a kind place. I really wish we had something similar back in the United States!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. 

To start off, I am a big fan of Le Gras Dur and frequently dine there. After hearing they were expanding into Vladimir Poutine I was extremely excited. However Vladimir Poutine does not live up to Gras Dur. My friend and I ordered two different types of poutine. We were both shocked at what we received. It almost looked like they ran out of ingredients to make the different types of poutine, but served them anyways. It was more a bowl of fries then poutine. Both poutines had little to no sauce, with no toppings. Even the fries tasted off. We only ended up eating 1/3rd and threw the rest in the garbage. 
However, the worst part of this experience was the service. The two gentleman working the tables were rude and unorganized. It almost felt like we were wasting their time by ordering and eating here. We spent more time trying to get their attention then we actually did eating. Upon asking for the bill, the one gentleman just handed me the bill by reaching from behind my back, without saying a word. After 15 minutes had gone by I decided to ask if we were supposed to go up to the counter to pay or something.. he replied by saying, \"no... to be honest.. I just forgot you guys were even here\".  

$45 dollars for this type of service and food is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Great service!  Great staff!  Great food!  

Beautifully decorated.  We arrived just as they opened so we were able to sit in the alcove area next to the windows.  The windows on that whole wall have a scenic Russian decal across them so it looks like your overlooking St. Basil's Cathedral.

I ordered the large serving of Rasputin Poutine.  It was served in a metal pan so it kept the food hot for a long time.  The layers of cheese and gravy went all the way to the bottom of the dish so it wasn't just sitting on top.  Very yummy!

My husband ordered the Trump Burger :-). It came served on a cutting board with a small salad salad.  The burger was 'tall' and had a knife stuck thru the top to hold it together.  Great presentation!  Also very good!

By sharing both of our dishes, we had a delicious lunch in a lovely setting.  The place was packed about 30 min after we arrived so be sure to get there early if you go there for lunch."}
{"text":"The Napoleon poutines were amazing, and so was the DAS sandwich. The so-called \"white\" sangria, not that amazing. 
Highly recommended though."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie but I dragged my husband here because of the name but we liked the poutine selections. The serving size was big enough for us to share but we still got our own because we wanted to try different kinds. The location is a great location too; walking distance to shops, etc."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The food portions were very generous! We were the only table being sat in the place when we got there. We were a little concerned that no one else was there but after a bit a few other folks came in. It was a rainy afternoon so that may had had an impact. I had the Trump burger and it was HUGE.  And it was also very good. Neat location and the staff was very friendly. I would totally recommend the place. Check it out!"}
{"text":"The food is inventive, but poorly excecuted.

First of all, we came on a nice summer evening so we sat outside. Real chill and comfortable. Not sure how the indoors seating works, it looks like it's part of \"le Cinq\"? 
Service was relaxed, but they seem to come at the wrong times. We got asked if everything is okay by a different server every single time, so that was a bit amusing. When we wanted to get the bill (we had a movie to catch), the people seemed to appear a lot less frequently. 

We started with the duck confit blueberry nem rolls. Basically two spring rolls filled with duck, with a blueberry sauce on the bottom. They were really one dimensional, I thought the duck confit would be amazing but it turned out kind of bland. The sauce wasn't very complimentary either, it was a bit bitter, I was hoping for a tart and sweet flavour to boost the dish. 2 rolls for $12. hm

Next, we got small size poutines in mao zhe dong and fidel. 
Both poutines has great flavours, but for the price we're paying, I do hope there were more toppings!
The Fidel was supposed to have shrimp and scallops, but everytime we thought we found a piece...it was just a cheese curd. I think in total there were 4 tiny pieces. The flavour was delcious though. The lobster bisque that stands in for the gravy was a good choice. 
The mao zhe dong have barbeque pork, and foie gras. Also the same complaint here, too little toppings! We got 3 extremely thin slices of pork :( Then again, the foie gras infused sauce was delicious.

Anyways, the poutines were very filling because of all the fries (we could only finish half of it). Since the restaurant feels more high end than regular poutine joints, they should focus on the toppings that really make the dishes stand out. Keep doing what you're doing with the sauces though!"}
{"text":"We had a bit of mixed experience here, but I'll be generous and go with 4 stars. Really, I'd say more like 3.5.

On a positive note, the name and overall concept is really fun. We were drawn in mainly by the name and the unique menu of poutines. We arrived around 9 on a Saturday night and were seated outside on the patio at a table that we later found out was weirdly located right in the middle of the entrance to da Club that's also in the same building. I was looking forward to experiencing the interior, but my friend wanted to enjoy some people watching and it was a nice night, so I was cool with outside. 

The hostess cleared a table for us very quickly and our server came over with menus fairly fast. The menus were a little dirty, which always turns me off a bit in restaurants. We asked our server about the size of the poutines. We wanted to have some cocktails and poutine as our meal. We were thinking of ordering two or three of the smaller poutines. He initially said we should order two poutines and a burger, but having had burgers for lunch, we opted to do the three small poutines. WAY TOO MUCH POUTINE! We had it for dinner, then breakfast the next day, then dinner again. This is what we had:

Vladimir Poutine- Smoked Meat, Beet Confit, Crispy Onion and Russian Dressing. This was my favorite because the beet confit really made the dish. There was a good ratio of fries to cheese to gravy but I literally had ONE piece of smoked meat. Not good. I honestly did not even see any crispy onion, but maybe it blended well with the fries. Minimal dressing. Overall, this was really tasty, but if you're going to put meat in it, there should be more than a couple pieces!

Napoleon Poutine- Poutine with Foie Gras- Unlike the Vladimir Poutine which was missing the meat, there was definitely a good amount of fois gras on this, but it was a little too much fattiness- fries, gravy, cheese, foie gras! Amazing for a few bites, but it could be balanced out with a veg like the beets in the Vladimir. 

Fidel Poutine- Lobster bisque, lobster meat, cheese, shrimp and scallops. Sounds amazing right? LITERALLY THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR TINY ASS SCALLOPS. Maybe there were one or two pieces of lobster. I didn't see any shrimp! If you're advertising seafood on the poutine, please, PUT SEAFOOD ON THE POUTINE. 

Now, was the poutine good? Yes. However, I felt a little ripped off on the meat and seafood front, especially considering this poutine is not cheap at $15 plus per poutine. 

We also had the Moscow cocktail- basically a Moscow Mule. There were good and strong but nothing really remarkable. The cucumber is a nice touch though. 

The service was super relaxed and we were definitely not rushed. However, our server went MIA as we were finishing our meal and we were forced to relocate from our table to the bar because da Club was getting ready to open at 11 and we were sitting right in the middle of the entrance. Okay, so we move and we go sit at the bar and have some beer but no server.... then, what seemed like an hour later, our server materializes and seems confused as to whether we paid our bill (we hadn't). So being, good ethical people, we tell him we had not paid and offer up our cards. At this point, I kind of would have rather been out of this place exploring the rest of MTL rather than waiting around for the server. 

Another negative point, the bathrooms, located downstairs in da Club were filthy with clogged up toilets and dirty floors. Nevertheless, there was a random gaggle of girls eating a full sized pizza over one of the sinks... um, okay. 

My recommendation if you come here would be to just go for the fun name and atmosphere- have a beer and a Vladimir Poutine. Do not sit outside or near da Club. Go inside by the window. Don't expect great service or a lot of protein on your poutine."}
{"text":"Yum and fun. The staff was friendly and nice. I loved the Poutine (I tried the Vladimir) and my husband had the salmon; also perfect. The space is really cool. There were families, friends and myself with my husband so there is something for everyone. I can't wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. A bit over priced, and service was slow - but it was prime dining time on F1 weekend. So we didn't expect it to be fast. Fun menu!!"}
{"text":"We came for their poutine, and weren't impressed! They are also a bit pricey, and ingredients weren't fresh. We ordered unconventional poutines; the Napoleon that comes with foie gras and the Fidel with lobster meat, shrimps and scallops. However waiters were polite and helpful, and we enjoyed the nice terrasse."}
{"text":"Ok so yes, I was here for an elite event...BUT i bought (For my bf since he doesn't like social gatherings) one of their Musolini Poutines (a small) to go. So this review is 100 % based off that experience and the small musolini poutine, not the elite event. 

So maybe they already liked us cuz we're elites... But they were still happy to serve me at the end of our event and i paid and tipped separately for this. Annie, the boss, had recommended I order the sauce on the side, so it doesn't soggy up the fries until I get home to re-heat it. The waiter had no problem with this request either. Too sweet and such a good idea that turned out perfect! 

The Musolini poutine (with Italian sausage) was verrrrrrry good even re-heated @ home. My bf did say he wished he tried it fresh cuz it does lose some of it's oomph in the transporting n re-heating, but that's not the restos fault. The small was more than enough for a meal, was literally covered in such amazing cheese curds, Italian sausage was delicious (it woulda been even better with spicy sausage but i won't dock points for that), and had a very generous portion of delicious homemade gravy! (yes i was licking the container, yes my bf told me to stop that, no i didn't listen). 

Anywoot isolate the poutine i took to go and i am still new fan-o numero uno of this new place: it rawks! I am still drooling about going back and having everything else on the menu toooooooooo! 

I will be looking for excuses to come back: any takers?!?!?!?!"}
{"text":"Where to begin?  First, the name is irresistible.  Naming the various dishes after dictators and politicians is amusing, with a smattering of Soviet propaganda posters augmenting the decor.  It's an interesting, stylish and well done renovation - the restaurant is within a nightclub complex in a heritage building.  They manage to have fun with the novelty of the restaurant without beating the concept to death. Staff are friendly and for the most part professional, though clearly everyone is still finding their feet as they'd only been open about a month.  

The menu offers about ten different poutines - enough to be interesting but not so many as to be overwhelming for choice.  Really interesting combinations - very appealing. There are also burgers, sandwiches and desserts.  Portions are good - the small-sized poutine was plenty for one person.  Everything looks great and is nicely presented.  Also a full bar, with some really great cocktails.  Prices seemed quite reasonable given the room and the location.  

We each ordered different poutines and shared so we could try as many as possible.  Everything was good, though the different poutines were pretty similar in taste, which was a little disappointing considering how tempting and 'gourmet' everything seemed when reading the menu.  Possibly this can be viewed as a positive: you don't really need to agonize over your choice of poutine, because they all taste much the same. 

Overall it was a positive experience, and ultimately this is a restaurant about the concept and the room more than it is a restaurant about the food they serve.  Taking that into account the quality of the ingredients and the preparation were pretty good, and the banana split dessert was great.  I'll come back to try the Trump burger next time!"}
{"text":"Overall I'd describe the experience of eating at Vladimir Poutine as \"relatively good\". Most of the food was pretty tasty although, oddly enough, the Poutine seemed like their weakest dish. The dishes were named after world leaders- made ordering extra fun! The wine was delicious as well. My least favorite part of the experience was the decor/ ambience. It was tacky, but not quite tacky enough to be funny, just tacky enough to make it not match the high prices. Not the best place in Montreal by far, but not the worst choice either."}
{"text":"Cool place, poutine was good, drinks were awesomeness!! I had the Molotov cocktail which was so good. My husband had the Place Rouge drink which was also very good. The staff was very welcoming. The place is new so there was only one other customer there. I hope it catches on as it is a fun concept."}
{"text":"Very imaginative drinks and food menu! The Barack salad was great! The Molotov cocktail was also very nice. Ambience is very casual and nice!"}
{"text":"The place was okay. We certainly enjoyed the outside seating and the music was very much to our taste. The menu was quite entertaining, however, the food quality was below expectations. I ordered grilled salmon and it came undercooked. My husband got Vladimir Poutine and it was rather average. Overall, I wouldn't mind going there again for a drink and a snack, but it isn't really a place where the food is something you'd really crave to eat again."}
{"text":"When I found out there was a place called Vladimir Poutine, my dreams came true. The menu is very comical with the dishes named after dictators and leaders. The food was quite good! Very charismatic staff.

One thing that was a bummer was that it was very hard to order vegetarian there, let alone vegan. Almost all of the poutines have tons of meat on them. It could be nice if they offered more veggie friendly options!"}
