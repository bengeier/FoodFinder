{"text":"This place have the best shawarma and gyro in  Arizona. I've been to many Middle eastern and greek restaurants but this one is one if the best so far. This place is highly recommend no this place is a must to go!"}
{"text":"I am from out of town. Missed the place the first as it was dark ss it is small strip cemtrr eith othrr food shops. Service was prompt and staff  very friendly. I had the mixed plate of schwarma, chicken and beef strips. All well seasoned and very tasty. The 3 sauces are great, garlic, tahini and tzatziki. Took half of it home. Also bought 4 diffetent baklavas. Very good meal for under $20, including 4 deserts."}
{"text":"I order their shawarma sandwiches- the meat is great, and they have a nice variety of toppings. It's really good bang for the buck.  Couple of tips: Service is slow so you want to pick a time when there's no line.  Their shawarmas come in tortillas so I ask for the tortilla to be heated on the griddle otherwise it gets soggy and breaks"}
{"text":"Man if I could give the place more stars I would. Awesome customer service to start with. Great food and the drinks they had were so good. Firat time there but will definitely go back. One of my new faves!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best shawarma place in town. Their chicken Sharma is the best I had in Arizona out of all the ones I've had here in the past 3 years. They also have an owners menu with amazing new rules of Sharma that I love. Drinks wise, i love their heart attack smoothie with is better than most of the smoothie places combined. Amazing food and one I go to regularly"}
{"text":"The portion is really heafty. I've only had the chicken shawarma plate and it does not dissapoint. Their choice of items in the salad are plenty and their chicken is really tasty. The staff is pretty friendly too."}
{"text":"Low key spot on Lemon Street in Tempe. Best veggie burger in the state, honestly. No Morningstar patties over here. No frozen veggie patties from the grocery store. If you are a vegetarian definitely give this one a chance. Reminds me of a fried green tomato sandwich. Bun is crisp and buttery on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. Lots of fresh veggies, pickles, and olives. Oh and it's like 3.99! Add a Vimto and you are set. Open late, and a casual vibe. Right next to a hookah lounge too. The ladies that work here are super polite, and very welcoming. Definitely our new Sunday burger spot. The wife and I love this place."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in town hands down . Took me back to Dubai oh man love it you have to try it trust me!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant's namesake, cones of roasting chicken and gyro meat, find their way into several dishes. The combo plate is a good way to sample both, and it is served with rice, hummus, pita bread and salad. Both the chicken shawarma and gyro were moist and flavorful, avoiding the pitfalls that sometimes accompany a method of cooking that can render meat dry or rubbery. The garlic \"sauce\" that tops the chicken, is more of a garlic mayonnaise, and it's amazing.       The BOSS shawarma is something special. Every single bite is as good as the next one. You just have to try it. No words for it. Nice n cozy sitting area inside and outside. Sitting outside at a sidewalk table, I like to nibble on the heaping plate of delicately seasoned fries.   ??For dessert, Shawarma Paradise's baklava is a traditional take on the Middle Eastern confection. Shawarma Paradise might be simple and unassuming, but the straightforward formula here hits the spot."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's located in a tucked away corner in ASU territory and can be easy to miss. Really modest and relaxed ambience. The owner is extremely kind. Definitely one of the better shawarma joints in Tempe (it's always the smaller, lesser known places that have quality food) Don't miss out on this hidden gem."}
{"text":"I've tried a few of the shawarma around Tempe and this takes the cake for late night shawarma shops. For the price you get a heaping portion along with hummus which you would pay extra for at other restaurants. The shawarma doesn't have the bland flavoring that other restaurants do. The rice is also better than the other shops that I've visited. It's a must try if you are looking for late night food."}
{"text":"This is easily the BEST veggie burger I've ever had. I feel like Marshall from how I met your mother on \"the best burger in New York\" episode. I feel like I just found the fountain of youth. You know how hard it is to come across a veggie burger that isn't used with the same patty that EVERY restaurant/food chain uses?! 1 in a million damn near. Oh and the service is great. Seems like all their food is amazing besides they cook it all fresh. I'll definitely be coming here every day"}
{"text":"I go here very often and I always get the veggie burger. Top it with a little garlic sauce and it turns out to be so good. The patties are deep fried, and come out hot and fresh.   Choosing the sauces and toppings can get a bit confusing since they haven't labeled all the sauces that they have available especially if someone is just looking to try some middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Called in take-out for a chicken shawarma plate, they said about 15 minutes, I got there in 30. When I arrived there was about 8 people that had gotten there right before me. I tried to stand in front of the register but no one that worked there acknowledged me to help me pay, even after they finished starting everyone order who just walked in and I told them I was there for pickup. They proceeded to ring-up about 10 people before my one take-out order was even asked about. I honestly was just going to leave since at this point its about 50 minutes since the food was made. Unfortunately many places are closed at 10:30pm or else I would have left without a 2nd thought. There's no point in doing takeout if you make your customers wait as long as the person just walking inside. All that would have saved this review is a minuscule amount of acknowledgement, since the food is decent."}
{"text":"I was in the keys last week and found a little place there that had the best falafels I ever had. So I had a taste for them her other night when we found this place. I was hoping for paradise close to home but they couldn't live up. I rested the falafel sandwich and the guy started to make it with a tortilla so I stopped him. Then he started spreading mayo and I stopped him in favor of humans. Maybe it was my mistake because it was terrible. It tasted bland. No cool Arabic salad and cucumber sauce. They did have a great house Spivey sauce but it couldn't save this sandwich. And to top things off I had to run home to the bathroom when I was done. It's a shame because they are open late night. Probably the only time you could enjoy this place is late night when your drunk. Big fail."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Great service and very kind people that make you feel welcome. Likely the least expensive yet the tastiest shawarmas in town.  The burgers are also amazing, likely because it's made so fresh.    They're also open late, so great place for late takeout."}
{"text":"Great gyros but the employees don't really know what theyre doing. Slow and unsure of their product and the register system."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place to eat because it's late or you need a bite to soak up the alcohol,  go somewhere else.  I ended up with food poisoning after eating a chicken sharwma sandwich here.  Needless to say,  I won't go back or recommend them."}
{"text":"Zero stars or even negative i would give this place. The food or rather parts of it, is meh at best. I would say the best part of it is the mushroom and olives. The chicken or other meat is really weirdly cooked, i am no chef but i think when you put so much salt in the meat it is definitely to hide some bad cooking stuff.  Anyways even all this was okay, but i got the falafel sandwich , and it waa RAWWW inside!! Like absolutely raw, and the guy who made this needs an attitude check- you know who i am talking about - dude, dont judge the people who are ordering your food. And making/serving food is gods work, if you hate it so much dont do it!! He has this demeaning  attitude towards people in general ordering food. Wth??!! So i went back again and the other guy was nicer and felt bad for the uncooked falafel and made me another one, which again seemed a bit uncooked, and then i realized the insides are like doughy still. Even though he flattened it out and cooked it for longer. And it strikes me, it is prolly because they make the ball too hard and big and freeze it, that the oil not only has to fry it, but also defrost it , and it does not do it. At all! Anyways they really do not know how to cook, and the falafel tasted soooo bland  even if Iam wrong and it was cooked!! It was like eating shoes! ( and i have been eating falafels for last 25 yrs, in India we have an equivalent fried patty made out of chickpeas)  This place is proof any meat on a stove will sell near ASU, because the drunk mouth does not care about taste. Most of their clientele is the asu partying kids! And that's saying something.  So yeah there you have it, dont get fooled by the 4 stars , the food and service here is truly one of the worst, and go there only when your tongue is dead from alcohol.  I just came back from portland and truly killed my mouth from this place after tasting heavenly food in portland. Yikes!  Sorry for the long review, and have a nice day!"}
{"text":"The food was really good especially for the price! The establishment is clean and the servers are friendly."}
{"text":"Love the concept, the food and the staff here are friendly! I would definitely recommend! And try their Choco Shawarma Paradise for desserts!"}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma was stuffed with fries and wrapped in a flour tortilla instead of a pita or naan bread. I'm so confused by this meal that I can't tell if it's normally made this way, or the cook got lazy with my pick-up order."}
{"text":"great little mediterranean spot for a quick gyro shawarma ! love that they are open late catering to my late night cravings. priced very well too - about $5 for one shawarma. definitely would recommend and come back !"}
{"text":"The guys working here had a very disrespectful attitude....you know.....the kind you encounter from certain men that don't respect women. Unfortunate to have young, immature kids ruining a spot like this with their disrespectful customer service."}
{"text":"So new that there's some issues to work out.  Only 1 guy doing everything, cooking, taking orders, payment. That makes for slow service. They can't make every dish because they're always running out of something. No brewed iced tea or fountain drinks.    Food tastes fine. Generous portions. I'll give this place another try in a few months when they straighten some things out."}
{"text":"Addictingly good food! You have the option to build your own sandwich, with chicken or beef shawarma, or gyro meat or falafel. Similarly to Chipotle or Subway, the staff will ask you what kind of bread you want, (tortilla or Arabic bread), and go down the line of different toppings that you can add to your sandwich.   There is also a combo option of fries and a drink to go with the sandwich, but I usually ask for the fries inside the sandwich. :) The amount of food you get is worth every penny you spend on a sandwich! My only gripe is that service can be slow."}
{"text":"Exceptional service and food. This restaurant offers authentic shawarma and gyro. Don't miss out on this gem!"}
