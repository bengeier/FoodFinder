{"text":"This is a great experience.  I have dined there four times now with various family members.  Everyone very much enjoyed the food and the atmosphere.   IT is where the Glass Tower used to be right in the heart of Moon Township next to Clearview Credit Union.  

Be aware that this restaurant has changed hands four times in the last couple of years. The new owner is a very nice man and  the food is way above any of the other permutations.

Price is quite moderate.  Entries run from $9 to $14.  Per person you should not spend more than $20.  The servings are quite adequate and you should have some leftovers for lunch the next day.  I believe they have coupons in the local papers and are now in the entertainment book for a bogo entree.   IT is BYO so you have additional savings.  The bottle shop is just down the street above the Trivia Pub so you can buy yourself a nice beer to go along with your meal. 

Excellent Northern and Southern Indian cuisine.    The sauces are savory and filled with complex flavors.  Everything is fresh  The breads are fresh and awesome and the rice is the BEST I have ever had in a  restaurant.

The atmosphere is typical of Indian restaurants in the area.  With the Bollywood them in full motion you can watch Indian videos as you enjoy your meal.   

I have dined at every Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh and I am very excited to have such a culinary find so close to my house."}
{"text":"The good:
I have tried the Chicken Tikka Masala with Naan and Basmati Rice. Also, tried somosas. It was very good. 

Very Spacious, good for conversations and privacy. Nice and tasteful Interiors. Looks new and very clean.

Apart from food, I like the songs bollywood songs playing in the background which I dont get to listen a lot these days.

The owner is a very hospitable person, hence this review :)

The bad:
If you go alone, it can be a little expensive. All the times I have been there, there isn't much crowd and so for people who enjoy, people watching, not the best option, but if you like quiet and private kind of evening, its great.

Buffet can be little better. Would have liked more TVs. 

Overall, its worth a try and a great option"}
{"text":"Very attentive service.  Food is always fresh and tasty.  I'm not a big fan of Indian food and I'd go back to Bollywood Cafe anytime.  The food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Traveling in from LA and need a quick bit of some vegan friendly food; Yelp'd for Indian food near the airport and Bollywood cafe was on my radar. Let me say, I was very surprised at what a terrific meal we had; best naan bread to date. Everything was very fresh. I highly recommend the Bollywood cafe to vegans and non-vegans alike!"}
{"text":"This location has once again changed names: Rangoli Cafe. Check out their new website http://www.rangolicafe.com"}
{"text":"Awesome food...
The raita and chutney, even though small are made very tastefully."}
{"text":"Fresh, Fast, Reasonable and VERY tasty!

I'm spoiled by a variety of excellent Indian options in SoCal...I was quite excited to find such a great Indian food restaurant so close to my hotel!

Seems to have a loyal local following and lots of take out orders when I was there so don't be put off if you walk into this large restaurant and find it empty."}
{"text":"We had the kebob sampler which included a tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala and ground lamb. All was very good. Sauces that accompanied were excellent. Naan bread you had to order separate which I've never seen. Most places it just comes with the meal. Gulab Jamun was some of the best I've had. Entre, bread, gulab  Jamun, and soda was $22. Short walk from the Holiday Inn Airport. 

All in all I would recommend this place for dinner and would return again. We just missed the (3pm) lunch buffet so I can't comment it.

The entrance is on the side near the rear so we drove right by it without noticing. I only new it was located there from yelp."}
