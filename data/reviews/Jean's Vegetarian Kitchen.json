{"text":"I would go back for the \"fish\" - very tasty. 

Clean, nice space. No patio but big front window."}
{"text":"I want to give this place an excellent review... I really, really do.  The food is fantastic, the people are friendly and welcoming and the prices are incredibly reasonable.  If it weren't for the very long wait times for the food, I would gladly rate this spot five stars.  
Unfortunately it's not uncommon for my partner and I to wait almost 40 minutes before we finally get our meals, which is especially strange considering the restaurant is often almost entirely empty.  We once brought an extra person with us and it took almost an hour before we got the three dishes we ordered...with each of them brought out about 20 minutes apart.  
If you do check this place out, call ahead and get takeout.  You get the full experience of the yummy, yummy food, and you know it will be ready for you by the time you pick it up.  The Green Curry is excellent.  (Also, head's up: If you order a dish with the vegan shrimp, you'll only get one, maybe two pieces!  Which is a shame, because they are super yummy.)"}
{"text":"Wow, nice restaurant, nice people good food , and adjusted menu  to suit my need ,even with a full house,  and reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Noodle dishes were great. Also had the faux lemon fish starter. 

I honestly must have walked by the placed a thousand times before I realized they served Thai. I was happy I stopped in, I will defiantly be eating there, or at least ordering for takeout again."}
{"text":"Have been going here for a while now. Went a few weeks ago and the pumpkin soup was... a tad watered down, wasnt as enjoyable as usual. However this place is AMAZING! Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"Jean's is a gem! So nice to have a solid vegetarian option like this along the Danforth. My favorite dish is probably the noodle dish with tomato sauce, though I haven't disliked a single thing I've tried there, and I've tried most of the things on the menu. Portions aren't huge, but I think they're reasonably priced. The staff is always pleasant.

My one gripe is that a few of the fake meats contain animal products, and they're not clearly labeled on the menu. It seems like it would be so simple for them to just switch the meats to vegan versions and make the whole restaurant vegan (like Vegetarian Haven, which offers many of the same types of meats, or Green Earth, which went from vegetarian to vegan in the last few years)."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a Friday night. We were seated immediately. Restaurant was very clean and comfortable.

Jean's is a great choice if you are a vegetarian looking for an interesting selection of asian food. The menu has what seems to me to be an extensive array of Thai and Malaysian options.

We had the Crispy Curry Rolls to start which very excellent - essentially spring rolls with curried corn and other vegetables. Very unique and delicious.

I had the Malaysian Curry Vegetables which was also delicious. The tofu was fried enough to give it a good texture but not overdone. The addition of potatoes in the dish was also very interesting - this might be a traditional Malaysian choice but was something I hadn't seen before.

My companion had the Singapore Noodles which were also great. I'm not a huge fan of \"faux meats\" but the mock chicken was great and the mock shrimp was new to me - even had the right colouring.

For dessert we shared the Black Sticky Rice with Coconut Milk which we thoroughly enjoyed. Great combination of sweet and savoury flavours.

I give Jean's a 4 not because there was anything wrong with it - it's just not a restaurant that will change your life. That said, if you are a vegetarian, or even just an adventurous eater, looking for good, healthy Thai/Malaysian food I don't know why you go anywhere else. Portions were generous and the prices are very reasonable (average $9 per entree). They seem to do a good take out business.

Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Decent service and AMAZING food with generous portions, this is a great spot for a quick bite. Very casual decor and service, a no frills attitude that matches its great prices.

We ordered the taro rolls to start, then the red curry with faux shrimp and the pad thai. Taro rolls were quite well done, very flavourful and cooked perfectly so that the pastry did not fall apart throughout consumption. The red curry was the BEST red curry I have ever tasted. For former shrimp-lovers come veg, you will pleasantly surprised by the closeness of the texture, appearance and even flavour of the \"shrimp.\" The pad thai was absolutely delicious as well, with a very unique flavour profile. Slightly sweeter than expected and could have used a little more heat, but overall, a delicious meal. I had to stifle some \"Mmmmmms\" to avoid annoying my companion."}
{"text":"We were thinking of some quick takeout but as we were waiting for our food we realized that there was such a good vibe in Jean's we decided to stay.   

We ordered the pad Thai, spicy tofu with vegetables, saffron sticky rice and, of course, the delicous pumpkin soup.   I am one of the lucky ones who has yet to have enough of it!   

I'm not a huge fan of the faux meat and it seems as if most of the menu items have one or more types of 'meat' in it.  I would like to see more options without them.      

Our server was gracious and attentive with one of the warmest smiles I've seen.  The food was not only presented nicely it was tasty, satisfying, abundant and very reasonably priced.    I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"The soup is delicious, and the service is great! Jenny was my server, smiling, great conversation and a great memory. I'm tempted to make the trek (from west-end), just for that pumpkin soup."}
{"text":"I love Jean's.  I've stored their number in my phone and often call on the way out of work and pick up dinner right after I get off the subway.  We have also dined at Jeans and find the atmosphere pleasant and the service delightful.  

My favorite dish is the Pad Thai, which to me is a comfort food akin to Mac and Cheese or Pizza.  I will admit that I love faux meat, though I realize it is not for everyone.  His favorite is the Tofu and Eggplant Assam (stirfry in a tamarind sauce).  We also go for the delicious Pumpkin Soup (in the winter) or Mango Salad (in the summer)."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Best Thai food in toronto and it's vegetarian. The pumpkin soup is great. Love the noodles and curries. Portions are a bit small in the protein department, but the quality of the veggie meats are very high. Love all the broccoli in the dishes. Happy to eat here anytime."}
{"text":"This is a superb place to eat if you are looking for Malaysian cuisine, always fresh and so flavourful. Their laksa soup and the asaam tamarind okra just to name a couple of my favourites are always a great choice. Basically you can't err with anything you order on their menu. Great service, very caring polite owners and staff."}
{"text":"Ok, I know it's a bit like swimming against the current, but I'm going to have to disagree with most of the reviews posted here...
This place is just o.k.  That's it.
Colour me ignorant but I just don't get what all the fuss is about. My  gf & I have sat down for dinner a couple of times ( she's of the vegetarian variety ) and found the food nothing to write home about. Yes, it's small, tidy & nicely lit but for our tastes that isn't enuff. 
That, & the small monk of an owner gives me dirty looks."}
{"text":"We have had take out from Jean's twice and both times the food has been exceptional.  Best Thai and Malaysian food we have had in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Jean's Vegetarian Kitchen is such a lovely little place.
The food is so flavourful, the service so charming and the ambience very zen-like.
I recently dined at Jean's for my birthday. A few lady friends had said some great things about the Danforth Avenue resto so I thought I'd give it a try and I wasn't disappointed.
Essentially, it's a vegetarian Malaysian/Thai restaurant.
They have this scrumptious pumpkin soup appetizer. I couldn't resist giving it a try. My dinner date, Dad, enjoyed curry potato-filled spring rolls.
His pad thai was lovely as was the red curry I ordered.
We left feeling full but not stuffed.
I'd def. go back.
All in all, it was a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"I am a life long meat eater, but don't let the 'Vegetarian' in 'Jean's Vegetarian Restaurant' throw you. We've been coming here for years (they've had previous locations) and never been disappointed. The classic Pad Thai is the only one I'll eat in the city; it hasn't been ruined by adding ketchup (a practice many Thai restaurants employ to sweeten it to accommodate our 'western tastes). The Pad Thai is so sweet and good in the hands of chef Jean, you'll be back for more."}
{"text":"When it comes to vegetarian food I always have nightmares of an ex taking me to Le Commensal on Bay Street where they weigh your food to charge you. Never was overly impressed by the place and i'm hesitant on wanting to ever go to any other vegetarian restaurants. This was my second visit to Jean's Vegetarian Restaurant.

An older man offered us Pumpkin soup first off but after sifting through the menu I had unfortunately forgotten about this and ordered the hot and sour soup which was fantastic. Based on previous reviews I regret not trying the pumpkin though

Although the older man took our order, he seemed to be only managing things as a younger lady ran around dropping orders off, cleaning up, and refilling water.

I stayed away from ordering a ginger ale this time around as the old guy brought us Ginger Beer by mistake last time.

I ordered the malaysian currie and a side of rice. Very tasty. Also had Currie rolls which although tasty, didn't really have alot of flavour.

Service was great and the place was absolutely busy. It is a small place and holds probably about 20 people. Restaurant is nice and clean although it is probably in the sketchiest block on the Danforth.

I would definately go back"}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian, but always have a good food and good times at Jean's kitchen. And I imagine vegetarian people like it even more. 

Good times start with the smiles - everyone is pleasant and polite. Next comes with the pumpkin soup, which I almost feel bad to reject (they will come to you and say, we have a pumpkin soup today, and after many visits, you will think, I had it 100's of times already :)

Pad Thai is possibly the best in town (although Pad Thai is far from my favorite dish, it's a must-try in any place) The menu has some very healthy options (a big reason why I like Thai in the first place). 
Avoid the faux meats and shrimp, for me they just spoil the taste, if I feel for meats I go to the different restaurant in the first place. Love their noodles, you can never go wrong with any of the noodle choice here. 

The good times end with a reasonable bill and again with plenty of smiles. Note that they only open at 5PM each day!!!"}
{"text":"Jean's has excellent food, good portions and lots of options. My partner and I have eaten here 5 times so far and have really enjoyed all our meals, the green curry with rice, the sweet & sour tofu and mix veg, and deep fried tofu with peanut sauce are all very tasty. The staff are very friendly and provide quick service. I'm don't usually order mock meat, but the couple times I had it at Jean's it's had a nice texture and flavour. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"We have been trying to go to Jean's kitchen for some time, as on spring we were trying to go on Monday, but they are closed on Monday's until successfully this winter. We had been checking their web page with amazing mouth watering photos for few times and we more or less knew what we would have there. 

We arrived there for a late dinner on Thursday around 8 PM, though they are said to be opened until 10 PM, but they tend to close earlier, so please keep that in mind, when planning on going there for late dinner. The place is tidy and has room for 30 people. Quiet and pleasant atmosphere, but felt a bit too sterile. Knowing what we will be having, we didn't stop too long at looking their wonderful menu, though it had really nice design and clarity to it, which you do not see often. I must say that this is one of the few places which menu I remember and think highly of. Good job, and we even't hadn't ordered our food yet!

So we had Pad See Yew and Shangai Noodles (photos included). I loved my u-don, as it had the texture of meat, for a vegetarian this felt interesting, I mean in a good way. I loved it. So good and filling. Nice flavoring and all. Vermicelli was as good, so we were just happy couple there as the only visitors. The server was very kind and asked to our questions of the various dishes. She filled our water glasses when these were getting emptier. When we paid, we got the candies to make the mouth sweet. We were happy and satisfied as we rolled out from there. Read: we were full! :) as we squeezed in all what was put to our plates.

Next time we will try their pumpkin soup, which seems to be their best-selling and most famous item on the menu and the soupy kind of dish called laksa."}
{"text":"Lived in the Danforth for 4 years, and this place was a frequent stop.

Best to have:
Golden Baskets (appetizer)-- delicious little mouthfuls
The curries: I especially loved the malaysian one with lots of potatoes and tofu in a creamy coconut sauce
House vegetarian delight with the \"chicken\" drumsticks: these chicken drumsticks are seriously the best fake meat EVER.  We always order an extra side order to top up what comes on the dish.
Saffron rice.  It's practically a dessert rice, so rich and delicious.

The owner is a super cute old dude who moves suuuuuuper slowwwwly.

The Danforth is greek-food hell, this place is a welcome respite for vegetarians."}
{"text":"It's a quaint out of the way place providing a relaxing atmosphere to facilitate a quiet place for conversation as well as enjoying the taste and texture of the food.  
The menu is quite diverse in selection. We had mock fish cake with a sweet chili sauce follow by the pumpkin soup. Pumpkin soup has a great texture of nuttiness and creaminess. The braised rice vermicelli was flavorful and fresh. The greens and mushroom stir-fry with mock chicken was very tasty. The Malaysian curry okra with mock shrimp has a mild spiciness that worked well with the coconut rice. The okra was a bit over cooked. Gary likes it the way it is. 
The dessert was sweet potato pudding. This dessert special tasted more like an over baked sweet potato with some sweet white sauce. Not that it tasted bad, just underwhelming. 
Overall, we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Most of the menu items contain \"faux meat\" as well as tofu--I order everything without the meat substitutes, I think many people do as well. The consistency of the  pad thai is perfect, the noodles are just right and the sauce is spicy and flavorful.

The owners are very sweet."}
{"text":"Jean's is definitely one of the nicer vegetarian asian restaurants in the city. Run by a friendly Malaysian (?) family, we visited on a snowy (and relatively busy!) Tuesday evening for a late dinner. 

I am a huge fan of faux meat. I travelled throughout asia, and Loved eating at the Cantonese vegetarian and buddhist restaurants where faux meat is the star. I have yet to find anything like that in Toronto, but I am always on the hunt, for certain. 

My SO and I were both starving, so we ordered a wide variety of dishes. We started with the Deep Fried Tofu Appetizer, ($3.00) which was two tofu \"sandwiches\" served with julienne carrots and cucumbers, bean sprouts and a sweet peanut (and tamarind?) dip.  

We then had a wide noodle thai dish, Pad See Yew ($8.50) with faux shrimp, and chicken. It was really flavourful thanks to some thai basil, and the veggie-chicken was fantastic. Best \"chicken\" I have had in a while. 

We also ordered a red curry and tofu ($8.50) which disappointingly had only two pieces of tofu and was on the mild side. Lots of vegetables, but no comparison to Sukothai. Rice is extra ($1.50)

Lastly we had a GInger, Chili Eggplant ($8.50) which was really good. The eggplant was cooked perfectly, the sauce delicious and not too oily. Well worth it.

The Pad Thai is ENORMOUS. ($8.50) Every other table was ordering it. 

It must be noted that the food came out FAST even though the restaurant was busy. Excellent alternative to fast food.  The service was top-notch, and the friendly patriarch perched at the bar watched over everything. This place has an excellent vibe and we really enjoyed it. 

In the end, I would have loved some more heat, everything was a little bland. It is nice to have a lighter, healthier option than Simon's Wok in the east end, and the service was fantastic.  A little pricey, but worth it for organice and veggie treats. Dinner for two with tea $38.10. 

Will definitely be back for Assam Tamarind Tofu with Eggplant and Curry Drumsticks (how did I miss those the first visit!)"}
{"text":"I always feel so welcomed when I visit this restaurant. I never thought I could enjoy mock duck but I love their mock duck red curry. Everything on the menu is delicious."}
{"text":"Nice place for Asian vegetarian food. Traditional dishes with nice services. The dishes were not big, but enough for one person. We shared 4 dishes with coconut rice. Good taste!"}
{"text":"A nice find on the Danforth. Very large portions, good for multiple meals for me. Run by nice people, good service. More casual place. I am vegetarian and went here with my meat-eating friend, and she liked her meal as well. 

It is worth noting that they do not open until 4:30pm, which I figured out today when I went for lunch."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed. The food is amazing. I had the Malaysian curry with eggplant and mock chicken (the most expensive thing on the menu at $11.50) and it was awesome. The food is the right price, the service is friendly, and it the popularity of the place was obvious because of the steady stream of customers.
Vegetarian delight indeed!"}
{"text":"Should be labeled an Asian (at least mostly Thai) vegetarian restaurant.  Generally great food.  Gai tom Kha OK, not as flavorful as others I've had.  Many dish come with fake non-vegetarian items.  We had the chicken - which resembled dark-meat chicken pieces.   Mango salad was excellent.  Green curry with chicken was pretty good.  Coconut rice was sweet/interesting - seemed as though cooked in coconut milk- not with coconut pieces.  Curry crispy rolls were pretty good.  Ambience small nice, casual."}
{"text":"Like some other vegetarian reviewers here, I had high hopes, and was a little disappointed.  The food was good, but not great, and with so many better options in Toronto, I won't likely return. 

And then there's this:

*CELIAC ALERT*

Most disconcerting is the fact that the staff believe that their entire menu is gluten free. Shockingly (because they work in the food industry), they think that 'gluten' only refers to Asian mock meat gluten, and have no clue that gluten is in wheat. They actually have wheat noodles on the menu, and many of their dishes contain soy sauce made from fermented soy and wheat. Also, as I'm familiar with the products they use (like the soy drumsticks), I'm fairly certain that all of their soy based mock meat has gluten in it, too. 

The staff at Jean's seem very sweet, but I'm sure they have inadvertently made a lot of very trusting people very sick. 

Disappointing, since I really like to support all-veg places. 

*sad face*"}
{"text":"I'll add my name to the list of satisfied customers.

If the pumpkin soup is available, try it!  It's not huge, but big enough to share if you're trying to save room for the rest of the meal.

The meat analogues were interesting, but unnecessary.  I'd stick with the vegetable/tofu versions next time.

The staff is very friendly, and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing vegetarian restaurant. For someone who is new to vegetarian eating, this is the best place to start of your veggie diet. Their curries are the best, also their fake monk fish and shrimps."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the distinction of being perhaps the only Thai/Malaysian vegetarian restaurant in town, and is located just steps from the Greenwood TTC station, next door to a vegetarian Ethiopian restaurant (haven't tried that one yet). 

My first visit to the restaurant was favourable and not too pricey (dinner for 2 was around $40). The service was friendly, and while the first two dishes were so-so (the cold rolls were merely average and the curry was a bit too liquidy for my taste, the Mee Goreng (fat noodles) dish was simply amazing - flavourful and with lots of textures. I really enjoyed the meal as a whole, and I look forward to sampling different dishes on my next visit. All in all, a very welcome addition to the vegetarian restaurant scene in Toronto."}
{"text":"My wife and i went the jean's on a date night last week. The food was amazing!! The pumpkin soup is a must try if you are ever there, a wonderful blend of sweet and savoury. I had the Pad Thai and my wife had the Garlic Mustard Greens and both were splendid. After dinner we had the mango stick rice for dessert and it was so good!

I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great, unique food. Super friendly staff. Music was not to my taste, but hey, I think it was at least native to Malaysia."}
{"text":"Bonus points for the east end for this little gem of a restaurant! It's been 2 1/2 months since I converted to eastendism and this restaurant made me proud of my moving decision.
The aesthetics of the restaurant isn't high-end but it's very clean and comfortable. The stereo was kickin' some AC music but not loud enough to grate on the nerves.
The owner is this elderly gentleman who looks like he could've been a former buddhist monk. He shuffled slowly up to our table and gave us some pearls of wisdom about how awesome the pumpkin soup is. I want to try it next time based on some of the above reviews but I was more in the mood for appetizers. 
I tried the cold rolls and they were light, crispy on the inside and the tofu was flavourful! I ordered the Pad kee mau (??). I asked the owner what he recommended from the noodle selection other than pad thai. My dish was plentiful and so delicious! The rice noodles were perfect! They didn't sit on my plate in a gelatinous clump like I've experienced with other pad thai's. The spice was enough for a bit of ring of fire (tmi?). It had one piece of fake shrimp which was new to me. A bit weird. The fake meat wasn't overpowering and the flavour of the dish was packed with garlic, basil and yumminess.
i had a taste of the red curry and that was pretty awesome too. Brown rice comes at a separate price. other than that, I thought everything was priced fairly.
This place made me swoon!"}
{"text":"My review is based on my recent visit to Jean's, I am disappointed to give it a negative rating.

Tried the Braised Rice Noodle, which was a stir-fry of various vegetables with faux chicken with some sauce over noodles.  The entire dish tasted of stale/overused cooking oil , something I have never experienced at any chinese /southeast asian restaurant.  Any special ingredients in the dish (i.e. black mushroom, imitation chicken) were scant.  Pad Thai tasted fine but is a pretty standard dish.  Desserts were overly sweetened.  Mango in mango sticky rice was not fresh and was bruised/black on the inside.  Sticky rice and tapioca pudding were far too sweet.

Wasn't too impressed with the food and likely won't go back.  sorry."}
{"text":"Delish. Absolutely delish. The service was friendly, restaurant clean, and the food prompt. Salad Rolls with cucumber and coriander were a great starter. Fresh and complex. Secondly, I did not miss the meat in the Pad Thai with mock chicken at all. In fact, IMO this is one of the better Pad Thais in the city. We will definitely be coming back to Jean's for more. Also, for the record, I am not a vegetarian, just a lover of good food."}
{"text":"Extremely happy with my visit to Jean's and beyond impressed! I gave this restaurant a try based on the wonderful Yelp reviews and I will definitely be back!

Cute and cozy decor, very friendly staff, good service and incredible food! The menu is fully vegetarian with various soy mock meat items and has quite a bit of variety to it. I shared the crispy curry rolls and had a pumpkin soup. Both were extremely delicious, but the soup really made it for me. I shared the sweet potato pudding with coconut cream for dessert which was out of this world! The prices were less than I expected for the great, healthy food and large portion size. My bill came to $29 for an appetizer, two mains and a dessert. 

I'm so glad I discovered Jean's. I will definitely be back and highly recommend this vegetarian restaurant!"}
{"text":"An Allison Krauss song comes to mind, with the phrase \"you've got a new...favourite...\" Malaysian mild but rich sauce over snapping-fresh veggies and coconut rice and a big bowl of tiny clear tapioca pearls with a thick coconut milk sauce for dessert. 

Well priced, tons of fake meat menu items I want to try, bland decor, good service. And the food!

At one point a fellow customer called out for chopsticks for his table, in a loud and grandiose way. The young man who was serving them graciously obliged and apologized, but I wondered - are chopsticks traditional for Thai & Malaysian food? Or did his effort at sophistication just make him look silly?"}
{"text":"It used to be one of the best vegetarian around. Somehow without notice it seems that staff changed and now it is just blend or worth any Chinese mall food."}
{"text":"We've been going to Jean's for years now and it's always good.  Our favourites (in addition to the pad thai of course) are the gado gado, the kao pad, and the Thai basil eggplant (best ever).  Jean and Harry (and their staff) are wonderfully kind and welcoming.  I used to love their homemade soy milk, too.  Not sure if they still serve it."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Friendly folk.  Great service.  I'm holding out one star b/c I think they could do more with vegetables and maybe offer less of the faux meats.  Overall, a great place."}
{"text":"Yummy vegetarian food and great service. Who can ask for more? I was expecting a pleasant time and this restaurant beat those expectations by a long shot. The sour soups are amazing. They should bottle the base, I'd drink it! :)"}
{"text":"Visit this place often, haven't been in a while but I'd call to make sure its actually closed. I'm surprised. 


Very very good food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurants, vegetarian or not.  I like almost all the food I've had, including the fried bananas, honey lemonade, pad thai, pad see yew, green curry, mango salad."}
{"text":"Delicious! So wonderfully flavoured. The atmosphere is very casual, the prices are fantastic and the service was warm, friendly and speedy. The vegetables were all perfectly cooked. Can't wait to return over and over again."}
{"text":"Food is unbelievably fresh, and the pumpkin soup is to -die- for. It's usually sold out by 7 PM so get there early.

One caveat; I'm not a huge fan of the \"meat substitutes\", although they are made by chef Jean and are totally healthy. I just think the meals taste better without them, but then again I'm a vegetarian and I was never big on meat in the first place.

The malaysian curry and the pad thai are my favourites - one thing, however. This restaurant is much better dine-in than take-out. Take-out is still great (and I admit to doing it regularly), but the flavour is just soo much better when it's hot and steaming at your table.

Great food and great people; a must-try for vegetarians and omnivores alike."}
{"text":"Toronto has a lot of great veg places, but I wouldn't put Jean's at the top of my list. (Strangely, Jean's *is* at the top of yelp's list, at the time I'm writing this review..?) The food is fine, but just not inspired. A lot of dishes based on meat substitues."}
{"text":"I am lucky to be a short walk from this place; I think it might just be my favourite spot on the Danforth.

When I was dating a vegetarian, we went here all of the time and both really loved it.  Service was great, prices are super reasonable and the food is always fresh and delicious.  

And yes, that pumpkin soup really is to die for.  

Most highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went to Jean's last week with a friend. Both of us being nutritionists, we thought to try out a local vegetarian place. Jean's came highly recommended by others, and let me just say- it did not disappoint! 

My friend had a soup special and I had the Malaysian Curry Eggplant. It was absolutely delicious! This is a great find for all vegetarians and lovers of thai/malay food. Very few places in Toronto serve Malay, so I am excited to find one that does, and does it right!"}
{"text":"The Danforth is typically know for Greek Food. This unexpectedly upscale ,sleek Buddha on the bar vegetarian restaurant is a far cry from the souvlaki's on the street. It also comes equipped with everything available in vegan versions. I have never seen that before! 

I started with the wrapped rice-paper rolls deep-fried in canola oil, packed with noodles, and raw carrots which made it perfectly crunchy!The main I went for the Pad Kee Mau, a similar take on pad thai with cauliflower and broccoli, shrimp and basil. This was a meal that filled me up! 

The best part - It was under $8!! 

The service was great , prompt food delivery and always a smile on the servers face- I think it was Jean herself?! I will definitely have to go back and try out the dinner selection!"}
{"text":"Yeah, I'm on a 5 star kick lately. But this is taking into account the strict no meat regimen they have to work with. I am not a vegetarian but I have a real fondness for faux meats. 

This is for the amazing curries. They can't be beat. Seriously, give the red and green curry a try with some steamed coconut rice. I'd score the noodles high too but they don't compare to the awesomeness of the curries."}
{"text":"Wow!! delicious food, huge servings and excellent service. The people are so helpful and they treat you so well. I couldn't ask for more. Friendly atmosphere excellent food huge servings. Try Jeans if you want great food !!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Jean's or taken out from Jeans many times. The food is consistently tasty. There are a few items I'm not crazy about, but the ones we like are reliably delicious each and every time. The service is very nice, and it's such a pleasure to be able to choose anything on the menu (not always doable when you are a vegetarian)."}
{"text":"We had a great meal at Jean's. The prices are really reasonable and the restaurant is nice and clean.   The food taste lighter in flavor in comparison to other thai places in Toronto and doesn't feel greasy.  

We had Taro Rolls and Fried Tofu appetizer to start.  They were both good but I really enjoyed the fried tofu as they were like little tofu sandwiches.  For our mains, we ordered a pad thai with faux chicken and faux shrimp, red curry with veggies and a side of saffron rice.  The pad thai was really good and even though it wasn't too saucy, it was still very tasty.  The curry was a bit spicy for me but not for my bf.  They don't have a liquor license so don't expect to get boozed up!"}
{"text":"Jean's is fantastic. Love the pumpkin soup, pad Thai, tofu with eggplant, the curries. Everything is delicious. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"So sometimes we 'go vegetarian' with my girlfriend, whether for a few weeks or a month.  In those periods we seek out good veggie restaurants to eat at.  This one came at such a time, and although not bad, it wasn't anything marvelous. 

The main 'thing' here is that they serve 'imitation meat'.  Basically processed tofu which tastes (vaguely) like chicken, beef, shrimp etc.  The problem is that the rest of the dishes (minus imitation meat) are very simplistic and cooked very hurriedly.  One could have better cooked vegetarian dishes at Indian and Thai restaurants.  

I had the Buddha Delight with 'chicken' and although the 'chicken' had a vague chicken taste, it was anything but.  The rest of the dish was just a bunch of boiled vegetables; no noodles, variety of mushrooms and other extras that I've had in similarly named dishes in other places.  

The squash soup was very good, I have to say. 

Thus, unless you are a self-hating vegetarian who sorely misses the 'taste' of meat (even in a vague form) - you could have much better vegetarian dishes (minus fake meat) at other places. 

Not bad food, just not that great either."}
{"text":"The food was really good. The pad Thai was tasty and I really enjoyed my pad see sew. I really liked the taro spring rolls. Usually I find rice noodle dishes are really oily but that's not the case at jeans vegetarian kitchen."}
{"text":"I was ultra-excited to sample the vegetarian delights said to be found at Jean's Vegetarian Kitchen.  Everyone who found out I was vegetarian said \"you MUST go there - it's amazing.\"

So, I was all psyched up and excited for some delicious vegetarian grub.  And you know what?

\"Meh, I've experienced better.\"

In fact, MEH, really sums it up.  It was just meh.  Nothing was memorable.  Nothing was good enough to make me come back again (which really disappoints me).  I feel bad because I like that it's run by a cute little old married couple, and there are plenty of fans of this place - but alas - I am not one of them.

Yeah..... Meh.  Meh indeed."}
{"text":"I had the pumpkin soup and Red Curry w rice.  Both were excellent.  I ordered take out.  The service is very friendly.  The restaurant ambiance is drab and uninspiring, more or less just a place to sit."}
{"text":"The food is just as fabulous as when we first started eating here a couple of years ago. Vegans beware though: the mock meat and mock seafood contain whey and are not vegan."}
{"text":"4.5/5

Thai and vegetarian all at one stop? I'm in heaven. 

To be honest, the food here deserves a rating of 5 stars but I'm also taking the location and ambiance into account. What I ordered:

Jean's Pumpkin Soup 4.00
Honey Lemonade 2.50
Organic Soy Milk 2.50
2 Steamed Rice 3.00
Pad See Yew 9.00
Green Curry with Mock Duck 9.50
Spicy Sambal Eggplant with Mock King Fish 11.50

The green curry with mock duck, pumpkin soup, spicy sambal eggplants with mock king fish (you can also choose okra and any other mock options) and honey lemonade were all divine! 

My date never eats eggplants but to please me, he did this time, and to my surprise, he kept raving about the eggplants. He loved the mock king fish too. I must say the green curry here has to be one of the best curries I've tried and goes quite well on steamed rice. Thanks to all the previous reviews, I had to try the pumpkin soup, and oh my, it was delicious. There was a nice subtle hint of curry and the texture of the soup was very rich and smooth. You'll have to try the soup. Just a note, their organic soy milk is homemade, which is nice.

I'll definitely try their Malaysian Curry, Pad Thai, Coconut Rice, Mango Sticky Rice and their Assam (Tamarind) Okra (waitress recommended this) on my next visit. This isn't just good vegetarian food, it's simply delicious food.

{"text":"Finally tried Jean's Vegetarian Kitchen having heard rave reviews for years. Service was quick, food was great, prices were fair. 

I tried the mock chicken and thought it was relatively convincing although my non-vegetarian friends weren't really keen to try the mock meats and just ordered meals with tofu. I guess the variety of mock meats offered here aren't as thrilling to people who are happy to eat the real thing."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, clean, friendly, no meat Thai restaurant on The Danforth.

I found this gem in my neighbourhood through yelp, and I am definitely happy that it's in the neighbourhood. If you are looking for Thai food (and don't mind the mock meats) than this is the place for you.

I'm not particular fond of mock meats. Not because I need meat in my food, but I prefer tofu and beans over mock meats. With that said the food was quite good. I sampled from some other dishes and I'd have to say the radnah was my favourite. I had the laksa and while good, it needed to be more spicy. The coconut sticky rice was excellent and came with a good portion of mango. 

All and all the meals were sizeable for the price. Also you can totally order family style and share dishes. I think I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were craving Thai/Asian food, and decided to give a local place a chance. We chose this place based on Yelp reviews and did a takeout order. I can't give this place a review of more than one star, because we ordered a number of items and threw them ALL away after eating less than half of each dish. It just wasn't good, and the nice service couldn't make up for that. It was also quite an expensive bill, so the value wasn't there either.

There were more than enough items in our order that we figured something had to be good. We ordered Pad Thai, Vegetarian Laksa, Green Curry and Vegetable Balls. The main dishes were flavourless and watery, accompanied by vegetables that were overcooked. I tried to like the Laksa, and while continuing to eat it, my husband just exclaimed \"Why are you still eating that? It's not good!\". It was extremely bland and watery. I was also unimpressed with the \"mock shrimp\" that came with the laksa - I don't like mystery meats, and the \"mock\" items were certainly a mystery. 

Would not recommend. Still looking for great places on the Danforth...we will keep trying, but I'm starting to think they don't exist. :("}
{"text":"LAKSA! LAKSA! LAKSA!

I can not seem to find a reason to dislike this place. The food is always delicious, the service is always spot and and the menu offers good value. In the winter, don't sit too close to the door though, because it can be very chilly when the door gets opened.

My partner and I have eaten here ~15 times and have never had a negative experience of any type and would likely eat here more often if it were closer to us."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with my mother last night aftering doing a Yelp search for close by vegetarian restaurants. Let me tell you, Yelp did not let down. 

The food was BRILLIANT!! Pumpkin Soup was delicious, Golden Basket App was addictively and deceivingly good (their appearance suggested cold vegetable flavor-- NA UH. Greasy, crunchy YUM), the Green Veggie Curry with Coconut Rice. Oh mi lord. I work at a thai restaurant, so I know my green curries-- But this one, was over the wall fantastic (if you can handle a little spice). 

The only thing we ordered that I didn't like was the Deep Fried Tofu with Peanut Sauce. It had a very watery taste that left me wanting flavor. My mother loved it on the otherhand, as she appears to be  a peanut sauce fiend. 

We had the most adorable little server. She seemed rather young (maybe high school) but you just wanted to squeeze her checks she was so smiley and happy to be serving you. 

The reasons why this is not a five star rating:

The lighting here was less then desirable.
They don't serve alcohol (which my mother was desperately in need of after a painful week of a new boss)
And the location is a little bit frightening. It's on that strip of the Danforth that seems to be home to sketchy male characters that don't seem to understand it's impolite to stare. 

Otherwise, if you just want some darn good food and good service-- HIGHLY RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"I suspect the old man who owns the place knows way more English than he lets on.  He's kinda pushy - \"you want soup? you should have soup. i make pumpkin soup today.\"

I didn't want any.  But he insisted.  I didn't regret it.

Great for vegetarians.  Lots of yummy options.  Our table ordered 3 noodles dishes though, and when I said, oh, can I have some coconut rice, he peers down at me through his glasses and says \"No rice for you. No no, no rice.\"

Either he's looking out for the balance of dishes, my health or he just thinks I'm too fat to eat rice."}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian Asian cuisine. The mock beef was fantastic but the mock chicken seemed very slimy. The best part of the meal was the mango sticky rice for dessert--it was to die for!"}
{"text":"I love the concept of a Thai Vegetarian restaurant as I love Thai food and I can come with my Buddhist and non meat eating friends..

Jean's Vegetarian Kitchen services is A+ even as a single diner on a Saturday night I feel really welcome and comfortable. The waiter is extremely kind and attentive.

Love the Pumpkin soup ($3.95).. and the nice fried shallots to be sprinkled on top before eating... hmmm really hearty with a little kick.. not too spicy... great on a cold winter night!

I was a little bit disappointed with the Pad Thai ($8.95), I found it way too oily and did not have too much complex flavour. Though it was nicely presented with chili flakes on the side... so you can adjust your own spiciness... 

For the time being it is a solid 3.5 star!"}
{"text":"Typical Thai menu but made with substitute protiens. tasty to vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Lacking in atmosphere not a cozy date spot."}
{"text":"The service here is unreal. So fast and efficent it almost made my head spin. While everything here is indeed veg/vegan, the pad thai I had was not as good as other's. 

Girlfriend had the pumpkin soup (loved it) and the green curry (also enjoyed). Veggies were perfect on hers. I felt the pad thai was a bit cold for my taste.

Either way, check this veggie restaurant out. It's pretty great, for the most part."}
{"text":"This is an adorable little cafe along the Danforth amongst a sea of Ethiopian restaurants. Just a little reminder that there's more to Danforth Avenue than Greek food...

I enjoyed the hefty serving of house pumpkin soup ($3.50) more than my entree of red curry \"chicken\" ($8.50). I'm not big on meat analogues (the texture freaks me out) but I thought I'd at least give them a try for my first visit. The curry entrees don't come with rice, so I ordered a cup of coconut rice ($2) on the side. When you factor that in, I consider this to be a bit pricey for vegetarian fare.

The best part about dining at Jean's was the extremely kind and attentive service. My waitress (perhaps the owners' daughter?) was very polite and friendly and ticked off all the boxes in the \"how to provide good service at a restaurant\" manual with ease. 

Open for dinner from 5-10pm every night except Mondays."}
{"text":"Soooo disappointing. Jean has left!  The restaurant is under new management. Dishes simply do not taste the same. It's missing that special anise 5 spice which was jeans signature. You could usually smell it as soon as you walk in.  It now just taste like simple Chinese food.   Dishes are small. Pad Thai was way too wet.  Service is still top notch though.  But the fooood :("}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this for a long time based on the great yelp reviews. I've noticed that people mentioned the wait time is long, so we came here on saturday shortly after it opened. Our food arrived at a reasonably time. I saw when they got more customers and the food came out a lot slower. 

I ordered the fried rice with with mock salted fish. This is my favorite. I am surprised that I didn't see any review mentioned this. Highly recommended. It was so good that I ordered another one after we finished the first. 

We also ordered the Pad See Yew, which was flat rice noodles with veggies and mock chicken. It was nice too. 

Another dish we got was the house special veggies with mock chicken. It was not bad but the portion was kind of small for its price $11. It had tofu, broccoli and mock chicken inside. It was nothing special though. 

The pumpkin soup was thick and tasteful. I think it is one of their specialty. 

Overall, the food was not greasy or  salty which is great. The ingredients in most of the dishes are broccoli, tofu and mock chicken, so you may end up eating the same stuff even order different dishes."}
{"text":"I came with high expectations, both as someone who loves vegetarian food and loves mock meats.  I came away liking the experience but being somewhat disappointed.

There were four of us, so we tried several of the appetizers.  Of them, the mock fish was the best but all the options were heavily fried and quite heavy.  The pumpkin soup was excellent but served cold.

The main dishes are quite flavorful and accompany the meal well.  Unlike the appetizers, the main dishes are light and the vegetables extremely fresh.  The mock chicken was disappointing in the  stir fry option; in texture, appearance and in taste.  

The ambiance is not particularly warm.  I don't mind a relaxed decor but this felt fairly cold.

In all, I think I was expecting a lot so am focusing on things that downgraded the experience.  Overall however, it is a solid vegetarian option. 

As a side note, the main options are small in size relative to other restaurants.  I don't mind this but it is good to know if you are hungry."}
