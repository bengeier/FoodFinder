{"text":"Small take out Carribean/Jamaican restaurant with seating space for nine (9) customers.

Employees/servers were very pleasant to interact with.

Ordered the Oxtail on rice and peas with a side of coleslaw but you have the option of a salad instead. Coleslaw seemed like it came out of a bucket. 

Oxtail was very good. Meat was very tender, fall off the bone. Seasoning was good, flavourful.

I also ordered a beef patty. They do not make their own patties though.

Not a deal breaker. The beef patty they offer is good.

Not many Caribbean restaurants in Woodbridge/Vaughan. Living only a few minutes away from this plaza, I will definitely have to try this place again to get a good feel for it.

Price wise, I feel it is a bit more expensive than other restaurants serving the exact same food. But I guess it's a price to pay for having it so 'close to home'.

Also a note, there is no washroom for customers. I can only assume there is one for staff."}
{"text":"Quite frankly, one of the best Caribbean food I've had in the GTA. 

I followed my co-workers here for the lunch special and was not disappointed. Well priced, at just $7, with a choice of jerk, bbq, or fried chicken. I got the jerk chicken and it was spot on, flavourful, tender, not dry at all, and spiced just right. The rice and beans were delicious! It was well flavoured (either already in the pot, or they poured some sauce on top, I didn't catch it), but it was quite tasty on its own without the chicken. There's a choice of sides, and I was happy to see that vegetables was one of them. Lastly, I had to try their beef patties. It was also very good, 10 times better than any frozen stuff you get at the supermarket, and the filling is very flavourful and saucy beef. 

I will definitely return to try their BBQ chicken."}
{"text":"Love the food !!!! So yummy, great place to come for lunch - a welcomed break from your typical generic fast food place!!!!"}
{"text":"Surprising to find this gem in Woodbridge. Great goat, huge selection of soft drinks from the islands. Slow service brought this down from a 5 to a 4. 

4/5 *"}
{"text":"One of my favourite jamaican places. Great food and the owner is a very nice lady. If im in area i usually swing by for a stewed chicken but all dishes are very good and cheap."}
{"text":"The oxtail with rice is a must try. The meat falls off the bone. So does the jerk chicken. Get extra gravy as I think the sauce is a bit plain but their meats are on point. The macaroni salad is delicious & so is their patties"}
{"text":"Closer to 4.5/5 

Prices are great
Customer service is ok we had a caucasian older lady serve us who kept rushing us saying if we want to order roady ( its roti lady who hired you) we need to decide because it takes a while to make. Like no it does not the dmn curry chicken is in front of us u jus put it in the roti self n wrap. Which annoyingly enough she had the privilege of doing and def needs help on how to wrap it. 
Food we got the curry chicken roti , two patties and a drink. She even messed up the name of the drink smh. 
The food itself was great full of flavor w the right amount of sauce and seasoning. The only thing was the curry chicken was not hot barely room temperature.
Ill definitely be back because i know the foods great and theyre Vincey which I truly appreciate. I guess I jus have to check my food before I leave.
Also there is bathrooms i know an earlier review said there wasnt."}
{"text":"Fun and lively take out place! The staff is great and helped us choose the perfect dishes! The jerk chicken was amazing with a perfect amount of spice. I enjoyed it so much, and they have such large portions! There is no where to dine in, so it's truly a take out place but its awesome!!"}
{"text":"Super delicious! Had the oxtail and goat roti. Loved it! The kids had the BBQ chicken. Delicious! Can't wait to try more! Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I go here after work sometimes when I get that craving... you know that craving for some thick gravy on the rice and peas and chicken that has that perfect jerk spice... jeeeze.. I can't wait for tomorrow after work now lemme tell you...

I usually get the large jerk with rice and peas, and it's on point. To not be compared to any other jerk chicken joint because this place is great compared or just a stand a lone spot. 

The people there are nice and always welcoming. The place is pretty small so rolling up in the spot with 10 dudes probably ain't gonna be enough space for everyone to sit. I do usually get it to go.

The food comes out pretty quick so your not waiting 10-15 minutes for food your good"}
{"text":"Fantastic plus.  Like home cooked food but coming from a restaurant.  A hidden gem in this area."}
