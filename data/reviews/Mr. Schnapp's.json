{"text":"Swig & Swine is a cheeky little BBQ joint and bar in an industrial park in the northeast. 
I say cheeky because of the \"Porking in the Rear\" slogan on their sign and also because the waitresses are clad in bikinis.  It's definitely a man's man kinda joint, and a good one at that!
It's clean and friendly, there's lots of TVs tuned into whatever sport happens to be on, as well as a couple of pool tables.  And while I didn't eat while I was there, the BBQ I saw being served up looked and smelled \"swine-tastic\".  
From all I saw, I'd say Swig & Swine would be a great destination for a boy's night out!"}
{"text":"There was no BBQ food!!! just typical pub grub options but disappointing even for the basics that they do serve"}
{"text":"Cool bar, would come back, friendly with a smile. Food is good, bartender is cool, great atmosphere. What more do you want, eh."}
{"text":"New management, no bikinis, no bikers? At lunch anyway 

Great pork, pulled, smoked, toasted, roasted you name it

Very clean, pool tables and vlt's

I like it!"}
