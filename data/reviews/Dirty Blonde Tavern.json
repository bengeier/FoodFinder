{"text":"This bartender here rocks!!! She is beautiful inside and out. Just a genuine great person and she knows her trade very well. I come here a ton and will continue to do so. Especially if Emily is working. Fast and mixes drinks well."}
{"text":"I love this place for happy hour!! Great prices and good food. Also a good selection of craft beer."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service ever. My friends and i waited over 30 minutes to get our drinks. The only thing that kept us busy there were the darts and pool table. Why can't they be like Discount Tire Company and give me great friendly service without attitude."}
{"text":"Comfortable, friendly atmosphere and good service to boot!  Staff is attentive and easy on the eyes.... if you like that kinda thing!"}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite bar.  Incredibly attentive waitstaff and bartenders, fun atmosphere, always something going on.  Great place."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and food. Catch it on a Saturday when they have live music....especially the r&b/soul band.  Service can be spotty if you don't know the severs. Tip good and you'll get a drink fast."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a beer, but do not eat the food, it is overpriced and underwhelming. Specifically, $7 for \"grilled chicken skewers\" that consisted of one flavorless chicken tender cut into 6 mini bites on two oversized toothpicks.  After being served a dissapointing order of 3 appetizers, we noticed no other customers ordered food. We should have taken the lead from the locals and stuck with drinks only."}
{"text":"Dirty blonde is awesome!!!! The food is a 5 and the atmosphere is a 5! I highly recommend this sports bar. Awesome to is the happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"It's a bar and bar tenders and beer and liquor and food  And  tattoos and good people"}
{"text":"Just left this place. Decided to try it out with a group of friends because I got free coupons from them since my work was considering doing an advertisment partnership with them. We get there (5:36), waited 5 minutes looking around then noticed a small sign that says seat yourself. We sat down and waited about 10 minutes. Finally our server came by, she said she was new and that she will grab our drinks and then has to grab a few other tables drinks. So we said okay. She came back with our drinks. After that we didn't see her anywhere in the place for like 30 minutes. Finally she came back and said \"Sorry our system crashed and that backed us up.\" So funny because I saw 2 other servers using the system. We get your new, no need to make excuses. She then asked us \" So is there anything I can do for you guys or...?\" And I looked at her like ummmm take our order? So I told her we were ready to order and she said \"okay brb gotta grab pen and paper.\" So I said okay. She came back, took our order. Didn't know that happy hour was currently on. So we had to tell HER that it was happy hour. Finally our food was in and we were getting somewhere so we all got in a better mood. Then around 6:47 a manager came by with a money box and security and asked us if we are staying for UFC. We said probably not because we are just going to eat and go. She said okay well after 7 we are gonna have to ask you to leave or pay $10 for the UFC fight. I told her what time we got here and that we have been waiting forever to order food. We also questioned why there was no sign at the front or anything about this. You guys couldn't have told us when we walked in? Server didn't bother telling us? The manager gave us an excuse saying the chef was \"fucking up the orders causing us to be backed up so we fired him.\" ( Two different excuses, server crashed and chef fired?) First of all... learn how to run a restaurant because that is not how you do it. Anyways she continued with her chef excuse and then told us that the company charges $1000 for fight night so they have to charge us. We said no we will just leave. What a waste of almost 2 hours. Learn to be a manager and run a restaurant because that... was just ridiculous and awful.  Never again. I left the coupons there on the table because I sure as hell don't want to come back.  Definitely not teaming up with this place for advertising partnerships. Dirty blondes... more like dumb blondes.  They deserve no stars."}
{"text":"Love this bar. Environment and friendly staff make this place great! As a customer, I feel the quality of the food is very good. Prices are great, and always a super experience! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nope, I et hat was believed to be the owner cocky douche bag said his woman owns it too. Hate it when people speak down to you when they believe your poor. There's a reason I dress the way I do, simply I don't want people to think I'm loaded. Hate cockiness hate it hate it hate it. So for that reason, do not believe I would ever return why give my hard earned money to such poor sports. I love local businesses that treat everyone with respect and this isn't one of them"}
{"text":"Very accommodating. I reserved the back area for a going away party. We only had one server but she did the work of 3. She was amazing. Very impressive! Thanks again DBT!"}
{"text":"Great food, good ambiance, plays all the major sports games, and a large variety of entertainment like pool, darts and etc. What more can you ask for, oh yeah, it's very close to home too."}
{"text":"I travel all the time for business so I'm always looking for the \"local joints\" vs. the chain places.  The Dirty Blonde Tavern was a GREAT find for me.  It has that perfect feel of your corner tavern that makes you feel welcome the minute you walk in.  The wings were killer, the beer was cold, the staff was friendly and there were TVs everywhere showing all the games.  What more could you ask for?  The owner (Eva) is a restaurant lifer - so she knows how to work the room and take care of her customers.  Nothing like the (beautiful) owner making an out-of-towner feel like an old friend.   Check it out - you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The Dirty Blonde Tavern is by far one of the best bars here in Chandler. The staff is always very friendly, get to know people by their names, and have very speedy service. They have about 15 beer options of draft, many local craft beers, and great food! I ordered the Caprese Salad and Mac n Cheese bites the last time I went in which were both very delicious! The owner Eva is great as well and is always talking and interacting with all of the guests. They also have live music pretty often, pool, darts, and a great outdoor patio! I would recommend checking out this local hot spot!"}
{"text":"Love this place, great neighborhood bar.  Great service, music is always jamming out.   Fun bar to meet people and play pool or darts and have a nice cold beer or cocktail."}
{"text":"What an awesome place. Bartender is really off the hook. Smart good looking and makes u wanna come back for more. Great service. Kristen was the best server I've had in awhile. Can't wait to see porscha again!!"}
{"text":"Thought this was the place, good food, good service but our Last few visits were just terrible. There were no servers and as we sat at our table for 15 minutes we seemed invisible to the bartender who appeared only concerned with the folks sitting at the bar.  Although when the three good looking guys walked into the bar they were immediately acknowledged.    The DBT is not the place that I thought it was, Good luck Dirty Blonde Tavern, we won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I came in here on July 4th when everywhere else was closed and had a great time. The bartending staff is unbelievable (and hot) and the patrons are friendly. They have pool, darts & great music. If you are in Chandler I recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I love the food. I've had the pretzels w/ beer cheese (made with Kiltlifter) it was really good. Today I had the lunch special-ghost cheese chicken sandwich. It was delicious if you like spicy cheese. They also have bacon soaked in Jäger- it is to die for!!   I am a manager in the bar/restaurant industry so I am pretty hard to please. And this place has exceeded my expectations twice now.   Great Job Guys. Keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"Worst and I meant the worst rolled tacos I ever ate in my life they were definitely microwaved and tasted worse than any other taco I had ever had in my taco life and not to mention way overpriced for the quality. Please stay away from these microwaved tacos! Even Walmart frozen tacos tasted better. Ugh yuck"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time here and another great experience! The employees are super nice and the food is super good, and the beer ice cold as well!!! They have open inside outside which to me makes a difference.  If u want a place with good food and COLD BEER then come here!! :)"}
{"text":"Really cool place in West Chandler. Nice beer selection and the food was really good. The staff was really nice and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. The outside is kind of dirty but otherwise this place is awesome. Hood deals during haooy hours and the food is delicious"}
{"text":"You know the show Bar Rescue? This bar needs to be on it. Terrible atmosphere- they don't know who they are. Are you a dive bar or a sports bar or a biker bar or a live music bar? Who knows?!  The service was terrible and the drinks were terrible. Stick to beer- do not order hard alcohol."}
{"text":"Hands down my new favorite hang out !!!  The owner cares for real !!! Love it here !!!! Thank you Eva for the best experience !! We will be back !!"}
{"text":"Great spot to catch a UFC fight. Not over crowded and drinks are good.  Had to pay a cover to watch the fight but much less then other local spots and they give you a drink coupon with your cover. I'll be back for the next fight!"}
{"text":"this place used to be something else...i don't recall what it was... however the redecorating they did is great.  Love the openness.  The cucumber mule was great,  crisp and delicious.  Service was kind slow,  it was really not that busy for a Friday night so i feel like the wait was unnecessary... however the server was nice. So we may stop back by and try food some time"}
{"text":"So I came in here the other night with a friend and whoa, dude - deja vu! I've been here before - I know it. Something about the location and the layout of the bar and then it hit me - it used to be All Starz Sports Bar & Grill back in the beginning of the century. Used to come here with coworkers for karaoke and trivia back when work was only a few blocks away. Not even sure what it was afterwards but this is the 2015 version. Someone spent some money on the decor and furniture for sure. So we sat down and ordered a bunch of craft beers. Everything I tried from Black Magic was meh. But Grapefruit Hefeweizen I liked enough to get twice. TouchTunes was blaring country music while we were there. Waitresses were nice but they kind of worked in a tag team so we were never really sure which one was OUR waitress or if any one waitress was really \"ours\" - we just went with the first one who asked us if we wanted another beer. For food I went with a 1/2 pound burger with cheddar and Jager Bacon with garlic fries. It was good and came out the way I like it. I also tried some of the empanadas. I prefer empanadas baked and not deep fried so that's probably not something I'd get again. Bathroom was surprisingly actually clean - when I'm at a crowded bar I usually don't expect or pay much attention to this detail LOL. It's in a mall at the southeastern corner of Rural and Chandler at the eastern corner of the strip mall. They have lots of tv screens, pool, darts, all your usual bar suspects - even live music on the weekends. Plenty of parking - it's a mall. Will be back."}
{"text":"Great drinks! Great happy hour! Always a good time. Staff's friendly. Good selection of Appetizers. $5 half order of nachos is larger than full nachos at some places."}
{"text":"We were a group of 20+, there last night. We called ahead days in advance and they had one cook. Our poor server took heat. We le aft after an hour and a half without getting any food. I can say if the food is good. The water taste like it was scooped out of the toilet"}
{"text":"Super cute decor and really nice staff. We only had a couple appetizers but they were tasty. The jalapeño poppers were tasty and the deep fried Mac n cheese bites we're awesome comfort food. The happy hour prices and options were really affordable and the definition of good bar food."}
{"text":"Emily is super dope, great service. Best bartender EVER. Go here everyday if you like good times with good people and amazing service. Food too"}
{"text":"Well done, cold A/C, stranger order shots for us shortly after sitting down, live band totally kicked butt for a Tuesday night. Food was thoughtful...well done Eva, it was nice to meet you , best of luck..great place in a competitive business, you are first class"}
{"text":"This place has gone threw so many owners!  Great food! Wonderfull staff! Perfect for outdoor seating when weather is good! Worth checking out! Live music on occasion so check out Facebook site for updates!!"}
{"text":"Food was great- the soft-pretzel beer cheese appetizer wad fabulous. Service was quick and friendly- we had zero problems mentioned in the other reviews.  Atmosphere was comfortable and relaxed. We had a wonderful visit and will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I came here one day to just chill with my friends, the patio is nice, however it was bar food. Not good in quality ,probably bought frozen from store. However the drinks were good and the people were nice. I'd come again but just for drinks no food."}
{"text":"On 11/29 we had a big group of people going to this place with reservation and wish I could rate it 0 stars.  To start service was horrible, no manager or owner onsite and that was just the start.  Next our group and others around waited and hour and a half and still no food.   Reason was they said there was only one cook for this big place.   No comp for drinks or apologies our group left as did others.  They knew weeks before and the week and this is the best they had?   Clear the owners passion and care for the restaurant is gone and more surprising lack of wanting to secure new customers or profit.  Look to other places to go. Stay Away. I will help others in the group to avoid a similar experience."}
{"text":"Great watering hole close to home. I really like that the bottled deer is on ice and super cold. The service is always great and friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome bartenders! Servers are personal and give that extra effort to make sure your visit is great (shout out to Caitlyn). Really great staff overall. You honestly can't go wrong with the burgers or the wings here.... Both are top notch! Whether you're looking for lunch or looking to catch a big game, it's a perfect place for both. Highly recommend dirty blonde tavern!"}
{"text":"This bar is terrible horrible service and then I realized it's run by the nasty drunk bartender from hobnob I will definitely not be returning"}
{"text":"This is a great bar!  The staff are amazing and the vibe is perfect. Food and drinks are top notch.  The outside patio is welcoming and comfortable. Lots of tv's,  bar games and a good mix of people. The live music last night was excellent. Highly recommend this place! You can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Awesome comfortable atmosphere. Squishy comfortable chairs and booths. The owner is sweet, the staff is friendly, accommodating, attentive. The food is outstanding: Cajun fries (skinny fries are the best!) the burger is great, the artichoke jalapeño dip is made from fresh ingredients and is delicious, the Caprese salad is tasty, the fried things are deliciously fried (jalapeño poppers, potato skins, awesome onion rings, Sriracha chicken bites, the hot wings are good). The pretzel bites with beer cheese are outstanding. I came with a large group. We tried many things on the menu, everyone was quite happy and satisfied. It is all really fresh and with a significant range of food options. I don't drink so I can't say anything about the beer, my friends liked the beer though. There is also a fun trivia game hosted on Thursday evening where you can win gift cards to the bar. Go there you won't be disappointed! Great place, a total asset to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is a great local bar, friendly people.  Seems to be a local hangout for those of us in the Chandler and Ahwatukee area.  Drink prices are great, staff has a great sense of humor, and a great place to meet real locals who like to drink and drink with you."}
{"text":"Great bar to enjoy a beer and a burger.  Great service! Has live bands come on weekends often.  Trivia two nights a week and the owner knows and learns people by their name. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"First time in.  Stopped in for the music. Drinks were good and the wait staff was very friendly and attentive. Music was good and the venue was ok. Not large but cozy. Next time in will try the food quality and quantity. For now this is a place I may be able to call my local bar.  The rum selection is minimal, but,  the waitress said if I come very often they would buy my brand and stock it for my visits."}
{"text":"This is the best place on earth!!! We absolutely love the service and food! What a great environment!  Every time we come here there is always something fun going on, from live music to trivia and karaoke.. I just can't get enough of this place! If you're looking for a great place to spend your time I'd highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Me: \" I'll take (random drink#1 from the bar menu)\" Lady bartender frowns: \"that's a really sweet drink, like really sweet, do you like really sweet drinks?\" Me: \"oooohk, what's your opinion on (random drink#2)?\" Bartender: \"i don't know, I've never made it.\" Me: \"mmhmm..Have you ever tried (random drink #3)?\" Bartender: \"people order it a lot so it must be good\" Me: \"give me whatever drink people order the most of that you've made\" Served...1 sad margarita.  I would have given this place 1 star based on the service, but the ambiance, patio area, darts, pool table.. its a nice bar. Food is meh. Drinks are meh. Worst bartender I've ever encountered, so, don't order anything that will require them to actually mix a drink, or, you know, work."}
{"text":"My new \"Go To\" bar. Just moved into the area and was looking for a friendly, casual place to have some beers and talk to friendly people. DB has a great, laid back fun vibe and the bartenders and servers are awesome - friendly, full of energy and fun. Crowd is welcoming and easy to be around. Bar food is great, especially the tots."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I am there at least once a week with my husband, we always have a great time with pool, darts, and a great patio! They have live bands, trivia and karaoke!  Also ice cold beer, fire ball and decent food specials throughout the week!"}
{"text":"This is a cute place for a bite and a drink or three. There's a large bar, many tables and seems to be a room in the back for private parties. A bunch of tvs all with different sporting events on it. They have big glass garage like doors to open the outdoors in. Music isn't so loud that we all can't talk and hear one another. Mac n cheese bites were awesome! A great crowd pleaser, had to order more. I ordered a plain cheese burger, rare. It came beautifully, a thick enough that I could wrap it in lettuce and eat it with out it falling apart. It was juicy and perfectly cooked. Others had the club and it was made so nice that the toasted bread didn't cut your mouth when trying to take a bite. Onion rings lite and crispy. Fries were thin and crispy as well. Will def return !!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were here a couple weeks ago, had dinner, drinks and relaxed on the patio ( which was absolutely beautiful, loved the decor, the lighting and how the inside was all open to the patio ) they also had great music playing. The service was outstanding,  and all the ladies, were so possitive,  upbeat and even though it was pretty busy they all managed to keep smiling through it all. Not to mention our dinner and drinks were awesome. We would definitely recommend coming here and will absolutely be back soon. Thank you to all the servers and bartenders for the amazing service Great Job!"}
{"text":"This place has been many bars over the years.  I think this is the best one so far.  The menu is okay.  All the times that I've been there it was just a few old men sitting around the bar... However, it was late afternoon so I don't know what the night crowd is like.  One thing that is awesome is Porsche the bartender!  She is very friendly, on top of it, and makes great drinks!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite bar in Arizona!!! Service is always on point, food is amazing and priced fairly! My favorite is the build your own burger- fresh made in house patties grill just the way you like it. That place is always clean and the atmosphere is always comfortable!"}
{"text":"This place rocks your socks off! Great service, great people. Best of all is the bartender Nico..She make amazing cocktails and never misses a beat! If you are looking for a place to hang, I found it!"}
{"text":"A bunch of girlfriends and I decided to try this place out for team trivia and we had a great time. Good bar food like wings fried zucchini, nachos"}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience.  Came in with a large party and two hours later no food for most of us. At one point a plate of food came out every 10 minutes Most of us left after 2 hours of waiting.  I understand with large parties it's hectic but they knew we were coming and still didn't staff right.  They won't stay in business long if if this happens.  25 people come in 20 don't get food and they tell about the experience... Bad deal."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND   I honestly couldn't be more proud of the continued success of Dirty Blonde Tavern!  It seems like some of you don't know the background of Dirty Blonde Tavern by the questions I get, so I'll shed some light...  DIRTY BLONDE TAVERN  Dirty Blonde Tavern is owned by Eva.   Eva has been a bartender throughout the Phoenix Valley for over 17 years, which is how I originally met her. One of Eva's greatest qualities is her professionalism. Eva is always cultivating her following, by texting her hours and location when she's working and is always extremely friendly, without getting too personal or into drama, so it has always been easy to find her when I'm in town. She's not only one of the nicest people I've ever met, but it doesn't hurt that she is also super gorgeous.   Anyway, I got one of Eva's texts last January, 2015, but instead of getting her hours, she said that she had bought a bar at Chandler and Rural, which is now Dirty Blonde Tavern. I immediately went down to her new place, and it already had all of the \"Eva Personal Touches.\"  I've been to many of Eva's parties, and she has always had a knack for design and party hosting, with great food and drinks, cute decorations and awesome music, and that's exactly how she runs Dirty Blonde Tavern. Every time I go in, I feel like it's an open door policy to her personal fun.  You can go in almost anytime and Eva will be there, so you can say hi. Eva is super friendly and remembers a face. Eva is always trying to improve and is never satisfied until everything is perfect; she is very hands on, so if you have any issues, she encourages you to speak with her directly, so she can remedy the situation.  One of the coolest things about Dirty Blonde Tavern are the daily activities that are always going on.   For example, the current activities are: Sunday's - Karaoke Monday's - Rocking Music Bingo & Trivia Tuesday's - Dr. Harley's Jam Band Wednesday's - Team Trivia Saturday's - Brian Legate or Anna Chepikova  February 27 - Honest Soulz  Another awesome thing about Dirty Blonde Tavern are the daily food and drink specials.  For example, today, Monday, 1/22/16, specials are: House Margaritas $4 Silver Mexican Moonshine Margaritas $5 Sleepy Dog Peanut Butter $4 Pumpkin Porter $3.50 Stone IPA $3.50 Mexican Pizzas $5.95 Add Meat $3  The specials change daily, so call or stop in to see what's good.  CONCLUSION   Dirty Blonde Tavern is the kind of place you know you'll have good food and drinks, and feel welcome to join the games or just chill.  5/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *Hours: Daily: 11am - 2am  *For more information: DirtyBlondeTavern.com  ******************************************** Original Review: Okay, I'm absolutely in love with Dirty Blonde Tavern!  Dirty Blonde Tavern literally has everything!  The atmosphere is very edgy and super comfortable.   There are lots of games, including pool and darts.   There is even a cute outside patio.   The music is always great with a good mix between modern and 70's/80's and frequently they feature live music.   Everything I've tried on the menu has been outstanding.  The menu includes:  Appetizers: Artichoke Jalapeño Dip Quesadilla  Sriracha Chicken Bites Chicken Tenders Chicken Skewers Chicken Wings Nachos Fruit & Cheese Plate Jalapeño Poppers Mac n Cheese Bites Mozzarella Sticks Pretzel Bites w/ Beer Cheese Onion Rings Veggie Basket Mini Empanadas  Basket of Tacos  Burgers Chicken Breast Sandwiches Sandwiches Salads   The bar has an impressive selection of IPA's and domestic imports and fantastic mixed drinks.   I've always been impressed with the quality of service. Always a smile and friendly hello.  There is plenty of parking.

{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's quickly becoming one of my favorite places. The staff is on point and the owner obviously gives it her all to make this little bar the best in the valley.   If you're looking for a quality spot with a great staff and quality customers, this is the place. I'm glad I found it!"}
{"text":"This place is around the corner from my house. It was late and we hadn't had dinner. It was a weekday so the place was pretty empty. Our waitress was attentive and helpful. We ordered nachos and some drinks. The nacho portion was huge. They weren't the best nachos I've had but they were good. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best neighborhood bar I've been too! Service is great and very friendly! The food is really good too I will definitely be returning! Keep up the good work ladies!"}
{"text":"Is this place safe to eat or even step into? Their county health inspections reflect very unsafe sanitary habits. Think I'll stay away from the DB. So I tried it out of curiosity. Frozen, microwaved veggie burger. Food safety bad habits observed. Bartender did not wash hands after drinking from open can of Monster. Cook touched numerous items of my order with his bare hands. There is no bare hand variance notice hanging in establishment. Definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"What to say about this place! Lol my boyfriend brought me here.. I at first wasn't sure(I don't like to go out of my comfort zones) .. him and I are now here maybe 3 times a week. Porsche has been one of the most incredible servers I have ever had. She remembers my favorite food orders and drink orders. She greets me like she has known me for years and it makes me feel so welcomed. I recently met Kelly. She helped me on fight night when Connor Mcgreggor was fighting and she was so polite, quick and wonderful. Between these two, and as long as these two are here, I will continue to come here constantly. I'm eating dinner here now as we speak! Love this place! Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in during Happy Hour for the first time.  Great music,  fun atmosphere.  Food was delicious.  Tried the jalapeno artichoke dip and potato skins. Generous amount of chips and lots of flavor in the dip. The potato skins were super cheesy with lots of fresh green onion, also delicious. Servers Caitlyn and Jen were attentive and friendly.  Although busy, both took  plenty of time to explain menu items, happy gour pricing and the numerous craft beers on the menu. This is our new favorite hang out!"}
{"text":"Love the staff, owner, and the regulars are a plus.  Our bar fam!!  The patio is clean and very relaxing.  Try the wings, extra crispy with tater tots!!  Good grub."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I really like the open atmosphere of this place. I came in for lunch and had the tequila chicken burrito which was on special for $7. I was bummed to find out that they did not offer guacamole to compliment the burrito. The salsa was pretty bad. The flavor just wasn't quite right and every other chip was kind of stale.   As for the burrito, no rice or beans offered with it or inside it, which would have made it more wholesome. The burrito itself just had chicken and some assorted veggies inside and the lime taste was a little strange. I may just stick to the standard bar food next time I swing in."}
{"text":"Thank you for the warm respite, Our dark hallways briefly bright,  A balm to soothe damaged souls, Siren song then lingering lulls.  Swaying with the ebb and flow, Time's victorious, tortured tow,  The candle now glows far away, Devil's due then desired day."}
{"text":"How many times in your life are you offered Cajun fries?  Not often enough, if you are not in New Orleans or in the Dirty Blonde Tavern in Chandler, at Rural and Chandler.  Lots of beer on tap, good service, simple, but servicible menu.  The staff makes this place special.  Jordan is always helpful, and Christie is super cute and always willing to help . Portsche always remembers what I drink and greets me with smile. The only tip is to sit at the booths across from the bar if you have a large party.  The booths are high, and comfortable if you have more than 6-10 people."}
{"text":"This location was previously The Sage Bar and their Bleu cheese burger will be missed. Figured to give the new brand a shot, although no Bleu burger on the menu. Also no \"dirty blondes\" anywhere to be found, but we went for lunch. Staff was attentive. Place was clean. The Food: Ordered a turkey club sandwich with their \"Jager Bacon\". The turkey looked like it came out of a prepacked container like you find in the supermarket near the kids meals. (Think Hillshire Farms in the plastic) Nowhere near a deli quality meat. The cheese was a very weak pepper jack. The \"Jager Bacon\" was good except that it was more than half fat and not crispy, just not my preference for a club sandwich.  Some of you may like the thicker bacon, so definitely try it if you do. Fries were an awesome shoestring; the optional Cajun seasoning was sporadic, but tasty. Bottom Line: I would go back and try more of the menu, but I wouldn't be the one to suggest going."}
{"text":"The food is awful! The beer is cold, happy hr drink specials rock! The atmosphere is so cool... Come to drink not eat! It's a shame cuz if u can munch u can drink more!!!!  The owners gotta figure it out. Id be sad, if they closed. It could happen !!!!! We used to go to  a bar down the street they closed bc their food was awful."}
{"text":"This place is nice to come to after a long day at work. It's got a great atmosphere great service good music awesome food and ice cold beer all around it's a great bar when u come u have to get the chicken nachos and u have to ask for the bartender Emily she is amazing or meet the owner Eva she's awesome"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Just had the Hot Stuff Chicken sandwich with a side of Suicide sauce. The chicken is very tasty.  The suicide sauce has lots of flavor and the spicy hotness creeps up on you quickly.  Great stuff!!!"}
{"text":"What a great spot!! The bartender was amazing and super friendly!! The drinks were very good and the place was pretty hopping!! We had a lot of fun.  Energy is key and I always love the energy of a dirty blonde!!"}
{"text":"Place sucked.  2 servers behind bar and one in dining area that thought she worked behind bar. She could only carry one item at a time to any particular table on a very slow Sunday afternoon with 6 people in dining area and tops 10 people at bar.  3 people could not handle this \"enormous \" crowd.  Clueless.  Bars are a dime a dozen; service is the difference."}
{"text":"So creepy in a creepiest kind of way. Want to meet trainwrecks? This is your home. You will never be disappointed by the clientele. As I type there is a drunk a hole cursing his Uber is already here, there is a mother and daughter trying to pick up men but the daughter is all after women only apparently. A couple of kids just left asking dad if he has a ride home and he said he'll drive himself and daughter laughed as she drove away. I would definitely recommend this place to any and all looking for high class trash entertainment. The staff is awesome, at least the three times I've been here. Especially the bartenders. Someone just said \"good night guys\" and the entire patio said drunkenly \"see you roger!\" I think roger was happy to go home.  Have fun, it's a dive bar. The staff is awesome. Just don't tell anyone here where you live or what you do no matter how drunk you get..."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and have been coming in since it was all stars sports bar. This staff is by far the most amazing in the area by far. Friendly, good food good service. Every once in a while there may be issues but the owner address them immediately I find it to be an amazingly friendly, fun service oriented establishment every one should come by and check it out!!"}
{"text":"Nice spot for happy hour to grab a couple of drinks and hang with friends. I had the chicken wings (honey) and they were excellent. The staff was helpful and I even ran into an old friend on my last visit. I had the Bombshell burger on another visit and it was also excellent. Nice little spot."}
{"text":"Dirty blonde is a neighborhood hang out and I hate to admit it because it's not the most sought after bar it's where you go when you've spent too much money downtown but you still want to have a good time and you're not finished drinking. The drinks are consistent and strong which brings me back time after time but I would never, And I mean never ever eat here. You just go here to drink and that's it. And when I mean drink I mean crack open a beer or order a shot they're not serving up dirty martinis with the bleu cheese stuffed olives ya know what I mean??"}
{"text":"Went there few times.their services was incredible.some fine ass women works there which the reason why im goin there again.lok.Summer was the one that served us.thanks alot we had such good times there.youre the best.hopefully we get to see u there again soon:)"}
{"text":"There was an immense kickball tournament in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area this weekend, and we were looking to try something new.  We heard there was karaoke here, so we grabbed some people and headed on down.  Once we arrived the 9 of us grabbed a table and ordered some drinks.  The vibe is very laid back, with a comfortable atmosphere.  We ordered some beers and began to partake in the festivities.  The Karaoke DJ was very sweet, and the rotation was quick if you were looking to sing multiple times.  They had a pretty good selection and a kind crowd.  We stayed for nearly 3 hours and then decided to turn in for the night.  It was a fun time with some new and old friends, can't wait for next year."}
{"text":"First and foremost Brett little blond you might might be cute but your service was very ugly. The fact that we had to ask for silverware and napkins goes to show you the attention they pay you. I will continue to wine and dine until I find the right place . Oh well"}
{"text":"Short on server's.  Karaoke time. Good served until midnight.  Lively crowd. A lot of locals that the karaoke do caters."}
{"text":"This is the perfect neighborhood bar!  The wait staff is friendly, the food is amazing, and if the game you're looking for isn't on, they will do everything they can to take care of you!  Great experience."}
{"text":"I love this bar!!  The service is top notch!! Nicole always has my favorite drink pouring as soon as she sees me. The staff is so friendly and always stops at my table or wherever I am sitting to say hi and give out hugs.  The locals that hang out here are awesome as well.  I feel comfortable bringing my friends and family or just stopping by on my own.  There is always someone to talk to with a smile.  Including the owner, Eva.  If she is around she always takes the time to say hi and she makes sure everyone is having a good time.   I bring all my friends from out of town here and will continue to do so as long as Eva is in charge.  Not only do my friends love this place, they end up making friends with the team and the owner.   Did I mention the wings and the veggie tray?  OMG, they are amazing.  My mom has to make frequent stops here for the hamburgers but, seriously I enjoy everything on the menu.   They have great live music.  You can dance or just enjoy the talent.  It's always a good time!"}

{"text":"Definitely our local watering hole! The menu is bomb and everything is fair priced! The staff is welcoming and make you feel like you're part of the crew! Down here with Chalsey and Krysten not only are they great hosts but they are interacting with the karaoke and making it a great setting in here tonight! Check out their happy hour and karaoke is Sunday night! Just saying!!!"}
{"text":"I never get let down at this place. Once again I had the grilled chicken sandwich, this time with grilled mushrooms, onions and swiss cheese...bam! I always enjoy the friendly bar and wait staff as well. Make this place a must stop...you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"I decided to check out Dirty Blonde Tavern because it is near my home and they had good reviews. I went in to check it out on a Monday night - cool decor, lots of space, pool, jukebox, hard cider and margaritas were on special, and the bartender was friendly and fast to take my order. Based on this quick visit, I thought it would be a great place to host my birthday get together with friends!  I had 10-12 people coming to celebrate at the Dirty Blonde. Unfortunately, the service was awful and so was the food. We had to chase down the waitress to get a food menu and then after 45 minutes of not coming back to take our order, we had to chase her down again. During this same time period we also had people from the table going up to wait at the bar to order more drinks - a similar experience with them standing at the bar over 20 minutes and not receiving service. It took over an hour to get a second round. The problem is this was a Tuesday and they were empty. We were one of only two or three tables - so the service should have been quick.  I really, really wanted to love this place and make it my hangout. I ended up being embarrassed for talking it up to my friends. I wasn't even able to get drunk on my birthday at a bar, after begging for service! Also - the juke box does NOT work. We put $20 worth of requests in and heard only 1 of those songs all night. The food was very mediocre, also - reheat quality. My friends kept asking why we went there and not Sandbar.   The three or four lone patrons at the bar, all middle aged men, received great service. The 22 year old birthday party was completely ignored.   I think this place is full of potential and probably being run by inexperienced management. Your experience will probably differ depending on who is working - beware of the Tuesday night staff."}
{"text":"Love this place! A very nice- chill atmosphere the owner is great and so is the staff. A good place to unwind. The food is delicious and everyone here is accommodating. I recommend coming here"}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices and good food. Variety of beers available on draft or in bottle. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"If your looking for your local \"cheers\" kinda bar this is it!  Lotta friendly faces! And great bartenders.... the girls strive to remember both faces and drinks! A must try... cheers!"}
{"text":"Cool place! Awesome staff! Caitlyn, Danielle, Emily and Nicole are RAD! Check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so bad but by the end of my visit, I never wanted to come back (and probably won't). We waited 10 minutes after finding a seat just to be acknowledged.. After ordering our drinks, the beer came to us flat and tasting like it was old. After ordering another round of drinks, we finally got our order of nachos (after waiting for 25+ minutes), and they were cold and soggy. No plates or napkins either. I felt bad seeing the server literally running around but there were other customers sitting who were waiting longer than we were. We won't be back.. So sad but the service and food were not as good as these reviews say they are!"}
{"text":"having a nice relaxing Wednesday night out on the patio at the dirty blonde tavern a few cold stella beers on special - a nice breezy patio 35+ people inside playing trivia together - met a guy with a  pit bull and learned the history behind pit bulls they were put in pits to kill bulls ergo pit bulls waitress had no ego and no personal / financial motives - showed up to work - to meet people - learn stuff and have fun ' hard to beat that ahhh had such a good time came back a week later get this a small pitcher of Stella 6.50 so $2 a glass grilled wings and Thai sauce great service server had a tattoo of a red rose she had drawn it when her mom died when the server was 16 she also works at the claim jumper and it showed her service was off the chart and I see carbon Jones will be there Tuesday sat 4 feet away from 2 big screens world series on 1 lsu Ole miss on the other"}
