{"text":"Great garlic bread and signature drinks! Husband i will definatly be going back soon!"}
{"text":"We went here as a family last night and were very disappointed. We love to support local restaurants so we thought we should give 55 Chicago a chance as the latest addition to downtown Chandler's dining scene. 

We tried the deep dish pizza, a panini, and lasagna. The lasagna was essentially a pool of cheese and sauce, the flavors were there but the texture was not. The panini was so dry and the veggies inside were mushy (veggies should still have a bite to them). The pizza was the biggest disappointment of the evening. I wanted a cheese pizza and you should know before you go to 55 Chicago, they don't do that. They only make one kind of pizza and refuse to alter it. That was rather insulting. What is worse is that the pizza was just not good. Why would you only make a pizza one way and that way is terrible?  

The server did a good job, was very polite and helpful. I did like the design of the architecture and the patio was nice. Hopefully they turn it around and succeed."}
{"text":"Had a few drinks at the bar and Chiara provided us with excellent service!! The cocktails were well made and the antipasto platter was a great snack. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow, and the place was nearly empty. Garlic bread had huge chucks of garlic on it and tasted dry and from the freezer. Don't ask for the deep dish with just pepperoni, you have to get it with pepperoni and sausage together - all or nothing. We were given two different copies of the beer list? Less than impressed with the food menu, would rather eat elsewhere and stop here for a drink. We had to chase our waitress down to pay our bill. Nice ambiance and place, but they better get it together to keep up with the rest of the bars downtown."}
{"text":"I had very high hopes for this restaurant. I ordered the Polenta and Meatballs, my sister got the turkey burger, and my parents got the deep dish pizza. The polenta was so salty, it was practically inedible. The meatballs were good, and were the only thing I ate out of my meal. The burger was alright, nothing special. The deep dish pizza was sub par. Overall, the food just had too much going on in it in the way of seasoning and was just disappointing."}
{"text":"How this has good reviews I don't know. 

The good. Jamal is DJ there on Thursday and takes personal request. The restaurant has a pretty modern decor. The martinis are named after different location in Chicago.

The bad. There is no deep dish pizza or any pizza for that matter. The new menu is a mix of just things thrown together to get a menu. Garlic bread never seemed like an appetizer in my opinion.  I wish I tried a martini instead of ordering a drink heavy on puree and very little alcohol. Nothing besides the martinis was about Chicago, Illinois, or even just the Midwest. And yes this place theme was originally supposed to be  Chicago theme (i verified) but now it's just a place.

The ugly. I wish Ramsey Kitchen nightmares or Bar Rescue would come and help this place out. It has so much potential and failing miserably. No theme at all."}
{"text":"What a find! Been to the Perch so I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. This place was great. We went on Sunday night on Memorial weekend so probably not your typical crowd. Basically no crowd. Service was very good. Beers were OK, only reason for 4 and not 5 stars. South side Red was tasty but Hefeweizen (55 S'Wheat) was not very good. Not light and not citrusy. Food was excellent. I had lasagna based on server recommendation. I did not expect it to be an entire platter. (See pic). Flavors were wonderful, I would have ate the whole thing, but it was just too much. I would've taken it home but we were on vacation and no place to put it. My wife and aunt shared a Deep Dish pizza which our server warned us it would take awhile because it was fresh cooked. It was very good. I'm no deep dish expert but it was more than enough for two. Bonus for the night there was a blues duo, one on the harmonica and one guitarist. They were very good. The guitarist look young (mind you I'm old) but he had such a soulful soul. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great beer and great food. All these people from Chicago claiming it's not as good as the food in Chicago. I don't think it's supposed to be \"Chicago food\" it's named after being on 55 Chicago street. Sooo, let's not crucify this place because a restaurant in Arizona doesn't taste like a restaurant in Chicago. The place looks really neat and the atmosphere is fun. When I was there I split a salad and the deep dish pizza. I'm not usually a deep dish gal, but it was pretty good. Probably not up to Chicagoans standards, but I would definitely go here again to see what other dishes are good. I'm not a \"yelper\" or anything, but I think this place deserves a better than 3 and a half star rating and had to throw my thoughts in."}
{"text":"I just ate and had drinks here last Friday with my girlfriends after work. We actually intended on eating and having drinks at The Perch, but didn't want to wait for a table. So we came here to Chicago 55 instead. 

The drinks were about what I expected, no mistakes there.

I ordered a cashew salad and I asked the waitress if it had actual cashews in it or if it was just the cashew dressing because the menu didn't specify. The waitress replied \"I don't know\" and then continued standing there waiting to take my order. I asked her if she could find out because let's face it, whole cashews are where it's at! A cashew dressing only just isn't the same. She went to go ask but acted like I was putting her out of her way. It's a shame that we received such poor service because all the other staff there was friendly and really helpful! If you go, chances are good that you will receive friendly service! 

And for those who are wondering, YES, the salad does come with cashews on it. It was just an alright salad though. It was definitely missing something. The French fries my girlfriend ordered to share were really good though and cooked just right!

Would I come back? Yes. I would give them another try. I think they have some really great staff members despite our main server that night. Would I order the cashew salad again? No! But they do have a salmon wedge salad that I would love to try. 

Likewise, I would like to mention they have a really great patio area - it is nice and open and the tables aren't seated too close so you can have a little bit of privacy and not everyone can hear your entire conversation. 

There is plenty of parking available in the lot directly north of the restaurant. Yes it is a sucky lot, but at least you don't have to park a mile away to go there. 

That's it! I'll update my review after my next experience there."}
{"text":"Overall ambience and the decour were great. Also, everybody working there were friendly, and welcoming.  But as others have said, the food at best was average. The highest grade was a 7,  and the lowest grade was a 4. . The average was 5.5. One person had the pizza, and said there was a spice in the sauce that was not very good. 2 of us had a sandwich type meal, and the bread was hard, the other person commented that the top of her mouth was cut because the bread was so hard.  The last person had the Polenta and Meatballs,  and she said it was good, and she rated it a 7. Now they have only been open for two weeks, so I would expect the food will get better. I'll try one more time in a month."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. I loved the look and vibe of the restaurant. Service was great, drinks were excellent...you have to try the cucumber martini!  We just ordered a few items from the happy hour menu and they did not disappoint.  We ordered the garlic fries, antipasto platter and onion soup. All were very delish. I will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I would give it maybe 2.5 if I could but it was over priced, very unorganized, the staff was not trained very well and waited forever for our check. The food was just ok. 
I nibbled on my friends deep dish pizza, and it wasn't great. I ordered a red sangria and it was ridiculously sour!! so sour that it made my stomach upset."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this for a while and their sister restaurant The Perch was full. So we tried this place.  

Nice layout. Open. Patio in a nice night.
But...

The staff seemed like they would rather be some place else.  Nice, but sort of \"meh\" vibe. The menu short.  Not a lot of choices. 

The good was good, not great. As an example the bruschetta toppings were good, but the bread was not really toasted and crunchy like it should be.  

I hade the chicken Parmesan. Again good but not wow. Not a lot of flavor in the sauce or chicken. 

The wife has pork tenderloin. A bit fancier. But again, well executed and not bad. Just didn't stand our  

When we left at 8:30 it was only half full.  We both felt we would eat there again if other places were full, but not make it a destination. The location and layout are great.  They just have to add something to make the food and the staff more energetic. 

It was a gorgeous night and we had a good time."}
{"text":"Sad but it looks like this place is closed.  Doors shut on a Sat night and I had heard they were only open a few days a week prior.  Call before going to confirm."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday right at opening. They weren't really ready. The bar top was a little sticky... Should have been cleaned better. For food the hot dog was really good. The fries not good. Scorpion bowl was great. Bartender was good but he was distracted with other things going on in the bar. Will try again someday."}
{"text":"Oh, just a quick but late update - ended up coming in here on St Patricks Day because every other place was packed.  They had 13 open tables (I counted them) and space at the bar...meaning it was very, very empty for St Patricks Day.

The server said it would be about an hour.

After laughing, I looked at her and realized she was serious.  So while she was still in mid-sentence, I grabbed my group and we walked straight to the bar, where there were more than 4 seats available (there were a ton, because this place is a stuffy fuckhole), and we sat there and drank beer for a while, because it's St Patricks Day and even when the bar you're in sucks, you stay there if there's ample room because every other place is wall-to-wall packed.

About 90 minutes later, I turned around and counted.  There were 12 open tables still.

Good job, hostess, on being as much of a disaster as the bar you work for!  

Seriously, can these people do anything right?"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst experiences at a restaurant I have EVER had!! Being in old town chandler right next to some of the best restaurants we figured it couldn't be any less good. First off, It seemed like it was the waitresses first day, she messed up multiple things and when the food FINALLY came out after ordering simple things, it was terrible and bland. My friend actually had to spit something out it tasted so bad. When it came to getting the check, it was like our waitress went home for the night, she was no where to be found for what felt like an hour. Stick to what you know inold town chandler, do not go here!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a great night out. We sat at the bar... found two open seats right away even on a busy Friday night. The calamari was outstanding and the edamame too. The staff was undermanned, but they kept up their great level of service. The bartenders were amazing with getting our food and drinks prominently, and even greater when our babysitter called for us to return immediately due to a sick child. A different bartender immediately canceled our drink order and ran our bill to get us out quickly. He was very empathetic about our situation and we really appreciate it... and that is the main reason why I decided to write this review... they deserve it for going above and beyond."}
{"text":"We tried 55 Chicago this week for the 1st time. It was hot outside, about 112 or so. They had all the big overhead doors open so it was hot inside as well, you could not tell if they had the A/C on or not. The beer was not that cold when it came from the server and it got warm very fast after it was delivered. We ordered deep dish pizza, the crust was great but the filling was really soggy. The happy hour menu does not offer much, i.e.  $1 off draft beer. We might give it another try in a few weeks or we might not"}
{"text":"I love the looks of this place- and it has a great patio. I am giving it 3 starts because the pizza was slightly disappointing for a Chicago pizza joint. Our services wasn't the greatest, but I think it will improve over time as the restaurant is still new. I will be back for happy hour and drinks."}
{"text":"This place is great for what it's trying for! The food is tasty and the beers are great. Mainly the beers are from sister property next door, The Perch. There's a huge projector area outside which will be great for football season which we'll be back for. Overall great place to grab a small bite and grab a beer"}
{"text":"Best burger ever!  Travis is the shit, when was the last time you saw a bartender run to serve his customers!! My new favorite downtown chandler."}
{"text":"This place is owed by the same people as Perch, so I'm told. Stopped in for a drink with a friend for Happy Hour. We tried the meatballs and had a couple beers. Meatballs were fantastic... They did a great job on them. Beer was fine... The copper color bar itself looked really nice and is a cool reference to the Copper State... They definitely need to donsome fine tuning... hopefully they will get everything else on the same level as the food."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Marginal service. Will never return.  We asked the waiter what he suggested as their best dish and we ordered one of his recommendations.  The chicken parmesan was the worst I have ever had.  The chicken was so rubbery that it might have been prepared in a microwave.  Even the tomato sauce on the ziti was awful.  I recommend you don't waste your money at this restaurant.  Go down a block on Boston Street and there are many other dining options."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Saturday night and started off disappointed that they ran out of a couple items. We were ready to leave but the GM personally came by to try to make things right and was very accommodating and we gave it another try. Food and drinks were great and they really try to make it a great experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"Steak sandwich with peppers not bad ain't awesome 

Chicken Parmesan wow I mean absolute garbage chicken was tough and very bland idk what they put in there sauce but it tasted like Pure Vinegar 

Fries was good 

Service was friendly"}
{"text":"Drove by Saturday night, new pub looks great and looking forward to trying it. Just opened on April 20th. Downtown Chandler keeps getting hipper and hipper. Love living in Chandler."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly service and pretty good food. Not the same as being back in Chicago but about as good as it gets out here. I have been there a few time and have stuck to the Chicago style foods thus far but have have an enjoyable experience each time. Also have a decent happy hour, specials are OK and not too crowded."}
{"text":"S0 very cute. Love how it's decorated but one of my worst pet peeves is  I bought a beer gave him a $20 and he asked me if I wanted change? Like I'm really going to give you a $16 tip I don't care if it's two dollars don't ask me if I want my change ..."}
{"text":"6:20 pm on a Friday - came in to have a drink at the bar...hostess didnt know there werent seats at the bar and didnt offer one of their several open tables (who knows maybe we would have had more).  Three spots at the bar being held with sunglasses.  As we walked out 2 minutes later all the hostess had to say was \"have a good night\" as she leaned on the hostess stand.  Yawn - unimpressed. We wont be back.  With the new competition one block away unless they step it up and I hear positive reviews from friends - this place wont be around long."}
{"text":"1) had to wait about 15 min before wait staff even knew we were seated to at least get water!!!
2) thank goodness staff were nice
3) wait staff not knowledgeable on what beers were available
4) waiter leaving our table's Moscow mule at the bar, within our sight, for 20 minutes or more while the rest of us savored our drinks
5) birthday girl not getting her sweet potato fries, but offered bday gal a dessert- even though she's not a fan of sweets
6) birthday girl's hubby's pork served raw, but mgr taking it off their bill
7) garlic bread that wasn't garlicky or toasty
8) one of the wait staff thinking that theye were going to get away with something when bday gal and hubby gave them a $100 for their $30 bill (the mgr later took care of it, but one should never have to have troubles with getting the correct change in a timely manner) 

*****************in a nutshell: understaffed, unacceptable excuses given, food improperly cooked, forgetful staff that was there, dishonest staff = recipe for disaster*****************************************

p.s. Our table of nine work for a variety of companies throughout the valley that regularly dine out. This will not be a place we recommended, and we will make sure to spread the word to be careful when coming here as you may get cheated on your bill."}
{"text":"Great beer and location. I was a bit slow for a Friday night. Menu seems a bit limited but food is good"}
{"text":"Well.  This sucks. Out in Chandler. Heard some music. Investigated. Wish I hadn't. It took 15 minutes for someone to come get our drink order. In the meantime we sat listening to the crappiest music ever. I think they found this  DJ on Craigslist when their Angie's List person stood them up. There's like 15 people in here and we all look like we are being held here against our will. If you read this do not come here to help. The sound of music will draw you in. Resist the urge. You do not care about these songs. They are not popular. They never were. And I think the bass may explode my phone. Stay away."}
{"text":"Great ambience and the service is great as well. The issue I have is with their food and drinks though. The food unfortunately is no where close to Chicago style and unfortunately misses the Chicago aspect of having something for everyone. We asked for a vegetarian deep disk pizza and were unable to accommodate that since all they have is meat sauce. There food and drinks are unfortunately mediocre at best and they do not serve desert. They did have a live dj on Saturday night although the place seemed like a ghost town. I would not seek to venture into this place until they revamp the menu."}
{"text":"This place could've been great... walked in on a Friday Night and DJ was playing some good beats. Ordered drinks throughout the night. When it came to paying my tab, the bartender handed me somebody else's card and wanted me to sign off on it. I told them that it wasn't my card and I got the brunt end of the stick. The manager told me to just sign and get out. They said to \" not come back. \" We will oblige, and never go back!!! Avoid this place if you expect adequate service!!!!!!!

On the plus side,  the bar serves the infamous Scorpion Bowl!! Very strong, in a good way! Wish I could go back and have another, if it weren't for the poor service"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, hot, and didn't take long to bring out to us!!!!!  Atmosphere is great!!  I love the decor.  The drinks (cocktails and wine) are overpriced.  They don't have a dessert menu which would be nice.  I'll be back again though!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a good store front and location. Plenty of parking and seating. They have live music on weekends which we will definitely come back and check out. 

Staff was very friendly and helpful. We were pleased with our service. It wasn't very crowded as we visited on a Sunday afternoon and we sat inside at a booth. 

We had the Hot Italian Beef sandwich with garlic & herbed fries. Portion size was good and our meal was very filling. Peppers had a bit of a kick to it which left you coming back for more. The garlic herb fries were heavy on the garlic which I love but you could easily leave that part on the plate."}
{"text":"I don't know why came I brought my friend's dad here for a dinner, but the service was very horrible, I had to wait 20 minutes to get help I would highly not recommend coming here you're better off going somewhere else than this place"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with friends for drinks during peak times on Saturdays.  If you can find an opening at the bar to order your drinks, you will get them fairly quickly.  However, once you go to the back patio, service is non-existent.  The atmosphere of the patio is fantastic, decor is great.  But for as huge of an area as it is, you will NEVER see a server back there.  Our bar tab there, for 6 people, would probably be around $150-$200+, but because of the lack of service, we get one, maybe two drinks and we go elsewhere.

Being from Chicago, I had to try the Italian beef.  The beef is outrageously dry.  It has the texture and flavor of being boiled.  No sear or even a bit if browning, just boiled meat.  No amount of au jus can save the beef that's drier than the Phoenix desert.  This place needs to seriously step up their game, when I can make a better sandwich, at home, with probably less expensive ingredients, there's a big problem."}
{"text":"We love checking out new places in DC! We sat outside until the rain forced us under cover. It took a long time to get our food, but I assume that is just early jitters. The food was priced a little too high to make this a regular stop and the beer list was surprisingly limited. Regardless, as my husband said we could have been in Portland! The vibe was great for a rare stormy AZ day. Once the summer heat hits,  I imagine the musters won't cut it. I hope they add some less expensive menu items or appetizers, but if you like trying new places I would check it out!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday night. The place is done up real nice; great ambience.  The canned beer could be about 10 degrees colder. I tried 2 and they were about the same.  The food ordered was the Chicago dog and the hot Italian beef sandwich. Both came with garlic herb fresh cut fries. The hot dog you could tell was boiled, which made it very mushy. I don't know if the are trying to replicate a Chicago dog that comes off a cart but grilled would have been better.  The hot dog was dressed out pretty good sans the mushy consistency.  The hot Italian beef sandwich was ok but was missing something. It was dressed out with peppers, onions, jalapenos, etc.  From experience, the beef should be cooked with the peppers and onions; it did not taste like it was. The fries were excellent.  This place has potential with some tweaking of its menu and food prep.  The menu could have more appetizers or share-able plates. I imagine it has a happy hour but I did not see anything about it.  I may be willing to try it again if I see some changes to the food."}
{"text":"Merry Holiday!! Couldn't resist the balmy blazes burning from Chicago 55's fireplace! Like a moth to the flame, it called Tony's while we were driving by! We had to turn around! Boy are we glad we did, excellent atmosphere, football, and drink menu anyone would enjoy. From America's favorites to local tastes, broad & beautiful."}
{"text":"First, I give this place 2 stars because the hostess, waiter and the manager were all approachable. It made a good first impression the moment we walked in and got seated. 

The good first impression didn't last long. It took more than 30 minutes for our appetizer (garlic bread) to get served. We ordered polenta and meatballs, hotdog and deep dish pizza. Again, it took them another 20 minutes to bring the food to our table.The polenta was way too thin, it was barely there! The sauce was also bland and the worst part is, they made us wait so long and the pizza was served cold. The crust was hard and the sauce lacked flavor.

The manager was more than willing to listen to our feedback but that was it. We understand that this is a new place but that is never an excuse for a restaurant business. Downtown Chandler is a very competitive area and word gets out really fast. With all these being said, for now, we do not recommend this place to anyone who wants to unwind after a long day at work."}
{"text":"Came in here after an early Sunday dinner next door at The Perch because of the great live music and vibe! Awesome craft beers and cocktails but can't wait to return for the food! Great menu! Will be one of our new fave spots!"}
{"text":"We had never heard of this place. We were walking around downtown Chandler after the Jazz Festival and were hungry, and saw it. My husband ordered Salmon which he usually does at restaurants. He said their Salmon was the best he has ever tasted (and he has tasted a lot of Salmon!). He even gave compliments to the chef! I ordered a cheeseburger that was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Stopped by on the opening day to check out the scene and enjoy a craft beer.  The beers on tap  are supplied by the Perch which is basically in their backyard and they had 2 guest beers from 2 Brothers in Scottsdale.   There is patio seating in the front and wrapping around the back with a very large indoor/outdoor bar.  Will definitely be back to try out the menu."}
{"text":"We were excited to try something new, especially because Downtown Chandler had been improving their restaurant possibilities. The draft list was ok, mostly craft beers that most people have never heard of, but plenty of other options in the a can. The food was ok. Nothing really special but nothing was bad.

All of that being said, the entire restaurant is enclosed with garage doors that are left open. The vibe is pretty cool, once the hot AZ sun starts to go down. BUT there a flies and other flying insects. I don't know if it's the time of year, but I fished little bugs out of my drink and food all night long. If I wanted a picnic, I'd pack a cheaper lunch and share with the insects. Not for me!

Also, it was pretty slow while we were there 4 tables were seated - and it still took a while to get our food and our check."}
{"text":"I've eagerly waited for months for this restaurant to open. My hometown is Chicago and recently I moved to Chandler. I saw this restaurant being built several months ago and was so excited to see a Chicago restaurant in downtown Chandler!

I am absolutely disappointed that I couldn't give 5 stars! I had visited over the weekend with a group of 8. A few of us don't eat beef or pork so there weren't many options. We were excited to try the deep dish pizza. They only have one option for deep dish which they can't remove the meat. So I had shared the chicken pasta with my husband. The dish was ok. Not something I would seek out for again. Something about the red sauce on the chicken didn't taste so good. Too sweet? The pasta may have been under cooked because it tasted a bit crunchy.
One of my friends had fries that had really no flavor. Another friend had the sweet potato fries and she was disappointed with those too. My husband and I ordered the garlic bread which was ok. It was weird though because another couple ordered the same thing and they had chunks of garlic cloves on it which they had to pick off. So there was also no consistency on how the food was being prepared.
I had ordered a O'hare International cocktail. It looked cool but tasted pretty strong and just not good. I had other people at the table try it and nobody liked it. I ordered a Moscow mule thinking they can't mess this up but that didn't taste good either.  ( I think the bartender needs to try his drinks.)
I gave two stars because the restaurant ambience was really nice and unique! I loved it! There was a dj setting up when we left which I would love to come here if it mean't this was a place for dancing.
Overall, myself and the group we were with were pretty disappointed. I REALLY want to love this place. I could refer SO many people here too and I can see it being a great spot. Since they have been open only a couple weeks I hope that they revamp their menu and make some changes. I will wait a few months and try it again."}
{"text":"Meatballs and polenta are da bomb!!! The beer selection and prices are really good.  Service is not too bad"}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome.  There were four of us and we all ordered different entrees. We all tasted each other's and all the food was unbelievable.  Our server Abbie was amazing and the manager Matt is the bomb!  Will recommend to everyone I know.  We rate this restaurant a 100!!!"}
{"text":"The food, decor, service and ambience were really good.

And though it was a warm evening outside (about 100 degrees), we agreed to sit outside because of the ample misters and light breeze.  When it started to rain, they moved us under the covered porch, next to the unlit indoor/outdoor fireplace (a beautiful, modern feature with a glass back facing the outdoor deck).

As our meal arrived, they lit the fireplace.  And though they turned the gas down upon our request so the flames were not so intense, it was 100 degrees outside - and we were sitting next to glass wall radiating the fireplace heat directly to our table.  Had it been winter, it would have been divine - but guys....its summer in Phoenix.

The deep dish pizza was great and reasonable and we'd go back for that.  Just be cautious where you sit!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the downtown Chandler scene. We are already big fans of Perch and we're excited to find this cool sister restaurant set-up themed in cool Chicago signage with ample patio and hip inside space. They have fire pits and show movies outside Really good beers and solid, tasty modern take on Italian classics - we loved the Parm,  the lasagna and the Chi dog. Really enjoyed this place and plan to be back again!"}
{"text":"They have a mixed selection of booze servers don't know the stock appetizers are great. But don't bother with pizza or lasagna not where unworthy. Even the bartender suggested another bar. It gets cozy after 9:00 pm atmosphere is calm and relaxing for drinks and appetizers but it ends there. You might try the gummy bear shots the manager gave us after multiple drink prefer errors. Food came out of the kitchen very sporadically not good for a group of more than four or so. Cheers."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  So I had to ask the people working there why they had so many bad reviews on here, and the answer is: because those reviews were all made during the first couple weeks they were open, and yes they had some problems at the beginning.  But they've been open 3 months now and here's my good review:  

I'm from Chicago and thought the deep dish pizza tasted just like an authentic Chicago deep dish pizza - probably the thickest crust I've ever seen - it was delicious!  My friend had the pork tenderloin sandwich and it also was to die for.  It came with sweet potatoe fries and their homemade ranch to dip it in and it was the best dipping sauce I've ever had.

I'm a martini girl and their cucumber martini was probably the best martini I've ever had.  The atmosphere and vibe of the place really did make me feel like I was back home in Chicago and it just had a genuinely good, fun feel to it.  The staff was so nice and on top of everything and very knowledgeable.  I had a great time and will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and really great happy hour specials. The lasagna was fantastic and was complemented by the drinks. Very friendly and attention river service."}
{"text":"New place next to the Perch. Been open a few weeks and went there to check it out. Great beer selection on draft. Try the \"Red\" draft. Food also is really good. Service is top notch."}
