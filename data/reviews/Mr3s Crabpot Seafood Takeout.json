{"text":"Made a special trip from High Point to Charlotte just to see what everyone was talking about.  I was not disappointed and will come back again."}
{"text":"This is probably the best seafood I've had in my life .I wanted to but a gallon of their butter sauce but was told they no longer sell it due to it being infringed. But any way I had the super seafood platter an a side of mac the bomb.com will be back mannn"}
{"text":"We had a 40man professional baseball team in town playing the Knights.  Rob and his staff prepared a great meal for our group.  We were very pleased with the service and the product.  Highly recommend Mr3s for your personal and group events.  Thank you for the great seafood"}
{"text":"I'm advent seafood lover coming from Charleston, so when I move to a new area I do my best to locate seafood restaurants and markets... IMMEDIATELY. This restaurant is a must try, with portion sizes being hefty size and prices reasonable. I ordered the loaded potato and it was delicious!! There was bit of salt but I knew it just the seasoning. Oh and I LOVED the spice. Reminded me of NOLO.

The parking lot is small, along with the waiting area inside the restaurant. There is limited seating in the waiting area. Be prepared to wait a minimum of 15 mins, as the food is cooked to order. 

Hands down go check them out!!"}
{"text":"I drove about 20 mins to get to this restaurant, I think I'm officially addicted.  This is my second visit in two day!!! Decided to try something new the Vacay Shimp and Salmon (Half Pineapple stuffed with their specialty  rice and top off with salmon and shrimp). Absolutely delicious!!!! I can't wait until my next Visit so I can try the lobster and crab platter!

 You must try the Seafood MAC and Cheese!"}
{"text":"My score is low because I can never get close to this place. It is always jamb packed. But if the crowd is any indication, it is a must try. I will re post if I ever get in."}
{"text":"This is regarding the SC location: tried it for the 1st time yesterday. First let me say the food was awesome!! I can't give 5 stars just yet because that experience was HECTIC lol (this may change as they grow) My Mom wanted a seafood dinner to celebrate her bday so I called ahead to see if they had sit in dining and was told yes. I guess they \"typically\" do given they have a few bar stools at a wall facing ledge and 2 small 1st come serve card tables but you and I both know I was expecting more of a restaurant like feel when they said yes to that question. Nevertheless we were able to order our food and snag a table so we were still going to grub and make the most of it (but that dropped them to a 4 star rating) next came the fact that my 8yr old had to use the restroom and wouldn't you know there was not one!!! I had to leave part of my family there to hold the table and wait for our food while I drove around the corner to find a restroom hence the 3 stars. We will try them again but will go in knowing to use the bathroom before we go! Oh yeah my husbands car got dinged in the parking lot. No fault of the restaurant just saying it's tight quarters so be prepared. You won't regret the food though the Fried Lobster is the reason I'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Line was long but worth the wait. Drove from Concord to check it out after seeing posts on Instagram. Small space so you can't eat there but hopefully they grow enough to get a bigger place and add some seating. Food was still good by the time we got home."}
{"text":"1st timer: After seeing the advertisement on FaceBook I tagged my husband so he could check it out and told him that I think his FAV seafood place may have competition. He felt the same way from the photos we saw on FB and on Yelp once we pulled it up on Yelp. So we ventured off onto this 45 minute drive to experience Mr3s on Fathers Day weekend per my husband request.

The location is interesting to say the least and I'll leave it there. The restaurant is HOT, small and did I say HOT? They don't have restrooms but the sweet cashier Jada informed me that there was a Wendy's nearby so after ordering my husband ran me there to use the restroom as we drove almost a hour to try this place and I'm not sure I could wait another hour plus the time for the food to be completed to relieve myself (TMI). 

We ordered the seafood baked potato, Lobster Tacos & Whiting sandwich also the Mango Peach lemonade.

The BEST item of the three was the AMAZING Mango Peach Lemonade . I wish we brought 4 of those only.
The next best thing was the wonderfully seasoned filet Lobster tail that was atop the seafood baked potato. 
The other two items were MEH: The Lobster Tacos had WAY too much filler (cheese, slaw, lettuce) you couldn't taste he Lobster and the shell was cold and tasteless. The whiting sandwich was OK I wouldn't rush back to get it as I've had much much better.

I like the fact that they show you each of your items when your name is called. This assisted us in discovering that they forgot to put our whiting sandwich in the bag. We ended up waiting longer for that to be made. Being extreme seafood enthusiast this wasn't our FAV place but I encourage people to try them for yourself as the menu is extremely extensive and there is plenty to try."}
{"text":"Never ever had a complaint regarding the food. The parking can be a lil overwhelming. No substitutions, my personal favorite is the shrimp platter. Usually a Saturday must have. Great staff, fresh food upon ordering so it maybe a 10-15 min wait. Great signature punch drinks."}
{"text":"1st visit-Two hours before closing and they were out of 80% of the items on the menu. How disappointing...."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this but after trying it I'm pretty disappointed. The platters are pretty expensive ($25-$40) and you don't get very much food. I ordered the lobster over seafood rice platter for $25.00 and it's barely enough food for one person. The rice was pretty good, as was the shrimp but the lobster was super tough and barely edible. If this had been priced at $10 I wouldn't be complaining, but for $25 I expected more."}
{"text":"I was there today. OMG  THAT WAS AMAZING. The #1 on the menu with Cajun seasoning was absolutely amazing.. lt was a platter combo dear God it was so good. I had to come from ATL to get a plate. It was well worth it. Very similar to WAT'S CRACKIN in Atl both are 10's in my book  Charolette,NC it was great. And Altanta lm on the way."}
{"text":"Two words The Bomb!!!! It's a must try if you are a seafood lover and its definitely a wait in line because it close at 8:00 I would say the wait for food is bout 20-30 cause orders are made fresh"}
{"text":"The food was good. I got the shrimp and chicken Alfredo an my friend got the lobster dinner. I will definitely go back.

This 2nd revised review is just about the spinach lobster dip. It was good but for $9 I expect the container to be full and it was only half full. I attached a pic so you can see. This is by no means a reason for me to stop going here but I won't buy the dip again. I have been back here numerous times since my first review and this is my favorite seafood location in charlotte but no more dip for me at that price I could've got a whole meal."}
{"text":"Wonderful I come here atleast once a month, unless my friends and family come then I bring them. Worth the travel and money. Can't call in and order but I can understand"}
{"text":"For my 1st time there, I must say the food was amazing & I'm allergic to fish!

I could see this place being a usual monthly treat for me! Everyone was friendly & the prices were reasonable for what you get. 

My son's father recommended me NOT to go here...so of course I had to go & try it out for myself! His exact words were, \"You're going to buttery garlic hell!\" In other words, saying that all the food was drowned in too much sauce. 

However I like that it was! I'd rather it have been saucy than dry. However, I digress, go there if you love seafood! 

By the way, I can ONLY eat shellfish. So this review is only based off of the crablegs, shrimp, corn on the cob, sausage and baked potato. Also, the rainbow lemonade was to die for!"}
{"text":"Take out 100%. Only seating is chairs to wait for orders. 

Ordered Mr3 Super Seafood Platter. The food overall is really good but there's room for improvement. The prep of the fried lobster tail was problematic in that the breading turned mushy by time we drove home and because I cook mine with very thin seasoned flour, I didn't care for it. I also really clean all seafood and meats well when cooking so seeing the sand vein in the lobster tail killed my appetite. The sausage that accompanied our meal was tasteless in flavor so into the garbage it went. The other components of this meal was good. 

Most recently we learned there is a dine in location in Rock Hill so next experience will be there. The change will definitely have the lobster grilled and the sausage will still go in the garbage or simply decline it. 

We did get fries and seafood rice (small portion for $4) and total was more than $90."}
{"text":"Ok tried to give them another chance for the 4th time.  They keep enticing me with pics.  My croaker was the size of my palm.  rarely ever ran across a baby size croaker.  Ordered a salmon steak dinner for my daughter and .  Dry as h***.  Mashed potatoes awesome.  But worth my drive and wait...**** no smh."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite seafood places. The spinach and lobster dip is awesome as well as the shrimp and crab Alfredo. Good prices, good food, and friendly service."}
{"text":"Came and got the lobster dinner which comes with (shrimp, potatoes, corn, sausage, and seafood mac). The dried lobster was amazingly well seasoned, and they give you plenty of shrimp. That garlic butter sauce they have in there is  yummy as well. Perfect for the shrimp and crab to dip in. I also got a strawberry kiwi punch, omg it was delicious,..not too sweet, and they don't overload the cup with ice (thank you). This is a take out only establishment, it was worth the drive for me, and I will be back."}
{"text":"2nd time ordering from here. More and likely won't go again or recommend. Over priced and Well over an hour wait. The place is to small to wait for your name to be called inside, so we had to keep walking back in to check. Didn't like the fact they add an additional 3% fee to your order if using a credit or debit card to pay. What really annoyed me as well, after all of the above mess.....I asked for 1 extra butter sauce and the cashier said thats an additional $.75....what??? Really??? My time and money wasnt enough to warrant a free butter?? So nope im done with this money hungry establishment."}
{"text":"This was a very disappointing experience for me... I arrived at 6:15 on a Saturday. As I was in line waiting to order I hear the cashier say to another customer who was ordering, \" we are out of lobster and we are out of Alfredo too\".  When I got closer to the window to order some guy came out the back and said no more fried orders.  I was going to order something fried as well.  I ended up ordering the crab cluster platter and the Mr 3a seafood platter.  I waited about 25 min... no complaints there as I was expecting to have to wait but when I was called to pick up my order is where things went left.  

The cashier opened one of the the boxes to show me my order when I noticed there were no potatoes. The cashier took the box to the back and then returned to tell me that they were out of potatoes.  This is totally unacceptable and why didn't they tell me this up front. If you've ever had one of these platters from any seafood spot, you know how critical the potatoes are to the meal. 

I'm one and done with Mr 3s  and if I want good seafood I will continue to support Seafood Connection. The food I did receive was ok at best but definitely not worth the money or wait"}
{"text":"My sister and I were first to get in line so I literally waited exactly about 23 mins for my food. I was EXTREMELY disappointed that I paid the amount of $$$$ I did to get calabash size shrimp in my Alfredo dish and and seafood baked potato in my meals.  If your gonna pay $20 for a dish give me my $$$\"s worth. Also yeah you see seasonings sprinkled all over your food but flavor is lacking!  Stick to fried fish and crab legs. Anything else may be disappointed.. other dishes you are getting fcked!"}
{"text":"Omg! This place is awesome! There is I other restaurant has crab legs that taste so good! The garlic butter is phenomenal. I'm absolutely addicted! This is a must try."}
{"text":"Great seafood and you get a lot of it. The crab box and the lobster box are delicious. I also had a little of the crab and shrimp Alfredo, fresh and yummy. 

You can order thru their website (sometimes) but if you go and pick up note that the parking is limited and it's not a fast food place so you will need to wait."}
{"text":"Visit date 10/28/2017- So after hearing great things about Mr3s I decided to give them a visit. 

* I had the Seafood platter with shrimp and crab legs. Tho the flavor was GREAT AND EVERYTHING WAS GOOD! I did not get full and it was not fulfilling. And I paid $23.00. I had about 7 to 10 Shrimp and one cluster snow crabs. Next time I will order to just satisfy my seafood craving. 

* if you use your credit card there will be a $3.06 extra card fee. 

* it's hot inside (to me) and only like 4 chairs inside to sit and hard to find somewhere to stand without being in the way of others inline and ppl coming in

* If you are in a rush DONT GO THERE! The line is long and the food is cook as you order (WHICH IS A GOOD THING). The cashier was a bit slow. 

* READ ALL SIGNS AND MENU BEFORE ORDERING! Because cashier don't help 1st timer with explaining how it works. Example I did not know that I have to ask for the garlic butter flavor I though it came that way since most of all the photos i seen had that. After I ordered and standing I seen that on the menu lucky i asked in time so it could be added to my order. 

*The parking IS HORRIBLE!!! HORRIBLE!!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING SEAFOOD. I mean HANDS DOWN THE BEST. I got the two cluster crab platter with turkey sausage, corn, potatoes, seafood rice and seafood mac and cheese. Everything was well seasoned, and melt in your mouth delicious. The menu is fairly priced considering all that you're getting. My only negative comment is the location. The area is a little sketchy, but the food is take out so you're not in the area long."}
{"text":"Customer service was AWESOME ! The food has no flavor . It has seasoning,  plenty but no flavor! It was something i could definitely imitate at home .  Not in the best location . Great prices i paid about $27.00 for one crab cluster , 8 shrimp , 1 corn on the cob , a half of sausage, some potatoes and a strawberry lemonade which taste Great! 10 STARS FOR THE DRINK! The 2 stars were only given because of the Awesome customer service! I will NEVER go back THE FOOD DID NOT TASTE GOOD!"}
{"text":"Excellent seafood and friendly staff. What a treat! All food is to go so this makes a wonderful Saturday lunch w the hubs!"}
{"text":"If you are a seafood lover, this place is a MUST. I have been wanting to try this place for over a year, and I finally was able to see what all the fuss was about. This place was located only 5 miles from my hotel. It is located in a neighborhood and is honestly not the most appealing establishment. BUT I feel like some of the best cooking comes from \"Hole in the wall\" type places. 

First off, this is only a order and take out place. It's very small and gets extremely warm on the inside, so be prepared. They have a sign inside, making it clear that all orders are made to order, so if you are looking for FAST FOOD, you may want to leave. I can appreciate this sign because it prepares you to wait anywhere from 15-30min, but at least your food is hot, and fresh! 

I went on a very hot day so it was really warm on the inside and it was very busy!! People constantly coming in and out. I ordered the Lobster Plate ($25) that includes your choice of grilled or fried lobster, jumbo shrimp, potato, sausage, and corn. I have never had fried lobster so I opted for fried lobster and love garlic, so I asked that my Plate be garlic Parmesan flavored. Waited for less than 20min and it was worth it! My food was definitely FRESH and I had to wait a few minutes to eat it. I really likes the sauce flavoring. I do feel like the batter they use to fry, is too salty. I would opt to get a grilled lobster tail next time as a result. But the lobster was delicious once I got past the breading and  was meaty. The shrimp were perfect, although I wish I got a few more for the price. they serve the (Peel and eat) style shrimp. The sides were good. I would definitely try their other plates that include other items like crab legs, scallops, and crawfish! To all my seafood lovers....when in Charlotte, NC....get yourself a plate!"}
{"text":"Awesome Food. My boyfriend adores the seafood mac & cheese. I had the super seafood platter and an add on of a grilled lobster tail & seafood mac & cheese. My boyfriend had the triple threat fried platter. No complaints on anything at all. This is about the only place I can think of in Charlotte where you can get real seafood in the amounts it should be served. The Garlic Sauce is everything!!! This was my second visit, the first visit we had whiting and shrimp. It was tasty as well."}
{"text":"As far as food goes, Mr3s deserves a 5-star rating hands down! Just know what you're getting yourself into. The location has pretty poor parking. I mean it's not like your parking in a ditch, it just a little lot, with no lines or anything...you just have to use common sense, which ain't always common. Moving on, it's a carryout restaurant. They make this clear from the start. So the need for plush seating, restroom, and other amenities, are kinda expected to be non-existent. Nonetheless, this is what the -1 star is in regards too, poor parking, standing room only in waiting area. 

The food. Oh. Em. Gee. Off the hook. It's worth the wait, everything is made cook to order, which is awesome. The best adjective I can find to describe the food is \"succulent\". It is so good it should be a crime. Its a lot of butter, so just know you've been warned. 

Will definitely return, oh and their tip jar was for a college fund for some of the high school students they had working there. How dope is that. Definitely, have to continue supporting."}
{"text":"My experience today has turned me off coming back here. I usually get the Ultimate potato with shrimp crab & lobster tail & it's usually very good. Got home & no shrimp and a very \"petite\" lobster tail! Called & the unbothered cashier wasn't apologetic & so asked for the manager, Jeremiah who seemed to think that it's just about the food & not customer service as well. Sometimes a simple apology changes things. Will not be coming back especially from across town & will let let friends & family know. Back to Seafood Connection I go. #Unfollowing"}
{"text":"The food is good. If they had turkey sausage it would get 5 stars.
The seasoning is good. Crab legs cooked right"}
{"text":"The location is not a great location because it's not a lot of places to park. It could be considered a hole in the wall, but sometimes that's where the best food comes from. 

It's a very popular so it could be a bit of a wait. You can't call your order ahead. They may need to think abt in the future online ordering and your able to pay online.

One other thing that cld be frustrating is they seem to run out of things. There were a few customers that wanted these rainbow drinks that seemed popular and they'd run out of those. I wanted to try the seafood Mac which they had ran out of.  I ended up getting the seafood platter and steak dinner. The food was delicious and made up for everything else. I would overall recommend because the food is really good, but you may want to come before after work traffic hit because you may not get what your mouth is loomed for."}
{"text":"I have mixed emotions about this place I either am really happy or  I'm not happy I've experienced food missing from my platter, I've experienced cold food, I've experienced extremely long wait times. But what I can say is all in all the food is pretty good its entirely up to the individual on whether or not they want to roll the dice on this place. I have sent quite a few people here and they were pleased with it but for me a good review is about the food and also about the customer experience."}
{"text":"This is the place for seafood. A hidden gem. Don't judge a book by its cover. The food is great and worth every penny. My new spot for seafood"}
{"text":"Love this place !!!!! BEST SEAFOOD SPOT IN NORTH CAROLINA !! The Fried lobster tail is amazing, and the prices are very reasonable if you want good seafood this place is a must"}
{"text":"ADDICTING! DON'T EAT HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET ADDICTED!

They get too much of my money! Only giving it a three star rating because the last two times I went my crablegs were super wet and their platters aren't cheap. When I called numerous times to speak with the manager or owner I never received an answer. I love seafood and this place is the closest to me. Never go there if you're in a rush because they cook your food when you order. Always hot and fresh. That's a good thing if you ask me. Always customers there. Small business, but tasty food!"}
{"text":"The seafood was AWESOME!  Fresh and seasoned perfect.  I will for sure be back when I return to Charlotte.  The reason for the 4stars is because they forgot our side items and once we reached home ready to eat, we realized they were not in the bag, so we had to drive all the way back.  Takes a long time but soooooo worth the wait!!!!!!  Be Back Soon"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I tried it on a Saturday afternoon when the weather was amazing and it was PACKED. When we got there the line was maybe 6-7 people deep but by the time we got our food and left, it was out the door and past the gate. I had crab legs which were great. The shrimp, not so much, they weren't deveined which is a huge restaurant pet peeve and being cooked in the shell prevented them from getting any flavor from the sauce, once peeled they were bland and overcooked. The sauce itself is really good, buttery and garlicky. It's amazing. I also had crawfish which didn't really have much flavor either but I just dipped everything in the sauce. Potato and corn were a nice addition."}
{"text":"The wait was pretty long for the food. The service was OK. The broiled food was not seasoned well. We ordered broiled shrimp and crab legs. The fried shrimp on the other hand were delicious! All plates comes with potatoes and a sausage link. The sausage also lacked flavor. I only took one bite. You can add sides but they need to make them optional for the plates. The food is pricey compared to most of the seafood restaurants in Charlotte. If I go back it will be for the fried shrimp and to try the pasta."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves both fried, grilled, and steamed seafood. The establishment is a hole in the wall....Take Out restaurant, BUT don't let that fool you. Hole in the wall establishments serves some of the best food and this place did not disappoint. Seafood is the primary food served so don't expect Hole in the wall prices; however my meal was worth every penny. I ordered the grilled lobster and steamed shrimp over Cajuan seafood rice (baby shrimp, crawfish, crabmeat). The was good in quality, quality, and flavor.  The caribbean peach mango punch was sweet and tasty."}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS! For our first time, my wife and I kept it simple and just tried the crab clusters and shrimp. They were unbelievable! The crab and shrimp were fresh and meaty, the seasoning was savory and lightly spicy (just right) and it was all seriously drowned in delicious garlic butter! We can't wait to get more!

Speed of service was good too. They don't accept call-in orders and everything is made fresh, so I expected to wait 20-30 minutes (per the sign in the waiting area), since there were 5 other people waiting for food ahead of me. To my surprise, my order was ready in 15 minutes!

Great experience!"}
{"text":"Those crab legs are to die for, I am mad I can't go today. I love that you guys are giving them young adults responsibilities and having them work they was fast but not rude that's a great look."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Charlotte for the weekend and I found this place on Yelp and thought we would try it. The food was delicious, I gave 4 stars only because it's only a take out, would have loved to sit down and eat and the fact it closes early on Saturdays, but my husband loved it and he is from Baltimore. The Cajun Triple was very good.  Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Great seafood in Charlotte. Lots to choose from on menu. Crab legs, lobster tails, shrimp,  crawfish, any type of seafood you are looking for."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They only do take out but it is so worth it and they are fast so the wait isn't too bad. P.s. Get extra Mr.3's sauce with everything"}
{"text":"Definitely did not disappoint on the super seafood platter. I added the garlic Parmesan sauce and it was divine! My container was bursting with crab legs, lobster, shrimp, and the fixings for a southern crab boil. Would've preferred a different type of sausage but it was still good. The mango-peach punch was  ok but needed a tad more mango-peach flavor. It's halfway across town but I would definitely be back again.  It's worth it and the hype is well deserved. There is a little bit of a wait so if they take call in orders you might want to take advantage of that. If they don't, then don't go when you are in a rush.

Only one note: one of my potatoes was practically raw so they might wanna watch out for that. But other than that everything was really good."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! I want to thank whomever sent the Facebook post about Mr. 3's. This place is amazing. The shrimp and crab legs were cooked to perfection, the garlic butter was great and the fried lobster was something I've never had before but will be on my list for the future. 
Next time I think I will try the crawfish meal. 

BTW, I wanted to take a picture of my food before eating it, but i was too hungry."}
{"text":"My first time trying Mr3s and I would say it was mediocre. The establishment itself is tiny and you can only order to go. There's a sign up that says all food is made to order so there will be a 20-30min wait. They have about 4 chairs in there to seat so I can only imagine when it's really busy because it only hot in there sitting waiting. The was a young boy not older than 13 at the register taking orders and he was very sweet and helpful. I ordered the Mr3s Seafood Platter with the crab cluster, jumbo shrimp, potatoes, corn and sausage and ordered a garlic egg on the side. The carb cluster was over cooked. The shrimp, sausage, and potatoes were all good. The corn was very tiny like I probably ate it in 2 bits. And the egg was cold, who wants a cold hard boiled egg? Not me! Oh I also wanted to try the seafood rice but they were out. All in all I will probably give them another try, just avoiding the crab cluster & egg. I did see the customer in front of me lobster tail & it looked really good."}
{"text":"Mom & I went for the first time 9/17/16. We split the lobster combo w/extra cluster. Generous portions for the buck. Service was great, everything cooked 2 order. We'll b back."}
