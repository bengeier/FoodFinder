{"text":"I experienced fast, friendly service and yummy pizza. Got a large pepporoni for two kids and myself and it filled us up. give it a shot."}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly and Fun, the only downside is the older women who seems to work the front occasionally, she has poor customer service, and argues with customers. Won't revise if she happens to her there. The gentlemen in the back are very friendly on every other visit there, good food, great personality."}
{"text":"Good pizza ...family likes it ! 2XL pizza's for aprx. $20"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.My favorate pizza joint neaby.We have been regulars since they first opened up.Always satisfied.They care for their customers,fresh food and delicious too.Friendly atmosphere every time you walk in.Their Lazagna and Ravioli Meet are the best.Try their salads too,always frieshly made.Thank you guys"}
{"text":"The pizza is okay, I still like Barro's better, but US pizza has some good wings. The delivery has bee fast and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"First time at this location, used to fo to the one of Cactus and 75th, and it was always great.  Tried this location and will not return.  Pizza is no where near the quality of the other location.  Their pizza was extremely greasy and their wings must have come off of some quail.  They are extremely small and not very much meat on them.  If you are in the area and want quality pizza and wings, head to NYPD, don't waste your time or money here!!"}
{"text":"Use to be good. Now it is not. Seems like ownership changed. Customer service is not as great. We ate there and did not feel welcomed (kinda like Benny's bagels in Surprise) when we walked in, there was a kid with long curly hair mopping. We ordered pizza. As we sat and waited, he was touching and pulling at his hair and goofing off with another employee. As the pizza was done I was hoping he would not put his hands on our pizza. He did. He was touching his gross hair and then cut our pizza. Mind you he had been mopping and touching other things. I would've thought there was a health code in which a hair net would be needed.   Then it seemed someone in the back decided to crack a door and smoke and the inside of the restaurant began to stink like cigarettes.   Anyway. No more business from our community to this place. We will continue get pizza from Marios Pizza on Dysart and Waddell."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings and the staff is awesome. my 4 year old said \"better than McDonald's\""}
{"text":"My whole family loved this pizza, especially the crust!  The restaurant was clean and the service was great and fast.  Everyone was very friendly.  My son keeps asking me when we are going back."}
{"text":"I like to let you know I had a yelp 5 dollar  off for this location.  I tried to use it and they did not honor it. Felt was trick ed but the pizza was ok.  But I will take my business elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"I am sorry to say that this was the worst italian food I and my family ever had! I ordered 4 Calzones and Calzones usually start with Pizza sauce and then you pick what you want in them,,, well I ordered a Sausage Calzone and it consisted of some sausage sprinkled in it and to my amazement that was it no sauce and no cheese no nothing! ! ! And my family members were the same! ! ! So dont throw away 60.00 Dollars on Calzones filled with nothing and a ruined evening for sure. The owner proceeded to call me and say sorry but that sorry was just that a sorry word because it sure didnt bring back my 60.00 Dollars. And a ruined dinner oh and yes a pretty good hit to my pocket book watching eveything go in the trash! ! ! I honestly wish there qas a NO! Star rating that I could pick."}
{"text":"Tried a large sausage pizza with my wife and I will never go back. Very bland and greasy and there was very little topping I do not prefer them."}
{"text":"I give this place a -10! I ordered two pizzas last night. They smell amazing. I get home and the pizza is burnt! I call them and the man who answered the phone knew exactly who I was, and said I knew those were burnt. He puts me on hold to speak to the manager then comes back on the phone and says his manager said I can bring he pizza back and she would give me a $5 credit for another pizza!!! The outrage, I asked to speak to her. I asked her how they would let me take the pizza home knowing they were burnt. She said they pizzas were not burnt but well done, wth! First and last time I will ever go there!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing pizza!!!!  We have definitely made this a everypay day!!!!!  My oldest daughter- who started hating pizza is in love with this place.  :) You can tell that the pizza dough is made in house daily.  The lunch special is too awesome to pass up :)"}
{"text":"Not only is the food amazing but the owners are equally as amazing. My husband loves their calzones and wings while I love their pizza. There has never been a time we were disappointed or unhappy, truly a great family owned pizza place."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great salads, good wings  Nice clean place with great food  Nice lunch specials too"}
{"text":"For starters, don't trust the horrible ratings that this place gets. My friend had been here once and told me to come so we both came in and ordered Meatlovers Calzones. Their system wasn't working but the older gentleman did his best to accommodate us and still give us good service despite the troubles with the computer. After about 5-10 minutes our calzones were ready and let me tell you it was amazing!! They were very warm and absolutely LOADED with nice cheese, meat. About midway through the meal I went up and asked the older gentleman if I could have a water cup. I was expecting a small cup of water but he gave me two cups and a pitcher of water to bring back to the table!! Now that is good customer service! You can tell they care what the customer thinks and how their experience goes. I can't speak to the rest of their menu because I've only had the calzone, but I will be coming back try more for sure!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place ever. They have the greatest cheese and crust imaginable."}
{"text":"Stopped in with the family for a pie.  Now I'm not too particular about pizza- I'm pretty much a pizza-whore and haven't met too many pizzas I didn't like.  But the pizza here is just awful.  There is no flavor.  Everything tastes as though it can from a can of generic toppings. The staff seemed preoccupied with something else other than the customers."}
{"text":"I probably won't go back since its a little pricey but the main reason is that when I came to this location with my kids,the staff wouldn't stop cussing when speaking to each other.I felt it was rude to not even try and hide it ,kept doing it right in front of us."}
{"text":"Been to 1 Brothers (3) times hoping it would get better.  It is in a great location for us, next to Frys and about 2 minutes from our house.    It's definitely average.  There is nothing special about the pizza or the wings.  Not bad, but nothing to look forward to.  The restaurant is clean, plenty of seating with tvs strategically located.  There has been a rude lady at the register/counter each time we've gone.  Not sure if that's \"just how she is,\" but we expect SOME kind of positive customer service.  She was talking on the phone (2) times we were there and waited to end her conversation before acknowledging us.    There has always been one guy in back cooking (in my experience) and he was also the one that brought our pizza out to us.  There is limited parking directly in front, but it is in the mini strip mall area at Prasada Frys Marketplace, so you can park close enough.  It's never crowded, but not a surprise, its not that good!  Would be \"ok\" if you want to \"fill the hole\" are in the mood for pizza to grab a couple slices, but definitely NOT what we look to for family pizza night out or even \"to go.\"  They don't offer delivery, but their pizza and service is average, so wouldn't ask for it anyway.  Such a shame, we TRIED to make it OUR PIZZA JOINT!  We go 10 minutes out of our way to pick up Lucky's Pizza......PERFECTION if you're looking for delicious, New York-style pizza with fresh ingredients.  (See my Lucky's review ;)"}
{"text":"Pretty good overall. Similar to NYPD pizza, but the crust isnt quite as good, its just not quite right. Sauce, cheese, toppings were all good. Generally a good example of a new york pie.  Only real downside is the price... Its a bit too expensive. Knock a couple bucks off and id be back more often."}
{"text":"Okay so first time I had their pizza I was waiting to get a hair trim next door and figured I'd grab a slice. There was no pizza ready so I had to sit there waiting for one slice of pizza which defeats the purpose calling it NY style. Soooo I get my slice and it was bland, hardly any sauce, and the crust was like cardboard. I usually go to Ray's Pizza, but because this place is so close I wanted to really like this place.   I thought that maybe it was just a bad slice and next time I'll get a pie. I order a pie and go pick it up in 15 mins as they told me to do. The pizza is siting on the counter just getting cold. When i got it home I had to throw it in the oven. Again, no flavor and very little sauce. I gave up on this place pizza wise. I can go to Ray's which is further away and my pizza is still hot when I get it home.   Anyway, while watching football I was craving some wings and thought eh why not. Maybe (fingers crossed) they have decent wings. So I order 12 wings. Now I should have sensed trouble when they handed me this tiny bag. So basically a burger size box had all the wings. Again, cold... The wings were so tiny and dry... I give up. I rather drive to Ray's or Lucky's."}
{"text":"3.1/5 Stars - Pizza is slightly above average if you consider pizza hut average. The best one on the menu is the meatball pizza. As for the comments regarding service my experience has been the complete opposite. I go in there once a month and the cashier has always been very nice to me."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood place. The pizzas are very large for the price, the calzones are amazing, and although the line is not great, they do offer a generous poor. Depending on who is at the cash register, you either get amazing service with a smile, or sour Susan. Great place for takeout pizza for the family"}
{"text":"The pizza and wings are real good, however the service and atmosphere makes it difficult to continue to go back, but I end up going back since the pizza is good.  Update December 2014... they are by far the worst in customer service. They wouldn't even take the yelp coupon."}
{"text":"We always try and support local restaurants. This is our first visit. We decided to try the calzones. We ordered the meat lovers and Hawaiian. My wife's calzone had pineapple on one half and the ham on the other. My calzone had a lot of pepperoni, sausage and ham throughout, but wasn't very hot. Overall the calzones didn't live up to our expectations. Not giving up quite yet on there food. Maybe next time we will try the pizza and wings."}
{"text":"First off, they don't even deliver! Wtf!! Pizza is hands down the worst in surprise. Ate there once and that was enough for us. Service was horrible. Dominos is way better"}
{"text":"Despite the reviews I decided to visit this place. I mean how bad can it be? I ordered two slices of pepperoni and I got two slices of cheese. When I brought to her attention she took the plate and then brought out two slices of pepperoni. No thanks for waiting no sorry just put it on the counter. I was the only one in there. It was an older man and older woman and I assume they were married since the we're arguing like husband and wife. The wife was watching TV picking her teeth with a toothpick sitting behind counter. I purposely walked out slowly and dumped my trash waiting to see if she would say Thanks for coming in! I got nothing. People in New York are nicer than these people. If you notice David J. writes reviews regularly and says good things. He must be an owner or friends with the owner since he always writes a review after several negative reviews. In fact if I recall he is the only one to write a positive review. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went there to support my local community establishment & decided to give #1 Brother Pizza.  I ordered the baked ziti I thought it was a complete meal to my dismay the salads are only available if you eat in . I felt shorted there's no reason they can't box a salad or offered me the antipasta salad. Nothing worse than dinner missing a salad.  Don't you think so.     As for the Ziti the noodle very soggy no meat in there just a complete disappointment. If your going to offer it make it a complete meal including a salad I could of ate it while waiting for my dinner. You also need to make garlic toast instead of sandwich roll. The sauce tasted like tomato paste bland & acid tang. Very disappointed. So the next day spoke to Al or Alex He hooked me up with the best Capstone ever Thank you very much.     Sincerely Von"}
{"text":"Gave this place another chance! Daughter said she likes their pizza at another location. Wife and I was on the go so we decided to stop off and get a slice each! Wife has not eaten here yet, so this is her first time. We both had a slice of pepperoni pizza and shared a large diet coke. I asked them to cook it well done so we can have that crispy crust. I do have to admit that it was a lot better this time. Sauce seem to have a better taste? It was very greasy! Wife does not like that, but I do!!!!!! Gave them an extra star!!!(horay!!!) Probably will come back again? Who knows, if we have another good experience maybe they will get another star?"}
{"text":"The place is nice and clean. We ordered 3 X-large pizza's to-go. Cheese, sausage, and pepperoni. All 3 pizzas were delicious! Each pizza had plenty of meats, cheese, and sauce. The crusts were the perfect combo of a lil chewy on the inside and a lil crunchy on the outside. They were also perfectly cooked. I don't know if this location is part of the other valley Brothers Pizza Restaurants but the pizza here is just as delicious as the other locations with this name. I will be back here when in the area and hope to dine-in. Sorry I don't have any pics because the pizza was gone fast!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and decided to try this place out. The prices were great for lunch specials, and dinner specials as well. I was amazed at how friendly the staff were and how comfortable they made us. We ordered an extra large pizza, 25 hot wings, a large antipasti salad, and fried zucchini.  And may I say... WOW. You won't be able to find food any better anywhere else along with the great prices. It was an enjoyable experience with the friendly customer service, my favorite sports game on the tv, and great food. Definitely a place I will be going back to."}
{"text":"Yummy! We love coming here. The food is made from scratch and is always fresh. Owner is awesome and very friendly. Pizza, fried mushrooms, and grilled chicken sandwhich."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza for pick up - the woman on the phone said she would hold my order 10 mins since i wouldn't be able to get there for 20 and i told her this - she said it will be ready in 20 mins. Pizza picked up, got home - pizza BARELY warm -- clearly she didn't hold it at all since when i asked how long for pizza she said 10 mins when I called. The wings....ALL wings were flappers - not 1 drumstick wing! And they were overcooked and soggy (which means they sat as well). I called and spoke to the woman I placed my order with and she told me the pizza came out of the oven 5 mins ago....NOT A CHANCE! And the I told her that all the wings were the flappers and 2 of the wings were actually just a bone...not even any meat on them! She told me that she made the wings and they are the same for every customer. Then she told me to bring the pizza back and she would make me a new one --- ummmm NO THANKS! I have a hungry family, its after 7pm, you already failed at the only thing you do and then you lied to me and the whole time you are yelling....that's ok - I would rather tell customers to beware of BAD PIZZA, WORSE WINGS and horrible cust service before they waste their time and money. Go to Federico's next door..."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and ordered the meatball sub and the hubby got the chicken parm sub... I'll come back to the food...first the service was great the young staff who loved his comics was the best. He was so fun and personable, he would be the reasons we would return. For the food, it was just meh. We bit into our sandwiches and literally it tasted like nothing. No salt not even really a saucy taste in there. It was a bummer because both sandwiches looked picture perfect; like get in my mouth kind of amazing, but no. We have had their pizza before so I would recommend sticking with their all meat pizza. It definitely tastes like pizza and is way better than the sandwich situation. Over all we are firm believers in supporting our small businesses, so I'm sure you can find something on the menu that tastes like something in the Italian food department."}
{"text":"This place sucks balls. I can't believe it is still open. I went here one day while I was installing a alarm system in a house around the area. Took them 45 min to bring out 2 slices of pizza by that point i was going to walk out the door.   blandest pizza i have ever tasted. i don't know how this place is still open. never again. horrible service, horrible food."}
{"text":"Not bad pizza, I like the twice cooked to add veggies for supreme, but they were a little too under cooked.  If the idea of reheated cheese pizza with the toppings you request added when reheating is ok with you, then you may like it.  I do like it, it makes the crust yummy, but you have to get the veggies soft a little...  The salad was good, pretty fresh, friendly customer service. I will be back when I need a single slice pizza fix, but if it is consistently like what I had, I may not keep going..."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place and their food. Def recommend! The calzones were yummy. We are regulars and have had no issues with our food."}
{"text":"This is my families new favorite spot.  We got to the point where we were ordering pizza once a week.  Their pizza is delicious and the wings are fantastic.  I love the small family owned business.  We will pick local over big business every single time because these people pour their heart into what they do.  The place is sometimes slow and sometimes busy but be patient if you go on a busy day there are only a few of them and they are working really hard."}
{"text":"Look. I've been going here since I was a teenager and the pizza is phenomenal. Ranch?! My favorite! My only issue is that getting a discount is iffy. Some employees know about it and others don't. Sure, 10% isn't going to break the bank and we are happy to support this place. But if you offer a discount, we are going to take advantage of it. Every. Single. Time.  This evening an older woman was working the front. When I arrived to pick up my order and ask for the discount we always receive, she asked for \"a purple card\", despite me presenting my military ID (weird, right?). She then stated \"it's only $14, I don't have a button for that anyway\" and charged me full price. Well, yes you do ma'am, because we have in fact, gotten that 10% off every time we have come in here. Self admittedly, I didn't challenge her on this too much, seeing as she couldn't recognize a military id staring her in the face.  At the end of the day, it is what it is. We will still eat here because it's my favorite pizza joint. Just the manner in which this was handled got under my skin and I hope that one day, everyone, both young and old, can operate the register and be equally aware of discounts/coupons and what buttons to push without creating such a fuss."}
{"text":"First time here, have had better!, have had worse! Really nothing special, was not that packed which is always a red flag!, the thing that i did not loke was, No red peppers or cheese containers at table, and plus the fact, no refills on drinks, you have to go up and ask including napkins!! Pizza took less then 10 min to make which is suspicious, tasted like frozen pizza to me!!"}
{"text":"EVERY PAY DAY EVERY SINGLE WEEK THIS IS DINNER!!!!!! We are regulars and have NO complaints!!! Love love love their food, their prices and their hospitality!!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was really good - the thin crust reminded me of Italian deep dish pizza.  My family loved it, we will definitely be back.  The people working were very nice too."}
{"text":"Crust was overcooked and only mediocre flavor. Won't eat again"}
{"text":"It's an okay place, but I have experienced better.  Not as good as some pizza joints I've been to like Alondra's in Los Angeles or even Grimaldi's Pizzaria in Peoria, but it's still pretty good.  However, the pizza is also very pricy; 40 dollars for two 16 inch pizzas is not exactly every week material, in comparison to generic joints like Pizza Hut or Domino's, and at the same time, I do not feel the quality is on par with other restaurants, like the two mentioned above.  That said, their lunch menu is quite cheap with a slice and soda for 4 bucks.    As for the store itself, I do not get a shop that feels like I should dine in.  It feels like a take out place due to the cheap furniture and terrible layout."}
{"text":"When I walked in the place was dead and I asked the guy behind the counter what he recommended. He pointed out a large pizza and 25 wing special for $23, so I got the thin pizza with pepperoni and the wings with bbq sauce to go. While I sat and waited for my pizza everyone who entered new the guy and he knew them and what they wanted. This is what you want in your neighborhood pizza place. Got the pizza home, I am not really a thin crust kind of person but thought I'd give it a shot, Not bad! The wings were small but they were cooked right and had plenty of flavor, and you get so many for the price, I guess size doesn't matter then. I at least grabbed a menu on my way out and plan on giving them a few more orders in the weeks to come, noticed they have different crusts and that they offer an assortment of sides. I may have to give a few future reviews on this place for new items I find or create from their menu."}
{"text":"Paid 18 bucks for a large pizza.  Waaay to much salt and was some of the greasiest pizza I have ever had in my life and I am 53yrs old.  Wife and I ate one piece and threw the rest of that crap away.  I should have been paying attention to the HUGE mound of raw chicken wings just sitting out behind the counter not covered.  I had to wait 15 minutes or so for the pizza and those wings just sat there the whole time.  Man at the counter was nice.  Young ladies working for him were nice.  Front of place appeared clean but those wings were a health code violation if I ever saw one.  Pizza was/is nasty.  The rest I cannot comment on.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great people. Always friendly and the food is great. Stop in and pick up a pizza or lunch specials. Everything is great here, calzones, pizza and salads."}
{"text":"The food was decent.  My friend and I had the meatball sub and marinara chicken sub.  I know this is stereotyping but being served food my real Italians I expected more spice and flavor in the food.  The alcohol selection is small but has the essentials (beer and wine). I want to go back and check out the pizzas before I write this place off."}
{"text":"I'll admit my first few visits nothing really stood out. Pizza and wings were good, but they have quickly became our go to place on our way home from work. Every time my husband comes in the owner already knows our usual order and always goes out of his way to make sure it's quick and perfect. I love, love, the anti pasta salad. The wings are awesome and the kids inhale them the second we open the box. The pizza feeds our entire family of 6 and there's never any left overs. The anti pasta salad Is a huge portion and I can save some for the next day or share with my family if I'm being nice . They have a great special with large pizza and 25 wings for $23."}
{"text":"I gave it the two stars because the manager was extremely kind. Very accommodating, even though I could tell he might have been a little overwhelmed. The pizza took a little longer to prepare than I would expect, and normally I would not mind as long as it was something outstanding. Unfortunately, this one was nothing special. If something lures me back in again and anything is different I will be certain to update my review, but there are just too many pizza places around here to find myself giving it another shot."}
{"text":"Was really craving pizza and I'm no expert but being from the east coast and first few jobs in a pizza kitchen, my standards are high. First off the location is great simple design and very well kept. The menu is simple but diverse and the pricing is very low in comparison to the quality of the food. These guys (and gal) really did a bang up job, I came in on the dinner rush and ordered two slices and fried mushrooms just the cashier two cooks and the owner floating about overseeing and helping the guys in the back. He came through the dining floor and offered me a beverage while I waited. Over the top customer service l, guys in the back never stopped hustling and the young lady in the front was courteous and polite. The food was extraordinary and the experience was great. Will be back"}
{"text":"Avoid this place. Home of cold pizza and over cooked chicken wings that are left to drowned in sauce to get soggy. Customer service is absolutely horrible! Good luck if you choose to try. Better off just getting Frys pizza next door"}
{"text":"IM AN EMPLOYEE AND MY BOSS SPAT IN MY FACE!!!!!!!!! I WAS an employee for #1 Brothers Pizza in Surprise. I just quit today. Gary, the son, nice man, everyone loves him! Reque, (I'm not sure how to spell it), sweet, quiet man, very lovely to be around and work with. Linda, older lady, very tough, and strict. These were my thoughts on my 3 bosses. The locations are run by a couple, and their son. Their son, Gary being my primary boss, as I work with him 3/5 days a week. Every employee has warned me about Linda, however and though she is a very disrespectful person, I knew my place, I stayed quiet and I did what she asked me to do. HOWEVER today upon walking into work, beginning my shift, Linda and I got into an argument, ending with her SPITTING ON MY FACE IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS AND MY COWORKER!!!! I QUIT ON SPOT AND CHARGES HAVE BEEN PRESSED! WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND THINKS IT IS OKAY TO SPIT ON THEIR EMPLOYEE!?"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving them a 1 star is because I can't give them a -5 star. We ordered 4 Italian subs and they got everyone wrong, we ordered garlic cheese bread which had no cheese didn't taste no garlic and was burnt on a bun not bread. DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY, BUY A FROZEN GARLIC LOAF AND FROZEN SUB."}
{"text":"This place is SO GOOD!! My kids are devouring the pizza and wings! I'm loving my pizza and salad! The Prices... WOW this is 40$ pizza for 7$!! I will be coming back for sure with all my friends and family!"}
{"text":"So, it's not the best pizza/sub I've ever had.... but it's one of the better in the area.  I am quite particular about an Italian sub.  My opinion is that if it typically comes with (or is printed on a menu with) MAYO, then it's not an Italian sub.  Italian dressing, oil & vinegar, etc = perfect!  The sandwich should be lightly cooked to allow the bread to be toasted, melt the cheese and warm the meat to bring out the juicy flavors.  My only suggestion would be to add the Italian dressing on the side of the bread so it'll be soaked in better, rather than running off the slick surface of the meat.  If you go for the thinner crust pizza then it should have a nice crisp texture, but not so overcooked that it slices up your mouth when you eat it.  This place does pretty well on both the sub and the pizza, although I would suggest that they be more consistent on how things are run.  One time the sub is cooked, next time it's not.  Most people return to a restaurant because there was something about their first experience that they enjoyed - hence they want that same experience again.  If there are inconsistencies too frequently then it disappointing.  Now, I'll admittedly state that I cannot vouch for the cleanliness of the store, or the behaviors of the staff as we typically call ahead and pickup for bringing home.  Bad customer service and cleanliness issues will make the best restaurant immediately be the worst.  So, if there are issues with either, it's in the best interest of the owner to be aware and remedy.  Consumers have lots of options nowadays - give them the best and they stay loyal."}
{"text":"One star for the kind girl at the register. I ordered a calzone and a salad. Got home and the salad is all brown and light yellow. No green at all. The calzone dough is not buttered or seasoned at all which makes for a plain doughy taste. The inside had literally only 4 pepperoni's and was loaded with some kind of white sauce. I am truly disappointed since I convinced my husband to try them. This food is honestly disgusting. I was really hoping for a tasty meal. Maybe the pizza is better than all the other stuff. Unfortunately we will not take another risk here."}
{"text":"Jersey girl.  Jersey pizza.   We're regulars here and have had an issue ONCE in the years we've been going here and that was resolved immediately.  Pizza is good, reasonably priced and way less processed than Pizza Hut, Dominos and the like.  Will continue to come here as long as the pizza continues to be hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"A great pizza starts with a great crust. #1 Brothers has their crust recipe nailed down. It has a bit of a crisp on the exterior and a nice chewy interior. It is the perfect crust. This is my favorite pizza place in Surprise. The wings are good and they are cheaper than just about anyone else. The man that runs the place is very nice. The staff has always been courteous as well.  #1 Brothers is #1 in my book!"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was the price.  The value is good...but you get what you pay for.  The pizza was greasy and the sauce had no flavor.  The wings had hardly any meat on them.  My 5 year old only ate one piece and then said that his tummy hurt.  He usually eats at least 4 pieces of pizza!  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Delicious! My husband and I were born and raised in New Jersey which has tons of pizza, very similar to the New York style. This place is the closest thing we've found to pizza from home. I was not expecting much since lots of places claim to be \"New York pizza\" but normally fall short. The pizza was so delicious. Perfectly crispy crust with just the right amount of grease on top. I ordered takeout and my pizza was still hot and fresh by the time I got home. The two gentlemen working when I picked it up were extremely friendly. My only negative is that I wish they delivered! I will definitely be eating there again!"}
{"text":"i ordered a large italian sub and a large sicilian special, both were coated in black on the crust.....clean your ovens......the sub may just have been the worst i have ever ate....subway is better ( if that means good : ( ) the pizza itself was just ok.....the staff was nice but unfortunatley that's not enough to take me back again"}
{"text":"It was nice to have a pizza place so close to home buttttt. I gave this place multiple chances.   It wasn't that the food was bad, it seemed to always come out rt. Not my favorite but worth eating since it was convenient. The reason for one star was the inability to get back proper change. Maybe its just me that usually puts to much trust into the cashier to give the right change back. But i dont think so. The first two times it was a few dollars, oh well maybe it was my mistake...rt? Then the third time I orderd some pastas and an iced tea over the phone. I get there and the iced tea (which they didn't actually even sell) wasn't iced tea at all. It was bottled. With my total being 23 dollars I had handed the cashier two twentys. After the tea discovery I decided I didn't need it and it was taken off. I was back to $19 and change. She proceeded to hand me back change for one of the twentys, and I guess kept the other twenty as a tip! Unfortunately I didn't realize this till I got home. I pulled the few pennies out of my pocket and knewI I had been taken by this place once more. I refuse to go back and that's the last $20 that place will see from my pocket."}
