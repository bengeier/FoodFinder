{"text":"\"In cod we trust\" great deep fried fish toco (but fish portion is small) 

\"Beef Cheek\" braised and good portion 

Tuna Chive in hard shell toco okay portion ( a little too drenched in sauce) 


We had some ribs \"special of the day\" portion not worth the price AT ALL ... Sauce is a type of honey garlic (drenched in mayo ) not worth the money. 

 I had high hopes for great food here after reading the reviews ...but was over all not really that impressed."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice, more than once was a mistake.  When they were a street operation, albeit a semi-legal one, it was really cool, novel - people would line up for days.  The tacos were $3 apiece, and it was a unique and fun experience. 

Ever since they got fixed locations though, I am very unimpressed.  I have slight hearing loss and the environment in this place is not conducive to any form of conversation - the music is all rap and hip hop and seriously and intensely loud.  I don't mind the style of music at all and am happy to eat tacos to A Tribe Called Quest, but at airplane-taking-off decibel levels? I was with a group and couldn't hear a word of what was being said, made me feel stupid and isolated.  Asking for music to be turned down was disregarded - 'this is our brand' was what I got in return.  Gross.  Service was slow and weirdly pretentious given the aesthetic they are trying to cultivate.

As per the tacos - overpriced and way small.  No lies, the cod fish is a decent two bites, but the carnita, cotija and beef cheek taste very boring - like more boring than ground beef with a 99 cent taco mix packet boring.  You could eat ten of them easily and still be hungry, which sets you back over $60 - the price/food ratio is rough and both times I left hungry, poorer, and disappointed.

The cherry on top is that this place is run by misogynists who think it is funny to make taco puns at the expense of women.  They have done this multiple times, and I am certain will continue to do so despite overtures to the public.  But hey, it's just locker room talk, right? 

On food quality, ambiance, and price, there are many, many better options for tacos in Toronto - I would skip this one."}
{"text":"Attentive service and good food! Had the Mexican corn and tortilla with 3 dips for apps.  Guacamole was good - other two dips - the corn salsa and spicy bean and smoked queso was meh. Mexican corn was really good. The sauce and spices were yummy!

I had the cod tacos and the Crispy Cotija. Cod taco was good. Cotija not so much.  

I was too stuffed to eat a whole dessert myself so I shared the churros. I didn't enjoy these at all. I much have rather had one of the Sweet Jesus popsicles that my other dinner guests had. 

Overall it was good. Next time I'll know to get less tacos or apps and save room for dessert."}

{"text":"La Carnita was a place that I recommended to all of my friends. Since the summer it had been serving, finally!, some good simple tacos in a comfortable easy going space.
We were there this weekend and unfortunately it, cynically, has dropped to the standards of its clientele.  It's crowded all the time so why bother making the effort?
The margueritas were tasteless, the fish taco was overdone and overbattered. The chorizo was greasy.  The corn was tough and unappealing.  Very disappointing. 
It's a real shame. La Esquina in NYC and its take out Corner has been in business for 7 years and still puts out a great taco and an excellent marguerita. There are all kinds of people there, lots who don't care but I feel that they get that there are enough that do and that its important to keep things on the up and up. 
So sadly I would say the promise of a great taco joint in TO is still unfulfilled. 
Please someone pick up the slack."}
{"text":"Attended this location as part of birthday celebration of 10. We were warned that the reservation was for 2 hours and that separate checks were not available. All good.

We were seated at a table with long benches - the seating in this restaurant is not comfortable so you won't want to stay longer. A smell reminiscent of a dead body was wafting out from under a closet door near our table. Our server, a very nice guy, was used to it, i suppose, because he didn't acknowledge the presence of the odour when asked.

In general the food was ok and the drinks were passable. If you are under the age of 30 and you don't mind shouting this place is for you. If you think that a can of corona dipped in salt is a cool drink idea then this is the place for you. If you've ever had really good tacos then this place is just too damn easy to avoid."}
{"text":"I ate here on April 12th with my girlfriend. The food is delicious, but the serving size is a bit on the small size and some of the food is overpriced for the portions you get. As for the food, I especially loved the street corn, Mexican meat balls and the corn salsa. 

The ambience of La Carnita is very loud (think club environment) with a hipster staff. As I observed the scene, I noticed one particular bar tender texting while working, then going back to pouring drinks. Maybe it's me, but I don't think texting while you work is cool, especially if customers can see you doing it in plain sight. At the very least, turn a corner where customers can't see you and text away. It just seems very unprofessional to me. 

When I first walked in, the bar is right there and I got a club vibe more than a restaurant vibe. Very loud Hip Hop music was played in the background (almost deafening to be honest). If you're expecting a quiet evening, think again, no seriously, think again. This restaurant seems to attract a \"younger\" crowd, for lack of a better word.

I enjoyed La Carnita until I decided to order \"dessert to go,\" which was churro's. The waiter informed me that, \"They don't do leftovers.\" I decided to order the churro's right then and there, since \"they don't do leftovers.\" 

My gripe with La Carnita is that they have huge competition with a population of over 2.8+ million people in the Toronto area. You're in the service industry, which means you should accommodate your customers to the best of your ability. With an attitude like, \"We don't do leftovers,\" I just rolled my eyes in my head and said to myself and whispered to my girlfriend, \"You don't do leftovers? Then I don't do tips.\" My evening was fine, until I heard that. Perhaps, I'm not the \"right\" customer they want. Whatever the case may be, they've definitely turned me off from even thinking about going back. 

When you're in the service industry and you start hearing, \"We don't do this, we can't this....\" and the request is within reason, which I believe in this case it was, then I doubt you're going to be in business very long. The whole situation literally went from a positive to a negative, just like that. In turn, the vibe of the waiter, rubbed off on me and all of sudden I couldn't tip. Imagine that."}
{"text":"Love the decor and style. Tacos are delicious albeit a bit small in portion size. I love all the taco selections but the chicken cutlet and fried fish one were average."}
{"text":"Terrible service and the food is very mediocre for the prices, would not recommend. The ridiculously loud music also makes it nearly impossible to talk to your friends."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food is delicious, atmosphere is loud but not bad so you can still hear people. Originally said 2 hours wait but it was less than an hour before we got a call. The carnita tacos were amazing and also the pork belly special. Don't forget to get the street corn, it's great!"}
{"text":"Visited this place during a trip to Toronto. Had the In Cod we trust fish taco, the grilled corn on the cob and the churros along with some tamarind soda. Great food, good prices. Happy camper. Definitely coming back on my next trip."}
{"text":"If you're into Mexican cuisine I would definitely suggest coming here and trying out LA CARNITA. 
The music selection they had playing the night I went, was on point and the Caesar's were going down like water.  Nothing special about them though, just your plain old regular cocktail.
Now to the food!!!  I started off with the Scallop Ceviche which was served with fried plantain (banana).  This appetizer was absolutely AMAZING!!!  The Scallops were tender and the avocado and sunflower seeds added a nice texture to the Ceviche.  My friend and I also shared the Mexican street corn,  BOMB.COM!!!!!  Never have I ever had corn on the cob like this; the mix of flavors after every bite of this is like a a CRAZYYYYY party in your mouth!!  I would definitely come back juat for the corn.
Than I had two of there \"In Cod we Trust\" tacos.  The tacos are straight up AWESOME.  The piece of fish in the taco was a very generous size and the coleslaw o top was tangy and really went well with the fish.
This is my second time coming to LA Carnita, first time here at the John St. Location.  I would suggest going to there College St. location as I believe there food there is done a little bit better.
CHEERS!!"}
{"text":"I've never given a Yelp review but felt I had to after my visit.  I HATE cilantro.  HATE it but absolutely love Mexican food.  I noticed that certain items on the menu had cilantro in their descriptions so I was planning on opting for the tacos that did not have any in it but the server told me that every taco had cilantro and due to their \"no mods\" policy, I couldn't ask for it not to be added.  I understand not being able to take it out of a sauce but it's absolutely ridiculous to refuse to not put it on as garnish.  I mean, come on!  Stop being so pretentious.  Cilantro is one of those flavours that some people have a serious aversion to and if you are going to make that ridiculous rule then please put some tacos on that don't have that repulsive ingredient in them!  For this reason, I won't return.  Sorry but if you are going to charge that much for your food then I'd like it to be food that I can truly enjoy without having to pick out an ingredient that I detest."}
{"text":"We had been looking forward to a decent meal with friends and kids.  We were late for our 5 pm reservation - but entered when the restaurant was not even 1/3rd full.  The snooty host told us \"we had an hour\".  The restaurant apparently takes only 2 reservations for parties of 8 at each of 5, 7 and 9 pm.  At 6:50 our friends asked for a drink and were told we can give it to you but you have to drink it by 7:10 - even though there were two other tables of 8 available for the two 7 pm reservations.  There was also a significant number of people who walked in after us and received no time pressure from the staff.  Manager apologized and suggested we'd see better service next time.  Don't think there will be a next time."}
{"text":"Really interesting menu that keeps it simple but refreshing
Good service and great location
Well worth a visit"}
{"text":"Stylish and fun place, fast and pleasant service and delicious food. 
I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I hold restaurants at a very high standard (because I know I can make myself a delicious meal at home just as easily and for way less money), so I never rave about a place unless it's amazing. La Carnita is amazing! 
For the same price as a crappy pub dinner, you can get three awesome tacos and a pint of local craft beer. There is bound to be a wait when you walk into the restaurant, but you can go have a pint somewhere nearby and they'll call you when your table is ready. They have no problem holding your table while you settle up at the other business and walk back to the restaurant. 

Two nights ago I had dinner at the new East End location of La Carnita, and I was blown away. I ordered the Mexican street corn as an appetizer, then had the Tostada de Ceviche (tuna ceviche, cilantro, and guacamole on a crispy tortilla), the Carnita taco (slow cooked pork and mango chutney), and my favourite, the Pollos Frito (fried chicken with pico de gallo and a peanut mole sauce). All three were so good I couldn't stop thinking about them. 
So the next day I took four friends to the West End location and ate the same three tacos again, this time with the tortilla chips and guacamole as an appetizer. Bam!

These are hands down the best tacos I've had in Toronto. Go eat there. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"I do like their tacos but it's not consistent - sometimes it's really good other times it's dry and tasteless. Of all the tacos the battered fish is the best. The service however has gone terribly gone, which explains the really low rating. I came here on the evening (about 8ish) on Feb.4th and the two hostesses at the front were dreadful. We were two people and there was an empty table that sat 2:2 and they told us it was reserved, 5 min later they seated a group that dropped in (I know because i overheard the convo)."}
{"text":"I have been to La Carnita a few times now and finally decided that it's time to contribute a review. 

Expect to wait a while before you get a table. Every time I've come here, we started with a few drinks at the bar. Because the line up is so long, we usually down about five drinks more than we expect and give in and just have dinner at the bar. This is a plus as the bartenders are pretty good. 

Speaking of drinks, they have a good selection of the usual hipster craft beers as well as OE in a paper bag. It goes down well with the 90s hip hop. 

The tacos do not disappoint. I've tried most of them. Three is usually enough for someone with an appetite. I recommend the fish one, but it's not like you'll be upset with the others. The corn was pretty good, but don't order it if you're on a date or else you'll be surreptitiously trying to remove corn from your teeth for the remainder of the date. 

Finish dinner off with a few more drinks. By then you're probably drunk. That's when you need to order the Churros. I can probably eat 10 of those. And then drink whatever they're dipped in."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now and food was excellent each time! Easy to miss driving by and sometimes takes a while to get in, especially if you are in a group, but the staff are friendly and the music/atmosphere is fun and a great place to chill after a long day. I have tried the mexican street corn, and the fish/beef cheek/chicken/ceviche tacos, all of which were a flavour explosion! Very fresh and interesting ingredients. Just enough spice to not be overwhelming. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went here on Monday Dec 12 for my birthday after a friend recommended it and it completely ruined my birthday. First off it was so loud that my wife and I couldn't hear each other, secondly the lighting was so low we couldn't read the menu. The wait staff come to the table then run back to congregate in the corner and converse. The food was a complete let down. We ordered the Miami ribs for a starter and they were like warm and tough, the fish tacos were ok but nothing to write home about at $6 each, and lastly we ordered the carne asada which states on the menu that it's for two..LOL what a joke. As there is no explanation on the menu I figured \"for two\" meant that it was some carne asada with a couple of flat breads and we could make a couple tacos..wrong!! It was a piece of steak half an inch thick with some onions or somethings fried on top and maybe 4oz at most for $21. We left hungry and disappointed. My wife had suggested the keg and I should've listened, worst birthday dinner experience ever. Thanks for the memories I'll never forget. Take my advice and stay away. The friend who recommended the place told me today that since branching out the service and food have suffered"}
{"text":"Three people. Saturday night.

Nice decor. 
A few people waiting ahead of us, the hostess told us it would take at most 15 mins (she looked confused and she was not sure how to use the system).
We waited until there was no one waiting except us. Then this couple comes in and they get seated right away. The hostess tells us she's going to see something upstairs. A few minutes after, the second hostess tells us to go upstairs - where we wait another good five minutes while the waitresses are deciding \"oh these people are going to pay soon\", \"these two look like they are leaving\". I could already feel a negative, unprofessional vibe. The hostess then tells us to sit at the bar for another 10 minutes while we wait for our table. Finally got a table for two with an extra chair.
The waitresses aren't the nicest nor the most knowledgeable. 
We ordered their Friday special: they were sold out. So we got the Tostada De Ceviche (5/5) and the in Cod We Trust (4/5).
When we finished, they \"suddenly\" had more of the Friday specials so we ordered that. It was not worth it and took away from the good two tacos I had earlier.
The bill was thrown at us as soon as we finished eating. She didn't even ask if we wanted dessert!
They have those paranoia washrooms: the individual ones that opens up to the restaurant. They creep me out and it's quite un-hygienic. 

Bottom line: Good food. Horrible service and management. Quite expensive. Not worth the experience. I would rather pay this much for a nicer experience."}
{"text":"This was some of the best Mexican food I've had in Toronto. The tacos were served like tapas so you could try more than one kind. The cod tacos were definitely the highlight of the meal but the pork belly and mole chicken tacos were a very close second. The atmosphere was upbeat and lively and our waiter was really great and attentive. It was a great experience and we will definitely come back to try the items we were too stuffed to try this time!"}
{"text":"Food ***** - Service **** - Ambience ****

I am a big fan of their tacos. Their chicken, Cod and veggie taco are ungodly delicious. I have been to their Queen east, John Street and College Street locations, they are all just amazing. 

Their mexican sweet corn on a cob is sooooooooooo gooooooood !!!

Strongly recommended"}
{"text":"Easily one of the best Tacos I have eaten. Very different from the traditional ones and very satisfying. A bit too pricey I felt. But this has become our return to place."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for the longest time and I finally had the chance to!! Great place to hang and eat after a long day of work. The ambiance is fantastic and I love their playlist! 

Mexican Street Corn - o.m.g BEST CORN EVER. Why didn't I come here sooner? Grilled to perfection, the cheesy sauce topped with spice is just heaven in my mouth. We had to order another one because it was THAT good. 

In Cod We Trust - Not a big fish fan but everyone seems to love fish tacos so I decided to try it. The cod was so moist and the batter was very crunchy. I wasn't a big fan of the pickled red cabbage, there was too much on it that I had to remove it. None the less it was good but not something I would get again.

Pollo Frito - Delicious crunchy fried chicken put into a taco. This was my absolute favorite!! The portion was big and the peanut mole sauce was to die for.

Beef Cheek - Juicy beef cheek that dripped all over my plate. But the spice definitely hits the right spot. 

Sangria - Got the pitcher for $55, not the best. It was 70% ice and 30% sangria. Ontop, the servers filled our glass with more ice so we had a pretty watered down sangria. 

Would recommend others to try this place and I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Pros: Tacos are are delicious, full of flavour and affordable. Drinks are tasty as well. The place has a cool/casual/hip vibe although be wary that it can get very loud at times. Menu is simple although everything I've had has been good.

Cons: I've never found the service all that attentive or friendly. In my last outing to the restaurant, our server was definitely on the pretentious side and didn't seem concerned at all if we were enjoying the food or the experience. It felt like it was a major inconvenience for her every time we wanted to order another drink."}
{"text":"I have to say that La Carnita's reminded me of my visit to Grand Electric. Their vibe, menu and service is quite similar. Slightly more expensive than GE.

The fish tacos were delicious. But their guac was lacking freshness."}
{"text":"I love this place for a fun and laid back dining experience. Although small, the menu has a decent variety for different tastes and everything I have tried is delicious. The bartender is awesome and the drinks are perfect every time. I find the corn on the cob to be a bit overdone and too messy, but all of the tacos are always cooked and seasoned to perfection and the guacamole is amazing!"}
{"text":"IN COD WE BUST
I am very disappointed in the people/sheep of Toronto who think the tacos here are anything above mediocre slop.  Now to start off i ordered the famous in cod we trust and trust me it tasted like bad fish and chips wrapped in a tortilla.  I am sorry but whomever is the bartender or creator of the drinks needs to wake up,  Margarita needs fresh lime juice salted rim cointreau and tequila and some agave syrup.  Our margaritas tasted like agave syrup a drip of lime and some water really, not sure where the tequila ended up.  Mango salad was good, but who the hell cares, you want salad, go to fresh.

Service
Waitress was very nice took our drink order, came back 5 mins later took food order.
15 mins passed and we finally received our green something in a glass  All three of us took about 2 sips of our green concoction then our food arrived.  We set aside our drinks to one side of the table to show the waitstaff that we weren't very happy, assuming that the service was good we thought someone would come over and say \"hows your food, ru enjoying, may i get you anything else\".  But no, nothing, nothing for 20 mins, finally she came back and we said we don't like our drinks taste like sugar water.  If i needed saline i would go to the hospital give me some tequila!
Then i guess the mixologist arrived at our table saying\"the waitress said you would like a suggestion on what to drink\"  we replied \"no we just thought the margaritas were extremely sweet\" he replied \"that's how we make them\"  \"we said that's nice make us something with bourbon then\" he then thinking that we were born in a cave replied\"how about three bourbon sours\" we said \"great\"  then he actually wanted to explain a bourbon sour to us.  I am not sure if this is indicative of the tastes and expectations of their client base or him being condescending.  Anyway THATS ALL!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, decent food, but not great. I think most of it is hype. I always leave satisfied but never have my mind blown. I recommend getting the street corn to start."}
{"text":"Quick review:

Food:
Delicious. Small plates, need to order a few per person.
Atmosphere:
Small restaurant and you have to wait for a table (last time it took 1.5hours). Vibrant and packed place.
Service:
Really friendly waiters and bartenders - attentive and actually engage in conversation with the diners! Busy restaurant but I never felt rushed to order and leave the table!

Overall: I've been there five times and I absolutely loved it: service was great and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"I was let down by La Carnita, despite the convenience of not having to trek all the way to downtown for good Mexican eats.  

The service was not very efficient.  Throughout the evening we struggled to grab the waitress' attention from ordering our food to paying the bill.   The food on the other hand was decent but not the best Mexican food especially for the prices we paid.  We were recommended the tortilla chips with dip to start.  The chips were crunchy and hot when they came out, the guacamole was creamy,  however we found ourselves frugally portioning the last bits of the dip since we still had many chips left over to go through.  

Then we were suggested to order three tacos each - which according to our waiter, should be more than enough for dinner. We had the 'In Cod We Trust'- which was one of the better tacos, the Beef Cheeks, the Tostada de Ceviche, Carnita  and the Pork Belly.   The Carnita was our least favourite (interesting considering the restaurant is named after it!) since we felt the pork was a bit tough and the flavours being lackluster.  However, either my friend and I were just two very gluttonous individuals that evening but we were still hungry after eating everything and had to order another taco each AND pay a visit to the Formocha bubble tea shop across the street afterwards (since the Sweet Jesus line was ridiculously long).   

Since my friend and I were also catching up-  the loud music combined with numerous customers trying to talk over the noise made it impossible to carry a conversation.  
That being said I came here in August when they first opened but after that experience, I think I will stick with going downtown for my Mexican food fix instead."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE La Carnita! Amazing tacos, great atmosphere.

Went for the first time a few weeks ago with a couple of girlfriends; it was so good I couldn't stop thinking of the food so took my hubby a few days later. I like the ambiance, decor has an underground feel (concrete, metal tables, graffiti art). 

Had guac and chips to munch on (it was OK). The margaritas on the rocks are great. But the piece de resistance are the tacos. Love the Beef Cheek, Tostado de Ceviche, and In Cod we Trust.

Tried the Churros for dessert, must try the Paletas next time.

So recommend this place!! Definitely one of my new faves."}
{"text":"Yummy tacos!! Be prepared to wait, but not as long as Grand Electric.  Stick with the tacos, they are delicious.  Great addition to the neighbourhood.  Very exciting."}
{"text":"I love all of the tacos, dips, corn, and appetizers- interesting flavour combinations, tacos are large and fresh. Great atmosphere, locations and servers are excellent. Best tacos in the city. I would recommend this place over El Catrin or Grand Electric."}
{"text":"This is my go-to taco place. It's got consistent flavours and their fried haddock taco as well as their ceviche taco are my favs. They have a daily special. The chorizo is so good. Their margarita is super tasty too! Their staff is a bit sassy but I don't really mind it. It's a chill place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere , nice staff, I had the guacamole and corn for starters. They were both great but the corn was fucking phenomenal!!! It's a must!! My mains were the cod,chorizo,chicken and fried avocado taco. The cod and chicken were good but the fried avocado was the best, as for the chorizo , don't bother. It tasted like sugar and the flavours in general were just off."}
{"text":"Service is great atmosphere is very cool and most importantly food is fantastic really love the chips and guacamole and corn"}
{"text":"Expensive drinks and food wasn't that good. Tacos are small and not tasty, but the guacamole and chips were okay. If you're looking for tacos there are many other places!"}
{"text":"Mixed review... went here for the first time today after hearing decent things. Our food and the drinks were good. Service was fair when we first showed up, but after a while, our group was moved to a tiny table so the restaurant could accommodate a larger group using our previous table. Once we were moved it was like we didn't exist anymore, despite the fact that we were up to almost $300 on our bill for a group that ordered multiple meals and drinks. Our server was nowhere to be found for over 20 mins after we ordered the most recent round of drinks. When we finally flagged him down and mentioned we had been waiting for a long time, we were confronted with attitude and told it had only been \"8 minutes\". It hadn't... There were no apologies or accommodations made, rather we received attitude  and then we continued to wait for our order. That was our last round since we were disappointed with the service. We left and went to another bar. This was a week night so it wasn't even particularly busy. Don't plan to return after that experience."}
{"text":"Meh. This is a let down compared to the two times i've been to La Carnita on Queen Street E. The food there was amazing, great quality and fresh. When I entered, the music was loud, the host was nowhere to be found. The tables were too small for two people if you had more than 2 plates theres no space. The music is way too loud and the place is too dark to even see what you are eating. The server was nearly impossible to get a hold of to even order food, drinks or even get the bill. The food wasn't great. I thought it would be the same as the downtown location, but the food quality and food at Yonge&Eglinton is terrible. It taste completely different and is even pricier. Wouldn't come here again, would not recommend."}
{"text":"We visited here on the weekend on the recommendation of my son and his girlfriend who had been to another location. 

They have a great drink list with daily specials

The first thing we had was the tortilla chips with dips. The dips included guacamole (good), a spicy bean dip (very good) and a corn salsa dip (tres bien). We had the Avocado Mango Salad and the Mexican Street Corn which was very good with a Mexican Crema and a spicy ancho chili powder. If you like corn on the cob and have never had Mexican corn on the cob this is a good start.

The tacos we enjoyed included the \"In Cod We Trust\" with a deep fried piece of cod (very good), the \"Tostada de Ceviche\" with an albacore tuna (who doesn't love a good ceviche?), the Beef Cheeks (my fave) and the Pollo Loco (special of the day, very good)

We chose to forego the restaurant desserts as right next door (attached by an internal door) was their sister restaurant Sweet Jesus that serves up some special soft ice cream dishes. Save room for these.  

Note - They have a lunch special with 1 dip, 2 tacos and a dessert for $15. If you are eating alone or maybe with one other this is a great option.

Comments/Complaints/Suggestions

Food/Drinks - very good, a definite come again
Service - we had a wonderful server who went out of her way to make sure we were having a good time and taken care of.
Ambience - change up the music and lose the Kanye (Uh Huh Honey). There are songs that I don't need to ever hear again and that is one of them

a good restaurant, good staff and a definite return again"}
{"text":"In my opinion...I believe this restaurant is far too hyped up and over-priced for what you actually receive. 

I went there for a friend's birthday and we were told that we wouldn't be seated unless everyone was there. We were still seated even though the entire party wasn't there on time - so thank you for causing some people stress for no reason at all.

The service was puuussshy. I am not a fan of people constantly yammering on about what we should have/have to try/etc etc. It's very obvious that she was trying to up sell which made me uncomfortable. 

Our waitress suggested pitchers of margaritas which we agreed to thinking it was the cheaper way for a bigger group of people. They ended up being $50 each and were bitter at best. 

One person at the table asked for cilantro to be omitted from his tacos. Understandable, not everyone likes the taste! The waitress told us that the restaurant \"Doesn't change the menu at all\" but that we could \"pick it out if we wanted\". Yes, because picking out cilantro from a taco is that easy to do. 

Tacos were small, and I wasn't really wowed by the flavour. I couldn't taste the tuna in my tuna taco (it was overwhelmed by avocados) and the crunchy avocado taco was bland.  The best taco of the bunch was the crispy chicken. 

The desserts are rather delicious and I would not mind trying one of their popsicles (cookies and cream, waffles and syrup, key lime pie flavours). 

The worst was that the entire meal felt rushed as the waitress was constantly in our faces taking plates away. She took our appetizer away which still had nachos and dips on it, and then asked \"Oh would anyone like the last chips?\" How about you ASK if we're finished BEFORE taking it away. And of course, we were kicked out at the end saying \"The next guests are here\"...thank you for making me feel welcomed. 

Overall, I spent far too much money and still left the restaurant STARVING. I will most likely never return here again."}
{"text":"I have been here at least 10 times but finally got time to do a review.

Having been here so many times I have now tried all the tacos, and most of the specials of the week.

Top 3 tacos:
- in cod we trust
- pollo fritto
- beef cheek

All cooked perfectly and topped with beautiful garnishes.


Best special of the week:
- ribs on Sundays

My boyfriend and I will make a trip to La Carnita on Sundays just for these bad boys. They are topped with hickory sticks and are perfect with a pint of beer."}
{"text":"Heaven help you if you have a corn allergy and want to hang out with friends at La Carnita. The service was slow, and incredibly inflexible. Literally the only item on the menu I could eat is the mango salad, and even with that it was a few chunks of mango and half an avocado uncut. I asked for a minor substitution with the tacos- using a leaf of lettuce instead of the taco, and I was willing to pay extra. No go. Nothing I suggested, which would not cost the restaurant anything extra except for a few seconds of time, was agreed to. Don't bother with this place. The customer doesn't matter here."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. 

While the food was decent, its incredibly over-priced for what it is. 

The \"In Cod we Trust\" taco was over-battered and had an almost sickly sweet taste to it. Lengua was pretty good, churros were tasty.

The prices: 4.75 per taco (I could have eaten 6 of them easily) and outrageous beer prices. Small can of Tecate for 5.75? Craziness- tall boys of Tecate cost 1.95 at the LCBO.

Food isn't as good as Grand Electric and is more expensive. Won't go back"}
{"text":"Came where with a few people on a Wednesday. I found the server to be really friendly and she was happy to go at our slower pace with regards to ordering as we waited for a few more people to trickle in. I tried the pork taco and O.G. The O.G. was alright, and admittedly not something I would typically order so no fault of the establishment. The pork taco was tasty, but mostly because of the toppinhs. I also tried a couple bites of the street corn, and we ordered guac and chips for the the table. Everything was quite tasty and reminded me of Tacofino in Vancouver. The big drawback was the cost of drinks. I'm new to Toronto and adjusting to the prices, but $12.5 for a margarita? It is cramped, as others have said. However, the atmosphere was good, and if invited I would come back here or try one of their other locations."}
{"text":"The only way you will find the entrance to La Carnita is if you recognize the skull \"made up of taco ingredients\" (according to the restaurant's website). Or you could squint at the window to try and read the name of the restaurant that is scribbled on the Toronto Public Health sign...like I did. ;)

My friend and I arrived at around 5:30 on a weeknight and we were kindly seated right away. We got to sit by the window, which is the perfect spot for people-watching while enjoying a relaxing meal. The restaurant has a laid-back, hipster vibe in the decor, as well as the service. 

We ordered two starters, two tacos, and two paletas. The presentation of each and every dish was lovely.

Green Apple Scallop Ceviche served with fried plaintains (one of the specials of the day) -- it was a mixture of scallops, cilantro, chopped green apples and red peppers over guacamole, and topped with pumpkin seeds. The tanginess from the green apple bits was an interesting addition to this dish, but I felt the cilantro was quite overpowering (I am biased though because I do not like cilantro, parsley, celery, and the like). 

Mexican Street Corn -- a messy eat, but it was the BEST corn-on-the-cob I've ever had. I have tried spreading butter and sprinkling chilli powder on a grilled corn-on-the-cob, but sour cream, chilli powder AND cheese? Sweet, creamy, spicy, AND cheesy? Mmm...it was very tasty!

Beef Cheek Taco -- La Carnita's tacos are small (like everywhere else), but this was a very packed taco. Nothing in the taco really stood out though, other than the pickled jalapeño slices. 

Tostada de Ceviche with Albacore Tuna -- mmm...fried tacos are always good when they are light and crispy. It was covered in chopped fish, veggies, and guacamole. I think this is now one of my favourite tacos because I love ceviche and I love guacamole.

Key Lime Pie Paleta -- this was full of lime flavour, so it was very tangy. The added coating of crushed graham crackers was nice though.

Strawberry Shortcake Paleta -- the individual who thought of putting cake inside a popsicle is a genius! I enjoyed every bite, especially the ones filled with vanilla cake. It is one of the most interesting popsicles out there... (Apparently, a shop named Sweet Jesus -- affiliated with La Carnita, I believe -- will be offering these delicious paletas and it will soon open at John & Adelaide.)

I would definitely come back to La Carnita for the corn, the fried taco, and the paletas. I hope the Strawberry Shortcake flavour will remain available until then!"}
{"text":"I was seriously underwhelmed by this place, as were all the people in our party.

I'll start with the good: very quick, attentive service!! We were there on a Saturday night around 6:30, and we were in and out in 45 minutes. 

The bad: super mediocre food. Overpriced. Ridiculously loud.

This is Toronto. We have some of the best food from all nations here. There's no excuse for bland food. Especially if you're working with Mexican.

Each taco, which is an authentic size (read: small), is anywhere from $4.50-6 each. Fine, if the flavours hold up. We all found the tacos bland and under seasoned. The sauces they would use were tasty, but the ingredients themselves were very bland. It was really disappointing. 

Along with at least one of each kind of taco, we also ordered the trio of dips and chips, and the fried rice & corn fritters. The guac and the corn/ancho salsa were the highlights of the evening, but the black bean queso was cold and tasteless. The fritters were also without flavor, and there wasn't enough of the aioli it was served with to make up for it. The churros were nice, too.

But really, it wasn't a satisfying meal.

It was also insanely loud. As soon as it hit 6:45 they turned it up to club-levels, which made conversation nearly impossible. 

Overall we were disappointed. We would not recommend it or return - especially not when there's so many really amazing Mexican places to visit nearby."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal. I have celiacs and our server was able to tell me what food I could eat without hesitation. My tacos were brought out separate from everyone else's to avoid cross contamination. I was even able to eat dessert! Great food, friendly and knowledgeable servers... Awesome experience."}
{"text":"Food ambiance service pitcher of margarita .... Doesn't get much better than this. Hard to find a place that fires on all cylinders. Def recommend and will go back!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of vegetarian options, and the fish taco I had kind of tasted raw?

The popsicles are amazing! We ordered every flavour on the menu and they were all delicious. 

Great place for a meal, not so great to linger over said meal - music is super loud."}
{"text":"Good but way over hyped. The fish tacos were sub-par and the prices were too high.  Save your money for a real Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places mmmm everything is delicious. love the atmosphere (a bit loud if that bothers you). Always busy so go early."}
{"text":"They open a new one at John St and King! The new place is great. We had to wait around the area for one hour to be seated but they gave us a call at the exact time they warn us.
The food is great, tasty and well
Presented. We ordered beef and pork tacos, excellent!!! Server was nice but too busy serving lots of tables, sometimes we had to wait a lot for her to order something else.
The margarita drinks are not my favourite. They should improve that.
I returned to this place and tried the Cod tacos and I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times and the most recent will most likely be my last!  The quality of the product has deteriorated each time to the point where I find the food just edible. The taco toppings are slopped on and are not fresh, over pickled and not in good proportion relative to the main taco ingredient. The drinks are unrefined and way too sweet. I agree with some of the other reviews where stated if I reviewed this restaurant the first time I would have given a good overall recommendation however in its present state 2 stars sums it up."}
{"text":"If you've ever wondered what it's like to eat pretty great tacos in a portapotty next to the speakers at a music festival, this is the place for you. 

Seriously, that smell- do something about it."}
{"text":"My experience here was amazing. I went alone and sat down at the bar and the bartenders were fantastic. I had 2 tacos both the cheese ones. It was a deep fried cheese stick with all the toppings listed on the menu and it was delicious, perfectly spicy and flavourful. I then orders the avocado, mango salad. At the first bit of the salad I was disappointed, I was expecting more flavour. I felt it was a little bland. I made more of an effort to really taste it and took my time chewing and really tasting it. It was fresh and every bite was a little different. It was so full of fresh flavours it was really fantastic. I also had the watermelon and mint juice it was so good. I could have had several glasses. I left there feeling really full, totally bloated. I was glad I filled up on the salad because I didn't feel guilt for eating too much."}
{"text":"\"what else could you want?\" Says food critic Dean Maltby. 
Friendly staff, fast service, great atmosphere and outstanding tacos. Can't say enough about LaCarnita."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Had the corn,  cod,  chicken,  ceviche,  and pulled pork tacos. The corn was much spicer than I expected but great nonetheless! In terms of ambiance,  it was very loud and you basically have to shout. Two corn cobs and six tacos filled up the gf and I. Service was typical. I found it a tad expensive. If you've never tried this place it is definitely worth the visit. However I'd come back maybe on a semi annual basis."}
{"text":"YAY! This place was awesome. We went on a Wednesday night at 5:30 so we walked in and were seated very promptly.

The staff was extremely friendly right off the bat. We had all the tacos except the ceviche. It's one awesome bite. The pollo frito was amazing....the beef cheek was amazing....the cod was really good....the vegetarian one was really good.....and the special of the night was oooook (not my cup of tea really but cant knock the flavours). We ended with the churros which I don't usually rave over but these were soooooo yummy. Warm and comforting with just the right amount of sweetness. I can't say enough good stuff about those.

Overall, this place has a cool vibe, good music, really good food. I was super happy and my husband who loves tacos was also super happy. We paid 60$ for 11 tacos and churros.  5 star experience."}
{"text":"The only reason I wanted to write this is because I feel like their attitude towards \"not changing the menu\" needs to improve.       

Do not come to this restaurant if you do not like cilantro. They do not alter their menu to omit a particular thing you detest. Seriously, I hate cilantro, I wish I could love it because I do love Mexican food, but I can't. 

I get it, customizing orders is a pain and you believe the food tastes better the way that you make it. But let me tell you, not everyone likes what you like. And I don't think it's that hard to tell me what foods on your menu do not have cilantro, or what foods you can omit cilantro from? Instead of telling me \"we don't change the menu, unless you have an allergy\" I guess I should have said I was allergic. And like \"just pick it off\" well I would rather you just NOT put it on there in the first place?

That being said, even though I did not eat any dinner because I was promised \"there's so little cilantro you won't be able to taste it\" which I did. Thank you for that... The churros were delicious, the atmosphere was nice, and everyone in the party I was with (who have no problem with cilantro) REALLY enjoyed their food. 

Honestly, the service was great and I'm sure you guys are about a 5 star to everyone else in my group, but I just couldn't judge because I couldn't eat. And I'm really sad about that. I really wanted to eat those beautiful looking tacos."}
{"text":"Food is quite tasty but pricey.  I ordered the beef and tuna tacos.  $6-$7 average price per taco.  Wait staff needs additional training for people with dietary needs.  Menu can be improved by specifying which items can be made gluten and/or diary free.  Even Chipotle can do this and their burritos are $8.99.  Also, how hard is it to bring each person's order without asking us who ordered what ?  Ridiculous ..."}
{"text":"once you have a bite of these hot, crunchy tacos & then the fresh ingredients and hot sauce hit you... you suddenly realize that you just found an exclusive taco joint...Tostada de Ceviche, corn and dos seques are good starters.   everything we ordered off the taco menu was amazing ... interior designers nightmare but hats off to the chef  =)"}
{"text":"After fully embracing on the Mexican taco craze (who can resist?), I made sure La Carnita was on my long list of restaurants to tackle. Having experienced the insane lineups at Grand Electric, I was skeptical that I would be able to get a table for four when I arrived at 7 p.m. on a Saturday, but was pleasantly surprised when the hostess had an available table right away. 

The décor and general vibe of the restaurant is pretty cool. It's got a super laid back atmosphere and doesn't feel \"too cool\" or pretentious. I'm a fan of the amazing lighting (the cages full of lightbulbs also double as cool art!), and I like that they aren't fussy about setting up the tables, instead choosing to stack some dishes, cups and napkins in the middle. We happily landed a cozy table in the back corner, right under the La Carnita neon sign (another décor favourite). The space is small and there isn't much room between tables, but I didn't find it too be too cramped. This is definitely a hip, noisy place (think lots of chatter, background music) and not somewhere you should go if you're hoping for a quiet, romantic dinner. 

My table of four ate through a good portion of the menu, starting with the tortilla chips and dip. We tried all three, but especially loved the guacamole and sikil pak (creamy pumpkin seed dip). Up next was the Mexican street corn, which is definitely not something you should skip. Though I'm generally not a fan of eating corn on the cob (I cut off the kernals with a knife, SO WHAT), I had no problem putting aside any sense of decorum and devouring a whole cob on my own. The grilled corn was sweet, but the sauce and chili powder gave it a nice, savoury twist. Pretty sure the other patrons could relate to my new obsession: I swear I observed some man at a neighbouring table actually inhale his corn in a mere two bites. 

Between the four of us, we sampled the In Cod We Trust taco (10/10 on the delicious scale), a pulled pork with peach salsa taco (that night's special) and the tostada with tongue and grilled pineapple. I feel as though I would have enjoyed the tongue taco more if it was in a soft shell. I found it a bit tricky to squish down the ingredients on the tostada and take a bite without everything falling off. Definitely not a first date kind of dish! The taco portions were big enough that we felt satisfied with ordering two each, but I regret not trying a third. 

We couldn't bring ourselves to decide between desserts, so we sampled a bit of everything including the churros with cajeta and two different paletas (popsicles): key lime (THE FAVOURITE!) and chocolate/peanut butter. While I've always liked churros, I never considered them 'top tier' on my desserts list...until I came here. As proof of how much we liked them, we ordered a second batch. And then a third. And then we stopped because it was getting embarrassing. But not before asking for spoons so we could eat the cajeta. Yup. 

The grand total for this sinful feast was less than $30 per person, including tax and tip. I loved the free art print that came paper-clipped to the bill. A great touch. I will definitely be returning to conquer the other half of the menu sometime soon!"}
{"text":"I am 8 months pregnant and both the bartender and manager refused to make me a booze-free cocktail. F-ing unbelievable. 
I had this place on my \"no-fly\" list after they instagrammed a \"grab her by the taco\" post which was ridiculously creepy and immature, but alas it was a birthday dinner.
Huge mistake. They are still creepy and would not make me a drink without booze - I AM PREGNANT YOU CREEPS. Ugh, life being pregnant is hard enough. Never going back, seven lives is better."}
{"text":"Great food and overall love the vibe. I've been here a few times now and so far it hasn't disappointed. The first time I happened to stumble upon it while looking for a late night place eat. The gringos sign on the bottom happened to catch our eyes and the old school r&b drew us in.The portion is decent and I find that 2-3 tacos is enough for me. I highly recommend the \"in cod we trust\" (fish tacos) and whenever available, the oxtail taco."}
{"text":"I definitely love the vibe in here. The hip hop music, the dim lighting, the neon sign, the graffiti, the concrete walls, the light fixtures, the wood detailing, and the pop of colours from the chairs - It's a beautifully designed and well thought out space that perfectly reflects what La Carnita is about. 

The food menu is small, but well rounded. I made sure to try as many dishes as I could on my first visit. 

To start I had the Avocado Mango Salad, which was disappointingly small, but so delicious. It was followed by the Mexican Sweet Corn, which was absolutely amazing! The crema, cheese and chili powder take grilled corn to a new level. I highly recommend this dish. On a separate occasion had the Tortilla Chips with the Chipotle (Chicken Liver) Pate for dipping. The chips were fresh and seasoned well with ancho chili powder, and the Pate had great flavour. My only complaint is the chip to dip ratio. There was way too many chips and not much dip. I think you get more bang for your buck if you order the Tortilla Chips with all three sides for dipping instead of just the one.

For tacos, I tried all six on the menu. The Tostada de Lengua is beef tongue served on a tostada (crispy tortilla) and although it was psychologically hard for me to eat (eek tongue!), it was actually pretty good. The fish taco, In Cod We Trust, had a great balance of flavours and textures. The Crispy Avocado & Frijoles was full and meaty despite the lack of any actual meat. The Red and Green Chorizo, was made with homemade chorizo that was tender and flavourful. The chicken taco, Pollo Frito, and the steak taco, Carne Asada, weren't as good as the above mentioned tacos, but were still definitely yummy in their own right.

For dessert I had the Lime Pie Paleta (popsicle). It was the perfect combination of sour, salty and sweet. It's a great palette cleanser and the perfect way to end a meal.

La Carnita does not take reservations so be prepared to have to wait for a table during peak times especially if you're part of a large group. Thankfully you can leave you're phone number and hit up one of the many bars along College St. in the meantime. The wait is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night with a group of friends. The majority of us did not even realize this location existed. So we were pretty excited as we've had good experiences with the college location. Unfortunately, we left a little disappointed.

We tried all the different tacos including the Wednesday night special shrimp one. Being the special, we expected some great things. Unfortunately, it was not the greatest. It was soggy and the shrimp was rubbery. There were no tacos that really stood out. If I had to pick one to recommend, it would be the carnita. The flavour was decent. The ceviche was ok too. 
Whatever you do, don't bother with the churros. It was so disappointing. It lacked flavour and the texture was weird. It was as though it was re-fried. To add insult to injury, the order included 3 but it came with 4 and we thought we scored a free one...but no we were charged extra when the bill came. Funny thing is we even told the server we didn't think it was our order because we only just put it in and it was for 3...oh well. 

The staff were great. They were attentive...maybe a bit too much though. They were like napkin thieves haha Every time one of us went to grab our napkins, it had already been taken away. I understand tacos can get a bit messy but we went from having a pile to none at all because they kept getting taken away if it was not flat on the table. 

All in all you are better off going elsewhere for tacos."}
{"text":"I can't lie. I'm a total fan of La Carnita. And that was when they were a roaming pop-up. Now they've got their brick and mortar down and are open for business. Had to drop by for opening, especially since I am just down the street.

It's not a complicated menu, and even eating solo, I managed a third of it. 6 tacos currently available at $5 a shot. Not super cheap, but they're not small things either. Chips + guac, Voltron fish taco, and the key lime pie dessert are all pretty damn tasty. 

Four cocktails on the menu. Had their version of a whisky sour - the Who Shot Ya? - and thought it a nice summery drink. Beer, tequila, and wine round out the alcohol.

It was just a quick tour today. Will look forward to stopping by again and exploring more of their menu."}
{"text":"Tacos are good but not spicy. Almost impossible to converse as music is loud. Great tequila list. The wine not so great and very, very small servings."}
{"text":"We walked in a little past 6p on Sunday night. It was quite busy but we were lucky to score one of the remaining tables.

It's a dark, casual, loud, vibey place with quick and easy service. The menu was short and sweet, but managed to offer a good variety. Starters include baked tortilla chips with a variety of dips to choose from, chiles rellendos (didn't try), avocado mango salad, and mexican sweet corn. The tacos are $5 each, and there are 6 offerings. The \"dulce\" section listed another three options (churros, lime pie, and pineapples).

Our server recommended that the typical person orders three tacos. We ordered the tortilla chips with the three sides (a sesame, a guacamole and a chipotle pate, I believe?). All three were great, but my favourite was the pate with it's lightly spiced kick, followed closely by the guac. I went with two tacos: the In Cod We Trust and the Tostada de Lengua. The cod was pretty good, and I'd order it again, but I really liked the tostada. I followed them up with an order of the mexican sweet corn ($7 for two big ones), which was smothered in mexican crema and an assortment of spices. It was soooo good, so sweet and incredibly messy. Make sure you have extra napkins before you start!

Others also ordered the carne asada (steak, slightly chewy), the pollo frito (chicken, \"meh\" reaction), and the crispy avocado and frijoles tacos, and they were less enthused, so I would recommend going with my selection for a first visit.

Orders were quick, food came out quickly, extra orders were quick, bill came quickly (when we requested it). For a party of five, we were in and out in under 90 minutes, and the finally tally was around $20 per person (most people had three tacos).

I'd return if we were in the area. I thought the price point was great for the food, and they were very smooth with their service."}
{"text":"Hit La Carnita last week and can't stop thinking about it!!!

The food is incredible, the service is awesome and the atmosphere is amazing. We bumped into old colleagues and were able to set up a business meeting which is always a score.

I recommended staying a while and slowly ordering dishes to really get a good try of everything on the menu.

The fish tacos and corn are my fav!"}
{"text":"..Because service and preparation time is incredibly quick (despite the busy dining room), it's easy to sort of order as you go, and gauge your own satiety.  Over the course of the night, we tried:

Choriqueso (Frijoles, chorizo, salsa fresca, melted oaxaca and cotija cheese)

Freshly fried, and perfectly spiced, those chips were incredibly addictive. I was worried this might come out like some slutty greasy cheese dip, but it was suprisingly refreshing.  There was a perfect amount of salty cheese that it didn't overwhelm the flavours of the beans and the chorizo.  

Mexican Street Corn (Mexican crema, queso anejo, arbol and ancho chili powder)
 

I had sampled this once before at a TUM event, and I fell in love them.  I cannot imagine a more satisfying combination of flavours.  The corn is sweet and slightly smokey, the cheese is salty and briny, the crema is luscious with a mild tart bite, and the chili lends that balancing level of heat.  I am convinced that come summer time, this is the only way I will be allowed to serve corn in our house....."}
{"text":"Terrible. Average food - deep fried chicken/fish/etc in a taco. Shockingly bad service...asked for the corn to be cut in two but apparently this is too hard for the kitchen, got our order wrong, and music's loud AF as well. They even had the audacity to slap a forced 18% 'gratuity' on top of the $380 bill (for 6) as well. Far better options around John, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I came for brunch service (when they still had this at the end of summer) with my cousin.  We had a mango avocado salad, the lamb bacon and eggs taco, churros, and really terrific cocktails - I had a tomatillo Caesar.

The mango avocado salad was probably more on the average side (but still delicious), but the lamb bacon really kicked it out of the park for me.  It's like regular brunch with a flavourful twist in the lamb.  I've also had churros at a couple of places in Toronto, and still, La Carnita is my fave in terms of taste + just the right crunchy texture.

Also, the Caesar packs a punch but is a very tasty drink.

This place is perfect for casual dining and great eats. Yum!"}
{"text":"It's such a shame that the service is really what brings this place down. The location is cool and the tacos are definitely great (if not a tad more expensive then elsewhere but oh well!) but the service is comically bad. We waited about an hour for our tacos, which is pretty unacceptable for what is essentially street food. I typically order a couple of rounds but after that wait I just told the server we'd grab the bill. When I informed her that we had waited as long as we had she said \"you're f***ing with me right?\" and tossed the bill. My apologies for not proselytizing at the great altar of the taco."}
{"text":"Been in Toronto now for 5 years - never have I had worst service, bland average overrated food for wannabe cool hipsters. Not to mention the fact I froze my nuts off for 60 minutes whilst eating."}
{"text":"I have heard of La Carnita being one of the top Mexican restaurants in the city so when they opened up a new location on John St. I was very excited to try it.
I hope the original location on College St is better, because this visit didn't impress me.
We ordered the Chips with Dip, Scorpion Wings, and a few tacos.
The Chips with Dip is pretty standard, the dips were ok but the Chips were hard and thick and tasted over fried. They didn't have that freshly made taste to them and didn't have much flavor.
The Scorpion wings were also just ok, very saucy but the chicken itself wasn't very juicy.
The Tacos just can't compare to say Grand Electric's. The shells were thick and a bit dry, flavor profile was just ok, and the fried cod taco didn't have that light and crispy texture that you'd expect.
The food was just ok, but the interior was funky and hip and would make a good date spot.
We probably will try their original location next time, but won't be back at this one."}
{"text":"4.5 stars! 

I once made an attempt to line up for La Carnita's famous tacos at TUM but after waiting over an hour in negative 20 degree weather and only halfway through the line, I gave up. Now that this popular pop-up has opened up a permanent location on College Street, just west of Bathurst, it was finally time to find out what all the hype is about.

What went in my belly:

Avocado Mango Salad - with cilantro, lime dressing, queso fresco & pepitas ($8): One of my favourites of the evening. The mango salad was served on top of half an avocado. There were some peppers sprinkled throughout the salad which added a nice little kick. It was a light and refreshing dish - perfect for the summer!

Mexican Street Corn - Mexican crema, queso anejo, arbol & ancho chili powder ($8): The combination of the butter, salt, spice and sweetness from the corn was perfection.  I just wouldn't recommend it if you're trying here trying to impress someone...it's not the most elegant food to eat and it left my teeth full of corn. Oh, and at $8, I found the price to be really steep for 2 pieces of corn. I've never paid this much for corn before...

In Cod We Trust - Voltron sauce, lime crema, pickled red cabbage, green apple & cilantro ($5): This fish taco consisted of a beer battered piece of fish with a bit of tartness and crunch coming from the red cabbage and green apple. And whatever the \"Voltron\" sauce is, it was really working for me. 

Carnitas - pork confit, guacamole, salsa verde, pickled onions & cilantro. A classic Mexican taco done perfectly.

Crispy Avocado & Frijoles - beans, crispy avocado, jicama, chipotle sauce, queso fresco & cilantro. I have to admit, this was surprisingly delicious for a meatless taco. I'm also not a huge fan of beans but I still really enjoyed it as it bound all the components of the taco together. 

Tostada de Lengua - cilantro verde, cashew sauce, grilled pineapple, radish & beet sprouts. Unlike the rest of the tacos, this one is served on a tostada (a fried tortilla) and eaten with a fork.  It consisted of thin slices of tongue and the crunch from the tostada was a nice contrast to the tender tongue. 

Strawberry Paleta ($4): ). It was very small treat and I found it on the pricey side for $4. However, price aside, I really enjoyed it and found it to be a really refreshing dessert. 

Churros - with housemade cajeta ($5) arrived. It came with three mini churros served in a tea cup with cajeta at the bottom of it. While the churros were hot, crunchy and delicious, it was the housemade cajeta which really elevated this dessert. 

So, was it worth all the hype? You bet! We both enjoyed all the tacos but the corn (albeit a bit pricey) and the churros were also finger-licking good."}
{"text":"I love this place. 
Best Mexican food in the City.
You will defnt have to wait for a table.
It's super popular and busy.
This location doesn't take reservations.
It's a small place with small tables and chairs
Food comes out relatively quickly
Guac is great
Meatballs are sooo great.
I would skip the chicken crispy taco and stick with the beef, pork and cod
Overall, a great place to eat or take someone from out of town.
Super fun :)  I go back all the time."}
{"text":"I love La Carnita. The College Street location was my go-to spot when I lived in the area and it is a place I frequently recommend to friends. Gourmet tacos, a cool vibe, excellent service and great cocktails - what isn't to love?

When I heard that they had opened a bigger King West-area (more specifically John & Adelaide) location, I was thrilled. My best girlfriend, who had never had a La Carnita experience (but had heard me rave about it numerous times), and I decided to hit it up.

At around 5:30 on a Friday night, we weren't able to get a table but were told we could get full service at the bar. We went upstairs and sat down in some super comfy, cushy rusted orange chairs (love!) at the side area of the bar. 

It took about 15 minutes, maybe even longer, before anyone approached us. A waitress came and asked if we had been helped. When we said we hadn't, she joked about us being neglected, apologized and took our order (a margarita each, Mexican Street Corn, two Pollo Frito tacos). We laughed and shook it off. 

Our margaritas arrived soon after. They were decent but I'm not sure I would order again-- there wasn't even a salted rim at $9! I recall having much better-made and presented drinks at the College Street location.

The Street Corn was amazing, as I had expected from my past La Carnita experiences. I definitely recommend ordering it.

The Pollo Frito tacos (crispy chicken thigh, peanut mole, honey, Rossy's hot sauce, green cabbage & salsa fresca) were wonderful. The chicken was perfect and the sauce & salsa pulled it all together perfectly. My company was super impressed! 

Our plates were cleared by another waiter almost immediately after we finished. Our waitress, though visibly nearby and even walking by us at some points, didn't acknowledge us for another 15 minutes. We wanted to order more, but she didn't stop by. 

Once our clearly neglectful waitress finally came by, we ordered two more tacos: In Cod We Trust and Crispy Cotija. 

Ten minutes later, two tacos arrived: a Crispy Cotija and a Pollo Frito. Um, not exactly what we ordered... We told the waiter and he took them back to the kitchen. Our waitress stopped by, clarified our order and said it was a mix-up on the kitchen's behalf, not hers, seeming pretty defensive about it. We again, shook it off and assured her it wasn't a big deal. Her tone was very unprofessional and kind of threw us off. 

Our correct order came about 5 minutes later. No big deal. Both tacos were great. My friend raved about the In Cod We Trust.

Again, our plates were cleared almost immediately after, but our waitress just lingered and never acknowledged us. After 10 minutes, I finally waved her down to place our final order: Churros. 

The Churros arrived within 5 minutes of placing our order. They were warm and sugary and delicious, especially when smothered in the housemade cajeta. They made a perfect surgery end to a mildly spicy meal. I always (and will always) order this whenever I go to La Carnita. Highly recommend. 

Overall, I would skip this location, purely because of the crappy, neglectful service. If you want a fully excellent La Carnita experience go to College Street."}
{"text":"This place only deserves 3 stars and the reason for that is the following.

CONS:
-Service is just ok. When we sat at he bar there was a young bartender who was taking care of us and he was great! As oppose to his coworker, an older gentleman with a big white beard who was very rude and unpleasant. 
Once we got sat at our table, we waited for quiet some time for our new server who ended up taking her time to do anything.
-The restaurant ran out of their special for the night very early in the evening, pork belly. We were there at 7:45pm, I think that's quiet early.

PROS:
-Food was delicious, freash and full of flavor.
-Atmosphere was great along with the music.

We would defginately try a different location next time."}
{"text":"Come here regularly and always a packed house. The chicken wings, meatballs and Mexican corn are to die for. No better way to end it off then with one of Sweet Jesus Paletas! 

Can't wait for the King West location to be open."}
{"text":"Great food, ambiance and atmosphere, just like the West end variety. Beautiful plates and trendy people. Drinks are pricey for volume but not beyond belief. The food is mucho delicious, though a bit overpowering with its spices. All in all, a great outing in Leslieville for a small group."}
{"text":"La Carnita is good. The tacos are good and the space is nice. That said, the tacos, although more presentable are not as good as Grand Electric. The tortilla chips and guacamole are not as good either. 

The atmosphere is hipster hip hop so not that kid friendly. Many a hipster fam brave the atmosphere for the grub but it's not easy. 

I'd recommend it but go early. You can't get take out which sucks and it's always uber busy."}
{"text":"Very nice place inside/outside.  It is very designed and clean. A couple of the female staff could use an attitude adjustment though. They seemed cranky and annoyed. As a customer, nobody cares if you're having a bad day. 

I also found the music too loud. I'm not a prude, I just found it hard to hear the person I was with.

As impressive and sexy the design/layout is, the prices of drinks are just too high to make it a regular spot for me. The lowest price beer is $7. They need a generic beer or house specialty priced at $5. I'm aware they have happy hour specials, but for anyone looking to go for some casual drinks in the evening, you will find your bill much higher than you expected."}
{"text":"Went to La Carnita for dinner, loved the Carne Asada tacos. Tried the chicken and chorizo tacos and they were subpar, definitely not up to par with the cost. Would NOT reccomend this location. Also ordered a pitcher of margarita as the hostess explained it would be a light balanced drink. Turns out, it was like drinking concentrated tequila. Definitely would not reccomend ANY of the margaritas. Overall, was unhaply with my experience here. The prices are overpriced in comparison to portion size. 
One plus point was the churros we had ordered at the end (if anything just go to La Carnita for the churros and take them TO GO)."}
{"text":"Well, where to begin? I came here with my food buddy since someone he knew recommended it. That's usually how we roll. Someone says it's good and we're there. In this case, we kinda wish we weren't. That's the problem with restaurant chains. Someone goes to one location and has a great time, somebody else visits another and it sucks balls. Like that one time I had dinner @ The Keg in Vaughan with another friend and before the entries showed up, we became the radioactive table. But that's another story.

The atmosphere at La Carnita was alright. Plenty of indoor seating and a nice patio. The service...could use improvement. Maybe we were expecting too much but do I really need to ask for napkins, plates, and utensils? TWICE? It wasn't exactly busy. So...what gives, people?

Anyway, we definitely enjoyed the appetizers which included the Mexican Street Corn and the Chicken Quesadilla. It would have been even more enjoyable with plates and napkins. Ok, now I'm just being petty. We ordered tacos and admittedly, they weren't bad but when the server brought them over, I know my buddy and I thought the same thing: where's the rest of it? Seriously, it was like looking at kid's meals. Also, messy. Plates and napkins would have helped. Yes, I know. Petty.

At the end of it all, our bill came to about $70 total. The amount of food we got was not worth it. The scales were definitely not balanced here, but I get it. It's like Russian roulette (except no one dies - unless you are just one really unlucky poor bastard). Just because it wasn't a hit for us and I won't be going back doesn't mean it will be the same for someone else. Maybe you enjoy paying a lot for kids portions. Maybe you have a small stomach. I don't know. You decide."}
{"text":"Nice place, good music and vibe. But overly busy, which I think killed the food , and the staffs
competence.

Around $5 + is the going rate for tacos in the city so their menu is fairly priced for ONE taco, with one tortilla. The grilled fish taco was decent as they gave a big chunk of fish but unfortunately it was burnt and covered by corn bits. Carne asada was meh. Ceviche tostado was good albeit not so fresh. Fish taco probably the best but would have had another tortilla underneath to grab the pieces and juice that fell out. 

Service was friendly enough considering how busy it was on a Thursday after work. Tequila list ok but overpriced. All in all, would go back again for drinks vibe etc but probably not craving any specific menu item."}
{"text":"Affordable, delicious Mexican food. The service isn't the greatest - whenever I go the place is always PACKED! Atmosphere is awesome - very noisy but fun!"}
{"text":"Cilantro on EVERYTHING is unacceptable.  Like many, I love a good taco.  Also, like many, I love a good margarita!  What I don't love (again, like many) is cilantro.  *insert rehearsed speech on how cilantro tastes like soap to some people...genetic disposition...terrible taste..etc..etc)*  

I've been to (I would say) most Mexican joints across Toronto.  I know all too well that cilantro is a staple ingredient in the cuisine.  I have this great speech prepared for when I go for Mexican food expressing that I'm one of THOSE people that don't like cilantro and to please steer me away from cilantro-heavy items.  I also always request no cilantro garnish.  That's not too hard to accommodate, right?  \"Please don't sprinkle an additional item onto my tacos that will ruin my dining experience.\"  Playa Cabana doesn't think it's too difficult.  Milagro and El Catrin also feel the same way.  

Unfortunately, La Carnita is far too busy breeding terrible customer service to accommodate any such requests.  \"The chef feels that cilantro is essential to the dish and won't accommodate any alterations.\"  Of course, when we asked to speak to a manager, our sub-par waitress just happened to be the manager, lucky us!  

My favourite part of the meal was when we asked for the one item that did not have any cilantro on it, the chicken wings.  Low and behold, covered in cilantro!  ANDDDDDD not just cilantro, micro-cilantro.  As if to rub it in my face, the entire staff sitting there, steepling their hands together like Mr. Burns and saying, \"we've replaced the full-sized cilantro that's easy to pick off with small -- no, MICRO cilantro that's way more difficult to remove!!!!! Mwuhahaha\".    I may be exaggerating a little bit...BUT there was micro-cilantro, there was a lot of it, and I'm sure they were snickering.  When we asked \"the manager\" about it, she informed us that they were just micro-greens.  We all know that micro-cilantro is both a micro-green and cilantro, right?  Surely that was covered in La Carnita's cilantro bootcamp training.  That's week 1 course material for sure!

At this point, my buddy and I were drunk and we had lost the fight.  But the battle for cilantro-free tacos is not over!   Stand proud with me as we fight for taco liberation! #CilantroFreeTacos"}
{"text":"I am starting my foodie journey and I am so glad I choose this place to be my first place to eat. The service was amazing from the moment I walked in. We got there around 6:45 ( before the crazy line started to grow)  the wait was said to be about 30 minutes but it took only 20 minutes at most. The corn was amazing ( that says a lot coming from someone who doesn't like corn) the tacos where perfect, we wanted to try all the tacos  but we got so full by the third round. I would of given this restaurant a 5/5 but I didn't really like the little nook by the window where we were sitting. Other than that... AMAZING.

*I recommend going there early before 7:30 pm to avoid a two hour wait.*"}
{"text":"I was very excited to go there based on all the pictures I saw on Instagram.  The minute my friends and I walked in (4 ppl), we were greeted by a hostness who was not very polite. Asking customers in front of you to wait while picking up the phone repeatedly during the 2 minute conversation.  In addition, the hostness was  talking to her friend about a personal problem, instead of taking our reservation. 

However, I was expecting better service when we were seated. We placed our order relatively quickly. Our appetizers were great (mango salad,meatballs, corn). To our disappointment the sangria pitcher which cost $55 was filled with 3/4 ice and probably the worse sangaria I have had. After waiting for nearly 30 mins, the server told us the kitchen is busy. We waited for 1 1/2 hour before cancelling our order and walking out. Our bill was $96 (24 pp) and we were starving."}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday night around 7 pm. We had to wait around 40 minutes for a party of 5 before we were seated. Unfortunately the tacos did not live up to our expectations. We had better ones in town. We found it to lack in flavours. The mexican corns were quite good. 
The place was noisy, but it was to be expected as there were lots of people and we didn't really mind. The servers can be nicer in my opinion."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly one of the best meals I've ever had. Started with the street corn and chips with guacamole. Had the \"In Cod We Trust\" taco and the ceviche tostada as a main. Finished it off with a key lime popsicle. 

When I first put in my order I was questioning my choice of both of their fish dishes, but once I had them I realized I had made the right choice. The cod was lightly battered and spicey whereas the ceviche was (obviously) very light and clean. They complimented each other well.

I will be back. Many times.

Side note- beer prices are about the norm ($6 or so), but their cocktails are getting up there price-wise, I think $11 for their specialty drinks."}
{"text":"I came here with 2 other friends. I think everyone hyped this up way too much. I'm not a newbie to Mexican food so I was really disappointed coming here. The pros for this place was the atmosphere, service and presentation. The cons, it's way too over priced. We got tacos and dip for appetizer and it was amazing. But the tacos We didn't even finish it. Me and my friends all got a different Taco so we could try each others. First- our tacos were all in different plates and even when the waitress told us which one was which, we still had to guess and plate it out ourselves. All of our tacos literally fell apart in a bite and there was so much juice coming out of the taco. So we had to ask for forks because you couldn't even eat it like a taco. Also, all of our tacos had the same spiciness to it. So we kind of felt like we were eating the same thing but with different meat because the spicy over powered everything. I would only come back here for the appetizers in all honesty and maybe a drink or two."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Food and drink were equally spectacular. You'll likely have to wait a while for a table - be prepared for it. Service was great, food quality amazing and huge points for style. Music is cool, but pretty loud, so dinner conversation is not exactly easy."}
{"text":"Second time eating at La Carnita. I tried La Carnita for the first time at the College St. location and to be honest, I wasn't impressed. I thought I wasn't going to go back since I thought their tacos didn't compare to Grand Electric. This time, I was in the area and decided to give it another go.

I gotta say, the tacos were bomb! I went on a Wednesday and the daily special was the pork belly which had a spike of Hoisin sauce and wasn't overly salty. The other taco I tried was Pollo Frito and I thought it was excellently cooked with the right amount of crispiness and juiciness in the chicken thigh.

Would come back any day!"}
{"text":"Come on, Mexican food is NOT fancy cucine.
Very expensive, pretentious and noisy restaurant. Tacos were totally cold and super small."}
{"text":"My star rating is solely based on the foood!! The food here is excellent! I have been to this place a few times now and the food has never been a disappointment! Always full of flavour and just super yummy !!! 

The drinks are real expensive and pretty small, so I will steer clear of those next time. 

But the main catastrophe happening here. Is the staff. I personally had an incredible waitress when I was dining. She was very informative and took the time to speak with us about the menu and the options and make sure that we were happy! But the people bringing the food were so rude !!!!! Almost like that \"i'm a hipster and i'm way better than you are\" vibe, yeah it was horrible you couldn't ask them questions unless you were ready to get a snippy answer!! When you walk in NO ONE GREETS YOU!!!!! The worst ! And these hostess's run by you and don't even acknowledge the fact that you're here, don't reply when you speak to them. It was overall immature, it's like there was 15, 25yr old to cool for school kids running the show making everyone feel like an inconvenience. 

Either way I'll put up with their garbage service for the food."}
{"text":"Unique tacos.  Great atmosphere, a place where you can be casual or dressed up.  Small tacos lets you try a lot of variety. Definitely not the healthiest but wonderful I you're looking for food with a bite."}
{"text":"Sunday night dinner at La Carnita.

We've been waiting for a while to check it out, had previously eaten their tasty tacos at pop-ups and other food festivals. Arrived at 5:30pm and had no problem getting a table for six. As we waited for our party to arrive, we ordered drinks & an order of tortilla chips with three sides: guacamole, sikil pak & mezcal chipotle liver pate ($13). I ordered their margarita ($10) which was good, though needed to be a tiny bit sweeter.  The tortilla chips and side dips arrived and the first thing I noticed was that they chips were seasoned. Seasoned very aggressively this in my opinion ruined everything that accompanied them. Couldn`t waste the guacamole, sikil pak and liver pate because all you could taste was the chips. Tasted each dip without a chip. All were good, my favourite being the pate. 

Once the rest of our group arrived we ordered our mains. I ordered the Mexican Street Corn ($8), Swordfish Ceviche ($10), then two tacos: In Cod We Trust and Tostada de Lengua (both $4.75). The corn was awesome, similar to the corn at Grand Electric as well as Café Habana in NY: buttered, and then covered in paprika, parmesan & creamy white sauce. It was awesome.  The over-seasoned tortillas made a second appearance with the ceviche which ruined the dish. All I could taste was the chip seasoning not the great taste of fresh fish with acid and spice. Very disappointing. Taco time: the fish taco was great as usual, the addition of apple slaw is amazing. But the tongue tostada was super unbalanced, way too much heat and not enough mango to counter it. It left my mouth burning well into dessert (and I LOVE SPICY food). 

Finished our meal with Paletas, essentially fancy popsicles. Our table ordered a bunch of them; I tried the Key Lime Pie, Peach & Chocolate Peanut Butter with the Key Lime & Chocolate being my favourites. 
Service was good, prompt and attentive.  

Overall, our experience was fine. Would I go again...probably not, if I have a hankering for hip hop and Mexican, I`ll go to Grand Electric."}
{"text":"This place is happening on Thusday night.  Quite busy so service is kinda lacking but atmosphere is good. We could only eat at the sides so we didnt get a table. 


Pros
-high quality tacos and corn
-must try ice cream, c&c is worth it 


cons
-$$ for what you get"}
{"text":"July 2012

Just returned home after trying out La Carnita. 
My partner and I thoroughly enjoy authentic Mexican fare - but I would not insult our Southern neighbours by comparing Mexican fare with what is served at this restaurant.
In fact, our meal tonight was truly and exquisitely...disgusting.
The starters were Canadian take-offs of the real thing - passable guacomole but served with cold nacho chips laden with oil, and ceviche that lacked any hint of swordfish flavor. Then the 'special of the day' taco - pork confit with a Mexican cheese, flavored with jalapeño and cilantro. How can one go wrong, one might ask? Well, the smell emanating
from this tiny offering was so bad that I had to ask my partner if something in it was 'off' - then I took one bite and had to spit it out - something I haven't done since I was 5 years old!!!
My partner and I know food and cheeses, including some of the latter that carry an offensive nose to someone with a bit less experience. But the stink of this taco was beyond the beyond - someone had obviously abused this cheese, as a chef-friend of ours would have said. 
I'm no food snob, but like a decent offering as much as the next person.
My rating for this restaurant is 1/10 - the server smiled at us, once."}
{"text":"All of my friends love this place, but I think they could do a lot better. Music is good, and the food is good too. However the quantity is way off. Some plates are too small and not filling at all. They are also very crowded on fri and sat because its more like a club than a restaurant. They are also very over priced for the most basic things like Tacos - $9. Waste of money for that location considering there are a ton of other options."}
{"text":"Quantities were excellent. Service was great. I'm not kidding. The older gentleman who was waiting on us was great. Food was pretty good. Sitting beside the storage closet door wasn't so nice. Overall was definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience!
Had the pollo & beef cheek tacos which were delicious. Highly recommend. Service was great, attentive and fast (and it was packed on a Tuesday night). Had the baby mama to drink - watermelon juice made the beverage! All in all, cannot wait to return. 
Fair warning, those who do not like so cut food should not order the corn (appetizer) as it was rather hot. However, if hot food is your thing then do not miss this app."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food is amazing. But the service my god! The servers are so pretentious and rude. I have been here several times now because I am so determined to give them a shot, but every time I have left frustrated by the attitude of the servers. First, I don't like cilantro. I am not unique in this regard. Tons of people don't like cilantro. When I asked for it not to appear on my taco, I was told it would \"ruin the integrity of the taco\" and therefore they would not remove the cilantro. Like, are you kidding me? Another time I took my mother there for her birthday dinner. The music was playing SO LOUD that the bass was literally vibrating the entire restaurant. When I politely asked my server if he could turn down the music, he very rudely told me \"that is how they like\" - who is they?? When I pressed him saying that it was difficult to hold a conversation with such loud music, he scoffed and said he would try. He then ignored our table for the rest of the evening. Lastly, they also don't do split bills. This is so annoying. I have worked in several restaurants and know it is NOT THAT HARD to split bills. Lazy servers don't like to split bills. End of story. Will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Came across this Mexican place and two others this weekend. I would say this one is on par with Grand Electric but Mexican Amigos is much better. I don't like feeling cramped, or not being able to sit with all my friends because of resto size issues. This and Grand Electric are more trendy Queen West type of vibes. The food selection is slim - really just assortments of tacos.... but at Mexican Amigos there is a wider range, like chimichangas, ceviches, enchiladas, burritos etc."}
{"text":"Delish! Go for the corn and the fish Tacos. Although I didn't try them myself, everyone at the table raved about the beef tongue tacos. Stay for the desserts...key lime pie popsicles--hello!"}
{"text":"I've been following La Carnita as a pop up and went to their incredible UNO art show earlier in the year so my review might be slightly fan-boy bias. With that out of the way, I have to say that I absolutely love the new permanent locale on College.

The Experience:
The decor of the restaurant is superb, starting with the Gringo tiled into the entrance and ending with the glow of the neon La Carnita sign in the back. Staff is friendly and helpful though I have to say that my only gripe about eating here is a couple of bad experiences with the same waitress. Apart from the one bad apple the hostess, bartenders and all other wait staff have been fantastic. The music is great classic hip hop played at a decent volume so be prepared to talk over it with everyone else.

Be prepared to wait unless you get there for opening at 5. Standard wait for my visits has been about 40 minutes but they will text you so usually its fine to just go grab a drink somewhere else while you wait.

The Food:
Apps. The tortilla chips are great to share with a group but for future visits I will take a pass on the Liver Pate. The Guac & Sikil Pak however are delicious and flavorful. The Mexican Street Corn brings a kick that is smoothed out by the crema sauce, love it. Closer to launch they also had incredible stuffed chilis on the menu but unfortunately they have been replaced by the rice & corn frituras. I haven't tried them or the salad or ceviche yet.

Tacos. I've tried them all. The staple of La Carnita is In Cod We Trust and it doesn't disappoint ever. The chicken taco packs a nice punch. The chorizo has great flavors. The avacado & frijoles is the only disappointing taco I've had, there's really not much going on here. Thankfully it's backed up by the incredibly balanced Tostada de Lengua. Of the specials I've had the braised pork was excellent, lots of flavor with some pineapple bits to smooth out the finish. If I had to rank them I would go:
Cod - Tostada - (Pork Special) - Chicken - Chorizo - Avacado Frijoles

Desserts. To finish the meal there are a couple great choices. The churros are a decent size, cooked to perfection and best eaten while hot with the sublime dulce de leche sauce that comes with. However the better option is the paleta. I've only had the lime version but it's the perfect way to finish a meal here, a nice light sweet lime that is wonderfully encrusted in graham cracker crumble.

The Art:
Of course you can't cover La Carnita without the amazing art work. Each month they commission a new artist for a fresh take on their meat-head logo. They also had a large print for their one-year anniversary not too long ago. My favorite of the bunch so far is the chili chihuahua. They will give you a single print free with your meal.

I've been many times so far and will certainly be back many more."}
{"text":"Went here the other night. I love it when a friend recommends a restaurant to me that's in the downtown core and then I find another location on Queen St. E! So much closer for us and the parking situation is ace! We found a parking right in front and parking is free after 6pm!!! Ok enough about that onto the rating which I will break down into pros and cons as it is easier.

PROS:
- While the restaurant is a bit oddly laid out, it's got ample space which is great for busier nights. We went on a weekday night and so there was no wait time but I imagine it gets really busy on weekends
- Staff is amazing. No seriously. They constantly checked on us, cleared our plates, filled our waters and we were able to make multiple orders with different staff. They never gave us that look like \"uh hello I ain't yo server\". I wanted to pay the bill covertly and the only person near me was a girl at the bar. I expected a \"wait for your server\" but nope! Gladly helped and made the whole 'operation' run smoothly lol. We also got good recommendations as to what to order as well as a tip: order 2 tacos first and see how you feel...then order more if need be. I was full after 2 so that worked out nicely
- I will go into more detail but the food was so tasty. I went with a foodie friend of mine and she kept saying how happy she was because it was so good

CONS:
- I think several reviewers have mentioned this but...the music is actually comically loud. I didn't notice it at first until I realized I was yelling at my friends to be heard. I find it an odd choice and it doesn't really add anything to the ambience. Maybe bring it down a few decibels?
- We got a chips and dip platter and we ran out of chips so we asked if we could have more. We only needed maybe 5 more chips to finish up the dip. We were charged $4.00 for them. I actually knocked off a star for this because that has never happened to me before...I mean come on are we supposed to eat the dip with our hands?! Also tortilla chips are like 5 cents. If we had known we would have wrapped them up and taken them home! Ah well.
- Price. It doesn't seem like it at first but once you order multiple tacos, appetizers and drinks, it really adds up! Minus tip, our bill came up to $120 for 3 people. Maybe this is the norm I dunno...but I did feel that it was a bit much. Not complaining too much though because the meal was good.

WHAT WE ORDERED:
Sorry can't remember the exact names:
Beef Tacos: Amazing. Best one of the night. The toppings compliment perfectly. ($4.75)
Chicken Tacos: Only ok but still tasty. ($4.75)
Fish Tacos: Tasty as well but similar to other places I've been. I think I may like Grand Electric's version slightly better. ($4.75)
Pork Hock Taco: The special of the night, similar to pulled pork. My hubs said it tasted the same as the carnita taco but with a different sauce ($4.75)
Carnita Taco: Only ok but tasty ($4.75)
Ceviche Taco: My friend said this one was really good ($6.25)
Dip platter: Was only ok, could have passed on it plus the chip situation mentioned above didn't help ($14+$4 for extra chips)
Ribs: Holy crap were these good. The sauce was amazing. Only wish there were more than 4 on the plate ($12)
Churros: Really, really delicious. Comes with an amazing dipping sauce ($6)
Popsicles: Ok so the staff mentioned that they were known for this so we ordered. Hubs got the cookie one and said it was very good. My friend and I got the chocolate peanut butter and we weren't huge fans as it was just a fudgesicle with peanuts on top. And the peanuts were a bit too salty for our liking. I wish I got the Corn Pops one. ($4/each)

Overall, I MIGHT go back but I'm mainly just glad we tried it and have good memories of the place. Oh one more thing! We were comped one extra taco! It was so nice of them and I don't really know why. Could be because they accidentally made an extra one?"}
{"text":"It was a surprisingly empty Resturent for Thursday lunch with 5 empty tables and no reservation signs. However, we were still made to wait 20 mins! Terrible service. Would not go back."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! best street tacos I've ever tried. Great, friendly service. Super fun atmosphere but as hipster as hispter gets; 90's and 2000's hip hop playing; pretty loud for conversations though. Worth the wait (no reservations) but avoid the weekends- I don't understand how anyone gets in.

Order everything- sample all the tacos; they're all incredibly put together and fresh."}
{"text":"The corn! A must try, even when it's not corn season they have really plump corn. The sauce on top is amazing.

All tacos were very tasty and the portion was perfect so that you can try the other tyes as well. Depending on the individual , some may prefer fish over chicken ..I really liked the beef taco.

Dessert: Key lime pie popsicle.  A must try!

Would come here over and over again!"}
{"text":"Really good alcoholic drinks. Amazing fresh juice. Guacamole is delicious but spicy and the waiters / waitresses are SO SO SO nice!! Kale ceaser salad is also amazee"}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend and there was no wait! 

We got seated right away!

Ordered:
-mexican street corn: this was really good! I loved the crema sauce on the corn, it was really flavourful
-in cod we trust taco
-pollo frito taco
-chorizo taco
-beef cheek taco
-tostada de ceviche
-wild crab tostada(on the current daily specials)

Overall, I enjoyed the food a lot. I really liked the crab tostada ,  however it is a daily special so it isn't available everyday."}
{"text":"4 out of 5! Great place for tacos and sharing! I recommend the cod and crispy avocado tacos!"}
{"text":"I went to La Carnita with a friend on a Wednesday around 6, and it wasn't busy yet so we were quickly seated. We stayed until around 7 when it started to pick up, so I would recommend coming earlier if possible. The restaurant doesn't do reservations so you may be stuck waiting. 

Our waiter was very pushy, which dampened the overall experience. He interrupted our conversation to give us the menu and seemed keen to rush us out of the restaurant at every stage. I know it's a popular place and they want to free up tables, but it there were several empty tables while we were eating, so it didn't seem justified. 

They have daily specials and a pretty simple menu, similar to other Mexican places I've been to. I decided to try the horchata (mostly because of the Vampire Weekend song) and it was very refreshing and sweet. I got the pollo frito and the In Cod We Trust which were both delicious. Its hard to eat one of these tacos gracefully, but if you don't mind getting your hands dirty it'll be well worth it. 

Coming from 7 lives, I wasn't really used to eating a taco with only one layer of wrapping and I think these were particularly flimsy, which made them harder to eat. They also had less filling than tacos had other places I've been, but the taco shells seemed a bit fresher. Also unlike 7 lives they don't have many hot sauce options. They have a brown sauce that is somewhat spicy, but I like my tacos really spicy so it didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"While they taste great, the tacos are very pricy for what you're getting. The music is so loud that you end up yelling to one another. It's a great place to go for a drink but definitely not a date night dinner."}
{"text":"What a gem!  I'm a bit of a Mexican, Southwestern food snob and was a bit skeptical but now it's the place to satisfy my cravings.  The flavours are traditional with a modern twist and excellent preparation.  There were great cocktails with a very comfy atmosphere. The real shocker was the desert menu.....a perfect combination of classic flavours with creativity.  Loved this spot and will return with more friends soon!"}
{"text":"Pollo Frito: Decent. Fried chicken and mayo is a safe combination.

Carnita: Average flavors. Forgettable.

In Cod We Trust: The voltron sauce is so spicy it overpowers the flavor of the fish. 

Paletas: Best part. Tasted like a cookies and creme popsicle.

Seven Lives Tacos is better in flavor, quality and freshness of ingredients, and value!"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday evening around 7pm and it was quite packed! Luckily we didn't have to wait longer than 15 minutes.  We started with margaritas and tortilla chips with guac...delicious!  The corn was amazing!  My husband and I got the braised beef and lobster tacos...both were great! We ended the evening with churros...so so so yum! We'll definitely be visiting again! Food, drinks and service was great!"}
{"text":"I was up in Toronto on vacation and ate at this restaurant and was totally let down. I am from Southern California and we have fantastic Mexican food so I feel qualified enough to judge their food. I'm not a newbie to authentic Mexican food by any means. This restaurant had bad service, high prices, and the food was nothing to write home about.

The tortilla was soggy and flavorless and the meat was very gritty and seemed to be very cheap quality. I wouldn't not recommend this restaurant due to the prices paired with the quality of food. I would search elsewhere if you are looking for quality Mexican food."}
{"text":"WORST PLACE EVER! for these reasons:
1. Tried to wave down a waiter for 20min,  had to go to the front where I saw 2 waiters sitting talking to each other ignoring me. I asked \"do you work here?\". They replied \"yeah but were not working right now\". I asked \"so who do I order from\" at which one of the waiters begrudgingly got up and said \"I guess I can do it\"
2. No one offered or poured us water
3. When my tacos came out the meat was COLD
4. At the end they couldn't split the bill for 3 people
NEVER GOING HERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"To paraphrase a line from Pulp Fiction, La Carnita makes a pretty good taco, I dunno if they're worth $5, but they're pretty effing good.

I checked out La Carnita last night after running the Indy track for the YMCA run, so my hunger from my intense physical activity may have enhanced my dining experience.  I started off with the gordita, it had a nice crunch to it at first, but the meat was saucy and eventually made the tostada a bit soggy.  The pickled onion added a nice balance to the dish.  

The arctic char served on a tostada with corn was up next.  Nicely seasoned and the corn matched well with the fish.  A bit difficult to eat, I think serving this as a taco would have been a better choice.

The chorizo taco is your quintessential good taco.  It's the flavours, smell, & texture that instantly bring me back to my time eating tacos in Mexico.

At first I was offended by the use of Voltron in the naming of a fish taco sauce, leave my childhood alone!  But then I tasted it and that's where the magic happens.  The fish was nicely seasoned and evenly fried with just the right amount of batter.  The addition of the tartness of pickled cabbage with a sweet crunchiness of the apple and the background heat from the sauce ignites all areas of your tastebuds in a fantastic way.  The ingredients combine to become more than the sum of their parts, just like Voltron, so you get a pass on this one La Carnita!

I'm going to return to answer the question what $8 corn on the cob tastes like."}
{"text":"Worst tacos ever, don't waste your money here. I only give them the second star because the service was good."}
{"text":"I have been before and the food was awesome but tonight I came in early tonight, just as it opened, and the music was so loud, I had to leave. I asked twice, politely, if they could turn it down a bit (had to repeat myself twice because the first guy couldn't hear me), but the second guy refused to turn down the music. His reply: \"That is just the way it is here.\" As I was leaving another couple was yelling to one another about how the music was too loud. As I read over the reviews here, I see it's a routine complaint. If the purpose is to keep the \"old people\" out, I have some bad news: the 20somethings in my life have all told me they won't go back for the same reason. It's not a fun night, no matter how good the food, if you have to scream across the table at your friends and/or cannot hear a word they're saying back.

Bizarre.

Why wouldn't you want your restaurant to be conducive to dinner conversation? They were perfectly fine with my leaving, as well. I would have been a repeat customer but I will not return."}
{"text":"Went out with my girlfriends for a dinner date. The place isn't bad, but we couldn't be sat until all of us were there, the lighting is dim, as we were sat all the way at the back. They have a short menu. The food was good from what there was to choose from, but I didn't like the plating of the food. They lost points on presentation, in my book. It's a very casual place, so I could understand the platers, but in my books, it was not pretty to eat from.

We were celebrating our friends new jobs so we had shots to toast her, they were $12 each...ouch, that hurt my pocket. Great Tequila, but a lot of money for me to spend on alcohol...I'm not a big drinker.

I would return, but for a very casual meal. I'm a big fan of tacos, and there's are pretty good. I've had better, but La Carnita is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Guys, I've been back countless times since my last review and have to say La Carnita serves up the best Mexican in the city. It beats out Grand Electric and Playa Cabana. It's so good. Such a fun atmosphere and the food tastes great and is always consistent. I Iove their daily specials and the paleta (Popsicle-like) desserts. Great drinks selection and I always feel like my money is well spent. Service is friendly and fast too. I could go on, but I won't because you should really just stop reading this review and go eat there now!"}
{"text":"Food was just alright, chips and guac was good, but that isn't a difficult dish to make well. Didn't care for the tacos, but that is likely just my personal opinion because they were served cold. My main issue was that it took forever for us to get our bill. We were a group of 12 and our plates plates were cleared 30 minutes prior and we were holding our credit cards to pay. Would have though they would have wanted us out of there. We has to ask twice for the bill. Won't likely go there again."}
{"text":"Met just before 12pm for lunch and it got pretty busy by dessert time. It's bigger inside than it looks and really liked the decor. 
Went with the prix fixe menu $15.99 - includes choice of app, 2 tacos and dessert. Not all menu items are included. Got the chips and guac (app), Mexican chorizo and beef brisket (2 tacos) and a s'mores paletas (dessert). Portion size could have been bigger but since it was prix fixe we didn't feel overly full when we left. Tacos were good, soft shell and saucy. The paleta was so good!"}
{"text":"Great if you like overpriced Mexican food. The place is very nicely decorated, the staff was friendly, but as a Mexican, I would not go there to satisfy my craving for tacos."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Mexican restaurants in the city! Great atmosphere and the music selection is killer! The food is always delicious and their margaritas are great! Love love love it!"}
{"text":"It was good. But loud on a Friday!!
Everything was tasty. Presentation nice. Decor was cool. It's a hip place to hang out."}
{"text":"Ordered a Cod taco.   Best taco I ever tasted!  My husband said the same about the chicken taco.  Had the tres leche cake for dessert.  Fantastic!  Noisy but fun.  I will be back to try the other tacos."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Amazing food, excellent service, and the desserts are delicious! I keep going back because their quality of ingredients are great. The prices are a little expensive but I don't mind paying for it because of the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming. Started with a so so premixed margarita for $13 then had some ok tacos from the menu. Cool atmosphere in a great neighbourhood. It could be so much better tho."}
{"text":"Two words: FISH TACOS. Best I have had in the city by far. Worth the wait if the place busy. Personally I like La Carnita much more than Grand Electric."}
{"text":"Went to this place in july on a warn night, it was full inside so we decided on a table al fresco. Just as well, pretty load inside. clipboard girl told us she would call when the table was ready and that was great so we went to get a drink. 
The food was tasty, seasoned well and fun. would def go back."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing!  Wicked tacos friendly staff! The guys behind the bar are awesome! Come for the tacos and stay for the cocktails!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't really know what all the hype is.

My first impression was holy crap this place is cooooool and I REALLY wanted the food to be good.
But, it just didn't perform.  

The 'In Cod We Trust' taco was bland.
Crispy Advocado and Bean sounded so great.  What's in a name?
The Chorizo was the best of the bunch but still blah.

And, TORTILLAS?  Why can't Toronto seem to find a good tortilla supplier - honestly these tasteless pieces of pressed maseca aren't cutting it.

The micheladas were very good though and I think they put some sort of canned pickled jalapeno juice in them, which was a very nice touch.

Other than that, a place I've heard so much about and that seemed to have so much potential just didn't wow me.

They did give a limited edition print from the graphic artist/co-owner, which was a great idea and also a nice touch.  They've really got the decor and atmosphere down but they need to revamp the kitchen.  Unfortunately, with all the other taco places that are much better (El Asador, Playa Cabana, Seven Lives) I just probably won't be burned again at La Carnita."}
{"text":"I went to their John St. location for my birthday. We arrived for our 8pm reso at 8:05 and the unprofessional, dancing hostess who ignored me while standing right in front of her,had told 2 members of our party that we were lucky they didn't give away our table. 

We were escorted upstairs to our table, at the back of the restaurant, which would have been very comfortable and cozy if it weren't for the giant red heat lamp à la Kenny Rogers chicken Seinfeld episode. I'm not kidding- everything in an 8 ft radius of our table was red. I felt like I was eating in a photo developing room. It was so bad that my boyfriend had a migraine the rest of the night- or maybe that was the music. 

IT WAS SO LOUD THAT WE HAD TO TALK LIKE THIS. I'm not old (27) but I felt like a mom asking her kids to turn down that racket. It really stifled the conversation at our table.

The only positive about this place is the food; the pork belly special was the best taco I've ever had, fried cod was a huuuuge portion and equally tasty. 

My recommendation; go for lunch."}
{"text":"Ridiculous place. Food was terrible, so spicy you could barely taste anything, the music was so loud that you couldn't carry on a conversation, trying to hear the waiter with the attitude was impossible. I had a headache after 20 minutes of listening to screaming 90's rap. The absolute worst wine I've ever had - I'm sure they got it at The Wine Rack. And to top it off, for the attitude from the waiter and so so tacos, we got to tip him 18% because there were 8 of us. Never again."}
{"text":"Its a fun place, to try some funky food. Not quite authentic but you get a lot of taste and the unusual. Night special and best plate, spare ribs. Juicy and came off the bone. It's hard to speak of the taco, there just so much going on. You either enjoy it or you don't. The memorable  flavor Popsicles are fun and do actually taste of their description. It's a noisy crowd, service is cool and standoffish.  Pricing can be $40+ per person. So not cheap."}
{"text":"Seems like there are a few kinks to be worked out at this location. Food delivery was a bit rushed however all dishes were cold and tacos were brought out before appetizers. Bartenders were quite attentive but again, the margaritas were unbalanced with too much lime and no salt rim. 

Overall disappointed given the college location is consistently superb. I'd recommend sticking with that location."}
{"text":"The fish tacos were bomb! There were lots of other options, but if I could only go for one thing it would be these. 

Churros were good, but the guy on the corner of Dufferin and Bloor makes a better one."}
{"text":"If it was only about the food, I'd definitely go back.   It's tasty, fun, filling [albeit a bit rich].   But the music is way too loud.   Like WTF!? loud.   And I like noisy restaurants; they provide a busy fun atmosphere where your neighbour can only listen in if they TRY.   At La Carnita, the sound was so loud I just wanted to punch someone."}
{"text":"The 'Squid the Kid' tacos were the best I have ever eaten. 'In Cod we Trust' and the 'Beef Cheek' tacos were delicious too."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've been there 4 different times. Great tacos, fun atmosphere! My wife and I usually get every single taco and share. Allows us to get a taste of each one. I'm not into spicy food, La Carnita puts the perfect amount of heat into their tacos. I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I arrived at 6:30 pm on a Tuesday night and grabbed a seat at the bar for 2 right away.  I started off with a Bread and Butter cocktail and I was not impressed.  The mix of beer and lime juice, topped with a too salty rim was not my cup of tea.  We had the following tacos: fried avocado, cod, squid and pollo.  My favourite was the fried avocado.  I thought the beets were far too pickled with the cod and the pollo was well fried but the sauce did not go well with it.  Definitely pass on the tortilla chips as they were WAY too salty.  The meatballs were quite good.  The rice and corn fritters were bland.  Over all I was not impressed.  Dinner for 2, with drinks was just over $80.  Over priced and nothing impressive."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing environment, great vibe, and fantastic food.

I got the \"In Cod We Trust\", \"Pollo Frito\", and \"Tostada De Ceniche\". They were all so good!

We also got the \"Mexican Street Corn\" - phenomenal!

Finally I got the cookie cream ice cream. It was good, but a little too sweet for my taste.

Overall, definitely a 5-star experience. LOVED it."}
{"text":"Yummm! Love these tacos, really sad we moved out of the city just because we're so far from this place now!!! Pollo frito, oxtail tacos and the beef empanadas are my faves, you also MUST try the corn on the cob! Only downside is that the restaurant is SOOO small and line ups can get pretty ridiculous. I've gone a couple of times and have had to leave and go elsewhere just because of the wait times."}
{"text":"This review is pending for two weeks now, so fellow Yelpers, my apologies. 

My friend and I were deciding which Mexican restaurant to dine in on a Friday night. Granted my friend is a big foodie, and as usual I always don't judge his suggestions or recommendations. We were going to try out El Catrin, but instead we decided to go dine at La Carnita. 

This is my first proper Mexican restaurant in the GTA/Toronto area. I've been to few good ones in the US - primarily L.A., Las Vegas and Washington, DC. Upon entering, I was kind of overwhelmed with the atmosphere. It was more catered to a more \"younger\" crowd, and it was more of a trendy place, compared to the Mexican restaurants I've been to in the US. 

We were greeted by the hostess, and were given a high top table to sit at. That evening it was cold, and I was looking to see where we can place our jackets, since we sat on stools. Sure you could sit on your jacket, but some may oppose to it. We asked the hostess, and she kindly said that there are hooks under the table, and we can hang it there. I was impressed, as I've never come across this concept before. 

Okay - time to get to the food part. Right? I was glancing through the menu and my friend and I decided to order the tortilla chips with the 3 dips (guacamole, corn salsa and spicy bean & smoked queso). For the main course, or rather the tacos, I ordered to the crispy cotija. Mind you, I only ordered 1 of that, but I'll get to that later. We waited about 10 minutes for our tortilla chips and I must say - first impressions are always key. The presentation and portion was fantastic. If I wasn't feeling hungry that night, I probably would have had this only for dinner heh. The chips were frish, not stale. They were crispy, and they tasted great with the dips. All the dips were fantastic, and I tried resisting to pick the remaining dips with my fingers and to lick it. It was that good, but I didn't want to act like an animal, or should I say - a cave man. 

Onto the tacos themselves. Right, so like I said, I've never been to this kind of Mexican restaurant before, or rather where I've ordered tacos. I didn't know by ordering 1, I would only get one taco. I thought the tacos came in multiple quantities, but hey the price was too good to be true at $4.91 for this. I then ordered 2 more, to make it 3. Didn't have to wait long for it, and I just downed the tacos all at once. Yes I said all at once! I didn't even bother to care who was looking at me. I am a hungry dude, who needs to satisfy my stomach. I probably caved into my cave man instincts and just went haywire. To the point these were so good, I ended up ordering more. The server gave me a look, and told me that I should probably stop. I know he meant good, but I politely told him that I need MORE! No I am not a glutton, or at least I think I am. 

By the time I was done, I was satisfied, ensured my hands were no longer messy, and I gave out a semi loud burp. Probably the couple beside us would have heard it, but eh - who cares right? *shifts eyes*

Overall here's my ranking. The higher the number, the better. 

1) Ambiance - 3.5/5 - not a fan of the non well lit area, the music was kind of loud to have a conversation with. 

2) Food - 4/5 - not getting sick or not getting food poison is a good thing. 

3) Service - 5/5 - really friendly attentive staff

Would I come back here again - DEFINITELY YES. This time they better be prepared, because I will have a HUGE order. *Sigh* - one of the sins - gluttony... Errr, I take that back hehe."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant on College for a 30 something year old.

The vibe is awesome, the decor is worth mimicking, and of course the food is fantastic.

Try the Mexican street corn, whatever special is on that day (Esp the Sunday ribs), and any of the amazing desserts (I've changed my mind 3 times now as which is my favorite) 

Check it out, and be prepared to wait a bit if you get there after 6. However you can always leave your name and number, head to No One Writes to the Colonel for a drink and they will text you when the table is ready.

I almost forgot the great cocktails as well - have the margarita!

I wish the beaches location went through....

-repeat customer"}
{"text":"Cool little restaurant with a hipster vibe, but very friendly and approachable.

We were greeted and seated very quickly; our waitress was attentive and pleasant.
We split the chips with guacamole; I had a beef cheek and pollo frito tacos. The guac was good - although I prefer a more highly seasoned guac (this one is a bit mild) but my tacos were both really good. This is NOT your typical pub 'tex-mex' food, but it is still agreeable for those not sure they like Mexican food. The waitress suggested three tacos per person, which I found just right. The churros with warm caramel sauce were excellent, although a bit messy to eat.

The bill was delivered to us with a postcard - a tradition harking back to the establishment's earliest days. When La Carnita first opened (as a food stand, not a restaurant) they couldn't get a license to sell food - so they sold art (the postcards) that came with a free taco. Nice touch!"}
{"text":"What can I say about La Carnita? Well, their website describes it best as a place where \"street art meets street food\". This theme is very apparent when you look closely at the walls, where the artwork combines a multitude of gritty art styles to create what I would call a truly urban dining experience.

I decided to go with the In Cod We Trust, the Beef Short Rib Empanada, and the Beef Cheek Taco. The cod looked beautiful when it came out and was extremely crispy, but I found that it was a bit over seasoned. The beef empanada was definitely the most filling of the three dishes, and it was essentially a baked ball of beef with cheese. The outer shell just crumbled as you bite down, but the flavours found in this dish were very one dimensional - they could've added a few more ingredients to make it more interesting. Finally, we get to the beef cheek taco, which was my favourite dish of the night. It was a simple taco with a tender beef filling topped with jalapeno peppers and a sour cream sauce. As soon as I took a bite, I experienced the delicious taste of the savoury beef cheek. Soon after, my taste buds were hit with the spicy kick of the jalapeno peppers (which were actually not too hot because they didn't include the seeds). Pro tip - I found that I actually enjoyed the dishes more by squeezing a bit of lime juice over the top to ease the spice found in the peppers. Oh did I also mention that almost every taco comes with some form of jalapeno or habanero pepper? Watch out!

 I had a delightful experience at La Carnita and I enjoyed the food very much, but the one thing that bothered me was the staff did not seem too attentive and we received service that I thought was below average. The taco portion sizes were also pretty small so I would definitely fill up on the appetizers. Overall, I would say La Carnita offers a great social environment filled by interesting decorations that reflect their modern approaches to Mexican cuisine. However if you were looking for the most bang for your buck, I would consider going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very tasty! I couldnot get enough of the beef cheek tacos. The special was sold out which was unfortunate. Also the stairs at the entrance going up to the bar are against ontario building code. So watch your step."}
{"text":"I had been hearing many great things about La Carnita and because of that maybe the hype over did it for me. I will rarely wait longer than 30 minutes at a restaurant but because I was with friends and the conversation was good we waiting 2 hours and hoped it was worth it. I wouldn't wait that long again. 
I love the concept, the location and the restaurant design. The food service was great, prices are reasonable and the food is presented well. However for me it pretty much stopped there. What could have been an amazing meal was killed with the level of spice! 
I was with a party of 4, so we pretty much tried everything and none of us could handle it. (With the exception of the Ceviche) The over spicing ruined all the great flavours I was so excited for. The street corn was all right but having lived in Mexico I was expecting traditional Mexican corn off the cob which I like way better. The tortilla chips and 3 dips were also ruined with the over seasoning on the chips. The best part of the meal was the desert. The chocolate and peanut paleta left me droolling for more and the churros were done perfectly. 
I think La Carnita has the potential to be outstanding if they fine tune the seasoning a bit. Right now I think it's more a place to be seen, with some decent food at fair prices and it caters toward a hipster crowd more than foodies."}
{"text":"In Cod We Trust and Mexican Street Corn.  Closest thing to Heaven on a plate. They have 2 other locations downtown and on Queen East, which I've tried.  Always busy it seems and they don't take reservations but sip a margarita and chill while you wait - it's worth it."}
{"text":"The corn on the cob appetizer was apparently really good at our table but I personally didn't try it.  The cod taco is the best one although the beef cheek isn't bad. The chicken taco was dry and had a weird after taste. They suggested 3 tacos each, which is a good helping of food. The shells fell apart with how much topping on each taco. We ran out of chips on our appetizer but the guacamole is excellent. Overall, not a bad restaurant but there are better Mexican restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Went here with a few of my girlfriends on a Friday night. Of course the wait was 1.5 hours but we were able to snag a spot at the bar and order a pitcher of margarita (definitely not the best I've had) and order some chips and guac. The guacamole is really good.
We ended up being seated at a nice booth in the back. It's super loud in there, so be prepared to scream to hear one another.
We each ordered 4 tacos - a bit much as I couldn't finish my 4th one.  I ordered the cod which two of us agreed was the best. My friend thought the oxtail was the best (special of the night). I did not like the beef cheek as I thought the beef had a weird flavour. I liked the fried cheese one, but felt the beans overpowered the saltiness of the cheese so made it kind of bland.
The churros I thought were great, especially because of the caramel sauce that comes with it.

Super glad I finally got to check this place out as it's been on my list for a while. But I don't think it's worth a 1.5 hour wait (maybe try a week night if you're going to go) and I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Awesome meal!  I tried the avocado & mango salad, 3 tacos (fish, beans/avocado, chicken), chips & guac, and churros for dessert.  Everything was DELICIOUS.   The fish taco was my absolute favourite, and I'll definitely get the bean one again.  Might pass up the chicken next time just so I'll still be hungry enough to try another different one.  But all 3 were worth ordering again.  Higher priced than Grand Electric ($5 vs $3.50), but also a bit bigger I think.  

The chips and guac were good,  but nothing special.  I prefer the ones at Grand Electric.   The salad was awesome - sweet and salty and smooth and crunchy.  Churros were so authentic.

Music was a bit loud, making conversation a bit challenging (and my hubby always says \"if it's too loud, you're too old\", but in this case even he agreed).  Service was friendly and helpful, although there was a bit of confusion in some of the ordering.  We had to remind them of a few things.  

The atmosphere is great.  Very cool vibe, lots of room.  Similar food to Grand Electric, so I'm thinking this might help take the edge off the crazy waits and line-ups at Grand Electric, but hopefully without compromising either - they both deserve a place in this city!"}
{"text":"Pros - Delicious tortilla chips with three dips, fantastic Margarita pitcher, lovely warm churros for dessert

Cons - MUSIC IS FAR TOO LOUD. Honestly, I could hear maybe 10% of what my friend was saying to me from across the table due to the incredibly loud music. It really ruined the experience for me. The tacos and tostadas were only so-so. I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I am a big taco eater... This place has a great atmostphere, the decor is charming, some of the appetizers are good, but the tacos suck. 

My fish taco was completely inedible. Who puts cinnamon on fish? EW!

I do recommend having the corn, and the lingua tacos (if you are feeling adventurous). The popsicle was the best part of the meal, but I mean how hard is it to screw up a popsicle?

Anyways, if you feel like you have to try it, go ahead, but you've been warned."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out. Tonight was finally that night!

We got the tortilla chips with guacamole. The chips were baked with a hint of lime and some spice on top. It was really good and so was the guac. It also had some cheese and spice on top as well. There was a good amount of guac too.

Now to the tacos:

pollo frito: fried chicken taco: The presentation was great and I was excited to try it. However it was super bland.

crispy avocado & frijoles: The beans tasted fine but the avocados didn't taste crispy. This wasn't anything special either.

Overall the tacos didn't taste very special. The flavor was definitely lacking and I was disappointed. 

This ambience is great and definitely a place to go for a fun vibe. I wish I could give a higher rating but their tacos aren't worth it."}
{"text":"We had to wait but we just went to andy poolhall to kill some time. It was worth the wait though, the food is quick and delicious my only complaint would be portion size. Overall had a good time here."}
{"text":"Very hip atmosphere, amazing (loud) music, friendly and fast service.

I was originally drawn to La Carnita through their saavy lunchtime marketing campaign, and had my first opportunity to try the food at their Brickwork's UNO event. First impression - great tacos, but I'm the douche who waited in line for 45 minutes (albeit with a fun atmosphere and good music). I was immediately hooked and held out hope that there would soon be a permanent location. 

Lucky for me, it didn't take long! I've now had several opportunities to attend their College street location, and my standing favourites are the \"In Cod we Trust\" and the \"Lengua Tostada.\" Every taco has a unique taste palette with well-paired toppings, these are NOT the kind of tacos you want to slather in salsa and sour cream (the lengua literally melts in your mouth). Full of flavour and texture, I usually end up getting 3 at $5 each. Maybe not quite as cheap as that other taco place, but you do get a unique art print with every meal!

Oh, and the Mexican street corn, SO good! Overall great experience, and I've never had to wait in line - I usually head there around 5 or shortly after."}
{"text":"Margaritas were tasty but too much ice meant I was finished more quickly than I would have liked. Was excited to try In Cod We Trust, but a little disappointed - too little fish and too much hot sauce meant it was overwhelmed by the spiciness. The chicken taco was good - meat tender and flavourful, and the peanut sauce was amazing. Guac was OK but needed more lime, tomato and cilantro - was mostly avocado with cheese and spices on top. Churros were great - would get them again. Server was very friendly and attentive, atmosphere good if you are into the hipster vibe - me, not so much. Would be fun with a larger crowd. Not bad but not mind-blowingly good either."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I find it difficult sometimes to find a taco place with options that aren't bland and boring. La Carnita offers a really great vegetarian option called the crispy cotija, which you can easily make vegan by subbing the cheese for avocado (which is what I do). 

Their chips and guac are also literally the best I've ever had. I dream about it all the time. Both the dip and the chips are really tasty. Just a warning that the guac comes with some cheese on top which you can easily ask them to omit. They only have one vegetarian taco on their regular menu, which I would be more upset about if it wasn't really good. They do have another vegetarian option on a specific day of the week that I haven't tried since I never remember what day it is, I think it used to be a mushroom option but I believe last time I went it was a sweet potato option. I'm not really positive how often they change their daily specials menu. You definitely have a lot more choice here if you're not a vegetarian or vegan. 

They lose stars for service, price, and that now infamous instagram post. The service isn't particularly friendly and I think that a lot of the menu items are overpriced for the size. I also think that the drink menu is expensive. I ordered a mixed drink once and it was very tiny at a whopping 12 bucks. I also find it really odd that they can only split the bill in equal amounts among the table and not by items."}
{"text":"The churros, worth it just for the caramel and sugar laced churros. The ambience is meant to look like 90s Chicano subculture with latin graffiti and neon lights. It's a bit hipster, but worth it for the deserts alone"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party, the table wasn't ready so we were invited to have drinks at the bar. Really nice service, timely food and knowledgable and friendly staff.

Ordered the fish tacos and had some drinks and churros at the end.

Will be coming back again."}
{"text":"Not usually a fan of the hipster scene but the great service, affordable price point and very flavourful food at La Carnita begs for a return.

In Cod We Trust is everything that everyone else is saying. Also enjoyed the Rice & Corn Frituras. Well done!"}
{"text":"Very very disappointing. Pretentious and overpriced. Food is mediocre, about $5 a taco, and they are nothing special. We ordered a pitcher of sangria which was $55 and we only got 4 small glasses out of it because they put so much ice. The waitresses are rude and they don't spilt the bill which makes paying such a hassle. All that could be overlooked if the food was amazing but unfortunately it was not. I will not be returning nor recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Yummy! Because of the heat wave today while meeting my friend I insited we have somewhere with air con. He suggested here. I loved the three dips we shared and my fried guacamole taco. The cocktails were also divine (try that margarita!). However, my buddy ordered the steak one, and while the waiter claimed it was 'medium rare' (I'm a vegetarian so I have no idea) my friend took a photo of it and send it to his friend whose a professional chef and he said it was BLUE rare, as in practically bleeding. Icky. He didn't eat it with the meat. LONG wait (sit at the bar have a drink) our dips came in 15 minutes (after we'd waited about an hour for the table- but the place just opened, you can also sit at the bar and have a drink) but our tacos (which considering they are TINY and i had one and my friend had two) took well over an hour. My friend also like his churros, just don't expect to be fed fast, though i'm sure this will change when the hype about the place dies down. I'll go back. Just not in the next couple weeks when everyone is dying to get in.

It's also super loud so not a good first date place."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! From the starters to desert, I enjoyed every morsel.

I have had and would recommend: grilled corn, pork tacos, mango and avocado salad, cerviche, and churros. The prices were more than reasonable for the quality of food. Both times I've been, I succumbed to temptation and ordered more than I originally planned.

I've been twice. The first time was on a Friday. I had a bit of a wait (maybe thirty minutes?). The restaurant is long, deep, and noisy. A serene dining experience it is not. The second time I arrived early on a weeknight. Sat at the window, soaked in the sun, and enjoyed it much more. But I'm one of those curmudgeons who doesn't equate noise with atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ridiculously overpriced drinks.

Food is overpriced too considering there is always a huge crowd and the portions are so small and mediocre.

Service is great, however, and the decor is AMAZING."}
{"text":"I must say I am quite disappointed in my experience at La Carnita. I visited the John street location with two of my friends on Saturday September 26th. We arrived at the restaurant around 8pm and added our names to the waitlist of which was expected to be anywhere from 30-45minutes. We decided to go next door to the Fox and Fiddle to get a drink in the meantime.Ten minutes after we sat down at the Fox we received a call from La Carnita. We missed the phone call by 1 minute and had called back immediately... no answer. Worried that we would miss our reservation we cancelled our drinks and rushed back over to the restaurant only to be met by a very rude hostess who said she had called us by accident. Without even an apology we were made to feel blamed and told that we should have answered when they called, or should have at least called back. I explained to the hostess that we in fact did call back and no one answered... to which she shrugged and asked us if we would like to keep our name on the list. We did. Unfortunately, this impolite hostess was just the beginning of our unpleasant experience.

Once we were seated we seemed to have two waitresses running back and forth and from the time we ordered our drinks and food, three different meals were brought to our tables - none of which we ordered. The servers appeared to be frazzled and confused running in circles. At one point I had to repeat my order to our waitress who seemed preoccupied by another staff member's conversation a table over. Sadly my friends' pork cheek was frozen solid in the middle and when we informed our waitresses she stuck her finger in it and took it back. My friend was charged for the taco none the less.

Throughout the entire experience we were still gracious and polite. However, what I think would have been the courteous way to handle all of this would have been to simply apologize - from the very beginning. From when the hostess accidentally called us to rush back to when the waitress served us the frozen taco. A simple apology goes a long way and would have been greatly appreciated. Due to the unfriendly nature of the staff, the careless treatment of guests and disorganization my friends and I will never return to La Carnita on John street but do hope the other locations live up to their reputation."}
{"text":"Good food, OK service and overpriced. Sangria pitcher is filled with ice and it costs $55.

The pitcher costs you more than the individual glass and as per the manager the reason is that they put more alcohol in the pitchers. This seems funny  to me. Basically if you order the individual Sangria then you are getting less alcohol ?!

Anyhow we felt cheated and the manager didn't care much. At the end she reduced our bill by $10 after we complained about the pitcher being filled with ice so much, instead of Sangria"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and found all the food really delicious, the service was friendly and a good atmosphere. Their margaritas are fantastic and not too sweet, and I particularly loved the ceviche tostada. Yum!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere but not so much of the service. We found a strand of hair from one of our tacos. These things happen we understand. But when we addressed it to the server, we got no apology but just a standard \"I'll take it off the bill\". Ruined our night with his attitude."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner her on Friday night! The atmosphere was perfect with the old school hip hop blasting. The drinks were excellent and guac was fresh. We had great service and really enjoyed it there. Only con would be the tacos - they were good but the protein was deep fried which took away from the flavours. Definitely a great place for evening drinks and dip!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the tacos are always fantastic.  There are about 5 standards, plus a rotating taco of the day.  Beef cheek, ceviche, cod, and pollo frito are all amazing, with big bold flavours.  I also tried a mango salad that was just OK, but really, you're not thinking of coming here for the salad are you?  

Service has been spotty on my visits: sometimes knowledgeable and prompt, other times amateurish and disorganized (eg. served a salad with no plates or cutlery on the table, and had to ask 3 times to get them).  

I've only been on weekends, and it is loud.  Like, really effin' loud. I don't mind that, but some of the people I've dined there with didn't like it.  If you're planning a conspiracy and need a place to whisper, this might not be your best bet.  But if you're in an energetic mood and want a loud, raucous dinner with great food, then you've got a good spot."}
{"text":"Their Tortilla chips and guacamole (great amount of garlic) are amazing. 

You can't go wrong with any of the tacos but the Pollo Frito tacos are my absolute favourite due to the contrast the crispy batter adds and the sweet and spicy nature.

The peanut covered chocolate Paleta is the best dessert I've had so far but the Churros are also great.

Place is usually very busy so just a heads up."}
{"text":"Reason i gave it two stars is because of location and ambience. but to be honest the food was horrible!! I know this might be confusing because everyone is always talking about this place or posting amazing pictures. I too was so looking forward to this restaurant but its not worth the hype in my opinion. Been to better mexican restaurants. Try el catrin if you are looking for similar vibe with good food.

Here i had the mexican street corn and the cod fish tacos. Both were not even just decent but actually pretty bad that I did not even finish it:( not sure if i went on a off day but i will not be returning

Oh and the drinks were $12 and barely had any liquor in it. evenwhen i brought this up to my server he didnt do anything about it."}
{"text":"Dinner: Amazing food - I've had the fish tacos and the mushroom taco and found both to be excellent, have returned several times for more! I finished dinner with a popsicle (house made and AMAZING).

Brunch: Terrible. First, I asked for tea which they don't have (who doesn't have tea while serving brunch?). Then, there was only a single item that I could eat as a pescetarian - the Scrambled eggs taco. It was very simple, just eggs, avocado, and hot sauce - I definitely could've made it at home. When it came, the taco shell was dry and the scrambled eggs didn't seem to have any added flavouring. I did like the sliced chili peppers on top, but I'm not a fan of avocado, which they just sliced and laid on top of the eggs. Very disappointing, considering how much I love the dinner there.

I'd give them a 4 star review for dinner, but a 1 star for brunch."}
{"text":"These tacos are amazing ! I have been twice now and I love the food and the atmosphere. 

The tortillas are great not dry at all. Pretty authentic in my opinion. 

The toppings are amazing, full of flavour. I had the ceviche tostada, beef cheek, carnita and in cod we trust. All amazing. The carnita which has pork in it was probably my favourite. But they were all so amazing it was hard to choose. 

I also had the tres leeches cake which was good but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to order again because I wasn't crazy about the cherries on top. 

I will def come back time and time again !"}
{"text":"The food is great - the fish tacos are delicious but  the portions are small and slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"Good food. Good music. Good atmosphere. We had the tortilla chips with quac (NOM!), the beef cheek taco and the cod taco. The tacos were decent but was really won us over were the Paletas! I had the key lime pie flavour and my friend has the cookie monster. To die for. I'll be back La Carnita!"}
{"text":"Great food. Order the corn, you wont regret it! I thonk I have tried alll the tacos at this stage, braised beed and in taco we trust are good! Gew locations around the city and they are busy busy on weekends.they do however take your number and message you when your table is ready so you can sample some booze near by."}
{"text":"The food is great. 4 or 5 stars. The location is also amazing with TIFF around the corner and sweet Jesus next door. 

The service though. Waiting to order. Waiting for water. Waiting for cutlery. Waiting for your bill and then waiting to pay. What should be a 45 minute meal turns into an hour and a half. And in the evenings the music is so loud that you can't even enjoy the company during all the waiting."}
{"text":"Yay! I love those tacos! My favourites are vegeterian and fish. My BF loves the chicken one, but I honestly find it quite spicy. Drinks are delicious as well. 
It gets very busy in the evening, so DO NOT expect good (or fast) service. 
It's also VERY loud :)"}
{"text":"A great place to go with friends. Great atmosphere, pretty delicious tacos  and attentive service. With some of the tacos, you basically can only taste the toppings and hardly the main ingredient, but still delicious."}
{"text":"This review is for the spanking new east side location! Welcome to the hood ! Food was better then awesome and our server was on point all evening. ( almost better then the tacos... Almost!)
Our only beef was then bitter end. We get that 3 separate bills are annoying but at least itemize the bill so everyone can see  what they individually owe and we're not all breaking out calculators dividing  5 pollo taco, 3 tuna, cauliflower, beef cheek etc. This makes for a really awkward end to a really great evening with friends when everyone's trying to figure out who owes what. There's an app for that ! Will go back for sure ...other then  that."}
{"text":"Very creative and delicious. That Voltron sauce is some good shit. The place has a hip hop vibe."}
{"text":"Really good! love the decor of the place. The mexican street corn, ceviche and crispy avocado & frijoles was to die for! My friend had the avocado mango salad and tostada de lengua and he loved it. We also really liked the print that you get when you pay your bill. Fun concept."}
{"text":"La Carnita has always been amazing, but it's like they took everything unique and good about it and left it behind. For starters, the namesake taco is no longer on the menu and the amazing beef cheek is now a normal steak taco easily made at home with an old El Paso kit. Second, they no longer do the graphic prints with each meal. Also, stay away from the tuna cerviche. It'll make you sick."}
{"text":"I went to La Carnita with a friend on a weekday around 6 pm and we got seated right away. The staff here is very attentive and happy to give you some advice or recommendations about their menu. And the food gets to the table fast, so you won't be hungry for long. 

The food is amazing. Here's what you should order:

- Tortilla Chips (we got all 3 sides, but we should have just ordered the Guacamole)
- Beef Cheek Taco
- Ceviche Taco
- Fish Taco (Cod)
- Chorizo / Spicy Sausage Taco

They also have a good range of serious hot sauces, which I was very happy about. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I've only had great experiences here since they opened a few months ago. Before opening their permanent location at college & palmerston, la Carnita had only appeared at as a pop-up and at TUM (or Toronto Underground Market). 

Long story short, come here for the Mexican Style Grilled Corn (hv some floss on hand for those stubborn bits that get stuck between your teeth), tacos (whatever sounds good on the menu AND the special, whatever it may be it'll be good), and churros. 

The churros are insanely good. $5 will get you 3 sticks sitting in a chinese teacup of cajeta (Mexican dulce de leche). I've come often enough that they know how i like my churros...served with a spoon. HAHA :D That way, I can attempt to discretely lap up the rest of the cajeta-- so delicious. 

Their paletas are quite special as well because the flavours change constantly."}
{"text":"I've tried la Carnita a bunch of times now and I can say that I definitely found my new favourite Mexican place.
It's really hard for me to say what I like the most because hem... I like everything that have! Ihih
I really enjoy their margaritas though, nice and fresh and not too alcoholic so you can enjoy the food and not getting wasted and spoil it before the end of the dinner."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience, loved the interior and food was tasty!
Just go, you'll know what I mean."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I can't get enough. Their roasted corn, tacos and dulce de leche cake are one of a kind!!! The food is tasty and prices reasonable. It's loud and fun. Don't go if you're in the mood for a quiet dinner."}
{"text":"La carnita has been on my list as one of the mexican places in Toronto to try. It is a really small restaurant with a chill environment. 

Service was exceptional. Our waitress was helpful and informative. She was always round whenever we needed to order more food and drinks.

We got the chips with guacamole to start. It was good but nothing amazing as I had better gucamole. For my main I got the squid the kid taco special and the carnita taco. Tacos are small but man are they really delicious. My favourite was the squid. So if you go, go on a tuesday. 

For dessert I got the vietnamese coffee paleta with coconut, as I am vietnamese. Sorry but there was nothing vietnamese about this. But the coconut did go well with the coffee flavour. 

I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'll cut to the chase - extremely rude server, slow service and cold tacos. I've visited the other two locations on many occasions and have been nothing short of impressed - great food/service.

Do yourself a favour, don't visit this location. Ever."}
{"text":"Favourite Mexican restaurant in Toronto. Chips and guac, corn on the cob and cod tacos are my go to. I seriously dream of the corn on the cob!!! Absolutely delicious. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Simply Awesome. 

The service was great. The margaritas aren't too sweet. The avocado and mango salad is fresh and very flavourful. The street corn is cooked perfectly and the spice level was perfect. The ceviche taco is perfectly balanced and reminded me of Mexico. The  churrros are very authentic and not too heavy. I highly recommend going often."}
{"text":"With all the hype surrounding this new midtown spot, I've visited twice since it opened with two different groups of friends and both times ended in a very disappointing experience. 

Service is okay but both the specialty drinks and food here are more than forgettable. In fact, our last visit left us wishing to forget the food but we couldn't, at least for the 24 hours in which we were sick from really bad fish tacos (they were definitely off). The manager reluctantly pulled them from our bill but not before lecturing the table that fish tacos were meant to be very fishy. Well I guess the hundreds of fish tacos I've had previously weren't the real deal...

Thankfully there are GOOD options for authentic Mexican fare at Yonge and Eg like  Marriachis -- a family run restaurant. 

Won't be back and recommend you avoid it too unless you like your fish tacos, well, fishy."}
{"text":"Love the food and drinks here, but service is curt and unfriendly. Prefer the other location by a long shot."}
{"text":"This will be short and sweet. I have been here 4 times...all walk ins amd once for a birthday party of 10. Although the service is shoddy, ive enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  I have also recommended this place to numerous clients and friends.  I wanted to take clients here and called the day before to make reservations.  I was busy and did not have time to check the website, where eventually after leaving 3 messages I did and realized they do not take reservations.  I had expressed the importance of having someone call me back in case I had to make alternate arrangements.  They could not extend the basic courtesy to return my call and let me know they did not take reservations.  I get that you are busy now and don't think you owe your customers anything,  but fads pass and there are many other taco joints (lets face it) popping up all over the city that are just as good. I for one will not return, nor will I recommend your establishment to anyone.   Do not take your customers for granted."}
{"text":"This spot is just flat out cool. Visited Toronto for the first time and wanted to find some cool places downtown. Stumbled upon this place and was really surprised. The vibes inside are incredible, with a dim lit atmosphere and great music. The tacos were slightly overpriced for the size of them, but they tasted absolutely delicious. Also, the margaritas were pleasantly different with a certain spice to them. If you don't mind spending a little more for a cool Mexican spot, definitely stop by La Carnita."}
{"text":"Food is sooooo good ....but the service? Terrible. Servers would rather chat with friends or be on cell phone so be prepared to wait for anything. And don't get me started on the whole one bill thing they insist on having. Out of annoyance I don't go here as often as I would. Great job keeping a useless rule that annoys customers to the point of not wanting to return. 



Oh and a pitcher is $60. LOL."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE La Carnita. 

The food is fantastic the drinks are strong and they are ALWAYS consistent. 

I have had all of the tacos, the Mexican street corn, the 3 dips and chips and the popsicle. EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS.

The only downside is the servers can be kind of slow and the music can be SO LOUD. I am 23 and saying this. It almost hurts your ears and forget about having any sort of convo."}
{"text":"Super quick service. Tacos are $5 a pop but I only needed two for a pretty decent meal. The mango soda is ridiculously good."}
{"text":"I went there because a friend suggested it. I must say the server Vanessa was the epitome of rudeness. She messed up our order and when we told her about it she give us this horrible attitude. The manager Mario was very nice and did his best to apologize and to rectify the problem.
The food was actually good, but I will never go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night and we were seated almost right away. We were seated upstairs at a small table for two (which we didn't mind). The only downside was that we were right beside the waiters station so the bus boys could be a bit noisy at times. 

We started with the street corn and it is absolutely amazing, I would highly recommend getting it as a starter. Since we were also planning on getting dessert I only ordered two tacos (which I found very filling). Personally I enjoyed the In Cod We Trust the most, plainly put it was simply delicious. For dessert we got the churros, and I highly recommend upgrading your order and getting 4 instead of the usual 3. They were most definitely the best thing we ordered that night, and 4 makes splitting the order easier.

The biggest downfall was that once we had finished our meal and dessert we had to wait about 15-20 minutes for our waitress to get us our bill. I found this a bit surprising since it was extremely busy and we figured they would want to clear us out to make way to seat the next group. 

Overall though I would highly recommend giving it a try, the food definitely won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Another garbage Toronto hipster taco joint. Very overpriced, very disapointing. Don't waste your hard earned money."}
{"text":"Damn good and interesting tacos -- and being from San Diego, I can say they would be considered very good even by our home standards.

We ordered two plates of the 3 dips (might have gotten away with 1), and shared 12 tacos and one daily special amongst 8 people and no one went home hungry. They warn you that the tacos are small, but I actually found them a bit large. 2 per person with the appetizer dips is plenty (unless your ravenous).

The funny part was that with a crowd of 8 at our table, there was a whole mix of what each person considered the best items on the menu, with everyone really enjoying the food overall (My call would be any of the beef cheek, cod, or pollo tacos).  A nice spicy kick in each item, but not overly spicy, and definitely fresh, made to order items (rather than pre-made blah food).

Nice vibe and decor, with the only negative being that the music is QUITE LOUD. HONESTLY, THEY COULD TURN IT DOWN A FEW DECIBELS, hint, hint.

This ain't no Taco Bell (and good riddance :-)."}
{"text":"The food was good.. but the servers were so dense and inattentive. Was also a little surprised when at the end of the night they gave our table of 10 a communal bill and told us to figure it out."}
{"text":"I am so in love with La Carnita! I went for Sunday brunch with a bunch of friends and I was blown away by how delicious the food was. And pleased by the prices too.
I had the scambled egg taco and the crispy chicken torta- the flavours were truly spectacular and I am recommending this place to everyone. We also indulged in churros and paletas after. Yum. My friends all enjoyed the dishes they tried too. 
I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite place to go for tacos to date. I'll be honest, I don't see the hype for tacos, they're whatever to me. I've tried tacos from places in the GTA that I hear to be very popular but i've never seen the big deal. Came here with my boyfriend and already I loved that they had so many different options to choose from, we got four different tacos and we shared them all between us two. We also got the mexican corn which was super filling itself (comes with 2 huge corn cobs in one order $9). Tacos get very boring to me, so I like that you don't have to down three beef tacos of the exact same toppings in one order. The food was all amazing. Some were sweet, some were pungent, some were spicy, some were a mix of everything- it was fantastic. Service was great as well, high recommend!"}
{"text":"All the food was really good but some tacos were more flavorful than others, esp the pollo frito. Loved the Mexican street corn appetizer! Drinks were very good - the AstroTurf was fresh, but there are better Micheladas elsewhere. Once again, happy to see Dillons Gin and Bitters. We shared the Key Lime Pie paleta (Popsicle) and churros - a very yummy finish to the meal. Service was great!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times already. As a taco fan, I've obviously been to seven lives and grand electric as well. So I don't really want to compare them, as they each as their own take on food. 

La carnita is a pretty chilled space, pretty dark inside with reasonable loudness of music. After many visits, my favourite tacos are cod and beef cheek. Their nachos dip as a starter is nice with a bigger crowd. margaritas are great. But the most mind blowing food item I've had here is their ribs. It's on their special menu and is only offered on Sundays. It was one of the best smoked ribs I've ever had. It's the perfect smokyness, falling off the bone with a spicy mexican sauce. Just a MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Terrible management of tables on a busy Friday night. A 45 minute wait turned into a 2 hour wait, only to be given perhaps the worst table possible (up front in the windows. Told it would be an another hour to get to sit inside with the rest of the diners. Well, instead I went to Grand Electric, was told I had a 45 minute wait, and they were accurate to the minute. Great tacos, too."}
{"text":"Came here last week with some friends and I had the bbq corn to start which had a delicious sauce on it.  I also had the steak and the cod tacos - the cod was super tasty but I thought the steak one was a little bland.  I did find the music a little aggressively loud but Im also getting a bit older so it just may be me :)  Overall a solid experience"}
{"text":"Second visit here. First time there was an electrical short that almost resulted in a fire from tge sound system. All of the staff gathered around the area of the short without concern for the guests.

This time we went in on way to a TIFF film at lunch. Place was nearly empty and host pointed to a narrow univiting table near entrance saying they are full and have reservations.

Even though their food wasnt bad when we nearly got electrocuted, i will pass on the attitude.

If you are the owner and care about your reputation, train your staff better. We found a great Thai place down the street that really was nearly full and th
ey were friendly and helped us find a table.

I will never go to La Carnita again and it has nothing to do with the chef/food!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the crowd and the friendliness of the staff. They have a lunch menu for around $20 which is impressive and comes with an appetizer and choice of two tacos and dessert. Loved the interior of the restaurant. There was ample seating and space for all tables and our waitress was super informative and nice. 

The nachos were nothing special but I loved the guac and the salad was alright. I think the tacos were the real highlight. Felt fresh and bursting with flavour. There were so many options I wish I could go back to try them all. 

The paletas were also excellent (from Sweet Jesus downstairs) and they were definitely worth it just on their own. I would go back to try more tacos and paletas. 

Overall great experience for a nice lunch to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  My family and I came down here on my cousin's suggestion, and we were all impressed.  I give this place five stars for the food, and four stars for the atmosphere.  I would suggest sharing a few of the appetizers and then having one or two burritos.  Definitely try out the Mexican Street Corn and Avocado Mango Salad.  As for the burritos, I tried the chicken mole one (Pollo Frito) and wasn't overly impressed.  I did try a bit of my cousin's In Cod we Trust, and would order that next time.  The desserts were amazing, especially the churros.
The only thing that I would caution against, is the (very) loud music.  After reading a few of the reviews, we choose to wait for the patio spot to have a quieter spot to carry a conversation.  This place is very popular, and was packed and very loud inside.  While the food is top-notch, be prepared to speak loudly and have a bit of a hard time hearing your friends/family/date!"}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars but they do NOT take reservations. I find the turnover to be quite quick for two or three people, bigger parties usually wait longer but their bar is welcoming to big parties waiting for tables.

The food...
I cannot say enough good things about the food. Consistently delicious. I highly recommend the roasted corn to start - best ever in my opinion! - and trying the Cod tacos, it is lightly battered with a nice crunch. All of their tacos have incredible savoury texture and colour! All the more appetizing. Their portions are JUST right. Their tacos cost from $4+, so you and a friend can order which ones you want and they'll bring them out all at once - the servers will explain which one is which to help you prepare your palette! - You're never SO full, it leaves you very satisfied without the complaint \"I'm still hungry\". Now if you're like me and love desserts, their dessert menu is unreal! Like their entrees, well portioned and just enough to satisfy. Their paletas are fun to eat and they have seasonal flavours, which is always nice to look forward to when I visit. Their dessert empanadas are my 2nd favourite :)

The Staff...
Helpful, knowledgeable, friendly! The first time we went, our server helped explain portions and describing what to expect from the entrees. Mind you there is a 2 hour dining limit, but we were not, nor felt rushed at all! Bar service is quick with delicious drinks :) 

The Atmosphere...
Dark, and finely lit (if that makes sense). Bustling (always busy). Awesome music (90's-00's hip hop). Loud-ish setting (wasn't yelling at my friend sitting across from me).  I like it :) 



Would HIGHLY recommend. Eat well friends!"}
{"text":"All show... No go. The food is overspiced, over sauced and inauthentic. Churrors were overcooked and hard. Grilled fish taco was ok but the ceviche taco was a drippy disaster and served on a hard tortilla - mess!  There are plenty of authentic Mexican restaurants in Toronto far better. This place is all about the decor and music but has no substance."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place two stars is because the location and physical space are stylish, a reclaimed historical building which I really enjoyed...the rest kind of went down the shitter.

I went to La Carnita to wind down with my co-workers on a Friday night. The place was full, but that is normal for a Friday night downtown location. There were multiple servers and no one seemed to be rushing around or seeming too busy.

The food was ok, I've had MUCH better Mexican in the city. Playa Cabana or Wilber's kick this place out of the park, easily. I was ok with this, it didn't matter too much if the food itself was perfect. I'm satisfied if the nachos do their thing.

My group of three had been there for a while, having drinks and food and acting in a regular patron demeanor. Nothing rambunctious or out of the ordinary. As the time for the cheque to come arrives, my co-worker expresses that she would like to take care of our appetizers. The waitress responds that they do not split bills. 

As someone who has their fare share of serving experience inclusive of knowing their way around a POS system, this makes no sense to me. Splitting bills requires a touch of a finger on the POS, and for the most part your customers will remind you how they would like it split if you weren't preemptive enough to start a tab by splitting the bills at the start of the night and then combining them if someone at the table offers to cover the tab. It will save you having to work things out later, and makes you come off as a much more impressive and experienced server. It's serving 101. 

La Carnita will gladly take multiple credit cards or debit cards for the same bill, so long as you sit there doing the math yourself they are ok with this. So weird, what is the difference between this and just splitting out bills? I inquired kindly as to why this is the case, stating nicely that I know how easy it is to split on a POS. Rather than a polite \"i'm sorry, this is just our policy\" I received a snippy backhanded response of \"it's also easy to do yourself on your calculator.\" 

\"What's next?\" I thought. \"Should I go back into the kitchen and cook the food myself because it's easy enough to do? Maybe we should just get rid of servers all together and go pick up the food at the pass ourselves? Oh but of course, don't forget to tip them for all YOUR hard work....weird right? 

As she walked away passive aggressively, we were upset and frustrated. After a few drinks, no one wants to sit there dividing and multiplying a non-itemized bill that clumped all our beers together etc... Like I said, if I wanted to do the work myself, I would have eaten at home and tipped myself.

After a full half an hour, the waitress is no where to be seen. We went to the bar to ask if someone could please take our payment. The bartender came over to take our cards. We were never apologized to for the wait, rather when our calculations were lost in our phones by the time he arrived, he acted frustrated that we had wasted his time to walk over when we were not ready with our bill divisions. When we asked him to please wait a minute and expressed that we have never been passed off like this at a restaurant, he told us that the restaurant did not require our patronage and did not care if we returned. We felt virtually laughed out of a restaurant where we were hoping to have a great night. After finally paying, the waitress leans over the bar and waves to us like a passive aggressive snob saying \"have a great night guys\" across the restaurant. I felt like we were being bullied by our waitress. WTF?

When we were heading out we found the manager and tried to explain calmly how flustered we were. He could not have cared less, he exhibited the same attitude as the waitress. He would not let speak out part, even though we took great care to stay calm and collected as we explained the situation. He went as far as putting his hands right in my friends face further aggravating us.

Needless to say, I was appalled by this restaurant. La Carnita is not a 5 star restaurant, so what ever makes them think they can treat patrons this way is beyond me. Judging by subsequent reviews on Yelp, this is not the first time customers were dismissed like garbage and the service was below average. I'm sure people have had a fine time there and maybe not every server will provide such a low calibre experience, but between this waitress, the bartender and the manager all sharing a similar vibe I felt that this theme of low brow service and \"we're better than you attitude\" run consistently through the joint.

I'm sure you can have a great time, just don't ask them to go above and beyond and do something totally crazy like split a bill. Or just find a better place for Mexican, I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is not as highly rated as it should be. A relaxing evening is typified by soul hugging Mexican food and drinks. This establishment offers this service."}
{"text":"Really good, about tied with Grand Electric for tops in the city."}
{"text":"I have come here a couple times and for the most part it's a good experience and fun crowd. Food it quite tasty and very filling. My preference is the beef cheek taco and the chicken taco.

Place is always busy so don't expect to be seated right away - worth the wait though. Good music!"}
{"text":"Dropped by La Carnita on a Wednesday night at about 8:30pm. Place was pretty full but thankfully we were seated right away! I've been wanting to try this place since they're known for their delicious tacos and I definitely enjoyed them! Their open faced tacos were well dressed and full of flavour (although one of them was a bit too spicy for me). 

This place has daily specials ranging from tacos to ribs. We had \"In cod we trust\", a classic fish taco which was quite good, \"pollo frito\" a yummy crispy chicken thigh taco, and \"carnita\" pork confit taco. My favorite would be the pork carnita taco! It was quite flavourful, a bit spicy and I guess I just really liked the guacamole and mango salsa combined with the soft pork confit. It kinda reminded me of pulled pork but not really lol. 

Two tacos each plus guacamole with chips starter was quite filling and regular. Other tables had mexican street corn which just looked like some pretty yummy seasoned & grilled corn on the cob, but I wasn't really feeling it. 

Atmosphere is quite dark with loud music. I felt like I was yelling at my friend every time we talked to each other. Maybe I was sitting beside the speakers :P 

All in all, the tacos are pretty good, decent sized as expected and I'd probably go again to try some of their other tacos (like beef cheek?), but maybe sit outside on the patio (when its warm and) where the music is not as loud :)"}
{"text":"For the attitude that you will get from the staff, the food is nahhhht so worth it. 

We put our names down for a table and once we got a message that our table is ready, we went to the hostess to get seated. Yet after that, it was still a 30 minute wait for some reason. 

The server had a lot of attitude, did not want to accommodate the smallest requests (ie allergies) and was not apologetic about it. 

If you want to order a drink off the menu, they only give you half of the drink. So odd. 

I usually don't bother commenting on the service but the food does not justify the awkwardness that you will experience."}
{"text":"We came here on Thanksgiving weekend Sunday, so it was quiet. Service was great. Music was a bit loud though. Food was fantastic and prices were reasonable. I'm not sure what it's like during peak times because it always seems so busy, but I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Delicious cod tacos -- fried to perfection. Wish they had more vegetarian options for tacos."}
{"text":"Like all the previous, these are great tacos. The specials of the day were beef tongue which was most, crunchy, and paired great with the piquant sauce.

The tortilla chips and do we had to start were not bad, and the dips were clearly supposed to be the highlight but definitely nothing amazing. Still, not many options for sharing appetizers.

Expect 3 tacos to run you around $15.

They also have 40s, in case you want to play Edward forty hands..."}
{"text":"I had been dying to go here for months and my friend finally took me for my birthday. The food is delicious! I'm not a huge fan of fish but I thoroughly enjoyed \"in cod we trust\". The crispness of the fish complimented the other softer toppings in the taco and I must say it was my favorite taco of the night. My friend  and I also ordered the beef cheek (a must for us) and it was excellent as well. I ordered the ceviche but wasn't a huge fan of it...I ended up not finishing it. The table beside us recommended the churros but they were okay... The churros themselves didn't really taste fresh and the caramel sauce that comes with the churros was a little watery... But overall, it was great food and great drinks (try one go their mojitos...!!!)!"}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place and wanted to book for a big group for my birthday. I called to make a reservation and nobody answered, so I left a message. Nobody got back to me, so I emailed them. Again, no response. I called another 8 times on different days and times. Still nothing. I guess they don't care for my business. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and tracks with a touch of hipster. Service could have been better and the food just ok.

Surprise stand out was the Pollo Frito (crispy chicken thigh, peanut mole, honey, Rossy's hot sauce, green cabbage, and salsa fresca). Wasn't impressed with the other tacos however the choritzo meatballs had the perfect amount of spice and cheese- try it!

For dessert, only paleta's are served. If you're looking to try their infamous Sweet Jesus lattes and ice cream cones, you'll have to wait in line next door.

Will give this place another shot."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere upstairs. The In Cod We Trust might be my new favourite fish taco. The Tostada de Ceviche also a winner if you like the spice of habanero. Yum!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what people are raving about. The guacamole was almost flavourless, the fish tacos were literally dripping with grease and the chorizo was bland, overstuffed and under flavoured. The pico de gallo was the best part of the meal, sadly. The fritters were good but since they took our plate before we were finished eating I can't give them high marks there.  

Service was fine, except for the aggressive plate-clearing. 

Hipsters wouldn't know a good taco if it hit them the face. For those of you who don't want to waste your money on a trendy location with nice design don't bother. You can definitely do better - Tacos el Asador, Seven Lives, Rebozos..."}
{"text":"I have been here twice (both times with one other friend) and had a positive experience on both occasions!

The variety of the menu is impressive, and everything came out fresh and delicious. 

I tried one each of the 4-5 tacos they had on offer, and loved the cheek and cod tacos. Also ordered their BBQ ribs on potato sticks which was phenomenal. 

Underwhelming was their mexican corn, which looks amazing and they are known for, but flavour was pretty bland but not bad. 

Bartender was super cool and suggested a cocktail for us on the first visit, which was refreshing and satisfied the taste buds.

Overall, I think this is one of the better taco places in the city for a sit down dinner and it succeeds as a destination for a date or group event."}
{"text":"I've been 3 times now and unfortunately have been less impressed everytime.
There seems to be a need to oversauce everything until you can't even taste what's underneath it.  Also, the tiny avocado and mango salad is overpriced at $10.   
This is one step up from Taco Bell at 5x the price."}
{"text":"Stoped by La Carnita for a snack before playing Ping Pong next door at Smash.

First time eating at La Carnita, and I am not a fan. Having worked at a taco spot before, I believe I can tell a good fish taco from a bad one. Seven Lives, has the best fish tacos in the city, followed by Grand Electric. The ones at La Carnita are a joke. Tiny piece of battered fish that did not taste fresh in quality or hot from the fryer.

The ceviche tostada was a slight improvement, however a very small portion for $8. 

Overall, over-priced for medicore taco's ambiance, and service. No wonder the place was empty on a Wednesday night.

I will not return to La Carnita in the future.

2/5 * stars"}
{"text":"I love the tacos and especially the street corns! A lite saucy for me but still love the flavour. Hopefully they can open a new location in Markham or richmond hill, so i dont have to go DT to get my taco fix."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! 

The location has a cool vibe and is right beside a Sweet Jesus, which is nice and some of Sweet Jesus' desserts are found on their menu. 

My fiance and I went there and tried a wide assortment of tacos (beef, pork, chicken) and it was all amazing. 

Definitely try the sweet corn, it was just the right amount of spice and very creamy :)"}
{"text":"Hipster Mexican food, but still tasty. 

We had an assortment of tacos - the cod was spicy, but really good and so was the pork - chips and guacamole, grilled corn, and because it was Sunday we tried the rib special. I don't think ribs are an authentic Mexican dish, but they were excellent. 

A couple of lime margaritas and some beer topped it off and we were all happy. Oh! Try the popsicles for dessert!  Cookies and cream, and white chocolate and raspberry were a nice light and sweet ender to the meal."}
{"text":"Visiting Sweet Jesus? Why not start you meal off with some tacos right next door?

In my opinion, La Carnita is the most consistent in terms of food. I can always rely on them for tasty tacos and one of my favourites, the Mexican corn (so good!).

I'm not a huge drinker, so I can't speak for how good their alcoholic beverages taste, but if you have room for dessert, remember to order the churros! 

They have multiple locations, so if make sure you have the right one when you call to make reservations (recommended because they're super busy on weekends especially)."}
{"text":"Cute little hole-in-the-wall restaurant in downtown. Somewhat small menu but very good food. Great margaritas, $9 on Mondays."}
{"text":"TACOS, specifically fish tacos - that is what La Carnita is known for.  I have always wanted to try out their tacos when they were a pop-up shop but never got a chance.  It was exciting to hear that they opened up shop in Little Italy due to the success and following they had from their pop-up shops.

My SO and I stopped in shortly after they opened up for the evening on a Saturday night last weekend; we luckily avoided any sort of line-ups.  I would definitely recommend going early to avoid any line ups.

We ordered the Rice & Corn Frituras to start - OMG - it was delicious!  Complex, spicy and crunchy all in the same bite.  Beware this appetizer has got some kick.

Next we went into taco mode - we each tried one of the each of In Cod We Trust and Crispy Avocado & Frijoles.  Both we really yummy but my preference was the 'In Cod We Trust'.  The balance of the fish taco was AMAZING; the fish to taco shell ratio was perfect.  I could have eaten 5 more but I restrained myself.

Service was great, quick to order food and attentive wait staff.  

I will definitely be back to check out the other offerings on their menu."}
{"text":"Terrible service! It took us about 30 minutes to receive our food (and we just ordered tacos). Plus, the waiter messed up our order and brought us some of the wrong plates. He barely even apologized and then took an additional 15 minutes to bring us the correct plates. He  also forgot to warn us that we couldn't pay separately with our credit cards and gave us one large bill..

This resto has great potential. The location, atmosphere and food are awesome but the service sucks! I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great spot. Delicious food. Environment is great, bar tenders are super fun. Servers are sometimes a little sassy but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Went here with my friends, we ordered fish tacos, mexican meatballs and churros. We liked all of them. Very chill place. Great customer service."}
{"text":"I will not be returning to La Carnita.

I had been here two or three times before this visit, usually alone or with a friend. Having previously enjoyed the food, I brought a few more friends (a party of 5) to La Carnita on a Sunday to take advantage of the Sunday ribs special.

They don't take reservations for groups under 8. I knew it would be a long wait so I arrived a half hour early to put my name on the queue. They gave an estimate of 45 minutes. The estimated time was no problem, but it was a little off-putting to see multiple groups of two and three, who had arrived after us, go in first. But we understood -- managing seating can be a challenge. We didn't hassle the maitre d'(?) about the wait or about people going in front of us at all; having worked in retail and service, it's frustrating to have people get mad at you for things you can't really control.

We waited 45 minutes, an hour, an hour fifteen, and were finally seated after 90 minutes. A couple of my friends were already pretty pissed off by this point, but I placated them. We got a seat, right? Whatever. Food time.

We sat down, and as our server brought over water and explained the daily specials, he mentioned that the ribs had sold out AN HOUR AGO. This was the final straw. It boggles me that they didn't let us know about this earlier. We were waiting inside the entire time, right by the door, right beside the maitre d'. You would think that, after running out of the dish that everyone gets on Sundays, they would let the people waiting know. Nope. Absolutely ridiculous.

No matter how good the food is, this kind of ineptitude is irredeemable. And on that note, the food here isn't even all that. Besides the ribs, everything else is pretty lackluster. There are better tacos and ceviches at Seven Lives in Kensington, and at Tacos el Asador in Koreatown."}
{"text":"Premium prices for small, average tacos. Order came missing two tacos, and because it was served \"family style\" waitress tried to pass it off as someone else having eaten it. With the steep prices and paid parking, can't see myself coming back any time soon!"}
{"text":"Hype? Who cares. My husband and I visit a lot of new restaurants (he sells beer for a living so that's just what we do...) and this my new favourite!

Atmosphere was spacious and appealing. Enough interest on the walls to keep you looking without being distracting. Great music at an appropriate level, and nice lighting throughout. 

Staff were friendly and prompt, our bartender was well informed and took the time to explain everything we were getting in detail.

Drinks were executed perfectly and the have some really nice beers too ;) I'm a tequila lover myself, so I was especially impressed with their selection and knowledge of the brands.

Food was out of this world! The mango avocado salad was a home-run for me. We tried the Arctic char special, the pollo, the Carnita, and the fish tacos and all of them were outstanding. The fish taco stood out for me... it has one of those sauces that you'll be thinking about in the days to follow... Yumm!!

We were served 2 ice-cream popsicles at the end that were fun and light. The sweet one with pork skin was a real surprise and was really tasty! Nice salty / sweet combo.

They even sent us on our way with a limited edition La Carnita Print done by a Montreal Artist. 

If I could give it 6 stars I would. 
Thank you so much :)"}
{"text":"After dribbling through a list of mexican/taco  restaurants throughout Toronto, next in line was La Carnita.     Reading through all the rave reviews online and throughout the various blogs I couldn't wait to check this place out.   First task is getting in which usually requires a significant wait time (an hour or so)  so be patient or get there early.   Also be sure to look for the skull sign since the restaurant doesn't have a written sign but it's not hard to guess.   Fortunately we went on a rainy night so we were seated right away but most times I've passed by I opted elsewhere since the wait is usually pretty long.   I have a admit, the noise level is super high with loud (annoying at times) pumping music, which I can understand since it is a bar-ish restaurant.   The menu is simple with various taco choices and a selection of appetizers and desserts.   We started out with a fine selection of drinks along with the guacomole and meatballs (highly recommended).   Afterwards, we tried a selection of tacos including the cod, shrimp, chicken and chorizo, of which all except the chorizo were deep fried.   While I'm not a huge fan of fried foods there were somewhat tasty and delectable.     Would I come back...I have to say probably not but it's definitely worth checking out even if it requires a wait."}
{"text":"La Carnita is greater than Grand Electric

Love their fish, beef cheek, fried chicken tacos.  Fish and chicken were crunchy.  Beef cheek was tender and cheeky.  They make their own tortilla chips.  Could use more gauc, but that's always true even in Chipotle.  This place is not so hipster, and they take credit card.  Their churros are standard!

Dining room is relatively big, but it is always packed.  The steps to the toilet could be daunting, especially after flights of tequila.

Their service is not extraordinary, but we are not there to eat their service, are we?

The End."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I enjoy the (high priced) tacos. This place is probably better if you're going for tapas and drinks, rather than a dinner because it's quite loud and difficult to have a conversation. Overall, I personally would only order the \"In Cod We Trust\" taco because that one tastes the best, but for that price... I would personally go to other places first before La Carnita. Prices have steadily gone up and the cod taco is good, but not THAT good.."}
{"text":"The fish taco n corn are amazing. The service is non existent and a bit over priced thus the 3 rating. Would like to see better taco Tuesday's deals."}
{"text":"I've never been to a restaurant where every single dish was delicious and made to perfection.
The corn is a must! Infused with Taste, I still daydream about it on the regular, my best friend had 3 in one sitting.. Yes, 3. 
The tacos are perfection, the meat is rich and the spices and salsa are on point. 
And the dessert..,. PLEASE order the churros and Oreo Popsicle. Heaven! 
Definitely going back very soon! 
My only minor issue was the seating and organization .,,its fairly small so if you have a big party don't go there, it's ideal for 3to6 people tops! The servers were also kind of slow, but it was busy. Go early or on a week night!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It has amazing Mexican food. The tacos, churros, corn, and ice cream bars were soo flavourful. A very nice dine in Mexican food, and I highly recommend everyone to try this place. The interiors are very modern and calm. Customer service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Fried cod taco was OK, though was more lukewarm than hot when it had arrived at our table.  Second rounds of the fried cod fared better, and tasted much better when piping hot out of the fryer.  The special of the day, the pork belly/hoisin taco featured quite dry pork, which might've been a bit easier to swallow had there been more hoisin sauce to moisten the bite.  The street corn appetizer was quite pricey at $9 for what was basically corn on the cob, with very small kernels.  Can't say there was anything about this spot that particularly stood out for me."}
{"text":"Four stars for the pollo frito taco, but two stars for the cod taco. The pollo frito taco was different and so good! I wouldn't normally go for a fried chicken taco, but it sounded good! It was full of awesome flavors. The cod fish was way too big for the taco and not very flavorful. The toppings weren't bad, but nothing special. We had the chips and guacamole too, which was good. The music was also bumping at 12:30pm, which was a little unnecessary. I mean the floor was vibrating. I'm eating tacos, not clubbing."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE. I went with two of my friends for dinner at my suggestion as I had heard good things about it. I was horribly disappointed. After we were seated we had to flag someone down after about 10 minutes to order drinks/food, and after placing our drink order had to call the server back to finish our order as she basically ran away. I, like MUCH of the population, strongly dislike the taste of cilantro. While this is a common herb in Mexican cuisine, I have never had any issue when I've asked to have it not included in a dish. Since so many people find the taste of cilantro to be soapy, most restaurants are understanding of this request. When I asked not to have cilantro in my tacos the server rudely told me that they couldn't do that. When I asked if they couldn't because it was all pre-mixed, she told me that it was because \"it was against their policy to not ADD the cilantro\". At which point I ordered a taco without cilantro and when it arrived it had cilantro in it. All of the servers were rude, acted as though the patrons were a bother, and would push past them to get where they were going rather than making room for both people to pass like the rest of the patrons would politely do. All three of us did not enjoy the service, which is too bad because it took away from what is probably good food (but if you don't like cilantro - you can't eat there). 

I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, and would NEVER return."}
{"text":"Worst service I have I ever experienced!!

The waiter got my drink order wrong and didn't know the menu at all when we asked for suggestions. 

We waited 40 minutes to pay for our bill. The waiter forgot about our table. We had to flag down another waiter to tell him we waited 40 min to pay for our bill. The waiter was very rude and told us we should've just went to the front to pay if the server FORGOT about us. I have never experienced service this bad. We came here on a weekday too. There's no excuse for the server to forget their own table especially the restaurant is tiny inside too.

Would recommend the owner to train their servers more. They clearly have no idea what they're doing."}
{"text":"The tacos here were amazing and my server was very bubbly and nice. I came on a Tuesday at 4pm so it was dead and so my only issue with the business was that the hostess seemed to really hate life in general and her job. No hello or smile which are the only two requirements as a hostess and it wasn't busy as there were only four people in the whole downstairs level. She wanted to place me at the bar and i asked to be seated at the window instead. She said \"that's dirty \" which I imagine would be fixed by cleaning it ? Anyways I opted to sit at the table next to it. Again , the food was great and I inhaled it and my server was also super cheerful and offered great reccomendations. The hostess also didn't say goodbye as I left and just stood there wrapped in her scarf frowning."}
{"text":"Finally visited La Carnita after all of the hype. Overall, I was a bit disappointed. The Mexican street corn was fantastic and was the best thing we ordered. The Mexican meat balls were okay but would not order them again. The Carnita taco was too salty for our tastes while the fried chicken taco was good but not amazing."}
{"text":"As a San Diegan I was skeptical of the Mexican food in Toronto, but La Carnita does the job with tasty, upscale (while inauthentic) tacos on the expensive side. 

We ordered: In Cod We Tust, Crispy Cotija, Spanish Chorizo, Carne Asada, Tuna Ceviche and their \"Select Taco of the Day: Rabbit\". (Approx ~$5-6CAD each)

They come street taco-sized so I recommend ordering ~2-3. Use the bottle of hot sauce on the table for an extra kick. The Chips and Guacamole are a must with well seasoned chips and a whole avocado used.

Their $60CAD pitcher of margaritas felt expensive when splitting by 4 people for 1 glass each and are not very strong, and more on the sweet side."}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I've ever experienced. The servers were incredibly rude and spent most of the time ignoring our party. I deeply regret bringing my friends and family here for my birthday. If you want to be treated with basic human decency, don't come here."}
{"text":"Unfourtunatly my experience here was not the best.
Was met by very rude staff and by the time we finally got a table (we called ahead and they said we would get a table in 5-10 minutes.) 2 hours later .. No one came to even greet us for 15 minutes. Thing is it wasnt that busy. The servers were hanging out and just chatting and doing nothing. Not even a smile from any of them.
We got up and left with a very disappointed birthday girl. But i mean i guess if you hire hipster wait staff you should expect all the training to go down the drain and eventually get hipster service."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. The decor was on point (modern industrial feel), the music was sweet (grade school r&b hits, at times), and the tacos were great. I had In Cod We Trust, which had pickled red cabbage and green apple over battered fried cod with lime crema and voltron sauce, and it was amazing. The pollo frito taco was also really good. It had crispy chicken thigh with peanut mole and honey (mmmmm), Rosey's hot sauce, green cabbage and salsa fresca. I'd order both again. 

The tortilla chips were a disappointment, and considering we ordered it with guacamole that's really surprising. Usually it's hard to disappoint me when there's guacamole involved. The chips were not fresh and they took a lot of my enjoyment of the dip away. We didn't finish them. And the tres leches cake for dessert was only okay. It wasn't as moist or flavourful as I've come to expect. Nowhere near the awesomeness of the Playa Cabana tres leches.

Basically, I'd come back for the tacos and skip apps and dessert."}
{"text":"Really chill, buena vibra all the time I was there and just hands down have got probably the best tacos in the city!"}
{"text":"I visited this location on a Sunday afternoon.  The entire place was empty except for 1 table of 2 when we arrived, and we were met with a scowl from the manager upon entering.  A friendly server approached and quickly asked how long we would be there as they had several reservations for 7pm (we arrived between 4:30 and 5pm).  We advised we were staying for a snack and 1 drink, at which point we were seated.

The disappointment with this visit was not so much the food, which was mediocre compared to other Carnita locations, but the fact that a manager of a food/drink establishment would actually treat customers like she did not want them there!  During almost the entire visit, she did nothing but scowl, looked generally miserable and chatted with the bartender as though she was complaining about having business.  

I wonder why people like this choose to work in an industry where their job is to provide friendly service to the public.  We all felt completely unwelcome in a bar that was essentially empty.

I will not be returning to this location, and will think twice about spending money at the others."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night and it was unsurprisingly packed and VERY loud.  We couldn't hear our own conversations with the people beside us.
The starter nachos, guacamole and bean salsa were very good - the chips were a little too spicy for my husband but I really enjoyed them.  My friends got the street corn and loved it.
When the main course (tacos) came out things went sideways.  My tacos came out at least 5-10 minutes before everyone else's and got cold while we waited for the rest of the orders.  They put the wrong plate of food in front of my husband TWICE and made him repeat the order to two different people.  He also witnessed the cook wiping his nose on his hands and eating off of plates through the open kitchen window and couldn't stomach eating his meal after, which was fine because they were so spicy he was sweating anyway.  The art with the bill was a nice touch but wouldn't go back unfortunately."}
{"text":"I was at La Carnita last night and was surprised at how bad the service was!  The food is really tasty so definitely no complaints there but the service is lacking.  We were a group of 7 people and it took a little while for us to figure out what we wanted to order (which I get can be annoying but still). Our server was really impatient (even clicking her pen rudely while she was waiting to take our order!) and all of the servers that dropped off our food (with the exception of 1 guy) were not at all friendly or smiley (getting super impatient when we didn't answer fast enough whose order it was when they brought it the table).  I was a server for years and understand what it's like to provide good service.  The management should seriously consider retraining their serving staff!  If I was rating the food on it's own I would rate it a 5 star. It's really tasty and well presented."}
{"text":"Horrible service, poor experience. Locations on College and John St. are much better."}
{"text":"Visited them again yesterday with friends. They had simplified the menu and removed many items from the list. The food was okay. We all missed the taste that we all used to love. Nachos and salsa was as good as ever. But the tacos got tinier with even lesser filling and don't taste as good anymore as they used to."}
{"text":"A classic Mexican joint that never disappoints. The tacos are always fresh and full of flavour. My personal favourite is the pollo and the fried fish - along with everyone else in Toronto lol. The grilled corn with all the works is a must order. For dessert, I highly suggest the churros with the dulce de leche dipping. The restaurant can get loud and busy at times, but I much rather prefer loud over it being quiet and dead. Overall - an amazing place and MUCH better than El Catrin (see my recent post about that one...)"}
{"text":"Tacos are my favourite food so I always have high expectations going in and La Carnita came through. The atmosphere kind of reminded me of the southside from Riverdale haha it's dark and theres a bar and a neon sign which is pretty cool. The waitress that we had was very nice and brought our food out very quickly. I had the In Cod We Trust, Carne Asada, and Pollo Frito. In Cod We Trust was hands down my favourite out of the three, it was not too much batter and just enough fish. I loved how you can add the lime on for yourself because Carne Asada, the other taco I had was kinda of too overwhelming with lime. The Pollo Frito was good but the chicken kind of reminded me of Mcdonalds chicken nuggets which was weird but still delicious."}
{"text":"Great eIotes! and fantastic horchata! Service could be improved, however it did not deter from the overall experience! Great place to go with friends"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and also the one on College Street. The atmosphere and food are consistent. However, one aspect that this location is lacking is the service. They seem to be slower, less polite and not as well trained."}
{"text":"Came here this past Sunday evening and wanted a table for four. We saw it was busy and understandably we'd have to wait quite some time. What's weird and upsetting was the tone in which the hostess stressed to us the wait time. Even after I told her waiting was no problem, she then began to mention that it can take 40 minutes to which I said it was no problem again. Clearly she didn't understand that we wouldn't mind waiting, bc she then proceeded to tell us we'd have to wait 40 min or more.. Once again, I told her this was no problem and I guess it takes her 3 times to understand something bc she then took down my name and number. Way to make someone feel welcome and that you want them there..

About 20 min later, as we were strolling the neighbourhood she gives me a call and tells me there's a table available but I'd have to be out in an hour (I CAN'T EVEN.) .. After contemplating the offer she so generously presented to us, we declined to which again she stressed we'd have to wait.. Bc clearly I had not already been waiting this whole time and I needed her to remind me that I'd have to wait on a table I was already waiting for. Most people probably would've just said f it at this point, but I was just so determined to get my table.. Lol. 

Putting that complete mess behind me and fast forwarding to my experience. The waitress, like the previous servers I've had here was friendly, helpful and she checked in here and there to see if we were doing okay. A+ service. The menu has slightly been revamped and they no longer have the \"la carnita\" taco, but it's okay bc the \"carne asada\" is utterly delectable. The ribs special for Sunday were absolutely amazing as well. They were succulent and the marinade was delicious. We also got the pitcher of rosé sangria (another Sunday special) and it was alright.. I wouldn't get that again. 

Anyways now that my rant is over, despite the poor service received from the hostess, my prior experiences here have been nothing but great. Looking forward to the next time I make a trip here!"}
{"text":"The good: Great looking place with a not-so \"secret\" bar downstairs. Dishes like the decor are instagram-worthy. 

The bad: Only had Tacos and they are the worst I've ever had. Much like its neighbour sweet Jesus, it's all skin-deep. Food and vibe have as much soul as a Marley T-shirt. 

Service: nothing to condemn or praise.

Repeat: Never"}
{"text":"I got soooo full after eating here ! The special I forgot what it was, I think a steak one, was amazing but otherwise it was okay.  The chips have a nice natural spicy to them which I like!"}
{"text":"Love this place, the food is always great. The last 6 months or so the desserts have become more amazing then before. Whoever is the pastry chef ... Bravo!!! you are doing an amazing job!"}
{"text":"I was fortunate to go here over the past weekend and for the first time there was no line up. I absolute love this place. The tacos are great and the service is great and fast. If there is no line up, one could actually come here for a quick lunch during the weekdays. It takes approximately 3 tacos to fill the average person from my experiences.

My suggestions are to try the ceviche and chorizo tacos.

The only aspect I would change is to lower the volume of the music to allow patrons to talk normally instead of yelling."}
{"text":"FatCat make reservations for 7pm. But waiting for classy lady who running late so FatCat call to change reservation to 8pm.  FatCat hear person say \"no problem sir\" on phone. FatCat very impressed, because when FatCat show up to restaurant with classy lady,  restaurant packed with happy patrons, and reservation still good.

Things FatCat like
 - Excellent service before and during dining experience. Waiter very attentive.  FatCat never have to meow to get waiter attention.
 - FatCat like the food but order too much. FatCat's fault for being greedy, and not taking waiter recommendation when waiter advise it was too much food.

Things FatCat not like
 - No beer on tap so FatCat have to settle for bottled beer - not big deal for FatCat.

FatCat Try to give 3.5 stars but Yelp not like half stars?  Meow.."}
{"text":"Cool setting, decent food, nice pitchers of margaritas. The food ranged from absolutely fantastic to just ok, with the fried chicken taco being the disappointment (bland) and the quesadilla of the day being the big hit. Service was good. Was here with a big group for a work event, and we were well taken care of. Will definitely return with friends!"}
{"text":"Service here was good and quick. Good flavours and spice.  Definitely ask for more lime.  If they have a Prix Fixe that is worth it.  I personally enjoyed the crispy cauliflower taco and crispy cotija tacos and paletas. My husband had pollo frito and Mexican chorizo. Again he said the food was good and had a decent amount of spice. The corn was good. It could have used more cheese."}
{"text":"Came by after work with a party of 5 (including myself) and was told that we can't be seated until there are 4 of us (which is fine). The guys came late so we grabbed drinks at the bar (small selection of beers). I got the flying monkey which was too hoppy and fruity for my liking so the bartender offered to switch it up but I declined because you know... who let's beer go to waste!?

Once our party arrived, we were seated and we ordered:

Tortilla Chips w/ancho chili power & all three sides (guacamole, sikil pak and mezcal chipotle pate) $14 - this is a great dish to start and share. I really enjoyed the different sides as opposed to salsa or sour cream and the flavoured chips gave it a great kick.

Mexican Street Corn (2pcs) $9 - Mexican creama, queso anejo, arbol & ancho chili powder - I could have gone without this. It was good but in the end, it's just corn with sauce

Thursday Special (2pcs) $8 - basically fish cakes fried - really yummy. Definitely recommend it!

In Cod We Trust $4.95 - voltron sauce, lime creama, pickled red cabbage, green apple & cilantro - all the reviews are right - this is definitely a MUST TRY. The fish is very fresh and crispy

Pollo Frito $4.95 - peanut mole sauce, pickled green cabbage & salsa fresca - I didn't really enjoy this because I usually don't like chicken in my taco or peanut flavoured things.

Beef Cheek $5.50 - ancho braised beef, lime avocado, green cabbage, pickled jalapeno & crispy shallots, queso anejo, charred pepper sauce - the beef was braised so well and it was so incredibly soft and juicy

Carnita $4.95 - confit pork, jalapeno sauce, mango salso, queso anejo, chicharron, guacamole, cilantro - this was good but not something I would get again because it's not very well flavoured.

Tostada de Ceviche $6.50 - albacore tuna, gucamole, coconut milk, habanero, tomato, cucumber - I really liked their ceviche and it has a nice kick to it!

We also ordered two beers ($7 a pint) and a pitcher of margarita ($55) our bill came up to around $200 without tips (we ordered many duplicates of the above item).

Our server was great, atmosphere was awesome. I would definitely come back.

{"text":"So I am writing this review after my second experience here as I was trying to give them another shot at making me feel like they had a good thing going. But I was yet again disappointed.
First off the food is delicious, there is no question about that. Their tequila section could've been bigger but hey to each their own.
The service is where I have the problem. Both times I've gone in I stood at the front for quiet some time (each time the place was never busy) I pretty much had to go find someone to ask if I could be seated. I also waited for someone to come ask me if I wanted anything to drink, I wasn't even offered water when I sat myself down. We had a late joiner and he was served water right away which was great but when it came to taking an order he actually had to get out of the booth and walk to the bar. I must remind you that the restaurant was not busy. He found someone and asked if they worked here they replied \"I do but im not working today\", they were nice enough though to take his order so he could get some tacos.
To top everything off when we asked for the bill we asked for 2 separate checks I was told that they \"cannot separate bills\" ........ Im sorry but with all the technology in the world you're telling me that you cannot put food items onto different pieces of paper? So many places do it and do it well. I said thats ok and he handed me the bill. My friends and I sat there trying to split it up ourselves on our phones while the waiter stood there and just watched never even offered to help or split it up. I gave a tip because I don't like the kitchen not getting anything but he really didnt do anything that deserved one. Im sorry but i gave this place 2 chances to up their service and I have not seen a change. I will not be returning. But Their sister store sweet jesus next door has amazing coffee and better service!"}
{"text":"Heard fantastic reviews and friends raved about this place. Waited an hour for a table. Didn't like the crema on on the corn, mexican spiced meatballs were very good, Carnitas tacos were a bit salty. Just didn't walk away super impressed."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect with this place. We were pleasantly surprised. Went on a Sunday and got their Sunday special- Barbacoa Pork Ribs were so tasty, wish we made two orders of it. Their Mexican Meatballs were also to die for- whatever blend of sauces it had on it was mouth watering! Their Beek Cheek taco was the best, but Pollo Frito taco was pretty good too. Overall, great tasting food, good presentation, a definite recommend!"}
{"text":"It's a nice little place nice atmosphere we can be very busy though food looks really good did not try it yet but I will definitely be going there to dry hopefully we got drinks and the drinks are very good normal price for Toronto"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!!! I had the pollo fritto and chorizo tacos along with the nachos with corn salsa. The tacos are around $6 and small but they are very very very good!  Staff is nice. Cost is high which is why they are not a5 star for me."}
{"text":"La Carnita is well beloved in this city but truthfully I don't know why. The tacos menu is small (there are only like 6 or so?) and while food is decent it hardly seems worth the price point. Service is usually decent enough and we've never had much difficulty getting seated. Once your food has arrived it feels pretty common to be just left alone. Also as the name implies, while there are vegetarian options, it's slim pickings."}
{"text":"I've been to their location on King street as well, I'm a fan of this establishment.

Popped in here as we were looking for a quick bite and were happy that the kitchen was open. We were seated right away and conveniently away from door as it was one of the coldest days of Jan. (it was really busy for a cold -30 night).

I ordered the mushroom empenada and a chicken taco and both were extremely flavourful and delicious.

the place was clean, service was friendly, we weren't there long enough to really give it a wholesome thought, but definitely a place i would return again if i was to be in this area."}
{"text":"It was OK. The tacos were really good but the chips were pretty bad. They were way to salty but the atmosphere is nice"}
{"text":"Delicious! Loved the corn appetizer. The tacos are really interesting and eclectic. Not SO expensive (but not so cheap either)."}
{"text":"My first time in Toronto and I was lucky to stumble in here.  Cool vibe, hearty tacos, and good price.  Way better than the Mexican food I've had in Singapore and London.  No complaints. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Stated off with chips and guacamole.  They accommodated my request for everything to be dairy-free which was nice.  The chips were nicely crunchy but the the ancho chili powder that was dusted all over them did nothing to enhance the flavour.  And the guacamole itself was a little too sour for my taste.

My tacos were definitely better.  Got the beef cheek and carnita tacos and they were nicely moist/juicy and pleasantly tasty.  My friend was less thrilled with his choices though.  He got the tostada de ceviche and In cod we trust tacos and he said they were serviceable at best.   

The place was ok overall.  Not sure if I would return though."}
{"text":"Was there on Monday for the pre-grand opening party. I got to try all of the tacos and each one was delicious, a bit spicy but totally worth it. Try the corn and churros. You'll want to come back for more. Also, the environment (sick graffiti on the walls, chandeliers made of light bulbs), music (love the hip hop and the lack of top 40), and beer selection were superb. Definitely a great spot to chill at!"}
{"text":"Loved! Went with a friend on Tuesday night. We had the chips & guacamole for an appetizer; it was flavourful & the chips were crispy, delicious, not greasy... Yum! Next I had the Tuesday special, a calamari taco, I really enjoyed this too, just spicy enough! I also had a chicken taco which was so good with the peanut sauce!! Definitely would get this again. Finally we split the churros which were to die for! I could drink the dip! Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. Wish I could have some right now! 

This all cost me a total of $20 which I thought was totally reasonable for the quality of food! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to come here for drinks last night, as it was a place on my list that I always wanted to try. 

The interior was nice, a bit hipster.  The music was like being in a club. 

As we first got seated, we waited for quite some time to be attended.  Once we ordered, it was not until about 45mins-1hr later that we received our drinks, and we were not given any water, just empty cups. 

 It was such a long wait that we were contemplating on just cancelling and leaving. 

We ordered: Who Shot Ya?, The Palmomita and the Friday night special which was a turkey something. 

I had order the crispy cotija for myself and the churros to split. Food wise it was good, but because of the poor service, I would not come back. 

This place gets 2.5 stars in my books for just the food.  But because there is no .5 star, I'll give it 2 because the service was just awful."}
{"text":"Was more than psyched when this place opened up as I love a good taco spot. Food is pretty good. I like some other nearby places better but this place has a wicked vibe and sweet jesus desserts!
Service was embarrassing. My waitress was so rude, it was stunning. She made passive aggressive comments at us all night, was blatantly rude, and seemed annoyed by us wanting dessert.
When i asked her to split the bill, she said \"our system doesn't do that\" which... fine, that's possible... but when accompanied with an eye roll and a raised voice as if I was behaving like Marie Antoinette was a bit much.
She hovered over and watched me put in the tip percentage. Guess this has been a problem for her before.
Anyway. Good enough food. Great vibe inside. Awful and rude staff who seem inconvenienced by having patrons  (there were food servers and bussers who weren't so happy to be doing their jobs). But this waitress alone was enough to turn me off, and I'm not usually the type."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the tacos and margaritas but was let down by the service. We had a large table reserved for a special occasion, after really hyping up the place I was made to look quite silly after not being able to get service for at least half an hour during an off-peak time. We were forced to order from multiple staff members. Thumbs down for this La Carnita. $700 not well spent."}
{"text":"There was this bartender, her name was Kanika? 
The service was great. She was so amazing, so accommodating and nice. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible,
No accommodating at all. We wanted to switch tables before getting our food, and it was to much of a big deal for them to do so."}
{"text":"Best location yet. Servers and host a lot more friendlier and less stuck up in comparison to the other two locations."}
{"text":"I went to la carnita with such high hopes but I ended up pretty disappointed! First, we left our name with a hostess for a table of 3 and she told us it would be 40 minutes but likely less. After going to another bar and waiting for an hour we decided to go back to see if there was an issue. We go back and they tell us that it will be another 45 minutes. We start to leave and I receive a call on my cell from someone at la carnita telling us our table was ready! We were standing next to the hostess who just told us that it would be another 45 minutes which was confusing but the person on the phone tells us to come upstairs and our table was ready for us. It was very weird and we ended up just seating ourselves while speaking to someone on the phone. 
Later in the meal our waitress forgot to bring part of my friend's dinner and after reminding her it still didn't arrive. Then my friend was charged for the food that never came! 
While we were eating a man came to clean our table and knocked over a full bottle of water onto the table. He was very busy shouting/flirting with one of the servers and casually left our table without cleaning it or showing that he was going to get a towel or help. My friend's phone was soaked and my pants/chair were drenched. We cleaned it up with napkins while another one of my friends ran to grab more. It was super rude. 
The food was good but over priced for what it is, especially compared with some of the other great Mexican places in the neighbourhood. A sangria, two tacos and splitting a corn shouldn't cost me $30!"}
{"text":"The tacos are very unique and the atmosphere was great. The tacos were very delicious, my favourite being the Pollo Frito. The price is average but it is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is wonderful, with unique pieces throughout the restaurant - particularly a fan of the table lighting - very cool.

The tacos are AMAZING. I had the one with fried chicken, another with tuna (kinda like tuna with guac) and the one with braised beef. They were all fantastic. The taco with cod was also incredible, and the piece of fish was very generous! 

Appetizer was the three dip tortilla, perfect for 5 people to share. The three dips were fantastic, I particularly loved the blue cheese one. 

For dessert, we had the churros and the white cake with raspberries. I liked the caramel sauce that the churros came with, though if you don't have a sweet tooth, you should probably do without. The white cake with raspberries was wonderful. The tartness welcomed after a meal packed with garlic, tomatoes and onions.

The wait staff was excellent, competent and friendly, and the atmosphere lively and comfortable. 

Would definitely come back here again!!!!"}
{"text":"Came with a party of 4 on a Saturday afternoon and this place wasn't as busy as it was going to get but our waitress was just slow. The food looked great but didn't justify in taste, the corn was cold and was lacking salt and a hint of butter...we had the cod and steak tacos and they were tasteless.  All you can feel was the heat from the sauces, horrible. The food was just bland and lacked salt big time. I would rather make tacos at home.  The prices are some what ridiculous.  You will be happier in Chipotle.

2 stars for the $5 tall boy special"}
{"text":"I'm always a fan of this place. The atmosphere is this super chill, almost grungy underground feel that makes it a perfect place to just have a few drinks and hang out with friends. You can always expect to wait for at least an hour if you head there on a Friday or weekend, so try and make reservations if you can. I always get the chips, and you must get it with the guac! The corn salsa is not my favourite but I did like the spicy bean and queso, but the guac is what you neeeeed to get. For tacos I'm not the biggest fan of the chicken one (too much peanut sauce imo) but I do love the chorizo and fish one. I was surprised at how good the rose pitcher was too, I was with 2 others and we ended up getting about 2.5 glasses each for the price (but if you go on a Sunday it's only $30 instead of $50). Otherwise, always love this place and a go to for Mexican!"}
{"text":"Great food great atmosphere but wish they would turn the music down just a little bit so it's easier to hear friends"}
{"text":"Tacos were great, service was good considering how busy they are. Can't give them a 5 star cuz of that odd smell, couldn't stop noticing it. 

Greta spot to grab a drink and snack with friends, trendy and urban vibe, understated atmosphere , no hipsters or Liberty village douchery here."}
{"text":"Tried the corn on the cob as a starter and for tacos had In Cod We Trust, Beef Short Rib, and Carnita. All were very tasty but overpriced. The server was nice but I was very disappointed that they were completely unwilling to split the bill (I mean c'mon, its not that complicated!). The atmosphere was nice but if you sit at the middle tables with the benches there is no place to put your coat or bag except under you or on the floor."}
{"text":"I prefer my tacos to come from a hole in a wall but La Carnita is probably my favourite fancy taco place. All their tacos are good (the cod is my fave) and all their apps are tasty. The dulce de leche for the churro is great. The reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because of the service - I always seem to get snotty servers. They're not rude or slow but they're definitely not friendly. I'm going to try the leslieville location and hope for better service."}
{"text":"This is a really fun place to go with decent Mexican style street food. Love it!"}
{"text":"After a disappointing time at Grand Electric I was excited to try La Carnita! I had them once before at a TUM event and they blew my socks off but how would they translate into a bricks and mortar store?? 

This definitely kicks Grand Electric's butt!!!

Came here with a girlfriend - no wait just walked right in and seated promptly. The vibe is great and the service even better.

Ordered a \"who shot ya\" cocktail - yummy and bourbouny (yep!) and great balance of flavours

to start we ordered the Rice and Corn Frituras and the Ceviche. The frituras were great - just a hint of spice from the habanero sauce. Unfortunately one order only comes with two frituras.. and for the price they could serve more. The ceviche is delicious - served in a little mason jar with tortilla chips on the side. Incredibly fresh but I will say I did like Grand Electric's just slightly better

Onto the tacos! We ordered the pollo frito, in cod we trust and the crispy avacdo & frijoles. All were incredible. This is where La Carnita is miles apart from Grand Electric. I thought the tacos were distinct in flavour, were balanced, were different. They were seriously delicious!

Dessert we got the churros - delicious and sitting in cajeta. Perfect way to end the meal

Overall I thought the service was quick and efficient and the food was delicious. It definitely hits all the right spots on your tongue and the vibe is awesome. 

If there is a taco war between GE and La Carnita - La Carnita wins it hands down!!

PS: They give you some wicked artwork with your bill - I got a deranged looking chihuahua and named him Pepe :)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here over the years, and the level of food and service has gone down significantly. Ordered our usual Mexican Street corn, chip dip and tacos. 1. The Mexican street corn used to be hot (temp. Wise) - and now it barely comes out luke warm. There were even parts of the corn that were cold. I've mentioned it to the staff previously and nothing has changed - I even asked the waiter to ask for our order to be extra hot (temp.), but clearly he did not care to note that. 2. The tortilla chips used to have good seasoning to them - this time they lacked salt. Not to mention the chips we received looked like they were the crumbs from the bottom of a chip bag. 3. Tacos: ordered the cod, cotija, and the cauliflower. The cod was good as always - the soft tortilla was a little colder than usually, the Cotija - no complaints about it, and the cauliflower - flavor wise, couldve added more to it. There's was a trend of coldness to the food today.
I understand you are a popular food joint in the area - but I wish your food and service was a good as it was a few years back. I'm not sure if the new menu, new hires, or something uncontrollable has affected things, but please do address these things as you are one of my favorite places (for now)."}
{"text":"Everything was heavily sauced up, which doesn't really allow for you to enjoy the flavour of the ingredients. The cod taco was a generous portion of cod but heavily deep fried. The tacos didn't seem to have much variety of flavours beyond swapping the meats. The meatballs were tasty but once again very heavily sauced. Feta cheese guacamole was a nice touch. Overall there are way better taco places with a wider variety of tastes."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Love the vibes and the old school hip hop on the sound system..
Service was great... very attentive and personable... Food was  crazy good.. my boyfriend had the Ox tail taco which was on special... only 4.75 per taco and I had the cod taco.... amazing!!! my cod was cooked perfectly and their  in-house made hot sauce was a perfect topper!! would highly recommend this place and I can't wait to go back and bring some friends"}
{"text":"This is really a 2.5...
Service okay
Kale salad okay 
Pollo fritto... spicy, cold and lacked any specific flavour. Not sweet, salty, savoury or rich.. 
the tortilla was cold and the chicken wasn't much warmer. 

I liked the interior design and vibes were cool. Seemed like the focus was more on bar drinks. 
Won't be coming back... for I want to really enjoy the food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner the other day 

Pros 
For such a busy place service was fairly quick. 

Cons
Tacos were overpriced for such small portions, I ended up spending $50 + and wasn't satiated. 

Tables were very close together and uncomfortable. (picture your elementary school cafeteria) 

Drinks were sub-par yet started at $10.


Wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Good, but not that tasty.. Had higher expectations. Could have better vegetarian/pescatarian options. Pricey for what you're getting. Service is OK, casual atmosphere. 

I ordered the \"white rum bling\" which was refreshing and not overly sweet. The \"in cod we trust\" had a healthy amount of cod and coleslaw, quite fresh and tasty. I can handle medium spice but the \"crispy cotija\" was just plain stay in your mouth type of hot that didn't let me appreciate any actual taste. 

My friend ordered the ribs and they were fall off the bone. She said they were yummy."}
{"text":"Love this place. Try the Mexican street corn, pollo Frito, beef cheek taco and the tres leches cake. You won't be disappointed. I only downside is that the music can get so loud that you have to shout like you are at a club."}
{"text":"The tacos were good, but I can't help but compare them to my recent trip to Grand Electric. That's the problem opening after another similar (high end taco) restaurant.

Overall I would have to say that Grand Electric is a bit better, but they are different and I would say that La Carnita is definitely worth a try.

We started with their chips with sikil pak dip. It was good and smokey, but I did find that it didn't maintain my interest. Perhaps I should have ordered the guac, but since my friend and I split the avocado salad, I wanted a variety of flavours. The chips however were really yummy. Top notch chips.

I was really impressed with the presentation of the avocado salad, but I felt the ratio was off, there was too much avocado, and not enough tart dressing or mangos to balance it. I would have liked sliced of avocado, or more mango piled on top. Because the avocado is served as a whole half, it's also difficult to dress. I would have loved something to cut the richness.

The tacos were good, but not grand. The corn tortillas were a bit dry I felt, and all 5 of our tacos ripped and fell apart as we were eating them. It's a messy job but someone has to do it. I ordered the fish taco (in cod we trust) and the chorizo one (red and green chorizo). Both were good, and filling, but just didn't blow me away.

The one place where La Carnita really outdoes itself is the spice. Everything had a pretty high level of heat, and I hear you can order extra hot hot sauce if that's you're thing. If you're looking for a spicy affair, this is the place to get it.

La Carnita is quite loud. It's a great place to bring a date if you want to show how cool you are, but not a great place to bring a date if you want to get to know them. Luckily I already know my friend Andrew B so I wasn't too perturbed.

All in all a good experience, but not blow me away. I'd be willing to try again though (mostly to try their desserts)."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend for a drink at the bar. Ambiance was cool, music was not. They were playing very loud hip-hop/rap and it threw the entire vibe off. The drinks were somewhat decent. Would've given a lower rating but we did not get food so that would have been unfair. Not the best place in Toronto."}
{"text":"Last day before a holiday beak staff get together. A fun vibe, great drinks and good food - too bad the service was terrible. Our server couldn't be bothered to remember who ordered what drink, and when we wanted seconds - avoided our table. Food order was muddled up, and we could hardly get anyone's attention. The bill included a large gratuity for our group of 8 but it was the middle of the day - there was only one other table and as we didn't get service, I'm not sure what it was for. I asked to speak to the manager who's response was \"too late you already paid\". I also complained about the dirty menu - still wet from being 'cleaned' with a dirty cloth, and the bathroom door was gross - makes me wonder if they can't think to wipe the door and the menu, what about what we can't see! Disappointed, the food is good but for the price , I am going elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Walked in with a group with no reservations on a busy night, and was able to grab some seats by the front. Service was a bit slow, but once the food came - no complaints. Ordered the nacho platter with the 3 different dipping sauces (all were pretty tasty imo), the entrees were also pretty filling. Ambiance, as everyone tends to agree on is pretty effin loud, as in: my throat hurt after yelling to a foreign degree the entire night and I'm actually not sure if that's something normal to say after eating at a Mexican restaurant. But anyhow, not a bad experience but wouldn't be itching to come back so soon. Customer service could use some adjustments."}
{"text":"Went here for a date night on a weekday. Chill vibes, but AMAZING food. The nachos here are covered in sauce and absolutely delicious. I tried all the tacos and the fish and the chicken ones were my favourite. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with a larger group. I've been to the other locations before, but this was my first time at the Leslieville location. 

The store name is not obvious, it's on a small paper sign at the door. Those who recognize the symbol though, will have hotm problems finding it. Upon opening the door you see a black curtain, you push it aside and are greeted with friendly hostesses. 

The wait staff was very attentive and polite. I felt a little rushed though and thought it was because there were tons of people waiting for a seat, but when we left there was no one at the door. Overall, great service. 

Food is ok, the prices are rather high for what you get. Presentation is great, while taste is ok. I got three tacos: ceviche (my favourite one), chicken thigh (in a yummy peanut sauce) and the chorizo (way too salty). My husband got four. We washed it down with horchata's,  not great, tasted like expensive 1% milk with cinnamon. The total bill was just over 70$ for the two of us, and we were still pretty hungry. Couldn't justify spending 100$ on tacos. 

This is one of the places people pre-eat for. Yea, that's a thing. Pricey, but a good atmosphere. I wouldn't come here regularly, but I'd definitely come for a special night out."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here a few times and have had a great experience each time. Don't be swayed by the wait times to get a table, the wait is worth it. Or if you are lucky, like I have been a few times a spot will open at the bar and you can eat there. 

I've had pretty much everything on the menu. My favorites are the fish and chicken tacos. Their guacamole is delicious! Their cocktails are a little pricey, so I would suggest a beer, they have a great selection. They also serve Old English in a paper bag! 

They're always playing the best hip hop, which for me usually means an instant winner!"}
{"text":"As I'm always on the hunt for tacos, I felt La Carnita was a must after reading several reviews. My usual spot is Grand Electric and yelpers seem to compare the two quite frequently. The space is a good size and they play banger after banger music wise, which creates the illusion that this is a happening spot. I was disappointed in the prices, sizes, and selection of tacos and cocktails. I had the \"Crispy Cotija\", and \"In Cod We Trust\".  The tacos are very small and the price does not match the size or quality of them. They do put a lot of additional toppings on their tacos but I feel like the flavor and tastes gets lost because of it. Both tacos were meant to be crispy but because of the toppings and sauces by the time I ate them the crispiness was just sogginess. Their cocktail list is on the small size as well and the drinks were pretty small too, unless you chose to go with their over priced pitchers. Personally, I was underwhelmed by the experience, as I was hoping for great things, but it's one of those times that you should just stick to what you know, and that's Grand Electric in my opinion.  

Side Note: if you're the first to arrive, you will not be seated until your whole party arrives."}
{"text":"First off....The door is usually blocked by the line up at Sweet Jesus. They are in the same building! Needless to say, I had trouble finding the place.

My large group was seated upstairs when I arrived. The place was steady, but not packed. It was hard to order since my group already had. The food came pretty quickly tho! The tacos are $4.95ea and they are delicious. Piled with toppings, it was hard to finish 2. Wings were a little overcooked, but the sauce was sweet and spicy!

It was my birthday, so I got a dessert with a sparkler and a candle in it. Pretty awesome. They didn't split the bill."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars - Since I tried both La Carnita and Grand Electric a few days apart - I'm well prepared to contrast these competing taquerias.

La Carnita is a good size restaurant and we were able to get a table at prime dinner time on a Sunday. They also take reservations and credit cards. My only complaint is some of the tables were placed so close, they were practically touching - a little awkward. Music was loud - Alternative style (Advantage - La Carnita).

Service was very good and fast but I felt it was a little \"cold\". The server was all business but did his job well (Advantage - Grand Electric).

Appetizers were OUTSTANDING! The sweet corn was perfectly cooked and packed with flavour - love the the mix of spices and sour cream. The Mexican meatballs were also a standout - the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. These dishes were the best part of the meal. (Advantage - La Carnita).

I tried the \"In Cod we trust\" and chicken thigh tacos. The were large in size and the cod / chicken was deep fried - I prefer grilled. The tacos had a nice mix of spices / toppings with good flavour and had a spicy kick (Advantage - Tie between Carnita & Grand Electric - Real winner is Seven Lives in Kensington Market).

La Carnita had a few interesting beers on tap but relatively small selection. The cocktails were very strong but good. (Advantage - Grand Electric).

I will be back to La Carnita and give it an extra 0.5 star over Grand Electric on the basis of the incredible appetizers. As far as the tacos go - both disappoint relative to Seven Lives in Kensington market.

{"text":"The tacos here are hands down delicious and full of flavour! 

My favourite is the Carne Asada taco. It is super juicy which I love. Also the Pollo Frito is really good and the spice is amazing! They also had a daily special taco, I don't remember it's name but it is in my picture with the red pepper, and I found that tasty as well.

Tacos range from 5$ and up! Not too expensive at all. I know they have an amazing lunch deal for 16.99 if you are trying to save money. 

You have to order their guacamole and chip, absolutely my favourite! 

Service was 7/10 because there was a conflict with our reservation and we were put in the most awkwardest seating when others without reservation got better seating. However, the food makes up for the service though.

Drinks are really strong, so I only recommend if you love alcohol."}
{"text":"Great tacos, all were delicious especially the tuna one. Not a big taco lover but would definitely go back. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food is totally awesome.  The noise level is simply ridiculous, it's impossible to carry on a conversation and it doesn't make for an inviting atmosphere.  And I don't understand why they don't do something about the noise, I've heard many people complain about it."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for 6 on a Friday evening. Upon our arrival, we had a hard time flagging down a staff member in order to get seated which was slightly exasperating. 

The music is also obnoxiously loud so you'll definitely need to shout across the table if you're with a group.

I ordered the \"In Cod We Trust\" tacos which were subpar at best and slightly cold. I've also had better white wine sangria. 

My main gripe was the server who seemed irritated and inattentive and their inability to offer separate bills.

The street corn was the saving grace; along with the sweet hostess AJ who was accommodating and pleasant.

Overall, I wouldn't return to this location. There are far better Mexican restaurants in Toronto that offer superior dining experiences."}
{"text":"Ambiance was great.
Always a wait at nights.
Tocos were flavorful but tiny. Recommend: in cod we trust and pulled pork.
The wings were tasty, I quite liked the creamy sauce.
Still prefer the one on college street"}
{"text":"great ambiance. great service. 
portion is not very large. 
Tried Mexican rice milk, Horchata. Tastes like milk but not as rich. Liked the taste of cinnamon in it! $3.75
Avocado Mango salad is rather refreshing. Delicious but a little pricey $9
In Cod We Trust is tasty! Cod is very crispy but not greasy. Liked the sauce on it. My friend had the one w/ beef cheek, she said it was very tasty. Both $4.75, reasonable enough
Churros were good, I prefer the cajeta dip tho!
Will return to try more items."}
{"text":"If I hadn't been led here by one of my friends, I probably wouldn't have found this place. La Carnita is a hidden Mexican spot with a great atmosphere and a small appetizing menu with something for everyone. 

We dropped by for a quick weekday lunch after realizing that El Caballito only opens at 4:30pm. I was pleasantly surprised at the decor of the place and how much I liked the vibe of the restaurant. The mismatch orange chairs and wooden grunge look really worked. We each ordered a couple tacos and guac and chips to share. The food came out fairly quickly which I like considering we're on a limited time budget at lunch. 

The taco I had; Crispy Cotija was delicious. The carrot slaw on top added the right amount of freshness and a little squirt of lime tied all the flavours together. Although small, there was a ton of flavour packed into the taco, especially in the red sauce they used at the bottom. The guac had a lot of lime juice in it and the chips had a spicy ancho chilli powder on them which created a great combination. 

La Carnita has daily specials with a rotating selection of tacos. I definitely wanna return on a Monday to try their mushroom taco, the fritters, and their mexican corn, which I've heard great things about. 

Tacos are priced around $5 - 7 each and the apps are around $10. A great place and definitely worth checking out !"}
{"text":"Love this place! This is one of my absolute favourite restaurants in the city. Delicious food! Highly recommend any of their tacos and also their street corn!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our meal at La Carnita.

We arrived on a weeknight around 6pm and seated immediately.

Our table of 2 was starving so we started with the Mexican corn and Mexican meatballs. This arrived quickly, along with our pints of beer. We also shared 4 tacos: in cod we trust, crispy avocado, beef cheek, and the daily special - calamari. Flavours were all fresh and spicy.

We finished with the churros - a perfect sweet ending to a great meal."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by a local and I can't even begin to tell you how impressed I was with the quality of their food! If you by chance find yourself here on a Friday do yourself a favor and try the rockfish taco! It is to die for, I literally dream of this place. 

The next day I called to see if I can get the same taco to go, and I couldn't because it was only available on Fridays and no to go because it ruins the experience. I respect both responses and it honestly made it appreciate the experience even more. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Way better layout than the College location.  Seats at the bar have padding and backs.  Lots of space, but never got so loud you couldn't hear each other.  They were nice and sat my two friends before I got there (but apparently gave them lots of 'tude about it).  

The good: food is still excellent, the fish tacos are always a highlight, the corn was SO good (you can get three stalks for $12 if you have more than 2 people); we didn't have to wait in line; those popsicles at the end are sooooo good and it made me sad that the Sweet Jesus store front sucks so much.

The meh: why do they sell pitchers of margaritas but not as a discounted price -- $12 for a glass or $60 for 5 glasses, there is no incentive; the meatballs at this location were not as good at the College location and way spicier; bathrooms often had a line up.

I'd go back, definitely a nice addition to the neighbourhood.  I'd even go back just for a drink at the bar."}
{"text":"The tacos here were good. I got the pollo taco and the chorizo taco and both were pretty tasty. My issue was the service was pretty terrible, it was super hot in the location they put us in, and it smelled like puke where we were sitting, even though it was right by the window. 

I'd recommend either take out or one of their other locations if you want to try this place out. 

There's so many great taco places so I likely won't give this one another chance."}
{"text":"I've been to both the John st and College st locations now and both have been excellent! My only real complaint is that I couldn't get anyone on the phone even though I tried multiple times. Normally this wouldn't be a problem but since the second time I ate at La Carnita, I was making a reservation for myself and a friend with several severe allergies, it would have been nice to have been able to confirm that they could serve someone with numerous allergies rather than risk having to leave once we got there. 

Luckily, they were able to accommodate the food restrictions and the waitress was really great about letting us know what the kitchen could do for us! We ordered one of each of the tacos and the food arrived fairly quickly and everything was delicious. Pricey but worth it. The atmosphere was great, the music was great and I will definitely be going back.

My experience at the John st location was quite a while ago but similar: great food and service but they had a live DJ and offered us some specials since they had recently opened.

Easy 4.5/5 for La Carnita."}
{"text":"ok it was yum but not like line up for hours yummy. 
I had the fish tacos, corn fritters (YUM), churros, guac and a few other things. I think I actually prefer the fish tacos from grand electric better. The guac was good but not the best. I don't know if i would eat there again also because it's not a comfortable dining experience. some tables are communal (seriously, who wants to pay good $$ at a restaurant to share tables with people?) and I've heard about the wait times and there is no way i'd wait that long to eat some tacos that are just \"alright\""}
{"text":"Dropped in for a drink. A selection of good Mexican beers and creative cocktails. Food looks OK, but most notable for its decidedly Mexican vibe. Not Tex-Mex, not 
Cali-Mex, Mex-Mex.

Seems perfect for a quick after work drink with a little something to eat. The most popular for this crowd seemed to be the spiced corn on the cob."}
{"text":"This is my favorite La Carnita in the GTA. It is as authentic as needs to be, it is cozy and it fulfills the Mexican experience you would imagine. Probably your best bet for Mexican food in Toronto if you don't mind slightly over priced items on the menu."}
{"text":"A very trendy look. Kitchen is in the basement and the basement turns in a night club later in the evening. Restrooms are also downstairs, not sure how accessible they are for those that can't do stairs.

It was a busy Friday, but we had a reservation with a 2 hour time limit. Seated half an hour late and were also not served for half an hour. The food and drinks came quickly and was consistent with the other location I've been to. 

When we were ready to leave, it took another half an hour to find our server. Surprised they weren't rushing us out since there were so many people standing.

The service needs a lot of work or they just need more. It's a big place!

Don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Meat lovers dream. They have delicious meat tacos here with amazing flavour. Service is fast and friendly. Fun and lively atmosphere perfect for an occasion! Pretty fair deals for drinks and food items"}
{"text":"been here a few times, and i have to say that my faves are the beef cheek and in cod we trust tacos, and ceviche tostada. these three are staples every time i go, and they never disappoint! 

i'm not sure if they still give those la carnita (screenprinted?) cards, but those were totally awesome. i got the the first time i went there sometime early 2013.

i also love going here for late dinners (around 9 or 10pm), cause i usually get off work after the ~regular rush hour period. there's usually little to no waiting time around this time on a weekday, so that's a definite plus for me."}
{"text":"I went here with friends for dinner and had a good meal. It is kind of pricey for the quantity of food (I paid around 25-30), but the tacos were good and didn't make me feel nasty afterwards. I think three-four tacos will fill most people up. A bonus is that it is right beside Sweet Jesus if you want ice cream for desert. I would recommend this place for a meal out with friends."}
{"text":"Came here with high expectations because my boyfriend has only been raving about their Costada de Ceviche. Sooooo delicious. He ordered three and I had the lunch combo. I had their Mexican street corn with two tacos. And it also came with hot churros dipped in a caramel sauce. Such a good deal! Can't wait to come back for more."}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience! Came here on a mucky Wednesday afternoon with my two girlfriends. We got there just after 530 so we were seated right away. However shortly after this place was packed. We were seated at a small table which was kind of annoying and my food ended up falling on my lap but it was still fine to eat. We ordered a great bottle of rose that was not as sweet as a white zinfandel. To start we had the Mexican corn. Holy moly was this delicious. The sauce on top was nice and creamy and perfectly complimented the corn and spices. I had the beef cheek tacos and the pollo frito. The beef cheek was nice and spicy and both of them had an Indian type smell to it. It was very filling for 3 tacos. My friends had the shrimp taco special that they didn't really care for as it wasn't warm. They really did enjoy the carnita tacos though. For dessert we had the churros and tres leches cake. Both of them were insanely delicious. I was so happy. I didn't feel too full after all that yummy food. With tax and tip we all paid 50 dollars each which i think is pretty worth it for a bottle of wine three gourmet tacos yummy app and yummy dessert. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"So my friend really wanted to try a new spot and neither of us had been so we said why not. We were told by others that the wait would be at least an hour (especially since we went on a Saturday night). I was prepared to wait an hour and that is not the basis of my 3 stars. 

The wait:  we arrived and were told the wait would be about an hour (perfect) so we stood to the side and ordered some drinks. The bar was full so we stood to the side and were posted by a ledge where we could put our drinks. We waited an hour patiently and started to get a little ancy so we asked the hostess how much longer and after several attempts trying to get her attention she finally gave us the time of day and told us she would check her list and get back to us. She walked by us several times before she came back and told us it wouldn't be much longer for us. Long story short we waited 2 hours. I think we should have been told that to begin with so we could decide if that was ok. 

Atmosphere: we were brought to our small table and sat on wooden stools. There isn't much space to feel comfortable and barely enough space to pass other tables to get to the bathroom. It was loud but that was expected. I will say the music was amazing. 

Food: the tacos were amazing. We tried the pork, beef and cod. The cod was out of this world. My friend wanted the Alaskan but unfortunately they were out. I will say that it's not a good idea to order more then one taco at a time because they are not good cold. 

Overall: the tacos were really good and the drinks were strong I really enjoyed that part of the experience. I wish the hostess was a little more friendly and the wait area was slightly more comfortable, especially if patrons are expected to wait 2 hours. Oh and the wait staff were very friendly and fast paced. I would return but it would be during the week."}
{"text":"I am very surprised the rating for this location is so low. Perhaps not as authentic as the college location, but everything is good. Quick service. Massive place with lots of seats, and a patio. Fresh food. It is a bit expensive for Mexican food, but you know that before coming in so that should not be a surprise."}
{"text":"I don't like Mexican food!  Well - until now!

I actually really wanted a margarita from El Trompo in Kensington.  Walked there.  Closed Mondays!  Argh!  So we just started randomly walking.  I knew La Carnita was close by, so I figured I'd see how long the wait was.

It was just before 6 pm, and we got seated right away.  The service was friendly, attentive and overall really good.  I told the waitress I don't like cilantro (generally why I avoid Mexican) and she said they don't make modifications to the tacos, but only one had cilantro actually mixed in, versus just a garnish that was easily removed on top.  We had the daily special (mushroom empanadas omg) and then tried every taco except the last one.  I didn't try the Carnita (the one without removable cilantro) or the beef cheek, but the others were delicious.  My long awaited margarita was really good, although served in a strange glass and without a rim (I liked a salty or sugar rim - I'm sure you can ask for this? Girl next to us had one with a rimmed glass).   Then we had the churros and they were definitely a highlight.

It was perfect noise level in there until just after 7 pm, when you began to have to scream to communicate."}
{"text":"Poor service..the server named ANDREA was very rude..the place was even far from full.."}
{"text":"Ended up with acid reflux. Most will say they are really \"cutting edge\" and \"inventive,\" but true foodies know the difference. This is a mish-mosh of once creative \"chefs\" (if you want to give them that high a regard) relying solely on what was once creative, and shoveling it out to the masses, complete with a totally tacky rotating menu depending on what day you're visiting. If you want true Mexican food: don't go here. If you want a creative spin on Mexican food: don't go here. Service was mediocre; atmosphere was loud & obnoxious. If you're drunk and want to fool yourself into spending $55 for an overdressed mango salad, three different taco choices (two of which were fried beyond recognition - the cotija and the chicken tacos) and a side of chips with poorly executed guacamole, salsa and bean dip ($14; insulting for the quality), then this might be the place for you, but even still (again, if you're drunk) this might incite a visit to the Porcelain Goddess (yes: throw up) quicker than it would satisfy your appetite. Furthermore, the menu advertises buying the kitchen a beer for $5, when you know they pay much less than that per unit. I'd be quicker to buy them a cook book or urge them to get a refund on their culinary training. Totally disappointing."}
{"text":"It was my first time at LaCarnita.The taste was ok. Nothing special but the price was too expensive for something so mundane."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give La Carnita more stars. I'll explain the good aspects of the meal and then move on to why I removed two stars.

The chips, guac and tacos were amazing. We had the beef cheek and the calamari. Both were outstanding; great flavours, nice size and a delicious tortilla that didn't rip apart or need to be doubled up. Guac was very nice, although I wish they offered a small bowl of salsa as well for the price. Chips had a dusting of chili powder on them which was fun and unique.

Pitcher or Margaritas for $60 is a solid choice. Not too sweet and the right balance of lime and tequila. If you like your margs, this is far the better deal than individual drinks.
Service was really great. We rarely wanted for anything and they all seemed to be happy and communicating well with one another.

Now the not so great:

HOLY HELL WAS IT LOUD!!!

Hey, I like loud music, but at 5:30 pm? This place has more of a 2 am vibe. I think that the concept works to get people in and out quickly, but I would be way better if they didn't open until 10pm and stayed open until 3 am. I could seriously pack back some of these tacos after a night and drinking and dancing. I actually could not hear my friend at all by the end of the meal. We couldn't speak a word to one another until we got outside.

The tres leches cake was really gross. I don't usually order dessert, but everything up until that point was so good that I wanted to try this specific dessert. It was like a soggy strawberry shortcake in a cup and tasted like it was made a month ago. My friend agreed that it was a pretty disappointing dessert. Waste of calories-- I should have had another drink, instead.

I think I may stick to Playa Cabana for my sit down taco fix."}
{"text":"I was so happy to see this acclaimed restaurant open a second location in Leslieville/Riverside. The space is fun and upbeat, with a lot of seating at hi-top tables. Loud, energetic music and lots of happy chatter make this a lively place. The food is not inexpensive, but wow, is it ever good. A great cocktail list started us off. I loved the drink that was bourbon-based...something about shooting. Cannot recall the super catchy name right now! the margarita was also superb. We had two appetizers and two tacos, plus dessert, and shared everything. We loved the variety of spices, and the amazing kick in some dishes after the fact. It was a \"wait for it.....\" experience :) Loved the rice and corn frituras, and the mango avocado salad was amazing. We had the two daily specials...the chorizo empanada and the shrimp taco. Both were mind-blowingly good. For dessert, we split the strawberry rhubarb \"popsicle\" and the churros...OMG, so good! Overall this was not a cheap meal, but it was an excellent meal."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what everyone likes about this place. The food is absolutely horrible. I am Mexican and while I understand that this is NOT authentic mexican food, the tacos are drenched in peanuts sauce and mayo, so much so that I couldn't even taste the meat in them. The combination of flavors just didn't do it for me. 

I had the tuna tostada, the octopus taco, the cheek taco, and the cod taco. The only one I would maybe eat again is the tostada. The rest were pretty awful. 

Our server was nice. She tried a couple of times to up sell which was annoying, especially considering how we ordered a substantial amount of food to begin with. Also, for some reason the restaurant had a foul smell when we walked in... Maybe not enough ventilation?

Overall, I'd say spare the 45 minute wait and go to 7 lives."}
{"text":"I've been here twice: once just for drinks and tonight for drinks and dinner. On both occasions the service has been indifferent and impersonal at the bar. When I tried the food I was sufficiently uncharmed. The tacos were honestly terrible. I was actually too embarrassed and too hungry to complain, and I realize that i should have brought it to the manager's attention, but none of the staff seemed to really care. These were legitimately the WORST tacos I've ever had. The fish taco didn't smell very fresh the ceviche tostada was overwhelmed with overripe guacamole and the chorizo taco was very close to dog food. Dog food might have been better, depending on the brand. Food was cold, bland and the textures were actually a bit icky.
Margaritas are not a shaken cocktail but a mix poured from one of the taps. 
Also, I've never visited a Mexican Restaurant that didn't have a hot sauce that was HOT! At least with the poor quality of the food, some really kicking' hot sauce could have masked things a bit.
We asked for hot sauce and the bartender gave us his hottest. Tabasco is hotter than this stuff! We asked for some chopped haberneros and he looked perplexed. He said no one had ever asked for that before.  We asked him to check with the kitchen, but they only had sauce that was  equally as bland as the first one. 
This place is all location and zero substance. Music is obnoxiously loud to distract from the staff's lack of people skills and the subpar food. Definitely not worth the $$ for dining out as the tacos are super expensive and it's very easy to make better tacos at home and skip the weird, unbecoming vibe here.
Boo.
I will not eat or drink here again. La Carnita ought to be ashamed of this outpost. I feel bad only giving one star, but I didn't find redemption in any corner of this place. There are so many places to get tacos in Toronto-- GOOD TACOS. This definitely isn't one of them."}
{"text":"I've been to La Carnita a bunch of times and realized I've never reviewed it.  If I had written my review after the first time, I'd probably give 4 stars.  Since then they've gone and expanded to two locations - rightfully so.

Consistency is the name of the game here.  All of their tacos are pretty good, their drinks are good, they play old school hiphop, the service is good.  Nothing particularly stands out though... except when I went on a Sunday and they had a rib special which everyone overlooked and was phenomenal.  

Everywhere in the city serves tacos now and I feel like the trend is to stack them higher and higher with random ingredients until half of it ends up on the plate when you try to eat it.  La Carnita is still in the top 5, though."}
{"text":"If you get a kick out of cultural appropriation and salivate at the thought of blowing your disposable income on a fun night of eating tacos and sharing a 40oz of Old English straight out of the paper bag to some incredibly loud, braggadocious rap courtesy of Rick Ross while surrounded by trust fund hipsters wearing what can only be described as 'goth grunge' attire (navy blue lipstick, chola eyebrows, precariously perched toques, and endless plaid), then you will LOVE La Carnita, which is almost an exact replica of Grand Electric except bigger and with good service, and ps - definitely get the churros."}
{"text":"My best friend was coming to town so I wanted to take her to a good Mexican restaurant. After reviewing multiple places on Yelp, La Carnita seemed like the best choice. I do not regret it at all because this place had fantastic food and drinks.

If you're coming for dinner, make reservations! This place gets busy and you may have to wait if you want to get a seat. I love how the restaurant was more narrow than long, but it does have a good amount of seating. The restaurant itself had a great vibe because of the wall decorations, the open bar, and the loud sound level. 

To start, we ordered the Tortilla Chips and the Mexican Meatballs. I highly recommend the chips because they give huge amounts! 

This was my first time really eating at a Mexican restaurant, so do not be like me and order 5 tacos....I was full after two but greedy me felt that I needed to eat more. The portion of each taco was large so I was able to understand why it was on the pricey side. If you order two tacos and a drink, it should cost less than $20. These tacos were so delicious and tasted extremely fresh. I loved the soft shells and how all the ingredients blended so well together. I ordered the:

1. In Cod We Trust: Best fish taco hands down. 
2. Pollo Frito: This is amazing, you must get this! The chicken was so moist and had incredible flavour. 
3. Crispy Cotija: Deep fried cheese, what more can you ask for? This had a really nice texture to it because the cheese itself was very crispy.
4. Carnita: Shredded pork. This was really good as well. 

We ordered two drinks, sorry I don't remember the names but they were delicious and creative!"}
{"text":"I'll start with the positive. The food is really really good. Creative spin on Mexican. The churros were my favorite. So fresh and sugared perfected.

However, our experience was tarnished by the service. Our tacos came within seconds of us getting our appetizer and all the server said was \"oh bad timing\". Then we got the second set of tacos immediately after, again with just a \"ya the appetizers usually come out earlier\". The nail in the coffin, as I was taking the first bite of my last taco, the server took the plate right from under me. 

Again, food was great, but will never go back. Bad service is unforgivable."}
{"text":"As a Mexican food enthusiast, trying this place was long overdue! I would have given 4 stars because of the amazing food but the service was garbage.

I had the Tortilla Chips with Guacamole to start. Amazing! I really wish it came with more guac though because it was gone in a second. The Pollo Frito and Beef Cheek tacos were also delicious. No complaints there. For dessert I had the Cookies and Cream Paletas which was also phenomenal. I highly recommend getting it if you go.

My issue with this place is the service. I was there with my boyfriend on a Sunday night and just after a snow storm. It was not busy at all. However, our server was MIA most of the night. She never checked on us. I had to ask busboys to call our server when we needed something. Our drinks came AFTER the appetizer and entrees.. and after we asked her to check on them. Note there was only one person sitting at the bar so the bartender wasn't very busy.

While this place has great food, the service really put a damper on our night and my impression of La Carnita. There are several other Mexican restaurants to go to in Toronto that I won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! Went here for a quick lunch."}

Food- 5/5
Drinks- 5/5
Ambiance- 5/5
Noise level- 4/5
Will be back! Half to try those oxtail tacos! Fish tacos were amazing!"}
{"text":"Really like this place. Awesome atmosphere, Great modern Mexican tacos and cocktails. We didn't care for the grilled corn though - lacked flavour and had too much creamy sauce on top. The hot sauce was pretty awesome too."}
{"text":"I was sooo disappointed in this place. The wait was long but we sat at the bar till a table became available. Which took more than 1 hour. They allowed me to sample their beers and found this mocha marshmallow beer to be amazing. That was the only highlight of the night. Music was good but too loud. Ordered the nachos. Brutal. Their chips are completely covered in this ancho chilli salt bath it is absolutely painful to eat. I would dip my chip in the water dry it and then try their lack lustre dips. The dips weren't bad but for 14 bucks I was hoping for much more. The corn is also covered in this rub and over powers the other flavours. The tacos are also meh. They are small for the price and the meats almost taste like they are steamed to suck all the flavour out of it. Just to have the toppings attempt to bring it back to life but fail. Flatline ----------! Will never return here Damn, gotta find a good Mexican food place now."}
{"text":"TRY IT:
-- In Cod We Trust
-- Pollo Frito
-- Tres Leches Cake: THIS WAS AMAZING. 

SKIP IT:
-- Mushroom empanada: sooooooooooo bland. 

MEH / OK:
-- Chips & Guac

I like the chill, dim atmosphere. It's kinda noisy, so it might be hard to hear if you have a large group, but it was fine with me and a friend. Service is kinda meh, but I think that's part of their vibe. Not a fan of the \"too cool to care about service but still expect tips\" culture in some restaurants, but whatever. 

To be honest, it was a little more expensive than I expected because the portions are kind of small, so I'm not dying to come back. But the food is decent."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. Our table enjoyed some tasty tacos and a variety of different cocktails. The atmosphere is also pretty fun and well decorated, but there a several issues that detracted from the overall experience and decrease the likelihood that I'll go back.

Firstly, you're hard to find. You really need a sign. It has Sweet Jesus in huge writing and la carnita in the smallest print possible. It's so small that we passed it - Twice! It was also Winter weather and most tables don't have a hook or a place for coats. We were a table of five and seated at a table for four and had to have a coats piled all over us. Get a fucking coat rack, seriously.
The server also told us at the end that they don't separate bills. You should tell us that first, so that we could promptly leave. I don't go to a restaurant to do the job of a server. I go to be served and then I leave a huge tip because I know how hard servers work. If I wanted to do work, I'd make my tacos at home. I mean, I do have a coat rack, so..."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my favourite restaurants and while it is still fantastic, it has definitely lost its wow factor. The tacos are still unique and delicious as is the great selection of appetizers. Additionally, the atmosphere has remained as lively and vibrant as ever while service is also really attentive and kind. Unfortunately, the chain has increased its prices so that the food is a little steep for what it is. Moreover, they have removed the pulled pork tack off the menu which was one of my favourites. In sum, while I will continue to drop by here every once in a while with friends, La Carnita has definitely fallen off my top ten restaurants list in Toronto."}
{"text":"wow. literally one of the worst restaurants i have ever been to. I had no clue that La Cartina restaurants all had different menu?! which means that the one located DT toronto is nothing like the one here. Food was very very poorly made. Some had too much seasoning, some were too bland. Couldn't believe that the quality of food under the restaurant name La Cartina can be this poor. Absolute horror. When i addressed the problems to the server, he was very indifferent and did not care at all. Would NEVER return."}
{"text":"This place is a must visit if you're going to visit Toronto. The portions are huge and the flavor is spot on. My favorite was hands down the street corn. 

There are always lines out the door (especially since they don't take reservations) so I highly recommend you coming by right when they open to avoid a long wait. I came here with a party of four and waited about 10 minutes when I came shortly after they opened. 

The taco thirst is real, guys. The taco thirst is REAL."}
{"text":"best tacos everrrrrrr. got the chicken one and the vegetarian one , both so amazing !!!!

Even something simple like there chips and guacamole were the best ever. 

This place kills it, love love love"}
{"text":"Very good food with an attention to detail on the presentation. Go on a weeknight to get good service and not have to wait for a seat for 30-45mins.  Also went there for brunch, equally good and the service was better"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here as I have a Mexican food itch since moving from the States. Unfortunately, eating here has made me itch even more! The tacos from the $1 NY street carts is far superior than here. Never mind the overpricing. My friend actually threw up after eating here. *sigh* The search for good Mexican food in Toronto continues..."}
{"text":"I usually go to the college location where the food is always exceptional. This would be my second time at La Carnita at the yonge and eg location my absolute favs were the Carne Asada and Chorizo taco-- so so good!  The mexican corn unfortunately fell short this time it lacked flavor and it was cold so definitely not fresh..other than that it was good! Also make reservations! We showed up on Thursday and they apparently were packed... they had an 8 o'clock reservation so we had about 2 hrs to eat. We left at about 8:15 and they still wanted to kick us out which seemed fishy... clearly their reservation never showed but oh well. Service was still good, will definitely come back."}
{"text":"It was a friend's birthday, so we took off to La Carnita so that we could celebrate with small, sociable bites, a good selection of drinks, and an active atmosphere.

Our group of ~10-15 spent the evening at the 106 John St. location. On the first floor, you'll find their full bar, the kitchen, and plenty of seating. The somewhat dark and sultry vibe/decor continues as you make your way to the second floor, where you'll find further group seating. They seal the deal on the ambiance with their tasteful music selection. Maybe don't bring your aunty here, because she might not get down with \"Nice for What\", but you'll appreciate some good old hip hop & R&B.

I started the food off with some Mexican street corn. This was my first experience with the treat, so take my opinion with a grain of salt... and then maybe shake a couple of those grains on the corn. I'm mostly kidding. The appetizer was overall quite nice. The árbol & ancho chili powder gave a mild spice that was balanced by the crema and queso añejo (aged Mexican cheese). I had just expected a little more zing. The sight of a corn on the cob bathed in creamy sauce and vibrant spices must have gotten my hopes up.

Thankfully, when the tacos came, my posh hopes were satisfied. Two of my highlights were In Cod We Trust, and the Carne Asada. In Cod We Trust had much more of a bright flavour and felt lighter on the stomach, whereas the Carne Asada was built to stop you in your tracks with beautifully tender beef steak, the right amount of sweetness, and a spice match made in heaven. I'd suggest that you have a look at each taco's ingredients, find what pairings you think you'd like, then trust your gut. Not everyone will LOVE all of their tacos, but they've got something for everyone.

Lastly, I've got to give a shout-out to their staff. As I mentioned, we came for a birthday party, and frankly, we were loud and rambunctious from start to finish. That notwithstanding, the waiters were patient with us, handled our... exuberance, and got our various unorganized orders mostly right. Big fan of this location!"}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant,  the pungent toilet smell and horrible front desk/hostess service already turned me off. On top of that, the tacos are just mediocre at best. Especially the fish tacos. 

The big sur was SO spicy they should really consider removing the option to buy the kitchen beer because between all the cheering and bruhaha, something obviously went wrong. The guac was pretty good and thank Jesus for the Sweet Jesus palettas--they were the only redeeming part of our meal.  Make sure to get your ears checked after too because even though I usually like loud, but this place was obnoxiously LOUD."}
{"text":"I'm not really into mexican food and don't really care for it to be more gourmet. I've really only experienced taco bell tacos which im cool with but here's my review anyway. 

Had the mexican street corn to start.  SO good, not sure what they put on it but its fantastic! Out of all the tacos I tried the beef cheek one is for sure the best one.  For dessert the churros were standard but the cake they had OMFGGG i died.  it was like a sponge cake soaked in some sweet sauce (condensed milk?) and topped with a berry sauce. SO moist.  def the BEST part of the meal.  I also tried their paletas.  It's like a popsicle basically.  I tried the cookies and cream one and legit oreos line the exterior of it. so if your down for that u will love this. I gave mine away.  I also tried a bite of the key lime pie one.  Not good either, but I also don't like key lime pie so I'm biased.

This place has a really cool crowd and it would be fun to come with friends or on a date.  lively and lots of cute guys haha.  I just don't see the point paying like 4 bucks for one small taco that I can easily eat 5-6 of.  I am not rushing to come here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Delicious. My favourite cocktail in the city: So fresh and so clean (Jeremy is our favourite bartender and a cool guy!). Street corn is unreal. Yum all around."}
{"text":"Ohhh myyyy gaaaaadddd! Wear elasticated trousers when you come here, they have the best tacos I've had!
The flavours of all the tacos my friends and I had tried were delicious, if you're not a lover of spice as one friend isn't, you can request the tacos 'non-spicy'.  Try the corn- its McDreamy and so delicious! 
 We booked for 6pm on a friday and I'm so glad we did, inside half an hour the place was jammed. Really nice relaxed vibes inside, food is fantastic, every bite is so delicious, no wonder they're as busy as they are!
I'll definitely be back - keep up the good work La Carnita!"}
{"text":"One of my \"go to\" places. I like ordering the chips with the guac, corn salsa and the 3rd dip it comes with although it might be a bit too filling to have tacos afterwards. The braised beef cheek and cod tacos are my favourites. The ambience is nice and relaxed. 

This place gets busy during Jays games, or any other major events in the city. I suggest making a reservation."}
{"text":"Great food, and ambience. Highly recommend the Mexican Street Corn and the Crispy Cotija cheese tacos for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"Tacos and corn are delicious, not my favourites though. Mexican street corn is really good. Cocktails are my favourite thing here. They are really well made, unique and delicious. Service is not bad but it could be friendlier. Ambiance is nice."}
{"text":"I think my search for the best tacos in Toronto has finally come to an end. After trying out a few places, La Carnita has won my heart (stomach). 

I came by with two of my friends on a Wednesday. The music was already bumping when we walked in at about 6pm. They were playing some old school hip hop/rap, the lights were dimmed, and the candles were lit for that added ambiance. 

We were seated and quickly greeted by our server. He took our drink orders very quickly and let us know about everything that they had in pitchers. Shortly thereafter, he came back with our drinks and took our food orders. Since it was our first time around, he was very helpful in suggesting what we should order and the sizes and portions and whatnot. We listened to him the whole time and I'm so glad we did because he definitely suggested some of the yummiest options! Here's a run down of what we ordered:

-Pitcher of margarita: Sweet Jesus, their margaritas are so strong. For $48, a pitcher yielded about 7 drinks, and made for 3 very happy (tipsy) girls. I really feel like we got our money's worth on this one. I would not hesitate for a second about ordering another $48 pitcher of margaritas from this place

-Mexican Street Corn: Sweet, salty, spicy, buttery, and creamy all in one bite?! I'm in heaven. This stuff was amazing.

-Tortilla Chips with ancho chili powder and all 3 salsas: I didn't try the guac, but the two other salsas were very good. 

-Braised chicken taco (Wednesday special): This one was super yummy. The chicken was super tender since it was braised and it had a bit of a kick to it. Sooo good!

-In Cod we trust: I'm not a huge fan of battered fish tacos, but this one was quite yummy. I loved the freshness that the green apple added to the taco.

Our server always made sure to check up on us and he frequently came by to ask us if we were enjoying everything. He paid a lot of attention to all of his tables and he treated us very well. After all is said and done, the three of us dished out about $150 for a ton of food (I walked out with a food baby of triplets) and some strong margaritas. This place was well worth my money and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The noise level in this place is high, very high. 
The seating is rustic, some stools without backs and benches.
The service is very friendly and efficient.

We had their margarita on the rocks, which was fine; a good proportion of alcohol to liquid.
We followed this by the Cava from Penendes which was also fine at about $50 the bottle. The other wines were all from Prince Edward County.

We started with the Mexican Street corn, which was spicy, messy, but well done, and tasty.
We also had the tortilla chips with spicy bean and queso dip. Plenty of chips, home-made, crisp, and dusted in ancho chilli powder. The dip was rich and peanut like. A good choice.
The pollo frito taco was excellent. Very full, plenty of crisp chicken. The fried cod and red cabbage taco was also good, not too greasy and slightly soft.
The meatballs were beautifully spiced and rich, plenty of them.
The carne assada was also excellent.
Overall we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of food. The noise level was a distraction, so much so, that it lost two stars on this count.

Total bill $130 for two"}
{"text":"Tried La Carnita for the 1st time over the weekend at the behest of my girlfriend, who has been raving about the food and insisting that we go for months. 

PROS: Rockstar Mexican food. Good, friendly service. Nice Retro-90's hip hop soundtrack playing in the background for the true heads. Casual dress.

CONS: Slightly dive-y decor. Small venue with tight seating. Forget about a quiet intimate setting. Louder than a Foo Fighters concert. Uber-busy. Make sure to arrive an hour after they open, if you plan to get a table. Packed to capacity. That's because the food is so damn good !!!!

For my own appetizer, I ordered the Mexican Meatballs. Maybe 10-15 minutes later, three golf ball-sized, meat spheres bathed in a rich, spicy sauce materialized at our table.  Being a gentleman, I first offered one to my girlfriend, before digging in. Moments later, I discovered the meatballs to be so damn good, that I actually contemplated being a brute and taking one back. 

For our entree, we tried the Cod and Beef Cheek Tacos. SUBLIME. So much so that we ended up ordering a 2nd round of tacos to chase the 1st.  For dessert, my girlfriend recommended that we order the Paletas (like a Mexican ice cream popsicle caked in crumbs) in the Key Lime flavour. Unreal.

Happy Dance in your mouth. 12 out of 10. Total food-gasm."}
{"text":"In the epic showdown between Grand Electric (GE) and La Carnita, I must say that they aren't really even comparable.  Even though they both are taquerias, and have some similar items, they do completely different takes on them.

VIBE: nice, dark interior- large and deep room that fits a lot of people and is very group friendly.  La Carnita wins over Grand Electric on interior but GE has a new back outdoor patio that is really nice and spacious while La Carnita only has a few tables on the front patio.  Unlike GE- the music wasn't overbearingly loud.

SERVICE: Both were very nice but Grand Electric was definitely better and more attentive.  Took forever to get out bill at La Carnita.  At the same time La Carnita seems like there weren't any line ups and it was rather easy to get a table quickly (due to the larger interior and group-friendly atmosphere- so if you want to take your time La Carnita would be better.  Even though service is attentive, quick (yet gracious) at GE- you will feel the pressure to move out and give the next person in line your space.

FOOD: As I said, the food is not really comparable.  If I were to describe the difference... La Carnita is a Winter Taco, red wine or dark beer and GE is a Summer taco, white wine and light beer.
What the hell does that mean?
Well La Carnita has a LOT going on in the taco..a lot of more stewed flavours, a lot more saucy, creamy saucy and cooked.
Grand Electric has fresher flavours, zested with fresh citrus and less cooked/stewed flavours.
Both are good.. but I ordered some comparable items to compare (even though I don't think it is totally appropriate to compare).

CHIPS and Guac: GE will come with deep fried corn chips, regular creamy guac with chicharron garnish (crispy pig skin).  Nothing too special except for presentation.  La Carnita had same chips but they had a delicious seasoning on them.  The Guac was regular but had similar seasoning and some cheese on top.
La Carnita wins

CEVICHE: GE comes with a heaping pile of fresh tuna.  with avocado- so good.  BUT La carnita, while good, seems like a smaller portion...mixed with tomato and cucumber and comes with chips.  While good, Grand Electric's ceviche 100% wins, no doubt.

COD taco: saucier than GE, more meaty for sure than GE.  BUT- the deep fried piece of fish was not crispy.  The outer batter was a soggy fail.  And it wasn't because we waited too long to eat it..  Grand Electric wins on the COD

LENGUA tostada: GE doesn't really have an equivalent to this- the lengua was so tender. so good.  A MUST order!  La Carnita WIN

Other tacos at the table:
CHICKEN- looked like fried chicken- spicy- definitely a big portion and was tasty
BEAN- the only veggie option on the menu.  Heard it was good.  it was a good meat substitute looking taco and the bean was formed into a sausage form instead of a spread.
Beef- apparently was just good.

COST: GE 3.50/taco vs La Carnita 5/taco.  People say that La Carnita's tacos are bigger, but really, only a select few are actually bigger.  The Lengua and Chicken are probably worth the extra cost but the rest of the items were the same sized PORTION with just a larger tortilla.  So there is a definite price win on GE's side.

For La Carnita you can get a satisfying meal with 3 tacos.  Or definitely full on 4.
With Grand Electric I would say the same thing.

Overall, I would come back to try the other tacos and definitely the Lengua again.
But overall, I would go out of my way to go back to Grand Electric over La Carnita (that is, IF we were to compare : p )"}
{"text":"Love the pollo frito tacos here! Sometimes the wait lines are insane though depending on the day."}
{"text":"Had an amazing night here the other day.  Firstly, I've been trying to GET into this restaurant for months but every time I came the wait would turn me off.  We came on a Monday night around 8:30 and were seated right away.

The food and drinks were great!  We had a specialty drink with cherry gin and cherry juice, it was really refreshing and so tasty.  We ordered the meatballs and Mexican street corn to start.  The meatballs were good but the street corn was AMAZING.  I could have ordered a couple of rounds of that and been satisfied.

We tried each taco, but none of them blew my mind.  The signature carnita was supposed to be the best and the ceniche tostada was also a winner.  

The closing churros were okay - I prefer mine a bit more moist.

Overall, I really enjoyed my dinner and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"When I went to the College location, I loved their tacos. But then I visited this location and I'm not so sure it's the same. I've had their fish tacos and some other ones, but they all left me feeling kind of \"meh\". Their pitchers of drinks are pretty good though, although they are quite pricey. The best thing I've had here is the Mexican corn. It was creamy and spicy all together - SO GOOD! I used to really like their patio out on the street, but recently that's been forced to close I believe. What a shame."}
{"text":"My first visit to La Carnita was great! Service was good (food service took a bit of time). I orders the pollo Frito taco which was really good- I enjoyed the flavours! The beef cheek one wasn't as good. My friend ordered the albacore tuna one and she really liked it too. Judging the reviews we just had to order the Mexican corn. Ambiance was fun and lively and music was great. Definitely a great place to have drinks and nibbles with a few good friends who just want to chill as it's a bit loud if you're looking to linger for long conversations. Definitely want to go back and try their daily specials like the pork belly taco and the butter chicken one!"}
{"text":"Loud and lousy food.  There was a ringing in my ear after coming here.  As well it was so hot that I was sweating through the hard wooden bench.  I understand that there is a vibe that is being recaptured here but come on! Even your servers deserve to not sweat through the food they are serving!  Food was so meh.  The only good thing was the fish taco but compared to other establishment it is meh.  Will not go here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Snooty, pretentious, poorly run.  Place was empty, but would not seat our party of 4 without reservations. Obviously having trouble hiring and/or keeping staff.  I predict will be out of business in a month.  Stay clear."}
{"text":"Had the meatballs, duck taco, ceviche taco, carnita taco, and beef cheek taco. The meatballs were excellent but I'm not good with too spicy and it was a touch spicy for me, but I loved them. Duck and carnita taco were okay with the ceviche and beef cheek being outstanding. The ceviche had a very light underlying sweet flavor which was delicate and delicious. The beef cheek was flavorful and the meat tasted perfect!"}
{"text":"Came here after landing in Toronto after an international flight so I was pretty tired (read: review may be a bit skewed due to jet lag).

Anyways, wasn't so hungry so I ordered the chorizo meatballs. Great decision. They had just the right kick to them. I ordered 4, instead of the regular 3, and I'm glad I did. If you aren't super hungry, 4 of these meatballs makes a great meal. 

Service was....less than extraordinary. Perhaps the waitress was a bit overwhelmed because she had a few large parties, but she didn't give my table of 3 much attention. All in all, it was fine, we weren't in a rush."}
{"text":"Priciest tacos I'll ever eat but delicious nonetheless. Also, the churro game was impressive. I can smell the deliciousness to this day."}
{"text":"I've had La Carnita once before in the The Annex, but this was my first time revisiting it within the past 5 years and it was actually better than I remembered it to be! I'm genuinely surprised at the 2.5 rating!

I came with a few colleagues and ordered from a $16.99 prix fixe lunch menu, which came with an appetizer (I chose the corn), two tacos (I chose a carne asada and a tostada de ceviche for an additional +$1), and a dessert (I chose the iced tea flavoured paleta).

Alright, I admit, the price was a bit expensive since it all came to about $23 total but my oh my, it was SUCH a delicious meal!! Starting off with the Mexican-style corn on a cob, it was nicely dusted with seasoning, charred to a light brown, and drizzled with crema. The crunch was refreshing and sweet, and it really set the mood for the tacos, which were AMAZING. The carne asada (steak) was topped with a HUGE slice of avocado, which was the perfect creamy complement to the juicy and savoury steak. The tuna ceviche tostada was extremely fresh and flavourful and the softer texture of the ceviche paired really well with the crunch of the tostada. As you can tell, I was really impressed. 

However, the only pitfall of this meal was the dessert. The waitress had told me \"paleta\" meant ice cream so I was intrigued by the iced tea flavour - turns out, paleta means popsicle and they're supplied by Sweet Jesus. I've never had one before but I didn't enjoy mine - it was too sour and I regretted getting it. 

Overall, I would certainly come back for the tacos!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this a 3.5 but Yelp only allows for whole numbers. 

It's my second time at La Carnita and both times have been a good experience. Both times there was a line in the evening of about 10 to 20 minutes which I had to wait for. At least they took down my number and texted me in case I needed to go away.

When we sat down the service was fairly fast. The severs were nice and the food came pretty quickly.

The best item in the menu is definitely the corn. That corn itself gets a 5 out of 5. However; everything else on the menu was above average. I ordered the chicken, steak, ceviche, and cod taco. They were good but nothing outstanding so the food was overall a 3.5.

The chips and the three dips were very mediocre, 3 out of 5. I also ordered the margarita which was good as well.

Overall good experience but besides the corn, I'd rather go to other places."}
{"text":"This time had the lunch prix fixe again. Got the corn cob to start (always a fan of this one, it's so good). The two tacos I had for main were the cod and chorizo. The tacos were average considering the tacos you can find elsewhere in the city. Finally the churro - it's thin, crispy and sugarcoated. I personally prefer the larger churros that are more doughy and chewy, so I don't think I will get the churro as dessert at La Carnita next time."}
{"text":"Love the combination of ingredients and the colourful presentation of the tacos. For example, green apple with cod fish - love. The menu is kept short and simple so you can try all the tacos in one shot. I'd say 3 tacos plus sharing an appetizer is a good portion for one person. My least favourite is probably the beef cheeks. I had the Tuesday taco special (wish I could recall the name) and that was my favourite. Too bad the scorpion wings were sold out because the last time I had their wings at the College St location I was extremely satisfied. Churros are a nice ending to the meal :)"}
{"text":"Arrived at 11:45 for lunch with a large party of 10 without a reservation. We were promptly accomodated and seated.  Place became packed within 20 minutes! Orderes the kunch special for 15.99, and was happy to see vegetarian options on the menu. The combo included an appetizer, two tacos and dessert. Ordered the chips with guac, cod taco, crispy cotija ( cheese and cauliflower) taco, and of course churros for dessert. The cauliflower bean and cheese taco was BOMB! Everything else was also very yummy. Highly recommend the lunch menu. The only reason I took off a star was because of the volume of the music. Not sure if we were close to the speakers but it was VERY loud and it was hard to have a conversation with people. Imagine trying to have a convo at a club, it was basically like that."}
{"text":"Went there for a family celebration.  The RAP music was blaring from speakers which were situated above every 2nd table - or so it seems.  Everyone in the place was yelling to be heard over the blasting \"music\".   A horrible experience.   Not to return.  Management, the \"hipness\" of your restaurant is not based on how loud you blast music.  Let the food do the talking."}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying I would definitely revisit! The food was amazing and decently priced. The service was great! The server was able to recommend and in detail explained what to expect with each dish. The interior was casual but also large so it's definitely good for large groups. The only issue I had was that all orders are put on one bill. The table shares the bill and can only be divided into equal parts. Wasn't really a big deal when my friends and I went...it was just inconvenient. I hope they decide to change that in the future. It could make large gatherings quite messy."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. We've been a few times and I always get the in Cod we Trust, because it's always great. The Beef cheek was also pretty awesome too. Get the mexican street corn, you won't regret it. It's fairly small so seating is tight. Great vibe though."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find out LA Carnita opened up near me so I had to check it out. Never have gone to the downtown location but had heard raves about it.

Went with three people at 6pm and waited 15min. 

Mexican street corn : crema is thick and if you like dairy and cheese and corn then HELLLOOOO. I loved it but my friends did not, mind you they are lactose intolerant and one hates cheese (who hates cheese? I need new friends..sigh) 

In cod we trust : it was great, tasted like fish and chips but in a wrap lol. The green apple and pickled cabbage was the topping on the cake! 

Pollo frito : not great at all. The chicken was dry.

Ceviche: I love that it came with a fried wrap. Added crunch to the tuna mush haha. It was very limey which I looved. Spicy as well, by the last bite my mouth was on FIYAH!

Carnita: It was good, nothing special. It tasted as one would expect. 

My friend got a Margherita and said it was strong but what Margherita isn't?? It was small however. 

I got this bomb ass twist on Caesar. I'm so mad I forgot the name!!! I'm like obsessed with Caesars. Anyways it's a lime-ier, spicy Caesar with a can of Corona so u get a nice fizz. Drooling just thinking about it. it's worth it too because they only pour half a can so when u finish half way through u just pour the rest of the can. Two drinks in one?! Nice. *insert cool
 emoticon* 

OVERALL. Would come again for the drinks and corn. Maybe try some other tacos. Must try dessert next although it seems expensive for a popsicle rolled in chocolate etc. Who knows?! 

:)"}
{"text":"I was randomly searching the restaurants nearby in yelp and saw La Carnita. Oh boy, I recalled my bad experience with it after reading others' reviews and I just wanted to put more emphasis on it so that other people will see and decide if they want to go.
I went there with my friends and I was using crutches at that time. It was a very busy evening and we did not make reservation so we expected a long wait. However, the receptionist was not friendly and only came to us after we stood there for quite some time and waved at her. We let her know that we might want to have tables downstairs since it was very difficult for me to climb stairs but the waitress was very indifferent and simply said it was busy so you might not get a table downstairs. Ok we sucked it up and finally got a table upstairs. Food I had to mention it was all good, just like their college one. But again, another long long wait to pay our bill and it took forever. The waitresses were just busy delivering orders. We just wanted to leave. 

So my final comment would be, go to La Carnita on college st, do not go to this location. If you really want to come here, be prepared for poor service."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner the other week, was completely terrific!

Love the relaxed, yet lively atmosphere, the individual tacos are fantastic, and we had the corn as an appetizer and whatever they put on top of it (I'm not really sure) was really really great. Nothing was too pricy either.

Had the churros for dessert, which were also unreal.

Would definitely recommend, and will for sure go back."}
{"text":"Saturday lunch with 3 girlfriends. We waited a long time for a table, and were seated upstairs where it was very cold and drafty. Had to ask a bus boy if we had a server because we were ignored for 20 minutes. The server was cold and short with us, and she and other servers were staring at us and laughing from the bar. Food was good but seemed like it sat on the line for a while before getting to our table, and the server forgot to punch in one of our items but we didn't mention it. Maybe weekend lunch is a bad time to go, but the service was weird and kind of ruined the experience."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:
Most of the tacos are gluten-free and they allow for other allergy accommodations, such as omitting ingredients. I don't believe they do any substitutions. The corn is also gluten-free as is the corn chips with three dips. I'm not sure about cross contamination though, but I didn't have any reactions. 

The food here is good but the music is way too loud and the service is meh. First off, the music is so loud that you can barely hear what your companions are saying across the table. I even had difficulty hearing what the person next to me was saying. 

Second, the staff seem to be in their own world. I had made a reservation, which they had reserved a table upstairs. Normally not a big deal but I was 8 months pregnant and washrooms are on the main level. The ground floor was packed so I didn't bother asking for a table downstairs. As I'm waddling up the stairs the hostess takes off. She doesn't even look back to make sure I'm ok and just walks away towards the table. By the time I get to the top of the stairs I have to look around to see where she went. It's not a large space so she was easy enough to spot across the room. I walk over to the table and she puts the menus down and walks away. The table has benches, not chairs, and it's tucked under the table. So then I have to bend over and pull out a heavy bench and manoeuvre my way into sitting down, which definitely look me at least 3 minutes to do. While doing this two wait staff walk by, see me struggling and do nothing. This place needs some serious accessibility and empathy training. 

TL;DR gluten-free options, terrible service"}
{"text":"I went here on Thursday night.  We ordered the 3 dips & chips, the In Cod We Trust tacos, Ceviche tostada, and the chorizo empanada.  Everything was delicious!  I especially loved the cod tacos as the fish was nice and crispy.  I'm a huge fan of ceviche and there was just enough citrus flavour to it.  The tostada was not too greasy, as they sometimes are, and the chorizo tasted great.  2 out of 3 of the dips were really good - we both enjoyed the guacamole and the corn salsa.  The spicy bean/smoked cheese dip was ok, but wouldn't order again.

We were seated upstairs and it wasn't too noisy.  We were able to have a conversation even with the music playing.  It was really busy and it's definitely a popular place.  After we arrived, there were some people waiting for tables.  The service was good and everyone was friendly.  It's sort of expensive for small tacos but they taste really good so it's worth it."}
{"text":"My bro in law and I popped into La Carnita for a quick bite after the Jays game this past Saturday.  I've passed by this location many times and technically even been inside the building considering it shares the structure with Sweet Jesus hidden back in the corner.

The dining area seems rather tight and cramped.  The bar area to the left when you first enter seems much more spacious and less concentrated than the dining area just to the immediate right of the entrance which is where we sat.  The layout is not very open considering there's stairs leading up and the tables are basically around that with the hallway towards the back leading to Sweet Jesus.  The Sweet Jesus line seems to get longer these days I supposed because it's become so popular and it's hot enough to enjoy ice cream during the day.  

We had ordered 2 items each.  I had went with the special which on Saturday was the pork belly al pastor as well as the ceviche tostada.  My bro in law ordered the beef cheek and carnita tacos and we had a beer each.  

The food was good but it would have been nice to have some cutlery since the food is rather stuffed and some things will fall out perhaps.  We were served all 4 items on one plate and used the tiny side plates to eat from.  This sort of made sense since the table is small but it would have been nice to have both our tacos on our own plates each instead of all 4 on 1.  Still, the food was good and they were a decent serving each.  That and the presentation is pretty attractive.  

Around 5 bucks a taco seems like a lot but it's not entirely bad.  This place just serves what looks more fancy and it's not made to look like a hole in the wall.  I rather like more casual Mexican places though.  This is not Kensington or Tacos El Asador but rather a Entertainment/Theater District restaurant so I don't get that feel.

We weren't planning on staying for a long time but our quick stop was just that... a small snack before heading back home and a space to have a cold beer in a sit down place.

I had wished they'd serve Sweet Jesus' ice cream but you have to get in that horrible line if you want some of that since they don't serve it from the restaurant.  It's a shame because you're so close (you can see it from inside) but if you want the ice cream you have to get in whatever line for Sweet Jesus is going on which these days when I see it, it seems busy enough to block the stairs to La Carnita."}
{"text":"I must say,,, I'm kind of surprised this place only received 3 stars. I had a good experience...

Decor: The place has its own personality. I love the wooden tables and lighting. 

Service: Our waitress was definitely a good one. She had a couple of table to serve and she seemed busy, but my company and I didn't feel neglected at all. She was very knowledgeable of the menu. 

Food: Ohhhh myyy. Happy face :) lol. The sweet corn was sooo good. Definitely a must try. I might have sprinkled some corn juice on my company's face hahahaha. It was just that juicy. The tanginess, creaminess, spiciness all come together like an orchestra in my palates... and they loved the music the flavours created in my mouth hahha. For the tacos, my favourites were the beef cheek and pollo fritos were my favourite."}
{"text":"Don't go if you are not ready to wait 30mints for 3 tacos. Order messed up again! Serious service issues. Donde esta el Manager? Cutting kitchen/server costs will cost the owner! Tacos taste good but im not going back. Adios Muchachos!"}
{"text":"My friends and I loved it here! They have plenty of tacos to choose from in their menu, and all of them are fantastic!

The fish tacos are obviously my favourite because they are just so fresh with the perfect crunch and flavour! Next are the pollo tacos (chicken) because they are so delicious. Thinking about them makes me drool!

Even though this place is crowded and loud, it doesn't matter because you should only come here for tacos! FORGET MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS...YOUR TACOS ARE WAITING TO BE DEMOLISHED! 

IF you want to go somewhere you can socialize, this is definitely not the place. Sure, it has a great ambience and great crowd, but it's way too loud for talking! And by the way, do not order the Sangria because it's overpriced and it comes in a little glass. NOT WORTH IT!

GO HERE FOR TACOS AND TACOS ONLY...AND IT WON'T DISAPPOINT!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great music is annoying at best. Maybe it was because the speaker was facing our table. Need to add buckets or Corona or something. Was surprised that it was only limited to tacos. Would be nice if they offered burritos with similar fillings, but I think they want you in and out to get more in and out."}
{"text":"Tacos are one of my favourite things to eat and La Carnita's experience did not disappoint! 

Tortilla chips
- Good portion size to share
- Chips were nicely seasoned
-  3 dips were all flavourful 

In Cod We Trust
- soft shell taco that had good heat 
- Cod was good that was fried perfectly
- Pickled red cabbage had good crunch, gave the tacos good texture but the acidity of the pickled cabbage overpowered the cod

Carnita
- love the combination of the mango salsa with the pork
- pork was juicy and flavourful but it was on the more salty side
- the sweetness of the mango salsa balanced out the saltiness of the pork

Tostada de Ceviche 
- This taco came in a crispy shell, more of a hors d'oeuvres style
- Crispy shell gave the taco great texture instead of a soft shell
- Great flavours with the right amount of spiciness and amazing guac!

La Carnita gives off a dark hipster vibe. The music is loud in the restaurant so it's not an ideal place to talk to your friends unless you shout a little. Expect great tacos and average service."}
{"text":"I've been to another location of La Carnita, they follow the same kind of atmosphere with the same loud music. I still think the food is great, consistent quality between the two locations I have visited. 

I ordered the carnita, short rib and their daily special which was a bass/fish taco. I love their carnita taco, very flavourful and a good balance of savoury and sweet. The short rib taco also had good flavour but not as good as the carnita. The fish taco was yummy and fresh. The fish was fried nicely, crispy batter and tender interior.

We experienced ok service. The waitress was here and there. The waitress explained there was a large party before us so our tacos came very late (~40mins). She apologized for the long wait and we received churros on the house! 

Service isn't amazing and the dark atmosphere with loud music makes it hard to talk to your friends. It's about $5 a taco, and myself can eat about 3; I would say tacos are more on the expensive meal side. Even so, I'd come back because they have great tacos."}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday dinner and my first impression of the place is that it had a very hipster vibe. Dark, cool lights on the ceilings and it's very loud and crowded. 
The place was really hot I don't know if the AC was broken but some areas wreaked of BO. My friend and I sat by the window and we were allowed to open it (thank god!) 
The food was absolutely delicious! We ordered the tortilla chips with all 3 dips, Mexican Street Corn, In Cod We Trust and the Pollo Frito. 

I would easily give this place a 5 however, our server took forever to take our orders + we waited another 45-50 minutes for our tacos! We were starving so by the time it came we didn't have a chance to actually enjoy our food because we scarfed it down so quickly. 

I'll definitely come back but maybe to another location."}
{"text":"We had the Sunday ribs, carnita and cod tacos.The ribs were very flavourful! The tacos are pretty small, but very good. Since they're bite sized, it gives you opportunity to try a variety but the cost can add up quickly. It is a very casual atmosphere - even the servers are just wearing casual every day clothing and sneakers."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable mexican restaurant. I've been to both the college location and the queen street location and both had very friendly service. Must orders are their baja fish tacos and their corn appetizer! Delish. Their tuna tartar taco is also really good! Very refreshing to have after all the other tacos.

Though, my only small complain is that they use only one tortilla rather than 2 on their tacos, and we find that the tacos easily fall apart since the grip on one tortilla is not supportive enough. Very similar to grand electric tacos as well!"}
{"text":"La Carnita, of Toronto Underground Market (TUM) fame finally has a bricks and mortar location.  Their critically acclaimed In Cod We Trust is obviously the star of the show here along with the propoganda that is La Carnita artwork to go.

I came here with a bunch of my high school friends for Birthday Dinner 1 of 4.  I must say that the company was infinitely better than the food.  As is the (annoying) norm of restaurants that don't take reservations - be prepared to wait.  For our table of 8, the wait was around 45 minutes.  (Don't worry, plenty of bars on College).

I tried the Mexican Sweet Corn made with Mexican crema, Queso Anejo cheese, Arbol & Ancho chili powder.  Word to the wise - yes, the corn is massive.  But no, don't try to break it in half.  The white sauce will go flying, so unless you're donning a bib or apron, do not attempt this!  The corn was definitely sweet, but the extreme blast of salt from a salty Queso was too overpowering!

From the taco front, I ordered the In Cod We Trust.  I also tried the Tostada de Lengua (beef tongue).  While both were palatable, it was hard to remember any flavour as the spiciness of the dishes burned off your taste buds and prevented you from really tasting the ingredients, which is too bad, because it didn't allow the natural flavours of the ingredients to shine.

The churros were divine, and of course best consumed piping hot.  Don't let them sit!  The dulce de leche was viscous and had my girl friend licking the cup!  But I think the most interesting for me were the Paletas - a deconstructed lime pie popsicle with crumbled graham crackers.  Very refreshing, and a great salty-sweet combo.

The service was lacklustre as a few of the items we ordered failed to show up, and we waited at least 20 minutes for a cocktail that was forgotten until we mentioned it.  

For my Mexican food fix, I'll stick with Grand Electric.  Besides, I want to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was horrible.  It's like they really couldn't care if you stayed or not.  We asked four different people for cutlery before I went to the service station and got it myself.  The drinks are ok at best but the food is decent. Wish it was better, I'm dying to find a great Mexican restaurant in the Toronto area"}
{"text":"To be honest, I find La Carnita overrated. It's not a place I'm willing to wait in line for when there are plenty of other better taco places in Toronto. But this location is near my office and is a good location for a summer lunch so I still end up here from time to time.

THE FOOD- The Mexican street corn is probably my favourite thing on the menu but like all the food at LC is overpriced for what you get. The tortilla chips in the chips and dip are fresh and well-seasoned, very yummy! I've tried most of the tacos and they're all good (although nothing really stands out) but once again they're overpriced for what they are.

THE SPACE- This location is much bigger than any of the downtown ones, which makes for a much more pleasant dining experience. 

THE SERVICE- Our server was friendly and helpful, no complaints."}
{"text":"Great hangout spot. Good music and good drinks, decent food. Service, is a bit lacking though. The waiters and waitresses are nice, but my order has been missed or forgotten on several occasions. 4 stars for food and environment, minus 1 star for missed/forgotten orders."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Horrible music volume and song choice for a place like that kinda ruining the experience."}
{"text":"The worst fucking service I have ever received in my entire life. Leaving ... NOW. Our server came once, didn't even get to order.... And he doesn't care.  Ya bye."}
{"text":"1st time went late on a Saturday night during Labor Day weekend and it was about a 30 min wait. 

Atmosphere is loud. 

Food is delicious. 
- my friend had the corn which looked amazing and tastes really good. 
- I had the fish cod tacos: So delicious!

Price is the usual/same as everywhere else for smaller meals. 

2nd time tried to go around 8-9pm (during TIFF) and there was an hr wait so we didn't go. 

I would definitely recommend going."}
{"text":"Have been to this location once before. As always the tacos are amazing and completely out of this world. Had the
* Mexican Street Corn: Delicious but very messy to eat! 
* In Cod We Trust: Love this one. Perfect number of veggies and fried to perfection
* Tostada de Ceviche: Too watery! Wasn't crazy about this as the taco let out too much water, maybe due to the tuna?
My only qualms? The Habanero Hot Sauce - not hot AT ALL. 
We ordered their $30 sangria rosé and it wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Same great tacos, same hipster industrial-influenced set up. Just a different location. Seems like it's a bit more accomodating in terms of capacity of diners. However, I visited on a Sunday at 3pm, when it's really quite dead, so not sure how bad the line ups can get here."}
{"text":"Had dinner here in the patio yesterday, and felt the view was really nice. Food in my opinion was mediocre.

Mixed mushroom empanada- 3/5. The waiter recommended this as an appetizer and I was so disappointed. It basically looked like a samosa with mushrooms in it. 

Carnita taco: 5/5. This was a really good taco, and I would highly recommend it. It was loaded with pork, salsa guacamole and cilantro.

In cod we trust: 3/5. I was most looking forward to this taco, because the fish was huge! I'm not sure what it was, but it was not as good as the carnita taco. 

Beef cheek: 4/5. This taco was loaded with beef, avocado, jalapeño, cabbage and salsa. This was also tastey.

Meatballs: 5/5. Loved this as an appetizer, meatballs were drenched in a sauce that was very similar to BBQ sauce. 

Overall, I feel like there are other Mexican places in the city that are far better than la carnita. The only good thing la carnita has over the other Mexican places (like seven lives and grand electric), is the location."}
{"text":"Such a fun, tasty place! Not the first place I would take my parents on a Friday night, but it's always great for a date or a group of friends, or one friend, or alone. The mango avocado salad is yummy and makes you feel not so awful about yourself. The cod taco is the best in my eyes, followed by the chicken pollo. Paletas are so good, namely the Cookie Monster (I think it's now called the cookies and cream, but they always know what I'm talking about when I say the former). Service is always friendly, I have never had too many questions since the menu seems pretty self explanatory. There always seems to be a handful of people on first dates here, so that's amusing in itself to watch if ever you get bored at talking to yourself or your taco"}
{"text":"La Carnita is a fun and trendy Mexican restaurant.  The restaurant has a gritty, urban aesthetic with the use of stylized skulls and neon lights. The service is friendly and attentive. It is a great spot for pre-theatre drinks or dinner or after work drinks. 

To start, we enjoyed the tortilla chips with dips (Guacamole, Corn Salsa, Spicy Bean and Smoked Queso). The tortilla chips and the dips taste fresh. During the summer, I would order the tortilla chips and a drink and ask to be seated on the patio with my colleagues after work.

While I enjoy most of the dishes at La Carnitas, the signature dishes are the tacos. My favourite tacos are \"In Code We Trust\", \"Pollo Frito\" and \"Carne Asada\". The tacos maintain the street-food vibe of the restaurant - fresh and unpretentious. 

Ensure you leave room for dessert. The churros and tres leches cake are sinfully delicious."}
{"text":"Walked in with a party of 4 at 10pm on a Sunday night and sat down right away. 

We ordered:

Street Corn 
Mango and Avocado Salad
Chips and Guacamole
Tacos: In Cod We Trust, Beed Cheek, Chorizo
Pitcher of margaritas

Everything was delicious and I very much prefer the food and atmosphere over Grand Electric. 

Waitress was a little pushy because the kitchen  was closing and she kept trying to make us order more food. 

Other than that, a solid experience."}
{"text":"Toronto is obsessed with Mexican food and I totally understand why. I had heard good things about this place (thanks in part to my fellow Yelpers!) and we weren't disappointed. 

To start, we had the Mexican street corn, which was perfectly spiced and drizzled with yoghurt. It was so flavourful and we were eagerly anticipating the main event; the famous tacos. I had the pollo frito and the crispy avocado and frijoles, which were amazing! I'm told that the cod taco was delicious, as well. Don't forget to ask for hot sauce if you like it spicy. I wasn't too taken with the desserts, which were paletas. They tasted like your average popsicles. Otherwise, everything was very good. 

Service was good and attentive. There was a real casual vibe to the restaurant, with loud music booming from the speakers. The sound could have been turned down just a tad. We had a good experience here!"}
{"text":"So good, holy cow.
My friend and I went on a Thurday night, and it was packed but we were seated right away. It's a really cool place with a hipster vibe, very loud, very fun. 
The tacos were AMAZING and the margaritas were great. Friendly staff and seating by the windows so you can people watch. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Individual Tacos are a great way to order! Fun place, good atmosphere. HARD TO FIND!!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places. The ones you've probably heard of or about. It sounds cool but you just know it's gonna be so busy on the weekend. Or in general. Especially in the summer. Do you really want to squeeze on to that tiny stool at one of the long communal tables in the back? You would prefer the patio but it's so small... Is this really worth a visit??!

I would say yes. Yes, go to La Carnita. Enjoy delicious tacos for under $6. But remember, that's ONE taco for $4-6. This place is on point in terms of knowing the neighbourhood, it's clientele and decor. Not the mention the food.

My date and I walked over here after catching a Fringe Fest show. We arrived around 8:45-9pm and were told it would be a 25 min wait for us. After putting our names down we decided to walk around. When we got the call, we had just ordered a snack to sustain us... We said we would be there in 10 but we didn't get back for another 20 mins. Our table was still waiting for us when we arrived. Excellent start.

The fantastic service continued throughout the meal. We ordered tortilla chips with corn salsa and guacamole. I liked the chips, the salsa and found the guacamole to be good but missing the heat I like in my guacamole. Both dips are mild, in fact the corn salsa is sweet, so if you can't handle heat these are for you.

Our tacos within no time. We ordered four, the beef cheek, Carnita (pork), in cod we trust and the chicken. I had the beef and the cod. I enjoyed the cod but wish there was less batter to the fish. The tacos come on tiny tortillas, and are overflowing with food. Naturally I felt there was too much for those tiny pieces of tortilla to hold. The beef was delicious. My date had the other two and he was pretty hungry so he basically inhaled his tacos. I'm gonna say he really enjoyed them haha.

The meal came out to under $35 before tip! For a trendy Mexican place that serves speciality tacos that's pretty amazing. And the service was great. So why not 5 stars? The music, while fun, was far too loud. You literally had to yell to be heard by the person sitting across from you. It's densely packed with customers, giving you little to no personal space. And apparently the bathrooms are a fright!

I would suggest giving this place a shot if you enjoy tacos, loud music, and cool decor (esp neon signage indoors, something that particularly appeals to me)! They also have daily specials and are known to serve great tequila!!"}
{"text":"I love this place so hard I wish I could eat and drink here every weekend.

Last time I was there I had the Ms. Jackson cocktail which was superb and I love that they're one of the few places in the city who uses Dillon's Vodka.

Usual faves: corn, guacamole, margaritas, cod taco, ceviche tostada, beef cheek and churros.

The service here is always top notch. The atmosphere is very cool, but not over the top pretentious and obnoxious (like Grand Electric).

They always play the best music, however they really could turn it down because it's just way too loud. 

Overall I love this place I just wish the music was a bit quieter."}
{"text":"If you love dodging seagulls and pigeons definitely come to this patio.

Surrounded by a lovely sea of impatient Sweet Jesus patrons and tourists peeking over the railings of the patio to see what's going on... lies La Carnita. Although the food itself was good, I found that the service was rushed and the waiters struggled to balance their orders while maneuvering through a pile of onlookers. 

After a relatively quick wait, we were seated by a corner table on the patio where birds were constantly flying over due to the dropped ice cream around us. Additionally, the waiters seemed to be a bit confused as once were seated, Guac and Chips were given to us almost immediately. At first - I thought this was great, free chips + guac! However, it was quickly discovered the chips belonged to the table next to us ... a little bit embarrassing since we had already begun eating them.

Once our order was sorted it took a whopping 50 minutes for our order to arrive, this could be because perhaps our order was mixed up with another table or because we were in an awkward corner of the patio. The food itself was great, but honestly - we left as soon as we could... since at this point the pigeons around us were likely plotting to overtake our table.

Would perhaps try again... but definitely not on the patio."}
{"text":"WORSE experience at a Toronto restaurant. 

We drove 3 hours to Toronto to experience this restaurant. We called in advance (twice) to ensure they were open and to see how long the possible wait would be. 

We ordered our appetizer and drinks, and enjoyed those thoroughly. When we ordered the tacos and asked for NO cilantro due to an allergy - we were told \"an allergy to cilantro does not exist.\" I had to explain to our waitress (who clearly had no background in science) that indeed it does exist, and that there have been recent scientific articles showing some people have a genetic predisposition to not being able to eat it. I told her that my guest would literally throw up at the table. She refused to take cilantro out. She told us that \"since they sprinkle it on top of the taco, you can pick it out yourself.\" Why can't you just...NOT sprinkle it on top?!?! It's honestly laughable. 

When we asked to speak to the manager, we got a very young and clearly miserable individual who told us that we could \"choose\" to eat there or not eat there. No apology, no compromise - nothing. She told us that the owners refuse to take cilantro out of the taco's, and that was that. We later asked to speak to her again to suggest that the \"we don't take cilantro out\" rule be written on the website or on Instagram, so that people do not drive 3 hours to eat there - however, she refused to speak to us and ignored us. 

I have never in my life had such a rude and prejudiced experience at a restaurant. I have never had my health come into question, and be told that what I have does not exist. Sure, you guys want to be pretentious - no problem. But to be condescending and rude about it? No thanks. 

Perhaps you should look into hiring individuals who are actually capable of carrying the \"manager\" title and are able to provide customer service without feeling threatened during challenging interactions. Dining is about the food and the experience - you may have good food, but the experience was disgusting."}
{"text":"I think I much prefer this location to the one on college. This is much bigger, and has two floors.. So you don't have to wait a long time. Service was quick and attentive, I find the one on college is a bit slow so I was really happy with the service here.

I had the pork belly tack and the cod taco which both were excellent and quite flavourful! The tortillas was a great appetizer :D. One thing I don't like is that the music is too loud, which is the same at the other location. 

Will visit again!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty much exactly what I had envisioned - a little hipstery, good music and delish taco accompanied by some tasty beverages. 

A few years ago Toronto was so limited with good Mexican/Latin flavors and now I'm embracing this new-ish trend as much as possible. 

The sangria is so refreshing and nice - different than any white or red sangria I've had before. Started with the chips and 3 dips...because we couldn't narrow it down to 1 dip...they were all so flavorful. 

For tacos we had the cod, pollo and Carnita. Cod taco (apparently their best seller) was really nice. The deep fried fish was light in batter but with all the other ingredients came out nicely. The chicken taco was my least fav - still really good but maybe it was because I was borderline in the food coma by the time I got to it but the deep fried chicken was a little too deep fried and tricky to eat. The Carnita was my fav. That taco melts in your mouth! 

Oh, and to top it all off - staff is ridiculously friendly and really helpful with menu suggestions. Would return FOR SURE!"}
{"text":"Taco Love // Vegan Vegg Friendly
Danceable Hip Hop // Happy Hour Specials

Don't skip the fish tacos if you're having a $5 tallboy in the evening!! Packed with flavor great sauces. Tried the Cauliflower tacos as well. I find it interesting to try dishes and combinations that I might not have otherwise tried. There are so many interesting things you can employ in your own kitchen if you are willing to experiment and try something different in restaurants.

Unsure why the rating on Yelp is low.  I grew up in California and greatly enjoy tacos (could eat them every day) After dining in about 3,000 restaurants I can say I really enjoyed their creativity and the drinks that I had here we well balanced too. 

I sat at the bar and the service was pretty good... would have enjoyed having the music a little lower.... but it was worth it for the tacos. Was not sure how good the food at the ballpark would be, glad that I stopped in here before.

{"text":"TRY THE CHURROS. 
No, really. Do it.
But only after you eat the street corn.
And sampled the tacos -
Including the taco of the day (it's never disappointed so far).

Expect a wait (they'll take your number and text you). Expect loud noises. Expect it to be dark. But remember you're there for the food. It's delicious. And you won't leave hungry or disappointed.
Especially if you try the churros."}
{"text":"Thankfully, after years of throwing my faith out the window, the Yonge and Eglinton area has finally rid itself of the Philthy McNasty brand and sprouted up quite a gem - with a catch.

We had a group of 14 and we were comfortable with the amount of space that was reserved for us. Everything was going well, until we realized it takes the focus to of a monk to be able to communicate with each other. The ambience is overpowering. 

The food was excellent. The tortillas come with a choice of 3 dips, the guacamole is reliable. The spiced corn adds both pop and zing to the crunch of the chips.

As for the tacos, they were no disappointment. Try not to expect much in the way of size. These delights come in a handful of predetermined toppings and they hit the mark on the ones I consumed (friend chicken thigh and carnitas aka pork).

The group had mostly positive reviews about the food. Price is fair, not great. 

The highlight of my night was the street corn  (2 cobs for $9). I would recommend trying this and it can be cut into sharing size pieces for better value, I would plan on a full cob and see how it goes from there.

There was confusion if not chaos once we began to interact with our server. She seemed a little overwhelmed with the size of the party and often challenged us as we tried to order items from the menu. She also kept dinging her head on a heavy light fixture, which turned into a fun drinking game as we explored the tequila/mezcal offerings on their menu. 


Food 4.5/5

Service 2.5/5 

Decor/Ambience: dim light and at times the music is your only company - which may not be a bad thing based on personal opinion and other influences. 

I'm very likely to come back for some of the other daily specials and some of their regular menu items.

Go again? Yes
Time line: soon"}
{"text":"Excellent food, nice atmosphere.
Tortilla chips and 3 dips appetizer: corn salsa was my fav
Tacos were awesome.  Great flavours.
Nice beer menu - went well with the menu."}

{"text":"Best menu items are the Mexican roasted corn, pollo tacito, beef cheek tacito and the tres Leche cake. Looking forward to catching the illusive chorizo tacito."}
{"text":"All I can say is it's the bomb dot com! My friend and I were told the wait would be about 45 mins to an hr.  But good thing we waited because after 20 mins,  we ended up getting the window seats which we totally didn't mind.

My friend and I shared the nacho chips with guac. 
I recommend the friday special - oxtail taco! Delish!  Will def.  be back again in the future!"}
{"text":"Very yummy! 

I ordered the beef cheek and pollo frito. They both were amazing, but the pollo frito had a delicious peanut sauce I would definitely go back for! We finished off with the churros, and the housemade cajeta is to die for. 

I would recommend coming during non-peak hours if possible. We came in on a Friday around 3 and it wasn't too busy. I've heard it's pretty hard to get a table otherwise. 

4/5 stars because the price is on the steep side for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"It's hard hardtop get reservations on weekends and try to come here before 7pm otherwise super hard to get seats. The place has awesome tacos and the vibe is great for sharing and hanging out. For non alcoholic drinks get the Jarritos Grapefruit soda or tge Mandarine soda. So tasty. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Over rated wanna be Mexican food. Unless you just got back from Cuba and need something better then Cuba all inclusive resort food. I won't step in there."}
{"text":"Delicious food and the place is sick to go to for a predrink with friends before a night out. I don't like the bench seats there. Very uncomfortable. I'd rather sit at the bar. Tacos are a small portion for the price but if you're going for just an appetizer and drink. This is the place. Don't expect to get a full meal there and if you do get full off the appetizers you're spending a lot. 

Now the reason I'm giving 4 stars is because of the vibe... Lots of young people in their 20's and 30's and the music is sick. From wu tang clan to Kanye west. Very urban when I was there. If they would stay open and turn into a club I would stick around."}
{"text":"Overpriced and overrated.  Great location, nicely renovated space, terribly designed/uncomfortable tables with benches attached (good luck sitting on that bench).  Food, not even that great.  They are not flexible at acommodating (removing an ingredient from a taco, how hard can that be?).   Service, very poor.  Excellent at adding their 18% tip regardless of the poor service.  Their \"communal\" idea of serving everyone's order all together, in the middle of a long table, makes no sense when you are a group.  Hard to find/reach and fight for your taco.     Great Churros.  Tasty Margaritas just not good enough for the $12.50 they charge per drink.     Sorry, but Yonge and Eglinton has so many great restaurants with great service and food, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Once again, food is fine but service is sub-par. 

Came here for my second time with a larger party of 10 for which reservations were made beforehand, and we arrived without having a table setup after the hostess acknowledged the reservation in the system. 

Once again, they sat us upstairs near the fireplace, cramming 10 people into an eating space clearly for 4 people (you know the smaller tables that sit 2 people each? yah we had two of those tables side by side for 10 people). Needless to say, we were sitting elbow to elbow with insufficient space for the small plates to fit. The upstairs area had other bench-like tables that looked obviously more spacious that were not filled, yet for some reason we once again were not seated at those tables. 

Throughout our dining experience, we didn't have enough plates, utensils or cups, and water jugs were consistently empty. 

Maybe third time's the charm?"}
{"text":"I was really blown away by this place. Had dinner with two others. Service was friendly and helpful. We got the Tortilla chips with all three types of dip ($14, but with only one dip $7)-- all amazing. The chips by themselves were also amazing. We ran out of chips but had a bit of the dips left, and when we asked for a few more chips, they kindly gave us a little bowl of more chips. That was great.

We each got one taco and were all very impressed with them. Interesting, unique flavour combinations that worked really well. I got the one vegetarian option and was very satisfied.

The real winner was the street corn however. This was crazy crazy good, best corn I have ever had hands down (and I've had some pretty tasty corn on the cob).

For dessert we got the churros and the cake. The cake was the only thing that I thought was good, but didn't blow me away. The churros were delicious. Not to greasy and heavy, the dough was light and a bit crispy. Well seasoned with sugar and cinnamon, and it came with a very sweet and delectable caramel sauce."}
{"text":"This location definitely did not live up to the experience I had at their other spot. Biggest complaint was that it was soooooo hot in there. For beginning of June, it was hot, stuffy and smelt of puke. 

I had the Polo taco which was good and would recommend. But the cod taco was too salty. 

Any way, the heat in there killed the experience for the group of 5 of us, and I just wanted to eat and go, as opposed to staying for a few drinks."}
{"text":"sour wings, would not recommend those at all
sweet wings taste better than sour
the ice cream bar (cookie monster) was good but a little too sweet.
ambiance is relaxed"}
{"text":"Visited for a quick appetizer taco before eating dinner elsewhere. The patio is really nice, and the tacos are so good. I had the Crispy Cotija taco, and I really enjoyed it. I would love to return and try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Closer to a 3.5 

Not s are why the hate for this place...I had a pretty decent experience here. The decor is very much like a bar, the inside is dark but we sat on the patio that day since it was a nice day out. I wanted to try the corn for sure from all the instagram pictures I've seen. I was kinda shocked at the price for a single taco..starting at $6-$10 for one taco. I don't usually buy tacos so I'm not sure if this is average price or not.. but for $6 I was hoping to get more than one. 

I ordered the corn to share, then one cod taco and the cauliflower (vegetarian) taco to try. Hands down the corn was the best part for me. It is extremely messy so it is not a first date appetizer but if you like corn and spicy then you got to get it! The cod taco was my favourite out of the two, the beets on top added a sweetness and the fish was fried perfectly. The vegetarian taco however fell short for me. There wasn't much flavour a little too much of the bean paste, I guess since I ate this after the fish one it was lacked taste. The fish one had so much more taste than this one. 

When we got the bill the waiter brought over a digital print for each of us to take home which I've never experience and thought it was unique. 

I would probably come back here to try other stuff on their menu but would not go out of my way."}
{"text":"I've stopped in to La Carnita a couple of times since my original post, and must say that my interest in LC is unfortunately decreasing. The fish tacos had this pretty weird sauce on top and the cauliflower tacos didn't even taste like anything...I actually couldn't tell at first if I was eating the cauliflower or the fish tacos. I wish I could say I still love La Carnita but I think I've just explored far too many better options than this place in the city."}
{"text":"When I crave Mexican food, I salivate with the thought of fresh veggies and chopped meat piled on a tortilla wrap. Open faced for all the world to see, nothing to hide but it's actual spices that you only get once you bite in.

La Carnita fulfills my cravings with new and imaginative additions which at first glance sound semi-boring. But when you see it before you, presented on a platter and taste it, you feel that urge to take another bite. As though you haven't truly uncovered it's flavors the first round. You want more!

The first time I looked for this place was a complete and utter failure. I ended up quite mad because \google maps led me astray. I walked past this place everyday and it still remained a mystery. It was not until the crowds and lines that started to appear which made me stop and stare.

I mean, it's small on the outside, has a black facade, a few tables on the patio and a small sign of a skull hanging at door front. Nothing to draw attention but it's customers lingering outside. On a typical weeknight it's busy after 6. Weekends, busier. Even so, it's worth the wait.

I went with a date, first time, so I placed a lot of faith in this place. The restaurant is long with wooden seating, bar included. The menu was short and sweet, divided into 4 sections: apps, tacos, desserts, and drinks on the back. It was simple. We chose the rice and corn patty and octopus tostada apps, in cod we trust taco, and the chorizo taco. Ended with their churros.

The corn and rice patty was my date's favorite. She liked how the different textures and flavors of each component worked well when eaten together. Slightly spicy, crunchy, warm and tender. The tostada, however,  was a bit over salted. Octopus was tender but salty, combined with a salty tostada = extra water please. 

The tacos were good. My favorite was the chorizo because it was full of flavor and meaty. 

Churros weren't great, came in three in a cup of caramel sauce. They were smaller and thinner than the usual ones I've had before, making them drier and harder.

Overall, I like La Carnita. I certainly welcome it to the neighborhood. It adds the necessary budget menu in Little Italy. Good, tasty and different food at an affordable price. We need more of these places, shawarmas get tiring. I like how La Carnita stretches your palette but not your wallet. Good music, good atmosphere, and friendly service."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance and the food is great. Just wish there were more options. Nonetheless, my go to Thursday's!!"}
{"text":"I attended La Carnita's art show several months ago at Evergreen Brickworks, where I had the pleasure of sampling some kick-ass fish tacos. Needless to say, I was excited about visiting their new restaurant in Little Italy. 

My friend and I decided to make a trip there on a Saturday evening and miraculously were ushered right to a table. The place was buzzing with music too loud for conversation. I enjoyed being surrounded by the funky, graffiti-like art, but didn't particularly enjoy the proximity of neighbouring diners. Any semblance of privacy is unavailable here! 

Our server was quite friendly, but somewhat incompetent. My friend asked for a lime with her water several times before some were finally brought over. We were never offered cutlery, which ended up being alright because tacos can be eaten without, but I would've liked a fork for my piled-high Tostada. However, who knows how many times I would've had to ask for one!

We ordered tortilla chips with two kinds of dip, fish tacos, and I tried the Tostada de Lengua. The tortilla chips were crisp and spicy. The guac could've used more flavor, but the Mexican hummus had some kick. Fish tacos were hands-down the best part of the meal for me. The Tostada de Lengua was alright. The meat tasted like tasteless steak, but the sauce was interesting. We didn't finish our tortilla chips and one of the dips and my friend asked that they be packed, but apparently they don't have take-out containers. She ended up getting a paper bag for the chips. For dessert, we shared some churros, which were hot and delicious, dipped in caramel sauce. My foodie friend confirmed that the sauce was not real dulce de leche. I couldn't really tell. 

All in all, this place has some decent Mexican food, but could improve its loud, cramped atmosphere and service delivery. I would come back just for fish tacos and churros, but probably not on a busy Sat night."}
{"text":"I walked into the restaurant planning on making a reservation based on if your tortillas were corn or flour. I asked the host what they were made of and was met with 'uh, I don't know I don't even eat here' and was sent over to the icecream shop to ask them if they knew. 
When actually trying to make the reservation I was told 'I don't even know, maybe like 2 hours ' as a wait time and they were extremely hesitant on even trying to accommodate the table of 3. 
I'm extremely disappointed in the fact that the person who is supposed to be the face of your restaurant for the evening clearly doesn't give a single f about actually having information about the restaurant."}
{"text":"Waited a long time for seats. They told us our table was ready upstairs and continued to make us wait an extra 10 minutes. Two other people came upstairs and they immediately got seated. Girl was very bitchy and said that we had to continue to wait.... Terrible service."}
{"text":"Waitress wasn't on point. Sent 2 drinks back and got 2 more that had a Smokey taste.. and was rude. ...Won't be back."}
{"text":"In Cod we Trust is best fish taco I've ever tasted.... So good especially when jamming to some old school hip hop. The cocktails delicious and the staff friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"6:15 pm Saturday night

Food was okay...maybe more like  $3.50 taco but not our biggest complaint.

Music was WAY too loud and lights were WAY too dim. 

Moments after we decided that it was a most unpleasant dining experience, people to our left sat down and we overheard them complain that they couldn't see the menu (because they were yelling over the music). 

Then, some new guests sat down on our right and said the same thing! Kind of entertaining...but mostly an annoyance.

Music - not sure blaring NWA was the best choice when there were children in the dining room (other guests). I'm not a prude but you decide: 
http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/nwa/gangstagangsta.html

Looking around the restaurant, I could clearly see we were dining amongst Queen Easters (riverside, Leslieville) and the vibe was way too Queen-west-cheesy for our liking. 

We will give it another shot in due time...but they'll lose us as customers if the experience isn't improved and way less 'too cool for school'."}
{"text":"The tacos and dip were amazing, a little pricey ($14 for dip) and the waiter didn't let us know. The music is awesome R&b. The shrimp was so good. The hummus had a spicy pepper that violated my taste buds oh my lord. Only reason for the 4 stars was the price of the food"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant after searching for casual, but fun restaurants to visit in Toronto. I love tacos, so this seemed like a great option. The ambiance was a cool vibe. Loud club music mixed with a hip trendy taco joint was a cool combination. All the decorations and the lighting also attributed to this vibe. 

The prices were a little expensive, especially the margaritas. I ordered a watermelon one, and it was tasty, unique and delicious don't get me wrong, but a little over priced. You are paying for the atmosphere and he concept of a unique taco menu more than anything, but sometimes it is worth it. In this case I would say that is was. The location seemed a bit small and there was not good place to wait especially in the cold temperatures. Overall, it was really fun to try if you are looking for something different."}
{"text":"La Carnita is a great addition to the Queen East dining scene. We went on a Saturday night and it was jumping. The ambiance is young and vibrant (read loud) and the food is delicious. We started with the Tortilla Chips and sprang for the sides (guacamole, corn salsa and serrano and cashew bean dip) which was well worth it. That was followed by an assortment of tacos; we had the pollo frito, beef cheek and carnita tacos but every taco option on the menu looks delicious. Mexican food can so often be cookie-cutter but La Carnita brings together the traditional vibrant flavours of Mexico with a hip and tasty new-world twist. I'm definitely going to make this a local hangout."}
{"text":"Wifey and hubby were craving Mexican while introducing downtown to the then-7-month-old Porkiebun. Luckily the place wasn't busy when the trio came in early Sunday for lunch and were promptly seated.

Hubby and wifey both opted for the lunch prix fixe option that was available at that time. You get a personal sized tortilla chips and a choice of dip. Hubby tried the corn salsa while wifey got the spicy bean and smoked queso. Corn salsa was delicious and tasted so fresh and was enjoyed by both. The bean and queso dip was just too too too spicy even for the wifey who grew up eating spicy food. Wifey and hubby also ordered their popular Mexican street corn and was not disappointed by all the hype. You then get to pick two of their tacos. Between hubby and wifey, they got to try the cod, chicken, steak and tuna. They were all pretty good, well-seasoned and everything in each taco tasted well together, however, portion is on the tiny side. For dessert, wifey got the churros with cajeta (Mexican syrup) and hubby got the Cookie Monster paleta (from sweet Jesus, which was just next door) and could've been better (see reason below). 

Overall, food alone would have earned them a 4 star, however, service was lacking. The server was not personable at all. They also brought out all our food within 5 minutes of each other. Hubs and wifey were still eating appetizer when the tacos came and the dessert came immediately soon after. With the porkiebun in tow, wifey and hubby are pretty fast eaters but still felt too rushed and by the time hubby got to his paleta it was already melting and churro was not warm and fresh anymore."}
{"text":"Takes a while to get your food after ordering. For example the churros took forever to come, but when they finally did, they were delicious especially with the dip. Not the waitress' fault though.

Dark loud atmosphere. Very narrow stairs down to the washrooms. Packed with people.

Tortilla chips with all three dips - fav is corn salsa, followed by spicy bean queso and guac. This was similar to doritos, not tostitos as it had more spice/flavour. Extra $5 for all three dips is too much.

Mexican street corn was yummy, a bit spicy and a bit cheesy, but overpriced.

Tacos: In cod we trust taco = great with the green apple slices, Pollo frito fried chicken taco = liked the mole sauce but serving size is smaller, Beef cheek taco = yummy braised beef and liked the spicyness.

Desserts: Tres leche cake was served in a jar, both sweet and sour, pretty good. Churros are obvy never a bad choice.

Would come back."}
{"text":"I was very excited to come to this place. I must say that all the tacos I ordered (Cotija, Cod and the Tuna Tostada) were amazing. All of them had crunch, a little bit of kick, color, and a sweet factor. They were all tasty, really really tasty! 

The reasons why I did not give the 5-star rating was because of the service, the server was a little slow, plus one of the waiters that brought our tacos practically slammed the plate, maybe he was in a hurry or something.

Overall, great food but the service needs improvement."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for a while now and I think it's one of the better taco places in the city. I like the vibe and the atmosphere, and the service is pretty good (especially at the bar upstairs). Their street corn is unbeaten, and they have some pretty creative tacos on the menu. 

Unfortunately, I can't give three stars because this restaurant is not the same place it was when I first started going. They are following the typical Toronto restaurant story: pay for a feature on blogto or narcity and then jack up prices after becoming more popular."}
{"text":"Location is a lot more spacious then their downtown one, making it comfortable to sit and chat.

We each had a few tacos and side dishes to share. On par taste and prices wise with their other locations. Daily special was a chicken one and it was quite good.

Service wasnt the best here. Without asking, the waitress tossed out my $10 corn that was just half eaten. But offered to replace it which was nice except I had to wait another 30 mins for it, by that time, the girls had already finished eating and I couldnt get it to go since they dont offer the option."}
{"text":"Not a great experience....me and 2 friends went on a Saturday afternoon at 2pm and we were shown to a table meant for 2 people. The 3 of us were extremely squished and right by the door in February, so every time the door opened, we got a freezing cold breeze. It was just very uncomfortable. 

The food was alright. But very overpriced. One empanada for 9+tax! They were not very big at all either."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars.  A few of us in the group were craving Mexican food and none of us walked to walk too far so we settled on La Carnita. I'm definitely not a taco connoisseur but it hit the spot for me. 

Ordered the lunch prix fixe for $17+ tax which consists of chips with dip, a choice of 2 tacos, and a dessert.

Was on the first floor (there are apparently two) and our server was quite friendly. Did our business and was in and out within 45 minutes. The reason I give it 3.5 stars and not a higher rating was because it wasn't memorable for me. Would go again but maybe when we get lazy again."}
{"text":"Tacos are great but they are way too expensive. Defenitly not worth it. A beer is like $8 and it's not even a pint, maybe a bottle size. There are definitely better places to eat/drink Mexican. Please check your menu prices"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The cod tacos are out of his world, and they have great veggie options. I can't believe this place doesn't have huger ratings. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great service for a large party. Seated on the full communal table. 

However, they can only do split payment but not separate bills. With a $900 bill over 20 people, it's hard to figure out who owes what. 

The Cod Taco is still my only favourite on their menu. Nothing else really stood out to me. 

Their drinks are really good though - tastes fresh. 
My favourite is the GoldLink. I asked for another jalapeño drink and they were able to make me a Jalapeño Mojito. 

I always come back for the drinks."}
{"text":"Every time I walk past this place, there's a line up outside the entrance. I can here around 6:30pm on a Tuesday and luckily we were seated immediately. The place is quite dark inside, much like other taco restaurants in the area. 

My friends and I split chips with guac to start. I definitely prefer their chips and guac combo more than El Caballito, which is located nearby. The tacos here are quite small, so three would be a good number if you're feeling hungry. There's a special taco for each day of the week so be sure to check out those options! The tacos were well made and they were quite generous with the fillings as well. For dessert, you can order items straight from their sister restaurant Sweet Jesus. I got a paleta and it was the perfect ending to the meal. They aren't too sweet and don't feel heavy as ice cream can be at times. 

Given the choice between El Caballito, I would undoubtedly choose to eat the tacos here than there! Try coming here earlier in the evening so you don't have to wait long for a table."}
{"text":"The service here on a Saturday night is awful. We weren't the only table really unhappy. There were three of us and I didn't receive my main. We questioned the staff three times and my other two friends had already finished eating. Our last attempt we went to the kitchen and asked what's going on and turns out they forgot about it. They offered to give me dessert and wrapped my tacos to go. The food was fine but since they aluminum wrapped my tacos, they were soggy (I ate them at the restaurant). I would give it another shot on a weekday night but never again on a Friday or Saturday."}
{"text":"An automatic disappointment when the first thing you have to say to me is no separate bills. Being a waitress myself, I understand the whole annoying-ness that comes with a separate bill but seriously???? You would rather pay the waitress to stand at the table while everyone figures out what they had and how much they owe (on a $522 bill may I add!!!). Food okay...nothing healthy and definitely nothing to write home about. Over-priced. Mediocre. Will not return. In fact, shame on you!!!!!!

Want to say so much more but I'll just save my breath like I wish I would have saved my time and money!"}
{"text":"Love the corn  here with all the fixings and of course the taco!. My fav is the fish taco and ceviche tostada! The only thing that disappointed was their churro which was had too much dough for my preference but maybe I'm just used to the ones that are hollow on the inside!"}
{"text":"This is prob our new fav Mexican joint in the city! Foods fantastic - great tacos and starters. Tried one of each taco on menu and you can't go wrong. A little spicy FYI (but we are spice lightweights) but delicious and unique spices, sauces and a clear new take on Mexican standards. Drunk pear sangria - delicious. Ambiance was enjoyable - in check with Mexican theme and music not too loud you could hear your date. Only strike is the hostess who was atrociously rude... But I'm happy we didn't let that stop us from staying. Our bartender was fantastic and personable."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. I came here for my birthday with a friend. We ordered Mexican corn, three tacos each, churros for dessert and a pitcher of sangria. Our bill came out to about $80 before tip. 

The food was decent but a bit overpriced. I don't recommend the sangria here at all. I'm usually lightweight and get a buzz after a glass of sangria but I drank more than half the pitcher and was in between buzzed and tipsy. 

The restaurant was pretty dark so it had a nice cozy feel to it. The music is loud so it is hard to have conversations. 

Overall, if I go to La Carnita again, I'd only order tacos. The alcohol wasn't worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"The food was decent but should be cheaper. The vibe was great. The server was really short with us and barely paid attention unless we waved her down, however, and the two of us were seated all alone on the top floor when there was still room on the bottom- a little weird and ruined the vibe as we walked in. Overall the food was good and came out really fast. I would try it again."}
{"text":"In the wise words of Chris Brown, \"this h** ain't loyal.\" When it comes to Meheecan food, I pledge no allegiances and am always on the hunt for the next best fish/chicken/pork/beef cheek taco. Having visited El Catrin a few days prior, the two experiences were quite polarizing. 

La Carnita caters to a much younger crowd.  It was quite dark inside. And loud. I wasn't feeling my Mexican hipster OG self that day, so requested for one of the two available tables outside on the patio (sidewalk). 

The food: 
Mexican Street Corn ($8 for 2 pcs)- Not really impressed with this, I found the cream a little too nostalgic of cheez whiz. Also, if you are hoping to share this corn with others, ask for a knife and be patient with trying to cut it up. We attempted to break it with our hands and it did not turn out so well. 
TLDR: Eat entire cob yourself. Avoid corn cream all over face.

In cod we trust ($4.75): Loved this and a must-get if you're here. Fish is perfectly fried and not too greasy. One of my new favourite fish tacos in the city.

Friday special- oxtail taco ($4.75): Bonus points for originality and including oxtail in a taco. Oxtail was crispy and complemented the other toppings nicely. 

The service:
Along with the overly rowdy atmosphere, service makes for another negative star. Our waiter was Straight Outta Grumpton and did not crack a smile the whole dinner. Perhaps he had to fit in with the theme of the restaurant. I guess you can't be sunshine and rainbows when you're in a dark room with skeletons and graffiti'ed walls.

To summarize: My sentiments about this place is actually pretty much how we all feel about Chris Brown-loud and obnoxious but just talented enough that we keep him in business."}
{"text":"We came in on a Sunday night with no reservations. It wasn't very busy, so our hostess guided us to a cozy booth near the back of the restaurant. It's pretty big, so if you ever have a large group, this is probably the place for you. We got the chips and bean sauce, and I thought the portions between chips and sauce were fairly generous. 

I got the chorizo and carne asada tacos and my date got the fried chicken and fish tacos. Overall, everything was pretty tasty! Everything was seasoned very well. I recommend the fish and the chorizo tacos. Those were my two favourite. As an FYI, it's one taco per serving. I didn't leave feeling stuffed, but I was nicely full by the end of it. 

Realistically, it is a bit pricy for the amount that you get with one taco ranging between $5-10. But overall, pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"went on date night, portions are small, but food is soooo good! very trendy hipster vibe-"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Loved everything from beginning to end. The peach cocktail was refreshing and the corn and steak tacos were spot on.  The only downfall was that the tables did not have hot sauce. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I like the size of this place, it's pretty big, so probably the line ups are not as long. I came on a Sunday night and there was plenty of seats inside.

The service, it was OK... when the waitress asks us something... before we even finish talking... she is already walking away. When we were ordering, kept trying to up-sell us to order more. We order 2-3 tacos each person and 2 appetizers already.

atmosphere, the place is way too dark, having hard time reading the menu! not really a fan for the decor. The music is WAY too loud, the people at the very back was way tooo noisy also! probably cause the music is so loud, they had to scream to each other) The outside is so dark and no sign, I wouldn't know if it was the place if I didn't see 501A on the door right beside it.

parking, we were lucky to get a spot right in front of the restaurant, but if not, I wouldn't know where to park. 

appetizers, we had the corn and mango avocado salad, which was BOTH delicious! but a bit over priced, 2 pcs of corn for 8 bucks, yes it tastes pretty good, but I can put some dressing and chilli powder on my corn at home too! the mango avocado salad was creamy and delicious! but on the smaller side.

Tacos, the chicken taco was the best of the ones we tried, there was nothing special about the cod (it was too small) and the beef cheek was horrible (little pieces of shredded beef) and the Sunday special Carmita (something like that) was like pulled pork on a bun, it was nice and big and filled, but I thought it would be a taco not a burger.

Overall, the food is OK, but way overpriced (around 5 bucks for a tiny taco) Don't think I would return with so many great Mexican food in the DT area, especially since kensington market is just down the street."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday, short wait but apparently there's and app that estimates wait time (a friend used it so I don't know details). Amazing vibe from a great music selection, good food, and real friendly staff! Only downside is that the musics a bit loud so if you're looking for a quiet place for serious conversation, it might not be ideal. But for us, it was a casual night out - so a perfect venue.

We got a selection of tacos and two starters. I highly recommend the scorpion wings - the bbq sauce is to die for! My favorite taco was the ceviche (if you're into that); chorizo sausage was also super flagrant - this comes in a quesadilla or taco, we got the quesadilla. Portions were small if you're a big guy, but surprisingly filling (guess the beers helped).

Overall great experience and would go again :D"}
{"text":"Amidst Toronto's supple taco scene - La Carnita lands in the middle. The tacos are decent at best, but they are extremely expensive. Sure, they are quite large and full of exotic toppings, but the value just isn't there. The drink selection and quality is not great. The central location (John St.) is always packed, and the service is sketchy at best. Opt for Grand Electric in Parkdale, or 7 Lives in Kensington instead. La Carnita just falls short of delivering on the hype."}
{"text":"I went on a Tuesday night where there was no line up and we got a table right away, so that's a good thing. We sat upstairs in a corner, that you cannot say quiet. The music in this place is extremely loud that you have to scream or get super close to your companion. We started off with the corns as appetizers and that was amazing. Then we tried the tacos. I have to say that I have had better tacos than La Carnita. I was satisfied, but I have to say I was not full, especially for the price we paid. It's a great place to try once, but I don't think I would return."}
{"text":"first night back in toronto from three months of absent i was introduced to La Carnita

i heard no hype, i saw no pop up shop, i just went..

three different types of Tacos, beef, avocado and cod..
beef was soso but cod and avocado was delish.. 
funky decor and old school hiphop is fun, prob be back but not in a rush.."}
{"text":"I never knew this place existed until last week which makes me feel uncool but now that I've discovered it, I feel cool again. La Carnita is a hipster haven. And if you're not a hipster, you can still have a great time because the food is delicious.

You can't say no to $2 pilsner Fridays. The guac is perfectly chunky and equally tasty. Corn on the cob is a must. Various kinds of tacos are available: from cod and ceviche to braised beef and slow-roasted pork. Churros for dessert. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. 

The space is a basement with dim lighting and there are large tables & booths that are good for groups. The music is good, not too loud. Our server was wonderful. And a unique piece of visual art is given out on a postcard with the bill. A memorable touch (it's currently on my fridge). 

The bathrooms are OK but they could do with some flair. Closing is at midnight which is unfortunate because it would be a great late night spot!"}
{"text":"The food is great as usual, but the service and process needs improvement. 

Food delivery was slow to the table, even though there seemed to be many staff members walking around. Especially for a large group, random small amounts of food appeared, with a lot of time between deliveries. Maybe something's up in the kitchen.  

This place still won't split bills for you. The group is left to calculate each portion and tell the staff how much they'd like to pay. The debit machine won't even deduct from the total amount until the table has been fully paid. Everything is manual. What year is this? Buy the right equipment ..."}
{"text":"Went here twice. Would probably need to go again for good measure. The first time was great - the second - not so much. We usually order a mix of tacos and the ribs (sunday special). The ribs were borderline burnt the second time and the tacos not as satisfying. Overall, it is a place i would return to. Good service, good atmosphere and decent price. The tacos do have great flavour compared to others in the Toronto area. Apps are probably what i look forward to most (ordered the corn and meat balls). Didn't die over the drinks...weren't a necessity for me to get again."}

I had been wanting to try La Carnita since finding them and their sister business Sweet Jesus on Instagram. Their instagram feed is always mouth-watering and stunning! So finally we decided to check it out. We arrived at 1130am on a Tuesday just as they were opening which turned out to be perfect timing. The hungry taco lovers that we are, we made sure to order 4 different tacos, the chorizo quesadilla, chips and guac, a mission salad and 2 paletas for dessert. 

The quesadilla was priced at a steep $12.95. It was filling, my first triangle was delicious with the potato crema (although very messily presented on the plate) but I couldn't go back for a second as it was very heavy tasting with nothing to balance the chorizo. 

The chips and guac were delicious!! But I mean please if you serve Mexican style food and can't put together a good guac then what am I doing here?  
Mission salad was also a nice light option to compliment the tacos. 

NOW onto what you're all waiting for..how were the tacos?!?!

Cauliflower Taco:  for me this one was nothing special but my boyfriend ordered it and enjoyed it. The deep fried cheese was a unique touch though. 

Chicken Tinga: this was the daily special and easily the best one! Nutty, creamy and avocado-y chicken-y goodness

In Cod We Trust: fish. tacos. are. my. vice.  The fresh cilantro and cabbage pairs so well with a fried piece of cod. While I did enjoy this one, it's not the best in the city ;)

Carne-... something Idk (the steak taco)
This one was yummy. My boyfriend found the meat on this one underwhelming but I had to disagree. 

We finished off with SJ Paletas for dessert: peach raspberry for me and Keylime for my boyfriend. The keylime was out of this world delicious and I will not likely funk with any other flavour in the future. 

OVERALL: yummy stuff, but with how steep the prices are I'm not about to be converted. We have other amazing go-tos for tacos in the city and we probably couldve got twice as much food as we did for the same price :/"}
{"text":"We came in here while visiting Toronto for a weekend. The place looked lively and we liked the sugar skull signage outside. We sat at the bar and had a few margaritas and a set of tacos. 
   The bartender was nice but not overly friendly or chatty.. he was however, attentive and took good care of us. The margaritas are really good here. I ordered mine with mezcal which in my opinion makes it even better. I love the smoky flavor the mezcal brings to a drink. 
  We had a few tacos with our drinks, I forgot all of what we had but I know there was a cod one and a maybe a carnitas.. either way they were all tasty and a nice way to finish out our outing. I would come back to this spot if I lived in Toronto."}
{"text":"Coming in was a bit confusing. I told the hostess we needed a table for two, there were a few other groups waiting around with us. The the hostess just walked away from her stand. I guess we were supposed to follow her but she didn't address us... it was weird.  My liked my beef cheek taco but not too impressed with the pollo fuego can't put my finger on what put me off.  Street corn was pretty good. My husband got the tortilla chips and bean/queso dip. It was good but it was cold. I expected it to be warm, still good though. So chips, dip, 2 tacos and two ears of corn. $30"}
{"text":"Loud and crowded but thats the feel they want, awesome tacos n dont miss out on the nachos. Awesome awesome joint."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos (In Cod We Trust) and Mexican street corn in town. The corn comes with two pieces so is obviously great for sharing."}
{"text":"This place is dope. Tasty Mexican food, cool vibe, and real hip hop blasting. 

We started with the Mexican Street Corn before we hit the tacos. For the tacos we got the 
Voltron Cod, Pollo Frito, Beef Cheek, and Moke Rojo. All of the food was great, creative, and lived up to the hype from the locals. 

They had a decent bar selection with of course a focus on tequila and Mexican beer. They even have 40oz, keep it OG. I tried the margarita on tap and it was whatever but a few Pacificos later, I was a happy camper."}
{"text":"Yummmmm. Went with a couple of friends after work and got seated immediately. I really like the atmosphere inside- casual but hipster. 

I had the carnita and the cod taco; both good, but preferred the cod. Texture of the carnita was quite pulled apart... and it could have used more crunch to make up for the slightly mushy texture. But the cod was bang on.

We also tried the Mexican street corn, which I thought was really good! The agua fresca was really refreshing too, and my partner had the horchata which was yummy.

I found the prices of the tacos very reasonable, but drinks is where is gets more expensive. I would visit again for the food for sure!"}
{"text":"the tacos here are VERY small! paid $5 for a taco smaller than the palm of my hand... service was poor, and we ordered the tortilla chips which were pretty good. 
We planned to take the chips home but, there was no takeout boxes so we got little plastic cups to put our food in.. wouldn't come back"}
{"text":"I love La Carnita! 

Every time that I go, I have such a good experience. The drinks are tasty, the food is tasty (even for my white girl palette). Although it can be hard to find a table at times, the staff are super friendly. 

If you ever go, the Pollo Frito tacos are my absolute fave. I can't wait to try to the Crispy Cojita. Would recommend to any single person. Even the ones that are on the less spicy side of the spectrum."}
{"text":"**you will always have to wait on weekends if you walk in off the street

I had an hour wait at 730pm but it was worth it. 

The in cod we trust and beef cheek are my favourites. The flavour is amazing in each. 

Each taco is about $5 each. Well worth it."}
{"text":"I love this spot.  

Of all the taco spots popping up, this is my favorite.  They do a great job of putting diverse flavors in such small dishes.  

If you love tacos, you'll love la carnita.  

If you hate tacos, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Waited around 30 mins even though the wait time they told us was 45 mins. (ridiculous) but whatever we wanted to see what the hype was.

The break down: 
Too friggin loud! Holy crap...talk about not being able to unwind or hear the person in front of me. Couldn't even hear the waitress! What the heck...I don't care much about music but it was excruciatingly loud..I got a really bad headache and the ambiance really affected my meal.

We ordered the bean dip (really good)
Beef cheek taco
Pork taco
Chicken taco
Cod taco

For some reason, the flavours/mix of the toppings on the tacos just did not work well with us...not saying they're bad..just saying the flavours did not work for us. They may work for you but we didn't feel as though the flavours really had a 'flow' or 'mix' together well.

Overall, come here if you want to give it a try..."}
{"text":"It's a 3 star from me. Don't get me wrong, I ADORE the tacos here. The fish taco is life changing, but the service was terrible and I can't give them full stars when the servers were just so rude. 

I went with a reservation for a big group of 12 people. Atmosphere-wise the place is loud but feels very rustic. We all ordered our tacos, chips and such. When our food came in, the server came by and passed out our food. At first, it went smoothly. Maybe it was because afterwards more of us joined the table but when the server went to the middle of the table with an order of a Pollo Frito taco, nobody claimed it. We asked to have it taken back and the server said \"are you SURE nobody ordered it?\" We looked around and shook our heads. The server said, \"no the tacos HAS to be here\" and rolled our eyes at us. She came back (probably from checking the chit order or something) and said \"yeah its SUPPOSE to be here.\" She then slammed the tacos on the table. It happened to be the person who joined our table last at the very end, who couldn't hear the order. Human error on our part but that doesn't mean you can be rude. For most of us, it was our first time and I can't say I want to go back with that type of service."}
{"text":"Not great, tacos fillings are ok but don't justify the prices. Average is $5 per taco. Really loud inside as well, service is pretty indifferent. The taco search continues."}
{"text":"Everything is great.  I crave this on a regular basis. Would eat here weekly if prices were a liiiiittle cheaper, but the quality is definitely worth the cost."}
{"text":"I think the prices are very fair for a night out downtown. Went with someone and we got the corn and chips which we split -and 2 tacos each which was more than enough, and it came to about $25 each when we split the bill. 

The atmosphere was almost a club vibe; very dark with loud music. Also we went around 6PM on a Friday and were told it was going to be an hour wait but it only took about 15 minutes to be seated. I would come back here anytime!"}
{"text":"foods were good decent and prices weren't so high. but the services I got from the restaurant was horrible. Servers look angry and was not so nice to customers."}
{"text":"Really tasty tacos, and fresh guacamole. 
Seating space is not the best as tables can get pretty small and tight beside others."}
{"text":"Came for weekday prix-fixe lunch for $15.99 which included choice of appetizer, 2 tacos and dessert.   Very spacious space with popular outdoor seating.  Service was a little slow even though we were the first table.

What i will say is quality of food is very high, fresh and tasty.
For appetizers, we went for the mexican street corn, chips & guac.  Mexican street corn was ok but the chips and guac were excellent.  Serving of chips was huge and it is hard not to eat the whole order.

For the tacos, we chose steak, chicken and ceviche.  Steak was really good.  Size of tacos are small so for the average male, you may need 3 or 4 tacos to get full.  Next time, I will stick to steak and cod tacos and not order ceviche.  Prix-fixe is a good deal considering each taco is about $6 a la carte.

Desserts we chose key lime paleto and churros.  Paleto is really a popsicle.  Churros you get 2 small sticks in a cup but nice way to end the meal.

Overall, really enjoyed the meal.  But at $20 a person for lunch, lots of other options in the area but will not be making this a monthly visit.  But happy to try and see what all the fuss is about."}
{"text":"Overall, a pretty average meal. First impression was that the place was pretty cool, but very loud. As we settled into our meal we adjusted to the volume and as the night went on and the place thinned out it got more manageable to actually have a conversation without feeling like you were shouting or struggling to block out the noise around you to hear the person across the table.

As for the food, the Mexican Street Corn was amazing, and the highlight of the night! Possibly some of the best tasting corn I've ever eaten, and totally worth the $8 price tag. On the flip side, the Mango salad with Avocado was too much avocado, not enough mango, and a pretty underwhelming portion for $8.

Tacos are $5 each and we tried a variety of them including the chicken, chorizo, beef, and cod options. The chorizo is the closest thing to a conventional taco, as the beef is actually served in tostada form which made it a bit awkward to eat. And while I enjoyed the chicken my girlfriend found it too spicy.

2 apps, 6 tacos, 2 pints and 2 bottles of beer = $82 + tip.
I'd say the biggest disappointment was that when I left I was still hungry."}
{"text":"Been a while since visiting any of the La Carnita outposts, and now I've come here for lunch twice in the last month as they do have one of the better patios on this stretch of Eglinton.

I'll be upfront in saying the $6 for a single taco seems too damn high... But they do offer a lunch prix fixe for $15.99 that includes: 
-1 cob of Mexican street corn or guac and chips or the Mission salad.
-2 tacos of your choice
-Dessert (churro or paleta popsicle thing)

I've always loved the corn here, and both the Pollo Frito and Carne Asada tacos are pretty damn good tasting too. Although when I had the daily special taco that was Pulled Pork I will say I was disappointed. On the dessert front, I've tried both the Key Lime and Chocolate Peanut versions of the paleta and will concede they are a decent way to round out a meal.

But even though the food might be right near the 4 star quality mark, we are talking about a lunch that costs $21 minimum per person after tax and tip are taking into consideration, and that's not including a beverage. So given the value factors and the reality that I'll never come here once patio season is gone, 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, was a wait for a table so we headed to the cocktail bar next door, but they called us pretty quickly ( one drink's worth of a wait).
This is a good place to go with one or two people, as it is jam packed and I doubt the tables can accommodate anything more than a group of 6. 
The music is amazing.. The DJ or whoever it was had a good mix of old school and new school, all set to a beat that made you want to get up and dance.... Except there isn't anywhere to do that. 
Had a beef cheek taco and the cod taco. Both were good but the cod definitely won that battle. Ask the server for the drink special because they often aren't on the menu.. And they are very good! Ours was a margarita type concoction which was yummy.
Good food, decent prices, cool atmosphere. 
Definitely will return, thoroughly enjoyed."}
{"text":"Got super sick even more. AVOID unless you want to get sick from their food and spend $20 for it (for two small tacos)"}
{"text":"Lunch special was such a great steal! 1 starter 2 tacos and 1 dessert. Those tacos were so good the waiter was able to make my tacos mild so I enjoyed it way more than having that kick in it. The fresh tuna taco, steak taco, fried cod and chorizo tacos were the ones I had today!! I can't wait to go again to try different ones!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy that they've opened up 2 more locations! I really enjoy the atmosphere of La Carnita especially their music playlist. The wait isn't as long as their College St. location. Always a good time at any La Carnita restaurant. My favourite items on the menu are the mexican street corn, barbacoa ribs, in cod we trust and the churros w/ cajeta sauce!! Their corn is probably one of the best in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Came here twice. First time was on a summer night. DO NOT COME here when it's hot, there is no AC. Second time, we came and it was half full with several empty seats. Both waiters saw us and proceeded to ignore us. When we finally approached them and asked to be be seated, they told us they'll be right with us, but then started to make new drinks. We didn't get it since they could of easily pointed us to the many empty seats. One star for service."}
{"text":"The place receives a 3.5 but I'm rounding it up because presentation and atmosphere were really cool for me. 

My friends and I decided to pop by La Carnita for a quick bite before heading to Sweet Jesus (which is next door but is accessible from La Carnita).  

The tacos here are around $4-7 each but they dress them up nicely so I feel like you're paying for presentation of the food, location, and the design of the restaurant.  

I ordered the day's special - a mixed mushroom empanada that had kale, queso fresco, corn truffle crema, & chipotle. I expected big flavours from this one but it didn't quite hit the spot for me. While the flavours of the mushroom were evident, which I appreciate as a mushroom fan, I feel like the other flavours weren't bold enough in comparison. 

I also ordered the pollo frito which was my favourite - if the empanada was a 3/5, the pollo frito would be a 4.5/5. The pollo frito is made out of crispy chicken thigh, peanut mole, honey, hot sauce, green cabbage, & salsa fresca. The crunchiness of the thigh paired with the crisp of cabbage, the nuttiness and sweetness of the sauce, and the freshness of the salsa fresca was near perfect - I should have ordered two of these. This is my absolute recommend from the taco part of the menu. 

La Carnita has other locations and I have yet to try them out. I like the food they serve, though pricey, the attitude/design of the restaurant (though a bit dark where we sat), and the servers are accommodating, friendly, & helpful (though they were pretty busy which was understandable). I recommend checking this place out, at least for a quick bite - the pollo frito, hands down, is a must-try."}
{"text":"This place gets very crowded and seems to be really popular but I find it to be a bit overhyped, probably because of where it is located. Not to say that the tacos are NOT delicious, because they very much are, but to me this place feels like a lot of others in the city. I don't feel compelled to come back, only if I were in the area. 

I would recommend the carnita taco and the one with crispy chicken. Spicy is definitely spicy with the jalapenos they put it on it. My friend got their specialty appetizer of corn on the cob which I would be interested to try if I come back.

Ambiance is a bit dark (what restaurant isn't nowadays though) and loud! Don't come here expecting to have any intimate conversations. Decor seems to be a cross between grunge and trendy (is that even a good description? hah)."}
{"text":"It was okay, Matt. M and I went to grab a snack before heading to a congee night at a friend's house. We got the fish, raw tuna and their pork special of the day. None of them really wowed us, the pork taco was my favorite out of the three because of the texture of slow cooked and fatty meat! 

Service was great, our server knew we had 30 mins to get in and out and did her best to make sure it happened! 

I would go back when I'm in the area because they had churros and daily specials, but i definitely wouldn't make a trip out there."}
{"text":"Bland, tasteless. Got the 3 piece veggie. Beans tasted like straight from can. No guacamole (it was supposed to come with avocado and guacamole), I didn't taste or find the cauliflower purée. The chipotle sauce was really good though"}
{"text":"Delicious food, nicely presented, and attentive server today - I especially enjoyed the prix fixe menu items - the tacos and mission salad were delicious!  NO COFFEE?! This disappointed both my guest and myself, and seems like a wacky piece of an otherwise good service strategy. I would come back if hot beverages are on offer after a meal."}
{"text":"My 25 year old daughter picked the restaurant to go to for her birthday. I think the target market is a younger crowd with a lot of long cafeteria style seating, blasting music and loud acoustics so you have to shout to be heard. That being said the food is delicious, reasonably priced and service was great."}
{"text":"I knew nothing about this place but I went with friends. Really not impressed.

Firstly, it was incredibly loud. I know music is part of the theme but I could barely communicate with someone right in front of me.

Then there's the food. Cold, soggy and lacking in any real taste. I've had a lot of mexican food both authentic and not, and the offerings here really failed to impress.

The service also left something to be desired. There were a lot of servers around, but getting water and being able to pay was oddly difficult. Our server was busy but seemed to forget about us a few times.

I'd definitely not go again, and neither will my friends."}
{"text":"La Carnita was a restaurant I went to with my friend where we splurged on an assortment of foods that did not disappoint. 

For the sides, mexican street corn tasted great and was very aesthetic. It was a little salty on the bottom but the topping was nice and cheesy. Avocado mango salad was nice and refreshing. Can't go wrong with churros.

For the tacos, the cod was okay. I was expecting a lot because it seemed like it had the best reviews but I thought the fish was under-seasoned and plain. Other tacos I tried were pollo frito (chicken), carne asada (beef steak), and carnitas (pork). All of them were full of flavor and my favorites were the chicken and beef steak. 

The caveat here is that it was very pricy, and prices have gone up. The corn is $9.95. Also close to or over $6 per taco. 

Food: 5
Value: 4
Service: 5 (very attentive, no issues)"}
{"text":"For what it is, La Carnita serves up some decent tacos and drinks in a loud bar type atmosphere. I just expected a little more from the food side. 

We just came here for merely a snack and got the fish and veggie (cheese) tacos. Size was on the smaller size but it still was an acceptable size for a taco. The taco was definitely fresh as the fish was piping hot. I was really taken back by the acidity of the taco (not including the lime). It's a really strong and almost overwhelming kick, combined with the salt, didn't make this my favorite despite liking the fish a lot. I enjoyed the cotija cheese taco more. The pinto beans here gave a nice sweetness and texture that brought together the taco better. I'll definitely return to try their other tacos. 

Service was extremely friendly, made us feel welcome  and we were checked on frequently. 

As many others have said, the music is quite loud in here so having a conversation might be difficult. But otherwise, I really like the atmosphere here. There's a lot of character here and it shows."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a restaurant sign that says \"La Carnita\", you won't be able to find it right away. Instead, look for a restaurant painted in all black, with a Mexican Day of the Dead looking skull on the front. Yep, this place is hipster all right!

I went here for a Sunday night dinner, and it was still fairly busy. We ended up sitting at the bar to eat. We tried their Mexican street corn, it is to die for! It's basically grilled corn on the cob drizzled in an amazingly delicious sauce and dusted with paprika. It's definitely one of their signature dishes. Then, we tried four of their tacos - In Cod We Trust, Pollo Frito, Beef Cheek, and Carnita. My favourite one is definitely the Pollo Frito. It comes with fried chicken pieces on a bed of cabbage and salsa. The chicken is so flavourful, it's hard not to go for seconds on this one.

Also, I would recommend trying their cocktail drinks. I had the Sweet Meesh, which is Mexican Rosee d'Hibiscus beer poured over agave, and the glass is rimmed with organic sugar. It's a nice sweet finish to the meal!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the rice and corn frituras - nice and crispy on the outside and delicious on the inside. The beef cheek and carnita tacos were quite good as well! We also ordered the Friday special (West Coast Rockfish). It didn't fare as well as the beef cheek and carnita tacos - the fish didn't taste very fresh. 

Service was friendly and surprisingly fast for such a packed, chaotic place. I also appreciated that we had plates cleared up once we were finished with a dish."}
{"text":"The tacos as a whole were excellent. We had the Mexican street corn (which I highly recommend), \"In Cod We Trust\", \"Carne Asada\" and \"Mexican Chorizo\" tacos. I was disappointed with the service - since we were inside (and not outside at the patios), we were mostly ignored and it took a while for food to come to our table. It also took twenty minutes for our bill to arrive at our table. Hopefully the other La Carnita locations have better service than this one here."}
{"text":"Not as good as the College St. location (which I love.) Feels more like a Firkin. Mediocre service. Crowded and cramped atmosphere. It may even be more expensive than College St. (the prices didn't seem to match what I remember.) Can't help but think it's for tourists."}
{"text":"Love it. Have been coming here regularly since it opened. My favorite tacos in the city. Their combinations of flavours and textures is unmatched, imho. Also, great starters, cocktails, desserts and staff. 
*****
UPDATE 
Went back a few months after my review and my experience was the polar opposite of what it had been previously. I've been to this restaurant probably a dozen times and this was by far the most disappointing. No one working there seemed to care. Some of the food was cold, the service was indifferent, and not surprising, the place was half empty."}
{"text":"I walked in in Sunday around 5pm with my girlfriend for dinner. The place was huge and no one greeted us at the door. I walked up to the bar and asked if someone was to seat us or if we should find our own table as we had not been there before. The bartender then ran from behind the bar to seat us. He brought drink menus and food menus to the table. We started off with an order of the famous guacamole dip and chips. The guacamole arrived green and brown. It was clear that this was not fresh. It was good but not what we had hoped as reading reviews about this place usually brought up the amazing guacamole dip. We then proceed to order tacos which were made to order and very quickly brought to the table. We ordered steak and fish tacos which were delicious. We finished our meal with churros and they were delicious as well. From my experience at this location I feel that maybe the downtown location is better and will try it out next time I am on college street."}
{"text":"First thing that I have to say is that I have had a lot of Mexican and Tex-Mex all over Canada and the US.
I love the atmosphere, it is just beautiful and very clean. The staff is also great.
We had the tacos, for lunch. I think they were ok, as I really didn't get to take the meat or the fish. They came loaded with guacamole, said and cheese.
I would probably go there if i was around the area, but wouldn't make a trip though."}
{"text":"I think the success of this place has gotten to their heads. The service is well below par and the food seems to have gotten downhill since it opened. The downtown location is much better. There is much better mexican in Toronto at cheaper or similar prices with better service. I won't be going back to this one and I'd suggest looking at other great options in the area. 

I'd suggest the owner of this place look for better staff or at least train them and put a bit more attention to detail on the customer experience."}
{"text":"The worst.  We didn't even get inside.

Arrived at 6:15 for a table of two and was told the wait would be 30 mins.  Only a few tables in front of us.  There were a few empty tables in the restaurant so was puzzled, but put name down anyways.

Returned half an hour later and was told that we were behind two tables and it would be 10 minutes.  Looked around and there were still empty seats, at the bar and in the dining room.

10 mins later a group shows up and says they have 15 people.  They were seated in 5 minutes.  This is a place that is first come first serve, no reservations, and they still chose to seat the bigger party.  Was annoyed but regardless assumed we would be next.  5 tables had left the restaurant so we HAD to be next.

10 mins later still not seated and she says almost there.  A group of women show up and ask us how long the wait is and we tell them apparently it's 45 mins to an hour.  They walk in and say they have a party of 10 (I even overhear them saying \"lets just say a bigger party so they seat us\"). I literally am right there when the hostess says \"Next time please tell us ahead of time so we can seat your large party, because there are a lot of people waiting for tables.  We will seat you this time.\"  

At that point it is 7:15 and they said you're next we are just getting the table ready.  We wait 10 minutes and leave.  They try calling back another 10 mins after saying our table is ready.  I explained I saw them seat parties right away because they were bigger even though they didn't have to wait.  No way are we waiting around for service like that.  They apologized and try to say that it didn't happen. 

I understand trying to maximize profit but seriously making people wait that long and seating other parties because they are larger?  It's not like these were set tables.  I saw the team putting smaller tables together!  Horrible experience.  There are many places on King that will treat you better and are much more organized than this place."}
{"text":"WOW this place sucks! Toronto as a city has to stop supporting terrible restaurants like this, this place just shows what some social marketing savvy and getting the hype-train behind you can do....where do I start???

five dollars for a taco the size of a cracker... you need at least 4 to fill you up... they are not even good, the fish taco was watered down by the overload of sauce, the chicken wasn't great either.... 

8 dollars for two pieces of corn with mayo and spices on it.....

11 dollars for a mojito that tasted like old trident toothpaste

five dollars for a churo cut into 3 pieces

oh and dont forget about the waitresses who come around with sparkling water refilling your drink making NO mention of the 7 dollar a bottle cost of it!!!

seriously this place sucks, the food is sub average, prices are insane, they play the same uninspired music way to loud, this place is just a marketing experience executed well.. the actual food... and for what should matter is no good, and if you come here to be in the \"scene\" i feel sorry for you"}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me, knows that I flat out LOVE Mexican food!  So, when one of my friends suggested we have dinner here (after a failed attempt at grabbing dinner at another Mexican spot), I was all over it!

It was an absolutely gorgeous night out, so I was thrilled to be able to sit on their small sidewalk terrace for our meal.  The inside was crammed with people, lined up for inside tables - which was odd given that it was so nice outside - anyway, I digress.

Rather than wait in line for an inside spot, we opted for terrace anyway and were seated immediately.  We ordered the Mexican Street Corn, 3 different tacos (Cod, Chicken and Ceviche)...all were delicious!

One of the things I like about this place is the low price point.  We got a lot of food for what we paid, we were able to sit outside and enjoy our meal, while we lingered over our beers and never once felt like we were being rushed off the table to make room for someone else once they brought us our bill.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"After realizing la carnita opened up a new location right next door, I jumped at the most immediate opportunity to try it out. I've been to the original location on college and have experienced the infamous wait times so I was pleasantly surprised that this location consists of 2 stories, is MUCH bigger and no lineup!

I tried their Mexican sweet corn for the first time and thought the corn was SO sweet and juicy and perfectly charred. I've never tried dressed up corn on the Cobb before and liked the play on flavours - party in your mouth!

The tacos on the other hand were a bit of different story... the beef cheek and the carnita (pork) and felt that they were excessively saucy and the tortillas were just limp and inspiring.. The cod tacos that came next were better as anything with lots of pickled cabbage wins my vote. 

My main complaint is that the tacos are tiny!! After downing a whole thing of corn + 2 tacos which is almost $20 pp including tax and tips, I left the place still hungry and ended up having a second dinner. I feel like the average person will need at least 4 tacos each to feel full.

The service was excellent and very attentive and so I think I'll be back again sometime as I'm a sucker for Mexican food and this is such a convenient location. But maybe some improvements on the tacos please?"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place got anything lower than 5. I've lived in the ATL and been Texas many times. These are some of the best tacos I ever had! Service was great. Price is steep, but good food ain't cheap."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Mexican place in Toronto.

The corn on the cob is just to die for!

Tacos are really good too, and the desserts are fantastic.

Great selection of drinks, beers and wine as well. 

I have been there 3-4 times, and I am always excited about going back!"}
{"text":"SO disappointed, I love all the college st. and john st. la carnita locations, so i was really excited when this one opened up. Came here for brunch on a Sunday morning around noon, it was really empty with only one other table. It was very dark in there, but the decor was nice. and the waitress was very friendly.

They only had their brunch menu available. We got the Eggs Benny Empanada, it was extremely small for $20! I could have eaten it in 4 bites, definitely not a main at all, almost snack sized. It wasn't a traditional one, it was circlular with a thinner crunchy crust. The filling was excellent and had a great spice, but the hollandaise crema was completely cold! We also got a few breakfast tacos, the steak (add an egg for extra $) and the chorizo. 

For the empanada, and 3 tacos, with 1 extra egg it costed $50, we were both not full at all and left hungry still."}
{"text":"A great place to go for fish tacos and corn! We went on Mother's Day and making a reservation was pretty easy. The John st location is attached to Sweet Jesus as well for dessert afterwards."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Not accommodating to certain dietary requests. Bad attitude of certain servers."}
{"text":"First, the really good things: cozy, clean, cool looking interior. Service was very good.  Cocktails were delicious. 

The food was terribly underwhelming. We had the nacho chips with all three dips. For tacos we had the fried cod, carne asada, fried chicken and the fried cojita cheese. Everything was just...ok. There wasn't one thing I ate that made me want more. I found the food to be unbalanced (too much acid) and just lacking flavour, which is crazy when you consider the ingredients. 

I wouldn't go back, there are much better tacos elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love the food here but you could use a few more taco selections. They aren't really big enough also. I get the Tuna taco and the Beef Cheek but my wife gets the cheese one because she is a vegetarian. It would be nice if you had a couple more veggie options but oh well. BEST GUAC AND CHIPS IN THE CITY!!! The corn is to die for! I don't normally eat corn because it gives me digestion problems but I eat it from here anyways because that is how much I love it! It is also unfortunate that you do not separate bills."}
{"text":"How I dint know about this place? The ribs are amazing, they only have them on Sundays I think, they are really soft, almost like melting in your mouth. We tried the carnita tacos with a mango salad, it wasn't my fav I'm not a fan of the mango salad in the tacos to be honest, and the tortillas... Didn't like the tortillas, too soft and weak, didn't hold my taco. The churros were good, but the Best item of all were the Popsicles!! Please try them."}
{"text":"I ate at the John st. location a few times and I always enjoyed the food there.  However, I tried this location for the first time tonight with my husband (it was his first time trying out La Carnita altogether) and we would definitely not come back.  We sat down and it took 10 min before someone came to take our drink order.  Hubby ordered the special drink of the day, which was a $5 mexican tall boy, and it tasted like a very light beer with an odd aftertaste.  We ordered empanada (1 big one for $8) and 3 tacos (fried eggplant, beef steak, and chorizo).  The tacos were not bad but it was very small for the price.  Our waitress never checked in on us once.  After we finished everything, it took another 10 min to flag down our waitress, which we couldn't - she kept going around to all the tables around us to take orders.  We had to get out of our seat, walked over to the waitress to tell her to get us the bill.  I was very tempted to dine and dash.  She dropped off the bill on our table and left.  We figured if we paid by card, who knows how much longer we would've had to wait for her to come back with machine, so we put down cash, and left.  We just wanted to get out of there because the service was next to non-existence - we didn't even want to wait for change.  The bill came out to $34 and change, and we just put down $40 and dashed.  $40 for 1 sub-par tallboy, 1 empanada, and 3 baby tacos.  We've eaten at tons of restaurants - from cheapo ones to fancy ones, so we have no problem shelling out the money, but it has to be worth it.  This place was NOT WORTH IT.  I'm a petite person and I almost always never finish my food, and we would almost always have to get a doggy bag for leftover.  This was the first time in my life I left a restaurant, still hungry.  You know the restaurant is bad when you have to grab a burger from A&W after you leave.  

If you have plenty of time to kill and want to overpay for baby sized tacos, this place is a MUST TRY!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! The food was so good! I've never enjoyed a veggie taco so much. It's a cool atmosphere but it's a loud place, I could barely hear my friend over the noise. I would definitely come back and eat here again."}
{"text":"See our video review here: https://youtu.be/0u-jKLoAwi0 A top taco place in the city. You can't go wrong with their fish and carnita taco. That voltron sauce kicks it up and you can taste the fresh ingredients. Also they have a drink called the OG chelada that is beer, with chilli pepper rimmed cup."}
{"text":"Loud, crowded but good! It gets pretty but it's worth the hype. The fish taco is my favourite and they make pretty good drinks."}
{"text":"Honestly the food quality of this restaurant is not bad, and I am just so amazed by their service:

1. We waited for 20 minutes until one waiter saw my waving hand and sensed my \"hangry\" vibes and came to our table to place our order 
2. Messed up our order twice 
3. Was told that the wrong item would be waived but got charged for it anyways"}

Specialty: Tacos
Menu items: Mexican Street Corn, In Cod We Trust & Featured Pork Tacos and Churros

La Carnita is the newest addition to the many Mexican-inspired joints that have debuted in the past year in Toronto. In my opinion, its the best Taco joint in the city. Here's why...

Starting off with the most amazing street-style, down and dirty, delicious, well put together mess that is the Mexican Street Corn.

This corn on the cob is perfectly grilled and smothered in fresh cream (crema), aged cheese (queso anejo) and arbol & ancho chili powder. As with any spicy dish, the addition of cream balances it off so well, that one's bite turns from fiery to yummy in the split of a second, and one can not help but continue to sink one's teeth onto the cob, until no corn is left.

La Carnita's menu is versatile and as the owner's say - a work-in-progress. So every other day, they offer a featured taco that is not on the regular menu. When I visited, a very tasty Braised Pork taco was stealing the spotlight.
The taco shell was quite fresh, tasty and warm; which is usually how taco shells are served in Mexico. Brownie points to La Carnita for this. On it, a Yucatan braised pork meat was sitting on a bed of guacamole and covered with pickled onions, cilantro, Jicama orange salsa and aged cheese (queso anejo). So what exactly is Jicama? you might wonder...Jicama is a sweet, root vegetable that looks like a turnip. In Mexico, where it originated, it's usually eaten raw and soaked in lemon juice with salt and pepper. So as you can imagine, when I heard Jicama, I immediately had to go for this taco. As a side note, the use of such ingredients and combinations by the Carnita chef demonstrates his knowledge of world food and true Mexican inspiration.

Because my trust for La Carnita was rising as I tried more dishes, I decided to fully devote myself to their famous In Cod We Trust taco.
The taco is as heavenly as it sounds. The secret? Probably the Voltron sauce (no Mexican translation, refer to 90s cartoon), which to this date, is only known to us patrons as a top secret Asian-inspired sauce. In addition to the sauce, the perfectly beer-battered fried cod, cilantro, lime cream and julienne apple and pickled cabbage slices, are a combination that one must order when at La Carnita. It's juicy, its crunchy, its just simply delicious.

To finish off your meal, La Carnita offers two desserts on the menu, the \"Paletas\" which are basically ice Popsicles turned gourmet with funky flavours and ingredients that change on any given day. The second, the famous Mexican Churros.
Three crunchy, sweet and flavourful churros come dipped in a cup with house-made cajeta. Cajeta is a Mexican caramel with a more dense texture than regular caramel. It also uses sheep's milk, which gives it a unique ooey-gooey taste. A bite on these \"stick-looking\" sweet delights will make any meal go from good, to great!

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed it here: way better than what I was expecting. 
Atmosphere was lively and fun but not toooo loud. My cod taco was truly delicious, as were the corn (with a little spice and cheese - yum!) and meatballs (although suprisingly spicy). The scallop ceviche appetizer was a bit of a let-down. It was fine, but nothing special for $12. Cocktails were excellent and reasonably priced. I'm happy we got a \"normal\" table and not one of the bench-style for sharing with strangers; that might have soured the experience a bit.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Have to agree with other reviewers, there's nothing special about this place. We had a group and they refused separate bills, which is particularly difficult to calculate at a place where each person orders a million sides and small tacos. The food came at all different times so some people were done while others were starving. The tacos were ok but nothing particularly special, and frankly it's pretty pricey once your start adding things up. We had one waiter who was wonderful and the only reason why I wouldnt give this place a lower rating, plus the DJ downstairs did a great job in providing some retro throwbacks. Overall it was fine for a large group birthday - my reason for attending - but not worth a recommendation and not a reason to go back."}
{"text":"Overpriced and pretentious Mexican restaurant. It's suffering from a MAJOR identity crisis, it wants to have a down to earth divey vibe but prices a lame margarita at $9. The staff should learn to check their over it attitude at the door. There are so many places I could start. The pretentious hostess who would have rather been sitting at the bar (which is where she eventually ended up towards the end of our dinner), the unaccommodating waiter, the over load of lime in the guacamole, or maybe the ridiculous price for small tacos with barely anything inside. I expect a host or hostess to make us feel welcome in the restaurant, not like we maybe should have picked a different location. We experienced the latter. We were brought upstairs to the second level dining area with a plethora of open tables to seat a party of 2 but she decided to sit us cramped up directly next to another table of 2. The waiter took incredibly long to come take our order, even our very nearby neighbors were looking for him to pay their bill.  Due to some dietary restrictions we asked if a salad was customizable, specifically changing a dressing to one that didn't include dairy and to include a protein, after all this was going to be my dinner. The answer was a flat NO we don't do that. I ended up not being able to order anything on the menu and was going to settle on picking a few chips from the chips and guacamole that we ordered. Unfortunately, they drop a tremendous amount of seasoning all over the chips (looked like chili powder) and douse the guac with lime. It was so acidic and completely inedible. The tacos my husband ordered were so small and just were not enough to be a proper dinner portion, and filling up on the chips and guac ended up not being an option. It's a bummer because I was hoping this place would become a go-to place for quality Mexican and it just is not. Overall, the price for their tiny tacos is ridiculous considering the amount of food you're getting, don't order the guac and, if you can FIND A DIFFERENT Mexican restaurant to eat at do it."}
{"text":"Amazing place for tapas and drinks
Loved the ambience, great for happy hour or just getting together with friends for a  few drinks"}
{"text":"Tried each of the tacos.  They were good but was expecting more after all the really positive reviews.  My favorite was the fish taco."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! But the management is too pretentious. This place has so much potential but has dissatisfied so many customers with their attitude."}
{"text":"Love the look of this place and each time I have gone there has been tons of energy.  Really charging up that block again.  side comment: Come on Teatro - fix your washrooms and pick up your socks!

The positive:

- decor = fun and well executed
- drinks = well priced, yummy, not too over conceived
- crowd = young, social, well dressed - not too hipster
- Food = pretty tasty, especially the fish tacos

The negative:

- service = nothing special, lots of whizzing by

Real weak spot is the menu is essentially street food & small, so after two visits, I had tried everything and felt ready for cutlery again.  Now I use it as a pre-drink place for Woodlot, especially because I love Michalitas(sp)

Will go back, but hope they revamp the menu - or really expand it!

I recommend you check it out, could be a fun date...but don't plan to date your life by it..."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is sooo good! And i love that you can mix and match with your tacos. The service isn't that great, but the food is good enough that I don't care. This can be a little pricey if you are a big eater but I personally find it quite filling. I will definitely be going again and will bring more friends with me. 
Tip: if you're going make sure to save some space and visit Sweet Jesus next door for some amazing ice cream!"}
{"text":"Came here for a bday and the vibe was bumping.  We almost didn't find this place because there no sign but we figured it out and know for life.

We ordered all the apps and all the tacos.  My fav being the fish or beef cheeks.

Solid solid solid spot and will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"We went around 2pm on a friday afternoon. I waited too long be seated, then waited too long to get drinks/orders placed. We waited about an hour for 4 tacos (2 cod,2 beef cheek). They were cold (and the beef cheek looked pre-chewed). People were seated after us and left before we even got our food. Clearly, someone made an error. We mentioned the wait and got shrugs , and I would have forgiven them but then we waited another 20 min for the bill. I had to approach a random staff member to get it at all. They gave me the bill, and we never did see the waiter again. I threw some cash on the table and booked it.

 I was so freaking excited to go here (as I had a great experience at the College St. location) and I was left sooo disappointed. I just wanted out of this place.The staff was friendly, but I think I will try again in a few months when they have their shit together. 

silver lining: I got ice cream after ."}
{"text":"Drinks are well made here and the tacos are amazing...the chicken peanut sauce was one of the most flavorful things I've ever had...one of the best taco places in the GTA.

Not a fan of the picnic table seating where elbows are touching and you can't have a private conversation."}
{"text":"This was one of the most disappointing experiences in Toronto. Fellow yelpers let me down as I expected great food based on the reviews. On the plus side, we were seated quickly without reservations on a busy Saturday night - I think that's all I have for the plus side. We ordered the three dips and chips (photo), a variety of tacos, salad, sangria and a margarita. The tacos were decent, nothing to rave about... I am compelled to write this review because the guacamole was basura. The guac had the texture of a vitamix recipe with no evidence of avocado chunks or flavor. It wouldn't bother me if guacamole were terrible anywhere else but this place is clearly Mexican inspired and needs to be renamed if they are going to serve such terrible guac.  The drinks were great so if you do go I'd recommend the bar but make plans for dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food and service! The food comes quickly which was great since we were super hungry.  The tortilla chips was amazing with all three dips. The corn was average, definitely not worth the $9. However, the cod taco was by far the best fish taco I've ever had. Must try!"}
{"text":"The food was okay but the drinks are a total burn. We ordered a pitcher of sangria and knew it was $50 but figured it would be good for that price. If it was $10 I would say the same - it was a ripoff. Between two people neither of us felt any effects of alcohol at all. It was a pitcher of lemonade, way too much ice, and two sliced strawberries on top. 

Worst sangria in Toronto. Avoid!!!"}
{"text":"I came to this place with my gf when it was completely empty.   I asked for a patio table that had 4 seats cause I didn't want to seat on the high tables they have for 2 people. Had to argue with the waiter for 10 mins to get seated. He didn't want to seat me cause he said they will get busy. They never got busy. The food is good but the portions are small. I'd rather go to banh mi boys.  Their tacos are way better."}
{"text":"Came here early on a Saturday evening after a long day of shopping. We didn't have a reservation, but there was a table for two available. We ordered two In Cod We Trust (breaded cod), one Crispy Cotija (breaded cheese) and one el pastor (daily special, braised pork belly), as well as chips and guacamole. The tacos were all delicious. Great blend of flavours, and a decent size for the price. The guacamole and chips were excellent, with a nice hint of spiciness. The server knew the menu really well and made great recommendations based on how hungry we were. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I first visited la Carnita by accident while going for a walk on College St on a Saturday night. The moment I walked it, I could feel the energy and it was an amazing place to meet up with some friends for some great Tacos!

Even though the wait list was an hour, I managed to find a couple of seats the bar to begin our culinary delight. They had a great selection of beer are on tap and once the bartender handed the menu our culinary experience began.  

The tacos were out of this world, looking at the price they seemed to be expensive for a taco but they are amazingly filling and full of flavor. I strongly recommend getting the beef cheek and pork tacos. They had a scallop ceviche  on special and I wish had more and if they have it on special, GET IT!!!

Needless to say, I'm counting down the days till I go back to La Carnita."}
{"text":"I didn't realize there was a second location aside from the one on King street west. However this location has less traffic as opposed to the other location. In terms of wait, on weekends, be prepared to you haven't made reservation.
The atmosphere is loud and it's quite chaotic, but it's controlled. If you're looking for a cultural TexMex vibe, look elsewhere, though it's clean it tries to give off a grungy vibe.
But coming here, our party knew we were here for some food. Prior to our culinary adventure, we ordered rounds of their Tromba Blanco tequila, by far the smoothest I've ever had!
For foods, it was all tacos, Saturdays special was their chorizo y papas (Spanish sausage y potatoes) $4.95 which was a delight and had a spicy kick to it.
Other tacos notably devoured was their Carnita and In Cod We Trust (fish) which were the same price as the special. In terms of tacos, they've got a list caters to vegetarians and the same for those tequila aficionados.
Overall La Carnitas on College was an experience, the people and servers are chilled out and always providing you recommendations."}
{"text":"This is the cutest restaurant everrrrr. Their portions are pretty small, but i love it cuz it gives you the chance to order a-few different food. I love Mexican food and i tried this place once, and I definitely go back. Their FISH TACOS are the BESTTT. Trust me if you are like me and kinda picky with fish,  YOU GONNA LOVE IT. Go nuts and order lots."}
{"text":"This review is for the John location. I came on a Thursday night (during TIFF), and the wait was about 20-30 minutes. They are one of the few places that take your number down and text you when they have a table, which was great!

Ambiance: The music inside was loud. Really loud. I could barely keep up with our conversations because of it.

Service: It also took us a long time to be served. I'll let this one pass this time though, because it could be due to TIFF and how busy it was (even though they should have been prepared for this).

Food: We ordered the chips with three dips (corn salsa, guac, and bean dip). Next time - I would just go for the guac. SO GOOD. I could have done without the corn salsa and bean dip. I also had the Thursday special (duck taco) - which was REALLY spicy. I could barely eat it... I feel like the waiters should mention this when people are ordering it. I also had the Carnita taco, which was amazing.

Overall: The meal was average. The ambiance was cool, but only if you are going with someone that you don't want to have a conversation with."}
{"text":"'Squid The Kid' crispy squid tacos, hands down most delicious tacos I ever tasted. Mexican streetcorn and nachos with guac are absolutely delicious, and the churros were heaven."}
{"text":"Went here after work with my girlfriend for drinks and tacos. We heard there was long lineups to get seated but surprisingly we got seated right away(at 8 PM) on a friday night. The interior was dimly lit and the music was loud but not too loud that you couldnt have a conversation. 

We ordered three different tacos, the daily special, the mexican chorizo, and carne asada. All the tacos were amazing and has great flavour. We also had the tortilla chips with the three dips; guac, corn salsa, and spicy bean and smoked queso. The dips were great, my favourite being the corn salsa. 

I had a great time and the price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Absolutely divine tacos. Got the Carnita, In Cod We Trust, and some other fish taco. Everything was amazing and I licked my fingers clean. The guac and chips were also great because the chips had a bit of spice to them! We finished with Palatas: I highly recommend the Key Lime Pie. Would 100% return."}
{"text":"Food is great, like the music, but service leaves a lot to be desired. After 12 drinks between 3 of us, appetizers, and the 5th round on the way we were informed at 3 hours into the visit that there was a 2 hour max that now had to be enforced due to the wait at the door. Now I appreciate they are a hot spot and want to keep wait times reasonable, but 1) tell us the 'limit' up front, not 3 hours in and when we've ordered a 5th round, 2) apply it to everyone and at a times if it is indeed the policy, 3) take reservations and let people reserving know of said limit, and 4) don't come back 5 minutes after you just served us to remind us of the wait at the door - my drink is full and until it's not please don't hustle me out."}
{"text":"Bringing tacos to Riverside, at first the east end location of the hip La Carnita is hard to spot with its intentionally nondescript storefront. But since they opened a Sweet Jesus outlet at the front, suddenly it is much easier to find it. How can anyone miss a place where a modest crowd has gathered for ice cream and leaves a obnoxious sticky mess throughout in their wake?

Dingy dark inside like how so many other hipster places like it like that, I was surprised at how deep the \"hole-in-the-wall\" square footage is (I don't recall the Rasputin bar it replaced being that big). Stopping a few notches short of turning the 'hood I grew up in into another Ossington Avenue scene (no thanks), the music here is bloody ghetto-blasting loud! I have to ponder if the child sitting a couple tables down from me (hey, this is Queen East, not Queen West) has gone nearly deaf after this ordeal.

Other reviews here have portrayed the service as up and down and even snobby; I was generally satisfied with the responsive service I got. The only qualm was that it took an unusually long time to bring our Sweet Jesus branded paleta dessert bars to us (go for Key Lime Pie). It's not like they made that stuff to order.

The tacos, we tried a bunch. None was spicy as I would have liked it. The cod was definitely the best of the bunch with the nice soft sexy fish meat playing well with the rest of the ingredients. At around $5-6 each, you shouldn't go crazy with the order. Unless, I suppose, that's what you want to do. They arrive surprisingly quite quickly to you, much faster than Kensington Market's Seven Lives could ever pull off.

As for the off-putting olfactory qualities of the restaurant that some have reported, what smell? Maybe they fixed whatever it was long before I got around to trying this location out."}
{"text":"Great food, I tried the chicken, beef cheek and the fish. And I loved it. And the desert is amazing."}
{"text":"Had the beef cheek taco. Even though it was fresh and tasted really good, it wasn't authentic Mexican flavor. Too many things were going on and not enough Mexican hot sauce. Don't get me wrong, it was still a satisfying taco. Just that it was not authentic Mexican.  The OG was cold, hot, and delicious! I'd give this place 5 stars if the taco was more authentic but I'm definitely going to be here again."}
{"text":"This is an example of where a chef tries to make good old tried and true recipes into trendy dishes and fails utterly. We ordered margaritas, the 3 dips with tortilla chips, a cod taco, and a bean cheese taco. Although it sounded interesting, some of the flavours just didn't go together. The Pickled carrots on a peice of fried cheese taco with beans, sounded cool but just tasted weird! The worst, however,  was the cod taco, the fish was dark and over-fried with shredded beets. I'm not sure how you can screw up guacamole but even that was not good. The bean dip looked AND tasted like pureed hot dogs. I love interesting combos of food, I'm not a picky eater. I  had high hopes for this place but the food was gross. The margaritas and the corn dip were good though!"}
{"text":"La Carnita is a very very busy place. If you don't make reservations for a large group on a Friday or Saturday night (or afternoon), then come back the following week with a reservation.

I find the tacos to be a bit small, but all in all very flavourful with all the ingredients topped high. It may cause for a few messy bites, so ensure you have a few extra napkins nearby. 

I have had the In Cod We Trust taco. The fried piece of fish seems to be disproportionate to the size of the taco. The fish is fried well with the right hint of lime crema (the sour note).

The Carnita taco was not my favourite as the ingredients are a bit dry. The pork itself is dry, but seasoned well.

I come here every time for the mexican street corn. Two pieces for $9 topped with chilli powder mayo. If you don't like the extra kick of the chilli powder you can definitely ask to omit the powder as it is sprinkled on top of the mayo. The corn is charred to perfection. This gets a bit messy to eat, but is very  very enjoyable! If you stick to the basics, who doesn't like corn and mayo?"}
{"text":"Pretty good place...glad they take reservations. Menu is small and there aren't a lot of options for you if you don't eat meat, but the fish and corn tacos I had were tasty. Music is good, though a tad loud. I'm dinging a star fo the sangria....made the mistake of ordering a pitcher, and at $55 it is a total rip off!. The pitcher had an insane amount of ice and if there was any alcohol in there, it was not discernable. We may as well have been downing juice boxes.  Seriously, make this drink properly or remove it from the menu."}
{"text":"If you don't like cilantro, don't go here. They will be incredibly rude to you and will refuse to take even the smallest steps to accommodate you.

Some people (a minority to be sure) experience a soapy chemical taste when eating cilantro. I'm one of those people, so eating at Mexican places is always a toss-up. On the one hand, I love every other flavour in Mexican cuisine, and my friends all love Mexican too. On the other hand, the presence of even a small amount of cilantro in a dish--undetectable to those who don't have the same genetic code--can spoil that dish for me and ruin my night. I know I'm not the only person who reacts this way to cilantro (there are websites, and blogs, and online communities).

So I was a bit nervous going to La Carnita, as I am with most Mexican places. However, my friends had saved a table (no easy feat in this place) for my girlfriend and I, so I felt that I owed it to them to give them a chance. They said they'd talked to a male server when they first sat down about the cilantro issue and he was apologetic that most of their food contained it (again, totally understandable for a Mexican restaurant) but their impression was that he would check what he could do. Then a female server came and asked us for our order. I explained my aversion to cilantro to her and she told me that I should just order the corn because it's the only thing without cilantro. I asked if it was just a garnish on some of the tacos, and she told me that yes, it was just a garnish on the Cod taco. I asked if they could just put it on the side for me instead of putting it on as a garnish. She got incredibly rude and said \"No. You can pick it off if you don't want it. We don't make any modifications to our tacos.\"

...

This totally blew my mind. I've never been to a place that was so rude and inflexible. I understand that it's risky business going to a Mexican restaurant when I have a cilantro aversion, but usually they at least make an attempt to be accommodating. In this place I felt like they were saying \"Hey, we don't need you--look at the lineup to get in. You can either eat the food our way or get out.\" I felt terrible in this situation because my friends, who had been waiting at the table for me, no longer wanted to stay either after such a negative interaction. Overall it was the single worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant and it was solely because of the service and our server.

I'm sure if you're ok with cilantro then this place is great, based on the other reviews that I can see on here. But if you can't eat cilantro, save yourself and everyone you're with the time and frustration and head to a mom-and-pop Mexican place, rather than one started by an ad agency."}
{"text":"Melt. In. Your. Mouth. Delicious. Taco. Porn."}
{"text":"Have to say I expecting to be underwhelmed with all the hype that La Carnita had from TUM (Toronto Underground Market) but holy smokes, I had one of the best dinners I've had in a while here.

Should preface this that they have a small menu (3 apps, 4 tacos and 2 or 3 desserts) and there's really not much choice but everything they had was pretty good but what was great was that everything went really well together. 

We started off with the corn (which were the juiciest cobs I've had in a while - definitely street style) and chips (which were good but nothing special), and tried each one of their tacos and each were delicious (the chicken was okay).

I think what surprisingly ended this meal off for me were the churros. They were small and slightly crispy but very airy and the chocolate dip was perfect.

Pricing wise it was a little high (with drinks, tip and tax the dinner came to about $50 / pp, but could've easily been $30, we just went all out) but it's worthwhile to give this place a try if you're looking for something different.

The atmosphere here is pretty interesting as well, good hip hop playing in the background, and large seating area in the back, it's a nice casual but trendy place to hit up on College st!"}
{"text":"Really, really good tacos that you order individually for about $4-5 each.  This gives the opportunity to try a few different things -  I especially liked the cod, fried chicken and chorizo tacos.  The street corn was also really delicious and the paletas? (Mexican popsicles) were the perfect end to a great meal.  My only complaint would be the extremely loud hip hop music - during one meal I was seated directly under a speaker and was unable to carry on a proper conversation!"}
{"text":"I am too old for this place; La Carnita is a Mexican-inspired modern/fusion restaurant.  I have no idea if the bathroom is accessible because I couldn't reach it.  Full disclosure; I went on a Saturday night with my BFF.  I don't normally go out to \"popular\" places on a Saturday because I hate busy places.  And THIS PLACE WAS SO BUSY!

The food was delicious but NOT vegan friendly.  There are LOTS of vegetarian options, but I wouldn't bring a vegan because most of the non-meat dishes are covered in cheese.  

My BFF and I ordered the nachos with salsa, cheese and guacamole.  It was VERY good!  In fact, everything we ordered was delicious.  I would have ordered more if I had had room in my belly.

My ideal for this place would be if I could order food to go.  I can't deal with being squashed next to the person next to me, able to hear all of their conversation.  I like space and quiet.  This place has neither.  

I would return here if La Carnita didn't have such problematic issues with social media.  For those of you unaware, please find articles about it here:

I know that La Carnita has addressed the issue, but I'm not comfortable returning."}
{"text":"Amazing dining experience! I haven't tried their original location, only because I hate lines. A La Carnita loving friend suggested that we venture over to Queen E to try the latest outpost - and the entire experience was a hit.

We came on Friday just after 6pm and there was absolutely no wait. When we left, around 7:30pm, it was the same situation - people were coming in and were seated immediately. I'm not sure if my experience was abnormal, so if it is - I apologize for getting your hopes up!

We tried the tortilla chips with the bean dip and they were a great starter - the chips were nice and warm, lightly dusted with ancho chili powder. The chips were great on their own, you didn't even need the dip... though we definitely scraped the bottom of the bowl.

I had the In Cod We Trust, Big Sur and the Carnita taco. I have absolutely no complaints - the flavours were great and the Big Sur was enough for me to want to return on a Friday night. It was amazing. The server had said that the tacos were small, but three tacos were more than enough to feel full.

Of course we had to finish off with the churros. You have three long pieces, perfect for sharing, with a great dip. They were hot, fresh and I probably could have polished off a second order.

Great beer list, everything priced at $7/pint, which is fairly reasonable for Toronto. I didn't find the music that loud and I had no trouble carrying on a conversation with my dining companion. The service was spot on - my only worry about attending this place with a group would be the fact they don't do separate checks. 

All in all, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"La carnita is more hype and hip than substance.  The atmosphere is partially natural brick adorned with unnatural graffiti.  Maybe it is the acoustics, but the place is teaming with people screaming at each other as if they were at a club.

So, the menu...

Its pretty good, and would probably be very good if it were not for the fact that I expected more.  There is a solid selection of bottled Canadian microbrews, and a few cocktails that were thrown together.  A margarita will run you $11 and isn't worth it.

They had 5 tacos ($5 each) on the menu the day I went.  They were:

\"In Cod We Trust\" - Voltron sauce, lime crema, pickled red cabbage, green apple and cilantro.
  * This was the best taco and I'm sorry that I had it first.  It is really very good.  Its a piece of battered cod with fixings and whatever voltron sauce may be.

\"Pollo Frito\" - Penut mole sauce, pickled green cabbage & salsa fresca.
  * why is it mole sauce and salsa fresca? Why not chocolate sauce, and fresh sauce or salsa mole & salsa fresca? Anyway, its a thai spring roll in a flour torilla.  Its average.

\"Red & Green Chorizo\" - Housemade chorizo, mango salsa, pickled onion, queso cotija & cilantro.
  * Taco bell-esque.

\"Carne Asada\" - Skirt Steak queso añejo, lettuce, salsa verde.
  * I didn't like it, but it is complete bias.  I'm not a huge fan of añejo and it is definitely the most prominent taste.  Try it, the beef was cooked medium rare.

\"Crispy Avocado & Frijoles\" - Beans, crispy avocado, jimaca, chipotle sauce, queso fresco & cilantro.
  * Again, just okay.  At $5 per taco (they are traditonal sized) I expect to be wowwed a bit.

\"Tostada de Lengua\" Cilantro verde, cashew sauce, grilled pineapple radish & beet sprouts.
  *  Get this, it is great.  Everyting in this dish worked together as it should.  No ingredient overpowered another, but all were present.  Great job.

\"Churros\" w/ housemade cajeta ($5)
  * This is where I felt they really robbed me.  Three doughy churros smaller than my little finger in a bowl with sauce too runny to stick to them.  

Overall I would say the food here is pretty average and at $70 for 2 with one drink each you are better off going just about anywhere else.  If you are a fan of the small portions and cool atmosphere try Snackbar.  Its just down Bathurst."}
{"text":"Pros: Good food and drinks
Cons: Extremely loud which makes it impossible to talk to anyone further that 0.5 m away
Overpriced
No indication of the restaurant name outside 

I don't know if I ever decide to come back. Probably not until I learn sign language or they turn their freaking music down"}
{"text":"This place is new and trendy. it seems to cater to a younger crowd. They have interesting drinks, and the people are nice. I haven't actually tried the food, but the menu looks interesting (beef cheek tacos, anyone)?

The one huge negative (and the reason I'm leaving right now) is the constant stream of rap music. One dog-turd song after another. I will never willingly subject myself to rap music,  if I ever have a choice about it. I mentioned this to the server, and he said he didn't have a choice in the matter either."}
{"text":"Good tacos but the service is terrible. Really rushed and not very attentive at all. Very loud place so I wouldn't come here on a date."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's 30th birthday and we had a blast! We had a huge table and service remained prompt and friendly. I didn't actually have much food, but the guacamole was fantastic and the margaritas reaffirmed my recent decision to forego blended bevvies in favour of straight up flavour! Huge props also to the Side Collar, which was the birthday boy's drink of choice. 

I really wanted to try the Crispy Avocado & Frijoles, but didn't have room. My friends raved about the cod tacos, but weren't the biggest fan of the corn even though it looked SO BEAUTIFUL!

If it wasn't for the lighting, this would be an instagramer's paradise. The decor was awesome! I know I keep reviewing places and obsessing over decor, but I can't help it. They had light fixtures that were made out of lightbulbs! And they had tons of neat little areas, neon signs, street style elements, lots of sugar skulls, it was just an awesome place to hang out. Really cool city vibe. 

A few cons: We were seated waaaaay later than our reso and for a while they forgot my guac. It's also not the cheapest, but neither is it the worst prices in Mexicana-Toronto. That's it though! They didn't even screw anything up and for a party  of 18-20, that's impressive. Not a con, but we were there on a Monday and this place was PACKED!

Look for the place with only a sugar skull for a sign and you've found yourself under the sweet solace of La Carnita."}
{"text":"This is your typical hipster taco location with urban vibes. I would give it 5-stars but I was a bit bothered by the hostess. They don't sit you until the whole party gets there, so a friend and I had to wait for 2 other people to get there. Since its small, we waited by the bar. When my friends got there, there weren't any tables left! so we had to sit by the bar and with four people it sucks for socializing.

Then one by one we noticed big groups come in and be seated right away! Instead of telling us, \"hey, we have a table if you want to move to it\" they just forgot us :( 

The food was really good though so it made up for the uncomfortableness of the bar stools. 

The street corn was great and inexpensive, the tacos are small but very flavorful. I ordered the carnita and the beef cheek. The carnita was my favorite out of both."}
{"text":"Our group of eight arrived sporadically, every one of us sporting dark sunglasses to ease our passage through the sunny, chilly, and slightly hungover morning, to partake in La Carnita's Twitter-advertised brunch. The Holy Trinity (coffee, water, tipples) were ordered all around while we poured over the menu. The house drinks were very well presented and prepared, something that I experienced the first time I dined here for dinner. This place has some excellent drinks.

A problem became quickly apparent. We wanted all of it. So we divided up, ordering all 6 tacos between every two people, although our server did warn us that 2 per person were usually enough, considering we sampled the starters as well. But our appetites ignored that sage advice. What follows is a list of the highlights of our gluttonous consumption and some reactions

Cinnamon Bun - The Cajeta frosting makes this tender and tasty bun just that much better. This is not a Cinnabon, it's real, so try to put Louis CK's jokes out of your mind.

Guillijo Granola & Yogurt - This is a great spin on a typically bland bowl of mush. I'm a fan of the mint & hibiscus flower, which lend a different dimension to the mix.

Potato & Yucca Homies - Great hash. Tasty tender beef cheek. Salsa fresca. Egg. This couldn't get any better.

Crispy Chicken Torta - Served on a fresh sesame seed bun. I want to live in this sandwich. I want to move in tomorrow. Get it.

Lamb Bacon & Egg Taco - More traditional than most of the breakfast tacos, but done perfectly.

Chorizo Sausage Taco - MEAT. SPICE. MMM.

Cochinita Pibil Tostada - Everything about this is good. Fried egg on top of braised pork on top of fresh guacamole. Messy, but you'll clean your plate.

We mowed through a couple other tasty tacos, but they didn't elicit the same reactions. That doesn't make them bad, as we were all very very happy at the end of the meal. My only regret is not having room for Churros and Mexican Hot Chocolate. We were all far too full. There's always next weekend..."}
{"text":"\"..La Carnita will do nothing but spice up the offerings in this area, both gastronomically and esthetically. Yes, it appears to have been dubbed hipster central (as so many of the reviews I have read have pointed out, in various ways) but I'm not sure why that is anything other than indicative of fresh appeal. Even from outside the door, one can't help but be impressed. What looks like it will be a great little patio in the summer, leads you through the door into an incredibly well planned room, awash with texture and slick design. Walls that feature art described as 'street' are not only of quality execution and incredibly appealing, but they add so much to the overall experience here....\"

{"text":"Very very overrated. Rude blonde lady who greeted us. I wish I got her name. Horrible seating set up, we were stuck near the very front doors, where the door kept opening and kept the front area cold. We had nosy people sitting beside us listening every once in a while to our conversation - wonderful! they need to either make their music louder or spread out the tables at the front.

Now onto the food. For the ratings this place has, the food definitely did NOT match! The carne asade taco was a 3/5, the cod taco was 1/5 (very very tangy and sour), my friend did not like her chicken taco either. I had such HIGH hopes for this place, but was let down horribly. The tacos on the appetizer menu at Jack Astor's taste WAAAAAAAY BETTER!

Never ever recommending this place to anyone or coming back."}
{"text":"Seven lives was my go-to place for tacos but it looks like it's going to change. 

Got seats in the patio Sunday afternoon with my boyfriend. Service was quite attentive. Food was so so good. 

Tacos were about $5 to $8. Kind of like Seven Lives. 

In my opinion, I like the saucey, messy tacos. I got the 3 tacos: cod, pork belly, and another fish (I think). 

All three had beautiful servings of avocado and a good share of the meat. That's what I loooooove about tacos; that you can fit all the good stuff in a tiny tortilla. (Maybe it could of been a bit bigger to be more filling, but I feel that it's the same amount of food as Seven Lives and same price except there's actually a place to sit here.) 

Avocado + Mango Salad (9):
So unique! This dish was filling with lots of avocado, a type of Spanish white cheese, dried plantains, and jicama. It was crunchy and savoury but I totally didn't feel guilty for eating it. 

The patio is right out John street, very roomy with several benches. Give you a perfect view of the line of for Sweet Jesus that day. 

Overall would come again and am so happy they opened another location on Queen East (woot leslieville!)"}
{"text":"This place has great Tacos. The cod are, in my opinion, the best anywhere. The atmosphere is fun, albeit sometimes a bit too loud. The prices are slightly higher than Grand Electric, but it isn't a huge difference. The desserts are amazing too. This is always my go-to place for a meal out."}
{"text":"Surly server, terrible veg taco (I mean really... terrible. cold tortilla from a package, unappetizing beans like canned, red sauce like the taco sauce in a bottle at the grocery store (no seriously... exactly like, I get it frequently) and what even was the lukewarm fried thing? the only veg option. corn was good, nothing to write home about. 

when asked, I indicated to the server that I didn't much care for it - she didn't acknowledge the dissatisfaction and only returned for the bill.

not sure why this place gets rave reviews?"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, good portion sizes, and unique daily specials...taste and quality are comparable to Grand Electric, but pricier. Service was excellent, with more than one waiter/waitress always available. No wait at 6PM on a Wednesday, so try to arrive early to avoid lines. Tres leches cake is a must-try for dessert, and churros are decent too. Overall, a better atmosphere than Grand Electric (where you may have to share a table with strangers), but not as good value for money."}
{"text":"I have to say I was quite impressed with the service given how busy it was. It was a Friday night and packed. We expected it would be a while for our dishes to be served, but nope! The only thing that took a while were the churros for dessert, and I am pretty sure it was because the waitress forgot to put the order in. Fair mistake.

On that note, the churros weren't so great. They were $5 for three. They were small and tough, as if they stale or unfresh. On the other hand, the guacamole served with the chips were was quite good, and everyone was pretty impressed with the tacos. Each taco is about $5 and you might be satisfied after 3. The cocktails are unique, strong, and tasty, so at $10 I think they are worth it."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and it never disappoints. 

We always get the 'In Cod we Trust' and the carne taco. Guacamole and chips is good is good to start. The street corn is awesome - I would highly recommend it.  The  vegetarian taco options are also good. Overall, you don't go wrong!"}
{"text":"So... Sunday some friends and I came here for an early dinner around 6Pm. Let me break this down as simple as possible.

1. party of 5 (us) seated right away.
2. We ordered Sangrias (they were whatever, tasted like fruit juice.)
3. Our server automatically assumed that we have been there already in the past assuming we knew what the deal was....ummmm ok?
4. We ordered our food it came fairly quickly.
5. Our food came all mismatched on their round metal trays lined with paper that seats 3 tacos. 
6. ****Red flag***** hold up. what the fuck do you mean you took our orders individually and serve them to us like a share plate? And then tell us as you're serving us \" Oh by the way they will be coming out in this manner, mismatched so find your food whoever ordered this and that.\"
7. If you guys serve your food all mismatched and peoples orders are being mixed up in the servings then why didn't you A. tell us that in the beginning and B. Take the order down on one sheet of paper as ONE individual order.
8. This especially pisses me off because of the fact that my girlfriends best friend is allergic to fish and both items i ordered were FISH items. 
9. my FISH taco and my girlfriends best friends tacos were both served on the same plate, so here we are looking at 3 tacos and 1 is a mushroom taco and one is a fish taco and the other is a cauliflower taco. Both the fish and cauliflower Taco had a fried piece of meat/vegetable under a bunch of toppings, and the one the server described as fish ended up being the cauliflower one when he had presented our plate to us.
10. Are we supposed to dissect our food and see which is which? no, it took my girlfriends best friend two bites into her food to realize she had been eating fish. 
11. My friend brought up the issue to our female server and automatically she got defensive and stated that \"we should've told her about food allergies if we were concerned about how our food was going to be served and of any mixups\".

Conclusion of this place ... The food was bland. In no way a representation of what Mexican food should taste like. Slightly Overpriced, Over crowded with seats and awkward seating positions that give people a hard time getting around to go to the bathroom or leaving after the meal. I will DEFINITELY not be returning and Will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I would rate the food a 3, however what upsets me and brings down the rating are the prices and popularity of this place.  It's expensive, and considering the portions and quality of the food, it's a rip off.  There are so many better Mexican places in the city that deserve your money, this isn't one of them.

I feel like the focus is on making the food look pretty and Instagrammable, at the expense of taste. I'm not even asking for authentic food, just make it taste good!

The positive: central location and cute, hipster interior."}
{"text":"Always a great experience at la carnita! the fish tacos are heavenly, the service is fast but friendly and welcoming so can't complain about that.

Overall Very pleased with their restaurant :)"}
{"text":"We dropped in on a late Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. We liked the separate areas for eating,drinking or both. The staff was so so friendly and helpful!!! We tried the soup, guacamole and chips. I could eat a huge bowl of the pulled pork and black bean soup. Then I would combine it with the guacamole and chip!! Oh I did that. The tacos were very flavorful and had just the right textures. We loved all of them. Thank you La Carnita for a great meal ."}
{"text":"We ordered scallop ceviche, cod, rockfish, and beef cheek tacos. Tacos and ceviche were delicious. But Seven Lives is better in terms of flavour, price and satisfaction overall. 
Also, the atmosphere was a little bit loud due to the bass intensive gangster rap emanating from the speakers."}
{"text":"first off, let me say that the food was excellent and the service acceptable. It would have been a solid 4/4.5 star restaurant.  The first star is lost for the shit, loud, music and ambiance: a forced, mediocre attempt at Mexican cantina (read: fake dive bar).

Let's talk drinks.

Never in my life have I been so accosted by such a miserable excuse for a Margarita.  An affront to both the slushy-machine-in-a-resort-tourist-bar and classic, nuanced, cocktail alike.  Considering that they have all the ingredients and present themselves as a cocktail bar, one would assume that the quintessential tequila cocktail would be king in a Mexican restaurant, such is not the case.  Pre-made with lime bar mix, pitiful quantities of tequila, aboslutely zero triple sec.  To be clear:  It. Comes. Ready-made. From. A. Beer. Tap.  

Sort your shit out."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The ambiance is young & fresh. Service was fast & efficient. Tacos come in portions of 1. We had their tortilla chips with 3 dips to start (beans, guac & sweet corn/tomato). We tried their cod, chorizo, tuna, chicken & beef. All were delicious without a single complaint. 

I heard their corn cobs & churros are great too, but we skipped on those. 

Will definitely visit this place again."}
{"text":"Make sure you make a reservation.The tacos are pretty good. Great, quick service, one plate followed the other. Every taco was flavourful in its own way. Only comment would be that I found the portions a tad bit small, but I guess it's meant to be a quick bite spot. Ambience was lovely, both the surrounding music & crowd."}
{"text":"Usually a line-up for a table makes me go somewhere else, but my friend really loves this place so we left our names and grabbed a drink down the street.

They texted, we grabbed a table upstairs, and everything was perfect. The playlist was strictly Drake songs, which I didn't mind -- the timing was right. We got served right away and grabbed some Detour -- they have it on tap!

Started with some meatballs (a little expensive) that were incredible. The sauce was nice and sweet, like sugary molasses. We also got some avocado/mango salad which was also really good.

On to the tacos! The crispy chicken thigh was probably my favourite, but there was a duck special that came a super-close 2nd place. If you see it on the specials I would definitely grab an order.

I like the vibe of the place a lot. Both the food and service was excellent. I can imagine the line-ups get pretty hectic (along with the chaos of also running Sweet Jesus) but it's well worth the wait. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This was a great place for lunch. The service was a bit slow but the food was delicious and very typical. Price, food and the environment were great. I would certainly come back as soon as I have the opportunity."}
{"text":"One of many of these style of Mexican restaurants that have popped up in Toronto.  For the most part I like the concept of Mexican tapas where you order individual tacos and accompaniments.  The tacos here are packed with flavour.  The mexican corn is amazing - but beware it's really spicy!  Prices aren't too bad and service is phenomenal.  

Maybe I'm just getting old, but does the music have to be SO loud?  I don't mind music being played, but it would be nice not to have to scream at the person sitting next to me.  It's unfortunately b/c this is a great place for a date, girls night or a gathering of friends that you want to share good food and good tequila with."}
{"text":"Been to this location twice as of this review.. both times on a Saturday night. It's bigger than the College St. location, but just as crowded and loud.

When you walk in, don't expect to get a table right away.. you'll have to wait. Both times, we waited less than 10 minutes (for a table for 2 and 3), so it wasn't bad.  The location is connected to Sweet Jesus so you don't have to venture back out for ice cream.

In terms of food quality, I didn't find much of a difference between locations. The downside is how loud the place is -- it sort of ruins the dining experience because you have to shout your conversation."}
{"text":"I've been here twice (once in May 2014 and more recently on November 3rd 2017) and the John St. location a few times.

The first time I went to this location was back when La Carnita only had one location on College Street.  And it was LOUD.  I couldn't really have any conversations with my friends because it was so packed and the music was loud -- basically had to shout the conversations even though my friends sat pretty close.

I'm guessing that, due to expansions, the College Street location isn't as packed as it was back when they first started out.  Came here on a Friday night close to 6:00pm after catching a movie in the afternoon and it was about 60% full.  Waitresses and waiters were attentive and the food came out pretty quickly, so it was good.  The restaurant did progressively get more busy as the night went on, but I think my friend and I arrived just before the dinner rush.

Ordered a lot of classic tacos and I ended up getting churros for dessert.  Food is just as good as the John St. location and the same as I remember, so I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Today, in the middle of my yoga class, I spontaneously announced \"man, I could really use a taco right about now\". Sure, it was lunchtime, but I think the real reason behind my craving was that the last tacos I had were at La Carnita, and the La Carnita experience was wholly unsatisfying. 

My friends and I are pretty loyal to Grand Electric, so we had high hopes for La Carnita. I arrived early, waited about 45 minutes for a table for 5. Got started with a margarita. It was half the size of a GE margarita, not as good  (they put the salt right in the margarita - I hate that), and $2 more expensive. This began the trend for the evening. Guac was lovely, but we thought the portion was smaller than GE's equally good guac. Tacos were slightly larger, but just nowhere near as good as GE, and again, more expensive. Honestly, we just felt that they were bland, and not that special. They looked beautiful, but they didn't taste like much. We ordered every taco on the menu, but not a one stood out enough to be called by name. It wasn't an experience, it was food. 

The key lime pie on a stick thing was just ok. We got 2 for 5 people, and we didn't even fight over them. The one thing we did really like was the WhoShotYa? cocktail: Bulleit bourbon + House-made hibiscus grenadine + Ginger syrup + Lemon juice + Grapefruit rind + Ice + An Old-Fashioned glass. Yum. Boozy deliciousness.

After all was said and done, we discussed our disappointment, and came to the consensus that La Carnita is a College Street version of Grand Electric. Let me be clear - there may not be anything wrong with that!! I'm sure there are lots of people that will llloooovvveee a College Street version of GE. But for us, it lacked the authenticity, the flair, the POP of GE - that energy that makes GE so fun, in addition to GE having amazing tacos and drinks. It was alright, the food was ok, but it was just more generic, more expensive, and less original. The decor is just whatever. It's all just sort of whatever. 

I won't be running back to La Carnita, but I'll be happy that the lineup is bound to be shorter now at Grand Electric. Have fun!"}
{"text":"A true 3 star. I've always wanted to try la carnita since it was on college street. But, i was skeptical about trying when i read some reviews on yelp. What stood out in the reviews were  the small portion sizes relative to cost. I was expecting a 2 star place, but to my surprise, this is a true 3!

There's two levels for dining. We went to the second floor and saw that they can accommodate large groups. The decor was rustic and music was hip hop, which I really liked. Very comparable to their sister company, home of the brave.

Waitress was a bit cold and unapproachable in my opinion, but she did her job. Service is very slow. It took about 15 mins to get our appetizers and 15 minutes to get our dessert. The waitress had to go check on the order because it was so slow. It was pretty busy though, but servers came quickly to clear our table. 

We ordered:

The Sunday rib special ($15) - 6 pieces of fall off the bone ribs. Pretty spicy for me ( I don't do spicy at all), but full of flavour with some crispy little bits. Grade: A

Corn ($9) - my fave. Got it based on yelpers recommendation and I wasn't disappointed. Very flavourful. Loved the sour cream and spices. By far my fave - grade: A

In cod we trust ($4.95 per taco) - my fave taco. Cod was freshly fried, sauce and flavour was good. Reminds me of grand electric's fish tacos. Grade: A

Carnita ($4.95 per taco) - not good. Tasteless, and the meat was very liquidity. Grade: C

Tostada de ceviche ($6.50) - disappointing. The shell was good. Deep fried, but the Ceviche had no taste and was very watery. There was a touch of coconut pieces, which gave it a nice sweet contrast flavour, but there wasn't enough. Should add more to it. They didn't skim on the tuna pieces. They were chunky, but unfortunately, it had no flavour. Grade: C

Dessert: key lime Popsicle from sweet Jesus ($4). I really loved this Popsicle. In fact, I like it more than the soft serve at sweet Jesus. It's not your typical Popsicle. It had a lot of flavour with little pieces of lime inside the Popsicle. My tip, skip the line at sweet Jesus and come to la carnita for the Popsicle! Grade: A+

The portions is on par with other taco places. They are very generous with the stuffing/ingredients in my opinion compared to Wilbur. 

Price is about $1 more than grand electric and Wilbur, but isn't bad. Competitive to be honest in my opinion. For 2 people, without drinks, we spent about $67 including tax and tip. 

Overall, I would come here again for Popsicle, corn, and to try their other tacos."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with coworkers. We were a big group so went in around 11:30 am. The restaurant is quite spacious. They have benches instead of chairs and the place has a very hipster feel. 

Service was quite attentive and we got a plate of Tortilla chips. The chips were well seasoned with ancho chilli powder and were quite fresh. We got all three dips - guacamole, queso dip and corn salsa. The dips were all delicious. I really enjoyed this appetizer. I ordered two tacos; the cod and carnita. The tacos had generous toppings. So it was a bit difficult to eat without them falling apart. The fish taco had a good tangy sauce but I the fried cod was kind of disappointing. The carnita wasn't any more memorable. The tacos were quite filling. One of my friends ordered an empanada and it was quite well presented.

This is a decent option especially for a large group. Don't come here if you are looking for authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"Seriously, this place is another overhyped hipster to-be-seen place. I thought it was so cool with its loud rap music, street food/fusion type concept and I was so enticed.  Maybe it was because I had high expectations because there are such similar taco concepts in Miami/LA and I was looking for that fix I once had.

But oh gosh, major disappointment - mini mini tacos for $4.75 a pop, the accent of pickled red onions ON EVERYTHING is nothing to write home about and we had a sizable share of the menu - chorizo, pork and cod tacos. I was not impressed. I'd rather have had my $50 bill and eaten through all of the Mexican food (churros included) at Kensington."}
{"text":"The best tacos I've ever had! 

I don't know what else to say, but it's hands down the best tacos. The cabbage on the tacos makes everything so refreshing and the meat... Yum! 

I got the fish, battered chicken and beef cheek. My fave of all three is the beef cheek. They're still all good, I just prefer the beef cheek. We ended the meal with churros. Another best I've ever had. 

The place itself is beautiful. It's well designed. I just didn't like the noisy atmosphere. It was so loud. Still, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious !!! My fav are the fish tacos & Mexican sodas! My children love their churros !"}
{"text":"Great food but the service was awful. The waiter was really rude, and seemed to really be rushing is to finish our meal even after the food had just arrived. Although the tacos are good, I say it's not worth the long line or bad service."}
{"text":"I don't understand the lack of 5 star reviews for La Carnita, clearly these people have not tried the Mexican street corn because it's absolutely incredible! We came on Saturday afternoon and after waiting for roughly 15 minutes for a table, we were seated. After indulging in the greatness that was the Mexican street corn, I ate my delicious Pollo Frito taco. The Pollo Frito taco is a fried chicken taco with Peanut sauce, cabbage, and a few other things I'm drawing a blank on. Overall, this place has an awesome atmosphere, good service, and a great menu. I will most certainly be coming back here in the future (mostly to eat more of the street corn)."}
{"text":"Came in at 2:30pm on a Sunday. Service was terrible. Door was meh. Tacos weren't hot. Corn had okay flavoring. I got the chorizo and carne asada tacos, both has excess liquids and not enough flavoring. I came solo, and sat at the bar."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner. The food was pretty good and authentic (reminiscent of the food I had while in Guadalajara). I was initially super excited about the cod taco but was slightly let down -- a little too sour with a bit too much batter for my tastes. Most of the food on the menu is SPICY, which I totally forgot about when ordering (my bad!). So a lot of the food was too spicy for my low level of spice tolerance. That being said, when I let our waiter know, she was able to take it back to the kitchen and give us milder versions.

The atmosphere was also pretty good -- very relaxed, casual atmosphere. Our waiter wasn't exactly popping with personality but she was efficient and got the job done. The one thing I wasn't such a fan of was how dark the restaurant was. Also, if you're looking for a quiet place to eat and chat with friends, this place probably isn't it.

Overall, a pretty good place to get some Mexican food."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've had so much fun both times I've eaten here!

Great atmosphere, great service (both bar and table) amazing food. 

Bookend your meal with the street corn (to start) and the churros (to finish). Best I've tried. 

Margarita pitchers do not disappoint. 

NOTE: it takes awhile to get a table. So get cozy at the bar and have some guacamole and chips and chat with your friends and don't worry about it."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant and the best tacos I've had in Toronto!

Tacos range from $5-10, which can be seen as pricey, but the tacos are generously filled. My personal favourite is the Pollo Frito, which is crispy chicken thigh with peanut mole, honey, hot sauce, cabbage, and salsa--the perfect amount of savoury and sweet!

As for starters and sides, I highly recommend the Chips with Dip, which come with their homemade perfectly spiced chips and your choice of guacamole, corn salsa, and/or spicy bean dip. The Avocado Mango Salad is delicious and can add a much needed light touch to your meal. If you like spice, I would recommend the Scorpion Wings as well! As for dessert, the churros were perfectly doughy on the inside and the caramel dip wasn't too sweet or overwhelming!

I typically like to try a mix of old and new items off the menu every time I go, and I've never left without my tastebuds wanting more!

If you choose to go for lunch, they have their lunch prix fixe $16.99 for a starter, 2 tacos, and dessert. Definitely a steal, if your stomach can handle that much food!

As for the atmosphere, it is, for lack of a better word, hip. Servers are dressed casually and music is (very) loud. It can get busy, especially around dinner time, so I recommend making a reservation. Service can be slow at times, but I am willing to compromise for such delicious food!"}
{"text":"It was alright. The tacos themselves were tiny, but good, but not amazing. And for $5+ per tiny taco, I want them to be pretty amazing. It's also incredibly loud, so as others have said if you don't want to be able to hear the person you're with, this is a great place. I also found our waitress kind of rude. She took forever to come back to take our order, and when I asked if I could get mine without beans she angrily said \"we don't modify our tacos\". I asked if they were pre made and instead of answering she just repeated \"we don't modify our tacos.\" Too cool to give the customers what they want, I guess. I get wanting to keep the chef's ideas intact, but at the cost of losing customers? That attitude alone, of the waitress and the restaurant is reason enough for me not to return."}
{"text":"6 dollars for a taco?!? I had the cod and fried chicken taco and neither were very good. Guac and grilled corn were pretty good but it's hard to screw that up. This place is definitely over-hyped."}
{"text":"What we ordered: 2 tecate, 3 dips and chips, 3 voltron cod, 1 asada, 1 cotija.

La Carnita is always consistent with their food, and it's ALWAYS a great time. I've dined here with a date, with big groups, and even alone. Their service can be slow especially when they get busy, but the friendliness of their staff make up for it. As for their food, I like to start off with the 3 dips and chips or the corn (or both). The chips and dips can be filling, but it's hard to pass on it whenever I dine here. I've had almost all of their tacos, and I think it's safe to say that their cod is my favourite and the best fish tacos I've had yet. I'll probably come back for dinner next week. Highly recommend resos for dinner when you're a group of 3+."}
{"text":"Seating is not hard if you arrive closer to 6pm it seems. We had a party of 6 people and were seated right away. It filled up really fast by 7! It is quite loud and I left the restaurant with a sore throat. 

The nachos three way dip was a good way to start. The chips reminded me of deep fried thin wanton dough/wrap. lol You can ask for more chips when you run out. I am not a huge fan of tacos, but this place is exceptional. Love the personal taco servings. My favourites are beef cheek and In Cod We Trust. 

Tried churro with chocolate dip. Unfortunately, the churro was very small in diameter, and tasted like it was deep fried again and again. It was hard and oily, not much taste or any of the chewiness I expected from the dough beneath a crispy exterior. 

Would definitely go back again for dinner, but go elsewhere for desserts."}
{"text":"Food's great, as expected.
Music, way too loud.  Turn it down.
Service was a mix bag.  I found some staff unprofessional and distracting."}
{"text":"I really like the food at the College location; however, my experience at Yonge & Eg was one of my worst restaurant experiences in Toronto, hands-down.

I arrived for a reservation and ordered a drink.  Shortly thereafter, my dining companion notified me that she was stuck in traffic and would meet me at our later commitment.  It took me a frustratingly long time to get the server's attention, explain the situation, and ask if I could be served at the bar instead of taking up a table.  This was the first sign of things to come.

I moved to the bar, where the bartender approached and asked if I'd ordered food. I asked to see the menu, which he gave me.

And...nothing.  For the next 25 minutes, I was not approached.  The bartender, when he appeared, stayed at the other end of the (very long) bar and studiously ignored my attempts to flag him down.  My drink went dry, and I never got to order food.  I couldn't even get anyone's attention to tell them that I was giving up - I ended up tossing $15 on the counter for my $9.50 bottle of beer, and leaving.

I'm not sure if they just did not have enough staff to handle the volume at the restaurant (it was only half full) or if, and this seems more likely, a lone woman sitting at the bar was not deemed worthy of being paid attention.  

I eat at the bar alone A LOT in this city, and I expect to be respected as a solo diner.  For shame, La Carnita.

My story has a happy ending, though - I walked down to the Prohibition Gastrohouse, where, seated at the bar, I received amazing and attentive service from a number of staff people, alongside good food!"}
{"text":"Went out for dinner last night. What a disappointing end to a fairly decent experience. 

A friend and I decided on this resto for dinner (her recommendation). 
At first I was surprised at how noisy it was. You literally need to lean in and shout across the table just to be heard. It wasn't just the noise of others talking, but the servers were literally throwing dirty plates etc into bins (I have no idea how those plates weren't breaking) and they were dropping and breaking things and laughing, very unprofessional that this is all happening directly beside us!
Other than the noise and unprofessional behaviour, it was a nice looking venue. 

Food: was good. Not great. Was plated nicely. 

Service: it appears that they DO NOT train their servers. Although my server was very friendly, she appeared untrained. I did ask for suggestions and she made some. Then we were literally debating what we wanted to order next and my server drops the bills on the table and smiles and walks away? When she walks by our table again I asked if they are closing for the night. She says no. So I let her know that I am enquiring because we didn't ask for our bill and she just gave it to us, and decided to decided it in 2. She said she was leaving for the night. Stunned we told her that we didn't need divided bills so she grabs it off the table, returns and throws the bill down without saying a word and storms off. 
I've never been more confused. Then when we paid in cash, she asked if we needed change. We said yes. She never returned with the change, we left. 

Too bad, this place has potential."}
{"text":"Loud music + delicious food. Finally tried La Carnita last week and we sat at the window to avoid the 45 min wait. The first time I came around, I was ignored by the server who didn't even take my name down; luckily this time service was better. 

Started with the Mexican Corn - already salivating from the smell of the chili powder. Love the cream sauce and chili powder on top of the sweet corn.. really good, I could even use more sauce!

Started off with 4 tacos to share: 
In Cod We Trust - first off, I love the tacos. They are sooo soft and thin. The fish was very large piece, crispy fried and soft inside. Liked the crisp red cabbage and apple on top. Spicy sauce. 

Beef Cheek - ate a whole one myself! good combination of the soft beef, creamy avocado and spicy jalepeno makes this one of the more mild, mellow tacos.

Carnita - I didn't think I liked mango salsa until I had this. It is just so fresh and sweet, really makes the taco flavors stand out! 

Special of the day - crab cake on tostada. I love the crispy tostada! Didnt really like the crab cake though, a bit mushy for me and couldn't taste crab. 

Then we decided might as well try the rest of the menu!

Pollo frito - I was hesitant to order this 'cause fried chicken sounds so plain and less popular, but it was the best of the night! The chicken was so well done - perfect crisp bite size pieces, moist inside. Also worried the peanut mole would be heavy, but overall the combination of hot sauce with just a touch of peanut was amazing. Topped off with fresh tomato salsa, it was just a wonderful combination of such different flavors that worked so well together. 

Tostada de Ceviche - just loved the tostada so much had to order another one. This one is more of the fresh, Mexican flavor with the creamy guacomole, tomato and cucumber. Couldn't taste much fish (tiny bits) or coconut milk though, but still enjoyed it. 

Was stuffed at this point but had to order dessert: 

Churros - Crispy with the best cajeta.. I just ate the churro to eat the cajeta.. smooth delicious caramel. 

Key Lime Paleta - super cute little popsicle. Lime flavor is just right (not too overpowering or sour), topped with graham cracker crumbs (a bit too much on that though)

Overall, a great delicious dinner!!  Fav is the Pollo Frito, but really, everything was good."}
{"text":"I was at La Carnita this past weekend. The food was amazing! had the fish (cod), and steak tacos, and the nachos with all three dips. Everything was amazing. SOO delicious. Yes the fish tacos are as good as everyone says - I would def recommend them. The guacamole was REALLY yummy! They also dust the tortilla chips with some spicy taco mix so they can get a bit spicy for some, however my whole table really enjoyed them. 
The place gets really packed and there didn't seem to be enough servers to go around, so service was not fantastic, but the actual waiter was very very nice and friendly. It also gets really loud in here which makes it hard to hear people near you - but aside from those two, I'd say this place is pretty great! Looking forward to becoming a regular here!"}
{"text":"I came here soon after it opened on a non-busy night and was seated right away. This gave La Carnita one point in its favour over Grand Electric, its most obvious competitor. In terms of the food, it was very good but slighly less flavourful than GE, so it all evened out in the end.

The guacamole and chips and tacos were all delish and worth the raves, but I could have skipped the rather bland tostada. I don't recall the bevvies which can only mean they do not quite measure up to the margaritas at Playa Cabana.

All in all, it's not the best Mexican in the city (Playa Cabana) nor the cheapest (El Trompo) but it hits a nice spot in the middle with a falvourful, short taco menu similar  in price and style to Grand Electric.

(It's really a 3.5)"}
{"text":"Was in the Beaches area for a business trip and was in search of an L.A. type taco joint...  La Carnita didn't disappoint. Nice spot for drinks and tacos! Was there on a Thursday night, great music not too quiet not too loud .. Just right. Beef cheek and carnitas were on point! Don't like that they do give free fountain drink refills or else would of gave them 5 stars."}
{"text":"The grilled elotes were awesome but get ready because it's messy to eat.  Skip the margarita it wasn't anything special for $12 but the sangria was really great.  This place gets packed so make sure you call ahead or you can always grab your dinner at the bar which is first come first serve."}
{"text":"An absolutely fantastic dinner experience. Came here with a larger group (11 in total) and they were very courteous and happy to serve. Staff were very friendly and happy to offer suggestions on what to order.
The street corn to start was very succulent with amazing sauce-highly recommend. The nachos and three dips were also very fresh and tasty, and I had to stop myself from finishing off the entire platter to make room for the tacos.
My taco options were:
-In Cod we trust 
-Carnita (Pork)
-Beef Cheek
-Tuesday special which was calamari.
All of them were AMAZING...with my favourites being the Cod and the Carnita.
The beef tasted a little like corned beef, which would I would have ranked lower in terms of flavour relative to the others, but still one of the best tacos I've ever tasted.
Desserts:
Churros,
Amareo paletta
Tres leche cake.
Nothing but praise for all of them...with the amareo paleta being my top choice. Delicious chocolate ice cream with cherries and a crunchy crumble on the outside...would have ordered two if my belly wasn't telling me to \"STOP EATING\". The cake was also very soft and moist, with a nice berry topping.
Overall, 5/5 on every front and will definitely return. My mouth is watering just as I am writing this review."}
{"text":"Come here every week. Corn, pollo fritto and carne asada. Crave these tacos every week . Since Yelp won't accept my short 5 star review, here is my in-depth look at these tacos. The pollo frito, large piece of freshly fried chicken with an added sweetness along with fresh coleslaw. My favourite taco. The carne asada comes in close second. Tender steak cuts with creamy avocado. La Carnita for life."}
{"text":"Love the restaurant's decor - very unique and trendy. There are booths with a fireplace on the 2nd floor which is great for a bigger party. While the atmosphere was great,  unfortunately can't say quite the same about the food we had. 

Here's the lowdown of what we had:

1) Mexican Street Corn: probably the best thing we ordered. Grilled corn with sour cream and Mexican spices - pretty simple but the combination is fantastic!

2) In Cod We Trust: Wasn't a big fan of this one. The cod was great - cooked to perfection but the combination of the garnish really wasn't for my taste bud. Pickled red cabbage and the green apple were too overpowering IMO.

3) Crispy Cortija: This was okay, bus taste too much like a burrito - the Cortija cheese was almost drowned by the garnish in the tacos - but I still prefer this to the Cod tacos

After this visit, I would only consider coming back if the rest of my party really insist on but I probably would not be coming back if the decision's up to me. Although, I would say that having Sweet Jesus connected to the restaurant is a very smart move on their part!"}
{"text":"I never leave here feeling ripped off or hungry. Solid service with food that speaks of it's nature without being something it's not.

The go to taco for me."}
{"text":"Damn I went ham on those tacos. The corn burned my lips but it was good as usual. The environment was very very chaotic lol but that was the greatest thing about la carnita. Everyone were so loud, we were all having a great time. We didn't order drinks here though. We went to a bar instead. But the food were great! Would definitely visit again. Love, from Chicago."}
{"text":"A popular tacos restaurant that has been popping up in several locations around Toronto along with it's ever popular sidecar business of Sweet Jesus. We walked in on a weekday looking for a late dinner and was greeted by a sparsely lit space with booming rap music. I'm not sure what I expected from a tacos place, but it definitely wasn't darkness and a heavy bass. 

Decor, music and atmosphere aside, the food itself was a hit and miss. The Avocado Mango Salad was fresh and bright, a great accompaniment to the tacos. The Carne Asada taco was delicious, the beef steak was tender and balanced perfectly against the toppings of salsa, avocado and cilantro. The In Cod We Trust taco was really odd, something about the toppings and the fish didn't work for me. Maybe it had too much red cabbage? I didn't like that one. Also, the portions are small for the price. After two tacos I would be normally still be hungry if it wasn't so late at night. 

In all, the experience was okay. The tacos are good but pricey and small."}
{"text":"After so much hype with their little pop-up shops, La Carnita had finally opened their restaurant located at College and Bathurst.  With the funky décor with graffiti and spray-painted walls, La Carnita welcomed us in quickly when we got there around 5:20 - around 6:00 or so, it started to get busy.  The great thing about La Carnita, comparatively speaking to the other new restaurants that I've been to is that there is SPACE, lots of it!

My friend and I started off with the CHILES RELLENOS, basically a stuffed chile with cheese, lime and yogurt.  It was okay, but wasn't the most amazing thing.  I ordered myself the \"IN COD WE TRUST.\" taco along with the \"POLLO FRITO.\"  The cod taco was good, but I found it to be too spicy that it overpowered the rest of the taco.  The pollo frito contained peanut mole sauce, pickled green cabbage, and salsa fresca.  It was not spicy at all, but the fried chicken with the mole sauce was a good combination.   The only vegetarian choice on the menu in regards to tacos was the CRISPY AVOCADO & FRIJOLES (I think) - my friend really enjoyed it.  I wish they had more vegetarian options though. 

We were looking around during the time we were eating, so we ordered more food: the MEXICAN SWEET CORN and the popsicles.  The corn was good, considering the chilli powder gave it some kick, however, $7 was a bit too much for two corn on a cobb.  The popsicles were quite delicious - the PINEAPPLE had some chilli in it, and my friend said it was quite refreshing.  I, myself, had the PALETAS (the key lime pie) - which was quite interesting and quite good as well.

In general, the food was quite good at La Carnita.  I had a few friends that had went quite often.  They did quite a great marketing job - it was quite bumping."}
{"text":"Recommended this place by a friend, and here I came on a Sunday a few weeks ago.  I was ready to have a bit of a wait, but to my surprise, we waited for less than 10 minutes.  Our server was cheerful and very attentive.  The music was kind of loud here, but it's the right decibel level for a bar.  How couldn't we not order beer in this kind of setting?!  Our server helped us pick one light and a dark beer from the list.  I like the light fruity beer. What we had to go with the beer?  First came the crispy chicken torta. This was the Sunday's special. (They have a special each day)  The chicken was crispy and the special spicy sauce was just too good.  Next came the rice and corn frituras.  They were a bit dry tho. The Mexican corn was great. Juicy, sweet and the sauce was delicious. The tacos had generous portion of meat.  The fish was crispy and the meat was juicy. Tacos El Gordo is kind of my benchmark for the best authentic tacos after my trip from Vegas, and this place absolutely has met the benchmark.  Solid five stars for the tacos!"}
{"text":"Do you love clubbing but hate that most don't sell tiny delicious tacos? Than this place is for you. It's also great if you hate the people you're with and don't want to be able to hear them anymore. 

The food itself is great but the portions are tiny so be prepared to order 3-4 to fill you up. My partner has an allergy to avocados but I love the stuff so we asked if we could have one of the tacos with the guac on the side. We were angrily told \"You can have it with guac, or without.\"  Woah, sorry I asked. Touchy subject, I guess.  

Might be back if I ever want to practice my pantomime."}
{"text":"It was recommended by a friend by virtue of the food being top notch.  I can't say i disagree - between the wife and i we tried a few different types of tacos and none of them disappointed.  

We sat at the bar due to there being a wait for a table (we had plans later in the evening that determined our timeline) - bartender was friendly, made some good drink recommendations.

Music seemed a bit louder than it needed to be, but i'm probably 5 years older than their target market.

Good meal, nothing specifically i could call out to improve it, but i feel like La Carnita has been a bit over-hyped.  Three stars seems about right for this place."}
{"text":"Just always so good_ one of few small chains that hasn't been diluted with growth- will be back this week for my taco fix"}
{"text":"@la_carnita #YELPTO #TACO #LCXO #MEXICANFOOD

Where El Caballito excels, La Carnita fails: 

1. Atmosphere --- El Caballito has this super cool vibe, and is hands down the place to be after work. It's full everytime I've been, but you always receive a warm welcome, and you always get seated somewhere nice and cozy in the crowd, yet far from it. La Carnita has this superficial cool vibe on the outside, the hostesses and servers imbibe too-cool-for-school personas and good luck having anyone greet you. Full of \"bourgie\" people and there's little personal space between seating.

2. Tacos --- The tacos are small and fall apart within a bite at La Carnita, and they are not filling either. You're better off ordering $6-$8 tacos at El Caballito.

3. Service --- To get a server is always a painful experience, whether you're in a group or not. They'll usually have 2 very inefficient servers per floor. The food is usually slapped down on the table without any cutlery for the messiness. Ugh, the less I talk about this the better. 

I went to La Carnita in a group recently, although I really just wanted to skip this place for what it is. The group I was with complained that the pitchers were expensive at like $40-$50. That's usually how much I pay for pitchers so it's not something I mind. I didn't have anything to drink in my recent visit but in my past visit, there was little memorable about the drinks."}
{"text":"Like so many other Taco shops, this one seems ear-marked for failure in this upscale neighbourhood. Next to the fast, easy, flexible options, service and huge portions at Chipotle, all others have fallen: Quesada, Chimichanga, etc.. 

Atmosphere: I thought this was going to be a real restaurant, with some free chips and salsa, attentive waitresses and a traditional style menu - not so. Even the menu is printed on a tiny piece of paper. They call this a Taquiera. With nice decor but cafeteria style tables and lack of any staff uniforms or very much staff at all, staff without even a basic uniform, looked indistinguishable from customers and caused a confused, rather than casual atmosphere (and who associates \"casual\" with $12 cocktails?) 

Identity Crisis: The Philthy McNasty's was converted into this restaurant This place was turned into three separate bar/eateries, and his having an identity crisis that's making the food and service suffer. Along with La Carnita, you get Sweet Jesus ice cream shop (where people watched us eating through an inside glass window!?), and the downstairs Good Fortune Bar where they serve a total of Chicken fingers, a burger and pickles (none of which are offered at the taco bar).

Price/ Value: For tacos that cost 4.95 to $7 EACH, cocktails cost $12, cheapest beer is $9, I shouldn't have to eat at a cafeteria/ picnic table with strangers. $70 for 2 people, two tacos each (not tasty) guac and one drink each... not worth it.

Food: My Pollo Frito was nearly inedible. I really should have sent it back. The fried chicken was so dark it was bordering on black-brown, stuffed too full to eat like a normal human and overcooked and spikey (wtf). ($4.95)Since all over tacos arrived on the same plate (although there were two of us, so we had to guess what was what.) The cauliflower one my friend ordered that seemed to have a single deep fried cheese stick in the middle($4.95). The Carnitas (pork) my friend ordered looked like ground pork, not traditional (and delicious pulled pork) and she didn't like it either...($4.95) and the Beef cheek ($5.50) was sooo gamey, the beef was just salt and spice and tasted of overcooked dog-food meat. The Chips and Guac were kinda good, but $8 and the cup of Quac was the size of a side dish you normally get free with nachos at a bar (or for $2.75 at Chipotle). It tasted okay, but we both felt they should have offered salsa or pico di gallo or crema alongside. 

Main issues: 
* Taste: Over-cooked fried chicken that's so dark it's brown-black and almost inedible. Generally unappealing and not traditional flavours.
* size: Tacos had too much filling, and too much water/sauce so they dissolved...making them impossible to eat. They should charge $1 and give you the same amount of filling in TWO shells, that'd be a fair price for a taco that is about 4 inches in diameter!
* Drinks are too expensive and very... ummm mixology-based. No Simple Cape Cods or Sea Breezes here. It's hibiscus grenadine and cucumber syrup and stuff...The drinks are good, but there should be something on offer for under $12, even just a single
* not much value as you get zero side dishes for free (no chips and salsa, no side of rice or beans or salad)
* Menu offers daily tacos you can't get any other day. Seems very limiting.
* Too much seafood, only one vegetarian option and no vegan option and even the guacamole is served with queso fresco on top.

There are better places to spend your money unless they bother changing a LOT, especially making tacos 2/$6 with less filling and having a pulled chicken taco option (didn't even exist) or a grilled chicken. I've never in my LIFE had a fried chicken taco and I've been to Mexico 3 times, and Florida (home of Tex-mex) about 6 times. It's almost offensive they can't do pork or chicken right
 Good luck finding the elusive good Toronto Taco!"}
{"text":"First time at this location. We were stopping by for a snack so we decided to order a few tacos. We got In Cod We Trust, Carne Asada (grilled beef steak), Pollo Frito (Crispy chicken thigh) and Mexican Chorizo. They were all very good and very flavourful. I think our favourite was the beef which we liked the combination of the lime avocado, crispy shallots with a nicely cooked steak. Another one we would re order is thr cod one. Service was good and a nice place for a casual night out."}
{"text":"This is a trendy specialty taco place with cool decor and a great margarita. We came here for dinner with another couple on a Sunday night around 7 and there was no wait. Cool artwork on the walls and a lot of indirect lighting

We had:

Mexican street corn
Chicken Taco
Beef Taco
Carnita Taco
Margaritas

The corn is served as a starter and it's grilled on the cob with some Mexican cheese and spices---I loved the cayenne on the corn it really gave is a nice kick. If you've neverhad Mexican style corn on the cob you should try it! 

The chicken taco was made with breaded/crunchy chicken and was tender on the inside. It was unexpected that it would be crunchy but it was delicious. 

The beef taco was my favorite! The jalapeno made it pretty spicey and I loved it! It was juicy, flavorful, and fresh. It was one of those situations where you feel like you can't eat it fast enough because it tastes so good. I think I blacked out and then the taco was gone.

Margaritas were great too! Usually they are too sweet and taste like margarita mix but this tasted more like a freshly made one and was not very sweet

I am looking forward to coming back here for sure"}
{"text":"I made a dinner reservation for my family and another family. However, once my family and I arrived, I was told 75% of the party had to be there before they can seat anyone, which is rather annoying because Winter is not the season to make your guests stand outside in the cold. After asking to be seated 3 times, they finally seated us and the other family soon arrived after. 

We ordered sangria for drinks which was really good, a bit low on the booze, but good nonetheless. For appetizers, the Mexican Street Corn is absolutely delicious and so is the Avocado Mango Salad - would highly recommend! 

For mains, we had a mixture of the cod, chicken, tuna, and pork tacos. Out of the four, the tuna and the cod were the front runners amongst the group. We expected a lot more from the Pollo Frito, but weren't too impressed with the chicken. 

There is definitely a cool vibe to the place, but it is REALLY loud. Overall, yummy food!"}
{"text":"It can be difficult to identify this place because the restaurant sign isn't very apparent - just look for the skull :)

This place is very dim so for all the foodie instagramers, your pics won't turn out the greatest even with flash. It's also pretty loud so I had a hard time hearing my friend as we were catching up over some tacos. 

I got the beef cheek taco which was really good and the corn to start. Corn was awesome but it has too much sauce for my liking. Taco was delish and decent size portion. Churros were awesome! It had a nice crisp and was fresh as well! It's kinda pricey here but food was good so I would come back again."}
{"text":"The first evening we visited, we were told it would be a 2 hour wait... so we left. The second evening we visited, we were told it would be a 2 hour wait... so we left. Both times, we were told to put our names down on a \"list\" as they didn't take reservations for the evenings we dropped by. But, third time's the charm, right? So the third time we visited, we came on a Thursday evening after work around 7:00 PM. The lineup was still quite long, but the hostess ended up seating us at the two seater front table by the window right away, which had just cleared out. We really, really appreciated the service and effort, and the opportunity to finally try this place! It's boisterous, loud, with a great community atmosphere (read: if you're looking for something quiet and romantic, this isn't it) - overall, a great casual dinner spot. 

First, parking. There was free street parking around the corner, not too far of a walk, so that was a plus.

Second, the food. We ordered: a) the Ghost Face Killah wings ($12.00), b) the Mexican Street Corn ($8.00), c) the Carnita, Beef Cheek, and In Cod We Trust tacos ($4.75 each, or around there), d) Churros (3 pieces, at $6.00), and e) a Mexican soda ($3.00). Out of all of this, I have to say that I absolutely LOVED the Ghost Face wings! Be warned, I believe this is a Thursday special, so if you're there on that day, this is definitely a must try. It's crispy, flavourful, with an almond coconut crumble that gives you all the feels only good food can give you. The tacos were delicious and flavourful, but they aren't the best I've had in the city. Overall, though, it was an absolutely delicious meal. 

For two people, with tax and tip, our total came to $56.22. Well worth it.

If not for the ridiculous wait and inability to book reservations ahead of time, I would have given this place 5 stars. Otherwise, if you happen come by and the wait won't last an eternity, this is a definite must-try spot."}
{"text":"Meh, better tacos at Seven Lives. We ordered the following:

- Cod taco
- Chicken taco
- Beef cheek taco

The Cod was good, but the beef cheek and chicken fell short. The atmosphere was great though - good vibe and quite busy for a Monday evening! Drinks were decent."}
{"text":"I just had my birthday here with about 15 people and I think we all had an amazing time! Specifically I did! 
Firstly, the service. Our waitress was excellent and she did a great job in being very communicative about food being pumped out a little slower than usual. Only having a few lobster tacos left. And just right from the beginning knowing how to make service flow efficiently! 
Secondly, the food was amazing we all had a combo of the wings, corn, chips and quesadilla as apps and from my knowledge they were all amazing. Specifically corn and wings were bombbb. Tacos were amazing. My favourite had to be the lobster. As well, just to warn anyone not used to spicy. Personally, I found everything had a good kick but those who weren't used to spicy struggled a tad. 
I think the only thing I can comment on was the cake situation. So while we brought a cake my boyfriend called ahead of time and asked if that was fine and no one informed him of a 2 dollar charge per person on the cake slicing. If he had known that ahead of time he probably would've purchased the cake from them so communication would've been better on that part."}
{"text":"We have been here on multiple occasions and have always had their feature of the day and have never been disappointed with anything we've ordered.  It's always packed, a bar and some smaller tables in the front and larger long tables in the back.  We have had the wings, which were delicious, and the nachos as well (freshly made).  All of the tacos are delicious, my favorites were the Crispy cotija cheese and cauliflower tacos with pickled carrots.  A savory and crispy taco offset with a sharp contrast of pickle and creamy sauce.  Also the In Cod We Trust, again savory offset with acidity, sweet apple and spicy creamy sauce.  If I wasn't waiting for my car to be fixed, I would be heading here now."}
{"text":"For some reason, I had it in my mind that in the taco battle between Grand Electric and La Carnita, the former was just slightly superior to the latter. A recent trip to La Carnita has me convinced the race is much closer than I thought.

So I started out with an order of three tacos: In Cod We Trust (Cod, Voltron sauce, lime crema, pickled red cabbage, green apple & cilantro), Pollo Frito (Crispy chicken thigh, peanut mole,honey, Rossy's hot sauce, green cabbage & salsa fresca), and Beef Cheek (Ancho braised cheek, lime avocado, green cabbage, pickled jalapeño & crispy shallots, queso anejo, charred pepper sauce).

My favorite was the Beef Cheek; the meat itself was juicy and flavorful, while the various toppings complemented it perfectly. Honestly I could've easily eaten a dozen of these in a row. The Pollo Frito was also amazing, although the chicken itself was a little tough in places. In Cod We Trust was my least favorite, primarily because the green apple gave the whole thing a tartness that felt out of place. (The fish itself was piping hot and delicious, though.)

I hadn't meant to order anything else, but I was still hungry so I also got the Carnita (Confit pork, jalapeño sauce, mango salsa, queso añejo, guacamole, chicharron, cilantro). The pork was a little dry, admittedly, but the toppings were perfect.

Aside from a few flaws here and there, I wholeheartedly enjoyed my meal at La Carnita and will certainly be returning to try more things (and to eat the Beef Cheek again!)"}
{"text":"Through a weird coincidence, I wound up eating here twice in the span of a few days, so I did get a chance to try most of the tacos on the menu.

The first time I came we started with the Tortilla Chips with ancho chili powder and guacamole. These house-made chips are pretty phenomenal, to be honest. The dusting of ancho chili powder ensures that they're delicious all on their own, while the guac is spicy and flavorful. (The second time I came I started with the Mission Salad, which inexplicably isn't listed on the website, so I can't describe what's in it. Nevertheless it's extremely tasty and quite addictive.)

So I've tried the following tacos:

In Cod We Trust (\"Cod, Voltron sauce, lime crema, pickled red cabbage, green apple & cilantro\"): Probably my favorite taco on offer. The generous piece of fried fish was cooked perfectly, while the accompanying toppings proved an ideal complement.

Pollo Fritto (\"Crispy chicken thigh, peanut mole,honey, Rossy's hot sauce, green cabbage & salsa fresca\"): Okay, wait. Maybe *this* was my favorite. The big chunks of chicken were unbelievably tasty and I loved the level of spice the taco contained. I could seriously eat this every day.

Beef Cheek (\"Ancho braised cheek, lime avocado, green cabbage, pickled jalapeño & crispy shallots, queso anejo, charred pepper sauce\"): Again, a complete and total winner. The meat is soft and juicy, and the toppings are placed ever-so-carefully and are a perfect accompaniment.

Carnita (\"Confit pork, jalapeño sauce, mango salsa, queso añejo, guacamole, chicharron, cilantro\"): Though this was my least favorite, it's still miles better than most tacos out there. It's just bursting with flavor, but somehow it's not as memorable as the aforementioned tacos.

I also sampled the Churros (\"w/ housemade cajeta\") and my god are they delicious. The churros themselves are crispy but also soft inside, while the caramel sauce is amazingly sweet and rich. (I'm not ashamed to admit I drank what was left after the churro was gone.)

And this is all the tip of the iceberg in terms of La Carnita's menu. I'm certainly looking forward to trying more of their stuff."}
{"text":"its just okay, the taco's aren't the best, the corn is good (spicy). The day we went it was really loud so it was hard to have a conversation. 
Service was alright, and the food came quickly. 
I wouldn't think I would go back.."}
{"text":"Food, not authentic at all. The cod taco was ok, however, the apple garniture just does not go with mexican food. Carnitas taco was garnished with mango, which does not mix very well. Overall, bland. 

Music was just the same as most hipster places in Toronto, hip hop, which after a while gets annoying. 

Service was below average and the selection of beer was not the best."}
{"text":"For a young crowd, simply the best. Loud music, strong drinks, and amazing food. If you want a quiet and romantic night, La Carnita is not the place to be. Be sure to get there early if you want a spot."}
{"text":"I have a real soft spot for all things Mexican so wasn't I just tickled pink when I heard the elusive taco truck was putting down permanent roots on College Street.  The place was bustling at 6:30 on a Wednesday and my companion and I grabbed a window seat and surveyed the menu.

First thing's first.  On that sweltering day margaritas were in order.  No fancy salt rimmed glasses here.  Just a short glass with lots of ice, tequila and lime.

I know some of the reviews on here have been kind of \"meh\", but our dinner was delicious all around.  We tried the in Cod we Trust, the Pollo Frito, Crispy Avocado & Frijoles and the Tostada de Lengua (which I didn't realize was beef tongue when I ordered it, but it was ridiculous.... so good).  Everything was fresh, well balanced and beautifully but simply presented.  Staff were friendly, and quick.

To top it off our bill was served with a limited edition print!

Watch out, I'll be the Yelp Dutchess of this place yet!"}
{"text":"Truly disappointing. Stopped here with my husband to have a bite to eat and a beer or two. Well, usually a \"bite to eat\" is just a figure of speech...but no, these tacos are literally bite size - with hefty price tags. The waitress talked us into the \"chef's special\" which was a pork belly taco, and while they were mildly tasty, they were $7.50 each and about the size of a drink coaster (a little ploop of meat in the middle). Took one, maybe two bites to be finished. We ordered one each, and we also ordered two beers. After deciding that the portions were a total rip off, we asked for the bill and ended up spending $41, after tip, on 2 measly tacos and 2 beers. Pissed and hungry, we wandered down the street for 2 minutes and happened upon Kinton Ramen, which was incredible and we spent $30 on two amazing bowls of ramen. Highly highly highly recommend skipping this joint and heading to Kinton. The service and food was wonderful at Kinton, and they have some sense of respect for your hard earned money."}
{"text":"The tacos were delicious and the mango salad is a must have. Great atmosphere, lots of trap music."}
{"text":"Go across the street to Hacienda Las Américas if you want authentic Mexican and amazingly priced and portioned food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco place in Toronto, if your going to splurge this is definitely the place to do it. Always good music and service, food comes quick and is delicious every time I go! (Which is often) It's 100% my go too and what I recommend when friends and family are visiting. If you want to go when it's not so loud and busy I would recommend lunch or early dinner there usually isn't a line and the music isn't as bumpin! 5"}
{"text":"Lo-lo-love La-La-La Carnita!

This little gem is (of course) right around College & Bathurst. But even with a lot of similar cuisine in the area this place is definitely a standout!

The corn is simply amazing. Charred & served with some crema & ancho peppers - it sounds simple but trust me, worth a try!

The tacos are about 4.50 a pop, and while small, they are packed full of delicious and fresh ingredients. I want to come back here and try Every. Single. One. Mmm mm! Rave reviews all around the table for these bad boys!

The Tres Leche Cake isn't a traditional tres leche, but it's still quite yummy! Super moist cake and nice & runny deliciousness from the condensed milk. 3 of them came to our table and were devoured within a matter of minutes. 

I had: half an app, a taco, a dessert, and a margarita for just over $30 including taxes and tip and I was super satisfied. 

My only complaint about this place is they definitely try to rush you out of there as fast as you can. There is a 2 hour table limit but we were rushed much faster than that. Not the type of place to go if you want to relax, eat slowly, and chat with your pals for a bit.

All in all worth a try and I know I'll be back to sample more of these delish tacos!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in this area, great atmosphere and food delish. Service goes down hill if you're not ordering booze, servers become less attentive. Maître d has a poor attitude and doesn't pretend to care to accommodate."}
{"text":"Decided to have a casual night out with a friend at this spot. I have to say I was apprehensive despite all the negative reviews. 

We walked in 30 mins early. I had a reservation, so we asked if we could sit at the bar till then. The hostess said it was okay, that she could actually seat us right away. 

She was very friendly and even gave us a different table as we did not like the one chosen for us. I have to say we encountered four different employees during our stay and they were all very helpful and friendly.

Maybe we just lucky? Something tells me we didn't,  as I couldn't even really picture these people being rude. So we sat down and looked at the menu. Our first server helped me in finding a drink I'd like as I wanted to try something different. I decided on a pear type of drink with 2 shots of vodka, very tasty.

We ordered the chips with the three different combination dips, the Mexican corn, carne asada taco, pollo frito and their taco of the day (philly cheesesteak. 

The food was very filling I have to say! I don't understand why people are thinking that the tacos are very small and not worth the value. We could hardly finish. 

I also don't find the price of the tacos expensive at all. These tacos are little creations of goodness.. what do you expect?. If you want cheap theres always Taco Bell?.

I most enjoyed the carne asada and the Philly cheesesteak. I will definitely pass next time on the corn and the pollo frito. The corn just wasn't that special and didn't stand out to me. It honestly tasted like something I've made at home.

I didn't dig the coleslaw in the pollo frito taco. To me it just didn't blend well with the other flavours. That's just my opinion but don't be afraid to try it because you might like it.

I am looking forward to coming back to try the other options. I really like the texture of the tacos! You can tell how homemade they are. Nice and soft with just the right amount of bite.

Overall, we enjoyed our night. We weren't rushed or made to feel uncomfortable. Mind you, I will update my review as I will be coming back with my man very soon!

On another note, I really enjoy the vibe of this place. Totally hipster atmosphere and the music is just straight banging! Loved every song they were playing. You might not want to bring your kids here as it might be uncomfortable for them as it is loud!

Look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Boo for no take-away. What restaurant doesn't do take-away? Really good corn and paletas though. But food wise, Seven lives in Kensington is better #sorrynotsorry"}
{"text":"Rating 3.5

Not my favourite taco spot but it does the job when you have a craving! Had the cauliflower and baja fish taco. Would recommend the fish taco over most of the flavours offered. 

Corn was good - the sauce was a good pairing. The ceviche was ok, sour and the mango kind of overpowered the dish. 

Usually also very busy so I recommend making a reservation!"}
{"text":"Tacos was really good especially tuna ceviche. I gave it 4 star bec we waited for half an hr. only to find out we had to wait another 10mins. bec they made a mistake. They thought we only said for two but we asked for table for 3. Then we had to wait another 15mins for our tacos. Is it worth the wait? not really. And the music was too loud it's defeaning + everyone's yelling at each other."}
{"text":"There's not much to say other than this place was over priced. Tacos and empanadas were very small, but I admit that the presentation looked nice. Flavors came together nicely. I had the cod and chicken tacos. Two tacos will not fill you up. The spacing was tight... Super uncomfortable. Service was a bit scattered. I don't think I'll be coming here again."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for a really long time so I was excited when the opportunity presented itself. My friends were already there and when I joined them we waited in the cramped \"entrance\" for about 30 minutes. Finally, I asked if our table was ready and they said yes it is. A couple minutes later they took us upstairs to our seats. 

I ordered the wings which were good. Nothing especially fantastic, but good. Like I've had better and I've had worse. While we waited for our tacos they played the new Drake/Future tape which was cool, I guess? idk.

Our tacos came and they were yummy. Decent fare, I liked it. I found it weird though that they grouped all the tacos together. Basically they didn't serve each person at the table what they ordered just put it on the table for us to figure out. The drink I had was okay. Not too strong or weak.

I ordered churros for desert and my friends and I split it. It was my first time having a churro and definitely the highlight of my meal. When it was time to give us the bill they didn't split it. We each had to pay what we wanted and calculate it ourselves including tax? Super inconvenient and I can imagine a pain after a few drinks. 

There are 3 washrooms servicing the entire restaurant and from how cramped it was in there I could tell they had definitely skimped on space. It's a cool spot but completely overhyped in my opinion. Good for Instagram pictures and whatnot but not authentic and kind of mediocre considering price."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos, very nice blend of ingredients. Loved the tortilla chips and dip. Amazing street corn."}
{"text":"Really nice vibe. The food was just ok though. We got fish & chicken taco. Also, the hostesses took forever to sit us when there was table available."}
{"text":"Went tonight and I must say we were quite disappointed. The menu was very limited, the mushroom empanada was good, but a little greasy and only one for $9, definitely not worth it. The tacos were good, but in my opinion not worth $5 - $7/each good. The cod taco was tasty, but overwhelmed by all the pickled beets which has a strong vinegar flavour.  My husband was really looking forward to the tres leches dessert and it was not as good as other Mexican restaurants. Will not come again as it seems to be trying to be a trendy modern restaurant instead of an authentic Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our meal on the patio, which only has 2 tables.  Each taco was about $5, it was filled to the top!  Enjoyed the beef cheek tacos.  Only problem with the in cod we trust taco was that it had too much pickled cabbage and took away from the crispness and flavour of the fried cod.  The dip platter was great and very fresh.  The avocado and mango salad was a bit too mushy, if they use mangoes that wasn't that ripe, which can add texture to the salad would be great.  Overall, would come back again for Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and it was not busy at all. Ordered the sangria, chips and corn salsa, Mexican street corn and a couple tacos. My favourite was definitely the corn salsa and chips which were very flavourful. Otherwise, everything else was really good but not better than other taco places I've been to in the city. This location is great however for the large patio. Also, service was attentive. Overall a great way to spend a sunny summer afternoon. I would come back for sure."}
{"text":"I visited the John street location which I really enjoyed. This location is just as good if not better. The restaurant is quite big inside. We came on a friday night at 6pm and it was not busy at all yet. They were playing great music which provided a fun atmosphere. Had the bass taco which was a special on fridays which was delicious. Also tried the cauliflower taco which was also decent but fell apart completely. The mexican street corn was delicious and the tortilla chips are the best I've had in Toronto. Service was fine. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Sick all night after eating there. Also the servers are rude. Not sure why. Its too bad - I think it was the ceviche that made me sick. Everything else tastes great...but I feel a bit traumatized now."}
{"text":"I love the quality of the food... a little pricey and the portions were a little smaller than I hoped for but the quality is worth it!! The Guac is to die"}
{"text":"This place was a letdown. Had the chorizo meatballs to start - very plain and not much flavour, not to mention luke warm (maybe reheated and not fresh?).  Also had the chips with guacamole which were not that great either. I expect top notch guac at a mexican place so this was a letdown. Had a variety of tacos and they were all ok but definitely not worth the price (5 or 6 bucks each). The service was ok but it was way too loud especially with a couple of large groups there. It was cool to see how they redecorated the old philthys but I wouldn't recommend this place.  I wish this place well but I don't see it lasting."}
{"text":"Food is tasty, but very overpriced and the atmosphere is not relaxing. Like eating in a nightclub.

A friend of mine loves Mexican food (but has a sensitivity to cilantro) so she asked for hers without. She was told they do not make substitutions and 'cannot compromise the visual integrity of the taco' by leaving it off. That statement sums up the place - pretty pompous. 

For amazing, authentic tacos that are more than reasonably priced I suggest Tenoch on St Clair. However if you don't mind your meal price being more reflective of hip atmosphere and location than authentic Mexican cuisine, La Carnita would be more your jive."}
{"text":"Sub standard service in an overly loud environment made for a disappointing night out with friends. The food was mediocre at best, the chips were seasoned and the queso was cold (major points against for any Mexican joint worth its weight). I wouldn't come back even if I lost a bet."}
{"text":"Did not expect the place to be so crowded!!! It was my first time there, so chose chicken breast tacos, as it is always the safest option.....amazing!!! Worth my money!! Long live La Carnita!!!"}
{"text":"This is not my first time here. I really like coming to this place for tacos! Although they have a small menu, the food taste great. You should definitely try out their Mexican sodas and their corn - you won't regret it! Place plays loud music, servers are quick and friendly, and location is bigger. Definitely does get super busy at peak times."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend's birthday and my first impression of the place was small, hole in the wall, insanely loud, and insanely delicious.  

We started off with the empanadas, their special, and it was absolutely delicious.  The outer pastry/bread layer was crisp and the inside was juicy.  

We then tried a couple tacos and we had the following: 

1) Beef cheek - I actually don't know what the hype is about this taco.  Their beef cheek was definitely tender and it was no doubt, delicious.  I felt that it was good but it wasn't anything too too special. 

2) Carnita - I felt that the pork again was very tender.  However, I felt that this taco was the least flavourful amongst all the ones that I tried.  It was served as a soft taco so maybe the flavour was absorbed into the taco. 

3) In Cod We Trust - One of my absolute favourites. The cod was fried to perfection and the picked red cabbage made the taco pop!  This one is a must try. 

4) Tostada de Ceviche - MY FAVOURITE.  Words cannot describe how delicious this taco was.  This taco was a hard taco and the ceviche was indescribably good.  Thinking about it makes me salivate.  Definitely an absolute must try!!!

My friends & I then had dessert.  We tried

- Tres de Leche - I was much to full to actually be evaluating dessert properly but the inner part (so the cake & cream) were delicious.  What really ruined it for me was the peanut.  The peanuts really just...overpowered the flavour of EVERYTHING.  It wasn't too enjoyable.  

- Churros - delicious.  I think the reason why I found them so enjoyable was that they had the sweet taste of cinnamon and sugar on a fried cake-like texture stick.  You cannot go wrong with butter + sugar + cinnamon + cake thrown together and deep fried."}
{"text":"Beyond terrible service.  After being seated at a table for 5, I was told that - in fact - my group could not have that table.  I would have to get up and leave. (Presumably b/c they had screwed up a reservation).  Just beyond anything I've ever seen in the service industry.  No attempt to make it up to us.  We were literally just put out on the street.    And the problem is, in this city the instagram-sheeple make it possible for any resto with a hint of hipster holiness to think it's acceptable to act this way."}
{"text":"The tacos and the like are REALLY delicious!

However delicious these tiny delights  may be, the price will be more than you think it would cost.

I highly, HIGHLY recommend the \"Lunch Prixe Fix\" for $15.99 in order to get the most bang for your buck as oppose to buying singles and double tacos.

Overall, I can recommend La Carnita for first-time customers so they can experience a pretty good taco outside of Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos, loved everything I had. Absolutely delicious. Good tequila selection as well. Fair price, decent service, and delicious tacos."}
{"text":"Best food ever. Tacos + cocktails are always amazing. The pepitas (popsicles) and churros are always a must."}
{"text":"Ive been to the west side location a few times and instantly fell in love. The new east side location has the same amazing food, and great ambience just like there college location."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant on my first visit that I went back a week later to try some more tacos. Unfortunately this restaurant does not take reservations as per their website unless you have a big group... So two of us showed up at around 7-8 pm on a Friday and got seated around 30-45 minutes later. The second visit, I was having an early dinner around 5 pm and was seated immediately. Highlights are the Mexican Street Corn and the Pollo Frito taco, definitely my two favourite items from their menu. Things I was excited about but were let down by are the Paletas (popsicles), In Cod We Trust taco, and their Friday special taco (another fish taco). I just found their battered fish too greasy."}
{"text":"The abundance of annoying screaming kids completely ruined this experience. Food was ok, if no kids were guaranteed I would give them another try since I went during the first few weeks of opening. If you want to dine without kids then stick to college location."}
{"text":"I visited the La Carnita college street location this week. I had the trio dips and between me and my friend we got the Ceviche, beef taco, fish taco, and fried chicken taco. And we got the paleta (Popsicle) for dessert! They have a large beer selection too.

Trio chip and dip - I liked the avocado dip the best, it was creamy and flavourful with a bit of spice in it. The other dips corn and spicy was not comparable to the avocado dip at all but still tasty.

Tacos - the tacos are the staple at la Carnita and it was great. It only has one taco shell so I got messy eating it. Comparably I like when taco joints give two shells on the bottom so I can make the portions more bite size. But overall it was definitely worth the trip.

Ceviche - very flavourful dish! Classic ceviche. It wasn't as fresh as the ceviche I have had at Kensington market but still one great dish.

 Paleta - cookies and cream is the Popsicle I got and it was yummy! It didn't look very good though because it has too much cookie crumble on top of the vanilla but it tasted like a giant ice cream cookie :) 

I definitely want to go back and try more beers and Popsicles!"}
{"text":"The food is good but way overpriced... There are better tasting Mexican places downtown for a fraction of the cost"}
{"text":"This place was amazing ! Was super packed

I only tried the vegetarian tacos and I wasn't even missing the meat !"}
{"text":"First things first, It was really hard to find the restaurant on Queen Street in Riverdale. They do not have their name on their storefront and you can only locate the restaurant by looking at the skull on the sign. Highly recommend the restaurant to at least put their name on the sign so people are aware that La Carnita has a location in Riverdale. 

Seated swiftly and the service here was great. The tacos here are big and were worth the price. Ordered: Mexican Street Corn (2pc), In Cod We Trust, Carnita, and Tostada De Ceviche. Also ordered aqua fresca as a side drink. The food here was decent. I really enjoyed the Tostada De Ceviche the most as it really changed the Taco game for me. The Mexican Street Corn was alright. The Carnita was slightly too salty for my taste buds and for the cod, it was not the best Cod Taco I had. But overall, it was still good. My friend had the Pollo Frito and the Beef Cheek, and she really recommends those tacos over the Carnita and the Cod. And unfortunately, I would not get the aqua fresca again as it was really watered down. 

Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos (and corn on the cob). Highly recommend this place. Definitely a contender to Grand Electric...

Beware to those that are looking for a quiet dining experience - this my not be the place for you..."}
{"text":"Amazing...love the street corn and margaritas on tap. Easily one of the go to taco places in the city."}
{"text":"My fav for date night hands down. Arrive early there are always line ups. If you have a friend from out of town and want to show them toronto flava this is the spot"}
{"text":"We had the nicest bartender / server, I wish I could remember his name because he was chill, made a few jokes and gave great recommendations. Love the atmosphere for any occasion. I tried the cod taco, tuna tostadas, chicken and beef taco; All great and had different toppings. I love the Mexican street corn, it's a must order for me!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Just trying to find it, we had to spot the SKULL to know we were in the right place. Their tacos, and in general all their dishes were excellent. I cannot really say this is traditional Mexican food, but it is very good food, a little more gourmet than expected. The service was great as well. We enjoyed ourselves a lot. It's very lively and it gets busy, so arrive early. Make sure you finish off with some churros!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this restauranr four stars because their Saturday special chicken escabeche taco is amazing!! It's the best one out of all the tacos. If I went on any other day other than a Saturday, I probably would have been disappointed since the rest of the tacos are not nearly as good as the Saturday special. The tostada de ceviche and pollo Frito were good too. We did not enjoy the cod or the beef cheek. We had the tres leche cake for dessert. It was amazing, probably one of the best I've ever had and I have a huge sweet tooth. Service is great, overall good experience at a good price point."}
{"text":"Certainly La Carnita knows how to make delicious tacos. Each taco order comes with one taco so I decided to mix and match and tried a fish one, a chicken one, and a steak one.

In Cod We Trust (favourite)
The cod was soft, fluffy, and lightly battered on the outside. It also comes with \"Voltron sauce\" which is La Carnita's secret sauce named after a cartoon super robot lol. It uses \"tamari\" soy sauce as the base and I felt that it paired well with the cod. The extra cabbage, green apple, and cilantro on top complemented well with the fluffy cod by adding some crunch to it.

Pollo Frito (almost tied with steak but I ranked this as my second favourite because it was slightly sweeter from the honey)  
Crispy chicken thigh, peanut mole,honey, Rossy's hot sauce, green cabbage & salsa fresca
The chicken was nice and sweet and also tender and slightly crispy on the outside. If you like sweet stuff definitely try the pollo. Beware though that while the chicken is sweet some parts of the taco can also be spicier than expected from hot sauce.

Carne Asada - Grilled Beef Steak, chipotle mayo, Tomatillo salsa, Lime Avocado, Crispy Shallots & cilantro. The steak was good but the salsa and mayo were a little too spicy (tasted like spicy mayo but stronger). For tacos I preferred the chicken and fish because of the lighter texture to go with the delicate tortilla

For starters we tried the ancho bbq wing but in comparison to the tacos they were more dry and somewhat small. I probably won't order the wings again but definitely try out these tacos!!

Seating can be crammed but all in all great casual lively atmosphere with dim lighting; and flavourful tacos that come with a good amount of toppings."}
{"text":"I went in and had a reservation - I went with a friend on a weekend and it was pretty packed. We ordered a few items and the food was acceptable. The tacos were \"ok\" and the chips that I ordered were \"ok\". To be honest, I wasn't planning to write a review about this place because it was just \"ok\" and there isn't much to tell about my tale, no detailed notes for this one.

The whole struggle began as I wanted my cheque. They gave me my bill right away, and I put my card on the table. I wanted to pay my bill.

Nope, they were having none of that - my bill wasn't going to get paid. It was probably at minute 5 of my card being on top of my bill when I followed up with the waitress to pay my bill. At this moment, I started the chronograph on my sub-par watch, trust me - it's accurate enough for these purposes. 

My watch showed 7 minutes and 13 seconds before I was able to pay. In total that's a ~12 minute wait to pay my bill. That's longer than I waited for my food. To add salt to the wound, 2 other customers were being served first with the credit card terminal before I got to pay my bill... and they asked after me. I don't value my time on a Sunday that much, but this was an utter waste of my time.

I didn't know what the issue was, maybe my follow up was insufficient. Maybe the girl beside me dress in a fully-red adidas track-suit had a more commanding presence than me. Maybe my card just camouflaged perfectly with the table. It was a busy night, but that doesn't mean it's ok to forget about a customer.

I think it would be good business for American Express to make a card in fluorescent yellow that has a high-pitched beep after you press a button to make sure you can't be ignored. I wasn't even obnoxious towards the waitress. The person I was with can testify to that. So if anyone knows someone at American Express who can help me out and bring up my idea with the card design team, that would be appreciated.

Edit: According to the person who is sitting beside me, I am a plug - I don't disagree."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best tacos I've ever had. Chorizo and beef tacos were sublime. Lots of layers of flavor. Atmosphere was a Little bit dark and service left much to be desired but the food was phenomenal"}
{"text":"Okay so I have come back again to this location.  I have created monsters/fans by telling my friends who were excited to come (for some of us it was not our first visit!).  So when we walked in one of us went to see if there was a crazy lineup for Sweet Jesus; the hostess asked us the usual question of where our other person was and how long....not a fan of this but whatev's

So we were brought upstairs again and then given a table with bench seating.  The benches where really heavy.....it takes a really good shove or coordinated heave for you to move the bench.

So we sat down and wen through the menu of what to eat and drink.  Knowing that we all wanted to have Mexican Street Corn that was why we came; however there were other items we ordered:

Michelada - Spicy with Dos Equis (they called Chiladas); the way they named it seemed a bit hipster-ish
House Margarita
Water for the driver

Chips and 3 kinds of Salsa (Corn Salsa; our fav!, Spicy Black Bean, and Guacamole)
Two orders of Mexican Street Corn
Tuna Ceviche Tostada
Three orders of - In Cod We Trust 

Now the Michelada was delicious, the Margarita was meh....they really need someone to show them how to make a good one!!!  Really it was just lime with Tequila again.

The Chips with 3 kinds of Salsa has always been my fav, and now my friends favourite too!!!  The corn salsa has something about it, that just makes it beyond good.  They really should bottle it and sell it!

The Mexican Street Corn (aka crazy corn) was messy, spicy and all good.  The roasting of it made it great however will have to come back when corn is in season because they were a bit on the small side.

Bring on the Tacos/Tostada!!!
One of the people I was with had the tostada and they couldn't stop raving about it, the fact that La Carnita does not omit the cilantro for those who do not like it made me steer clear of it despite my love for fresh fish.

The in cod we trust was nice, the fish was light, the voltron sauce needed and the apple with the pickle cabage made it both acidic and sweet which was needed.  I now know why they started this business based on this taco.  The voltron sauce was nice, would have wished a bit more and if they too sold this in bottles!!!

Yes will come back; never in a group bigger than four; will have to try coming back during lunch.


Now onto Sweet Jesus!!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place for a great Mexican fair. 

Been to all the top Mexican restaurants in Toronto and this is one of the better locations for food. Everything is individual pieces. The Tuna Taco is on of the best I've had in the city. The chicken was ok but the weakest of the limited menu. 

Everything is fresh and has great taste. 

The house made hot sauce is also worth nothing. 

If your a sweet tooth lover you'll need to stop at another place in Little Italy. Very happening place."}
{"text":"Went here for a work lunch. They had a $16.99 prix fixe lunch menu, which came with 1 app (chips or corn), 2 tacos (any taco, but some have additional charge), and 1 dessert (polenta or churro).

The chips came. The guac dip was not bad, but the chips were really too crunchy for my liking, but thats just my personal preference. The tacos were not bad, had the chicken and steak one. It was kind of too messy to eat by hand, so I had to resort to using a fork. Dessert was mildly impressive. I had the churro, but it came in this cheap little paper cup with caramel at the bottom, and was super crunchy. I've had better churros from the food trucks during CNE.

I also ordered a $4 fresh mango juice. It tasted a lot like the tetrapack mango juices you buy at the supermarket, but perhaps its still \"fresh\". For a glass that small, with 3 large ice cubes, there really isn't much space for real juice. I mean really, $4 for a small glass of mango juice? Me thinks not. 

Service was okay, nothing really out of the norm for me. 
Not really worth the price...nothing particularly mind-blowing here.."}
{"text":"At Yonge/Ellington...great location but that's where it ended for me. There are 2 different sections of this location. The upper restaurants area & the lower more bar-like area. We were in the bar area. 

To start with the place wasn't busy but the service was very slow. We didn't have a server per-say but we're served by several people. The food was only ok but far from great. I ordered the Chorizo Sausage Quesadilla. It was good but small with limited taste. The Nachos with 3 dips (guacamole/corn/salsa) was ok but way over priced at almost $16.00! The service in general was not good. No plates, I had to get up to get my own napkins & almost zero check back. There's other Mexican restaurants in the city that are way better...go there! I won't go back here."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Every time we ordered, whether it was food or drinks, the waitress (Victoria) would go to the bar area to chat with a friend who was dinning at the restaurant. Only after 5-10 minutes of catching up with her friend would she put any of our orders in or bring us our soda. BTW refills are not free and the waitress failed to mention this. 

Would have given 2 stars because food was good but we had to return first glasses of water that were served bc there were particles of something in them."}
{"text":"So unhappy with my visit at La Carnita. The venue is nice, the food was OK if still somewhat forgettable but the service, oh goodness have I not been served that badly in ages. 

There was 11 of us and we reserved in advance. We are told there would be a 18% gratuity and we were fine with that. 

The first drink orders were taken and served promptly. When came the time to order we were ready to do it separately and we were told flatly no. It would be one order and they would be delivered at different random times. 

Now I understand that formula can work up to like 4 or 6 people but 11, seriously? So whenever the food was coming we had to yell over the music to dispatch the food ourselves. Fun times. 

Some of the food we ordered was missing and some other orders were delivered twice. 

When came the time to pay it was oh so pleasant. Firstly they overcharged us for some tacos we never ordered. We had to argue back and forth to take them off. It took an awful long time for them to process all our payments. 

On top of it one of the waiter told us we should be happy they took away some items from the bill. With an attitude. Please. 

The washrooms were also quite dirty. There was a lot or paper towels scattered all over the floor of the two boots I've been into. 

Now, I never wished I'd give a one star, especially coming from the service industry but if the manager is reading the comments he or she should seriously review their team customer service skills, because it felt like they were doing whatever they wanted and could not care less.

Much less attitude and some decent professionalism please."}
{"text":"Can I give this place ten stars!? I guess 5 will have to do!

Came here with a girlfriend just the other night. It was my first time at a La Carnita and I had browsed the menu ahead of time. 

We started by sharing the tortillas and 3 dips. It came with a bean queso, guacamole, and corn salsa. I loved them all! I'm usually quite picky when it comes to Mexican food as I don't like onions or tomatoes but I could enjoy everything on this plate. Yum! Only note, I just wish the tortilla chips that were served came out warmed as well. 

Taco time - I tried the \"In Cod we Trust\" and the one with fried cheese. I wish I had ordered 3 of the fried cheese ones, not that my belly could actually fit that many. It was just the most delicious taco I've ever had. Then I tried the fish taco next and couldn't believe how amazing it was too!

While the tacos are a bit pricey, the layers of flavour really justifies the prices. I was too full for desert but will definitely be coming to give the churros a try. 

Now to take my taco-loving fiance back to show him the best tacos in Toronto!

-Ashley Marie"}
{"text":"I'm glad that I had the chance to try some other taco joints in order to have a comparison.  La Carnita just blew them all out of the water!  I'm still thinking about their deep fried chicken thigh taco!

Their nachos and dip is a large portion and great for sharing with a few people.  Although tasty, it was a bit too much for two.  Their soft tacos were delicious, fresh and loaded with flavour. 

Located in Toronto's Little Italy neighborhood, the restaurant had a laid back yet upscale feel.  The interior is trendy and the atmosphere is similar to a loud pub.  There is a small patio in the front and the seating arrangements are mainly communal tables.     

I'll be sure to come back to try more tacos."}
{"text":"The menu is a small selection of shareable starters, tacos around the $5 mark, daily specials, and a few desserts. The affordable price-point means you can comfortably enjoy a beer and a taco, even on a starving student budget, or go out with friends and order a bit of everything and be happily surprised when the bill comes around."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere and delicious food, but the service is definitely below average. 

We ordered the nachos and three dips, and the scorpion wings for apps alongside some drinks. I also tried the Pollo Frito Taco & the Crispy Cotija which were exploding with flavour and very filling. Something else, which was not great, was that they served all the tacos in communal plates, which made it difficult for our group of 11 to distinguish who ordered what when the food came. 

The most frustrating thing we experienced other than the the extremely slow service, was the cake cutting fee they wanted to charge us for bringing a birthday cake. I can understand if we brought a bottle of wine from outside or another food item in competition with their menu items, but a birthday cake should not be subject to an \"extra cake cutting fee\"

Overall, this restaurant is more hype than anything. it's highly unlikely I will come back or recommend this restaurant to anyone else. 

Side note, they also do not split bills"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and had a fantastic time here! My friend and I shared Roasted Pork Belly Sope, Crispy Chicken Torta, Cochinita Pibil Tostada and Chorizo Sausage Taco. Everything was good except the sope which was very sour. I think it would've been fine if I ate that first because I feel like the other dishes \"ruined\" the taste of the sope. I also ordered a iced Mexican mocha that tasted more like chocolate milk than a mocha. I did not enjoy this drink at all so stay away from it if you're expecting coffee flavour from it!"}
{"text":"Went for birthday celebration dinner tonight with my girlfriends. It was pretty busy and we liked the vibe of the place. Had some nice draft beers, although for 10 oz size not worth 10 bucks each. Not a good start. Chips and 3 dip appetizers were good but again small portions for the price.  Tacos very tasty chicken and steak. Overall it's a good spot but the portions and prices are at odds. Not sure we would go back. Unless they offer better value. Staff very friendly."}
{"text":"We were unlucky to be served by Katerina whom wasn't very friendly in answering food questions and worse she doesn't know how to do grade school math.  We pre-calculated our bill since she gave us one bill with both our orders, but over charged us and refused to listen that her math was wrong so I gave her a low tip for my inconvenience and the fact I still over paid for my portion.  They brought our food on wrong and didn't apologize and understand why it was an issue, and told us to eat, then switch plates after we finish one taco so we can eat the other taco from the other person's plate (we're female friends and not on dates and even so why would we want to eat from each other's plate like animals?!)!  They put half of each of our tacos on the other person's  plates and I had to switch the tacos myself prior to eating, as the waitress watched us when clearly it's her job \"hello\"!  Food wasn't great either.  We had tacos and the beef cheek had an odd livery taste, chicken was decent.  My friend said the pork taco  had a weird taste and her cocktail was too strong.  We didn't order fish tacos because my friend came previously and said the fish was tasteless (unseasoned bland), but the sauce was okay.  Additionally, the customer at a table behind me me had his chair pulled right up against mine the entire time and he kept bumping it.  My friend arrived early before me and she was the only customer on the patio, but the waitress tried to rush her. Everything was unpleasant except for my friend's company.

P.S.  I tried calling them and realized I couldn't get through because their phone number  listed on their receipt is wrong!  Tells you even they think they're forgettable."}
{"text":"Loco for elotes. 

I don't know about you but when I have good food, I like to tac(o) about it. Enter La Carnita, home of best ever elotes in Canada. How good you ask? Well just imagine a cob of fresh, sweet corn grilled to perfection, then loaded with butter, rich crema and fresh queso, topped off my sprigs of cilantro and wedges of lime. Each bite is like a party of creamy, crunchy, sweet decadence in my mouth. YUM. If I wasn't lactose or interested in preserving the state of my waistline, I would have the entire order of two to myself all day, err' day. 
Taco wise, they've all been great. Sometimes on the salty side, but all meats are fantastically seasoned and each taco has great garnishes. Are they super authentic to street taco carts in Mexico? No, but only because La Carnita caters to an audience with different demands and preferences.  As a refined north American restaurant, it's tacos reflect what is preferred in Canadian taste profiles. What this means is although the fresh tortillas and proteins are similar to authentic Mexican tacos, they're a bit more dressed up garnish wise than its southern cousins.  For myself I just ask for less sauce or sauce on the side and I get to enjoy it how I want. Having been here over 5 times, LA Carnita is definitely a must try in my books. Plus it's cool hip vibe makes me feel just a bit younger (if only for an hour)."}
{"text":"I was looking forward dining here as I enjoyed a dinner at the college location. Service was good but the food was just okay. Most of dishes didn't have much flavour. Little disappointing."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is pretty great for a place to hang with friends, dimly lit bar with young staff. Food was alright though. I had the street corn and a couple of tacos. Slightly overpriced for what you get. Probably wouldn't come back, not because it's bad, but because I'd rather try other places."}
{"text":"Good tacos and the Mexican corn is really good. Ended with the churros which is never a bad idea. Got a good spot and service was good as well."}
{"text":"Great tasting tacos! We ordered the Mexican Street Corn, In Cod We Trust, Pollo Fritto, Carnita, and the churros with the house made cajeta sauce. Everything tasted great! The stand outs were the pollo Fritto and the churros. The churros were the perfect size and so crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. We would've maybe wanted it to come with a chocolate sauce but the cajeta sauce was great as well."}
{"text":"Praising for La Carnita is long overdue. A place you can go on any night and expect the same friendly service and amazingly tasty tacos and more. The experience as a whole is worth the 30 minute wait that has become expected of this popular spot. Very cool and trendy place to meet up with friends and have some great food. The corn is a must to start along with guac and chips! All the tacos are fantastic, although last time around the chicken pollo was the home run. Cod is tops as well. You won't go wrong spending your dough at La Carnita. Head to the pub West on College if you have to wait for a table, will add to the experience of a great night."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday evening with some girlfriends as we heard it was currently a taco hot spot in Toronto. Server was great, very friendly and personable although slow service overall. Music was hot if you're into old-school r&b and hip hop. Had a good vibe. Ordered nachos with bean dip - loved it (I'm a sucker for tortilla chips and dip) although the chips were on the salty side. Mexican street corn was yummy as well - good as a shareable. Mushroom empanada was mediocre - for $9/ 1 empanada - I felt it wasn't worth the price point. Tacos were \"okay\" overall. Overpriced and over hyped in my opinion - have definitely had better outside of Toronto. We tried the haddock, chorizo, chicken and steak. I personally enjoyed the chicken the most. They have a great 100% agave tequila selection which we all loved. Definitely worth a try at least once but wouldn't say it would be my \"go-to\" in a Mexican craving  situation."}
{"text":"A friend had picked this place out because we were feeling Mexican and needed a place downtown. 

Between the 4 of us we shared the following:
-Torilla Chilps with a side of Guacamole and Corn Salsa
-Rice and Corn Frituras
-Tostada de Ceviche

I personally had:
Tacos: the La Carnita (pork) and the Cod (fish) and the horchata to drink. 

I had to pay for parking across the street that was $15. Couldn't find the entrance to get to La Carnita because I didn't realize it was the abandoned-looking house next to Sweet Jesus. Once my friend found me outside, we waited for another 10-15 minutes to get seats. The place is packed!

However...the music was awesome! 90's hip hop and r&b - thank you! Yes, please...that's my jam! That- and the lights were dim...this phased-out light clubber was singing along to 112's 'Only You' and LL Cool J's 'Something Like a Phenomenon.' We got seated upstairs.

The Tortilla Chips were nice - had a hint of lime - similar to Tostitos' Hint of Lime chips, but their chips were housemade. I'd say the Corn Salsa was a winner and I'd definitely get that again. Fresh and bright flavours - this did not disappoint. 

The Rice and Corn Frituras were good, but they were a bit heavy after having the chips and dips. The order comes with 3 deep fried rice balls with a dipping sauce on the side. They weren't greasy, but after having the corn salsa, I felt that I could've skipped this part. 

The Tostada de Ceviche was made of fresh scallops. I found the plantain chips that it came with to be quite nice, but I wouldn't order this specifically again. Only because that corn salsa was a really great starter -there needs to be room for the tacos.

The La Carnita was pulled pork and the cod was in a deep fried batter (both in a soft taco shell). Both were good, but I felt that if I put that corn salsa on it (or if I had more of it, I would've put it on myself) it would've really made it memorable. The tacos are generally of good quality ingredients, but I've had more memorable flavours. 

Overall, La Carnita is a high end taco joint which you can take your friends to for a casual night out and good vibes. The place is dark and it's packed. Maneuvering through the place somewhat feels like maneuvering through a club. But with good music - who cares. Get the corn salsa - if I had an unconditional supply of it - i'd put that s&^t on everything."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Gave away our table because allegedly we weren't there within 10 minutes of our reso even though we were because they alert you via text and there is a time stamp. They also gave away the table of 2 ladies before us for same reason. Then they lied and said they were cleaning our table but another hostess admitted they gave it away. Then we got sat upstairs and sat for 10 minutes with no service. The servers upstairs had time to dance to the music but didn't feel it was necessary to serve us. A table sat after us and got served...so we left. Didn't try the food. Not worth our time. Lots of other Mexican places in town and restaurants in general. Will not be back to this location or College."}
{"text":"Super loud and crowded, but the tacos are amazing!  Small portions that are not expensive, so you can try multiple things without feeling like a pig."}
{"text":"We had high expectations ... but...
We started by waiting at the bar for our table - which was totally fine as we were there on a Friday during Jays playoffs and had a super pleasant bartender who served us immediately. Eventually we were seated upstairs when our table was ready. It smelled so awful upstairs that we couldn't handle it for our whole dinner. We went back to the bar. Our host told us she had a table on the main floor and would clean it and come grab us but she never returned or checked in on us. We stayed at the bar. The food was good but not great. Definitely not \"bad\" Mexican, but I don't think I'll go out of my way to come back. Kudos to the bartenders for making the best of the situation."}
{"text":"The fish tacos (oh my cod) were amazing and the chicken tacos were very spicy but alright. We also got the appetizer chips and dip, which I didn't really like. The dips were corn, guac, and this spicy one that seemed like hummus. I wish they stocked with the basic salsa, guac and sour creams because the chips were good."}
{"text":"You will never eat a tastier cob of corn than the corn offered at La Carnita. Although you pay a pretty penny for it! Yikes!

The prices seem cheap but once you see how small the tacos are, you will need to order several items to make sure you don't leave hungry.

Not great for vegetarians.

La Carnita has the obligatory deconstructed/found art object light fixtures found in all of the Toronto hot spots."}
{"text":"La Carnita in leslieville has a deep cool space. It has a nice atmosphere to it, and would be a decent place to go with groups I think.

The menu has similar fare you find at other taco/mexican restaurants. A lot of things we ordered we've had at Playa Cabana, who also has several locations in Toronto.

Playa Cabana I felt had better 'street corn' as it had a lot more zing there. There was a lot more lime and heat in that one. The corns here are yummy, but its mostly from the char of the cook and the cheese it's covered in. The other thing I felt was better at Playa Cabana was the tres leche cake. The one here was yummy, but the cake itself here didn't have the same soak and absorption than the one at Playa Cabana.

Now where La Carnita really hit the mark was their tacos. The tacos were from what I remember better than Playa Cabana's. I tried a few different kinds. The fish (In Cod We Trust), the chicken (Pollo Frito) and Mexican Chorizo and I would get all of them again. I also liked how they each had their own thing going on. Out of the three I'd say the chicken one was the most unique to me. All three tacos had a good acidity to them which was key.

I'd totally go back to La Carnita, and would be interested to try the homemade popsicles next time!"}
{"text":"After an hour and a half wait for a table for 4 on a Saturday night, my friends and I were ready to devour tacos. Oh MAN was this place loud. We couldn't hear anything we were saying as the music was blaring off of a nearby speaker, I don't mean to be such a grandma but seriously, we couldn't hear anything and was literally yelling at each other until we gave up and just sat there.

So, I order the fish tacos \"in cod we trust\" but mentioned to the waitress that I'm allergic to apples(my throat will close up if consumed raw, it's pretty bad) and if she can dismiss that off my tacos. She rudely said no because it would mess with the menu and that I'd have to pick something else. I thought, you know what..I'll just pick it off myself because I love me some fish tacos anyways. So my food comes and to my surprise...the apples were just slivered pieces, neatly garnished on top of the tacos. I'd understand if it was mixed into a slaw or something in which they didn't wanna ruin the integrity of the taco but C'MON..it was such a simple request. Whatever..easy enough to remove but waste of apples for them. Food was just alright and not worth the money. Waitress could have been nicer and accommodating."}
{"text":"This location opened recently and they're doing a brisk business already - there's no shortage of customers - even on a Tuesday evening at 5:30 pm! I tried the Mexican corn appetizer (really tasty; not too spicy) and two types of tacos: the cod and the ceviche. Both were pretty spicy, and I meant to try another kind of taco from their menu, but the ceviche was so good that I just ordered another one! I wish they served sides with the tacos, but I guess they're going with a tapas feel, so keep that in mind if you arrive hungry. I wonder if they could do more veg apps that are not covered in cheese or deep fried?! You'll probably want to order at least a few tacos and a couple of apps and/or dessert. If you order drinks, expect the bill to be considerably higher.

I came here with a small group and appreciated that they didn't cram us into a tiny table, but the seating isn't built for comfort - the bench at our table was hard and tipped back and forth a bit - there's no place to hang your coats, so everything just kind of gets piled up next to wherever you happen to sit. I suppose this makes it easier to keep turning tables and maximize business, but it also made it hard to really relax. I get the feeling they are going for the retro \"hole in the wall\" diner feeling, but at least the bathrooms were extremely clean and well stocked."}
{"text":"Finally gave in and tried this newly opened La Carnita at Yonge/Eglinton area. 

Food was ok, not bad, but not great. We had the cod, beef, pork, tuna ceviche and the baja tacos. Again, not bad, but not great. The meatballs and the churros were good, though. 

The inside seating is a little dark and the music is way too loud! The patio seating was a little too packed. One less table (2 customer less, essentially) would make the space a little better for moving around. I literally got bumped multiple times by the servers trying to do their work, I don't blame them as the space is really tight.

As for the pricing, I find it a little pricier but not outrageously expensive for the food. Drinks, however, are pretty stiff ... no pun intended. 

If you must really try this place, eat your food and drink somewhere else :)"}
{"text":"Casual fun spot.  Great tacos .  Loved
The Mexican corn.  I recommend you make a reservation for dinner."}
{"text":"Food quality was good and everything was really delicious . Our waitress was really nice too but the host and the manager were really rude and not respectful at all !!! I was really shocked how they treated customers in such a manner !!!!
But we liked the food anyway so 4 star only for food and nice waitress"}
{"text":"Loveeee the tacos here! I didnt mind that the menu is pretty small because at least it easier for me to decide what to pick. Mexican corn id say is the crowd favorite. Me and my boyfriend sat in the long communal table and everyone sitting there ordered it. I think almost every table did and it did not disappoint. Tacos cost range from $4.25 to $6 per piece which isnt bad. Portions were acceptable. We ordered the cod and beef cheek. Both tasted fresh and of course amazing."}
{"text":"Had the $15.99 lunch special which included, a choice of side (salad, corn on the cob or chips and dip), 2 tacos and a dessert. 

The restaurant played good music and the waiter was helpful. The tacos were flavourful and loaded. I would only come for the lunch special because the tacos are kind of small for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Service is meh. It wasn't attentive nor nice. Took forever to flag down a waitress for the bill... just take my money!!

This location apparently is more spacious but the line up is still crazy. If you go during lunch (12PM) or dinner time, you gonna have to wait more than 30 mins. Food is a bit expensive with small portions as well. 

-Beef cheek taco $5.25
While the beef cheek was tender, I thought the overall flavor of the taco was underwhelming and bland. The taco was a bit too saucy and the tortilla was limp, and fell apart upon eating.

-In Cod We Trust taco $4.95
The cod was lightly battered with a nice crunch, and the fish was perfectly tender and moist. I found the tartness from the red cabbage and green apple to be quite overpowering though, perhaps just pick either one would have been good enough.

-Mexican Street Corn $8.5
You don't go to La Carnita and not order their famous Mexican corn. The combination of the rich creama and salty flavor from the queso anejo are incredible! A touch of chilli powder on top to give the succulent corn a nice kick"}
{"text":"Really good food but not the best experience.

The pitcher of Sangria was $50 and 90% ice. Rip off!! 

 I felt on edge and unwelcome at the restaurant.  Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I come here whenever I'm craving tacos and it hits the spot every time. The chips & guac and the mexican corn to start are delicious and set the tone. I always get a margarita to go along with the food - very refreshing. 
I recommend all the tacos but my favourites are Cojita, Carne Asada & the fish taco. Highly recommend the churros as well as the treats from Sweet Jesus"}
{"text":"I came here in between screenings at the TIFF Bell Lighthouse during a film festival. 

The good: This location is brighter than the College location, the staff is busy but friendly, and the food is just as tasty as the other location. I recommend the churros, pollo frito, mexican meatballs, and in cod we trust.

The bad: We waited 25 minutes for a table. The seating area is a bit cramped and it can take awhile to flag down your server as they speed walk back and forth across the large dining room. The kitchen can take awhile to cook your food. You will also have to shout to hear your dining companions as the sound reverberates on the hard surfaces."}
{"text":"I really like the Mexican style corn and the fish tacos. The margarita pitchers are also really good. The food is decent but I do not think it lives up to all the hype. Walk 3 blocks to Kensington and get the el trumpo tacos for half the price and double the flavour. 

Not the worst place to get a taco in the city but certainly not the best."}
{"text":"Very friendly and easy-going staff! Loved the cod tacos and the ribs!"}
{"text":"If you're a gin lover, La Carnita has one of the best gin with cucumber cocktails.

We ordered their nachos with all 3 dips - guac, salsa, and beans. I felt like all 3 dips were done very well and was delicious with the nachos. Then we got all of the tacos besides Crispy Cojita (I believe it's vegetarian). It was definitely filling and yummy, but I wasn't getting too much of the \"Mexican\" from it; in other words, after eating so much Mexican in the past year, food here at La Carnita is very American-ized and de-Mexicaned. So if you're not a big fan of Mexican but want tacos, this is a potential spot to check out.

Service gets a lot slower when the place starts to fill up.

Hipster and casual atmosphere, you can either dress up or dress down."}
{"text":"**Go here. Gonna spend money but it's worth it :)

Brought here by friends and it was great! The Tacos were delightful and sure you're paying $5-$8 per taco but the portions where actually pretty good. Each taco (chicken, beef and cod) we tried were jam packed with flavour and super smooth. The server was top-notch giving us newbies a run-down of the menu and encouraging us to try different things. A highlight of our trip."}
{"text":"Will not be returning. 
I came with a group of my girlfriends on a Sunday evening for her birthday and let me tell you what a disappointment this establishment is. Upon making the reservation for our table they informed us there would be a gratuity included with the bill no problem.. 
However, I felt because they new they would be charging us 18% of the bill, we were totally snaked from any real \"service\" at all. Not once did our waitress ask if we were doing ok, 
 not once did she ask if we wanted refills on our drinks, instead we had to remind her of them twice. Mind you, the place was NOT busy so I don't know what the deal was...
Our churros were stale, my food drenched in condiments rather than any shrimp at all and our bill came to a hefty 350$ with a generous 50$ gratuity charge.. LOL 
Over priced... service sucks"}
{"text":"La Carnita is quickly becoming my favourite Mexican spot in the city. 

They specialize in \"Mexican Street Food\", but with a twist - they use top notch ingredients and flavours. This means that yes, it will cost more (and yes, they don't want substitutions other than for allergies to maintain those flavours profiles), but it's absolutely worth it. 

Their Mexican street corn is a delicious take on Elote, street corn in Mexico, with delicious toppings, roasted to perfection. I highly recommend it, as well as their tortilla chips and guacamole, as appetizers. 

Their tacos are incredible! Paper-thin but firm tortillas housing amazing flavours combos. My personal favourite is their Carnitas taco, which is the perfect combination of juicy, crispy, and well-spiced pork and toppings. I could seriously just eat those as my entire meal :) Our tablemates loved the fish taco options, as well. 

With Sweet Jesus next door, their dessert options are equally epic. Save room!"}
{"text":"Great spot!

Greeted professionally at the door. Promptly seated.

Very solid beer and tequila selection.

Eclectic menu selections prepared very well.

Love the chips and 3 dips.

Worth going to!k"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here makes you feel as if you're in a club. It's noisy like a club and dark like a club. To have a proper conversation, my friends and I had to yell across the table. However, instead of ordering shots, you're getting wasted off tacos. 
I was here with two other friends on a Tuesday night and we were seated quickly. I was confused as to why we were seated at a medium sized communal table with a party of two just millimeters beside us. I was pretty irritated that this table was unreasonably small but my friends discouraged me from asking for different seating. 
I ended up ordering the special of the day (Squid the Kid) and In Cod We Trust. I'm not a huge seafood fan but I ended up loving the latter taco. The squid taco was average, and I'm being generous saying that. The way the tacos were presented was incredibly confusing. They're quite messy to eat but all the tacos came in \"communal plates\".
Our table also shared the tortilla chips with a trio of dips which were okay but I probably wouldn't order it again. My favourite dip was the guacamole while the bean dip was a favourite of my dining companions.
To finish off our meal, we had the paletas and seasonal fruit Tres Leche cake. The cake came with strange tasting and suspect cherries while the paletas were great, though I wished they were creamier. 
Since the menu is pretty small, I can't wait to try everything else."}
{"text":"The chips and three dips was really good. The cod taco was okay. I highly recommend the steak taco and corn. The food took very long to come out but that's okay we were enjoying the app."}
{"text":"Fantastic lengua tacos and I loved the margaritas. We came late on a weekday and we were able to be seated pretty quickly. The margaritas are a little pricey, but whatever. Server was pretty good, but there was a guy named Derek working that was super nice and hilarious. I'll be back for more beef cheek!"}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous! Carnitas has three reservation times 5,7,9. Why can't I reserve 9:30? I understand if I said 5:30 it would through off their timing for tables.  I  even suggested leaving a deposit."}
{"text":"Tried every taco on the menu there all pretty good. A couple things on the menu are very good. Winners are Cod, Tuna, corn on the cob, churros. The negative is the cocktails are over priced and the Beef cheeks arent really Beef cheeks. (Beef Cheeks are very fatty like bacon and have simular taste to bacon this was way too lean.) Why Four Stars? Great Value Food"}
{"text":"Took my friend here for her birthday. We had heard good things about it and not sure if it was cause the build up to it was too big, my expectations were set high.

We started off on the wrong foot as we were not allowed to sit until 3 members out of our party of 4 had arrived. (Understandable for a busy restaurant, but not a positive thing for a hungry customer)

We were seated after 30min wait from when everyone in our party arrived. Our order was quickly taken and the tacos came out really quickly! I had the carnitas and baha fish tacos. Food was decent/average but wouldn't say the tacos were to die for. Everything came quickly: food and bill! As if the server couldn't wait to hustle us out of the restaurant.

The most disappointing part of the meal was our drinks. I order margaritas for myself and my friend and it was most disappointing margarita I've ever had in my life. There was no flavour, basically just tastes like alcohol and ice. I'm not sure of it was a mistake but I was certainly upset that I had to pay $12-13 per glass and they were tiny!!! 

I would consider giving another location a shot at the tacos but I don't think I would ever have a margarita from here again."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall style exterior, amazing atmosphere inside. Food is outstanding and the service was attentive and genuine. 

Must haves. 
Mexican Street Corn 
Tostada de Ceviche
Pollo Frito"}
{"text":"Horrible experience! 
I read the amazing reviews before coming, thinking it would be a fantastic night out. 
But we ended up going to the hospital after dinner with stomach problems.
We shared the extremely salty nachos with salty guacamole. 
The tacos were just meh. 
Not coming back again."}
{"text":"First off, be prepared to wait because this place is usually packed to the brim with people. So if you're coming for a quick bite before venturing else where, you can forget about it. But that's always a good sign for awesome business. Also there's no reservations for under 8 people. 

The drinks are good. If the bartender knows how to make them obviously. Don't be turned off if your drink comes in a plastic cup. We got that because it was so busy. 

Their tacos are awesome! We had one of each as samplers and by the time we were done, my stomach's capacity was 4 times its original size. The best part is that for fish tacos, they didn't smell like fish at all. But completely worth it. The corn on the cob is crazy yummy. If you're planning on eating corn like a classy lady, pass up the opportunity. This is for sure going to be messy. But it's so yummy that even if you did get it all over your face, it's worth it. 
Also, it's really inexpensive. Most def worth a try."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! I put it in my top 5 in the city. The food is fantastic! Best tacos in the city hands down."}
{"text":"People go back and forth between comparing Grand Electric and La Carnita - it's no surprise. The two offer pretty much the same concept. But you will have two entirely different experiences. 

- Food: Grand Electric has food that is slightly more sophisticated, but they way they've been going downhill lately, La Carnita isn't far of the mark. 
-Service: When you compare, la carnita isn't as good as Grand Electric, but when you don't compare, it's just good enough. 
- Size: It's a big restaurant with enough seating. You don't have to wait in line at 6pm for a 2 hour wait. Let's get serious, it's a taco at the end of the day. The size at la carnita makes it a place you can hang out with your friends, drink, snack and laugh. Grand electric does not. The music is intentionally loud in both places to get you to leave sooner rather than later, but somehow, la carnita just has a better more hang out vibe. 
- Drinks: La Carnita doesn't have nearly the drink menu grand electric does, but your wallet will thankyou at the end of the night. 
- Cost: La Carnita won't set you back as much as grand electric, but it's cheap food at the end of the day in both places.

Overall:
Go to la carnita for an easy night, don't expect gourmet food that will blow your mind, but expect good flavour at a good price and a nice buzz...oh and go with a good group of friends. This isn't so much a date place as it is a hang place."}
{"text":"I'm glad to see their success and that they've added this location. It's a lot quieter than the College location and i personally like that. 

But food-wise, i still think the same as i do about their other location - they're decent but not close to excellent."}
{"text":"Girl, if you love cultural appropriation then you will love La Carnita. I sat down to eat and then looked at the menu. The dishes looked like a weird fusion of Mexican food and white people privilege. The drink menu consisted of terrible hip hop puns and it was just upsetting, TBH spend your money on local family-owned Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"I have to echo a previous commenter down below. Yes the food is good but seriously the service or lack there of is BRUTAL. I've been to the College St location which is WAY busier and I've always been treated with respect and courtesy, even while waiting 1 hour to 1 hour and a half. 

I've been twice to this location and the service was poor both times, from the uber unfriendly bartender to the hostess that said a pathetic \"bye\" when we walked out but didn't even look up from her cellphone during the entire thing (seriously, I actually laughed because I felt like it's something I would see in a movie). 

Also, my friend wanted to do remove something from his taco and the waitress said \"No substitutions\" and we were surprised because it's been accommodated at the other location, so I'm not sure the rules there but yeah that kinda sucked also."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for the food.  Taste great but not for $30 lunches with a drink and tax tips.  Would go next door to kinton ramen or something"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is great. However the service is mediocre. Try the beef cheek tacos! They're so good!"}
{"text":"Kind of expensive for the amount of food you get. Tacos are interesting looking with some variety, but really not that good. And the music was sooo loud! Nobody on our table could listen to the other person without yelling, and neither could the waiters hear you. Is it a bar or a restaurant? Anyway, patio looked cool though. Not coming back to this location, at least."}
{"text":"I always end up going to La Carnita when I'm craving tacos. They're not the most authentic but they always hit the spot! They have a couple locations around the city but this one is conveniently located right downtown. They've got some creative tacos and the street corn is so delicious. Every time I get the guacamole I leave wishing I could take a tub home with me. The one complaint I have is that I wish there were more veggie options, but the Crispy Cotija is delicious. Also make sure you leave room for dessert for the chocolate peanut butter paleta (from Sweet Jesus)."}
{"text":"The best Tacos I've had so far. 
They just melt in your mouth and are sooo tasty, I only wish they were cheaper but they're worth the money"}
{"text":"Walked into the restaurant and the place is small but super cute with a light up sign at the back. It's a nice place to hang out and have dinner with friends from the look of it. The food however isn't anything special. I've had better tacos the main things on the menu, at  taco bell. that the comparison, it's a more hipster hangout taco bell. if you think taco bell is the best place on earth then this is the place for you, but if you enjoy real food, don't eat here."}
{"text":"Had a great dining experience here. I have come here twice with a very large group (15-20) and each time we were served promptly and the food and atmosphere were great. I would personally recommend the carnita taco which is very stuffed full of meat and the Mexican corn which is very well seasoned. Prices are fair about 4-5 per taco."}
{"text":"Went to La Carnita on a Thursday night at 6pm, had to wait an hour which wasn't too bad. The atmosphere is great as it's very small but always packed, which is a good thing. Our waiter was very friendly and was joking around with us. We all ordered two dishes each, my favourite was the chicken taco, perfect amount of spice. The margaritas are pretty good. A lot of people complained about music but I think it just adds to the hustle and bustle of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow. Just freaking wow..... mango avocado salad, house made lager and pork shoulder tacos."}
{"text":"Cod tacos were not good. The fried fish was cold smelly and soggy texture. Portions were pretentious. Nice ambiance which gives it the 2 star rating"}
{"text":"The very strange thing about this place is that they don't do separate bills, so technically its not a good place if you are going as a group, also keep in mind that its not possible to take leftovers home which considering their food type it makes sense."}
{"text":"I was first attracted to La Carnita when I was researching about unique frozen treats in Toronto and came across Frozen Bogins. The creator serves her signature paletas (frozen popsicles made from real fruits and other creamy variations) at this particular restaurant, and I was highly anticipating to try :D

I came here on a late Sunday night. It was a full house, had to wait a bit and got seated at the bar. Ordered 2 margaritas and they were delicious. The Mexican street corn was very flavourful (a bit messy but you must order lol). Rice & corn frituras were spicy but I loveeeee rice balls lol. And I thought the pork confit tacos really stood out compared to the popular cod tacos.

As for dessert, I had to order paletas... and then I saw churros, and I had to order that too :D! The cookies & cream paleta was very creamy and it had a whole oreo in there! The key lime pie paleta was quite tart for me, but I know a lot people would love that. The flavours change all the time... I do want to come back to try more hehe :3 Churros, on the other side, was quite chewy. I enjoyed the ones I had in Mexico early this year (they were much softer).

I would definitely come back for drinks and the tapas :) Service is A+... very efficient and attentive. La Carnita also had a warm, moody and welcoming environment... makes you just want to kick back your heels and wind down for a great night out!"}
{"text":"BEST TACOS in Toronto! I have been going to La Carnita since day one and cant tell you the amount of times we have ate here and enjoyed it every time.  prefer the college location but the Queen St one is just as good.
the staff is great- sit at the bar and the guys will take great care of you if you cant get a table. Cocktails are fresh and well balanced. Go for the Margarita.
You need to start off with the corn- its amazing with the spice and cheese. Then move to the meatballs- these are like nothing else you will find in the Toronto taco world.
The in Cod We Trust is my #1 here but try them all and you wont be disappointed. I would recommend about 4 tacos. Don't miss out on desert. 
The place is loud at times but that adds to the vibe."}
{"text":"One vegetarian option (can not be veganized). While it was decent there are not enough options for a non-meat eater. Probably won't return. I found it very dark inside and it felt weird to be there on a nice sunny day."}
{"text":"My friend took my here for my bday on Friday. We sat in the upstairs section , it was hot but the manager was nice enough to open the window for us. The food was delicious! The flavours complimented each other so well. My suggestion is the chicken taco !! And if you love corn you must try theirs!!!"}
{"text":"I like the vibe of La Carnita, but the food fell short for me. The street corn was great, but the tacos were just a little boring. The highlight for me was the music selection and buying a 40 oz of Olde English for the table. I'd come back for cocktails and some apps, but there are definitely some better taco options around the city."}
{"text":"VIBE 
It's crazy packed (aka even if you make a \"reservation\" you'll still wait at least a half hour....this is the price of going here on a Saturday night and surprisingly in January). The staff made it up to us though. It's also still incredibly loud. Great for a group but there are definitely campers here so that's why you're going to wait. Still...overall good vibe.

WE DRANK/ATE 
$13.95 for a margartia is incredibly overpriced but damn! That's a good margarita! 
We had a few tacos too - the arctic char tostada was incredible. Like wow. I kind of want to run back there just to have it again! Beef cheek was great too. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
With their new brunch menu, this place isn't going anywhere soon. Note: they really are reinventing brunch here! Excited to see that but am going to wait until the crowds calm down if that's ever possible."}
{"text":"Great place to grab som quick bites and drinks. Came early in the evening with a large group on a weeknight, and watched the place fill up quickly after 6pm. We tried the guac and chips, variety of tacos, and churros. Tacos are street-sized, but deceptively filling. Guac and chips were decent, as were the churros.

I had an issue with the lighting though; it was very dim, which made it a bit difficult to tell the tacos apart since everything comes together on platters."}
{"text":"Heart about this restaurant and wanna try it out today.
Came at 7 and and met a server with a unwelcome face. Still lot of tables but they said was booked.
Ok!! Had my name down on the wait list and wait  one and half hour and never received anything???
Wtf is wrong with this restaurant???
Never recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"3.5 sweet stars reflect the overall cool appeal of this place and my appreciation for Andrew's philosophy behind this restaurant.

However, the center piece of their menu: the food is not yet 4 stars yet but is inching there. And that's mainly because of the tacos. I just can't get past the overwhelming blandness and dryness of the shells. Their chalky texture stood out in sorry contrast to the delicious flavors of the pollo and the chorizo.  Accompanying salsa would be a good relief.

The absentia condiments rack was also a bit of a let down. I would've like pickled jalapenos with my tacos but unfortunately had to settle for their manufactured sweet/sour sauce, which we had to ask for. Perhaps a bottle of the sauce on each table would've been nicer, since a a rack of bottles was in plain sight at the servers' station.

The tortilla chips are a standout! I loved all three of the dips: the guacamole was chunky and refreshingly limey, the pate was our-father-in-heaven-divine as was the sikil pac mezcal (ground pumpkin seeds with herbs). The chips were our constant friends throughout our time here, so the portions are substantial!

The churros were  piping hot, crunchy, and the right amounts of sweet and salty. The cajeta was a sophisticated caramel and a better marriage between churros and cajeta is rare!

Their tequila is solid and definitely to be savored. However, it was such a muggy day that I might have enjoyed some chilled white better.

The service was very good: the servers were friendly, knowledgeable and good with recommendations and with taking our feedback.

The art work they gave out with their checks was fantastically grotesque!

We stayed for a quite a whiles after reflecting on how gourmand our Mexican experiences have become post university booze fueled spring breaks! +1 for the music not interfering with our happy reminiscing!

I was happy that they didn't throw us out even though the place was busy. My happiness means that I am gonna be going to La Carnita again and again and again!

p.s: Andrew there's quite the typo on the restaurant website. Do you really want to 'sext' patrons when their table is ready? Hahaha, I think not!"}
{"text":"Drinks--to be honest kind of awful. You would think for a taco place the margaritas would be spot on. Instead they tasted like lime juice with a spritzer of tequila. Each pitcher was also $60! Not. Worth. It. Sangria pitcher---tasted like juice. So disappointing. 

Food-- we got the 3 dip appetizer. Overall pretty good. Chips flavored well and of the dips the corn salsa was the best. Tacos were overall pretty solid (only wish they would come out hot!) would recommend the pollo and the fish.

Dessert- pretty flipping awesome churros and good ice cream Popsicles. Def the best part of the meal. 

Service-- decent. But did not fix the drinks as we had asked unfortunately. Waiter overworked and had too many tables. 

Ambiance-- fun but hot as heck (probably more a product of the 100 degree weather than the actual restaurant but still). 

Overall---drinks GOD AWFUL.  Food is decently tasty but still won't be back unless it's for desserts only. Overpriced for the experience."}
{"text":"I love everything on the menu here. Make sure you try the corn, it's amazing. The dessert menu is also quite on point - the dulce de leche cake is always out of this world, as are any of the paletas (get the key lime pie)!"}
{"text":"The steak taco is amazing as are the churros - definitely order both. As well, the chip and salsa/guacamole was expensive for the portion. A friend of mine got the ice cream (I think it was the nut one) tasted like fish for some reason. Still a great time and will 100% go back. The environment and the staff was great and they were super friendly even though I came with a large group!"}
{"text":"Finally made it here at the beginning of the summer.
Expect a line up.
The place lived up to the hype.
The Nachos amazing the guacamole and bean dip awesome.
Drinks fabulous 
Can't wait to try their specialty corn
My only reservation is that if you want someplace quiet or are looking for a place for date night...it does get really loud."}
{"text":"Service was 8/10, food 8/10, ambience also fun and lively. So why the 3 stars?

As someone who has celiac disease, I find it utterly offensive telling people something is \"gluten free\" until you find out that it's celiac or an allergy then it's back pedalling to \"oh, well, it isn't celiac friendly because it's fried in the same fryer with items with gluten\". Gluten-free is GLUTEN-FREE to all you restaurants who do this. I have a hard time believing that you'd tell someone that something is nut or peanut free then back pedal when confronted with a nut allergy. Afford that same courtesy towards those who can't eat gluten. You may not need to see me off in an ambulance as a result of your misinformation, but there is still significant damage. I am glad that my server knew well enough to point it out then confirm with the kitchen. If it was someone less knowledgeable, they wouldn't have know the fryers were cross-contaminated. That said, anyone who's gluten free, there are three items on the menu that you can eat and they are all tacos. 

The tacos themselves are very tasty with the exception of the fact that they tortillas are cold and a little on the hard side. We had the beef cheek, carnitas and the Tostada de ceviche (with soft shell instead of hard). 

I won't be back because of the lack of selection for me. I can go to el Cabalito or Valdez for a lively Friday night taco/South American treat and have bigger selection. But those of you who don't have my gluten issues likely won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, server forgot to punch in our drinks, gave us alcoholic drinks without alcohol and not personable. They also purposely give you one bill so that the POS system generates gratuity.  Not coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Gourmet tacos bursting with flavour - a must-eat.

Our party of six was so impressed with La Carnita this weekend! My family was visiting form out-of-town and having eaten at the location on College, my husband and I knew my parents would love this place! And they did. Before catching a matinee show down the street, we arrived at La Carnita and were greeted by friendly staff right away. We let the server know that one of our family members had dietary restrictions (vegan) and our waitress didn't miss a beat. She listed a few of the different options and was very accommodating and flexible with our request. Our vegan family member went with the Crispy Cotija without cheese and absolutely raved about it! The rest of the family dug into the meatier options and were floored by the flavour profile of many of the tacos - including Carnita, Beef Cheek, Tostada de Ceviche - and my personal favourite, the Saturday Special which was Pork Belly. Overall, we were so happy with our experience - the food and staff made this a very memorable spot that we'll definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"We came here for dins around 6:30pm on Halloween night and was surprised to see how empty it was. Is everyone out treat-or-treating? 

Despite an empty resto, we enjoyed our dinner very much. The food was delicious! So full of flavours that just exploded in our mouths.  In certain cases it was literally an explosion with the jalapeño peppers. Watch out for those bad boys.  We ordered the famous \"must have\" corn, beef cheeks and cod tacos, mushroom empanada and mango avo salad.  I absolutely lovvvve the salad specially the crispy chips that complimented the texture of the salad so well. I wish I could see what type of chips it was but unfortunately, it was super dark inside the resto. That's probably my only one complaint, some more lighting would be good. Other than that, I thought the service was good and price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Late lunch and ordered the pre fixe option. Two tacos, one corn and one small paleta for $16.95. Still pretty pricey & the tortillas were tough and not fresh like I remembered them to be. It was 3pm and the place was pretty busy. Felt like they were trying to push the purchase of an alcoholic drink a bit too hard and felt tempted to show them my 8 month preggers belly. Prices are significantly higher than I remember too - $6 per taco and $10 for the corn appetizer,  which is not enough to feel full - for me anyway. :)"}
{"text":"I have been having a pretty weird week. The weather is getting nicer in Toronto and yet I have been feeling blah. I tried to get out of meeting up with friends for dinner tonight because my bed was calling to me. Plus I was behind one episode of Masterchef UK and I knew that John Torode would put a smile on my face. Oh yeah, I have a massive crush on that handsome Aussie. For those of you who do not watch Masterchef UK (shame on you!!!), he is one of the hosts.  But alas my friends talked me into going out tonight. I whined and complained but eventually I gave in. And you know what made getting out of bed worthwhile? CORN!

But wait! There is more! I also ordered their coffee and it came with condensed milk for $2.50. Oh you read that right, condensed milk! I must have looked quite enamored with the condensed milk because the waitress gave me a second cup of coffee with more condensed milk after I finished the first cup on the house. Maybe that is why I am not sleepy. Caffeine + SUGAR = feeling wired.

Let's not forget our actual dinner. We ordered tacos. Wow, these were the best tacos I have ever had, and I am hard to please. They were small, but packed with flavor and fresh ingredients. We ordered three types of tacos,  In Cod We Trust made with voltron sauce, lime crema, pickled red cabbage, green apple & cilantro, Pollo Frito made with peanut mole sauce, pickled green cabbage & salsa fresca and Chorizo made with mango salsa, pickled onion, queso cotija and cilantro. They were each $4.50.

My friends ordered the \"tres leches\" for dessert for $6. This is not like any tres leches I have ever had, and I eat tres leches often. But my friends enjoyed it.

And I ordered a peanut butter paleta for $4, though I would have liked it better without the peanuts. It was tasty nonetheless.

So there you have it. I bailed on John for this. And it was so worth it! Though it would have been an even better evening if we had not been rushed out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Last night I went and was seated within 3 minutes of entering.  I'd never been seated that fast at La Carnita and I have to admit the long waits for tables were the only thing i'd ever considered to be a negative at this fantastic restaurant.  

We had a grilled shrimp with BBQ Chipotle sauce, served with purple potato chips and grilled pineapple.  The combination of smoky, sweet, tangy, crunchy and savory was impeccable.

We followed these with a few tacos: the Ceviche, the Chorizo, the Carnita, the Dill Pickerel.  All delicious, different and bursting with incredible flavors.

To wash it all down, we had a bourbon cocktail the Who Shot Ya and the Now is the Thyme; a Jameson and Tequila concoction with  egg whites and lemon.  The latter was my favorite this time around.

The only reason I'm not giving this review 4/5 is directly related to two instances.  One has to do with asking for cutlery from a nearby employee who happened to be a hostess and the blatant miscalculation of restrooms to capacity ratio.

After asking for cutlery, the hostess smiled and went to fetch them. She returned with one knife and two forks.  As a pair of buds having dinner, we were a little shocked and confused at the idea of sharing a knife.  What's more, she didn't place them on our table.  Instead, she tossed them onto our table as she passed by.

Later on in the evening after a few libations, I joined a queue of six other people in a crowded low ceiling hallway in the basement.  We all waited in anticipation to use the three communal washrooms.
I'm fairly certain there were close to one hundred patrons during my time at La Carnita; I fail to understand the formula which yielded a ratio of three washrooms for about one hundred patrons.
The total time spent away from the table :18 minutes.
Thats about 11 minutes too long in my books.  Had I been on a date; I think she might not have appreciated such an extended absence from the table."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night at around 8. Didn't have to wait for a table, got seated right away and our orders taken in 5. Sunday's special was the barbecao ribs which we decided to order; so glad we did because it was delicious! The meat was tender, fell off the bone and well sauced up. The hickory sticks with each bite made for a good one! Order it.

Had the Mexican street corn which was pretty good. Definitely worth a try. 

Tacos - in cod we trust (pretty good) / beef cheek (the best one we had) and the carnita (pork which I thought would be the best but tasted blah). 

We got the ribs and corn first in like 10min (pretty fast service). After we finished we got the tacos like 5-10min after. I am amazed by the fast service we received and the staff was great. We were in and out in under 40 minutes. 

Bill came up to around $40 without tip -- a very good meal that's for sure. Definitely was expecting to shell out more cash than that. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This location is not as good as the one downtown. The tacos weren't as warm (especially the beef). They range around 5-7$ depending. My friends REALLY like the tostadas though, so get that! I enjoyed the Carnita with all those mango bits... Mmmm!

We got the avocado dip for $8 and it was so little! They could have at least filled the bowl! Oh well, maybe that's why they want you to get the three dips. 

Overall they have a patio so that's dope. Love the staff. Thanks for the girl who took our pics haha"}
{"text":"Nice decor and convenient location - but La Carnita for me just doesn't compare to some of the other taco places in Toronto.

That being said, the ribs (available on Sundays) were decent although slightly drier than I would've liked. I also had the chorizo and the fish tacos both of which were good.

Overall, La Carnita is a good spot for a casual dinner with friends. But if you're craving tacos and don't require seating for multiple people, head over to Kensington instead."}
{"text":"Overall I'm quite the fan of this place and will definitely be back. 

We were 4 people for dinner, which consisted of a pretty decent of appetizers and tacos. 

And as a warning, the tacos/tostadas aren't that big.  Lots of filling but you'll need 2-3 per person, probably with an appetizer or two to make a decent meal.  That means that this is not a cheap taqueria, but the food is good. 

Appetizers:

Tortilla chips with 3 dips (guacamole, corn salsa and spicy bean dip). We all agreed the corn salsa was the best of these. It was quite refreshing and tasty. Guacamole was good but not exceptional. Bean dip was also good (and not really spicy - nothing here was particularly spicy). 

Ancho chicken wings:   Wings were quite large and pretty good overall. Not super-interesting and not much in the way of spiciness. Worth having if you like wings but not a standout. 

Mexican street corn:  done well, tasty and worth getting again

Mango salad: mixed reviews on this. One of us said they would not get it again and a couple of us really liked it.

Tacos/tostadas:

Mushroom - mushrooms and other toppings were good but there was too much sauce which kind of overwhelmed the rest of the flavours

Cauliflower - good, tasty and well slanted

Pollo frito. - very much liked

Fried cod - good balance of flavours and tasty

Ceviche - yummy and don't let the habaneros intimidate you.  Not much spice

Booze (they don't pour lightly here):

House margarita - really good. 

Sangria - good and refreshing. 

Dessert - churros - definitely one of the better churros I've had in Toronto. 

So overall - worth going to but not super-cheap."}
{"text":"This is a really fun place to go! The food is relatively cheap and very delicious. Loved the beef cheek tacos and thought the sangria and margaritas were both fantastic. Make sure you order guacamole to share! 
The place is lively with awesome music but could make it difficult to have serious conversations so if you want a quiet place.. Perhaps this is not for you. 
Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to eat at this place. We had the Cod taco and the pollo fritti tacos.. soo delicious. Love the casual atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Cod tacos I've ever had, just the right amount of crispiness, lightness, saltiness, acidity and vegetables. Also must tries are the ceviche (they get the lime acidity perfectly in my opinion) and also the charred corn with spices and crema sauce (was it goat cheese or creme fraiche? I'm not sure). Finally the only thing I disliked were the house chips which I found were too salty and greasy, but I guess that's how many people like it. Would highly recommend it anyone who enjoys unpretentious, delicious food in a trendy environment."}
{"text":"C'est très occupé, bel endroit avec une belle déco. C'est plutôt grand. La bouffe est vraiment une approche nouvelle sur la cuisine mexicaine. Ce n'est pas authentique mais les techniques sont clairement respectées. J'ai détesté le côté bruyant. Semble-t-il que c'est très typique dans les restaurants du centre-ville de Toronto d'avoir une sono vraiment maxé. Ça brise l'expérience car on doit crier pour parlé à quelqu'un en face de soi.  C'est un peu dispendieux pour de la bouffe mexicaine. L'approche est aussi pas vraiment mexicaine; Par exemple on achète des tacos en entrée et c'est 2 tacos pour 6-7$. C'est plus un tapas bar. 

Néanmoins très bon!"}
{"text":"Only go to this location if you have a few hours to kill. Tried sitting down here for lunch twice, each time after 50 minutes of waiting no food was brought out. When asked where our food was the waiters said they will check with the kitchen, only to turn around and either walk over to the next table or to go on with their business.

Downtown location had much better service and haste."}
{"text":"Came here on a week night and they were super busy. Had to be on a wait list and waited around 20-30 mins, but have heard good things and wanted to give it a try regardless! 

Ended up sitting at a bar, but the bartender was friendly and helpful. They have a small selection of tacos, and I ended up ordering all of them to try it out. Food was so delicious! All of them were good, but the one that stood out to me were the fish tacos! Have to go back again sometime. Was super stuffed by the end; I can't even remember how many tacos were ordered...

I would say it was competively priced given the quality of the food, definitely a place worth trying out!"}
{"text":"Hombre, the tacos here are seriously overrated. They're soggy, lacking flavour and just generally weak. Not to mention that there are a boatload of other solid taco spots within walking distance. 

Save yourself the disappointment and go to Seven Lives instead."}
{"text":"amazing tacos!!! my friends and i went here for a girls night out. there were 6 of us and we got 4 pitchers of sangria (2 red & 2 white) and 5 tacos + churros. they all came pretty fast. the sangria was delicious...i normally prefer red but this time the white tasted better - a bit sweeter but can still taste the alcohol. the churros came in 3 and were fresh. they were served in a cup filled 1/3 with caramel. we got the grilled fish taco, the ceviche x 2, fried fish, and the beef. i didn't taste the beef or the fried fish tacos but the ones i tried were so good! the grilled fish was grilled to perfection...it was flaky and moist and the skin was crisp. the ceviche tasted fresh and there was tons of guac!"}
{"text":"Fake Mexican food for hipsters who think pulled pork is exotic. We went there ordered a number of tacos and while we were waiting they put on some terrible Lil Wayne album at full volume. Not really Mexican food music , but whatever... i didn't mind the cursing I didn't mind Lil Wayne's garbage rap style aimed at 12 yearolds, BUT IT WAS SOOOOO RIDICULOUSLY LOUD I HAD TO YELL AT MY DATE! So I asked the waitress if she could turn it down. She had to scream\"PEOPLE HERE LIKE THIS LOUD!\"  so I left before the food came."}
{"text":"This is not a restaurant. Its more of a bar with tapas (small sampler dishes).  Don't come here for a meal or to fill your belly. The taco portions are really small.

Also, they post pictures on Instagram of all these cool dishes but they are not regular menu items. So if you go there hoping to get something that you saw on Instagram, its really weird, they may not have it in. Like I was there any posted this tasty looking empanada, and when I asked for it, they didn't have it in.  Nor was it on the menu?  Why tempt us with pics of food items that we can't bet on having if we come? Plus they have multiple locations, so how do I know which has it in?

The prices really add up; $51.00 for 2 appetizers, two little single soft tacos, three desserts and two sodas.  

If youre looking for a place to hang, (and not a meal) and basic bar ambience, this is the place.

They play house and hip hop. Now I understand why the person wrote in the tips that you should bring something to stuff your ears. The house music was a little annoying and jarring. 

The corn on the cob was tasty, the fritters were okay, and the tacos was good (though mini portion), and the desserts were super cool.

*** Come here just for the SweetJesus popsicles!!!

Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Food is decent, not too much selection but man....  It's expensive. I thought the price was for 2 tacos. I knew what I was getting into when ordering don't get me wrong but being from San Diego where awesome tacos can be 1 to 2 dollars... 

Yeah I miss the tacos in San Diego. Not sure if I would go again. Also not sure if it's fair to compare that way but it's hard having cheap and tasty Mexican food in my past."}
{"text":"4/5 for the cute decor.
2/5 for the table I sat at across from the bar. I hate eating at super tall tables. It is awkward. Next time I will request a table in the back.
5/5 for the old school hip hop playing.
5/5 for the server who was attentive.
4/5 for the reasonable price point on the food.
3/5 for the food I had. We had the chips and guacamole. They were pretty meh. I tried the Sunday special - a fried chicken sandwich. It tasted like General Tao chicken on a kinda stale bun. I am really sorry I didn't order a taco. 

Shit I noted. Their Chelada wasn't spicy. I wouldn't bother with it again. Secondly, they had like five thousand people working there and they are all very young. I felt like a senior, but that's okay. Finally, listening to ODB makes every meal better."}
{"text":"Checked out La Carnita for an early dinner before a movie at the Scotiabank Theatre.

Even though there were plenty of tables, they sat us a communal table of 6 for just two of us.  There were 2 people already at the table when we arrived.

We ordered the tortilla chips with guac to start ($8), followed by two tacos each.  I got the cod ($4.50) and the beef cheek ($5.50).  No boozy drinks tonight because we had to stay awake for the movie.

Chips and guac were pretty standard...I liked that that the chips were lightly dusted with a spice.  Cod taco was decent but the toppings were just way too sour and tart for my liking.  Beef cheek taco was much better and flavourful.

Finished off with an order of the churros ($6) - 3 warm deep fried dough sticks with a nice carmel dipping sauce.

Service was good from our cute Shawn Ashmore-lookalike waiter.  Music was a touch unnecessarily loud for that early in the day, which let us concentrate on the food rather than conversation.

A decent dinner option if you're looking to get away from the chain restaurants like Milestones and Jack Astors in the area."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and attentive service. Knowledgable bartenders. Fresh food and great cocktails. Paletas change on a regular basis. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Delicious and innovative. But overpriced really. Service is bad. My waitress HAD an attitude. And it was LOUD. Don't expect to have any conversation."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying the food was excellent. We had the tacos with the chicken, the steak, chorizo and ceviche and they were all delicious. The ceviche one was especially good. 

Why the 2 stars? The service was absolutely garbage. Even though it was St Patrick's day, the place really wasn't that busy. It took forever for the server to come over and take our drink order. We gave our food order at the same time since we were afraid he wouldn't come back anytime soon.

The food came pretty fast but the server never once checked on us. When we asked for the bill he said okay and then was nowhere to be found. We sat there for a good 20 minutes before I flagged down another server.

I think I'd rather go somewhere else for my fancy tacos from now on"}
{"text":"Waiting at the Bar for a spot on the patio to open up. This wasn't bad except the bartender did a hard up sell, on what ended up being the most expensive mix drink (if it was on the menu).

Seats opened on the patio and had to manage my way through the sea of people waiting for Sweet Jesus ice cream.

In total we (table for two) were there for approx. 1 hr, in which time we only saw our actual server 4 times.
1: Appetizer: Corn on the cob. Which was very good. 
2: Main course: Four different Taco's. Pretty good but nothing special.
3: Another Drink: Flying Monkey Beer.
4: Dessert: Would have order something, but wasn't interested in waiting another 25 mins for a Cookies and Cream Popsicle.

Paid with another server that came out to start helping.
Even saw the bartender from inside that served our first drinks bring out drink orders.

This is place is probably good but they are short staffed and the girl working the patio didn't care to speed anything up.

Won't be back.

Goodbye,

Ty"}
{"text":"This place is another La Carnita (a Mexican taco restaurant) that opened in Toronto. The location is connected to Sweet Jesus, since they are owned by  the same company.

I came here for lunch on a Thursday. This place looks very new and has a nice patio outside for customers to dine too. The inside decor was dark, hipster and really cool (the website describes it as gringo twist) I loved the tables and the entire layout! 

The service is very friendly, from the hostess to the waiter. I ordered the Thursday special which was the chicken fried steak taco and the ceviche taco. They both tasted pretty good, but I definitely preferred the ceviche better. The steak taco was served warm and not hot and fresh. For dessert, they serve some items from Sweet Jesus, including their paleta. 

The only downside of this place is, you can't get take out and the portions of the tacos are expensive for their size. One taco is at least $5+. 

I would still come back to try their other daily specials despite this since their daily specials are unique and you can't get it any other day."}
{"text":"Great little reclaimed historic building on John st south of Adelaide - it wants to be Mexican themed food but doesn't bill itself as authentic.  So don't hit here thinking you will get world class and accurate Mexican spiced dishes.  Still the food is flavourful and fun and is paired up with great drinks and margaritas. can you make a margarita with less than two ounces of tequila?? I think there is a law that says you can't and that makes me happy.

Service was quick and attentive and friendly.  There are an upstairs and downstairs so check out both sections for more comfortable seating.

They are co businesses with sweet Jesus the ice cream place so go get a fancy burrito and a ridiculously gourmet ice cream and then wash it all down with some Cuervo. 

Pretty good day."}
{"text":"Came here on Tuesday night around 10:00 pm, the place was moderately busy but the ambience is still very intimate.  We came in a group of 4 including my 2 girl friends and my gay best friend. We ordered the Tuesday taco special which had a good amount of heat on their braised chicken but a nice balance with the cool sauce and avocado. You can tell the place is well thought out and I really appreciated their service. Based on our receipt, our waiter \"Downstairs knight\" -- (whether that his real name or not, Ill never know)  offered us amazing warm service. He went as far as offering a small glass ginger ale to one of my friends as she stated her tummy was feeling a little upset.

However, the REAL  attraction to this place has to be the attractive men! We were seated at a with a view of the open kitchen, in sight of all the hot cook(s) and bartenders.  Hot tacos for the hot guys"}
{"text":"At first, I was really excited when I heard they opened a new location for La Carnita thats not in downtown. The location was perfect because it's a lot closer to where I live.
Seeing all the low reviews made me feel skeptical about this place, but after having lunch here I get what people are saying about the poor service.

I was slightly shocked at first when I saw the menu because it seems like they increased the price. Not sure if it's just this new location, or the price increase is standard at all locations but from what I recall the tacos were never that expensive.

I ordered the Lunch Prix Fixe ($15.99).
The Prix Fixe comes with 1 appetizer, any 2 tacos of your choice, and 1 dessert. For the appetizer, your option is essentially just the chips & one dip. You can choose to have the street corn but you have to add an extra $1 (This I think was a bit of a rip off). As for tacos, the daily special tacos can't be included. First of all, they should have noted that on the menu, and second of all I don't get why since the Carne Asada (Beef steak taco) which was one of the choices cost more than the daily special taco. Anyways, I ordered the Carne Asada taco, and the In Cod We Trust taco. The beef steak taco was actually really good, the meat was really tender and not tough at all. Flavors went well. The cod fish taco was good too, my only complaint was they added a bit too much radish. For dessert you can choose either churros or a paleta. I had the Cookie Monster paleta which was delicious. Essentially its an oreo cookie in the center, wrapped with ice cream and dunked into oreo crumbs all on the outside.

Soft Shell Crab Tacos ($6.50 each)
They had me at soft shell crab. This was really tasty. The vegetables on top were a little too spicy, but I like how they served a decent size of the soft shell crab meat and it wasn't buried in batter. 

Strictly based on food I would have given this restaurant 4 star, as I've always been a fan of their food. But after factoring in the service i deducted a star. When we sat down and the waitress gave us the menus, she didn't introduce the daily special taco, I had to ask on her what it was, and she didn't even know the price. That wasn't what really bugged me the most. What really bothered me was a waiter came and served the paleta, the dessert from my prix Fixe before I even got my main. ???? Sure fine they made a mistake and apologized. But while I was eating my tacos, the waitress comes back and says are you ready for your dessert? ..... Hmm? Seriously? I'm still eating my main. So I told her no, i want to finish my main course first. Not sure why they were rushing me to take back my dessert. But I think it's because they already plated and served it, they can't put it back in the fridge so it was just sitting outside waiting to melt. When I got my paleta the ice cream part was super soft and melting, so I believe my assumption was true.

I really don't get it. The food is good, but the service is just not the greatest. Couldn't they have hired better staff, or at least train them better? Then for sure I think guests would enjoy their experience here a lot more. The atmosphere and decorates were nice, but I think I still prefer going to the downtown locations."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my co-workers and ordered the lunch prix fixe menu ($16.99+tax) which includes the following:
- Appetizer: Mexican Street Corn or Tortilla Chips with Dip (Guacamole, Corn Salsa, or Spicy Bean and Smoked Queso)
- Main: Any two tacos 
- Dessert: Churro or Paleta (Key Lime Pie, Chocolate Peanut Butter, or Cookie Monster flavour)

I ordered:
- Tortilla Chips with Corn Salsa Dip: The chips were great, toasted to perfection with flavouring that was not too salty. Corn Salsa was so-so, tried the Spicy Bean and Smoked Queso dip and preferred that 
- \"In Cod We Trust\" Taco: So yummy! A generous piece of cod that melted in your mouth and the cilantro really added flavour
- Daily Feature (Tuesday) Taco: Tasted great, served on a tostada (hard taco) with shiitake mushrooms, cheese, herbs and chilli sprinkled on top
- Churro: AMAZING!!! Absolutely delicious, covered in sugary goodness and served with dulce de leche sauce 

We went just before noon and beat the lunch rush, but service was still a bit slow. As others have mentioned, the music is quite loud so I would only recommend if you're looking for a casual atmosphere. 

I'll definitely be back for the tacos and of course, those amazing churros!!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Monday night and place was busy. Service was fantastic. Everything we ate was delicious. Very affordable, tacos about 5 bucks each, appys anywhere from 5-12. Some of the best wings I've ever had (extremely spicy if you can handle them)   only negative is seating is tight and not very comfortable. And it can get a bit loud."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Kind of difficult to spot, they could work on better signage but the door was amazing. 
I recommend the meatball appetizer (my friend loves the corn) and the chicken taco + the calamari were really good 

Staff is really sweet, and their recommendations are great"}
{"text":"Great tacos, chorizo one is my favorite. But the In Cod We Trust and the crispy avocado is wonderful too."}
{"text":"Ive been here about four times and my friends and I (total 6 people) waited about an hr each time to be seated. Despite this minor setback their food is amazing. The guacamole and nachos are okay and to be honest I would skip it next time so I could have filled my belly with their more delicious menu items. Ive tried every single taco and I would say the beef cheek taco is by far my favourite. Their avocado and mango salad is also delicious. As everyone else already mentioned their churros with the chocolate sauce is amazing but I have to say their chocolate fudge popsicle was out of this world. Ive come on fridays and saturdays and both nights are super packed and super loud so if you're planning on coming here for a romantic date night so you can talk and be cute DONT lol. I feel like anyone would enjoy this place if they came with a group of 3 or more. I do get somewhat of a hipster vibe but im not complaining because their food is amazeballs."}
{"text":"The food is great here. The service, not so much. We put our name down for a table and they told us to go get a drink somewhere while waiting their call (estimated 45 minute wait). After 25 minutes, we got the call that our table was ready. We arrived, and our \"table for four\" had become a \"table for two\". We proceeded to wait an extra 25 minutes for \"the next table\" (though many tables of four were sat before us.  The hostesses were less than pleasant about the inconvenience. 


Enjoy the food. Don't enjoy the service."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best tacos I have ever had. So tasty and delicious. Drinks were great. Vibe and music and ambience were all amazing. Great times!!!"}
{"text":"So I finally got a chance to try out La Carnita and it lived up to the hype that it receives. All those posted IG pics and rave reviews from friends really got me excited to try this place out.

First Impression: I really got a hipster vibe from this place and it was dark, cramped, loud music and people with good fashion sense. I enjoyed the setup as they had a bar right at the front so you could get a drink while you waited

Food Impressions: 
1. Sweet Corn with Spicy Sauce - great starter but was ¼ burnt. Sauce was spicy
2. Tortilla Chips with Gucamole - chips were good with pepper and lime dressing,   gucamole was meh
3. In Cod We trust - Really good size code, overall delicious
4. Beef Cheek - thought it would be better, tasted kind of bland
5. Carnita - My favorite of them all, great flavor overall and has a nice aftertaste.
6. Popsicles - They were all great!

Service Impression: We had 4 people missing from our party and they still gave us the biggest table in the restaurant. They brought over the wrong drink and we were told to just keep it, same thing with one of our taco orders. They brought over a dessert and a candle melted to a wooden board (crafty and creative) for our friend's bday.

Overall Impression: You cannot go to a Mexican place and not get tequila which we did and I believe my experience at La Carnita was great but I don't remember one tequila too many but I will say this, La Carnita not bad *insert impressed meme*"}
{"text":"Meh..... After the long wait to get a table,  not worth it. 
Ambiance was mediocre.  
Service was average with a little too cool attitude. 
Loud loud....  

Way better at Wilbur,  Grand electric or 7 lives."}
{"text":"I've been to several Mexican restaurants throughout Vancouver and Toronto, but La Carnita on John St. is hands down my favourite place to get tacos - especially fish tacos! I've been recommended their sweet corn appetizer every time I dine there but never got them because I thought how good can corn really get? It's amazing. The best sweet corn I'll ever have. I want them everyday. With the In Cod We Trust. 

It's fairly dark during dinner, but it's always a good crowd with vibrant chats and spotlights. The main level is cozy, kind of feels like an upscale college vibe, and upstairs gives a more lounge like vibe with purple and red lights and high ceilings. 

I think we're going there for dinner again tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I've been going to La Carnita for a few years now. A go-to spot when I want a place with good music, cool vibes, and pollo (chicken) tacos that everyone consistently loves. Fantastic hot sauce (this is a big deal to me). I also ALWAYS order dessert.

Solid service. Fast, attentive, detail-oriented but not overbearing. 

I'd go a bit earlier if you want some quiet(er) conversations. I personally like the busy and loud atmosphere. Love the booths in the back room for larger groups and the smaller tables across the kitchen."}
{"text":"Not my favourite place, it had a really nice aesthetic but as a uni student with a large appetite and tight pockets this place doesn't satisfy me. The food was definitely good but it made me wanting more but the servings are small so I would have to spend a lot of money to become satisfied. Nonetheless, it is a nice place."}
{"text":"La Carnita is hands down my favourite Mexican restaurant within the GTA. From their appetizers to their tacos, to their desserts and drinks - I can never get enough of this place. 

Service and Environment:
It's a pretty small restaurant so be expected to sit in a close proximity to other tables. It's a fun, hipster-like and minimal lighting environment with good loud music. Wait time for food is quick and service is spectacular. 

Food
Where do I even begin?? Here is a small breakdown of some of my favourite menu items. 
Starters:
Tortilla Chips with either (or all) Guacamole, Corn Salsa, Spicy Bean and Smoked Queso - a great starter, especially if you're with a group of friends! 
Mexican Street Corn - So so so good if you're a big corn on the cob fan; very flavourful and delicious. 

Tacos!
To be honest I love all of them LOL but my favourite would have to be the \"Carnita\" and \"In cod we trust\". They are very generous with the portions and I find that each taco comes with a lot of meat and toppings. Each taco is around 4-5 dollars and you can buy them individually. 

Desserts!
I am IN LOVE with the desserts that are offered here!! My absolute favourite is the Tres Leche Cake, it's a traditional Mexican sponge cake that is soaked in three different types of milk, giving it a very moist and soft texture. My second favourite dessert menu item are the Paletas, which are basically ice cream popsicles that come in a variety of flavours such as key lime pie, cookies and cream, strawberry shortcake etc. (Flavours change everyday)."}
{"text":"Amazing meatballs and cod taco!!

The mexican meatballs were out of this world. So full of flavor and juicy, cooked perfectly. Highly recommend getting them. The cod taco was also just as amazing. The balance of all the food was incredible."}
{"text":"Came here with two other girl friends of mine. When we came in, we were seated right away and was greeted by our server who was really nice. Everything was going well so far because my friends and I were so excited for tacos, and to catch up with each other since we haven't seen each other in a while.  As we ordered, we have noticed that the music got a little bit more louder (maybe because it was friday?), and as a result, we felt like we had to shout just so we can hear each other, keeping in mind that we were only inches away from one another. The overly dimmed lights also turned us off, and it felt like it was one setting away from feeling like we're about to eat blind folded. Food came surprisingly quick, and exceeded our expectations, we had the street corn (mildly spicy and delicious), Fish tacos ( could be better. too much batter and a little soggy), and the chicken tacos (my fave), for dessert we had paletas which was also great. 

Pros: food was great and served quick

cons: the music was too loud and lights too dimmed 

Over all, I would recommend and come back :)"}
{"text":"Amazing. Simply amazing. The food was DELICIOUS. I basically majored in Mexican food and the creative tacos are savory and fresh. I drank a \"Who got ya?\" and had the Mexican corn, and a bunch of tacos off the menu. The waitress, Chelsea, was super cool and helped us out with everything! The atmosphere was friendly, the prices aren't too bad and the service was awesome. Highly recommend and after your meal, you can go to Sweet Jesus for deserts (they connect in the back).."}
{"text":"We started off with chips and guac which was great. The rib special on Sunday was my favourite choice. The pollo frito taco was delicious. The churros and tres leches put the cherry on top of an overall amazing meal/experience. Can't forget the $25 special on rose sangria!"}
{"text":"Decent prices, delicious food, but super slow service. I love Wilbur and the tacos are comparable but if I had to choose, I'd go with Wilbur for the faster service. 
The corn on the cob is great but not worth the price! They have a hard taco special on tuesday nights that I would definitely go try out."}
{"text":"What a disappointing experience. I won't even bother describing the food because it's not amazing enough to tolerate the overall service. 
We waited over 25 minutes from the time we ordered to get our appetizers. We ordered chips and spicy bean dip, and scallop ceviche..and the chips didn't even come until we were done with the ceviche. Then we waited another 20 minutes for our tacos, while the table that came after us were served their appetizers AND tacos and had finished before we got ours.
It took us flagging two servers down, to find out there was apparently \"a mix up in the kitchen\". I understand mistakes happen, but the fact that they did not rectify this mistake right away and seemed inconvenienced when we asked, just made it worse. 
We had to ask where our food was twice. They did end up sending up a dessert for free, but at that point we were already upset at the whole experience.
The food was okay, but like I said not amazing enough to take away the unpleasantness of our experience."}
{"text":"I came here last Saturday night with my friend, Laura, and lo and behold the window bar seating was empty. She suggested we sit there because inside, it could get quite loud. She has been here before and knew the drill and also just the right amount of food to order so we wouldn't waddle home like that last time we went to County General a block away and we had to dip into a crappy pub for some pints in order to aid digestion just so we could keep moving. It seems counter-intuitive but the only thing that will clear you out quicker than fingers down the throat, is draught beer, a cleansing ale. This is why Vikings rule over Romans.

We ordered 8 different tacos so we could split them and get all the flavours except for the token vegetarian one, duh. They are kind of small but you can easily cut them in half and wold them in two bites. The crispy chicken was the best one, both of us agreed, and the cod one was the most Instagram-worthy aesthetically speaking. I got a new iPhone 6 so I got some of my apps back and took a shot of it with the old Hipstamatic. I don't care what the elders of  Hipsterville say, I still think it takes cool photos. So we ate 4 delicious tacos each in total and had 2 pints and I think we paid $35 each. That's not bad. We were delightfully satiated. If we would have had chips or something, I would have been bummed out eating the last taco because I would have had to have forced it down. Also the service was top-notch. There were at least 3 servers waiting on us, and each of them on the ball and sweet as pie.

One little tiny thing tho: WTF IS UP WITH THE MUSIC AND WHY SO LOUD? Yes, I am a lady of a certain age but I've moshed in mud with no bra. I'm not a delicate flower, but this fucking \"music\" was some genre, I don't know even what, and you're going to say \"It's 90s hip hop, you old daft cow\" and I swear this was NOT 90s hip hop, it was abusive screaming rap narrated by some guy yelling about how his feelings were hurt by some hoe, prolly in the sixth grade, with no tune whatsoever. This is the kind of music nobody actually likes but they say they like because they think they should like it but even the guy who's yelling is filled with self-loathing and wants desperately to shut up but he can't. Obviously the tactic here is to keep the brain-washed hipsters pure and blast out the old people like when the U.S. invaded Panama and bombarded Noriega out of hiding with Van Halen back in 1989. I remember when this happened  because I'm that ancient but don't fucking think your little trick is going to work on me, La Carnita. I'm a tough old bitch and I'll will be back for more tacos. And maybe some dessert next time."}
{"text":"Tacos are good,  but the service is enough to make anyone lose their appetite. I have never experienced such disgusting , rude, offensive service. As someone who has worked many years in the industry all I can say is that if this were my restaurant I would fire everyone of those idiots in crop tops. Every single time I've been in (more than 5) the service seems to get worse. They are now all pooling their tips which means you don't have one sever, you have about 3 or 4 who all seem to have much better things to do than serve you. Good luck trying to get a second round of drinks or ordering any food after your first order. I always feel like I have to beg to be served and as soon as you finish your tacos they will drop off your bill and take your plates without even asking if you're finished. I wish they would just get on uber eats so I didn't have to suffer another night at this dive. 
I also don't appreciate my waiters stomach in my face or someone showing up to work in sweat pants trying to make tips. Maybe that's just me."}
{"text":"Was kept waiting over two hours when told table would be under an hour. App with how many tables ahead of you had us as next table for 45 minutes. Staff was rude, condescending, and unapproachable.
Good took another hour to come and was cold.
Have had good experiences here in the past and generally good food but awful, careless service."}
{"text":"I was going a bit stir crazy from being cooped inside for days, and decided to venture out for dinner before I began to turn feral. The stars must have been aligned for me, as the night I came here they were serving a special vegetarian mushroom taco, so I was able to try not ONE, but TWO taco options (as a vegetarian I generally consider any type of variety a pretty big deal)! I also felt really lucky to have an AMAZING server, who was super friendly and attentive (but not overbearing), great at answering questions and offering suggestions, and made the entire dining experience really fantastic. I also liked the atmosphere here a lot; there's hip-hop music playing, cool artwork everywhere, and the bill came with a print of a skull (very \"Alexander McQueen\"). 

On to the food. The tortilla chips were excellent, and the serving size is rather generous (for about $6.50 a plate), so expect to share. Sikil Pak is a type of \"Mexican hummus\" made with pumpkin seeds, and the guacamole is pretttty darn tasty as well. After plowing through half a plate of chips and dips, I had the crispy avocado and mushroom special tacos, and they were okay, but for $5 a pop, admittedly not that amazing. The meal ended with a Cookies and Cream paleta (a Mexican popsicle) which was SO GOOD -- really creamy and rich with giant chunks of Oreo cookies throughout. It was the perfect end to the meal. 

Overall a meal for two came to around $60 with tax and tip. A little bit pricy for some chips, tacos, and popsicles, and I guess my only gripe about this place is that the menu has limited range and poor value. HOWEVER, I came away from the entire experience feeling really satisfied and happy, and if only for a one-time meal, it was lovely. Will I be back? Not sure, but I would definitely recommend first-timers to give it a go!"}
{"text":"Really really great tacos - ordered the pollo frito and the carnita. LOVED the pollo frito!!! It's fried chicken (which is usually weird for me in tacos) but our waitress recommended it and I'm glad she did because it had so much flavour and texture. The carnita tasted a little bland after the pollo frito but it is spicy! Would order the pollo frito again for sure.

Also had the chorizo meatballs and scallop ceviche as appetizers. Both great options for sharing, but the food itself was not good enough to order again but it was enjoyable. 

For drinks, had the grapefruit/pineapple one (forgot what it was called) which was nice and sweet. Had the cookies and cream ice cream bar, which was good because it wasn't too sweet! And at a decent price."}
{"text":"This place is so good I've been twice this week.  The cod tacos will have me coming back as often as possible.  Just the battered cod alone had me thinking of the fresh fish I'd get in Nova Scotia.   Too delicious for words. A new food craving to add to my brain menu.  And a don't even know where to begin with the sweet corn.  So. Good.   I'm sure I did myself a disservice by not saving room for dessert after seeing other yelpers photos. Next time."}
{"text":"La Carnita serves up great tasting tacos that appeal to majority of Mexican food lovers. Ordered a Cod taco and a special taco (forgot what was in it) and they both tasted great. The corn was flavourful and was exactly what other members have raved about.  

Would have given this restaurant a 4/5 had the prices been cheaper because the tacos are very tiny and the price per taco was $4.75... 

We essentially considered the meal here as appetizers to our main meal down the street."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday during taste of little Italy and was not disappointed. 

The service: really friendly waitress who appeared at all the right times. I also noticed that they had A LOT of servers on staff for the festival so everything was prompt and looked after 

The food: we had the Mexican street corn, the chicken taco, pork confit and the cod. I didn't try it but my mother said the chicken was very good, the corn was yummy and grilled -  drizzled with a rich sauce. I did not like the In Cod we Trust. Maybe it's because I don't like cod (never had it before) but it wasn't for me. BUT the pork confit taco was seriously the best friggin taco i have ever had! 

Ambiance- a little dark and the music was loud which is something I don't really mind but I was dining with my mom who isn't a fan of youthful goatee ambiance. Either way, I will be back."}
{"text":"I don't have anything bad to say, but nothing exciting to report on either. I found the tacos to be ok (maybe even a little on the bland side), the ambiance ok, the service ok and the price ok.  La Carnita essentially copied Grand Electric and isn't as good."}
{"text":"La Carnita occupies an interesting spot in Toronto's taco landscape.  I'm a fan of sister restaurant Home of the Brave, and had heard great things about this place, so I was really looking forward to trying this place out.  Normally I go it solo before bringing others somewhere I've never tried, but a good friend of mine and frequent dining companion decided to drop in on a whim.  Having both eaten at Grand Electric and Seven Lives, we both came away with a similar impression.

So first, the good. The service here was outstanding.  The staff was friendly, hugely attentive, and were willing to do everything imaginable to work around my DC's killer combo of gluten-is-murder Celiac's disease and even more deathly mango allergy.  And that's no easy feat, because unlike Seven Lives and Grand Electric (GE), the menu here is rife with gluten and mango.  Our server and the kitchen backing her efforts didn't skip a beat, and were incredibly careful to not kill my DC while being brilliantly friendly about the situation.

The place is really comfy, too.  A little dark, which makes discerning ingredients a bit tough at times, but that's part of the ambience.  I mean, there *IS* ambience to speak of, which isn't really something one can say about GE or Seven Lives.  While seating does exist at GE, it seems to have been carefully selected to encourage leaving as soon as possible, and the place is drafty during the winters; GE is sometimes so cold as to make eating a fairly unpleasant experience for some I've dined there with.  God bless Seven Lives, but they have seating for literally eight people, and that's if their one table is filled with a party of four and not a party of two.  

Meanwhile La Carnita's nicely decorated, neatly appointed, and I daresay they probably even have heat during the winter.  All good things!  Heck, they even break with Torontonian trends by offering reservations for parties of eight or more - awesome.

If the food matched the service and the having-of-chairs-and-stuff, I'd be all about this place.  Sadly it doesn't get there.  Admittedly my impression of some of the dishes were stinted, as adjustments were made to some of them for my DC's needs.  But offerings like the In Cod We Trust Baja fish taco were unmolested, and that was sadly fried a little too long, with none of the light texture or brilliant accompanying flavors of the Seven Lives version (which is still the handsdown Toronto winner for Baja fish tacos - Playa Cabana's near-tempura-fried fish taco is an abomination to this expat San Diegan's sensibilities).  The Carnitas and the Beef Cheek both seemed stewed or steamed in not-so-favorable senses of the words, and neither matched up to Grand Electric's equivalents.  Ingredients like green apple and crispy shallots were swallowed up by bland meat-tastes and tortilla.  There's not alot of flavor going on, and what's happening isn't layered or interesting.

I'm probably making the food sound worse than it deserves, but what I'm trying to get at is that the food here doesn't compare to other top Mexican places in Toronto.  However at the opposite end of the spectrum, the service is stellar and the space is really comfortable, so I'll probably head back from time to time anyways."}
{"text":"Eating dinner in the dark, in a club seems unreasonable for any other place. For tacos , it is acceptable. 

A table of 5 took a hour & a half . We were let to our metal park table with benches and ordered our feast.

I had one ceviche which was amazing.
Two Carnita which were average.
The pollo although good not spicy enough
Two beef check which were also amazing.
Cod was good.

We ate like five corn orders 

My friends meals took a lot longer than mine and I was done my food.

Overall a great food experience and tasty tacos.

With dessert tax & tip for 5:$250"}
{"text":"The food here is good but nothing to write home about. We ordered chips and guac, street corn and the pollo frito, beef cheek and carnita tacos. The chips and guac was just ok- El Cabillito makes some bombbbbbb taro chips & guac compared to La Carnita. The tacos came out a bit late and were lukewarm... the street corn was the best dish we ordered in my opinion. The music was really loud and I could barely carry on a conversation. On the plus side, the service was attentive and refilled our glasses every 3-5 minutes. But its not enough to make me want to come back."}
{"text":"Came at 2pm. Host wouldn't let my bf & I sit at a booth because you needed 3 or more people... even though whole restaurant is empty  got the lunch prix fix - ps some tacos are extra charge even though it says ANY & they don't have paletas also. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Used to be a regular at the college street location, the quality of the tacos are still good but the portions have gotten smaller and prices have gone up each small taco is now like 6 bucks it might sound trivial but when you get three of them and and are still really hungry there's a bit of a problem."}
{"text":"Had a great time tonight at La Carnita (College). I've been to the John location plenty of times but tonight was my first time at College and I have to say I prefer this location as I so appreciate that they take reservations. 

It was a busy Friday night and our orders still came out quickly. The staff was very attentive as well. 

If you go, you must get the wings appetizer as they were phenomenal. Trust in Cod is my favourite taco!"}
{"text":"Ate here on Sunday night with a group of 8.  Everyone loved it.  Highlights:  Sunday Night Ribs, Cod Taco, Chicken Taco, Beef Cheek Taco, Corn and Nachos with 3 dips... Yummy yum yum!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and atmosphere, drinks are okay priced but really really good. Best tacos are the steak and fish."}
{"text":"Beautiful food, pricey for sure, small portions. Good atmosphere except the chairs were hard. Our waitress was extremely rude to our table. Said that I didn't understand the concept of Mexican because I asked for one of my tacos not to be spicy. I know serving is a hard and long job so I felt embarrassed for what I asked and in order to placate her cattiness, I asked her what else she recommended- she sold us on a pitcher of margarita without telling us that it was over $50!! Like fuck. Really? She was just SO rude- I would come back but only on the condition that she never serves me again."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had been to this location (I had been to the College St location a few years back).  To be honest, this restaurant is so dimly lit, and so very narrow - I wouldn't recommend a large party of 6+. I went with my SO, and we ordered the street corn - which I would recommend.  However, the tacos were SO small, and SO overpriced... Even the Drinks were over-priced! Honestly - save your money and go elsewhere.  My SO and I had 1 drink each, 1 order of Corn (2 full cobs), and 5 tacos (combined)... our order was $82.00. And we were STILL hungry. I mean, we've spent less on 2 Classic Meals at the Keg. I would not recommend if you're looking for a filling meal without spending a fortune."}
{"text":"This rating is ridiculous! We went to this location yesterday and it was such a lovely experience. The place looked gorgeous. Good for going on dates or hanging out with friends. Servers were attentive and funny. We ordered the sangria which was deceivingly strong! But it was soooo good. And the food... Omg the food. The flavours were explosive and there were so many layers to the flavour. I could eat the tostada de ceviche forever. The pollo fritto and carne asade were really good too. Good enough for a repeat order. 

The only con I can think of is the price. Prepare to pay a little more for the food and drink. I would have given this place 5 stars if it was a little cheaper. But hey, I will for sure come back!"}
{"text":"This place was really built up among my circle of close associates, so was expecting so much more.... atmosphere - check, music - check, art on the walls - check, drinks - check, awesome Mexican food - was checking all night but couldn't find it... 

Tried every type of taco - cod, beef check, chorizo, chicken and so forth... the only one that was decent was the chorizo... the rest were simply over-rated. Seems like everyone likes the idea of this place being great rather than really examining the actual food. On top of that, service was fairly slow since this place is so popular!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a very cool vibe and amazing food La Carnita is the right place to stop at. The menu is very small which means you know everything you order has been perfected. I always go with the Mexican Street Corn. It's a must. They load it with chili powder and cheese. Yes, it's messy but it's so worth it. Their tacos are also incredible. My favorite so far is the Crispy Cotija. It's fried cheese so of course it's great. Every day they have a different taco of the day which is very cool. 
Now on to dessert. They have these churros here. They are life altering churros. I cannot express to you how important these churros are so please come here and order them. I dream about them, they are the perfect churros."}
{"text":"The food is fusion style Mexican cuisine. Not every fusion works, but here it just makes sense. The scorpion wings are crispy, tender, and very flavourful - matches the beer here very well. The tacos, too, rich in flavor and texture. Great vibe and service. It is a package of experience like the other popular trendy places."}
{"text":"I recently came here for the second time, mostly because I adore corn so wanted to try their amazing looking Mexican street corn. Did the corn live up to my expectations? I would say YES. Believe me, I have eaten a LOT of corn during my lifetime, but I will say never with flavours like this. Topped with Mexican crema, queso anejo, arbol & ancho chili powder, each bite is just bursting with these wonderful flavours. Even though I found it to be too spicy with the chili powder, I had to continue eating because it still tasted so good.

As for the main feature, the tacos, I can say with certainty that they are quite good, but not the best I've had. Most recently I had the beef cheek, the special of the day (Thursday - duck) and crispy cotija which is a vegetarian one with cauliflower and beans. I can't complain about them, because I thought they were all flavourful and tasty. I have to say I like the soft taco shells at Campechano (https://www.yelp.ca/biz/campechano-taquer%C3%ADa-toronto?osq=campechanos) more though, they just tasted fresher and full of corny goodness.

I also couldn't resist trying some of their desserts this time! The churros came out hot and fresh - the order comes with 3 and they are pretty big. Taste just like the tiny tom cinnamon donuts mmm. I also tried the tres leches cake - it comes in a pretty sizeable portion in a little glass jar. The cake part is light and fluffy, but topped with many many layers of cream which really fill you up. I really liked the large coconut flakes at the very top - if you like coconut things then you'll enjoy this because the flavour is really strong. I couldn't finish this in the end because I got too full, perhaps share this with another person.

In terms of the ambiance, it's a bit hit or miss for me. It feels hip and trendy and lively, and I like that. Both times I came, the music was on point, great hiphop/urban jams. The downside to all that is that it gets super loud and rowdy - if you're looking for a place to relax after work and chat with your friends then I would not recommend coming here, you'll just be shouting at each other. Also it is incredibly dim in there, to the point where you can hardly even read the menu. I think in general I've had more enjoyable dining experiences at other places - I remember at Campechano I was able to really focus on all the tacos I had and all of the flavours in each one, but at La Carnita I just get so overwhelmed by all the activity and sensory overload that the actual taco flavours take a back seat.

In the end, my friend and I each had three tacos, a cob of corn each, and shared the desserts, and left feeling super stuffed. Prices here are reasonable, we each threw down $35 and called it a night. I will be coming back in the future, the corn has captured my heart and I've heard the Mexican meatballs are also a must-try item."}
{"text":"La Carnita basically sums up everything I'm looking for in a cool spot. Let's check out the criteria:

Story (check) - Started by ad agency folks, originally as a pop-up food truck. That explains the cool branding and impressive social media presence.

Location (check) - Near College & Bathurst, it's a perfect jump-off for an adventurous night ahead or an easy commute on TTC. The vibe inside is relaxed and uber-hip.

Music (check) - A never-ending classic hip-hop mix, mostly from the early 90s. Illmatic.

Beer & Cocktails (check) - A versatile selection of craft beers on tap with specialty cocktails galore.

Food (check) - Finally, the food lives up to the hype and more. The tacos are fresh, flavourful and full of inspiration - order 3-4 if you want a substantial dinner.

While it's not the cheapest option for Mexican food, it's worth it for the overall experience."}
{"text":"If you want to add some hip to your taco then this is the place to go! You've got a pretty edgy menu that's packed with fantastic flavour.

I've had their Mexican Street Corn and Mexican Meatballs. The street corn is not worth $8 and off-putting with the cream. However, the Mexican meatballs are a winner! Definitely loved scooping up the beef with the chip they provided. 

Their tacos are also generally delicious. They do a mean Chicken Taco aka Pollo Frito. If you're feeling something fishy go for the Squid the Kid Taco (Tuesday) which has calamari in it. Hands down my favorite was the special Arctic Char Tostada - holy heavens! However, I wasn't a fan of the Cripsy Oxtail Taco (Friday), which seemed very bland. 
My most favourite part was desert. Pick up one of their many available flavors of Paletas (Popsicles). For $4 you can have a frozen version of a Nanaimo bar in your mouth - you just can't beat that!

My only complaint is the setup of the place. It's cramped due to the communal seating. However, very necessary for when you need shout to your neighbour over the blaring hip hop. At least the music is good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The food and service were great. Writing this post so I can remember the name next time I'm back in town so I can come again!"}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome and more awesome! Where to start...

My date had been here before and has been bragging about the food here, so I agreed to try it out.

They don't take reservations on weekends.  Came in on a Friday night, they told us the wait would be  an hour and a half...! A little crazy but we put our names on the list and they said they'd text us when a table opens up (in the meantime we took a walk down college and ended up at Eat My Martini  for a few drinks). Finally our text came through and we headed back over.

The atmosphere is LIVE (& I mean that in the best possible way!) It's a smallish, narrow restaurant with tables below/in the back and bar stools along the bar. The place is busy, lively and blasting the top hip-hop and rnb. I couldn't help but to bounce in my seat as I ate my taco! Definitely a fun atmosphere!

Staff was amazing- every single person we interacted with was smiling, laughing and as helpful as they could possibly be. These people were actually enjoying themselves and their work, and it showed! It was a pleasure dealing with the staff here!

The food here is good, oh-so good!!  We started with an avocado-mango salad - highly recommend it, very tasty and different than any mango salad you've had before! On to the tacos - our favorites, in this particular order: 1. beef cheek taco; 2. Chicken taco; 3. La carnitas (pork) taco; 4. Fish (cod) taco.  The beef cheek taco is TO DIE FOR!  I ended up having two of these, it was love at first taste! (I'm sure my date had a great time watching me have food orgasms at the table as we ate) They are roughly $5 each.  The tacos appear fairly small and I'm a pretty hearty eater, so I thought I would need a million of these things to be satisfied. But after three I was feeling good! We asked our server to surprise us with dessert, which ended up being two parts. The first was their signature ice cream bar. It is a vanilla ice cream on a stick (not very creamy, which I liked) covered in Oreo dust...this creation was glorious! But was so messy to eat, with every bite it looked like someone dumped potted soil all over our table! Well worth the mess though! Part two were churros served with a caramel sauce. The churros were okay, they were fairly dense and heavy (I think el catrin has better churros, to be honest)

At the end when we got the bill, the server dropped off a half-page drawing on card stock. It turned out to be a local artist's work. There is an interesting story behind why they do this - but I won't be the spoiler! Ask your server about the art they hand out and how that started :) very cool concept they kept alive!

La Carnita - thank you for a wonderful evening! I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Too loud but that's expected from a bar like this. Good choice of drinks too."}
{"text":"Food was good. It tasted the same as the College location. The service to take our order was slow, even though it wasn't that busy, but once we put our orders through, the food and drinks came under 10min...maybe even under 5.
I dropped my rating to 2 stars, only because it was sooo HOT inside! Not fun hot, not spicy hot, but just horrible temperature hot. This place has terrible air circulation, my friend and I were fanning ourselves with the menus (that our server kindly did not take away) to cope with the heath. I don't think I will be going back to this location only for that fact...I don't enjoy paying to sweat while eating.  Please invest in a proper air cooling system."}
{"text":"This is super close to where I live but honestly the signage is so discreet (a skull) that I walk pass it all the time and didn't know there's a la carnitas right near me!

I came here at 6pm on a Friday and it wasn't too busy as there was still a couple of empty tables. The lights are very dim and the music was gradually getting louder. As a result, people spoke louder to compete in a continuous cycle. We finished and left before it reached to a point where we had to yell.

Besides the less than desirable environment to have a girls night catchup, the food was just amazing. One of the best Mexican joints in Toronto. I like that they don't shy away from adding the spice in their tacos. 

Ordered: 
Mexican Corn - it was yummy but for $4.25 a corn I think I might just order another taco next time 

Beef cheek - It has a nice spicy kick to it. It was perfect for me but I think that it may be too spicy for some others who aren't used to this spice as a default level.

Ceviche - This is simply the best and it's on a crunchy tortilla. All the flavours are melt in your mouth goodness. This one is also spicy but in a good way!

Will definitely come back to try the other tacos and order the ceviche again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night with a friend, and we were surprised to be seated right away on the patio. We ordered the Ricky Rose Sangria, which had a strong mango flavour and was delicious. For starters, we had the tortilla chips, which were sprinkled with some sort of chili powder that made it unique. We chose the guac to go with it, which was smooth and creamy.

The tacos are around $5-8 each, which is not outrageous given the complex flavours and taste. They have specials for each day of the week, and for Wednesday it was a black tiger shrimp taco, which was scrumptiously full of shrimpy flavour (even carried through into the chipotle sauce). We also ordered the crispy chicken thigh (pollo frito) taco, which was just ok. The chunks of chicken were kind of hard to enjoy with everything else in the taco and kept falling out. It also got very watery and messy - not sure if it was the tomatoes in combination with the runny sauce.

Service was mediocre, as our waitress took our order wrong (cod taco never came) and our order ended up getting missed and we waited almost an hour between the apps and mains! She did, however, comp one of our tacos so that was nice. 

Overall this review is 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 because of the vibes and patio. Would definitely come here again to try some of the other tacos on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great tacos, cool atmosphere. A little loud, but that's ok. Nice patio. Next door to Sweet Jesus for dessert!

Starter:

Tortilla Chips with Guacamole dip

Tacos: 

In Cod We Trust

Cod, Voltron sauce, lime crema, pickled red cabbage, green apple & cilantro

& 

Pollo Frito

Crispy chicken thigh, peanut mole,honey, Rossy's hot sauce, green cabbage & salsa fresca"}
{"text":"Where do I start?

This review could have been turned out far more positive had it not been for the lazy and care-free attitude of the management (or whoever runs their Twitter account). 

I went in for lunch the previous Saturday with a friend for lunch before the movies. 

The hostess was half asleep. No energy. No umph. No smiles. No desire to be there. Nothing. 

Our server was mediocre at best. Took the order and was pretty much out of the picture after that. 

The food runner almost dropped the food on the table. Stated the name of the dish as if it were the most boring and depressing thing in the world. No eye contact. No check in to ensure we were good. Nothing. Gone. 

Now, I've been to a lot of taco joints, so I couldn't understand how is it possible that any of the food is served without salsa at this place.

I couldn't get anyone's attention, so I walked to the bar, asked the bartender for some hot salsa, and he provided me with a bottle. 

Like other taco joints I've been to, I guess it's self serve on the salsa at La Carnita. 

Then, the food runner comes by and starts removing plates before the food on the main plates was gone. I even said \"we're still working on it.\" But she still took our plates. 

I guess they just couldn't wait to get us the hell out of there. 

The server came by. I asked for the bill. It took about 10 minutes. 

The food? Really, really good. I might have increased my rating based on the food, however ... 

I tweeted about it. 
The restaurant's response was lazy. 
They have removed it since, but they said, and I quote:
\"Reeealy (sic) hate hearing this, but appreciate that u care enuf (sic) to tweet us. We will take a close look. Hope we see you again.\"

A couple of back and forths, but not a single inquiry as to why my experience wasn't good. No effort to correct a poor customer service experience. 

I basically said that the staff's attitude was a reflection of the management. 

Their actual last response to me was:
\"Uh, alright man, do your thing.\"

Completely unprofessional - and they don't deserve a dime of anyone's money. 

The Playa Cabana chain could teach these guys a thing or two about how it's done. And really, the food is much better. They'll even bring you salsa to the table."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner ( no reservation) on a Saturday evening around 5:30pm and were able to find seating without any problem. It's okay for babies/toddler but not for long as the music is quite loud and place is bit dark ( perfect for date nights or single people). Service was good.

About food- we started off with tortilla chips and guacamole (very tasty) and Margeritas ( which was just ok). Tacos- vegetarian and with meat/fish were very good. We had 5 tacos, guac/chips and couple of drinks for about $80...that's the only drawback ( it's bit pricey). Food in general was spicy, but flavourful ( just beware of spice level). But certainly wouldn't stop us from coming back again. Next time we will only stick to non-alcoholic drinks DNA tacos though."}
{"text":"Overpriced food and lame service. Server was super rude. Tacos were good, but not worth what you pay for. would not recommend"}
{"text":"Completely agree about the music.  I mean  WTF?  It's not south central LA (which is the vibe that the owners want to create being skater types) according to our server.   Aside from that, the service was very good.  Enjoyed the Masa Fritas.  The rhubarb/Cointreau sangria was also enjoyable."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican restaurant! The starters you can share but the tacos are individual. For the starters I recommend: the sweet corn with cheese, the ceviche, the melted cheese with meat and tortillas, and the quesadillas. For the tacos the \"carne asada with avocado\" is fantastic! Margarita is also very good! Recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is one of my fave chill restaurants in Toronto. I first discovered it at the underground food market and they have blown up since then. My fave tacos is the beef cheeks, it has a sweet and meaty delicious taste. Best drink is the who shot ya?? My only suggestion is that they switch up the menu... I've been so many times and now I've tried everything. It would be nice to offer different items for regulars now.
Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the college location many times and was happy that the food was consistent, as expected.  As always, the bar is the best seat in the house (ssshhhh) Tacos were awesome, was nice that they have specials of the day, Saturday was the oxtail; which was delicious! Beef cheeks is always the best on the menu. I will definitely back! Eastside just got 100% cooler!"}
{"text":"Great food but horrendous service....the waitresses are rude and obnoxious! Our group had a two hour limit...exactly in two hours they kicked us out!  Couple of our guest came late...the waitress offered them the menu ...Came back and said too late!  I'd do takeout here or go with a friend but never in groups.  If you go in groups probably best to avoid tipping the waitresses ;)"}
{"text":"The John street location is a good spot for lunch, however, we've been consistently disappointed with the quality of this location. The tacos don't ever taste fresh, the tortillas often taste dry and old. But the cocktails and apps are consistently good!"}
{"text":"By far one of our favourite spots in toronto. Any time want good food, good drinks and good music - we always go to la carnita. A note though : be prepared to wait 45 mins on busy nights. Lots of bars in he area to grab a drink while you wait though."}
{"text":"Prices they charge doesn't justify the quality of food. I understand a lot people like their food and maybe I'm just the odd case. But I have been to many Mexican  restaurants in Toronto and no where is nearly as bad as here. 

The tacos are served on a soft taco shell that they charge between $6-7. The pollo Frito smelled and tasted burnt. Mexican chorizo had a pinch of sausage. The list goes on.

Best of all, chicken bones in the chicken quesadilla we ordered."}
{"text":"The ambiance is cool and the service was okay. In terms of the food it is definitely not with what you pay. I got 2 cod tacos and a beef taco and split the street corn appetizer with 2 other friends. I left feeling hungry and paid $28 taxes and tip in. Cool place to hang out and grab a snack if you're going to expect to feel full you will be let down ."}
{"text":"Small but nice patio. Inside the restaurant old school hip-hop was a nice treat. Great and friendly service. Neat drink menu and specials such as the bourbon and house made cherry coke. Our table of three shared tortilla chips with cilli powder and guacamole which hit the spot. Cod fish taco was decent, small for the price in comparison to similar places where tacos are ~ 3 bucks.. The churros were the highlight of the meal, cooked perfectly and the caramel sauce was amazing! Definitely worth checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Loud and expensive . It's one of my worst experiences. Food is way over priced and you walk out of there hungry . Much better places around the area for the money"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends the other day and had a good experience. The restaurant has a cool vibe: spacious, long tables that are great for groups and/or devouring tacos, a large patio to enjoy the nice weather, fun decorations on the walls. It can get a bit loud but not to the point where it interferes with dinner conversation. We split the \"Queso fundito\" as a starter, which was a cheese dish with red pepper, chilies, scallions and chorizo, served with warm tortilla chips. On Tuesdays, they've got \"Hardshell Taco Tuesday\" which is 8 chorizo tacos with fixings (enough for 2 people to share) for $14. The tacos and sides were great and there was a good amount of meat to fill the tacos with. Really worth it at that price! Overall, a good experience; I'll definitely be back to try some of the other tacos!"}
{"text":"Service:
You should go early to put your name/number down on a busy night. The line can get a bit crazy. You can hang in the area, and they'll give you a call once your table is ready.

It's good for small groups, as large tables are limited. The lighting is also a bit dark, and hard to see what you are eating at times.

Food:
You can share most of the food on the menu, and they have a good selection of tacos you can try. They are small tacos, so you can order 2-3 per person. They can serve the food a bit hotter as to l warm."}
{"text":"Came here with my siblings and enjoyed all the food we ordered.

Got guac and chips, carnitas taco, cod taco, mango salad and their corn.  

The code taco is a must order. It's the bomb.  Also had a sangria to drink. 

A little dark in the restaurant but other than that the food was delish."}
{"text":"Went there for a lunch party and the opps were all awesome (the meatball, the avocado salad), but the tacos were a letdown to me. The chicken was burnt and the pieces were too big to eat in a taco so we had to basically eat the chicken separately from the taco. The fish itself was well cooked, but the taco itself just had far too much acid. We tried to popsicles (sourced from next door Sweet Jesus) and some of them were awesome based on what others said, but my apple cider one literally tasted like someone froze watered down apple cider.
Also, the second floor is a bit on the cold side so some of us were still wearing our coats, so maybe carry a long sleeve or a light sweater."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a friend at 8:45pm. Got seated right away, waiter came right away, food came right away, dessert was offered then came Right away. , bill came during dessert without asking for it, and we were essentially pushed out RIGHT AWAY. I would understand the quick turnover if there was a  lineup, however there was not a single person waiting. The waiter was lovely and kept assuring us he was not \"rushing\" us out but the fact that we were in and out under an hour speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with my foodie friend. Decided to try it out because she wanted to and heard good things about it. 

I found the decorations to be very unique in this restaurant. The lamps were made from old light bulbs, which looked really cool.

We got the mexican street corn to start with, and those are just..i'm so speechless and getting all hungry just thinking about it. It's AMAZING!!! there's just enough of all the toppings and the corn is grilled to perfection and it's soo sweet! I would go back just to have this again!

I tried the in cod we trust taco. I wasn't very impressed. It just seemed very...plain. I was much more excited about the corn then the taco. Since the corn came first, my expectation for the taco was a lot higher, but when it came, it just tasted plain.

my friend and I ended the night with churros and paletas. Paleta's were very unique. I liked it. I liked the churros and their caramel sauce, but there's only 3 small pieces. Didn't seem to be worth the price. Wish they gave more pieces."}
{"text":"Dam good Mexican food and a pretty good vibe there too. All the tacos were great but my favourite was the chicken taco. Had the right amount of deliciousness. You pay by the taco there but it's worth it to try them all once. Nice place to go to every once in awhile. Eat well friends!"}
{"text":"Ok it's too loud and the service could be improved. That said, as a tourist, I had a really good experience trying their tacos. Their cauliflower taco is so good that I would go back and just do three or four of them exclusively. Their fry is perfect on them and the sauce goes so well. I really enjoyed their Smokey mescal libations as well. Their chicken marinade is also interesting and it competes with the best that even the states have. I loved the trendy atmosphere and would love to go again."}
{"text":"started with the meatballs for appetizers- they gave us 3 large meatballs- which were all excellent! would totally get this again

then moved on to the famous tacos- tried the chicken, beef, cod, and pork ones- all of them were great- but the cod and the chicken took the crown home. It was fried chicken and crispy cod under layers of sauce and spicy pickled vegetables- which made for amazing flavours!

got a few drinks- but they werent amazing, they were also out of the ribs which were the special of the day.

but over all great experience, good atmosphere, really good music and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've been to La Carnita on College and loved it! My favourite restaurant!

Tried this new location and it was good. The atmosphere was great and full of energy. We came on a Friday night with no reservations for a friend's birthday and were seated in the upstairs bar as the wait time was going to be a while. The stools were NOT very short-people friendly, lol. Our bartender and server definitely made our night. We had so much fun eating and drinking. Tipped the kitchen and it was fun meeting the Chefs and ringing that bell. Great service and food! Only part that was negative was the cold Mexican corn but no hard feelings! Sweet Jesus is literally right beside it to make your night even better!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! We came here to celebrate my birthday with my sister and brother. We're tough critics since we're huge foodies! We graduated from culinary and pastry school at GBC & little bro just started. We ordered all all the tacos and I have to say the ceviche, in cod we trust and carnitas tacos were my favourites. The street corn was DELICIOUS!!! The Ghost Face Killah wings are THE BEST wings I've ever had and I have tried a lot!!! Definitely recommending it to everyone. The service was great. We sat in the patio and the servers always checked up on us. Visiting again this week. Can't stop craving La Carnita!!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing ! I had 3 tacos (chicken, cod, and asada) and their meatballs. Everything was full of flavor and was just so good ! The atmosphere was great too ! Perfect for happy hour or even date night. I thought the margaritas were expensive and not that strong but the food was amazing ! I'd go again for food but wouldn't for drinks"}
{"text":"Last Sunday, I went out with a girlfriend to try out La Carnita's brunch. Luckily for us, it wasn't busy at all (unlike their popular dinner service) so we were seated right away. 

My friend had an iced Mexican mocha ($3.50) with Mexican chocolate, coffee, and cinnamon. For me, it was way too sweet and the chocolate definitely overpowered coffee. It was definitely more like an iced hot chocolate than a mocha. My agua fresca ($3.50) - mango, coconut and lime for the day's selection - fared much better. It was creamy and refreshing at the same time, and not overly sweet. 

Chorizo sausage taco ($4.75)- spicy maple syrup, crema, confit tomato, and cotija cheese- I loved the bold flavours of the chorizo, even though I couldn't detect much of that spicy maple syrup. This was one of my favourites at brunch. 

Cochinita pibil tostada ($5) - guacamole, achiote braised pork, fried egg- I love anything with a fried egg on top so this was another winner in my books. The flavours were not as bold as the chorizo taco, but still tasty.

Crispy chicken torta ($6.25)- guacamole, crema, habanero honey glaze, salsa fresca, anejo cheese- The torta was more like a crispy chicken burger with a Mexican twist. I loved the habanera honey glaze, which added a fabulous sweetness to the sandwich. The overall combination of taste and texture was great. If I had to levy criticism, it would be the bun, which was a touch too dense. 

Roasted pork belly sope ($6.25)- roasted pork belly, poached egg, arbol lime hollandaise- This was the most brunch-like dish out of everything we ordered, but I wasn't a huge fan of the hollandaise, a sauce I normally love. It was too sour (presumably from the lime) for my liking. 


Churros with housemade cajeto ($5) - Can't have a satisfying brunch without some desserts! My last few churros experiences have been disappointing, so I was glad that these ones were excellent! 

Overall, brunch was enjoyable, but I thought that the their tacos were more successful than the more brunch-like offerings. Nevertheless, brunch here was definitely worth a visit, but I'll be returning for their tacos for dinner."}
{"text":"Overpriced, not authentic and cold food. Not a good spot, noisy  place and unfriendly staff."}
{"text":"So this is the new hot spot?

Went for lunch just before Christmas with a friend. I like the decor and the place has good energy but the food ranged from meh to good.

Ordered the chicken wings. Meh... at best. Then came the meatballs. A little overcooked but good flavour with a little kick. Finished with the daily taco special - a shrimp taco. It was good.

This wouldn't be my first choice the next time I feel like Mexican.

Really like their logo though..."}
{"text":"Ate here on a recommendation.   Had the meatballs which had a kick and were quite tasty as an appetizer. We also ordered the ceviche tacos, a pork taco and a chicken taco.  The ceviche had a lively, fresh taste.   The sangria was refreshing.  Those are the plusses.  The minuses: loud, contemporary music -- i.e., hip-hop -- and very slow service.  The server redeemed herself at the end by giving us places to go the next day to eat and sightsee."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I wanted to love La Carnita. I've heard great things, it looked super cool, and I've always wanted to go. However, by my rating, you can tell I didn't love La Carnita.

Our waitress came over to take our order I asked her to omit the cheese from the tacos I ordered. She asked if it was an allergy, and I said no, I just don't eat cheese/don't like cheese. She told me that they couldn't make the tacos without cheese as they were \"already kind of made\". She then told me \"just try it you will like\". I ended up not liking any of the tacos due to the cheese taste and I was kind of left feeling like I had just wasted my money.

It kind of sucked that I now wish I had lied about an allergy just to enjoy my food. Not cool."}
{"text":"La Carnita is a sad so called \"Mexican\" food. My Mexican friends would all be ashamed to eat here. The selection is extremely limited and the portion are more like tapas.  The price of each taco is about $6.00. I was able to finish a taco in two bite. Which come out to $3.00 dollar a bite.  The food taste like it was made in a microwave. No flavor whatsoever. The music playing in the background is loud and obnoxious. You need to speak really loud to have a conversation.  If you're looking for some real Mexican food, I suggest you go elsewhere. If you're seeking a gringo's version of what tacos should taste like, then you come to the right place. Get ready to pay out the nose for poor quality food."}
{"text":"I visited La Carnita on a Saturday night around 8PM for a friend's birthday - I had heard a lot of good things about the food and was excited to see if the tacos could live up to the hype!

The tacos were delicious (I tried a few of the 'In Cod We Trust' fish tacos), but at almost $5 each a healthy appetite will cost you here, as the tacos are on the small side. 

I was pleased with the atmosphere, the service, and the amount of space, and would definitely 4-star this restaurant if my dollar went a little further - all in all a fun spot to go for some drinks and light food!"}
{"text":"Good prices and taco selection. Slow service. 

Came with a few friends after work on a weekday and it was pretty busy inside. Ordered the fried chicken thigh taco (it was actually sweet, which was surprising) and the chorizo taco (my fave). You also must try the corn, it's amazing! Service is very slow, but I would still come back for the cool vibe and good location."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is bursting with flavours!!
The music is a bit loud, but can still easily have a conversation at the table - especially the high-top tables. The way they have the menu, makes it so you can order variety, and NOT spend a fortune.
The corn is spicy, and the Sat. special taco is as well. But very tasty!!!
Skip Barrio, which is further East. THIS is where the good food is at!"}
{"text":"Get some better speakers. Your sound system is terrible.  Really terrible.  The food is great! Cocktails are also good. Get the Sweet Jesus Cookie Monster Popsicle for dessert. You won't regret it. $ value is off the charts reasonable.  I have an idea. Add a buck to each taco. No one will notice. Then buy some speakers. Take up a collection. Kickstarter, Go Fund Me. Anything. Just fix the sound."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of La Carnita and the College location is up there for one of my favourite taco places. I have now been twice to this location. The food is good as at other locations however the service was mediocre.

The first time was a busy Saturday night and we had to wait almost 2 hours for a table. We ended up eating at the bar. Bartenders were awesome.

Second time was part of a large group. The hostesses at the front were very rude and did not make me feel very welcome (I was the first to arrive). Once we were seated the servers were good. Did a great job considering how many of us there were! I also find this location very loud, almost club like. I am sure this is part of the plan but don't expect to be able to hear anyone very well!

We ordered the chips, wings, corn and several tacos. All were very good as at other locations. The corn is by far my favourite and a must try! Menu is a bit limited.

Overall not bad but I expected more from La Carnita."}
{"text":"The Gen X set should not be scared away from this place only because so many reviews mention that it is a hipster hangout. The aged will neither enjoy the musical selection nor the volume but it's fine for most of the pre-retired.

Seating options include tables, banquettes and booths. Lovely stained glass windows at the entrance. Unusual lighting over the booths comprised of unlit light bulbs in metal cage surrounding a lit bulb.  Washrooms are downstairs, not wheelchair accessible.

My guest ordered a margarita ($12) which came in a small glass that was half filled with ice. A bit chintzy for the place. I ordered a Sangria that was bigger but came in a plastic cup. Unacceptable.

We would have ordered a pitcher of margaritas or sangria but for the prices. The margarita pitcher is $50 and the sangria is right behind at 
$40. I may be wrong on those prices but if I am it is because I've got them too low, not too high. Feel free to correct me. Either way it's too much.

We shared the mango salad. It was fine but not what we anticipated. That's okay - we should all have our expectations challenged on occasion.

My In cod we trust and daily special squid tacos ($5 each) arrived promptly and we tasty. However, I ate alone as my guest's meatballs came out much later. We asked if they had been forgotten, so long did they take. I'm not convinced that they hadn't been forgotten and our question reminded someone of that. They were tasty and worth the wait.

The overall experience was fine. I might go back if I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Well, I guess it's my bad for not taking the reviews seriously.  Four of us went for dinner and within an hour of leaving La Carnita, we were all hungry!

The portions are crazy small.  And let's be honest people... chips & salsa, 1 pitcher of Sangria and 8 tacos should not be $120 with tip!  Each taco/tostada is Barbie-sized. (I think even Barbie would unhappy with the portions!)

I asked if they could please put the grilled fish option on a taco rather than a tostada and the waitress refused to even see if my request was possible.  She just looked me straight in the face and said, \"No substitutions.\"  That is not a substitution.  When you have cholesterol issues and you ask to tone down the fat by switching the carb so it isn't fried is simply a healthy request.  I also thought about ordering a salad but the waitress said absolutely not when I asked for the dressing on the side.

La Carnita may be a fun place for some but for me and my friends it was simply an unhealthy and overpriced place to dine that we will not be returning to."}
{"text":"Great tacos. Loved them. Spicy queso bean dip was cold though, I mean they meant for it to be cold but it's still wierd to not have warm queso. Also they seem to be VERY busy. People lined up outside waiting for them to open kinda busy. I would definitely say they are worth a visit."}
{"text":"This place was just fine. I was going to come here (well, the downtown location) with my colleagues on a Thursday night but it was full by the time we got there at about 7:30pm, and we were told it'd be about an hour wait. So I ended up going to the Eglinton location when I was in the area, right when they opened on a Saturday.

The sign on the door as well as the website said this place opened at 11:30am on Saturdays, but the door was locked when I tried to enter at about 11:45am. Someone saw me and let me in right away, but one of the servers told me they were actually open in 15 minutes. Regardless, they let me sit down.

I went for the first three tacos on the menu - the fish, the fried chicken, and the beef cheek. They were decent, but I found the flavours to be very, very acidic in general, which is something I tend to shy away from. I think everything would have tasted much better with more restraint on the citrus juices/vinegars in the sauces. I also understand now why some places double-tortilla their tacos - La Carnita uses just one, which ripped very easily and was messy to eat. I was not given utensils, but I was provided with about 3 thick, good quality serviettes.

The fish was good - nice and crisp. The green apple added even more tartness to the already very sour marinated cabbage, so I found myself kind of wincing when I took bites when there was no fish. The fish was nice and crisp, and it was a good size. I do think they could have drained it a little longer though, before they assembled the taco (it's fried).

The chicken was alright. I liked the sweetness - kind of unusual in tacos and I like it! However, I feel like the chicken could have been a little crispier - it felt like it had been sitting for a while. I wonder if they maybe made this one first and it was waiting while the other two were assembled. The chicken just wasn't as juicy as I was kind of expecting/hoping. But I liked the chunky peanut mole - the sauces were good.

The beef cheek was probably my least favourite - very stringy and dry, and just quite lean-tasting. The marinade/seasoning was good but the meat just tasted quite dry. The toppings and sauce were also quite sour.

The decor is very funky and cool. The hipstery staff were alright - my server was very nice.

All in all, this was alright - I'd return if friends wanted to come but I probably wouldn't come here on my own. And I'd probably stick to the fish!"}
{"text":"A popular lunch spot in the Entertainment District with a vibrant dining atmosphere. Although the price might be on the $$$ side, the Street Corn and Tacos are fantastic. Get there early to beat the lunch rush, or be prepared to wait for a table.

Featured in the picture:

Mexican Street Corn - Mexican crema, queso anejo, arbol & ancho chilli powder

In Cod We Trust - Cod, Voltron sauce, lime crema, pickled red cabbage, green apple & cilantro

Tostada de Ceviche - Albacore Tuna, guacamole, coconut milk, habanero, tomato, cucumber.

Their Daily Special - a type fish I can't seem to recall."}
{"text":"Ok not the greatest.  Dollar taco night was not whatever thought, drinks a little on the high side."}
{"text":"Tacos are always getting my appetite!! Besides the perfect fruity dessert, my dinner is right on point... (Recommendations? Everything!)"}
{"text":"I've been to La Carnita a bunch of times and I love this place for the food, the service and vibe. The several times I've gone I never had to wait long for a table (maybe I was just lucky, who knows!)

Food wise, their cod tacos are the bomb. So delicious and everything in the taco works together. The mexican corn is delicious as well - the char from the grill with the crema and chili powder gives the dish a good kick. Messy to eat but worth every bite. Churros and the paletas are a must too (love the key lime pie one!)! If you don't want to wait in line at Sweet Jesus for paletas then get them at La Carnita. Sangria is awesome as well!

Service is friendly, waiters are attentive. The vibe is casual and the hip hop music is loud, but it's a fun place to be at for lunch/dinner. Would definitely take friends there who haven't been there before."}
{"text":"Having been a fan of La Carnita's food from the very beginning when they first opened on College St, this location of La Carnita is about a 5 minute walk away from the Eglinton subway station. The restaurant itself is next to a Sweet Jesus and shares a space with Good Fortune Bar (which is downstairs). The vibe is what you would expect from this ever growing taco joint - hip hop music blaring from the sound system as well as platters of delicious tacos enjoyed by many. 

I've been to La Carnita plenty of times (whether it is the uptown location or the two downtown locations - on John St. and on College St.), and have come to like their food. Recently having gone again to this location, I noticed there were a few differences in price and portions. Sadly, a cod taco now costs $5.79, definitely an increase in price since previously. The menu has also expanded to have a few more items but overall, the price of the food has increased and the portions of the food have decreased. Although the flavours of the food are still on point, I am somewhat disappointed by the pricing and portion of the food. There comes a point where you realize that sometimes, the food is not worth it for the price...and I came to that realization this time going to La Carnita. There are other taco joints in the city which offer similar options for way less. 

Overall, will not be going to La Carnita as often as I used to anymore due to these changes.  I did see that they have a lunch special for $15.99 which seems reasonable. Food is good but prices...not so much."}
{"text":"I have been anxiously waiting to visit La Carnita.  I had initially caught my obsession for Mexican eats over at another local spot (identifiable by the sombrero wearing shark), but had heard about La Carnita and their flavour-blasting tacos, and finger-licking sweet corn.

It's a Thursday night, my two friends and I had just finished a workout and we built up quite an appetite. Both of them have been here before, and they are about to take my La Carnita V-card.  The venue is mid-sized with graffiti covered walls which is made visible by the industrial light fixtures...there is a red florescent \"La Carnita\" sign at the back of the restaurant -- my personal favourite  touch to the decor. 

Under La Carnita's \"Daily Specials\" we find the Ghost Face Killah Wings. We add the Mexican Street Corn to start.  We wait about 10 minutes before the first appy arrives, and I am not disappointed. The wings are the B.O.M.B!! The meat literally falls off the bone, and the sauce...THE SAUCE, finger-licking, plate-licking, lick your friend's face amazing.  The Mexican Street Corn follows shortly after (hard follow-up after the wings), again, not disappointed. Best corn on the cob I've had, it's grilled, drizzled with this crema, and dusted with a medley of spices...I swear I tasted some sort of cheese as well. I'm not even sure where I could find a corn that could compete.

Tacos were next on my radar.  Any Mexican joint serving up tacos generally has their version of fish taco, I decided on In Cod We Trust & the Beef Cheek taco --looks like I was in for a little surf & turf. I started with the fish taco; the cod is perfectly battered, crispy outside, and moist inside -- surprisingly spicy! The beef cheek is so flavourful, I think it's the same crema used on the corn? $4.75 per taco is not bad, considering the portion size.

We finish our visit, with house-made Popsicles. The 2 favourites are the Key Lime Pie and Cookies n Cream - if you haven't over-eaten at this point, I highly recommend ordering dessert!"}
{"text":"LOVED our experience here.  TIP: Make reservations as this place gets busy. 
We were seated at top floor which is dark and cool.  Starred wig the three dip nachos which was excellent.  It came with fresh guacamole, bean dip and corn dip and all were good.  Corn dip a dip spicy. Also had the Mexican corn which was amazing and cooked perfectly.  We shared some tacos, my favourites were the steak as came with big piece of avocado, the chicken and the best one for me was chorizo taco.  This was surprising as I'm not a chorizo fan but I LOVED them!! Also the chorizo quesadilla was amazing.  The service is outstanding and although it can get pricy as your order more well worth it!!"}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago with a friend to finally try it out. It was a good experience! The servers were friendly and quick considering how busy it was.

I started off with the cesar which was named something else because it was Mexican style. Instead of vodka it had beer which was an interesting change as I am a frequent cesar drinker but not much of a beer drinker. I had to ask at one point for some more clamato. It was definitely good but not something I'd order often.

My friend and I split the street corn to start. It was good but very spicy and a little cheesy, be warned!

For my main I got two tacos, the tuna and the chicken. Definitely liked the tuna better, it tasted very fresh and healthy. The chicken was fried which was kind of disappointing but it was my own fault for not reading that much into the details. Would have preferred grilled but that's okay! 

We were much too full for dessert but I noticed that they had sweet jesus ice creams on their dessert menu so good on them! 

I would definitely return eventually"}
{"text":"A friend suggested this place and we decided to give it a try. 

Food was okay - except fot the tostada de ceviche and the churros which were really good- but in general on the pricey side, which is expected since this is supposed to be a 'cool and trendy ' taqueria. 

The hostess was nice but I found the music way too loud! So loud I couldn't hear my friend sitting across from me. The waitress bumped me and my chair multiple times during the night trying to access the other tables even spilling some water on my back once. Yes, like the other people mentioned, the space is really really tight! And no, she did not apologize ... not even once. The food was slow. 
We ordered churros for dessert, since the order is 3 pieces the waitress said \"the order is 3 pieces only but for you I can make it 4\"  I thought she was trying to make up for the rest of the night but no. When the bill came she charged us extra for it. Of course I asked her why she offered it and if it was chargeable but instead of apologizing she said she doesn't have to tell me anything and that they never tell clients about extra charges that I should just pay for it like the rest of the people do. I would have payed if she had a different attitude. She removed it from the bill but they lost us as a client. 

Beware, this place has cranky waitresses! You will get way better service and same good food from Mariachi."}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday night around 7:20pm with a friend and was told there would be a 30-40 minute wait. This was not a big deal for us as we had anticipated the popular joint to be busy. After asking for my phone number they used a waiting time website for me to see how much longer the wait would be which I thought was neat. We ended up only waiting 20 minutes.

My friend and I got the guacamole and chips to start ($9.95), and they make a mean guac. Highly recommended. We also got 3 tacos to share:
- In Cod We Trust ($5.79)
- Carne Asada ($6.79)
- Pollo Frito ($5.79)

My favourite had to be the cod one, the flavours worked very well together but to be honest all of the tacos tasted good. The Carne Asada one with flat iron steak was probably the least messy to eat. The Pollo Frito with fried chicken had a good crunch and was tender.

I wish the water they brought in the bottles for our table were cold but other than that it was a great time!"}
{"text":"I frigging love this place! We were told that there was a 20 minute wait for a table to become available but it ended up being only 10 minutes (yay!). We ordered the Mexican street corn to start and it was AMAZING! The sauce with the chili spices on the grilled corn was a perfect combination.

We ordered a few different tacos to try out: Tostada de Ceviche, In Cod We Trust, Pollo Fritto, and I believe they had a special carnita taco going on that night with pork and pineapple. The Tostada de Ceviche was on a crispy fried taco shell with avocado and the combination was magical. The cod taco was tasty with the pickled red cabbage and green apple. It gave a nice texture to the taco. The Pollo Fritto had crispy chicken thigh with a peanut mole, honey, some  hot sauce, green cabbage, and salsa. The carnita special taco that night was delicious with the pork and the pineapple. It had a fresh taste to it.

We also had a sweet tooth that night so we ordered the Tres Leche Cake. It was a cake soaked in milk. It was a little small for what I thought I was going to get but it was still yummy.

The service was fabulous with our waitress coming by our table enough to make us feel wanted but not to the point where we were feeling rushed. I will definitely come back here to spend the rest of my money. $5 per flavourful taco? I love it."}
{"text":"A little noisy for conversation 
Good marg deals
Good food
Good service 
Nice vibe inside, good volume music 
Will return here for sure"}
{"text":"This midtown location of La Carnita is much larger than the original one on College. I found the noise level to be less deafening as well, which allowed for actual conversations to occur at your table. The service seems to have improved here too, as our server was very attentive and was able to split our bills. They seem to be shedding the standoffish hipster attitude which the original is known for. And probably for the better, as their newest restaurants have been under scrutiny for this since their openings. 

The food will always be the highlight at La Carnita though, as the tacos are some of the best you can find in this fusion style. We started off with an order of the tortilla chips with guacamole dip. Even this simple starter tasted better than average, as the chips were crispy fresh and the guacamole was seasoned with spices.

Next came the order of tacos. Although small in size, these things are more filling than they appear. I would recommend getting 3 or 4 of these for a satisfying meal.

My favourite taco of the night was the Chorizo one. Although overly salty, I felt that it had the most complex combination of flavours. I especially enjoyed the taste of the cotija cheese with the chicharron and chorizo in it.

The tostada de ceviche never fails to impress and I would recommend it for any ceviche lover. The fish over top a bed of guacamole and a crispy tostada is fantastic.

In Cod We Trust is the signature taco of this chain, but I honestly think that it tastes very average in flavour. The Voltron sauce that they use is not very noticeable and the taco didn't stand out to me. 

The Pollo Frito taco is my usual go-to taco at La Cartina, but I didn't enjoy it as much at this location. It might have because it was the last one that I ate and it had gotten cold. Otherwise, it is usually amazing since deep fried chicken is hard to screw up. The combination with the mole sauce is what makes it an amazing taco though.

Overall, the meal was great and the majority of the menu items were winners. The one complaint I have, however, is with the cost of the food. At 6 to 8 dollars per taco, this is definitely one of the most expensive places to eat tacos in the city. Based on older photos of their menu, the prices are increasing at a rate that is hard to justify as well. So while the food is great, you should be prepared to spend close to $30 on your meal here (before adding in drinks). I would've given this place 5 stars for the food and experience, but the value just wasn't there."}
{"text":"I've been to La Carnita many times and always forget to write a review for this awesome place. I've been to all 3 locations but this is the one that I visit the most. 

It's a very lively happening place, with crazy decor, and loud music. So if you want to get to know someone or have really in depth conversations with your group, this is not the place because you probably won't be able to hear them.

From the starters, I've ordered the Mexican street corn, Meatballs, and the Barbacoa pork ribs (which is their Sunday special). The corn is to die for. Never liked corn on the cob until I ate it at La Carnita. A MUST HAVE when you come here. The meatballs are also very flavourful and the Barbacoa pork ribs are superb, mouthwatering, lick your fingers superb!

Out of the tacos, their \"In Cod We Trust\" is my favourite. One of the best fish tacos I've had and I love the sauce in it which has a bit of a bite. I have had all the tacos served here, but aside from the cod, my favourites are the Tostada de Ceviche, Carne Asada and the Mexican Chorizo.

For dessert, their churros are served with a delicious Dolce de Leche sauce. The only reason I give La Carnita a 4/5 and not a 5/5 is because the churros if you get them on a good day are amazing. But twice when I went, the churros were dry and almost seemed stale. Other than this, La Carnita is a great place and a place we bring all our out of towner friends to for some good eats and a good vibe. And expect a wait on busy nights, this place does not take reservations."}
{"text":"Great food, great place, the tacos were extremely good, they not only taste like real Mexican food, they also have an extra something that make them special. The atmosphere of the place is excellent as well. Definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere, we sat on outdoor patio. The tortilla chips were very flavourful on its own, but it's even better with guacamole dip. I ordered the Pollo Frito taco, which is boneless chicken thigh with mild sauce (original menu item comes in hot sauce). It was really great tasting! Each person only spent $10. As per the location, it's really crowded. You basically have to cut through the Sweet Jesus line to get into La Carnita. Service could be better, but i didnt have high expectations for such a casual dining place."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos. They are all Ala carte and all made to order. They were fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Really good! Tried all of the tacos on the regular menu. My favourite was the ceviche and the cod. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"Holy crop the nachos are amazing here! The nacho chips aren't your typical chips and I believe they are made in-house? Someone correct me. The nachos come with a guacamole (soo good - has a nice kick and spice to it), salsa, and a bean dip (very unique - I don't think I tried anything like this but I love it). I'm definitely coming back here for the nachos. Highly recommend. 

I also tried the fish taco (cod) and the Carne asada taco. Both of them are soft shell tacos and are not bad. I think my favourite of the two is definitely the fish taco. I feel like I would have enjoyed the tacos more if each order came with 2 tacos instead of 1. 

It gets crazy packed here after work hours even during the weekdays. Make sure to come here early or call in for reservations before coming!"}
