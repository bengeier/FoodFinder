{"text":"So glad there is finally some korean food in the northwest.  I adore their side plates. My hubby loves their fried chicken. We've done eat in & take out and weren't disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the sweet and spicy Korean chicken and it was tasty. The side dish of rice was pretty plain, but overall I loved the chicken. Prices are great too."}
{"text":"The bulgogi beef sandwich was so flavorful and satisfying. I'd eat it at least once a week if we lived closer! You seriously have to try it. The bulgogi and spring roll dish was also tasty. The restrooms were not the cleanest, but the service and food made me quickly forget that aspect."}
{"text":"I have been to Crunchy house on several occasions , quite enjoyed the fried chicken and viet subs but .
Today i had the worst bibmap (sp) , my issue was everything exept the fried egg wasn't hot , the rice the veg everything . Why serve something in a stone bowl if you arnt going to heat it up to give the rice the crunchy texture that makes his dish so good .
(Correction not stonebowl mixed rice , but still lukewarm rice at best)
I would have been ok with the dish if at least the rice was hot and fresh but sadly it was cooked hrs ago (so it seemed ). 
Also all the recipes i have made for this all the veg is lightly saut√©ed and seasoned , this was just cold carrots julienned and what not . 
When i attempted to alert the waitress she basicly dismissed my concerns that it wasn't a stonebowl bibmbap.
For a authentic mixed rice try ogam accross from chinook mall.
I tried the spicy crab hotpot on a different occasion , it was quite tasty but they served it without any utensils or tools to help you remove the crab meat from the shells , also no extra bowl or plate to put the leftover shells on. So basicly you had to pick the crab out of the boiling hot soup and rip the shells apart with your bare hands and then i dont know toss the shells on the floor?
May have to go back and give them another try but 11 bucks for cold rice seems to make a guy think they don't deserve another try.

(Corrected price)

Reply to the owner ..
Sorry that I misunderstood that this was just a ordinary non stone bowl mixed rice but some of my concerns still stands .
If the rice comes directly out of the rice cooker it must have sat on the counter for a bit , maybe while prepping the veg because the rice was lukewarm at best , sorry if you feel that isn't accurate but I ate the dish. Maybe pop the ceramic bowl with the rice and meat in the microwave for 30 seconds before adding the veg.  If given the option to pay 3$ more for hot rice in a stone bowl i think most people would easily pick that over lukewarm rice in a ceramic bowl.
I understand the side dishes are not supposed to be hot , though i wonder if its worth it to include them when they only amount to 2 tablespoons of kimchi , five tiny chunks of radish and a couple of tablespoons of sprouts?
Also to serve the dish with only a tablespoon of the gochujang sauce seem silly to me , maybe give th customers a small squeeze bottle so they can add it as they see fit without having to bother the waitress?
Looking at the pictures on the menu , i would say the amount of sides / gochujang shown on the picture would be more than enough , what was served was quite a bit less.

2) Spicy crab hotpot , I understand that a set of crab crackers wouldnt be needed for the small swimming crabs served , but I really do think that including a small crab fork would be very helpfull for customers to get all the crab meat out , and if they are just supposed to use their hands more napkins should be provided or maybe some wetnaps ?
I tried very hard to cosume as much of the crab as possible with my hands , without making a huge mess , but sadly i didnt do the best job , sad that the poor crab died only to be half eaten .

I wish you had sent me a private message rather than ...."}
{"text":"Ordered through skip the dishes twice now. Amazing. Chicken is crispy even after the car ride and the subs are awesome. Have had the sweet and sour as well as the mustard and plain chicken. Way better than your kfc or chicken on the way. Not too greasy or too over salted which both other places have. Popeyes is out of the question because it's horrible. The beef bulgogi sub is the way to go. Don't eat out often but for an unhealthy treat this is good stuff. Will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"Called in for pick up. Asked d lady wat their best korean fc was - sweet n spicy!!! Argh, too bad I couldn't buy it cuz i wanted my baby b able to eat too. Ended buying golden crunch. Wow - my baby ate like 2 full pieces of it. Love it. Gonna visit again."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is a bit too dry and not as crunchy. The portion of the hot pot is a big but tastes r ok. Great service."}
{"text":"Oh my god. The only problem I have with crunchy house is that there isn't one closer to where I live!!! The food is AMAZING! Seriously, I had no idea Korean could be so flavourful and delicious! And I'm not talking about that fast food mediocre \"Koryo\" brand - you'll forget all about Koryo when you try Crunchy House! I stopped in while I was at work, and I enjoyed it so much I went back a few days later"}
{"text":"It's located near the crowfoot cineplex cinema. Great place for chilling out with your friends. They have Korean fired chicken, Vietnamese style food, bubble tea and Korean hot pot. So many choices for me. The food is good too. Good place!"}
{"text":"Love the fried chicken and had it twice in one week! when I think about it my mouth waters. And portions are big. I heated up the leftover chicken in the oven two days later and it was still so delicious. It's exactly the same as what I had in Seoul. The restaurant is bright and clean and the owner who serves you is so kind. We will be eating here regularly. Great food great prices and totally awesome service. Eat here!"}
{"text":"Delicious fusion fare with a Vietnamese and Korean twist. I ordered the lunch special hot tofu seafood stew and green onion Korean fried chicken. Made fresh and with great quality. They were quite busy even for it being in the middle of the afternoon on A Wednesday. Support local businesses like this small shop and try out their delicious selection."}
{"text":"Great spicy pork (sub & meal) 
Also Korean beef is top notch. 
One of my go to quick meals on the way home"}
{"text":"This is the best ever Korean Fried Chicken I've ever had in my entire life!!! Ordered the lunch combo \"Boneless Sweet and Spicy Kick Chicken\" which comes with a lunch sized portion of the chicken chunks, side of rice, and your choice of a canned pop. The boneless chicken chunks are deep fried to perfection because it's semi crispy on outside, still tender and juicy on inside, and the sauce that it's tumbled in is so tasty (sweet, spicy, and tangy deliciousness!!!!!). I can't stress how yummy the sauce is!!!!!! 

My only issue is with the side of steamed white rice. The portion of rice is way too little and it'd be perfect if they'd just be more generous with a bigger serving of rice."}
{"text":"Consistent Korean fried chicken cooked and flavoured to perfection! Crunchy house is the treasure of the NW. We've never eaten in the restaurant but have taken the food out or have it delivered. Because of this, our exposure to the menu has been limited to the chicken - and man, do they do chicken right! Just be careful - their spicy chicken is ... very spicy!!! It's addictive my good but I always break out in a sweat eating the chicken. Lol. I'm looking forward to dining in and trying their other menu items."}
{"text":"The very first time I tried Crunchy House was the week it opened, as I was next door at Chianti and saw something different on the block. As I had already eaten dinner, I didn't order a full meal but I was so tempted to try their KFC. I revisited Crunchy House recently for a more complete meal, and I left thinking that the experience fell short of my expectations. 

It's a cute little joint with simple decor, perhaps garishly lit with cool fluorescents that make the restaurant a gleaming distraction on the block (this is a bit counter intuitive for sit down joints, but not the end of the world.) 

The Korean fried chicken did not unseat any of my KFC favourites (Wow Chicken, Olive Chicken, etc). The 3 piece meal I ordered did have three pieces of chicken: ribcage and half a breast, a chicken wing and tip, and the other half of the breast. This is paltry compared to the usual one drum, one breast, and one thigh, and needless to say that I'm a man that enjoys quality in addition to quantity. I opted for the sweet and spicy sauce, which was nothing extraordinary, and definitely didn't inspire me as being homemade. 

The fries were okay, though they weren't at the calibre of Wow Chicken fries, which are thick, crunchy, and not doughy on the inside. Rather than being served traditional korean (barley?) Tea, it was a no-name green tea bag, which was also disappointing. 

I also had their milk pearl tea, which was a tiny thing for $5.50 and was 50% ice..... oh dear. 

I have also tried some of their korean dishes, including a few soups and their bibimbap; which are all acceptable but nothing extraordinary. That in conjunction with the fact that the prices are average means that the value quality ratio was mediocre at best. 

I think there is a lot of great Korean food in the city, and while Crunchy House definitely didn't sin grievously, there are definitely better options at the same price point."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews much, but I thought the food was so tasty that I had to say something. Ordered the extra spicy Korean fried chicken, and it was yummy and actually quite spicy. All the food we ordered tasted really good and fresh. So glad to have a place like this in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Worst service. I got no service in 10min in restaurant. The shrimps in seafood food hotspot are not fresh. Wont visit any more."}
{"text":"The Korean Fried Chicken is amazing - especially the extra spicy version! The portions are pretty generous and the service is fast and on point. I like this place - it's bright and fresh and the menu has lots of options."}
{"text":"Stopped in Friday at 5pm. We were seated quickly as the place is small and only 2 other tables were occupied. Tried the bubble tea and our server was kind enough to divide it into 2 glasses for my son and I to share the one drink. Hubby ordered the boneless chicken with the volcano sauce on the side since we were unsure of heat level. We also had a half chicken with sweet n spicy sauce.

Our order arrived and was piping hot. That is always a good sign! All 3 of us were brave and dipped into the volcano sauce. It was definitely hot and we were glad to get sauce on the side to allow us to control the heat. Volcano sauce is tasty but be prepared for the nose sweats, tears and your heart to race just a wee bit faster! 

I'm marking this resto 3 stars as the boneless was more like popcorn chicken and not strips or pieces like breaded thighs. There was minimal meat. However, the bone in was very good. The sweet n spicy is reminiscent of a sticky Thai sauce with a hint of heat. Overall, this was good and service was excellent.  I'd like to return to try the other menu items. The chicken was not the wow factor for me  but believe they've other items that will hit the mark.  I will report back soon and hope that my fellow Yelpers fill us in on their favourite dishes!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I came here again because I've been craving their fried chicken like MAD so Amanda and I came solely for the fried chicken. We ordered a half order of sweet and spicy kick and decided to try something different so we went with half an order of green mountain boneless chicken, we also ordered a side of rice.

OK ok ok ok ok ok DROOL. The green mountain was literally a small mountain of boneless bites that were tossed in some honey mustard sauce and topped with long pieces of green onion. I didn't expect honey mustard sauce but boy was it good, it had a nice light honey mustard flavor and the chicken was tender on the inside and an amazing crunch on the outside. The sweet and spicy kick was same old FANTASTIC, it tasted exactly how I had it the first time. I LOVE their batter, its just so good I cant even explain you have to try it out for yourself.

Crunchy House's fried chicken is the BEST KFC in ALL of Calgary. Perfect crunch, perfect sauce to meat ratio, perfect batter, perfect everything. And its always consistent, from the first bite to the last, I was MMMMM'ing and couldn't believe how good it was.

I already can't wait to go back :)))))"}
{"text":"Review: takeout.

Wanted some Korean fried chicken after work and knew crowfoot recently opened a new Korean fried chicken restaurant. Of all types of fried chicken, Korean has always been my favorite.

Bottomline: Typical Korean fried chicken joint. Good for a quick bit if you are around this part of town.

Atmosphere: cafe style restaurant. Friendly place. Took them a bit of time to recieve my order (which I didn't mind because then I know the chicken is made fresh).

Food: ordered boneless sweet and spicy fried chicken and lychee BBT. The chicken had a great crunch and sauce was flavored well, maybe a bit over seasoned. Came with a side of Daikon. Lychee BBT was below par and was made from powder.

Value: chicken was a bit more expensive than other fried chicken places. Portions were good. BBT was expensive. Charged at fresh juice prices but was made from powder."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is amazing !!! Will defiantly return ! Didn't really like the seasoning to the hot pot but was still good !"}
{"text":"Crunchy House has joined us in Crowfoot!  It's in the same plaza where Chianti's and Mucho Burritos are.  The Korean/Vietnamese fusion cuisine is quite neat!  The restaurant is run by a husband & wife team who are, you guessed it, Korean & Vietnamese respectively.  The lady owner is really nice and pleasant.  She is the one that serves you.  Her husband is the chef.

You get the usual Vietnamese appys like spring rolls and shrimp salad rolls and Vietnamese subs with a Korean twist but then you also get Korean dumplings, & fried chicken which is their specialty!  We have not tried their fried chicken but perhaps, next time we will. They also have lunch specials that come with a drink of choice and Bubble Tea.

We ordered the following:
31. Beef Bulgogi & Spring Rolls Vermicelli (Bun) - Nicely done bulgogi beef with your usual bun items like vermicelli, carrots, lettuce, cucumber, bean sprouts.  Nice fish sauce to douse your bun.
32. Korean Spicy Pork & Spring Rolls Vermicelli (Bun) - Love the spicy pork!  Not at all spicy.  Comes with the usual bun items as above in 31.
41. Korean Bibimbap - Rice with beef bulgogi, fried egg, carrot, lettuce, mushroom, cucumber, Korean house special house^ a small soup - this was well-liked.  Not your usual stone-bowl bibimbap but it's still all good. 
58) Fish hot pot - Basa fish, fish ball, tofu, cabbage, daikon, mushroom, onion, celery, bamboo shoot, baby corn served with steam rice.  You can also choose other carbs like instant noodle or vermicelli.  Piping hot pot with a candle lit under the mini wok.  Delicious and tasty.  Ask for hot sauce to eat with your meal.  

They have a nice sit-down restaurant space and there's also take out.  Parking is right out front but it seems to be always busy in that parking lot.  Holiday hours are 12 pm to 8 pm.

We will be back!"}
