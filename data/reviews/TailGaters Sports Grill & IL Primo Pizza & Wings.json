{"text":"I was in here last weekend and had a great time. Good food and cold beer, relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great staff, friendly bartenders, love the atmosphere.  Pizza best in AZ.  Been attending here for close to 4 years.  My favorite place to be."}
{"text":"The food was so good! I had it delivered which came very quickly to which I was really excited about! The delivery guy was super nice and charismatic. My only issue was that they didn't add enough salt for my liking and forgot my second cannoli, but even with that, it was sooooo good! I would totally buy from here again!"}
{"text":"Visiting from San Diego I found this place to be much like a local brewery with a hometown feel. Large drinks and decent food. Wish the Buffalo salad had smaller strips, more sauce and other ingredients...kinda boring. Other than that the Philly was awesome!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place.  We eat here 4-5 times a month.  They have a bunch of stuff on the menu, but we stick with the pizza, wings and beer.  Thier wings are some of the best around.  You can also order them grilled and those are great as well.

Great place to eat and have a few beers.  Prices are good.

A couple of minor things that do bug me about this place.  

They have live music (most always a one man band) on Friday nights that is normally pretty good, but sometimes it's a little too loud even for a sports bar.

If you're not a UFC fan DON'T try to get in this place on a UFC fight night.  The wait can be pretty long."}
{"text":"Bad service. Waited 35 minutes for a baked Italian sandwich and chips. It was the saltiest sandwich I've ever had. It was more like a calzone, not sure why it is listed ad a sandwich."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite and beer.  Nachos were great, wings were pretty good, and the pizza was excellent.  Family friendly, lots of TVs, lots of sports.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The service has gone down the drain lately and I am possibly going to be looking for a new favorite place to order pizza.  I used to bounce back and forth from the competition across the street but decided we like the quality of the food just slightly better.

I never usually right a review but thought I would share my experience.  The issue started several weeks ago and has continued to get worst and worst each week.  To make a long story short, every delivery I have had for the last 3 weeks has been pretty sloppy.  What do I mean, wing sauce spilled in the bag after every delivery and pizza pretty warm instead of being nice and hot.  On the last delivery I was quoted 45 mins to 1 hour for delivery and guess what happen? The pizza showed up and hour and half later.   So the pizza was indeed cold and the wings not worth talking about since they tasted like they were heated up in the microwave.  I called to complain and was very overwhelmed that they would comp my order (nice credit on next order).  I told my wife they just won me back to stay.

Today, we placed and order and tried to let them redeem themselves.  I think they must of had somebody new taking orders or greeting there guest, since I thought it would be faster this time to pick up the order myself since they have been averaging ang hour or more delivery.

I arrived to pick up my order and it wasn't ready, did I get there early nope.  I waited 45 mins before I left to get my order, I forgot to mention they didn't qouted me the time for pickup (first mistake).  Second mistake when I paid in cash at the counter the young lady place my changed on the counter, I was like really. It would of been different if it was place in the little folder they give you pay like there servers do but the counter, c'mon man. Instead of being professional and customer service oriented she should of gave me the money direct.  

Third mistake the lady told me my wings were done but my pizza was coming out in the next few minutes, I waited 15 mins and then they finally told me that my order didn't go thru.  WTF are you kidding me, her excuse was the order didn't show up on the screen in the kitchen.  So when I asked her how could you know what wings I ordered and what additional sauce I wanted then, she had no answer.  So bottom line is I waited another 1 and half to get food when this should of taken 45 mins or so.   Very lousy service!!!"}
{"text":"I love Tailgaters and I love that they deliver. I'm a working mom and my husband works late too so sometimes we have to order in. There is a huge selection so the kids can have what they like and the pizza and wings are good too!"}
{"text":"My 5 star rating is based mostly on the quality of service I received from the bartender. Leslie was amazing!!! Never had to ask for a refill...it just arrived as soon as it was needed. When the wings were unsatisfactory (cold & old) she didn't hesitate to take them away and rush a new order through. As long as Leslie is around I'll be a faithful customer!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good here, don't get me wrong. The service though, it's not the best. I literally had to wait until I was done with my food to get another refill for WATER. The server should be on top of this. I would've asked for another refill but the server was never around. If only the service was better I would've given it 4.5 if possible."}
{"text":"Nice place a little outdated for us, food was good. Over all good place to catch a beer and relax!"}
{"text":"Go there for a good time. Normal people just looking for a good time! Leaving the drama at home. Good food at a good price. Great staff!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  The staff is fantastic and they treat you like family."}
{"text":"Great service! Great variety on menu, and the food is awesme! Nice atmosphere and  overall great place!"}
{"text":"Came in the other day on a Thursday night and it was quite busy. Our waitress seemed kind of out of it and just wasn't too personable. Ordered the boneless wings off the happy hour menu and was very disappointed... they were maybe the size of cottonballs, and only came with 8 for $6!! Not much of a deal on those... And I didn't know \"specialty shots\" came in little to go sauce container cups. Overall the place just had a weird vibe. Won't be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Worst takeout I've had in a while. I couldn't even stomach the 50 dollar meal I bought for my family  that took an hour and a half to get here. Never going back"}
{"text":"What a great experience!!  We have been going here since it opened.  First it was just the guys, now our whole family goes here at least one a week.  Team Trivia is Tuesday nights and is a blast.

Gotta get the bread sticks - buttery, garlic and spices - it's awesome!

The manager Richard is always there and runs a great place."}
{"text":"Omg! Went dine in for wings and found a pubic hair in the wings!  Disgusting disgusting disgusting!!!! Seriously get it together they just lost a customer!!!"}
{"text":"OVER ALL LOVE THIS PLACE.. Best Baked Philly cheese steak Sandwhiches... Always main sporting events on the multiple flat screens they have!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood sports bar. The Potato Skins are incredible.  Wings are really good as well.  Great family atmosphere with a lot of locals.  Staff is friendly and service is expedient."}
{"text":"Showed up for cold wings Wednesday!   The night would have been a disaster if not for Leslie and Charlie making the cold wings tolerable!"}
{"text":"Good cold beer and the wait staff is excellent. The food is solid pub food without frills but fills."}
{"text":"Wings=ON POINT
Pizza=ON POINT
Menu selection=ABUNDANT
Happy Hour=YES PLEASE
Pet Friendly Patio=GOT IT

My visit to IL PRIMO was better than expected.  I have recently began phasing in the keto style diet so the idea of taunting myself by going to a pizzeria was not mine. The place was bustling with Happy Hour patrons as we showed up to be seated about 600 on a Friday, they also had an All You Can Eat Friday Fish Fry going. Inside seating was about a 15min wait but we selected the open seating on the mister equipped patio an seated immediately. Something to consider for those with little ones, being a bar and grill some of the loud conversations you may not be able to avoid will not be suitable for youngsters. We unfortunately sat next to a group that seemed to shout a 2hour expletive filled conversation. It may have been due to the fish fry, happy hour or just our poor choice of day and time to go eat but the service was a tad bit slow, to the point of us thinking our server may have forgotten about us. Drinks ran empty often and silverware arrived about 10 minutes after the food. Enough about that though, the whole reason we came was to eat....on to the food!  The Half size Antipasto salad was delicious, crisp cool lettuce, perfectly ripened tomato and the cold cut meats were deli worthy. The only thing I missed were the peppers.  I can't do the wings justice, you're just going to have to try them yourself.  I had the spicy garlic and honey hot and the were fantastic, Nice crunch to sauce ratio and super meaty.  The wife had the medium on recommend from our server due to the sauce being butter based, the mild would essentially be just butter. She commented that it was the perfect combo of flavor and heat to satisfy the wimpiest of taste buds.  The pizza looked amazing! I didn't have any but the wife again, stated it was the best pizza she has ever eaten."}
{"text":"This place is alright. The magharita pizza was delicious. The overall atmosphere is not bad but not great and it kind of smells weird. Good place for a quick beer and good pizza but don't expect too much more than that."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is relaxed, food is good for bar food and the prices are great. The staff is friendly and attentive. 

Bring the family to watch the game and hang out."}
{"text":"Great place to come with family or friends.  All the staff is friendly and fun to talk to.  You dont feel pressure and overwhelm like most place."}
{"text":"Went there on 3/23/2013 with my wife, saw the review and thought it had to be a slam dunk. The experience consisted of

 slow sloppy service - took over 12 min before someone even came to our table. The waitress gave away my wife's order to someone else so there was a 25 min time difference between my food arriving and  my wife's.

 The food - cold on delivery with the exception of my wife's dinner plate partly  to do with the reason stated above. 

The servers- seemed annoyed with other customers and unapologetic, the server rolled her eyes at a customer that asked for a refill that was sitting adjacent to me. 


What made me write my first neg review ever instead of just telling family and friends not to come to TailGaters Sports Grill - The server spilled beer all over the guy sitting next to us ( an accident I am sure) but when she was cleaning it up the back and fourth moments done by  the rag had some of the beer  splat over me as well with no apology. This is the first time I have never tipped a waitress in my life."}
{"text":"It's a good local sports bar. Tons of TVs affordable pricing. Special large pizza and 10 wings for $20.  30 inch pizza challenge you and a friend 1 hour to finish it or you and 2 friends 30 minutes. It's just a cool local sports bar."}
{"text":"Go to lunch there often.... love setting  in the bar area... the workers are very kind and fun to be around...Nicole has the best personality.... what a blessing .. I'm sure the owners know .. .. PS the food is very good and the beer is cold. :) Polly & Roger Follett."}
{"text":"My daughter had a coupon for this place so we ended up getting 1 -14\" cheese and 1 -14\" sausage pizza for $12.75! My expectations weren't very high at that price but the pizza was really good! We took the pizza out and received little packets of Parmesan and red pepper to sprinkle on top. Yum! The lady that checked us out was friendly and the place  seemed nice inside with lots of seating. (Too bad we were taking it out). Our order was correct and ready to go at the right time. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place could very well be a awesome place. It lacks the serving experience and cooks in the kitchen. On a busy Saturday night it was \"Seat Yourself\" and of course couples were taking up all the 8 seat tables and the waiters are fine with this. The nachos are always over cooked and make sure to order your next beer when you're only halfway done with your first. I keep telling myself maybe it'll be better next time due to all the TVs and fun atmosphere around you. This could have been my last time at this location."}
{"text":"We LOVE tailgaters! this is definitely our spot to go! Everything on there menu is great.. but they have EXCEPTIONAL Pizza and Wings(honey BBQ wings are the best!)!!! This place is definitely family friendly and their servers are great! Team trivia is always fun on Wednesday's & Saturdays or just to watch a game!"}
{"text":"My wife is vegan and finding good Pizza that is dairy free can be difficult.  The manager at this location insists that the pizza crust is vegan.  The crust and sauce are great and we order carryouy Nd delivery all the time.  My wife loves to get a peppercini pizza without cheese.

Lastly, the pizza prices are reasonable (under 17 bucks for two) when utilizing one of their great coupons."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. I haven't had anything that I didn't like! They take pride in making the customer happy, I wasn't delivered a salad I ordered and they fixed it immediately and took money off of my bill for the mistake. It definitely made me feel that they cared about me!"}
{"text":"So I've been here about 5 times now, and I can honestly say it's a cool place to hang out at. The servers are nice as well as the bartenders. The food is good as well. I've had pizza their hot wings and last Friday a calzone. They have a good happy hour with different food specials everyday which is also cool.
 Went there last week to see the MMA fights which was free no cover charge, that was nice. There always seems to be a good crowd in there also, and being that I'm usually sitting at the bar. I really appreciate the fact that the bartenders don't ask you to close out after they're shift ends. That's a big plus. Starting to become a regular here which is a good thing."}
{"text":"CONSISTENT!!!!! that's the best word for Tailgaters. Good food pizza, wings, subs, burgers and cold beer (which in PHX area isn't always the case!). As a person who grew up on the east coast, I am forever searching for my hometown bar. If I had to call it......this is it. Steady group of regulars day and night with a good local bar feel."}
{"text":"Great CHEESE CURDS and good service. Good place to watch the UFC fight not over crowded."}
{"text":"I love this place ! We went for trivia night and the food and service were both great.Out server \"Charly\" was professional and attentive.Keep up the good work ! We will be back."}
{"text":"I actually go to this place every once in a while. The food is very good, which I will get to later in this review. The reason for the poor rating started as soon as I walked in. Walking through the door I saw the \"wait to be seated\" sign. Not a problem, except not a single person who worked there greeted me or my friend...not even a hello. More than 5 of the wait staff walked by as we stood there, many of them multiple times, and that included the staff at the registers for takeout which is right next to the door.... no one said a single word for about 5 minutes. I enjoy the food there, so we stuck it out, standing there awkwardly. Finally one of the staff came over, said one moment, and we were seated. After being seated, we mine as well have been invisible again. I guess no-one was assigned to the table, or they were busy, it wasn't until another 10 minutes or so when someone came over and asked if we had been helped...we hadn't. She came back, took our order, and thats when things finally went normal. 

I ordered the chili cheese hotdog and a side of meatballs, and my friend ordered the bratwurst and a side of meatballs (their meatballs are amazing...just saying). We split the hot dog and brat so we could try them both. The Brat had a lot of flavor and was very tasty. The hot dog was ok, the chili was very thick but not much on there, so it was very close to being beans and meat on the hot dog with some shredded cheese. It tasted alright. The meatballs, however, are were its at. They do have really good food, and the meatballs are no exception. Just try them as a side, you get 2, covered in marinara and cheese, and they are delightful. Those and their fries, which are breaded, are super tasty. 

The service was normal after being ignored for the first 15-20 minutes of being there, and everyone is always really friendly. My low rating is only because it isn't the only time were I was either ignored, or not greeted for a while waiting. Which is odd since the staff are actually really nice and friendly and do provide good service when they notice you. I will still go back because the food is really good (I have had many items on the menu), but you may find yourself waiting a bit before someone even says hello. But man....those meatballs are worth it. I'll update this review next time I go back, and we will see what happens."}
{"text":"Finally decided to give it a try last night, and it is without regrets that we did.  I will say this... the wings and pizza were greasier than they needed to be, but good flavor was certainly found.  Plenty of TV's to watch your various flavors of sporting events and such.  Seem to have good happy hour and weekly specials.  We will come back again!"}
{"text":"Showed up on a Wednesday night for trivia, because, according to their website AND in-restaurant marketing, they do trivia on Wednesdays at 7.  Nope. Apparently they've moved it to Tuesday like every other bar ever and didn't think of updating their website or in-store marketing. Very disappointing. 

Had a half order or nachos which were good. $6 on happy hour. Beer selection was solid- a lot of different varieties including local beer. Not disappointed by that. Also got a pizza and wings to go once we were told that trivia wasn't happening. They were good. Food gets 4-ish stars. Lack of communication brings this place down to 3."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and cold beer. Specials are always nice and a great place to watch any sporting game on the several tvs they have. Crowd gets into it.  Pizza is OK kind of average but the wings are excellent. Especially if you order them crispy and sloppy."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times due to the fact that its near my house and kitchen closes really late.

Service can be a more of a miss than a hit. Some days they are constantly looking out to refill your glass with your favorite drink (Four Peaks- Kilt Lifter on tap)  and other days they forget you exist.  

Place is very chill/relaxed, good place to watch sports.

So far I've only had their Pizza. I love that they are not stingy with their vegetables you ask for bell peppers, onions, mushroom etc. and you can actually see them."}
{"text":"If I could I wouldn't give them any stars. The waitress was awful. She was snippy had to ask her to clear plates  she told me after they didn't have any more plates that's why she didn't clear them.  In case you are wondering who she was. She was the only one pregnant.  Will not go back. Pizza was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Pizzas have shrunk in size dramatically since they have opened, and are pretty tasteless in my opinion. I prefer Little Caesars pizza over this place if that says anything. My pepperoni pizza tasted like a grease pizza with cheese that was not completely melted. The wings aren't too bad, they are the only reason this joint received any stars."}
{"text":"Our favorite close to home spot for take out, and for watching games. The wings are great, better than the \"other\" sports establishment. Plus the cheese curds and pizza is pretty good as well.

I do however agree with the other reviews about the service being hit or miss, but overall it's pretty decent."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat, great local bar.  It's not everyday you find a place where the managers come over and interact with your kids. Great service even better staff."}
{"text":"This is our new Place, we go every Wed for great food and Team Trivia. All servers and fantastic and by your second time visiting tailgaters you feel like a friend. Some of my favorite menu items are the pizza and wings (hot honey)  of course but also the French dip and Philly cheese steak are great! come visit this friendly place for a drink and have some great food. you won't regret it"}
{"text":"I have lived really close to this place for years but didn't try it until last week. I always thought it was like a pizza hut...limited menu of mediocre pizza and slimy wings but with beer. Turns out I was wrong...it's a really fun sports bar with a wide array of bar-type food and a great drink selection. They even have NTN trivia if you're into that. The day we were there, the Three Olives girls were walking around giving out free 'Dew\" shots, which was a nice bonus. We had pizza and wings and while the pizza wasn't the most amazing pizza I've ever had, it was quite enjoyable. And the wings were really good too, nothing like Pizza Hut's. They had a ton of other things I'd like to try someday too...salads, countless appetizers, sandwiches, calzones....something for everyone."}
{"text":"Took the kids here for dinner tonight because the last time my hubby and I went it was very good. Tonight both Burgers were very over cooked, we ordered both of them medium and they came out super well done! Both kids grilled cheese where over cooked on the outside and still cold in the middle and the tater tots where over cooked. The homemade chips well yes you guessed it way over done. I felt like we were eating burnt grease! After spending over $60 for 4 people to eat it was definitely not worth it. Don't think I will go back there."}
{"text":"This place has good food especially the pizza 
I've been here three times and have not been disappointed.
The service is great always friendly"}
{"text":"The food is pretty darn good ...the waitress...slower than molasses...it shouldnt take 10 mins to get a beer we ordered. This happened continuosly with our order all night...sorry...you just lost your tip."}
{"text":"I actually heard of this place from a friend , but was completely blown away with how delicious their food really was . First of all this is the perfect place to watch sports!!! The atmosphere is just right , make sure if it's a big game to get there early!! It's a busy place ! I've only had their pizza and wings !!! And I was not disappointed plus their fried zucchini is perfect !!!! 
The prices are reasonable they always have some type of specials going on !"}
{"text":"I am severely disappointed with this restuarant. I wish I would have looked at these reviews before going. I ordered the 5 piece boneless wings and two slices of pizza. The boneless wings were 5.99 so i figure over a dollar a wing, the wings would be large. The wings were literally the size of a quarter. The pizza was mediocre. I am SO disappointed esp. with the wings.."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza, wings, and potato skins, the skins are burnt to a crisp. I order from here a lot and I am extremely disappointed today. I cannot believe any cook would put these potato skins out. Completely disgusted."}
{"text":"2nd time here.. The staff is friendly and fast. The food is delicious. They have a little bit of everything from subs, burgers, to pizza.  
We got the bacon/pepperoni with wings and mozzarella sticks. The sticks were alright. Not too much flavor though. It's clean inside, spacious, and T.V.s on the walls. With 2 arcade games for the kids. I definitely recommended stopping by for lunch. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Shards of glass in their draft beers. Don't go here. $10 gift card. Calling the health department on these motherfuckers."}
{"text":"Went in at around 2 pm on a Sunday. Not too busy. Music was kinda loud, dark atmosphere, Tvs loud. Waited for several minutes for someone to acknowledge that we were sitting down, because the sign at the door said please seat yourself. A waitress and a manager passed by neither said hi, went to try and fix a tv that wasn't working. So we left. Won't be back! First impressions are lasting impressions"}
{"text":"The more I look around, the more I notice TailGaters. There are multiple locations around the west valley and I wrote a review of the one located in Prescott, AZ. After multiple visits to the TailGaters in Litchfield Park, I decided to Yelp! about it.

I've visited here many times over the last few years with my girlfriend. Sometimes it's a quick bite. Other times it was to catch a game. Tonight, we grabbed dinner with family. First observation, TailGaters is consistently fun.

The beer selection is better than most bars. There are more than a few of my favorites on draft, from Killian's to some local crafts from San Tan and Four Peaks. There are plenty of televisions too! So many in fact that often, the same game is on three monitors in your view. And there is the atmosphere. This location always has a good crowd of fans on hand, cheering and booing with the action.

The food is also better than most bars. It's not elevated or fancy. But some things are creative, like my Baked Reuben. All in all, the food is simply cooked well.

From the always impressive service, to the good overall experiences, TailGaters is a solid little neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"This place is the best, a bar that can actually make a damn good ild fashioned.Not to mention the baked subs are to die for.And the waitresses are super cute."}
{"text":"I ended on this side of town for all the wrong reasons that doesn't need explaining.
However, this place while being a dive bar, and not the most healthy menu had great wings.
Got salt and pepper wings and garlic Parmesan, excellent. So if I ever end up on around this part of town for some reason, I will come back to this spot."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Been here about 6x and the waitress are very nice  and the food is amazing. Not one complaint about the food.. kudos to the chief.."}
{"text":"Had another great experience with Derrick! He ran the entire bar with a smile and he was Johnny on the spot with cold beers without even having to ask for another. He is very observant and professional! Thank you for another great experience! BTW.... the pizza was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Tailgaters is a large restaurant, with a good separations for groups or gatherings, with a nice outdoor seating area with a propane fire-pit and patio seating (when its not 110).

The menu at Tailgaters Sports Grill & Il Primo Pizza & Wings is large with great selection to accomadate everyone's taste. Tailgaters offers daily food specials which are great wallet friendly deals. The menu at Tailgaters  has a lot of variety for a sports bar, and everything I've had there has been really good. The club sandwich is loaded, tasty, and one of my favorites and the burgers are tasty as well."}
{"text":"Stopped here to have lunch and watch the game. Place was uncrowded, but it took a while to get MY game on, which was done cheerfully. Settled on the Calzone. Not the best, but not bad either.
Some favorable things:
Free WiFi
1.50 Bud drafts
Daily Specials
2 for $5 brats
Friendly service
Pretty good selection of pub grub (nachos, wings, burgers, etc.)

A bad thing:
Service seemed a bit slow despite being uncrowded

All in all, I'll eat there again.

p.s. After I arrived, about 8-10 Maricopa county deputys came in to eat.. Read whatever you want into that."}
{"text":"Really nice family friendly sports bar. Inside and outside dining with TV's everywhere. Beautiful bar with all your favorite libations. And COLD beer. Good selection of drafts complemented by an impressive selection of bottled brews.. service was fast and friendly. Great selection of pub food. Had a baked Ruben. The bread was replaced with pizza dough wrapped around the meats etc. Awesome. Wife had boneless wings and loaded totts. Everything was excellent. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy the fun atmosphere at Tailgators and enjoy Trivia night! I just would recommend less TV's and more Interactiveness. Unfortunately LP is missing that and you guys have what it takes to make it work! Karaoke on Fridays! I would be there every week and help grow your crowd cuz I just...can :) we are wanting and waiting...make it worth out while!"}
{"text":"Went here for my 20th birthday and it was amazing. Nothing better then pizza and wings for dinner!!! Food was amazing but I didn't give it 5 stars because our server was \"decent\" we got two big pizza's and 60 wings and she only brought us 4 ranches then we asked for more ranches and she only brought out two more... I felt like a bother to keep on asking for ranch and she only brings us one or 2 every time when we're a big party! I know it's something little and dumb to complain about but it really got annoying."}
{"text":"Although the wait was a bit longer than I would expect, it was worth it! Fresh cooked wings and pizza in this place was very appreciated! Yum."}
{"text":"Just moved to town, this place I really like. Their drink prices are great, the burgers are delicious. Fries are good too!

There are plenty of TVs and I would imagine it's a fun place to be for a sporting event. Haven't attended one there yet.  

It's the perfect place for bar type food and super reasonably priced drinks. Thumbs up!   I prefer Tailgaters over places like Chili's or TGI Friday's and it's family friendly.

The ONLY reason I didn't do five stars is because it isn't that kind of place, it's casual...very casual."}
{"text":"Pretty good!  Came here for the first time to grab some pizza and wings for the game.

$37 for 30 wings and a medium pepperoni pizza, not bad at all.  

The wings were OK.  Average wings overall.  Decent amount of sauce and good amount of chicken.  

The pizza was pretty good.  It was slightly cold but that was my fault picking it up a little late.

I plan on returning"}
{"text":"After spending so much time at the Tailgaters on Bell Rd, this place falls short in my opinion.  The layout is atrocious.   The bar area is tiny and packed constantly.  The dining area is one long open area and its always seems crowded.  

I've been here a few times and left dissatisfied.   I will say the last time I went the experience was better.  Our waitress was great.   The food came out as ordered and she ensured we had the little things like sides of ranch or blue cheese with our meal and we didn't have to ask for them again.  

The beer was cold and on the money.  We have friends that swear by this location so we will definately be back to give it another shot.   The food, this last time, was very similar to the Bell location which was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Best local pizza! Just order the Cheeseburger Pizza with bacon. Delicious! Seriously. The wings aren't bad, not a bad beer selection. We go for games and sometimes Trivia night on Wednesday. Service is so, so but a couple if the waitresses are awesome. Might need more staff on busy nights."}
{"text":"Their food is OK.  The atmosphere is OK.  But the staff makes this establishment unvisitable.  I've talked about it before above, but I decided to give them another shot this afternoon.  I've lowered their score to one star.

Called ~2:45 to place a pick up order.  Was greeted kindly by a very nice woman, then immediately put on hold when I asked if I could make an order for pickup.  After four minutes, I hung up and called back.  Same thing, immediately put on hold.

Look - it's 3PM on a Friday - why are you putting people on hold to take orders?  Why are they being left on hold for multiple minutes?  You are not busy, I just drove by and checked on my way to pick up food from an establishment that doesn't make me wait or forget critical parts of the order.  

There's plenty of staff standing around as well.

Why is anyone answering the phone (the delivery number) if they aren't ready to take an order then and now?  I could understand if it was prime time weekend/evening.  Or a holiday.  But it's not.  

Won't be trying again, sorry, but my tolerance for inept management is zero."}
{"text":"Three of us tried this place for dinner today.  Not bad at all for a wing joint.  We had the one of the pizza/wing specials (30 Wings and 1 XL pizza with 1 top).  They let us split the wings..  10 HOT, 10 medium, and 10 mild.  We ordered a pepperoni for the 1 item.  The service was great.  The waiters came be a lot to check on us.  

Wings were saucy and still crispy!  Pizza was thin and cheesy!  Everything was good...  The price on the drinks are not bad either.. Lot of TVs, so many things to watch.  Yeah, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome in every way for a sports bar...good food...good service...good prices

{"text":"my wife and I have been coming here for years. today we went with friends. maybe three tables seated and we had to wait a long time for service. when our drink order finally came we had to wait forever to place a food order. in the past the pizza was good, today it seemed like frozen pizza. the crust was like cardboard and it was slightly burned.  the wings were good though."}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss. Lots of tvs and is a great place to watch sporting events, everyone is friendly, and it is usually quite busy. Wings are great, pizza is great, there is a bloody mary bar that I love!"}
{"text":"Delivery was super fast and food was good (turkey/avocado wrap & blt). Will definitely order there again."}
{"text":"The best! Happy hour m-f from 1030am to 7? Thats crazy! 2.00 drafts! Specials everyday. All sports on all the time! FOOD IS THE BEST!"}
{"text":"So it's seat yourself witch we did & it took about 30mins to a hour for a server to even notice us . I do love the food but service was not all there"}
{"text":"I read a review that their Philly cheesesteak was similar to Chicago's style... I highly disagree! The hotdog that my toddler ate was disgusting. The potato skins were ok. Although, the suicide wings were great. (but the hotness was more of a medium heat not suicide) The service was extremely slow but friendly staff. I don't see myself dining in but maybe I will do a take out on wings and try their pizza."}
{"text":"Good pizza and wings.  Just have to be super clear on any special requests.  Like extra sauce on side plus regular sauce on wings for example."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here regularly for wings and french fries for well over a year. I'm not a huge fan of wings, but here, they're delicious! The fries and cheese curds are also great.

Occasionally, we've ventured out from our typical order, but have been disappointed every time. I particularly don't care for the pizzas or calzones, as their sausage tastes like it's of the frozen pizza variety, and the veggies don't get sufficiently cooked in whatever baking method they use.

Service and quality of food preparation is somewhat inconsistent, but hey - ish happens sometimes, right?"}
{"text":"So... We were in need of some serious sustenance and ordered your food for delivery. It was just not good, not terrible, but not good. The fries tasted as though they were reheated from days prior and what I thought was a baked sandwich really was buffalo chicken in a bread log. Oh and you forgot the honey mustard."}
{"text":"Food was good! Atmosphere was perfect, had god service and didn't feel forgotten. Manager even helped to take our finished baskets away. Even commented on a \"go Cubs\" cuz my friends were wearing Cubs hats!"}
{"text":"Wish I could have tried the pizza, unfortunately the bartender told me it was last call and that they had closed the kitchen already when I arrived a few minutes after 1am. I called before I showed up to be sure I could order food and the woman on the phone encouraged me to come in and that they served fried food and pizza until 1:30am. I also checked the menu online and it stated the same thing. So thanks for that."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Tailgaters. Whether it's the one on Dysart or the one on Bell but their hot wings are delicious. I've never had an issue when it came to eating here. The pizza leave some to be desired because it's not great but I never go there for the pizza anyways. Usually it's just hot wings and maybe something to wash it down with. The servers are usually great and very courteous. The restaurants during the day are nice enough to take the family."}
{"text":"Such a fan of Tailgaters! I come here every Tuesday with my parents and grandma for trivia night.  Always such a fun time.  The food, especially the pizza is really good.  Service is great too, if you're in the mood for a burger, beer and a good time Tailgaters won't let you down."}
{"text":"This was the best pizza we've had in a long time! Loved that you can pick your favorite type of wings too (drums or flat) for a minimal upcharge. I ordered online, and would suggest a comment box, like if you like your pizza crust crispy, etc. but the order was delivered quickly and by a very courteous driver.  We've found a gem in pizza delivery.. thank you Il Primo..delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is so chill. You can sit wherever you want and the Baked SUBS ARE THE BOMB!! The customer service is GREAT and I LoVe how the GM goes around and asks how everything is going and then hands out his cards for the new location opening up on Reems Rd. Thanks for delivering a great lunch/dinner, every single time!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here on a Saturday night, after unsuccessful attempts at other nearby places, hoping to play some Buzztime trivia.  We were pleasantly surprised!  A full menu, lots of televisions, great service, and very decently priced drinks.  I can't give five stars because we didn't eat... but we most certainly will be back!"}
{"text":"Went earlier today, to watch a game and wasn't really impressed. Cheap, good prices, but you get what you paid for - the food was very...bland and service wasn't great."}
{"text":"Good food and great beers. Fantastic environment to catch sporting events. I like this place and will be back. Oh and the wings are great!"}
{"text":"Tried the place two other times and it was an alright experience.  The draft beers are limited, but cheap.  The third time I tried it was for Monday night foot ball. There was no where to sit at the bar, and the round tables were full up. I asked the waitress if I could sit outside on the patio and watch the game, and would someone be out to serve me. She replied yes, so I proceeded to go sit outside and wait for service. It never came, the patio is where smokers go to kill their lungs and two gentlemen came out and lit up and he hacked like he was dying the whole time I was out there. I couldn't take anymore of his death cough, and I was thirsty so I headed back in to scope out service and a seat. The bar was still full, but a round table was avail so I snatched it. The bartender asked if I was expecting anyone I said not at the moment, she was more concerned about me taking up a round table and asked if a seat became available would I mind moving. I said sure.  The beers were coming at a steady rate, but then the bartender asked if I would move in between to large males at the bar, because the two gentlemen from the patio where one was dying from coughing were waiting for my round table. I told her I'm not moving in between two silver back gorilla's because I'm not a small person myself, over 6 feet and 200 pounds of american male.  seemed disgusted and directed the smokers to another table.

That pissed me off, but what really caught my interest was the manager I didn't catch his name, but he has a long pony tail. I saw him come around to our side of the bar, and do a shot of alcohol with a patron that was at the bar.  I get doing shots with friends, but not when you are the manager and it's a full house, drink after work.
My girlfriend showed up, ordered a water with lemon, the waitress brought her a water with no lemon. We quickly paid our tab and headed over to Game Time. Beer didn't taste like the lines have never been flushed and they were larger glasses.
Sorry tail gators I'm not bringing my money or my friends to party there anymore.
the manager should be busted down to a dishwasher for drinking shots while on the clock."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here every Thursday for Thursday Night Football. Being originally from Illinois, we naturally love cheese curds and these are great! My husband loves the wings and I usually try something different every time. White pizza with chicken = delicious. We recommend TailGaters!"}
{"text":"If you want bland, tasteless pizza, then this is the place for you! 

Cheez-whiz on a saltine is gourmet compared to this grease bath on cardboard."}
{"text":"I have been here 5 times in the last two weeks (and ordered 30 wings each time)which is dumb of me after the first time, but I will not be coming back again they have failed to get my order correct one again they evidently do not know what sloppy wings are. The customer service is also horrible I stood there for about 5 minutes before being acknowledged and another 5 before the incompetent staff came to assist me. They have lost a valued customer I will either travel across the street or the extra couple miles to El mirage when we need a hot wing fix."}
{"text":"We get the pizza a lot,but take-out,so I can't review the restaurant. The people are really nice. The pizza is always good and loaded with toppings. And the price is so reasonable. We'll get a delivered pizza from somewhere else,and they are never as good and always way more money. So it's worth the drive for us to go get one. This place is my favorite pizza place!!"}
{"text":"Service is hit and miss.  Usually hit, but sometimes a miss.  

I found it partly annoying and partly humorous that I order another beer, and after 15 minutes, the excuse from my server is that \"she rang it in, and the bartender hasn't gotten around to it yet, so she can't do anything about it\".  

Guys, I don't give a sh-wit about how your systems work. Sitting while food in front of me gets cold waiting for something to wash it down dilutes the experience.  

If a bartender can't appropriate a draft beer in 15 minutes, the manager should reorganize the 3 girls in the hostess stand by the entrance to go bar-back for a few minutes and get the place caught up.  It was a Tuesday night.  Not exactly a door buster of a night.

At least the upsell isn't pressure.  Our server otherwise was professional, friendly and was polite.  The food is in the middle - neither splendid or rancid.  I might come back, but another experience like this leaves me no option but to never return again."}
{"text":"They have a very expansive menu so there is something for everyone. We came here twice while on a family vacation over spring break. The first time we ordered to go and the food was ready by the time I got there. We had wings, pizza, sandwiches, and salad. All were good.

The next time we went in and were seated right away. My daughter tried one of the baked sandwiches. It is kind of like a calzone but with different stuffings. She had the french dip. She really enjoyed it and has been searching for it on menus ever since. 

Everyone enjoyed their meals. We will definitely visit again if we are ever back in the area."}
{"text":"The wings are amazing love the sauce. Ordered sausage and mushroom pizza it was so fresh and tasty. Best place for pizza and wings hands down! The customer service was awesome."}
{"text":"I wanted mozzarella sticks and potato skins recently. Not many places have both, but Tailgaters does! Ordered a side of meatballs to round out the meal and oh man were they good! Super tasty. I could eat a whole plate of those meatballs. The potato skins were also yummy. The mozza stix were nothing special (like your average frozen cheese sticks), but I still like them. I need to come back for more meatballs and other tasty appetizers. :)"}
{"text":"Came here for UFC fights, and were barely able to get a seat!

We ended up ordering food to go, and eating right in our laps, but it was totally fine. They are insanely well staffed, and still even brought beer to us even though we weren't officially at a table. 

Pizzas here were delicious. I can't vouch for anything else but everything looked pretty good that whizzed by us :) Prices were amazing too, although I forgot that we were in Arizona :P"}
{"text":"What can I say? They've got decent food, a solid selection of beers, Buzztime Trivia, a lot of TVs and the staff is very friendly. Though they brag about their pizza - which is good - the Chicago snob in me doesn't think it's *that* good. Tailgaters certainly is my bar of choice - you know, when the family life doesn't get in the way."}
{"text":"Love the food, but dont order anything that can fall on the floor and be thrown onto a plate. 
As a previous employee I saw it happen A LOT. If a wing falls on the ground, do you really think the cook is going to cook another batch of wings? No! They'd just throw it right back on the pile and send it out the window because when the cooks there hit a rush it is stressful.
I'd recommend if you want to ensure you're getting quality food, DON'T go in when there is a huge crowd and a line of orders waiting. 
Great food, but sketchy during a rush."}
{"text":"This place is huge with giant T.V. screens everywhere. Great place to watch a game. Pretty good pizza and wings too. Great service as well."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's great sometimes not so much. Guess it depends on who's cooking. We don't even bother getting delivery from this place anymore. We would always get delivery I'd say at least once a month for about 2+ years then all of a sudden couldn't find our house anymore. We don't live in a remote area just a normal community right near Dysart and Indian School. Always tipped $5-$10 bucks each time so not like we were stiffing the delivery driver either."}
{"text":"Love that they deliver anything on their menu...great when not in the mood for pizza.  Their food is great and delivery is fast"}
{"text":"After ordering the food took too long, waitress forgot the drink and was MIA for at least 30 min.  Service was shit and she still added gratuity.  First time here and definitely the last."}
{"text":"Pretty bummed and disappointed tonight. Family orders food spending around 50 bucks. The sampler wasn't what we ordered. The sliders were just plain meat cheese and bun. But these wings... There's barely even meat on it. Looks like someone took a bit out of one of them. Not sure if I will return to this location."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I can actually taste the Crown in my Coke! We love this place."}
{"text":"I got dreadfully ill eating here.  Also the beer tastes like they don't clean the lines.
I went there on 4-10-2017. I ordered the mac and cheese with chicken to go. I got home at 630 pm and ate.  At 830 pm I became violently ill.  This continued until 145am next morning. I vomited for over 5 hours.  It was so bad I could not stand.  At 6am the pain became manageable.  I almost had to go to the ER.  I had to call out sick today because of the body aches, chills, fever and no sleep.  That's 8 hours of sick time gone. 

Last time I had a case of food poisoning like this was back in 2000.

I reported this to the AZ health dept.  I also kept left overs of the dish.

After they confirm that it was this meal that got me so ill,  I am calling a lawyer.

I went through almost 24 hours of torture, pain, and suffering.  And then on top of that I had to use 8 of my sick hours."}
