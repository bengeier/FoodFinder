{"text":"Just had brunch here. Walked in and was not greeted for several minutes although there were three open tables. My boyfriend and I ordered the smoked trout dish, priced at 17 dollars. When it arrived, it was very small. It was small enough to prompt me to write this review, as usually I wouldn't. the food was okay, but absolutely not worth 17 dollars. There were 3 tiny tiny strips of fish and a small pile of asparagus. When I wanted to pay, the servers ignored us and did not bring the bill until they were done their conversation. Underwhelming, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Fiorentina is without a doubt the best restaurant on the Danforth.  What Chefs Alex and Tina do with locally sourced food is brilliant.  Their brunches are deservedly famous - and so should be their dinners.  Their standards such as their charcuterie plate and beef tartar (rivals what you'd get in France) are consistently delicious.  Most of the items on the dinner menu change each week.  If you haven't been, you need to try it."}
{"text":"Great place, very cool and some amazing food offerings. We had a cold pickerel dish that was insanely delicious, so fresh and delicately flavoured!  I had an omelette that was regrettably wayyy over seasoned and the saltiness was painful. The other dishes we had, including bennies, were perfect."}
{"text":"Brunch menu is average. They charged me for 2 coffees when I asked for a refill on my first coffee. The potatoe salad which they serve as a side is really not tasty. Will not be returning again."}
{"text":"This place just opened but was previously opened at another location on the danforth. I walked in around 11am and the place was not very busy so I was told to take a seat of my choice. The waitress arrived very promptly to take my order. I ordered a latte and waited for my friend before ordering lunch.  I was served with water and my latte very quickly. Service here is excellent. For lunch I noticed that other people had ordered the quiche. It came with a serving of salad. The quiche was so succulent , to die for. The salad was fresh and tasty - just the right amount of dressing.  The bill came to $18 approx.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. The only problem is the minimal seating... We got the Eggs Benny w/ duck, brioche french toast w/rhibarb, and carrot & orange soup.  All of it was top notch. Even the greens' salad that came with the benny was perfect.   I sure hope they can expand some. More seats will be filled in a heartbeat. It's such a hidden gem!  And I didn't even try the mouth-watering sweets! Am I self-disciplined or what?!?"}
{"text":"We discovered this place after our last brunch place, La Neuf, closed. My wife loved their Croque Madam which this place has mastered. I love the French toast but even more so the pancakes. The menu changes weekly so for me it's one or the other. Their omelettes are a work of art - simple, nothing pretentious and not a burn mark / browning as so many expect to see! Cooked to perfection with a great balance of filling. It's the goldilocks of omelettes which many pricier places can't match.   The service prevents me giving a 5 star. Unless you're a regular (I've only been 6 times to this place so far) prepare to be ignored or seated after many others. The waitress will spend a long time ignoring you when all you want is to pay and leave while they talk to their friends or stand behind the counter ignoring you.  I watched as two tables pushed together as one person was seated while  waiting for the rest of the guests while others who are ready simply dismissed. Or another time three sets of doubles tables were free, another couple arrived after us and was seated in the middle table while our party of three were kept waiting? My niece could have solved that math problem when she was five. They don't take reservations. It makes absolutely no sense and if it weren't for the amazing food I wouldn't bother."}
{"text":"There's no need to give directions to Cafe Fiorentina, because the smell of fresh seasonal ingredients, mixed with baked Italian bread, and a small hint of espresso, will lure you in from about half a block away.   I didn't even need to look at the menu when I came here for brunch; that authentic Italian olive oiley smell hit me from outside and as soon as I took one quick look in the door at their cramped-but-cutely-designed interior I knew I was in for a treat.  This place is tiny. At a quick glance, I'd say it seats less than thirty people. Get here early if you want to get a comfortable spot for brunch. If you choose to wait in line for a while however, you'll be pleasantly distracted by a range of magazines, cookbooks, a vast choice of teas, as well as - of course - their freshly baked goods and freshly prepared paninis, seated underneath their handwritten menu board.  The server was knowledgeable and friendly and did a great job at co-ordinating seating all the people who were waiting in line, ensuring those who arrived first got seated first (not as easy as it sounds!!) He answered some questions I had about the menu in a very thorough way, and he happily translated into plain English what some of the fancier sounding ingredients actually were!  The menu changes weekly, so I won't waste time discussing specifically what was on offer when I visited. Expect traditional Italian paninis and baked items with a hint of originality, often supplemented by French or Mexican ingredients. Some staple Canadian brunch items are also occasionally on offer, such as French toast with maple syrup and other entrées such as mac and cheese and yoghurt granola.    I had a panini with eggplant and olive tapenade during my visit, and it was outstanding. The crispiness and freshness of the panini was exquisite and the balance of the powerful ingredients - which admittedly made me a bit suspect at first - was perfect. I didn't try their espresso that day, but look forward to sampling it soon as there was another long line of customers there solely for take-out coffee - it must be good!  Prices very reasonable for the location and the quality.  The best thing about this place, however, is their boston creme dooghnut. Try it. You'll never go back to Timmie's again.  I cannot wait for my next visit here."}
{"text":"After moving into a new apartment, I was not in a position to put together a brunch worthy enough of recuperating my weary (read: non existent) muscles. Thus on my exploration of the neighbourhood I uncovered this amazing Danforth Gem.  Everything is made fresh, quaint and comfortable cafe-table decor -- this place seems to fly under the radar making for a very peaceful breakfast. Food was excellent, very flavourful, and came within a reasonable amount of time from ordering. You can tell they use excellent quality ingredients but portions were just OK.  About half of the customers come for take-away coffees and treats (fresh -as in still-warm-from-the-oven- lemon pudding stuffed doughnuts are a steal at $2.50).  The con to this is the sit-in customers (like me!) lose their server for an inordinate amount of time - terrible when this corresponds with a sudden thirst for a water or latte re-fill.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I work 1 minute from here and live 10 minutes away.  Yet here I am writing my first review of Cafe Fiorentina despite seeing the rave reviews for months.  My first visit did not disappoint.  It's a cozy cafe, quiet and relaxed with a baked-goods counter, good coffee selection and a chalk-board menu behind the cash.  As other Yelpers have said, they change their menu often and I was a little bummed that eggs benny didn't make the cut today (so I'll be back...).  My wife had the quiche of the day with cheddar, mushrooms and spring onions.  It was really good, very light and fluffy yet rich with that french influence.  I had a pulled pork shoulder panini that was fantastic.  It was rich, subtly flavored with the most incredible crunch on the bread.  I literally looked forward to each bite.  I had a sparkling lemonade with mulled mint as a my refreshing beverage and my wife had a cappuccino.  Everything was very good.  I thought service was very good especially considering it was lunch and they have one person serving and doing cash.  With tax and tip I think we paid about $38.  This is another place that I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Brunch never felt so right. My selections included the quiche special and some donuts to go. The pumpkin cream they inject into the donut was life-changing. I'll be back to buy them out of all their Boston Cream."}
{"text":"Nice, cozy environment. The food was great. They were very accommodating as we had two babies with us. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Such a great spot for brunch on the Danforth. The quiche was to die for!! The crust was buttery & flaky, not at all soggy. And the filling was velvety and light. Definitely will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 11:30am Friday for lunch with old neighbour. Have past this place so many times and always skips my memory when looking for lunch spot. Didn't today. The order :  Panini.  Mushrooms arugula cheese and walnuts with salsa verde. On wonderful homemade bread.  Only complaint. Wish there was more.   Orzo with chèvre.  Excellent. Description should say dill also. That was the overwhelming flavour. I loved it my lunch companion not so much. But she doesn't like dill  Mac n cheese.  Creamy cheesy goodness.  Excellent comfort food on Cold day. Comes with a micro green salad.  Needed a bit more dressing.   Take out quiche. Not eaten yet but looks delicious.    (Just tried quiche.  Very Eggie didn't get any flavour of Brie. Or sweet potato etc.   Crust wonderful. But all egg taste.  Needs salt.  Those eggs are so wonderful.  But needs a more sharp cheese or salty Ham.   Creme brûlée  perfection.    Now to Troy our server.  Not very warm at the beginning.  No direction on menu or that general excitement servers get for customers.  He actually was standing at cash when I said we were ready and no intention of coming to table until I asked him.    Now I did notice after that everyone was ordering at cash, paying then sitting down.  We didn't know it worked that way.   On a good note. He did warm up to us and was efficient. Troy. Put a smile on ur face goes a long way.  And a little advice from an old fart who used to be in the service industry when she was young :  don't put my takeout container of quiche on that small table while we are halfway thru lunch.   $47. And Troy got a $10 tip.  I always tip no matter what. I know this is their main source of income. Just some constructive criticism   Would love to now try the dinner and brunch.  Fresh local ingredients just taste sooo good !"}
{"text":"Was walking by on a Sunday morning and smelled this place as I walked by. I walked in and had an amazing morning experience. It filled up very quickly but I know why. Great little gem on danforth worth the visit."}
{"text":"This place has the best Quiche I have ever tasted. Best, ever. Light and delicious. The food here on a whole is delicious and so very homemade, if your home includes two Michelin-eaque French chefs. But really I mean homemade in that the menu changes every week and you can tell it's all done with love and on a somewhat small scale considering it's apparently been around for a while. Lovely neighborhood café. I recommend everything but especially the Quiche!  Oh, and it can take a while from ordering to sitting so maybe be prepared for that. And as others have mentioned, seating is minimal. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Sadly, service does not seem to be of major importance to fiorentina.   I can stand slow service,  I get good food often takes time and I appreciate this; but I can't stand slow, and snippy service from people who should be doing something else then waiting tables.  We came here on Sunday just after noon. Half their menu items have run out, we light heartedly comment that it must have been a busy morning for them. Her response \"it's always busy.\" Okay whatever.  Staff here don't greet people as they walk through the door. If you've waiting on a table they won't bother saying hi to you until a table becomes open.    They barely show any interest in making the experience pleasant. Yes they're great at refilling my water but what about asking how we are? Small chat? A smile even? Maybe a thank you for our patronage when we leave? Nope. Nothing. Nada.    I can tell they're totally over whelmed. They need maybe 1 or 3 more persons, a dedicated person overseeing drinks, another just doing cash or bringing food out.  Their overworked grumpy faces say it all. They don't enjoy their job.   As for food well read my old review. The food is great! Hope they improve the service."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure treating ourselves to weekend brunch at Fiorentina. Staff is friendly and has found their rhythm it seems and can handle the floor & counter service well - used to have long waits. Miss getting their pork sandwiches over the weekend, I'll have to make a date to come back during the weekday. Looking forward to dinner next visit."}
{"text":"Was fairly empty on a Saturday afternoon; we came here because my friend saw a video on BlogTO.  I had the rabbit eggs benedict. The eggs were perfectly poached, the rabbit meat was tender, and the side salad was light and tasty. You can get half potatoes half salad which is what I did. The potatoes, while yummy, were quite salty and seemed to be deep fried (which I'm not a fan of).  Service was mediocre and while the food was good, it wasn't anything extraordinary. They do have a variety of desserts and pastries though which I would like to try sometime!"}
{"text":"Small little venue with really friendly staff. We arrived at 10am (when they open) and were able to snag a table for two.   They have a very limited menu, but have lots of beverage choices (great loose tea selection).  $18 for french toast and tea with tax and tip"}
{"text":"Great brunch, but went there for dinner and it was fantastic. The dishes were original and the wine pairing (optional) was excellent. If you're looking for a high end dining experience in a small seating, casual atmosphere, this is your place... You'll need reservations."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Greek town and almost all the shops and stores there, this place definitely included. It's a lovely car right along the danforth in the heart if Greek town.  The speciality coffee were absolutely delicious and they had great cheeses to pair with any wine or beverage. Service was very attentive and conversational. The owner greeted us warmly and made us feel very welcome and he was very open to talking about the products and options for each menue item. This is a definite gem in this neighbourhood. It is quite small so it is better to go for a date or intimate outing, but it's absolutely lovely for that, one of my faves!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little cafe/bakery. We arrived just as they opened, and it filled up by about 10:45 so if you don't want to wait for a table come early. They have a menu that changes regularly based on fresh ingredients. They have lots of coffee and tea choices. They have baked goods (butter tars, brownies, macaroons, cupcakes etc) on display that all looked ridiculously good, and I was tempted by most.   I had the brioche french toast with stewed plum spread and creme fresh and maple syrup. It was really good and filling. My friend and the french toast as well, but she asked for the mascarpone cheese with strawberries which was supposed to be the topping the buttermilk pancakes. She found it was too sweet and couldn't finish the whole thing. I think by altering the topping she altered the dish because my tart plums were perfect with the creme fresh.   The mint iced lemonade with was tart and very refreshing. It didn't seem sweetened at all so I added a half spoon of the coarse sugar they had on the table and that was just right for me. I'm glad that I had the choice because I often find drinks too sweet or syrupy.   The service was good. They had warned us that the french toast would be about 15 min when we ordered, which was fine but I appreciate the heads up and glad they make it to order and fresh. I'd definitely go back again. I've read good reviews about the quiche and certainly want to try it 9the day we were there it was ham and cheddar which didn't really excite me so next time I go hopefully it'll be something else)."}
{"text":"I wanted to share a totally EXTRAORDINARY dining experience with all of you! On the recommendation of a good friend, four of us tried Cafe Fiorentina at 236 Danforth tonight. They recently expanded to serving dinner. We eat out a lot, and travel a lot, and tonight were blown away at the phenomenal passion, service and food here. The owners are Alex and Tina, and Alex is the chef. Meeting both of them, we love the passion and commitment they have for their business. The sommelier and front-of-house guy last night is from France. He started studying his craft in France at age 14, formally. Lovely menu, or.....we did the 5-course tasting menu...you have the choice of 3, 5 or 7 courses...with wine pairings if you wish. I cannot tell you how exquisite the food was, and how amazing the wines were, one from Prince Edward County. We were amazed. Truly. Apparently this is a place already known for brunches and lunches, but they now do dinners on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. They have what looks to be an incredible dining experience lined up for Valentine's Day, which they are doing on the 13th. This is a small, intimate place. Do yourselves a favour. If you love innovative, passionate food, try Cafe Fiorentina. I am not affiliated with this business, but am dedicated to local business, and this one deserves your undying love."}
{"text":"I have walked by this place numerous times, but never went in and tried it for some reason. I am an idiot because I've been missing out for really long time. This place is phenomenal!  It smells wonderful when you walk in. It's unmistakable. There is zero chance of there being bad food in any place that smells like this.  The pastries are delicious, far better than another bakery across the street, and this place has the greatest sandwiches I have ever had in my life. I have had a few different panini combinations and the flavours are so layered throughout each bite. I feel like standing in front of the Subway that is a couple of stores down from this place and shoving any customer that wants to get a sweet onion teriyaki and gross bread to this place and forcing them to order a panini. If they took one bite, I doubt they would ever go into a Subway again.  It takes a little while to get your order and just ordering a sandwich is not cheap (around $12), but it's more than worth it. There isn't a better place to eat lunch on the Danforth."}
{"text":"Best Easter brunch in the city. The quiche is fluffy and flavourful. Troy, the server, swept off his feet does it with poise, grace and an infectious smile. I'll be back...count on it!"}
{"text":"Fresh, magnificent food. I live and work nearby and it is hard not to walk by Cafe Fiorentina without something on the menu calling my name.   The quiches are reliably wonderful, rich yet light and fluffy. The classically dressed salad served alongside is a perfect counterpoint. The panini are a hit every time, and run the gamut from an old-fashioned egg salad to heavy, mouthwatering creations of beef cheek, pork belly or seared tuna with tart, zingy relishes. The rotating menu confounds boredom and there is always something new and interesting alongside the old favourites.   Not to forget the spread of pastries which are are simply fantastic. The carrot cake is a favourite, as are the cheesecake muffins, but, but if there are fresh beignets, make a bee-line for these above all else and enjoy with a cappuccino. Doubly so, if they have sour cherry filled ones left.   Prices are absolutely reasonable given the quality of the ingredients. You may have to wait a pause if they are busy, for table service or take-out, but when you consider that your food is being prepared as you wait, it is well worth it. Relax with a magazine and consider the bounty about to appear before you.  A very, very welcome addition to the Danforth restaurant scene."}
{"text":"I'm surprised how few reviews this amazing cafe has; since my visit I've done nothing but sing this unpresuming cafe's praises. The perfect setting for an intimite brunch for two (since it's a tight space with 2-seater cafe tables). The waiters are warm, informative, and attentive without being smothering.  While we waited for our meals, we were tempted by the parade of fresh baked pastries coming out of the kitchen; the cafe counter was piled high with fresh croissants and other classic French pastries.  I couldn't resist the lure of the beignet and devoured one stuffed with lemon curd and it's love from first bite. It was like biting into a fluffy cloud of deliciousness while the lemon curd was the perfect balance of sweet/tart to keep the pastry light.  I ordered the chevre and leek quiche with a side salad - amazing choice. The egg is melt in your mouth tender - a far cry from the usual rubbery puck I've become accustomed to. The salad is lightly dressed a bright vinegrette; wish I can steal the recipe. The boyfriend ordered a sardine confit eggs bennedict topped with two duck eggs which smothered the dish in a rich, luscious sauce, mingling with the bechemel.  Despite being full, I proceeded to pick out $24 worth of pastries. The salted caramel and chocolate ganache tart is phenominal, a must try!  This is my new favourite brunch place in Toronto. Make sure you get here early; I arrived shortly after 10AM and by 10:30 most of the tables were already taken."}
{"text":"Yesss and yes! I was so surprised with the quality of the food. They recently just re-opened and I can't say enough food things about this place. I had the london fog and the quiche. That quiche is perfectly cooked!!  Trust me, not many places can make that and I will def be backing to try out another stuff on the menu. Even their beet carrot soup was excellent."}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved this place. Went there with the family, which included my toddler and my in-laws, and the menu and atmosphere worked for everyone. The food was delicious, coffee was perfect (my americano came with warm milk, unsolicited), and everyone was super friendly. I look forward to going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Had the apple pancake and mushroom/brie omelette, as well as the warm sourdough bread. Everything was delicious, good portions and tasted so fresh. You can tell they use quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Do you feel that bacon and eggs are too simple and you can do bit better than burnt coffee? Good! My visit went like so... sat down and a double cup of steeping french press coffee for the table and ordered the duck eggs Benedict. As I sat there, with my fresh as can be coffee, I felt the oodles of biscotti and sweets staring at me from counter. I resisted as not to ruin myself for the decadence that awaited only 10 minutes away. Having fought off my sugary daemons, my breakfast arrived. Thick enveloping sauce over  perfectly cooked eggs sitting on top flavor full supple duck with an entourage of crispy seasoned potato wedges. Breakfast was sorted. Yum!! Only downside though is that the place has limited seating so unless you luck out or go during weekdays you may be waiting a bit for a table. No bid deal though since they have a couple small tables outside in front of this quaint little bistro where you can enjoy your coffee and ponder what culinary glory will await you."}
{"text":"They use to be on Danforth & Broadview but moved to this slightly bigger location so I've enjoyed a few of their brunch dishes before.  They make delicious food with some fine touches to make the dishes extraordinary but the two waitresses are not attentive and the portions are small for $16 range so never go in with an empty stomach.  There's no other coffee but Americano so no refills.  I tried all of the desserts... You have to...."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch for two - about 45 min wait time. No free coffee refills :( Food was good - had the pancake and tuna dish which were on point. Enjoyed the food. The decor is very nice too. Service was so so. Nice to walk around in the greek village while waiting to get a table."}
{"text":"Delicious fancy breakfast spot in Greek town Toronto. If you're into the boring classic breakfast, I must say like myself lol... this place is not for you! The menu is short but sweet consisting a unique option of breakfast dishes! DUCK egg Bene? Albacore Tuna with a poached egg? The coffee was good and mimosa delicious!   5 stars for food, service and decor!!!"}
{"text":"The service here is slow, but the food is excellent. Came here for brunch and had the duck eggs benny, croque madame, chevre quiche, and the fried chicken.  The quiche was exceptional! Eggs super fluffy and the crust nice and crisp. Some places quickly reheat their quiche and the center is only luke-warm, but here the entire quiche was pipping hot! Highly recommended!  The duck eggs benny was also very delicious. The shredded pork shoulder went well with the perfectly poached duck eggs.  The fried chicken was extremely moist and tender in the middle and crisp on the outside. Only comes with an interesting slightly spicy slaw that wasn't that great, but the chicken was nice.  The croque madame was good, but nothing special. I'm not a big fan of ham, so I didn't particular like this dish, but that's just me.  When we went, the restaurant was almost empty, but it took a long time to get our food. But it was nice that all 4 dishes came together. All dishes came freshly cooked and pipping hot, so the chefs did an excellent job timing the preparation so we can all eat at the same time.  In terms of atmosphere and overall experience, I would have to give a slight edge to Mildred's Temple Kitchen as my favorite brunch place. But given this place has awesome food for a great price, this place comes a close second. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of the of the new location or business model.  *shrugs*  Admittedly this is personal preference."}
{"text":"Where to start? Once you have had a donut here you can never, never have a Tim Horton's donut again! The croissants shatter in your mouth, releasing a flood of buttery pastry flavour. People I was eating with were swooning over the French toast and if you don't have a sweet tooth the trout, garnished with very fresh watercress is amazing. I've bought the bread and the heritage eggs here as well, again ... Something special."}
{"text":"A new favorite brunch spot - all the baked goods are so good that even after a delicious and filling brunch dish, I still had to get some and enjoyed every bite with my coffee!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 6 pm in an empty restaurant. Got turned away because they don't serve food without reservation. An interesting experience."}
{"text":"This week I dropped in for lunch and I noticed that they regularly change the menu. It keeps things fresh.  I didn't find my beloved beet soup on the menu this time around, but I did find 'Duck broth'. Don't let the name disappoint you. It's very tasty and nutritious. Not many places offer wholesome broth. Do people even appreciate broths?   Other items I tried...  Peameal Bacon Sandwich - cheese, tomato, pesto sauce + homemade bread. No wonder their Panini tastes so good. No yeast added in the making process. It's nice to know what goes in to your food.  and...  Mushroom Omelette - it's no conventional white button mushrooms, they use a combination of yellow foot mushrooms (and something else I can't make out) and goat cheese... beautiful flavour combo if you like goat cheese.  Still a fan! I always love a good surprise."}
{"text":"I came because the pictures looked great.  Unfortunately I came at 1pm and only the lunch menu.  Food was ok.  I do expect more for a 11 buck sandwich.  Perhaps some side fries or salad."}
{"text":"This place definitely has potential.  Came here for Sunday brunch. Waited about 15 minutes to get a table for two.  Service is slow because they seem to only have two servers on a busy Sunday.  Unique menu items. I ordered a duck Benny and an americano. My friend ordered spicy beef tartare and candies beets.   Duck Benny wasn't as good as I thought. The pull pork wasn't flavourful enough and the Benny itself was smaller than normal bennies I've had. The duck egg was a unique touch than normal chicken eggs.  Candied beets were delicious. It came on a plate of spinach.  beef Tartare - came on a piece of bread, wasn't expecting that, but I really liked this dish. The bread was soft and the beef tartare was flavoured. It's a bit spicy so be careful if you don't do spice. Different than other tartare I had. Duck egg was a nice touch.  Americano was good. Not too dark, but strong.  I got a Boston cream to go. Very good. The donut was deep fried and the cream was light and whipped. Unlike normal Boston cream I've had.  Cost was $27 per person. Decent."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch. Had the Duck benny with slate (fish). It was great and very filling. The potatoes are super crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The pastries look really good, I was too full from my meal to try them. They had macarons which I really wanted to try in 5 flavours (pistachio, chocolate, etc). The cafe is open from 11-3 on Sundays."}
{"text":"My weekends would not be complete without stopping by Cafe Fiorentina for brunch or just a pastry & coffee to go. If Im in the area at lunch time during the week, I make sure to stop by for a panini. Lovely staff, lovely atmosphere and can't wait to do dinner here."}
{"text":"Maybe I caught them on a bad day, but I wasn't impressed. The service was all right, but the first coffee cup I was given was smeared (very noticeably!) with someone else's lipstick, and my panino was drowned in so much watery aioli that it was basically a soggy mess. Plenty of other brunch places, no need to return to this one."}
{"text":"This place is tiny and doesn't look,Ike much from he outside, but the food - the food is amazing.  Very tight space inside, small metal tables and chairs (not child friendly) . I took a couple of friends from North and they loved it too.    Last time I had the eggs Benedict, and they were awesome. You could really taste the freshness of the locally sourced ingredients . You can't go wrong with any of the egg dishes.  Mimosas are also scrumptious ,  it not be best I've had in t.o."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch a couple of weeks ago. I found myself in a small quiet place with only a few tables. When we were seated I looked around and noticed they had a daily menu and the display and counter were filled with very fresh looking baked goods.   Service was pretty good and good took a little while to show up (small yet busy kitchen) but it was worth the wait. Delicious breakfast! Had the duck eggs benny and it was awesome. Finished it off with a soft and flakey almond croissant and a really nice americano. I'd like to come back again soon and try more on their menu, and definitely more of the pastries too."}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday bunch. They have a pretty good selection of pastries. When we arrived we sat at the pastry table because all the tables were taken. I wanted to take a bite out of everything!    We ordered the duck Benny with smoked beef tongue with salad and croque madam. The food was so good. I loved the duck Benny, it was so tasty! The benny was done perfectly, the amount of the yolky goodness is beautiful and whole dish together was delicious!   Right before we left and we got a chocolate almond croissant, it was delicious. Flaky in the outside and soft in the inside. We are definitely going back and try other items!"}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite lunch spots on the Danforth. The food is always delicious and fresh and it has a very quaint decor. It's perfect if you want to grab something to go as well."}
{"text":"I did liked this little cute cafe and thought its a gem in the neighborhood and always amused by how good the pastries are . Everything is made in house even bread and croissant . For a small cafe it's pretty impressive.  At night they serve 3 courses prefix menu with extra 20 for wine pairing . I haven't had  a chance to try yet and also the ever changing menu make . went a few times during the day and keep going back cause I thought the pastry Is wonderful ,love the croissant and the coconut pie . Also tried the seared tuna sandwich the bread is so crispy and chewy after pressing it in panini machine . Have a soup to go with it is a better idea!  Had an awful experience last time I ordered this cauliflower soup & garlic, it's purée with overpowering acidity and couldn't taste the garlic whatsoever ever.  she told me I couldn't get refund or exchange the soup since I had a sip of the soup. I walked out cause I feel embarrassing that I was begging for sth , yet as a matter of fact all I want is maybe they can make some adjustments to unsatisfied customer when they can't stand the food or at least show you care about it ."}
{"text":"Exquisite! I only had normal breakfast food, but they did a great job. The only downside was that they did not served brewed coffee. I had Amdricano."}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch as well as a private event, and loved the experience both times. Don't be fooled by the simple menu or size of this place - locally-sourced ingredients and friendly service make for a winning combination. Although some menu items might sound like favourite brunch grease bombs, I'm impressed how well the food is prepared - you won't leave feeling like you ate a brick of lard. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It was ok. The food was pretty tasty. Service was pretty slow. It was one of those things where we got a weird vibe from the server from the get-go, and she seemed quite unfriendly to start with. On top of that, we were with a friend who had severe food allergies and they seemed rather unwilling to budge on their \"chief does not change his recipes\" attitude. Ultimately, they budged, which was nice. However, again, attitude was there and it was a task to get them to pay attention to us to get even a water refill. The 2/5 was really based on the fact that the food was actually tasty once we got it, but getting to that point was quite frustrating. Probs won't go there again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and we didnt know it was in greek town until we arrived. The entire street is available for parking.   Small and simple menu for brunch, with a limited selection of caffeine and tea. Their Irish Coffee is a must try!!  Got the duck benny (big duck fan) - delicious dish, surprisingly, the highlight was actually the potato. I usually don't even finish the side potatos, but they were seasoned so well that I didn't even wanted ketchup. They were super crispy and went well with the bennies.  Close to a 5 star, only if they had better service. Will be back for more potatos!!"}
{"text":"My first visit here and I was impressed with quality food, decent menu selection, well organized and efficient staff and friendly/competent service and respectable wait times at  prime time. The atmosphere is hospitable and comfortable, certainly not pretentious or modern and customers are a variety people all ages who appreciate decent quality. I found some of the egg food items a little expensive but acceptable. Breakfast for two with juice and small desert at $55 incl tax/tip.. The meals were quite delicious and most everything well made on premises. Recomended if this fits your budget."}
{"text":"Cute little place with the best croque madame in the city. It was crispy and light. Definitely will go back when I'm in the area.   I also ordered a quiche which was fantastic but over shadowed by the corque Madame."}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.  Came here for brunch with my bf cause he saw it was featured on blogto. My bf wanted to try their duck eggs benedict, but they didn't have duck eggs that day. The other thing we wanted to try was some pork and eggs dish which they also didn't have on the menu that day so that was disappointing.  Corque Madame ($16) This was essentially ham and cheese sandwich with a cream sauce, topped with 2 fried eggs. The cheese was oosey which I liked. The toast wasn't sauce and nice and crunchy which was nice. this dish comes with potatoes or salad. Probably should have gotten the salad as the potatoes were not that great.  I had the Brisket Tartine ($12) This was delicious! It was a beef brisket topped on top of a brioche toast, with kimchi, pickled vegetables garnishes and topped with a fried egg. The brisket was flavorful, and went really well with the kimchi and pickled vegetables. Originally i was worried this wouldn't be too filling but it was just the right amount.  The food is good, but I've had better brunch elsewhere. Note: Their menu changes often. Service was ok. Took awhile to be seated and served and they weren't exactly that busy."}
{"text":"The best. Fantastic food and service in a super cute space. Lineups at opening at 10. Make reservations or get there early. Dinner and lunch are equally amazing and not quite as crazy. Be aware - closed Mondays. (Can't tell you how many times we've forgotten and showed up for lunch to be disappointed) and there is nothing comparable at all in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place a zillion times, it's across the the street from my butcher and just east of the LCBO. I never really gave it a thought, assuming it was just a twee coffee shop for fools who actually drink coffee that they don't brew at home first thing in the morning for medicinal purposes, ie. getting the BM done before you leave the house. I will never understand modern coffee culture. \"Let's meet up for a coffee and see if things click,\" says every middle-aged man on OkCupid. Me: *rolls eyes*  Click shmlick, how about let's go get a few pints and let the beer goggles do their magic. What is this clicking everyone is after? IRL it sometimes takes me months to figure out if someone is bone-worthy. You cannot possibly \"click\" over a cup of joe. Coffee has ruined modern romance and I will have none of it.  Anyway, this place is not a coffee shop, it's a breakfast/brunch place. And yes, I approve of brunch. In my perfect world, there would be only one meal a day. I love breakfast food but not first thing. It takes me hours to want to eat and I don't care what anyone says about breakfast being the most important meal of the day, if I can't get it down, I'm not going to force it. I like to let my stomach get all gnarled up with angry growls before shovelling in the coals, it's more grateful than if it constantly gets a steady flow of nuts and birdseed which keeps it complacent. I will have none of that either.  My friend Lorraine took me here yesterday after discovering it during a rain storm a couple of weeks ago. She knew I'd love it as the word \"charcuterie\" gives me lady boner and it's on the menu. She makes award-winning quiche (and yes, her name is Lorraine) but had Fiorentina's and actually said it was better than hers. This is high praise. Something about the eggs being like \"eating clouds\" and yes, she gets high a lot.  Inside, we grabbled the window stools which is perfect for summer people watching. Riverdalians are amazing. They're affluent hippie-types, from the beginning of the baby boom generation and they dress like Stevie Nicks. Even the men. I want to be a hippie when I grow up.  I ordered the Croque Madame, that is a Croque Monsieur but with two fried heritage eggs on top. Lorraine ordered duck eggs benedict. We had wine by the $5 glass, a highly civilized beverage for brunch, so we had two.  My sandwich was the best thing I ever ate. See, I let my stomach writhe with fury all morning and into the early afternoon, at one point I was so starving, I was chewing on my hair, sucking the salt out. IDK why my hair is salty but it is. But yeah, that sandwich tho... the eggs were sunny-side up, comically placed on top of the sandwich, I wonder do they call it a \"madame\" because it looks like a set of boobs on top of a monsieur, which is ham and cheese btw, and there's some crunchy fried bread involved, must be eaten with a fork. The eggs were \"heritage,\" meaning what? Hand plucked from a chicken who ran freely in the sunshine? That is my interpretation. Chickens need sunshine and freedom. Anyway, these were the best eggs I've ever had on top of a sandwich I wanted to bone if it manifested itself into a man. We clicked.  I did not want to share with Lorraine but I let her have a tiny bit and she let me have a tiny bit of her benedict which had pulled pork and it was yum but I think she had food envy over mine. I will never order anything else when I come back.  Also: The Boston Cream donut. If the sandwich was a hot dude, then that donut was his prowess. Sweet Jesus."}
{"text":"I've been going there for a while now, never been disappointed once. A great quality ingredients will for sure make a great quality food. Everything is made in house and it's really great. I love their americano too, the coffee bean they use is amazing."}
{"text":"Cafe Fiorentina makes me feel I am a special guest at someone house.   Talking about homey and cozy! Only 8 tables for 2 so you looking at 16 patrons at one time.   Everything are made to order and ingredients are just so fresh and all locally sourced and prepared in house!  I was lucky to get the last table for a Sunday Brunch.   Menu changed daily and they have them posted on the website and on the white chalk board. Order and take a seat, the food will be delivered to your table and after you pay at the counter.  Duck Egg Benny with Bacon Fat Fries ($14) is just awesome. I know I can be healthy and have a salad on the side but Bacon Fat? How can I resist?  The bacon.. love the bacon... so much flavour and great balance of fat and lean.   Duck egg? I have a urge to get a carton of duck egg after I ate that...  The pastries just look amazing.. Pumpkin tart? Banana loaf? Beignet? Brownies?  I definitely need to come back for some of those...."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for brunch since they opened, and doubly want to go for dinner now that they offer that, but I'll take the opportunity I had this weekend for my Saturday morning coffee and treat. How lovely!  First I love the interior of this cute little café. Nothing fancy, it's actually quite basic with small wire chairs and white walls. This matters little when you can tell people who love food designed it. They have all these jams and preserves lined up along the wall that slow your pace to a crawl after you walk in the door. I was so distracted by these the boyfriend had to point out all the saveur magazines and well respected cook books lined up on the wall. Not even mentioning the smell and warmth of good food cookin' just put me in a happy place. This is my sort of café.   My sweet tooth then pulled me over to the case of treats. Butter tarts, blueberry tarts, peach tarts, boston cream doughnuts all caught my eye. I was told by one of the two servers that everything is made fresh daily, and that things change regularly as it's all seasonal (I better make sure to get back for a peach tart before summer is gone!) She also highly recommended the carrot cake, so I had a slice of that. I've had a lot of good carrot cake, my own being a favourite of most who've had it, and this was definitely one of the best I've had. The cream cheese icing was smooth and not overly sweat, the cake was dense and moist with a nice crumb.   I was also here for a coffee, and asked the other server if he could make me a cortado (it's not on the menu, but still a commonly known drink) He didn't know what that was (clearly a server and not a barista, my heart sank a bit) but was happy to try after my explanation.  I'm not sure what beans they use, but it was nothing memorable. The milk drowned the espresso and was poorly frothed with lots of visible bubbles. It wasn't really fair of me but it clearly illuminated that coffee isn't a focus or specialty. I guess they can't be completely perfect, next time I will stick to the menu and will be back to eat. Watch for my updated review!"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to go to Cafe Fiorentina the first day at their new location.  The place was packed! There are never enough brunch spots on the Danforth (or anywhere in TO) so they were slammed. They didn't have enough staff to man all the tables, so they let us start with coffees in the 'closed' section while we waited for a table.  The food and the presentation was fantastic! I don't normally Instagram my food, but the smoked fish I had deserved an audience. We were all very happy with our food. The service was a little uncoordinated, but that's totally understandable.  I hadn't been to their old location, but I'm glad they're back."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to revisit Fiorentina for brunch ever since visiting them a long time ago for a Yelp event. To be honest, it's been years in the making.   It all seems very promising when a long line up form outside of the restaurant started forming before they open.   All these illusions disintegrated when my food arrived. The bottom of the beet, brie and arugula quiche ($14) is soggy. The flavours and textures of the quiche was decent, however, the tart crust really left a lot to be  desire. Fried potoes I had requested did not arrive. Instead, salad came with the quiche. It has been 30 minutes since the server offered to bring some potatoes and still no potatoes in sight.    I finished my meal and my drink has yet to come. While, I can appreciate how busy they are but I feel like Fiorentina can really improve its quality and service. I would have given it two stars, however, potatoes finally arrived. Hurray for potatoes! One extra star for that even though it was fried a little darker than I would prefer and there were burnt pieces."}
{"text":"Was here for Saturday brunch...  Food was good, pastry was great! Definitely do this again."}
