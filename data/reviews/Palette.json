{"text":"Ate here recently, and was disgusted by hairs in TWO different dishes. One longer hair was well mixed in the apple compote of the Honey Almond Brie appetizer. The appetizer included warm apple compote, brie, grapes, and lavosh. I didn't like the lavosh, and was disgusted by the lighter brown hair --which went unnoticed until after most of the appetizer was gone.    Management removed the charge for the appetizer. Just after that was taken care of, my salad arrived with a small hair visible (saw it right as it was placed in front of me, thankfully). I told the person that delivered it to take it back immediately, that I didn't want it. He did. The charge was removed for it. They asked if I wanted something else, but I had lost my appetite. Management removed the charge for the salad, too. I think management did their best to remedy the immediate situation. I hope they can improve things for future.  Companion's pork buns and tortilla soup both received a \"meh\" rating. Not worth repeating.  I love sitting by the windows at Palette. In the past, I have enjoyed drinks here and meals. I really don't have a desire to return here for food any time soon.  I think hair nets are needed in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Whenever I visit the museum I make a point to stop at Palette. Wonderful food and always fresh and delicious. I like the fact that they use local food suppliers! Service is consistently excellent!"}
{"text":"I truly want to love Palette.  Truly I do!  A lunch rendezvous as a perfect midway break during galleries and exhibits at the Phoenix Art Museum should be remarkable.  But Palette has some serious drawbacks that need tending to.  It's Contemporary Stylish, but kind of blah, and would benefit from a more daring color scheme and more interesting furniture -- it currently resembles a College Conference room.  The menu choices sound great, and the ingredients are fresh, but everything is just a bit underseasoned; everything tastes like expensive Assisted Living Center food.  Not bad, but not as exciting as an Art Museum dining space should ideally be.  The staff is pleasant, but not particularly engaging -- they hire VERY young people, and do not really look to train them to be particularly energetic.  And please, add two or three more exciting dessert choices.  As it is, Palette is decent, but it would be nice to have a destination restaurant in Phoenix's only true outpost of stimulating culture."}
{"text":"Terrible. Food over priced, and you would get better service through a drive though window. Cafeteria setting. Don't do it."}
{"text":"On Wednesdays the Phoenix Art Museum [PAM] is free, and having dinner at Palette inside P.A.M. makes for a great date night.   Palette has something for everyone despite the short menu. I had the grilled chicken caprese sandwich with a side salad and a belgium wheat beer.  My date had the grilled quesadilla and a belgium wheat beer. We sat facing the sculpture garden overlooking the twinkle lights and perfectly manicured lawn.  Service was excellent.  Now they are expanding the theater so there is construction to the south view...we just didn't face that direction.  The only disappointment was that all the beers are in bottles, no tap. However, they have a good selection of wines."}
{"text":"$13 fish and chips was 2 small fillet's, ala, Gorton's out-of -the-box, and some okay fries. Sooo like LJ Silver's at, what, $5.99? Friends hummus veggie platter looked clunky and uninspired, but inexpensive during HH. The very limited menu made it difficult to satisfy anything beyond the very least adventurous dining. With the myriad, and far superior, choices in the central corridor, this place is merely convenient to (within) the art museum. Have a $3.50 Prickly Pear lemonade and Yelp other options."}
{"text":"Didn't actually eat anything here because we tried twice while we were at the Art Museum today & couldn't get seated. There was a long line at the front for seating both times & no hostess there to help anyone. A waiter told us there was a long wait, but about a quarter of the tables were filled (inside & out). There was obviously not enough staff & this was during a special event at the museum. We walked out."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch while visiting the Phoenix Art Museum, as Palette is located in the Museum. Wanting something light for lunch, I ordered a bowl of their Mexico City Style Chicken Tortilla Soup, and it was delicious. Contrary to another reviewer's experience, I didn't find the soup to be bland, although I didn't find it especially spicy either. It was tasty and I would label it as moderately spicy. The cafe itself is beautifully decorated, fittingly with a modernist theme, and the service was prompt and polite. I wish that they had a few more sandwich options on the menu and I thought that $9.00 was a little expensive for a bowl of soup, but overall I had a good experience and would return the next time I visit the Phoenix Art Museum."}
{"text":"plenty of refills on drinks, which was nice. Wifi is practically non-existent. Also, kind of a bad sign on how employees are treated when they aren't given enough time to actually see what's going on in the museum. Makes conversations awkward when you want to talk to your waiter about the museum and they've never been inside!"}
{"text":"This place is too expensive for poor service. The waiting times for food (a simple salad & bruschetta) was too long for no reason. Empty water glasses left us thirsty. At least you can make a reservation but the restaurant seemed too empty to even need one. This place is a no-go."}
{"text":"I was visiting my Mother and had a few hours before I needed to go to the airport, so I suggested that we pop by the Phoenix Art Museum and have lunch at the café. I liked that they have a sticker \"pass\" at the museum's front desk, so that we weren't asked to pay the museum entrance fee just to go to the café. (We also went into the gift shop; I figured it would be okay with the museum for us to spend more money.) Even though it was a Tuesday, there seemed to be a lot of waitstaff, so we got fairly individual attention. I had the Cuban Press sandwich and my mother had the Curry Chicken Salad sandwich; both were very good, with generous portions. It's true that the prices are high, but for whatever reason I love eating in museum restaurants, so I expect that and don't mind."}
{"text":"Hubby and I enjoyed some prickly pear lemonade and a basket of their fries last week during our visit to the museum. We will definitely be back to try more--the food everyone was ordering around us looked awesome!"}
{"text":"We have always been happy with the food here but the service has been consistently inconsistent.   Today we sat down for a late lunch 2:30ish. The restaurant had patrons but was far from busy. There was a party of 3 at the next table. I noticed that 2 of the patrons were eating, one was not.   We waited awhile and after about 5 minutes a waiter \"nearly\" brought us water...then he realized he was at the wrong table and said he'd be right back with waters for us.   We watched somewhat amused, at staff moving very quickly around the restaurant but not carrying any food or anything else. After an indeterminate wait, the waiter returned but this time he was carrying a plate for the person at the table next to us (the one not eating)....the other 2 people were well past halfway through their lunches when this poor woman finally got her lunch.   We waited awhile longer, still seeing wait staff walking through other parts of the restaurant....eventually,  we decided we were invisible (although only two tables distant from the bar) and decided to leave.   On the way out I noticed that the \"hostess\" was busying herself at what looked liked a computer station across the restaurant, a waiter at the bar directly in front of our table appeared to organizing his receipts in a neat stack....no one noticed our departure.  Having said all of the above I can honestly say that in the past we have actually tasted the food and it was very good.The last time I was here the service was a little slow but we were acknowledged,  given menus and got our food (everyone was served at the same time)."}
{"text":"Was told to come here to try the cheese curds only to be told they didn't have any.  Ordered a sandwich on focaccia bread but they didn't have focaccia.  Poblano sandwich was good.  Nothing amazing.  Service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"We stopped for a nosh after the Hollywood Costume exhibit. A pleasant respite in the sculpture garden. A nice selection of wines and craft brews as well as delectable dishes. Made the museum experience all that much more pleasant."}
{"text":"This place was a great.  My husband gets credit for picking this place.  He planned a day at the museum and lunch here and it was a very nice experience all the way around.  First we headed over to the restaurant and picked a nice shady spot out on the patio.  It was beautiful outside, the weather was amazing and the view of the sculptures, and greener was very pleasing.  The service was excellent.  They were very quick and helpful suggesting some of the best things on the menu.  My husband had the rueben and the sweet potato salad which was out of this world amazing.  I told our server and he gave me a really nice picture/recipe card for it.  It was a few months ago and I dont remember what I had other than I remember it was so good no complaints from me but what won the whole meal was that insane sweet potato salad.  Whats nice about having lunch here first is that you can tour the museum and burn off those calories.   Also the light rail drops off right in front of the museum.  Another little tip is if you are an MCC student you get into the museum for free."}
{"text":"I waited 30 minutes for their \"Best of Phoenix\" Grilled Cheese and Herb Parmesan fries. Both were plain and were not savory at all, and I still can't believe it was $16. For a cafe to be attached to the Phoenix Art Museum, I expect better quality. There are much better places within a mile radius making amazing food for half that price. I suggest eating elsewhere if you want to get a bite to eat before or after the museum."}
{"text":"I was more than pleasantly surprised by my afternoon lunch here.  I was impressed.  The waiters were terrific: personable yet straightforward, and quick!  The food, although a bit expensive, in my opinion, was excellent.  In fact, my Grilled Shrimp Salad was one of the best I have ever tasted!  It was outdone by the dessert, however.  We were encouraged by the Server to try the Coconut Cake, as it was his favorite.  I don't even especially like coconut but it was fantastic!  The cake was dense, the frosting was buttery, and creamy, and not-too-sweet.  The meal was absolutely perfection!  I would definitely recommend this, with some time at the museum, for a perfect afternoon!"}
{"text":"Consistently great healthy food. ... And a few delights like their coconut cake pastries. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Best salad I've ever had.  Had the roasted beet salad that came with yellow beets, goat cheese, some nuts in a light vinaigrette and a side of french bread.  Scrumptious lunch while at the Phoenix Art Museum!  If the service matched the quality of the food here, I would definitely give 5 stars."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this restaurant is that they try to support local farmers with their food.  Everything tastes like fine cuisine made at home... a perfect balance.  They have a nice small bar too if you want a cocktail or a beer."}
{"text":"I luckily work near by the phoenix museum, so decided to walk with a co-worker for lunch one day.  It's a nice short walk from our office and hte walk through the museum is a small treat.  I wish I could write about more than just a bowl of soup, but it was a delicious bowl of soup at the very least.  I ordered the butternut squash bisque.  It was very tasty and enough to keep me satisfied for the rest of the day.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  The restaurant was quite full for being a weekday at lunch.    I will be back."}
{"text":"Great menu, friendly waitstaff, artsy atmosphere.  I wish this place were open for dinner and had its own entrance. The Kale salad with salmon was to die for as well as the crab cakes.  Daniel, our server, was very attentive and friendly (and has great hair!) Everybody seemed to really be having a good time that works there. David, the manager was very informative and told us this place is affiliated with The Farm at South Mountain and Santa Barbara Catering Company. It doesn't get much better than this folks.  This is a definite good suggestion for lunch or Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Good quality food for a cafe located in a museum.  I ordered a raspberry chicken salad which consisted of fresh greens, fresh raspberries, goat cheese, toasted almonds, and raspberry vinaigrette.  At $15.00, it was on the pricier side for a salad but it definitely made for a good, light lunch.  The grilled bread that accompanied the salad was soft and buttery and complimented the meal perfectly."}
{"text":"The restaurant inside the Phoenix Art Museum is great!  Lovely set-up, wonderful ingredients and combinations (affiliated with the Farm at South Mountain), pleasant and attentive staff, and reasonable prices - all in all, the best museum restarant I've been to!  We stopped in for some drinks and an appetizer between exhibits and were so pleasasantly surprised by food quality (without the inflated prices that usually come with being a captive audience), warm service and atmosphere and we actually planned to come hungry on our next museum visit.    The food around us looked yummy: the sandwiches have great-looking ingredients, the crab cakes look marvelous and have barely any filling (per the server), and the coconut cake is a delightfully generous portion. To top it all off, they have named the menu items to go with their Hollywood Costume theme - hilarious!!"}
{"text":"Miserable. Where to start? Summary: expensive bad food with no eye toward customer service or food safety.   1) They don't open until an hour *after* the museum. So grabbing a caffeine boost or snack before walking is not possible.  2) They opened the museum interior doors more than 10 minutes late. Whereupon we discovered the doors to the sculpture garden had been open since *before* 11 - additionally the hostess was quite inconvenienced to have to notice there were people waiting at the entrance to be seated.  3) The menu selection is limited and expensive. Partially excused because it's in a museum, must gouge the public.  4) The expensive food is bad. Just bad. I paid $14 for some Gorton's fish sticks and Ore-Ida frozen fries (albeit liberally sprinkled with seasoned salt and a little Parmesan cheese).  5) The kitchen ignores allergy notifications. My dining partner has an allergy to black pepper and informed our server who assured us her salmon would not have any. The salmon did not have any, but every other piece of food on the plate was liberally doused in pepper. I had to wonder if it was done in spite."}
{"text":"WE had a very nice meal here while visiting the Phoenix Art Museum.  The food was fresh tasting and had a good flavor.  I had the beet salad with chicken and it was very tasty and filling  We had the prickly pear lemonade which was sweet and refreshing.  The waiter gave us a carafe for the table which was nice.  Service was very good and it was a nice lunch.  There is outdoor seating when the weather is cooler."}
{"text":"Loved the food there. I had shrimp tacos, my husband had white chili.     The reason for three stars is the service was the worse I have ever had and there were only 8 other people in there. We never got our water glasses refilled nor did we ever see the waitress again after she brought our food. We had to go up to the cashier which is no big deal to pay our bill but it would have been nice to get refilled and asked if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early dinner before checking out the Michelangelo exhibit.  The food was pretty good although I wasn't blown away. We ordered the Italian sandwich, truffle fries and a side of brie. The brie was a bit of a disappointment (small portion and way too oily) but the sandwich and fries were delicious! The service was outstanding and I loved how she brought me a small pitcher of iced tea along with my glass."}
{"text":"The dining experience was OK, nothing great.  The food took forever and yet there were only a few patrons seated.  My Cuban sandwich was basically a large piece of bread with a tablespoon of shredded pork for $14.50.  When I complained to my server that my sandwich was skimpy, she laughed at me.  Customer service is nonexistent at this place.  Perhaps she forgot that it is the customers that give her a job.  Well, I will not be going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"We loved the idea of this cafe.  Locally sourced food and a changing menu based on freshly available products.  He had the BBQ Sliders and I had the Chicken Panini.  The BBQ sliders were done well and the bun used was fresh and tasty.  The Chicken Panini was cooked well and the red onions were a great touch.    The sides were the semi-missed out on piece of the puzzle.  The feta and bean salad was just okay, not bad, but not as good.  Considering that it was roughly $10.50 for the sliders and $13 for the panini, it was too much money for the offerings given (total $23.50 for just two sandwich plates - no drinks, no dessert).  They had Stewart Root Beer, which was definitely a bonus in my fiancee's book!    Overall: B We wouldn't mind giving this place another try, but considering the price tag for just sandwiches with just okay sides - we most likely will try other options in the downtown Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"One of my coworkers suggested a girls' lunch here in May.  This place is located just inside the Phoenix Art Museum (which I didn't know had a cafe).  You don't have to pay admission - just tell one of the museum employees that you're just visiting the cafe and they'll give you a special colored sticker.  The cafe is cute and open with lots of windows.  I ordered the the quinoa salad and the grilled cheese and they were wonderful.  The quinoa salad is cold which I didn't expect but it paired well with the grilled cheese.  Expect to pay $20 for lunch because the ingredients are local and natural.    The food was excellent but I will probably only come here once in a while due to the price."}
{"text":"Food was good, but overpriced. Had a bad experience with check. We went for Mothers Day brunch.  The waiter service was mediocre - didn't bring silverware, didn't clear plates from appetizers, 45 minutes before entree came, etc.. Upon receiving the check I put in a 10% tip, for a total of well over $160 due to a set per person price.  The waiter comes back and says 20% is mandatory due to event and that I need to add $20 to the bill.  I wasn't going to cause an issue, but later I ran the math and the tip turned out to be 22% of the total including taxes.  That is a huge disappointment; the waiter scammed me, and now the restaurant lost a customer forever."}
{"text":"The warm brie was nice and came with a side of grapes.. The latte was good too. A bit on the pricey end but we expected that from a museum cafe"}
{"text":"My grilled portobella sandwich was not special. One half of sandwich had no red peppers and where was the focaccia bread. It looked and tasted like a regular roll. French fries were tasty, but were lukewarm and consisted of short pieces like the remnants of an order. My fellow diners were happy with their dishes but I was not."}
{"text":"I'd guessed correctly that I wouldn't be able to bring a cup of coffee into the museum, so I entered Palette to see what I could find to quell my hunger and thirst.  I hoped to find a quick bite before perusing the newer exhibits at the museum.  However,Palette isn't a place in which to do anything quickly.  Even an app of warmed honey and almond-encrusted brie, with lavosh cracker rounds, a bunch of grapes, and cinnamon apple cubes deserve to be savored with a glass of chilled AZ Stronghold chardonnay! https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=iAQ7lxKIrahysDcIVZ_lEQ&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  I chose to sit at a table by the windows, as it was a beautiful day outside.  I imagined it romantic to snack and read in a sunny spot, with plants surrounding me- albeit the plants were outside!  I felt like I was on a picnic, of sorts!    The honey and almond-encrusted brie was so addicting!  I couldn't stop slathering it on the crackly lavosh rounds, then topping it with the heavenly cubes of cinnamon apples (also served very warm).  The grapes were such fun to bite into, and their sweetness and tang went hand-in-hand with the cheese and my sips of wine!  I am looking forward to returning soon-- I found about three more savory items on the menu I'd like to try.

{"text":"Fresh sandwiches, soups, and salads with a focus on organic, local, and seasonal foods.  They have a variety of dishes that will satisfy vegetarians and carnivores alike.  I started out with a mango iced tea ($2.25) which was cool and refreshing, and split the roasted beet salad and the portabella melt (Both $12).  Both were excellent.  The roasted beet salad was huge and had a nice balance of sweet and acidic from the caramelized roasted beets to the sherry vinegar dressing.  It had a good amount of toasted pistachios in it too to provide some added crunch, also included creamy goat cheese crumbles, and came with a toasty buttered slice of crusty bread.  The portabella sandwich came on some nicely toasted bread, and was a nice blend of textures and tastes from the cheese, mushroom, and roasted red bell pepper.  The sweet potato salad was very good as a side.    Service was good, and the ambiance is nice.  The patio looks very scenic, and I'd definitely like to eat here again to take advantage of the nice outdoor setting."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place!   My mom and I had the warm brie appetizer, she had the tacos and I had the cuban sandwich! Everything was amazingggggg! I can't stress that enough!   And the staff: AMAZING and super, super friendly. They were timely, on point and just awesome! I loved the prickly pear lemonade! OMG! I need to smuggle prickly pear lemonade into CA with me :P Lol!   Thank you guys for the wine & tequila! It made for a fun art romp! :D   Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"My family came here for Mother's Day, which consisted of a $55 prix fixe menu- 2 dishes with a mimosa and dessert buffet. Little did we know that two of the five selections would not be available by the time we were able to order... Isn't that the point of taking reservations? To know how many people will be ordering the items you have set on the menu? Then, the food arrived in complete shambles. It was lukewarm, not appetizing or appealing to look at whatsoever. Our server apologized several times and did a great job taking care of us. He said he would let his manager know, but no manager ever came to speak to us or apologize on the kitchen's behalf. Very unprofessional. If it weren't for our server being so kind, we would have walked out upon the presentation of the second course. For $55, this was a horrible display of what management and the kitchen staff have to give to the people of Phoenix. No compensation was given back to us on our check either, we paid full price for low quality, unappealing food. I felt ripped off and my mother was beyond irritated. We will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"I visited Palette soon after it opened at 11AM on a Wednesday. I was seated and taken care of right away. Even though I was in a seat that was kind of hidden, my server checked on me every few minutes. I didn't have any of the service issues other people have noted on Yelp, but then, I was also one of the first customers of the day.  As for the food--oh my. I ordered the Mission Fig Salad. It was gorgeous. I should have taken a picture of it. The lettuce was green and purple with the full chicken breast neatly sliced to one side. Big crumbles of blue cheese, sliced fig, and candied pecans dappled the outer edge like Christmas presents beneath a tree. The balsamic vinaigrette complemented the sweetness of the figs and pecans in a wonderful way; sweet, but not too sweet. It's a big salad but it's not a heavy salad, not like a chop salad might be at another place. I didn't have any leftovers.  Also, it came with a toasted slice of bread. It was perfectly done--crunchy but not hard. It tasted very fresh with just the right amount of butter.  The cost ($13.50) was more than most salads at restaurants, but considering the local ingredients, I thought it was quite reasonable. I would absolutely eat at Palette again. I'd love to try some of their other salads."}
{"text":"The staff are the best.  Two of us were eating and one of our dishes didn't taste so good.  I mentioned this to the waiter who, without hesitation, took away the food and replaced it quickly with a different order.  He apologized twice (not like it's his fault!!).  I was really impressed by the wait staff.  The food is typically delicious, too!  We ended up having the warm brie with honey and slivered almonds...delish!!!"}
{"text":"Located inside the Phoenix art museum.  Weird. Lolz but we went anyways. I ordered the bean hummus, oh my lanta, it was delicious.  My sister and I killed it. :) I loved my portobello melt sammich. It was so good. But not too much of the quinoa on the side. :/ it taste so bland and watery..  Our waiter was a little slow on our refills, but other than that. It was very good. I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere. Food was very well prepared and the staff very attentive. Wasn't expecting the quality this restaurant delivered being located in the museum itself."}
{"text":"Delicious break while walking around the Phoenix Art Museum.  Friendly staff, relaxed environment, and reasonably priced food and wine.  I highly recommend the Cuban Pressed sandwich.  It was amazing!"}
{"text":"OpenTable let me make a Sunday brunch reservation for today at 11:00.  Imagine my surprise when we arrived and they informed us--EXTREMELY rudely--that they opened at noon.  There was no apology or discussion as I offered to show her the confirmation email.   I urged the woman who was working to update the OpenTable page and she rolled her eyes as she closed the door.  It was sort of a sad moment as Santa Barbara Catering did our wedding...at the art museum...and we were really looking forward to this brunch."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot and not just because it's across the street from my office. The menu mostly consists sandwiches and salads, as well as a few appetizers and entrees. But don't be fooled into thinking the food is \"boring, accessible, business-lunch fare.\" Far from it. The menu has subdued Southwestern influences and executes everything with skill and grace. The chicken salad sandwich is to die for, as is the pork belly sandwich. Also highly enjoyable are the seasonal quiche, Sonoran chopped salad, barbecue pork sliders, and green chile stew.  In sum, this restaurant demonstrates that well-prepared food using fresh, local ingredients might be all you really need.  P.S.: Phoenix Art Museum members get 10% off, so join!"}
{"text":"We stopped before leaving the museum for a salad and the warm brie, the food was delicious, however the service was slow as molasses, we were left sitting for long amounts of time before placing our drink order, placing our food order and then while waiting for the food, which was not elaborate.  I've sat at the bar before and just had drinks and that usually goes great so I didn't expect such long waits in the nearly empty dining room."}
{"text":"We had lunch here today- my favorite spot for lunch! The mango ice tea is amazing! The Cuban sandwich is to die for - try the quinoa salad as a side... So good! The salmon dish (friend ordered) looked beautiful and she ate every bite! Fresh farm to table with a beautiful view!!!! I recommend making a reservation on open table and requesting a table with a view!"}
