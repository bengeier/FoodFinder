{"text":"Everytime I go up north I love having dinner at the Rio, the ribs are delicious and I also love the soups, they are hearty and taste homemade as opposed to most restos where they taste like they are from a can. Such a warm atmosphere, would definitely recommend the Rio"}
{"text":"Great Baby Back Ribs, very tender meat, it fell right off the bone. The steak was good as well and the staff was really friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best ribs in town!  Tender, smoky, not too spicy sauce. Fries were nice and crispy, perfect golden color. This is where the locals eat so it is always packed. On the negative side : a bit pricey, and service is a little slow. Overall a nice place."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp shortly after arriving in town. Only 3 reviews but they were positive and I like BBQ so gave it a shot. Great tomato soup and decent salads.  Had the ribs, really good. Amazing flavor and a great sauce - I bought two jars to take home!  The ribs themselves were too mushy for my liking, I don't like \"fall of the bone\" but if you do then you'll love these.  I prefer chewier ribs I have to rip off the bone.  Brisket sandwich was good too, small portion compared to the ribs but it is half the price.  Both came with tons of fresh fries. My vegetarian daughter loved the Brie/asparagus quesadilla which came with a big salad. Overall a very enjoyable causal family restaurant."}
{"text":"Location: In the heart of St. Sauveur village. Street parking only.   The place: This family-owned business offers up a cottage vibe, with lots of wood accents, low ceilings and a cozy atmosphere. The space is small and can feel a bit cramped but hey - that's part of its charm. Oh, and everything is home-made (but probably not the dessert).  Food: These guys specialize in chicken and ribs - emphasis on ribs. If you're a fan of the baby back, this is the place for you. You can order à la carte or take advantage of their Table d'Hôte. I went with the Table d'Hôte.  To start, Rio offers home-made soup or tomato juice - I skipped this part of the meal. Two at my table had the soup and I snuck a taste - it was delicious and included lots of veggies in addition to the flavourful broth.  Given a choice of appetizers, I went with the escargots gratiné. The snails were plump and to my liking. There was a little too much cheese for me and I had to dig through it to get to the snails. Luckily for my mom, this meant she got to pick at all my leftover fromage. She quite enjoyed this appetizer.   Before the mains were served, our waitress brought over fresh house salad (this is included with all meals regardless of whether you choose à la carte or not). The salad was crisp and fresh, and the dressing, though creamy, was super light and tasty. Great way to prepare my belly for what was coming!  Since I'm not really a meat eater, I ordered the butterfly shrimp with vegetables and rice. The shrimp were perfectly grilled and the accompanying garlic butter added that perfect touch to complete the foodgasm experience. The vegetables were perfectly cooked - from what I could see, these were fresh and not frozen. The rice was good - I would have liked a little more flavor but no complaints. My only comment about the overall dish is that the veggies and rice could have been hotter.  Two members of my party had the ribs and home fries, and all I kept hearing was how finger-licking good the ribs were. I snuck a few fries and they were equally great. Not at all greasy - perfectly crisp on the outside. Another person at my table ordered the rib steak and sung its praises. You can't go wrong with any meat dish!   The only thing that didn't blow us away were the desserts. The selection that came with the Table d'Hôte was pretty ordinary - the cheesecake seemed a bit dry and it lacked flavour (I had the blueberry variety). The cheesecake that my brother ordered looked stale and it was visibly dry. I think the dessert selection could have been refreshed for New Year's Eve.  Price point: Considering portion sizes, what was included with each meal, and food quality, I think Rio's prices are very fair. For about $30, you'll get the soup + appetizer + salad + main + dessert + coffee/tea on the Table d'Hôte. A full rack of ribs with home fries and salad will run you $32 and this includes the $5 surcharge to share the dish.   Final thoughts: Rio is a great place to check out if you love ribs and chicken. Book in advance if you want to go on a weekend because these guys are popular in these parts! Also, a quick shout-out to Rio's owner, Mitchell, who is nothing short of awesome. He wasn't there when we went for dinner, but I had the opportunity to meet him when I was checking out the menu a few weeks ago. All smiles and welcoming attitude. Love it."}
{"text":"Meilleures côtes levées!! Nous avons eu une superbe expérience, l'atmosphère est magnifique. Mon chum a prit le filet mignon et crevette et la cuisson était parfaite. Je vais revenir c'est certain :)"}
{"text":"It's real good food. However, customer service is not their strength. Waiting to be seated is extremely difficult. If you are two, you won't be seated on a larger table (table of 4 per se). The boss prefer make you wait standing on the side walk for 30-45 minutes than loose their larger table."}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant because it was close to St Sauveur ski hill and we heard they had great ribs.  A few from our group did order the ribs and home made tomatoe soup and loved it. The service was top notch and the restaurant felt like home. Highly recommend and special thanks to Francine R who was exceptional.  She went out of her way to ensure our group was comfortable and taken care of despite it being super busy.  Would definitely go back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Très fréquenté, ambiance u, nourriture facile et bien préparée, sans prétention, prix très corrects.  La carte des vins est limitée mais on trouve quand même un choix pour accompagner son plat.  Le service est sympathique mais pas toujours coordonné."}
{"text":"Best ribs and atmosphere you will find!  The food is fantastic and the owners treated us like we were family.  This was one of the best dining experiences we have had.  Do yourself a favor and go!  Get the ribs and french fries!!!!"}
{"text":"They messed up our 3 week long reservation. We were celebrating 2 anniversaries and they told us we have 1 and a half hour to eat and then we have to leave.  They called us the day of to tell us our restriction.   We asked for more time to eat and they would not accommodate. We left without eating. Very unprofessional for them to tell us the same day this."}
{"text":"I figured that we'll never get in at the last minute on a Saturday night at 8:00 pm. I was wrong. I called, they said it was no problem, and my son and I were seated immediately upon arrival. Our waitress was very friendly and quite charming in her effort to accommodate our need to communicate in English. We ordered the calamari, caesar salad, and each ordered a plate of ribs. The food was very good, except for the ribs... which were simply outstanding. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The ribs were delicious. The fries were dark and crispy. Very friendly staff.  I would have liked a larger serving size, but otherwise we were satisfied."}
{"text":"Read the reviews on Yelp and decided to try this restaurant. We were a group of 8 people on a Friday night, and were seated near the door, early December.   I recall being really cold and having to wear my winter jacket for half the meal at least. Most of us ordered the ribs, and it was good, without saying that it was the best ones I ever had. We were served in a timely good manner, even though we were a big group. Reserve in advance, if not you may have surprises.  I liked that it was not a chain, but a family-owned business in a homey-feeling wood-based restaurant. You get home-made salad that is included, which was crisp and good. The service was friendly too. If you go there, have either the ribs or the chicken, I guess you cannot go wrong (one of my friend had the chicken and said it was really good)."}
{"text":"Très chaleureux très bon service nous avons pris du spaghetti et des cote lever les cotes lever étais un peu piquante pour ma conjointe mais très bon et le spaghetti étais très bon je le recommande"}
{"text":"Life is full of surprises , specially when it comes to falling in love , yup today I fall in love with Rio restaurant , as we all know most of the restaurants in the area are not that good most of them they are average restaurants, but not RiO you have to try there ribs it is one of the best in Quebec it's so tasty so tender omg dream come true, owner is very polite servers are very professional , the owner is generous person he  served homemade fries to our 4 years old twins did not even charge, restaurant it self is cozy , only thing we did not like is the table covers ( sticky) but that's ok portions  are big and service is great , when it comes to ribs most of the time we go to Barbie barns on peel street if I have to compare my opinion RIO has a better ribs , so I suggest when you r up north go to RIO and have a Fiestaaaaa"}
