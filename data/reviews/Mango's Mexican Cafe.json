{"text":"I walked into Mango's when I first moved to Arizona.  I met up some friends here who grew up in Arizona and said this place was awesome.  I don't know if it was awesome but I was soooo hungry.  I ordered the killer burrito.  It was actually realllly good but I don't know if I would call it a killer burrito.  I'm from California and when you go to a Mexican place and order something called a 'killer burrito' it usually comes out the length of my arm. Anyhow, Mango's killer burrito was quite small in size but still good...but it was over priced.  Nothing wowed me here and I haven't really found my way back there.  My roommate ordered a quesdilla and she did NOT like it.  I would definitely pass on that. I think it might have been the grease but she said at one point it tasted like chinese food? No thanks."}
{"text":"My wife and myself both got food poisoning from this place. Worst case of food poisoning I've ever had !!!! Use caution"}
{"text":"come here frequently but first time yelping the place. Simple menu but good fresh food and service. Prices a little high, but it isn't fast food either.  Chips and salsa are very good as is the carne asada."}
{"text":"This our go to place for damn good homestyle Mexican food!  No frills at this small dive BUT you will not be disappointed.  My fave is the carne asada tacos.  Love, love, love!  Oh and THE BEST chips and salsa in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Great food, service, and prices.  Went to a few others in the area and I keep coming back to this one.  The shrimp burrito is pretty good as well!"}
{"text":"Not the very best burritos, staff not very friendly, had no customer service skills! Never going there again."}
{"text":"What a nice place to sit and what he people. The food was fresh and delicious. Staff was friendly. Will definitely go back again"}
{"text":"This was great local Mexican food. The yelp site said was table service but ordered at counter, from then on they delivered. We all enjoyed our entrees. I had chicken chimachanga. The meat was melting tender. And the flan was to die for. I felt like I was visiting Mexico. Rustic looking, no alcohol. Only disappointment. Will return"}
{"text":"Love Mangos! Great Mexican food!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite go-to Mexican restaurants in downtown Mesa. Very friendly staff, wonderful fish tacos."}
{"text":"First I'll start by saying that the food was ok and nothing special.  The chips are served room temp/cold, but the salsa is pretty good if mild.  Wife had shrimp enchiladas which were tasty but my steak fajitas were almost flavorless - I think they didn't season the meat at all.  Kids had standard beans and rice with a cheese quesadilla (no kids burgers and fries here by the way). They also took awhile to bring a high chair out (not until after we ordered up front) and the tables are tiny.  We also ordered desserts but a good 20 minutes after finishing our meal, the staff still hadn't cleared our table and brought them.  My wife flagged one down and asked and minutes later still nothing. I went to question the owner and he had the gall to say \"we are really busy, you should have told us when you're ready for dessert.\"  Pretty much a direct quote, no apology or anything.  He angrily asked me if I wanted a refund (all of this in front of a line of customers too).  Of course I took the money and got the hell out - this place will never get another dime from me, but Mesa seems to be content with the average fare and bad service."}
{"text":"Trust the reviews. So good!  And a street zydeco band playing on the sidewalk seating!  Did I say trust the reviews?  This place is really great!"}
{"text":"Honestly I crave this food whenever I am in this area of Mesa. Love the aqua fresca and the variety of authetic mexican food. Great salsa, fast service and Great Food!"}
{"text":"We came here since it was near the Mesa arts center. What a huge treat and surprise! Authentic delicious food! Awesome service! What an awesome find!"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I went to Mangos and it was my first time. When ordering I had a few questions and the gentlemen was very rude. I ordered a chicken chimichanga. I took two bites and did not like it but the rice and beans were really good. I asked the waiter if I could trade out my chimichanga for a regular burrito. The waiter stated \"well isn't that what you ordered.\" My coworkers did not enjoy their burritos due to them being dry. The owner came out to speak with us and was really defensive and rude. He didn't let my coworker talk and kept interrupting. I politely asked to trade my burrito and he kept rambling on about how ALL of his food is good and no one ever complains. When I finally got my replacement burrito it had nothing inside except meat and it was cold.   Due to the horrible customer service I decided not to complain and just left.   Worse $14 I've ever spent.   On a good note the chips and salsa was really good but not worth the rude management."}
{"text":"Took family from east coast here! They loved it go here everytime I'm in the area there fish tacos are awesome I recommend this restaurant to everybody I know!"}
{"text":"looove Mangos! one of the best things about mesa!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Mexican food fan and Mango's is tops with me! The enchilladas are delicious and the restaurant seriously has the best chips and salsa in the Valley. I'm also a fan of the agua frescas. I recommend the watermelon or mango."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food, very authentic. Everything is very good and inexpensive..I will continue to visit this restaurant often. Very polite and excellent service."}
{"text":"Mango's is the closest Mexican food to work. On days like today where I have back to back conference calls, a quick take away lunch is called for.  But boy was I disappointed today. Ordered a carne asada quesadilla, $9.50. While the tortilla is large and crispy, meat certainly plentiful, there was very little cheese. A good 2 inch outer edge with nothing but crispy tortilla. Cut back on the meat count and assure the whole tortilla is covered in cheese, please."}
{"text":"Good salsa and super crispy thick chips, with that alone Mangos (along with the other De La Cruz restaurants) is worth it for breakfast, lunch or dinner.   Their Comida Norteno is typical with cheese, refried beans and tacos. The portions are a good size, the food is flavorful, but not too greasy, cheesy or saucy. I think it's all quite delicious.   Expect them to be busy at lunch. So if you can swing an 11:30 or 12:45 lunch slot you'll have less crowds to deal with."}
{"text":"Mangos has a great staff and great food  I went with my little one and had a very comfortable experience thanks mangos"}
{"text":"Located in downtown, Mango's is the place for green chili burros in Mesa. The owner welcomes us each visit warmly. The  space is bright and colorful with lively music filling the air. We've always found the space clean, tables cleared off, with a generous outside dining area. Chairs aren't as comfy as I like when porking down some green chili, but the mural above quickly distracts you. Ordering at the counter, chips and salsa quickly arrives as you select your table with open seating. Staff is responsive with water and refills, with your order arriving in a timely manner. It is our Mexican food go to in Mesa."}
{"text":"Salty and bland. Hard to have both at the same time but they managed. Way overpriced and no tortilla substitutions allowed (corn instead of flour)."}
{"text":"Great food!  Had the carne asada plato special which was really tasty! Friend had Killer Burrito off menu which he loved. Service was so so. The man at the register was fantastic. Drinks not refilled and no one came back to check on us. All forgivable.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm taking an art class at Mesa Center for the Arts and come here to get dinner once a week for a few weeks and I quite enjoy it. The service is excellent and the manager, David recognized me after just two visits. The food is also very good. I recommend the carne asada tacos and the killer burro is amazing with some carne asada. Make sure to stop by if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. Tonight was my second visit to mangos. Had the Killer burrito and walked away full. Only downside is the lack of ability to accommodate a group bigger then four people at one table."}
{"text":"Food was like back home (NM & El Paso, TX)! They had delicious homemade chips and homemade salsa. We ate everything! Cute decor as well. I will definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! The chicken chimichanga was juicy and delicious. Fresh strawberry  lemonade to top it off. The best part was Paul. He was a kind gentleman who gave recomendations that were amazing. He also was fine with my many modifications. He will make your visit 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Delicious salsa, nachos, Agua frescas and more. The food is always fresh and I love the way they cook the chicken. Be careful going during an event on Main Street, this place gets very crowded! The seating leaves much to be desired. With round table pushed together for big parties, it can be a bit awkward. Also if you sit at the tables against the west wall you will have people bumping into you while they wait in line to order. Still fast service and quality food even when busy."}
{"text":"The food was just ok nothing I would go back for on a regular basis I had the killer burrito and it wasn't rolled very tight and I asked for no sour cream  they gave me extra. The service was good"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite places to eat! Their tortillas are amazing. The burritos and quesadillas are all so good. Sometimes my husband and I just split the nachos and it's plenty of food. Absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  It was just what we were looking for after a long day in the car.  The guys who work there were funny and polite - and the food was amazing.  And yes, the salsa was out of this world!"}
{"text":"I ordered a torta and a taco with chips and salsa, both were very good.  The Staff was also friendly."}
{"text":"I always make flan for my son on his birthday and we think my recipe is great- but I am in California and my son is at CRAS and  so I ordered flan for my son to pick up on his birthday and enjoy with his classmates. This flan got RAVE reviews and my son disclosed to my husband that this was better than mine! Thank you OMAR for making his birthday so special even when his family cannot be there to help him celebrate! Next visit, MANGOS is my TO- DO list!"}
{"text":"Hurry up and get to Mangos!  You're missing out if you've never been.  The flavors are incredible.  Best chips and salsa in town!  We live in Anthem and the drive is so worth it."}
{"text":"I always order the carne asado burrito whenever I see it on a menu. Gave this one a whirl and was quite pleased with it. Add in the chips and salsa and I was a happy man."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever. Everything on the menu has been very good.  Plenty of flavor and meats are always tender. The flan is excellent to top it off. Everyone that works here are very friendly and quick."}
{"text":"I come here a lot because it's close to work...the chips & salsa are the best. I can only brag about the shrimp burrito as that's the only thing I ever order from here. I love anything with shrimp & their tortillas are bomb.com  Maybe one day I'll branch out and try something new."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since they opened and mangos never disappoints! The chips and salsa are to die for, and everything on the menu is delicious. The bean and cheese burrito, chicken soft tacos, street tacos, rice, beans and fresh juice are just a few of my favorites! The staff is always friendly and welcoming. It's truly a gem of downtown!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is delicious and the staff really nice. I eat here about once a week. Anything shrimp is great. The veggie burro yummy. The fruit drinks are to die for. Get a pint of salsa to go. You'll never buy a jar at the supermarket again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Portion sizes are great. Their salsa is absolutely amazing! I usually try something different each time and I've yet to be disappointed. Depending on what's going on in downtown, the wait and seating can be difficult but it's a great location and atmosphere."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC food!  Reasonable prices.  Chips & Salsa absolutely the best!  I had the street tacos, husband had the Carne Asada burrito, another in our group had the Tilapia tacos, and one had the Killer Burrito w/shredded beef.  All thought it was great - the only down side is that we couldn't get Margaritas to go with our meal. Oh well, not that big of a deal.  Would definitely return again next time we travel through Mesa.  :-)"}
{"text":"This place is Okay. Not delicious, and not disgusting. Its whatever. My quesadilla  was good for the first couple bites.. then it started tasting like Chinese food. Weird? Whatev, I killed it cuz I had a long drive home. My friend had a \"Killer Burrito\" and she enjoyed it! I guess it depends on what you get.  Oh also it seemed a little over priced (minus another star for that).. I got a quesadilla with guacamole and sour cream, and a Jarrito for 14 dollars! wtf.. are there taco trucks in Arizona?"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Mexican restaurant!! Everything is good and the service is awesome! My favorite items are the cheese enchiladas and the fish burrito!! So glad to find out they're open til 9pm now!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time coming here and everything was phenomenal! We had the nachos machos with beef and it was super tender, chips were crispy not soggy.  My husband had the al pastor burrito and it was delicious, I had the carne asada street tacos.  Everything we tried had a different sauce/ flavor to it and we practically licked our fingers .  The service was top notch, this place is very authentic and is definetly our new favorite Mexican, we will most definetly be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by because we were checking out the venues for our 2015 wedding and we were hungry. At first I thought the prices were a bit high, we ordered some fajitas, but when we got our dish I was surprised at how much food there was on the plate. It was also very delicious. The service was not too bad either as its pay first then eat. I will definetly come again."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I was here for a lunch meeting and was treated but I believe for the 3 of us the bill came out to $40 if you're trying to estimate cost. Note we were here on a Monday and they close at 4:00 pm on Monday's.   There was ample seating inside, but I can see it hard to grab a seat during the lunch rush.   They have your standard mexican dishes. I was craving some tacos so I ordered the Al Pastor Taco combo with beans and rice. I was hardly able to finish but it was too good to leave left overs. The chips and salsa were yummy too. Interestingly enough they were lacking hot sauce options and brought out a small condiment cup of Tapatio when I asked for some.   Everyone else seemed to tear up their food as well and seemed satisfied. Reason for the 4 stars then? It's not the best mexican food I've had, so I have to save the 5 stars for my favorite places, but for a lot of people this is a 5 star place."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Seriously, the best carne asada burrito I've ever had....  Their chips and salsa are good too, but you WILL have dragon breath for the rest of the day - just a warning.  I need to try something else on the menu, but I can't help but be lured by the siren song of carne asada!  When I brought a friend he got the carne asada tacos and a watermelon agua fresca.  He says that he's dreamt about that drink ever since."}
{"text":"The Killer Burrito was good, the taco salad was good, the meat is very good, but the service is somewhat lacking. They pretend like they don't take credit/debit cards, but that's not true. My main complaint was that they don't have a menu online, so I had to call my to-go order in and guess at what I wanted. They never told me the Killer Burrito came with red or green chili. I would have liked the chance to ask for red if I had known there was a choice. Also, the sour cream in the burrito was all at one end.   Their prices are more expensive than you'd expect, their service isn't as attentive as you'd expect, but if you're flexible on cost and service then their food is pretty good. I'll probably go back again but I won't ever become a regular. Once in a great while is enough for me. The good parts for me was the somewhat crispy tortilla on my burrito, and both my GF and I liked their shredded beef a lot."}
{"text":"First time and was not disappointed at all! The chips and salsa was good. The service was great and  have to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Every time I go here I'm surprised people like it so much. It's bland food. The ambiance is only satisfactory because it's off of Main Street, but I hate how crammed in you always feel. The service is better than most though. The people are consistently helpful and grateful for your business."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food! Chips were fresh made meat was tender and flavorful it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while showing my mom around Mesa and am so glad I did. The food was great, service fast and the staff were really nice.   I got the pork taco special and a shredded beef taco. They each had a large portion of meat and the seasoning was delicious. My mom had the shrimp taco and shredded chicken taco. She loved them both, but said the shrimp taco was the best.   Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Just walking by. Great food. Great service. Great atmosphere. Prices unbelievably reasonable.Really enjoyed our first time here. Owner very friendly. You have to check it out!"}
{"text":"This is not the first time I have been to Mangos Mexican restaurant, but it will be my LAST. My young daughter ordered a chicken quesadilla, she did not order it plan and it came with other things on it as stated in the menu. But they would not remake it without charging us for another one. The Menus are so small and hard to read. They Hurd customers thru so fast. Taking someone else's order before you are even done.  The ordering was a mistake on our part but because they did not want to make it right for my daughter so she could enjoy her dinner out. They lost a long time customer."}
{"text":"My girlfriend & I just moved here about 2 years ago from San Antonio after being there for 30 years.  Let me tell you that there are literally hundreds of Mexican restaurants in that city & about 90% of them are 5 STAR quality in terms of taste.  I grew up in that city & at now that I am 32 & away from there, I've have grown to appreciate great food.  Arizona, or maybe more specifically the Phoenix Metro area, (I don't know), has Mexican restaurants that just plain suck compared to San Antonio restaurants.  Yeah there are a few good ones here & there like Aunt-Chiladas, Arribas, & La Fondas, but nothing can beat Mangos.  Their Spanish rice is not like those other restaurants.  I don't know what they put in that rice that makes it taste not so good, but Mangos skips that ingredient & what we have here is a gold mine.   All of their meats taste as if they were marinated overnight or something.  Too good.  I work at the Wells Fargo building about a half a mile away & was here for almost a year before a new guy who started working in my office decided to let me in on downtown Mesa's little secret.  I had no clue what I was in for when we went there to take out for lunch.  Incredible food.   Free chips.  Salsa that does NOT have stupid jalapeno seeds.  Not everyone likes freaking hot stuff, Arizona!  I remember ordering over the phone a simple bean & cheese burrito.  Nothing more.  The guy TOTALLY got me.  The reason I made that known is because I still can't get over the experience I had at another joint called Filberto's.  Oh my God, this place is the pits.  I decided to try it against my girlfriends recommendation not to.  I should have listened to her.  I went there to order a simple bean & cheese taco & the guy looked at me with a blank stare.   Then I said it in Spanish so maybe he could understand more.  He shrugged his shoulders. Guy didn't have a clue!  Getting off topic so moving on...  My whole point was that Mangos understands me!    In response to the chick from LA, I agree with almost everything you said, except two things: you said that we should grow up & order big boy food.  I couldn't give two craps about all that hogwash.  I'll order what I want to order.  I do not want big boy food.  If that means I want little boy food, then WTH is the problem.  I'm not into all that macho bull*** that 90 percent of Americans swear by.  I'm the anti-macho if you couldn't already tell by my wording of this incredibly long review this is starting to become.  :-)   I grew up on plain old boring bean & cheese tacos & burritos, so chew on that.  I'll eat those things til I reach 100 years old & beyond..  Guaranteed.  All I know is that Mangos delivers.  Not literally, but you know.   Also if there is something wrong with me for wanting simple food, then SO BE IT.  Skilled or not, anyone in the Mexican food business, should be able to understand frijoles con queso!  Again, my point being that MANGOS UNDERSTANDS ME.  & maybe I'm a little boring when it comes to food.  When I ordered my bean & cheese burrito, I asked the guy to not put in pico-de-gallo which is the little onions, tomatoes, & other green stuff that die hard Mexican-food lovers like.  He said that was fine.  He didn't even sweat it.  Then I told him to put in some beef.  Oh man, was that a meal.  Just that burrito alone made me full all the way from lunch until it was time to eat my midnight snack.  I was not hungry that WHOLE time.  This should tell you how large these things are & how filled they make them.  The insides are busting out of the lovely flour tortilla.    This place deserves 5 stars for sure.  Excellent place to eat.  Yelpers, eat here to have a great Mexican meal & be full for hours & hours. Mangos, thank you for giving me my Mexican food I remember from my hometown.  :-)"}
{"text":"I have been going to Mango's for years! The food is great! The service is great as well! I have never left Mango's feeling disappointed or ripped off! Everything i have gotten there has been great! It can get really croweded during the lunch and dinner rushes, so if you are short on time watch out! They also ONLY accept cash, i think they just started that just recently, a friend had to spot me last time because i didn't have any cash, so make sure you bring cash!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Small, casual setting. Great for families. No liquor license."}
{"text":"Mangooooooooo! - a line I remember from SNL.   I have been trying to go to Mango's for about 10 years. What took me so long, well I don't get to Mesa much. I was happy I finally did. The interior is a old school mexican food shop. It is counter service but they bring you chips and salsa, food and refill your drinks.   We ordered the fish taco's (wow what a kick, these bad boys were spicy) and the carne asada burrito. The fish was really good and nice presentation with chunks of avocado and mandarin orange salsa on top. The burrito was plain looking but the flavors locked inside were awesome.  The chips were thick and crunchy and the salsa was rated at 3 bowls before the food arrived.  I will definitely return to this \"gem\" in downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"Always enjoy meeting city employees for lunch at Mango's!  Selection is truly amazing! I do not eat pork; hence, I so appreciate the ability to substitute chicken at this cute venue! The staff are exceedingly pleasant!"}
{"text":"While I still haven't found a cheap Mexican place that compares to those in Chicago, or, say... Mexico, Mango's is a nice place to come for a burrito. And their aguas frescas are really amazing (my favorite is the canteloupe). The enchiladas are pretty typical -- lots and lots of cheese, rice and beans. But the thing that really stands out here are the burritos 'enchilada style.' The basically take the burrito and smother it in sauce and some cheese. It's delicious! I came here yesterday with a coworker and bought the veggie burrito ($4.75) enchilada-style (extra $1.75). It was tasty and fresh-- full of crumbly white cheese, chunks of avocado, onion, rice, beans and fresh jalepenos.   Antoher thing I like about this place is that, if you come during lunchtime, you'll actually feel like you're in a \"real\" city - the tables are crowded, both insdie and outside the buildling, it's loud, there's a mix of business people and families - It's unusual for Mesa, and its really nice."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this downtown Mesa eatery. They always have fresh fruit juices and their food is full of flavor. I asked for a hotter Salsa and the reply was not okay but how hot, they then delivered a tasty but very spicy salsa. We go here often and highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"I'm a newbie to the Mesa area, and I've been on the hunt for places to go during my lunch hour. Once my co-workers introduced me to Mango's  I was hooked. This is a perfect place for lunch in downtown Mesa. The service is super friendly and fast, so it's easy for me to get in and out if I'm busy. Their menu is yummy and authentic. I always leave here feeling satisfied and each dish is very reasonably priced. As a result, this spot has become a regular in my lunch destination rotation.  The tacos, tostadas and burittos are some of the highlights on Mango's menu. I can't even begin to pick a favorite because eveytime I try something new I'm happily surprised! They have tons of options, too. I'm dangerously addicted to their endless chips and salsa, and their guacamole is delicious. So, if your find yourself in Mesa and you're looking for food, you simply can't go wrong here. Mango's is great!"}
{"text":"Mango's has excellent  mexican food.  Beans are superior too.  Could a bean really create such fan-fare? YESSSS! But what is not creating so much fan-fare is the prices!  I had to be objective here & take Mangos down a notch/Star,,the prices are expensive. & the plates go through some kind of shrinking machine too. Getting sick of being gouged"}
{"text":"How can you not like this place?  It is in a great location in downtown Mesa.  It has inside and outside seating.  It has a diverse menu.  The service is great in the form it is delivered - you order at the counter and they bring it to you.  My experience was a bit different.  I ordered a Killer Burrito and took it home and put it in the refrigerator for consumption the next morning before participating in the Tour de Mesa - a 72 mile bike ride north and east of Mesa.  Even the next morning, the burrito was tasty, fresh and filled with all kinds of delicious goodies.  I got chicken for the meat choice and it was grilled just right and was of high quality.  The staff at Mango's are very friendly and seem to welcome everyone as if they had been there 100 times.  Of particular note was the number of single diners above 50 years of age.  This indicates to me that the food is healthy and reasonably priced and the restaurant provides a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night. Super friendly staff that are working hard!! Never saw them rest one minute and always had a smile on their face. Food was pricier than I hoped for but was very delicious. I'm super sensitive to spicy flavor so the food was on the hotter side but was flavorful at the same time."}
{"text":"Chicken burrito and bean and cheese burrito are very good, but if you're getting them to go, be prepared for some mess, especially if they are placed vertically in a bag, wrapped not in aluminum foil but in paper. Chicken is good quality, with chopped up tomato/salsa inside.  Chips and salsa are quite good, but chips were inexplicably placed loose in the to-go bag on top of the burritos, requiring some messy digging to get to the burritos.  Mangos' staff is very courteous."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food in Mesa!  I've been here a couple times and have always liked what I ordered.  My favorite dish is the Killer burrito, enchilada style (green sauce).  I like that you order and pay at the counter and then find a seat and they deliver the food.  The service is pretty quick even when they get busy during lunch and dinner times.  They are within walking distance of the Mesa Arts Center.  You can easily park at the MAC, walk to dinner, and then walk back for a show.  The only negative is that they only accept cash, so make note of that before you go!"}
{"text":"Good stuff. Had the tilapia taco special. Came with rice and beans. Also had Agua fresca mango mixed with strawberry. Nice atmosphere. They have outdoor and indoor seating."}
{"text":"I like this place on Main Street, has indoor and outdoor seating, I love the chimichanga...I add grilled vegetables and extra cheese yummy!!! Fun place lots to choose from great prices."}
{"text":"Great, fast option in downtown Mesa. They have unique non-alcoholic drink options and the chimichangas are amazing. There are a few patio tables that offer nice views of the downtown area."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times, enjoyed everything I had, so did my dinning companions, but one got very ill after he left here , and was fine 24 hours later.......hummm........."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is really good, the wait staff is nice and friendly. They need a bigger restaurant because this place gets packed, but it's worth the wait. The salsa is so good. I enjoy the tacos and they include onions with the cheese enchiladas. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is super fast and has some pretty great food. The chips and salsa were fresh and unexpected. It's a little interesting in how you order. You place your order at the counter and have a seat, inside or out, and they bring you your drinks, chips and salsa then your food. Great portions and great price. Cute restaurant and nice folks work here! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Terrific service and wonderful food.  Loved the salsa, shrimp taco and marinated pork tacos. Will go back if we are in Mesa again."}
{"text":"We were downtown Mesa enjoying the sunshine and didn't quite feel like eating but we were in the mood for a nice cold drink. We came to mangoes and inside they have fresh juices from watermelon, cantaloupe, strawberries and lemonade. I got a large watermelon juice, it was delicious. It was almost as though I stuck the straw right into a watermelon to suck the juice out, it was so refreshing. We had a seat on the outside patio and just sat and enjoyed the sunshine."}
{"text":"This place ROCKS.  My family showed up, a dozen of us or so, without warning on a Saturday evening and the owner/manager (whoever he was) was so gracious to accommodate us.  The food was really good and the atmosphere lively.  In spite of our sizeable group and a humongous group that came in just after us they still got our food out to our tables in a reasonably short time, hot and delicious.  They kept our chips and salsa (very good salsa, by the way) replenished throughout our stay.  We left happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"Have always had a great experience in the past during the daytime.   We arrived at 8:50PM and we were told told they were closed.  He said the restaurant closes at 9PM.   Can't believe an employer would turn away business during normal operating hours.   Not pleased and will most likely not return based on my evening experience."}
{"text":"The only reason to come here is if you are going to the theater and every other place is full! The food is better at Alberto's just not as Convenient. The food was bland, boring and prepared by uninspired kitchen help not a chef. We would not return. Trust the people who gave this place a mediocre rating! They are correct."}
{"text":"I had the fried ground beef tacos!!! They were delicious!! The salsa is addicting!! They have aquas frescas made fresh daily!! The staff was friendly gave great recommendations!! If you have been here you need to come check it out!! Little spot it downtown Mesa!!"}
{"text":"This place is just ok. Came here for lunch during the week since I was in the area. I ordered the shrimp tacos combo with rice and beans. Shrimp are pretty darn small, but at least tacos were well seasoned. The tacos were served double tortilla style, which would be fine if the tortillas were better. The tortillas are regular grocery style ones. Rice and beans are under seasoned.   I ordered a limón agua fresca/limeade. This was actually pretty great! Also ordered a flan. This was pretty good too, although would be better if they skipped on the chocolate syrup and whip cream. Neither complemented the flan at all. So I just pushed these \"garnishes\" to the side.  If I'm I the area again I may stop and eat here if I'm really hungry. Otherwise, I don't see myself making the drive out here. This place has potential, but tweaks need to be made soon!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever tasted!  Salsa is excellent as well.  Nice very small indoor and outside seating that can get over crowded."}
{"text":"Yummy. Delicious. Loved the meal! Loved the staff. It's officially my new standard for local authentic Mexican food, here in Mesa AZ. I shall definitely return for more!"}
{"text":"Best carne asada in Mesa for sure. Shrimp tacos are awesome as well. Staff is great."}
{"text":"Really nice local restaurant, give them a try if you're looking for good Mexican.  I ordered the carne asada burrito, enchilada style, with a large soda, the total was $10.85.  I left another $2 at the table bringing the total to $12.85.  Good bargain since I still have half the burrito left.  And free chips and salsa.  The carne asada has good flavor, and they mixed in chopped up peppers and cilantro which gave it that extra level of flavor.  I love me some carne asada but too many restaurants just put meat into a tortilla and call it a day.  This one struck a nice \"freshness\" balance with just that small addition.  Very friendly staff, plenty of parking in the rear, free refills on sodas.  Order at the counter, then get table service after.  Good place for families."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love this place. Fantastic food. Sometimes it's all we crave.   Great decor and great personality.  I recommend the Veggie Burrito or Cheese Enchiladas?."}
{"text":"A good place to hang out and enjoy a filling and tasty Mexican meal. I enjoyed the upbeat music, delicious food, and overall enjoyable atmosphere. I'd come back again :-)"}
{"text":"Clicked on yelp to find a good Mexican restaurant and find this one. A bit pricey as we spent 30 for 2 for lunch but it was good."}
{"text":"Worst Service today by Owner!  Get it together!  Our order was wrong x2 people!! Waited 35 min for more chips, asked for refill 3 x times"}
{"text":"Mom and pop shop. Order from the counter and they bring it to you. Very tasty, cheap and fast. Had the crispy taco and cheese enchilada combo and carne asada fries. They do have out door seating and plenty of parking near by."}
{"text":"This place is popping today. Lots of space and good food. Place has been here a long time. Looks yummy"}
{"text":"This place is always crowded at lunch. The food is delicious and fresh. The fish tacos my fav! They are used to many at lunch so they are fast and efficient. Indoor outdoor seating.The staff is on top of topping of your drinks,cleaning up,just overall great dining experience.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Mondays are my day off. I live in Paradise Valley and come to Mesa every MON. I always stop @ Mangos and here's why,..  A- Great Food B- Fish Burritos C- Chips and Salsa are delishh!! D- Horchata is really good E- Eat outside,..(it's like you're in Europe)  The Manager/Owner went out of his way to make sure I was happy and I think that goes above and beyond. Lots of Restaraunts want people in get them out,..make $$. This place cares about keeping customers coming back."}
{"text":"I really liked Mango's. The food was good, and the environment was comfortable. I use chimichangas as a test of a Mexican food restaurant. I oredered a shredded beef Chimi, and it was great. The beef had lots of character and the sauce was unique - fruit and vegetable bits inside - I was pleasantly surprised.   The chips were very good - not too greasy. The sauce was alright - a little 'wet' for my taste.    The price was a little higher than I saw in other reviews. You're going to drop pretty close to $10 on any meal here.    All in all, while I may not make a trip just to come here (I live in West Phoenix), I would be happy to eat here if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place is really not good.  I'm really not sure why it is so highly praised.  I had the tilapia tacos, a Senorial Sangria, and the flan.  The tacos, at a somewhat steep $10 or so, were the most bland fish tacos I've had in awhile.  Toppings?  Nothing.  Just some cilantro or something; not even any cabbage or sauce.  Tia Rosa's Tacqueria has far superior fish tacos for a smaller price.  The rice that came on the plate was bland, but that's OK, because it's rice, and you don't expect much from that.  The refried beans were lousy and had no flavor.  The flan was terribly disappointing.  It did not have that creamy flan texture, and was actually as firm as cheesecake.  The taste was very dull.  Maybe Mexican flan is supposed to be that way... if it is, pretty much every other country makes better flan.  I did enjoy the Senorial, but pretty much every Mexican joint these days serves that.  One thing they do deserve props for is the service.  Considering how crowded the place was, they did an excellent job making sure there was water on the table, not messing up orders, etc."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Mexican restaurants of all time!! The carne Asada burrito is a favorite as well as the chicken tacos! The chips and salsa authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"Totally overrated. The meat is consistently dry and over salted. The salsa is no Bueno either. There are too many good Mexican restaurants within a mile of this place to bother stopping here."}
{"text":"I went in during the lunch hour, and though it was busy, the employees were attentive and my order did not take long to be ready. The food was delicious. I ordered the 3 street tacos combo. It was a great portion of delicious food for a great price!"}
{"text":"Be prepared to be overcharged. In addition to paying an arm and a leg for a breakfast burrito, I also had to deal with one of rudest staff members that works there! I would have kept paying their outrageous prices (I am a fan of supporting local businesses), but after being so rudely mistreated by their main staff member, I have not and will not visit again! I would also discourage others from going there, until Mangos rethinks their prices.. and hires new and friendlier (English-speaking) staff!"}
{"text":"There is not much in downtown mesa that is not closed, closing, or newly opened. Most shops in dowtown mesa last a few months at best then fold up. Mango's is an exception to the rule. They have been there a while, the food is excellent, the price is inexpensive, service fast and freindly, and the outside seating is nice. Check this place out, its pretty much your only choice in downtown mesa, but it's still pretty good!"}
{"text":"A very traditional, old fashioned Mom & Pops run Mexican restaurant. It's small in there but they have a few seats outside,  useable only on non-sweltering Phoenix days.   Newcomers note - there is no Hostess. You have to go to the counter and order. But David (owner?) Will gladly make a recommendation as he did to me.  I got the Burrito stuffed with shreaded beef, rice and beans. He then recommended Christmas style, meaning dressed in red and green chilies. It was a really good, tasty and large burrito. Their chips are homemade and delicious. While their salsa was decent it was a little watery for my taste. I prefer a chunky style and a little more heat.  Overall a good choice for solid Mexican food in Downtown Mesa.  Oh they don't take Amex."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Friendly staff and fresh Mexican food.  Had the sizzling steak fajitas on corn tortillas and horchata.  David is the friendly manager - makes everyone feel at home.  Been going here for years now - when I am in town for business and staying at the Marriott Mesa.  Walking distance - nice walk.  Hit the arts center or the comics shop next door to get your Dr Who fix on."}
{"text":"I came in today, 10/27/14, because I had been here before and enjoyed the food, but it had been a while since I've been here. The timeliness of the orders is good, but the quality is standard, my Horchata, which is my favorite drink aside from eggnog and root beer, wasn't very good it was watery and disappointing and the food wasn't really worth the $13 I paid for a chicken burrito. I did appreciate one of the employees (manager or owner maybe?) thanking me for remembering Mango's from two years ago, but they need to step their game up. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"Mango's is one of a kind. The food is always fresh and the service is a big part of why I go back. This is a craving kind of place. The shrimp burrito is my favorite!"}
{"text":"three words..... carne asada torta!!!!!!  oh yeah and their flan is some of the best."}
{"text":"I asked Siri for food near me and she directed me to Mango's Mexican Cafe ! I order the (2) Grilled Tilapia tacos w Rice & Beans , I loved it ! I will be returning definitely   David provided excellent customer service   I paid $10 and was well satisfied"}
{"text":"I've been to Mangoes quite a few times now and have not had anything yet that wasn't good. I love the tilapia tacos. Service is excellent. Fun place to sit, eat and people watch!"}
{"text":"A nice place in downtown Mesa. Not always easy to find parking but worth it. My favorites are the breakfast burritos and some of brunch fair. There is always the to go option."}
{"text":"I had a chili Verde burrito, enchilada style with green sauce. It was delicious and the service was good too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm very picky when it comes to good Mexican food. I'm not a fan of TexMex... nor can I stand food so spicy I have to pop a couple Zantac's when I get home. If you're looking for amazing flavor at a reasonable price with a downtown feel... THIS IS THE PLACE! While we were in line to order we met a couple who has been eating at Mango's for the past 15 years! Now that's saying something!  I ordered the cheese enchilada and shredded beef taco and my husband had the same. The staff and people were so friendly and down to earth... I can definitely say we will be back again and again! Thank you Mango's! It was delicioso!"}
{"text":"This was my fave place to go after work (when I lived in Tempe & worked at Borders) and now I miss it so damn much.  Their tacos were just  the tops. 4 stars as once our server was just not on it.  But that was her fault."}
{"text":"Love their flour tortillas, decent amount for hand made on site take home and gobble up tortillas, yummy yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Ohhhh Maaaangos!!! I have been having a love affair with this place for about 10 years. It has NEVER let me down. The chips are homemade and always fresh and warm, the salsa is super delicious. My favorites are the Veggie and Shredded beef burritos, the nachos are also crazy good. The service is awesome, I love all the people that work there..and they've all been working there a super long time!  The drinks are huge. The food is fresh. I can't say enough good about this place... Just go and see for yourself!!"}
{"text":"If you like authentic tasting mexican food you have to go here. I always get the chicken burrito, yummy! They also serve free chips and salsa which is a must when going to a Mexican restaurant. They are also very nice and friendly staff there, always remember us when we stop by. Just don't go during the rush lunch, everyone is there and you won't get a seat."}
{"text":"Great beans, chips and salsa are unreal!!!  Salsa is a bit hot but tasty.  Hard tacos are gourmet and delish!!!  Wife had the chicken tostada and mmmm'd every bite. First time here can't wait to come back!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy all the way.  Hard to get all the basics exactly right but Mangos has delicious beans, rice, tortillas, and the Carne asada is bomb.  Then to top it off they have the awesome fresh fruit drinks which are a highlight for me.  I like to mix them, strawberry with pineapple, mango, watermelon, they all make my mouth water.  Update*** Oh heck no...they started charging for chips and salsa.  So that $4 added with my $4 drink and $10 meal- $18 before Tip is pricey for what they are-an adorable tiny lunch spot that you sit at tiny patio tables.  Their food is good, but there are lots of good places when you put them up at that price level. Since we had to buy the chips we got the new queso fundido.  Waste of $.  Flavor was fine but it was melted cheese, we got a few stringy bites in before it was a block of cheese in a bowl that would just break the chip if you tried to dip.  For good queso hit café Rio."}
{"text":"Ay dios mio, the Chile Relleno was to die for! And homemade tortillas, yum. Solid fare in downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"Great fresh Mexican food in downtown Mesa. I love the green chili burritos. On cooler days I enjoy people watching on the patio area."}
{"text":"You know, downtown Mesa isn't half bad.  It is quaint and has some understated charm.  Mango's is the same way.  Aside from the kitschy tropical decor, the place has a comfortable feel and the Mexican standards are executed as well as any abuela.    They have some great dishes just beyond the realm of the traditional.  Their tilapia is mild and light, seasoned perfectly by the onion and cilantro.    There are so many other nooks of the Valley that get so much more attention.  Spend an evening in downtown Mesa and have your dinner at Mango's.  It will be pleasant, I promise."}
{"text":"It was after 5pm, I was hungry and seemed to be the only person walking down the lonely stretch of Main Street.  I noticed the Mexican restaurant called Mango's but I didn't have high hopes as the name brought to mind a boring Americanized menu with bad margaritas and table side mariachi music.  Hunger won out so I sat down to order the fish taco special.  Well, first impressions be damned.  The simple meal of grilled fish tacos, rice and beans made me think I was at a good street vendor stand in Mexico -- and I mean that in the best possible way.  The ingredients were traditionally authentic.  While I don't expect to find myself a frequent visitor to Mesa, I do plan to visit Mango's in the future when I pass through the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Even though my family and I can only make it about twice a year, the staff remembers us and we are treated as family. The chips are the best and we can't get away from the shrimp enchiladas and al pastor tacos. One of our absolute favorite places to eat.   We do really miss the old fun decor.  It really added to the ambience and made you feel like you were in Latin America."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best Mexican restaurants you can find in AZ! Now, its not the fanciest, most expensive, or anything like that, but their food is mind-blowing! Depending on when you go, you may be in for a bit of a wait because the restaurant is small, but it is well worth waiting for. When I worked at the Bank of America across the street, I made a trip to Mango's on a daily basis.   My favorite thing on their menu is their Chimichangas but everything is worth a taste. Their seafood tacos/burritos are delicious and you won't be able to find better fruit drinks anywhere!   The price is fair and you won't be sad that you dropped the money.   Beyond this, the staff is amazingly friendly. While they don't speak very good English, they make up for it in great service. The owner is also nearly always there and makes it a very great experience. Mango's is one of those places you can't just go to once. My taste buds still yearn for this food even though I am thousands of miles away!"}
{"text":"This was my second time eating here and both times the same young kid was rude! This time, I placed my order via online. When we got there, it was ready and he was getting our drinks. When we informed him that one of our drinks was wrong he got attitude and filled it half way and just ignored us when we asked to have it filled. We had to ask another employee to fill up our cup. I will not be returning. Maybe his attitude is why there are hardly any people in the establishment!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. The tacos are delicious as well their chips and salsa. Over the years, their prices have been climbing pretty steadily and for the amount of food you get I have always felt like their prices were way too high. But I like the food and out of habit I kept going back from time to time over the years. But today, I went in and I noticed that the prices have gone up by another dollar, and now they want to charge you for chips and salsa. Unfortunately, I think that was my last visit to mangos. With so many other options out there with equal or greater quality at a much lower price, (i'm looking at you backyard taco :-) I guess mangos doesn't want my business anymore. they are pricing them self way out of the market."}
{"text":"Went to Mango's again today, food is as good as I remember.  Had the Shrimp Burro and it was excellent.  There were 12 in our group and we had to sit outside on the benches, even with the wind blowing and the leaves falling down in our food at times, it was great.  The staff gladly grabbed us another table so we could at least all sit at a table.  Only reason they didn't get a 5 is because it is downtown Mesa and parking sucks."}
{"text":"Food-  Amazing nachos!  Best i've ever had.  Plenty of toppings, well worth the 9 dollars  Service-The guy behind the counter is very nice and makes excellent suggestions and remembers me every time I come in and asks how his suggestion panned out!  Ambiance-Nice little spot, nothing fancy"}
{"text":"The food was decent other than the brown/rotting avocados they served and said \"that's how they always are\".  I grew up in so cal with two huge avocado trees that produce 2000+ avocados a year and avocados aren't supposed to be brown.  It's also very cramped inside, almost no seating available, I think it maybe had seating for like 20 or so people at the most."}
{"text":"Good place for Mexican food on your lunch break. I would give it 5 stars but I had to wait a long time just to place an order. With just two people ahead of me it took 12mins before I could order. Tough when you have just a hour to get there, order, get your order, eat it, and drive or walk back to work. After ordering my food did not take long at all to receive. The food was good. Not the best but good. I would go there again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch on a Saturday.  The place was packed, but service was great.   Food was super.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Had a burrito with carne asada it was good. But when I put the salsa on it it was superb! Had just the right portion to fill me up! Great"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I was last here.. this being my 2nd visit I had high hopes. This visit did not live up  to my expectations. The line was long, about a 15 min wait.. still acceptable. My hubby found a small table inside for us to sit at. I wanted outside nut there us no ranle service out there.. i ordered a shredded beef chimichanga, A LA CARTE, no rice or beans, asked to add cheddar cheese inside since cheese is not part of the chimi. Hubby ordered a burrito , ground beef, combo platter. We sat down and waited.. since it was a Friday night, it took about 20 min for food to arrive. The waiter brought chips and salsa and our beverages.  My Dr.Pepper turned out to a diet coke.  Flagged our server and exchanged it.  The food finally arrived and my plate was just okay. The chimi was warm, greasy and soggy on bottom, there was also beans and rice on my plate (which I did not order). I accepted the plate because it wouls take far to ling to get it ecchanged. The shredded beef inside was sooooo powerful with garlic,  my hubby could smell it!! I love garlic but this was all I could taste and there was no cheddar cheese!! I picked at my plate but still could not finish it.   There was approx 50 % left that went to waste AND I HATE TO WASTE FOOD!!! not even able to box up and take home.  Maybe if I go back, I will go on a Sunday afternoon..  thank you."}
{"text":"Two beef enchiladas with beans and rice, and chips and salsa for myself was over fourteen dollars. The food was good but the salsa was short and not nearly enough. Apparently they're so expensive because now they're required to pay their employees a couple more bucks an hour. Please. And \"exceptional service?\" The guy taking my order didn't even acknowledge my presence until I made myself known, and even then he didn't look me in the eye."}
{"text":"Pros- the food is fresh and tasty and they're pretty quick in getting the food out. Cons- not the best customer service. Don't refer to the menu posted online, the prices are the old ones, and when I went to pay for the food, I ended up having to pay for the newer prices. I told them they should upload an accurate pricing of their menu, but they said they didn't know how . . .so I don't know. It's a hit and miss. One time I wasn't able to pay with card and another time I could, I never know what to expect on any given day."}
{"text":"If you go, try the carne asada street tacos. Love that they have fountain drinks and 20 oz. Pepsi products. The owner is kind and helpful and the bus man is awesome. He's happy to give extra help if you always forget to get your side of sour cream before your food comes out! Who me?!? :)"}
{"text":"Great little quick Mexican food spot in downtown Mesa friendly service nice atmosphere air-conditioning, air-conditioning air-conditioning... Yes 106° outside."}
{"text":"Great food first of all! Prices are good and the interior and exterior are clean. This place is great and even though had a long line, we got our food pretty quick. A must stop and eat place if your in Mesa!!!!"}
{"text":"Good real Mexican food, glad to see local restaurants are still thriving in this economy, would definitely go back here!"}
{"text":"This place gets better every time we come here! Normally I am a carne asada enthusiast but today I was extremely pleased to enjoy the pollo asada! The flavor is awesome and the jalapenos in the pico have a freshness that you don't get at too many Mexican food restaurants.  The chips and salsa are made in house, the salsa is fantastic!! All the people who work there are very friendly.  They have seasonal fruit beverages that are out of this world!! Made fresh with no added sugar!! YUM!! I love Mango's!"}
{"text":"Went to Mangos for the first time last Saturday, and love, love, loved it. Chips and salsa were great and the chorizo and eggs was amazing. The beans were the best I've ever had. The place is worth a shot and my wife and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"wah wahhhhh. uhmmmmmm. have any of you ever eaten mexican food before? i mean, REAL Mexican food. not like some Garcia's or Macayo's chain-Mexican. i hear that the quality has gone down, but this place is far from authentic. it definitely caters to the gringos - which pack this place out!   came here for a dinner with my in-laws and a livingsocial coupon. the husband and FIL got the carne asada plate... it looked like they split a half serving of carne asada between the two of them. no joke. my MIL got a shredded beef chimi, which was huge and stuffed with meat, but she wasn't impressed. i had the chicken taco salad. which was mostly chicken, unripened avocados, and sour cream. BARELY any lettuce. it was so standard.  the chips were tasty, i'll give them that. but i was also starving during the long wait. the salsa? shmeh. yeah, sure, the decor is kitschy, but who cares if the food sucks?  it's pricey, typical, and not authentic. yup - will NOT be making any sort of effort to eat here again. EVER. for crying out loud, we live in ARIZONA! it's practically Mexico here. there are a meeeeellion different Mexican food joints that are better. perhaps not cleaner, perhaps they mostly habla espanol... but they are a heck of a lot cheaper and tastier than this overrated joint."}
{"text":"One of our all-time favorite Mexican food restaurants in the area. We LOVE their fresh chips and salsa. Beans and rice are good and traditional. Tacos, tostadas, & the veggie burrito are some of my other favorites. Also, can't go wrong with Barq's Red Cream soda or fresh watermelon juice!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love. This place was great. The soft tacos I had were overflowing with chicken; the rice and beans were delicious. I would eat here daily if I could!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight after getting a haircut at Prime Cut & Sew.  Always busy, but the food and excellent service are well worth the wait. I had the stuffed chicken enchiladas with two over-easy eggs on top (by request) and my wife had the shrimp enchiladas.  The food was fantastic as usual, we dined outside on the patio.  We love this place!!"}
{"text":"It was just a-ok. It didn't make me want to come back and eat there again. I had a chicken chimichanga and felt that Rosa's was better. When I am in the studio at the Mesa Arts Center, I'd run to here if Sweet Cakes was closed.  Mango's isn't my first choice. It usually ranks towards the bottom...mostly because I find the food a bit on the blah side.  Sorry, Mango's lovers...this one's a bit of a bust for me. Three stars because it could be much much worse."}
{"text":"Ordered the killer burrito, and 6 hrs later, I'm still full. Wowzers! The menu is pretty basic, no frills and no free chips and salsa (which is ok, because I would have exploded had I eaten more food). My friend and I sat outside because it was a beautiful day for it, but inside looked appealing also. Very quaint. I totally recommend giving it a try. Yum"}
{"text":"I enjoyed in immensely with only a few slight draw backs. The location is wonderful. I am not a desert fan, but there is something nice about eating outside on a warm day when it's January 4th. I had the chimichanga which was delicious. I chose the chicken which had a wonderful fresh flavor and a nice spice. My girlfriend had a burrito, which neither of us enjoyed as much because the flour tortilla tasted a little flat and she didn't enjoy the spice of the chicken. The chips where great, with a flour/corn mix flavor. I thought the salsa was good but bland. It tasted fresh, but lacked bite. I spiced it up and it was much better. The rice was some of the best I have had, and the beans were very good. I have had refried beans on a couple of different occasions in Phoenix and often there is a real smokey flavor. I love it, but it takes some getting used to. All and all I would recommend this place for a reasonable and good meal."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Small restaurant with some indoor and outdoor seating. Walk up order style."}
{"text":"Stopped in here before attending a show at the nearby Mesa Arts center.  It was delicious.  I got the taco salad and my friend ordered the pork torta.   Delicious!  The chips are homemade and the salsa as well.  Not expensive and great food!"}
{"text":"This place is always busy! I wanted to try it out. I got the two shrimp tacos combo and my boyfriend got the beef enchiladas and a fish taco.  Pros: beans and rice were great, the enchilada sauce was delicious as well. Service was quick. The salsa was pretty good (small heat to it)  Cons: shrimp tacos were very very bland, they were spicy but didn't have any other flavor in my opinion. The fish taco was dry. And the beef enchiladas weren't anything special.   All in all it was just meh. Not going to be racing to go back."}
{"text":"Mangos has a few things that make it as good as it gets! For starters, the food is phenomenal! It doesn't matter what you want, it will have flavor and incredible taste! Not just that, every time I come the waiter is attentive and genuine. During the cooler seasons they have fresh tamales available - first come first serve.   Heads up it's cash only - but worth a trip to the ATM if need be."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident and it was packed inside so we figured we should try it. So good! We had shredded beef tacos with rice and beans, cheese quesadillas, and chips and salsa. Best Mexican food we've had in a long time. There's outside seating too, which was nice because we have two little ones who enjoyed people watching. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, I love their $2 taco special happy hour!!!!!!!!!! And their fish tacos are awesome, but I get the spicy stuff on the side, it's a little pungent. The chips and dip are oddly addicting, and worth going in themselves. It's a place to go with a good friend, it's not very large, but it's very colorful inside, and the waiters are nice."}
{"text":"Overpriced food, slow service, flavors were either just spicery or non existent. Decor was cute. We will not be returning. Carne asada was gamey, tamale was dry, torta was all bread, tilapia was greasy."}
{"text":"The place is ok. I'm a Mexican coming from El Paso and was in the area for business purpose. It is close to the taste of real Mexican food. We had the steak fajitas and stuffed enchiladas. The fajitas had too much bell peppers and onions but that's about the same in every Mexican restaurant here in the US. The stuffed enchiladas taste more like burritos as they have too much shredded beef but they are good. Rice and beans taste like home made."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying, Mangos. We were highly impressed, not only was the food delicious but the service was awesome too. We'll be going back, for sure!"}
{"text":"This is supposed to be the better of the two Mexican dining options in downtown Mesa.  The Chile Verde was good but portions were small and the carne asada plate was some of the worst excuse for food I have ever encountered!  It was thin, dry, tough and had zero (0) flavor!  Made one taco after sawing through it only to toss the rest of it in a garbage can.  Maybe we should try the other place to see if it can be any worse!  Would have given one (1) star but the chile verde is good and they have fresh fruit drinks.  The Carne Asade plate was a \"special\" on the chalkboard!  Not very special at all, a complete waste of $10.00...yikes!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not from the area but I swung in while in town. The Carne Asada was dismal at best, the \"steak\" was the thinnest piece of over done shoe leather I've ever seen. Service was fast and friendly but man the one plate I had wasn't worth the $10+"}
{"text":"The green chile burrito was different from what I've had in the past. They use oregano vs cumin to flavor the meat. I can't say I'm in favor of it."}
{"text":"I tried this place after having several people recommend it.  It was ok, not great but not bad either.  It was very busy when I went which is always a good sign, but it just didn't live up to the hype for me.  Still I may return if I am hungry for Mexican food and am in the area."}
{"text":"Now THIS is real Mexican food!   The food is simple, DELICIOUS & very reasonably priced.   You have to place your order at the counter & then they normally bring it to your table for you. I always get an Horchata to sip on while I wait :)   One of my favorite entrees there is the Carne Asada Torta,,,,,, yum! But I have yet to try anything there that I wasn't happy with. And don't skip desert, forget the never ending diet & indulge in some fresh home made flan :) You won't be sorry!   The staff are friendly & make you feel at home :)  The location is small (tables inside & a few outside), bright, lively & inviting. They are located near a gallery that you can saunter through until you're able to button your pants back again, lol   It gets full at midday, so it's best if you go before or after the lunch rush. Parking is a bit difficult to find, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Tortillas, salsa, service, prices, it was a wonderful stop! Order at the counter service sit down after. No alcohol/beer just FYI. The adobada was terrific!"}
{"text":"We thought that this was a solid gringo Mexican restaurant with decent salsa and chips, beans, and rice. The prices were OK and the staff was friendly.  I came on a Saturday afternoon, and it was very busy with a long wait to order at the counter. Once you order it's seat yourself and there's indoor and outdoor seating. The food came pretty quickly.  I had fish tacos, which I'm not a huge fan of in general so maybe not the best judge, but they were good. There was a lot of citrus and everything was very fresh."}
{"text":"Probably the first Mexican restaurant I ate at upon moving to the East Valley. I'm a bit of a connoisseur now since I've eaten at a hundred other joints since then. Great carne asada. Probably in the Top Ten. Burros are fab and their chips and salsa are way yummy.   The place is kind of small and can get crowed when there's an event at the Mesa Arts Center seeing how Subway and Jack in the Crack seem to be the only other real choices in swanky downtown Mesa. But they do have a nice little patio out front. Prices are reasonable and portion sizes are too!"}
{"text":"Today I came in for my 2nd time and it was great. They  have a shrimp burrito and taco combo with rice and beans and it is delicious. There is fresh Pico and green Chile inside the burrito. It also comes with fresh avocado and there delicious salsa. I love how fresh their food is and how great it tastes. One of my favorite mexican food spots here in AZ! My wife and I will be back for some more!"}
{"text":"first time here and it was amazing! great enchiladas and some of the best chips and salsa that I've tasted. food came out in a fast manner! People were nice, I live in Scottsdale but I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food! Very hard working & friendly staff. Always on my list for a good lunch stop it Mesa."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly staff. They serve complementary chips and salsa and they're salsa is about as good as it gets. Today I had a shrimp burrito which included avocado in what seemed to be a home made tortilla. The indoor seating is colorful and the outdoor seating is along a south facing walkway - perfect for that winter sun."}
{"text":"Mangos Mexican Cafe is a great little place in downtown Mesa, west of Milano's Music. The interior is cute, but is showing wear. There was obviously a leak in the ceiling, and is destroying the mache sun in the ceiling center. You order from the counter, then they bring your meal to your choice of table. Breakfast is great, as are the other meals. Everything is fresh and hot, with perfect flavor. The heuvos rancheros are ine of my favorites. The salsa is good - with an almost chipotle flavor. The chips are bottomless, though not warm. Service is good. You seldom run dry on your beverage or chips. I recommend that you get an agua fresca while you are there...fresh fruit watera/juices. My personal favorite is the sandia (watermelon). If you want good Mexican food in a quaint, quiet setting, give Mango's a try."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Had a great torta. The chips and salsa were delicious. Good service and friendly people. Definitely worth a stop in!"}
{"text":"The BEST Mexican food in Mesa EVER! Must order the Mangos taco salad with the BEST EVER Al Pastor marinated tender Pork. Husband had the taco and enchilada plate with lots of beans and rice. Flavorful and you won't leave hungry! Try it, you'll LOVE? it, too!"}
{"text":"Mango's cafe for lunch on a beautiful Saturday in sunny Mesa! The staff greeted us promptly, guided me through the menu and we placed our order. We were given a number and we sat outside. Chips and salsa was presented to us with our drinks. The server was friendly and hooked us up with extra spicy salsa and some peppers. Our lunch was brought out in a very timely fashion.  The cheese enchilada and beef taco combo with beans/rice was really good. Not too greasy and textures were very fresh!! Portions were good, not enough to make you feel uncomfortable. Overall the experience was pleasant and we will be back! Note the parking in the back is the best place to park."}
{"text":"Best all you can grub chips and salsa in Mesa! Great menu choices, fresh, friendly staff, and great orchata! They switched to cash only though a few months back so heads up!"}
{"text":"Just flat out yummy. My husband ordered marinated pork chimicanga and it was packed with flavor with some sweetness and spicy. Pineapples in there. I had a steak burrito that was super yummy too, although his was more flavorful. Service was good, tables were clean. Will be going back again when in Mesa again!"}
{"text":"Food: 3.5 Service: 3 Ambience: 3 Price: 3  I agree with some of the other reviews that if this place were not a Mesa institution, it probably would not be rated so well.   It is a walk up order, so I can't say much about the service. I ordered the grilled tilapia tacos for $8.99. They brought us out chips and salsa but they were really not good. The chips are super thick, which I wouldn't have minded so much if they weren't also cold and stale. The least they could do is keep them under a heat lamp. The salsa was okay, but had zero heat. Our food came out pretty quickly.  The tacos were pretty bad. The tilapia was flavorless, overcooked, and clearly not grilled. They were topped only with some flavorless sauce, cilantro, and raw onion. This would be the acceptable amount of toppings for a fish taco if the fish was standout, which it was not in this case. The tortillas were the only redeeming part of the dish, but overall there is no way I'd order that again.  The reason why this place doesn't get 2 stars is because of the rice and beans. I've had a lot rice and beans in my life and Mango's is hands down the best. I will be coming back just for them.   The service was alright. They only came to refill our waters once and we were the only people in the restaurant.   If you like rice and beans, come! But if you want all around good Mexican food, there are better places to go in Mesa."}
{"text":"I love Mangos. In my opinion one of the best mexican restaurants in the valley. Best salsa I have ever had! One problem is they prefer cash, I would visit more often if they took cards."}
{"text":"This place has the best Mexican in town! The food isn't super greasy and the meat isn't fatty. The shrimp tacos are my favorite. I recommend it to everyone I know."}
{"text":"More of a gourmet Mexican place than traditional. I'd rather eat traditional. Staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in a while! We got the chimichanga and the shredded beef was so flavorful and tender the shell was crispy and the rice was amazing! The chips were freshly made and the salsa had the perfect flavor. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Chips and Salsa are pretty darn good. I would say this was the best part of the meal for me.  Got the Chimichanga. Pretty darn good. It has pico even though the menu doesn't say so. If you don't like pico, you better ask. It is a very tomato heavy pico too.  Place is on the Main Street drag of Downtown Mesa and has quite nice feel to it with plenty of seating since they have outside seating as well.  They were out of Churros when I happened to be there. Bummer.  Service was fine. Not great, but good enough. Overall a good place to stop if you find yourself in the area, though I wouldn't drive a long way to go here specifically."}
{"text":"In the last 6 months or so they added grilled Talapia  tacos...YUMMMMM. Nice people work there, good service. Been going there for 20 yrs... or whenever they opened"}
{"text":"Mangos has quickly become my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley. The only issue (which in no way detracts from the 5-star rating) is how small it is. During peak busy times, you're lucky if you can find a seat. But that's ok, it's a small restaurant and I want it to stay that way. They seriously have the best red sauce I've ever tasted. I always get the 2 enchilada combo or the 1 enchilada 1 taco combo. Every time they bring out the food, I think there's no way it's gonna fill me up, but every time I walk out full and satisfied, without being over full. We tried their new Bean Dip appetizer with the complimentary chips and salsa (best non-greasy chips ever) and we loved it. Perfect compliment to our meal. I always get the same thing but my wife tries something different each time and she's yet to be disappointed. I just love this place and the only reason we don't come more often is it's in Downtown Mesa and you have to mess with parking. But again, that in no way detracts from he 5-star rating."}
{"text":"This is some of the more overrated, Americanized Mexican I have had in the valley. Not sure why this place is so highly praised when there is so much amazing Mexican in the area. See Blue Adobe (just down the street, Gallo Blanco, Los Dos Molinos, La Condesa, Carolina's... All unique, flavorful, interesting and way more authentic. The food here is not terrible but in an area rich with Incredible Mexican this place is in no way worth the hype or the wait"}
{"text":"3.5/5  After chatting with one of the lovely ladies that works at the Salon de Beaute across the street, she told me that she loved going to Mango's for lunch and they had great food. She said she is picky about her Mexican food since she is from Mexico and a lot of her family lives south of the border so I had to check it out!  This little Mexican restaurant has great ambiance, with its cute decorations and lively, brightly colored walls. The menu has all your standard favorites such as tacos, enchiladas, and burros to name a few. I like how they offer chile rellenos with different meat fillings, not just cheese. They have freshly made aguas frescas off to the side and Coke products with diet Dr. Pepper as well as diet Coke. Note that the horchata is one of those premixed drinks that come from a separate soda fountain.  I had the al pastor burro ($5.50) to go. It only took a few short minutes and was packaged in a small brown paper bag with an enormous serving of tortilla chips, 2 salsa cups, a lime wedge, and napkins. The whole bag was nearly bursting at the seams and it was hard to carry it without tearing the bag unless I was holding it from the bottom but I don't mind, I'm definitely not going to complain about people giving me too much food! :)  The burro was pretty basic, just meat and tortilla. The meat had good flavor, having a salty, rich taste with some bits of pineapple. The chips were decent, and the salsa went well with both the chips and burro.   Service was friendly and the festive decor makes you feel a little like you're in a tropical cafe instead of the dry desert.   I'll be back to try more on their menu. The lovely beauty expert I talked to said she loved their enchiladas and tortas so I will try that next!"}
{"text":"Just started eating Mexican food again after a very long time.  It seemed it all tasted the same.  Mango's changed my mind.  Food was great, place was crowded but now we know why, the food is great.  Tacos, rice and beans, will certainly be stopping by again in the near future."}
{"text":"If I had to choose my favorite Mexican food in AZ I would pick Mangos. Hands down. I've not had anything here that I didn't love. Even their chips & salsa are amazing!!!! But my favorite is their vegetarian burrito. No other veg. Burrito can touch this one!!! It's really to die for. Their chicken taco salad is pretty great too! It's a small place & can get crowded, but I love the downtown Mesa atmosphere! Check their hours before going-- they are a little funny & can fluctuate depending on the time of year!"}
{"text":"I love mangoes, service is always good, the homemade juices are so delicious! Atmosphere is great. The only complaints I have is that they close a little early and the prices are a little high. Other than that the food is tasty and I will be going back."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago while visiting the Mesa area for business.  I was really hopeful that it would be the best, but it was just OK.  I got a Chicken Chimichanga with rice/beans and like I said, it was just OK.  The limeade was great, but the food left me looking for more.  We did get to sit outside in the 65 degree weather which was a nice change for me from 25 degree Utah at the time.  That was the best part for me."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here often. The chips and salsa are our favorite. We always enjoy our food and though it is a seat yourself, the staff is always prompt and helpful."}
{"text":"The best. We have been coming to Mangos for years. The salsa is addicting and the chips are made fresh. My husband always gets the carne Asada burrito enchilada style and it is soooo good. I normally get a torta (a sandwich on a bolillo roll with mustard, grilled chicken or carne asada, avocado, tomato, onion, etc) or chicken soft tacos. Always walk out fat and happy! Staff is super nice and service is great."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Mango's by a coworker when I was employed by a company based in downtown Mesa. After quickly tiring of all the typical stuff in the area, I was excited to try something new and he mentioned that they had great salsa and $0.99 chicken tacos from 2-4. That was all that needed to be said, as those are two of my favorite things when it comes to Mexican food. Unfortunately, they no longer do the $0.99 chicken taco special (damn you, economy! This is the only reason I can't give it a 5 star rating, it's a little pricey for what you get) but I still make it a point to stop by from time to time and grub here. The salsa is indeed quite good, and the chicken tacos (while a little on the greasy side) are worth the trip."}
{"text":"not impressed.  the food was only so-so.  i can see where people might be drawn to the old town atmosphere, which was pleasant, but i can get better food at filabertos."}
{"text":"I used to have this sort \"ugh, mexican food for snowbird tourists\" attitude towards Mango's. I live and work right in downtown Mesa, and have eaten there maybe twice over the last 9 years... it wasn't until recently that suddenly the joy and amazingness of Mango's really showed itself to me. The environment is almost tropical, and very pleasant.. lots of color, and vibe. Great music. The food is pretty great. Their pollo asado is just killer, and they certainly serve one of the most hearty, tasty quesadillas I've ever experienced. Their chimichangas, and just about everything else are also fantastic. I'm looking at lovely Mango's outside of my office window as I type this, and I'm tempted to run over and stuff my face with like.. 20 dollars worth of food, but I don't want to rupture my gut on Christmas Eve. It's a true institution in Mesa, an area that truly deserves more love than the rest of the valley gives it. Come on down, and check it out!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. They put a lot of time and care in their food. They make chips and salsa fresh and have great guacamole!"}
{"text":"This has got to be the best Mexican restaurant in Mesa. I've been to many of the Mexican restaurants in the Mesa area and nothing even comes close to Mango's. Inside it's very colorful and fun. The wait staff is quick, kind, and very funny. They serve all of the recognizable Mexican dishes: nachos, enchiladas and a ton of different types of burritos. They also serve a variety of fruity drinks and horchata. While this might sound boring and predictable, the food is absolutely mind-blowing. They may not have a ton of menu options, what they do have is done exceptionally well. The prices are also surprisingly reasonable. I had the cheese enchiladas and the biggest lemonade I've ever seen.  My food came quickly, about ten minutes after I had ordered. The enchiladas were smothered in red sauce and cheese, they looked amazing. The inside was full of melting queso fresco. The homemade lemonade was ice cold and not too sweet. I ate slowly, savoring each bite of cheesy deliciousness.  My overall experience at Mango's was unbeatable. The restaurant is well-located, close to a lot of different downtown shops and entertainment. This is the place to go if you love Mexican food and are looking for a fun place to have lunch or dinner. I'll definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"This place is crowded at lunch.. They offer inside and patio seating in the heart of Downtown Mesa..  It's always a good sign when there's a big lunch crowd. Totally worth the wait.. They are used to it so the line moves quick.   Tilapia tacos were the lunch special on my first trip .. Cooked perfectly, with rice and beans.. Salsa and chips are brought to the table with your drink order.  Mangos salad was a good size with lots of avocado and pollo asado (chicken on the grill)..   Check out the lunch specials or the seafood options, I'm sure you won't be disappointed   Park in back of the building, find the jewelry store walkway.. Shorter then going all the way around."}
{"text":"My husband's chicken taco just roared with flavor. My vegetable burrito was fresh and delicious. The chips and salsa were some of the best we've ever had. The service was perfect. We will be back."}
{"text":"Small cafe, but great food!!!  No cocktails here, but Desert Eagle Brewery is on the same block. Cheers and enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Mesa for a convention.  We wanted to eat close to our hotel which was on Main Street. Thanks to fellow yelpers we chose Mangos.  We both had the special which was steak fajitas.  Our food was served hot and quickly after we ordered.  The customer service was outstanding.  We will go back again before we leave town."}
{"text":"I bet you suburbanites of \"America's most boring city\" love paying top dollar to get just decent Mexican food. When it comes to my search for great Mexican food, I just can't catch a break outside of the barrio.   I ordered the Killer Burrito. Beef, beans, guac, and sour cream. Possibly a bit of cheese. The tortillas are made fresh from scratch, and taste amazing. Their beef tastes exactly like it would from someone's home. The salsa was nothing to get excited over, but the fresh, hot chips were great.  So you're probably wondering why I gave this two stars?  The prices are a joke! If you don't believe me, laugh at this:   Any plain burrito (carne asada, chicken, etc.) is $6, but if you don't like yours plain, it'll cost ya.  The horchata costs $2.75, and it's the fountain drink horchata, NOT the real stuff.  A quesadilla with carne asada, sour cream, and guac comes out to $11.00. Yeah, I made that face, too.  My burrito was $7.50.   No, portions are NOT huge, they're the same as every other place. So in reality you're paying up to *double* the price for your meal (just think of that quesadilla!), and you're certainly not getting the quality to match. But does Mesa really have an alternative?"}
{"text":"The food is great. Prices are good,. But daytime entertainment? As if it wasn't loud enough in here already.. I have a headache. Sorry Mangos."}
{"text":"It's been years since I've tried this place, only been a couple of times.  But what I have tasted in the past has been great!  Their refried beans are pretty good, they taste homemade and the flavor is pretty good.  Salsa is GREAT!  Chips seem light and fluffy.    And they used to have a .99 cent Taco day for a few hours on a Monday or Tuesday that was an amazing deal.  Don't know if they still have that but their Taco's are pretty good in taste.  Only downfall I find is that they are pretty skimpy in filling them with ingredients and low on the meat.  Would like to try their Chile Relleno.  Don't know if it's good or not."}
{"text":"Best chips and salsa I have had in a long time! Super cute decor. I had the shredded chicken burrito and it was packed with yummy yummy chicken. We also ordered a cantaloupe drink that was very refreshing. Service was very efficient and good. We had no problems with our meal. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have a new favorite place when I am in town visiting Benedictine U. Chips and salsa are the best I've had and everything is super fresh and delicious. Wifi would be nice."}
{"text":"There are a couple of Mexican places within a block or two on Main Street. The other is mediocre and usually crowded. Mango's, on the other hand, is not mediocre (it is very good) although it, too, can be crowded, particularly at lunchtime.  I have eaten here twice in as many days, and been pleased both times. I had the Tilapia Taco platter two days ago, and the Shrimp Taco platter today. Both meals were lunch, as I was busy at a nearby conference, with limited time to grab a bite mid day.  The Tilapia Taco were good, but the fish was what you have come to expect. A little earthy. I'm not a Tilapia fan, in general, so this was a bit of a risk. I can't blame Mango's...  The Shrimp Tacos, on the other hand, were great, with grilled shrimp and nice salsa fresca. I'm a big fan of these.  So don't hesitate to try Mango's if you haven't already. That many Yelpers can't be wrong!"}
{"text":"Always a good Mexican meal and reasonably priced!   I love the shredded beef tacos with their salsa, so yummy!"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, and great prices.  We came in on a busy Saturday and we had chips and salsa immediately and our great food came shortly after. My kids loved their meals and ate them all. The staff went above and beyond to make this an enjoyable place to eat. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We got food poisoning from coming here! The wait was long, the food average, and a night of praying to the porcelain god made this whole thing a terrible experience."}
{"text":"I really grow weary of people talking this place up as the place you would HAVE to bring outta-towners for good Mexican food in Arizona. The aguas frescas are really the best thing here. You have to have an early lunch though because they run out way too fast. For the life of me I will never understand why, if there is a high demand for one of your products, you wouldn't make more of it. In the past when I ate here, they would have about 3 5-gallon containers of 3 different flavors. This time they had one and I didn't bother to even ask what it was. It looked like a basic lemonade and there was about 2 gallons left at 1 pm, so it couldn't have been great. The aguas frescas are really the only reason that I would consider 3 stars on this place.   I've been 4-5 times over a period of about 10 years. Every time I go I leave disappointed. The beans are okay. The rice is dry. The meat is average. I've had chicken, carbon, and carne asada, and they all have been just fine. The restaurant is very small and crowded with a terrible layout. I realize that they have probably done the best they could with the space they have, but if there is any line at all people will be standing in line next to your table and orders will be coming from the kitchen and through the line to incessantly interrupt any conversations that you are trying to have.   The hype behind this place probably impacts the harshness of my critique as well. If I was in the area, too hungry to wait and drive somewhere else to eat, or out of gas, all while being in the mood for the semblance of Mexican food, then I might stop in for a bite. Otherwise, there is much better Mexican food to be had in Arizona."}
{"text":"Went here with my husband and son for lunch and we all really enjoyed our food. I really liked the salsa, good spice and flavor, but not too hot. I got the cheese chili relleno plate, and it was really good, full of cheese with an egg batter coating.  My husband loved his shredded chicken chimichanga.  The shredded chicken had a flavorful red sauce (I tried a bite) and the shell was crispy but tender.  My son had a carne asada burrito with pico de gallo and it was loaded with steak! He said the steak was delicious. Shortly after we left the place was crowded with people, around 12:45, so I'm glad we were there earlier."}
{"text":"This is one of our family's favorite Mexican restaurants! The food tastes authentic and delicious! My favorite is their crunchy shredded beef tacos!  The owners are always friendly and welcoming! You can't beat their fresh homemade chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"If you offer me black beans vs. retried pinto that's a winner for me.  Three handmade tortillas wrapped in seasoned chicken taste like taquitos only lighter and tastier. The aqua frescas was good also. Pretty much everything they brought out looked fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Disgusting! Just found a spider in my quesadilla, I called and complained and was treated like i was lying. I was told to bring the food back because the cook stated that it couldnt be possible. my goal was to take it back no matter what a get a refund! Not very professional to tell the consumer they are lying!"}
{"text":"Great service, friendly faces, big smiles, tip bowl is a fish, salt and pepper available even though nobody uses that at mexican food restaurants, nice decor, good chips, too spicy (cried), good ice, nice treasure chest, signing off now, -KJP^2"}
{"text":"1st..downtown Mesa needs to get its props. They have some really good places to check out and Mango's is one of them.  Mangos is one of my favorite Mexican food stops. I love their taco salads because their tacos are homemade and soooo delish.   I also love their 100% fruit juices, so simple and so good. You gotta get there before the lunch crowd if you want some though, they run out super fast.   Simple, Delish, and fun.  Oh....and here's a lil inside hint, going to the bathroom there is an adventure on its own...."}
{"text":"Torta was aweome and my wife loved her chicken enchilada. Getting my wife to try anything other than taco bell is a major feat, and the fact hat she made a point to say she liked it speaks volumes. We will be goin back."}
{"text":"Food was great, but the wait staff left much to be desired.  The man at the register (long-time employee, been here for years) was very unfriendly, even seemed bothered to have to take our order.  I'd rather visit a restaurant where the food isn't as great than feel as though I'm unwanted.  Won't be back for a long time!"}
{"text":"The food is great!  One of my favorite Mexican restaurants.  I've been going there since it opened.  That being said with the exception of one newer waiter, the staff is rather unwelcoming and unfriendly. If the food were not so good I'd never go back.  If you don't mind bad treatment the food is great!"}
{"text":"I have had lunch here twice. The staff was courteous and food arrived in good time. First time there I had the steak fajitas. The fajita platter portion was good but the steak was a little tough but tasty. The second time I was there, I was so hungry, I would have gladly eaten the anus out of a dead platypus. This time I ordered the beef chimichanga. The shredded beef was tender but somewhat bland. All in all a pretty decent place to eat but I thought the prices a bit on the high side."}
{"text":"Mango's is a fixture in downtown Mesa. Everyone in the area knows and loves this place. It has a casual cafe feel, and the food is tremendous.  I am not a vegetarian, but the veterinarian burrito (enchilada style) almost converted me. The chips and salsa are wonderful. The service is excellent. They also carry specialty Mexican juices and sodas.  I would strongly suggest you try this place for Lunch the next time you're in the downtown Mesa area."}
{"text":"Found mangoes while at the first Friday of the month bike night in downtown Mason just by chance we tried their food boy am I glad we did it we will be back"}
{"text":"I just moved into town and was looking for a place to eat. I hit the jackpot when I found this colorful little place. The shrimp burrito was amazing and the staff was treated me like family, welcoming me to the neighborhood!!! This will be my go to spot for good authentic Baja style Mexican food!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the green chili burrito with green sauce and it was good but I wouldn't consider it great.  There was too much fat in the meat.  I prefer leaner pork.  The enchiladas were really good and they do provide complimentary chips and salsa.  The salsa was really good and fresh. I have had the taco's in the past and I think that is what I will stick to ordering in the future as they were exceptional.  I would also consider ordering the enchiladas again as well."}
{"text":"All of the reviews posted speak of their taco's, burrito's, chimi's and chips. I also love these mexican dishes but have you tried their Brakfast Burrito?  They offer two kinds and are worth going in for.  They stop serving them at 1pm so plan ahead.  We love everyone at Mango's and are considered \"Local Regulars\" and even though they may see us frequently they treat every customer with honesty and care.  I have never known them to mess up an order and all employee's work hard regardless if it is in their own job or covering for another employee.  We love Mango's Mexican Cafe!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Paul gave us detailed suggestions and they were spot on for what we were looking for!"}
{"text":"Have driven by this place a few times and decided to stop in today. A nice little cafe with indoor and patio seating. Ordered the shredded chicken enchiladas and they were absolutely delicious!! All the staff are very nice and accommodating. The prices are a little high but the portions are a decent size. Left pleasantly full and will definitely be back in the near future."}
{"text":"This place is really good. The salsa is an incredibly mild like most Mexican restaurants make it. We got the killer burrito, and a shrimp burrito, with a bottle of coke. Everything was wonderful. Service is good. Comes with chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Very satisfied. Great customer service very prompt. First time we at there last night at motorcycles on main. We will return. Food was awesome. Keep up good work. I will share with my organization and customers I move into the area. I am a household mover and share good enjoyable places to check out and this is one I diffenently will suggest and share with new valley residence"}
{"text":"Started my Taco Tuesday of 2018 here and was not disappointed with the Al Pastor Tacos, but can't really say that for the Tilapia Tacos. The Pork used for the pastor tacos were marinated just right and tender. However the tilapia tacos were a bit bland of flavor, but all you'll need to do is add some salsa and you'll be fine. The beans and rice were just right beans neither was dry and certainly the beans were not runny. The chips were a bit tough, but the salsa was great tonight. Whenever both are made in-house there will be irregularities time to time, it's nothing to hold against them."}
{"text":"I love Mango's tacos--the best in town. The service is friendly and, if you don't come during the lunch rush, very fast. You can get a good meal for a really reasonable price here. But one thing I really hate about Mango's is that they are randomly closed on days when they should be open. They were closed on Labor Day, for instance. Why? It's not like the rest of Mesa was dead just because the banks weren't open.   I tried to go there on Saturday, December 23, 2017. Yeah, it was the Saturday before Christmas, and people want to hang out with their families. But it's also a day when people don't want to cook. There was even an outdoor Christmas market at the next intersection. Downtown was pretty busy, with lots of foot traffic up and down Main Street. But Mango's was closed. WHY? If your business is to feed people, you should be open when they want to eat."}
{"text":"Local restaurant with blah Mexican food.  I have had some great food and this wasn't one of the places that served it.  Prices are okay and they only take cash."}
{"text":"Yay! this place is surprisingly good! :D With all the bad mexican food i've had since I moved to AZ I was really really happy to find this place. The chips and salsa were fresh and tasty. I ordered the Killer Burrito with pollo asado. So yummy! You could tell that all the ingredients were fresh; from the tortilla to the guac that rocks to the perfectly seasoned chicken (not too salty and not too bland). We also got a carne asada burrito enchilada style. The carne asada was also really tender and moist not dry and hard to swallow like some other places. The red sauce was also really really flavorful and good.   I asked the waiter for some hot sauce and he offered up tapatio which is decent. But then he surprised me with salsa with some habanero in it. oh man! I love spicy foods so that really hit the spot and also gave him some brownie points for going above and beyond.   The location of the place is also in a cool area of downtown Mesa. Nearby is a bit rundown but right along Main street is kind of a cool place to walk around with a guitar shop, piano shop, sweet cakes bakery, the monsterland bar and grill (which is on my list of to dos :D), etc.   Yummy food, great service, great experience!"}
{"text":"This place is great. When we are cravin' Mexican, this is our first choice. My hubby loves the carne asada burrito and I am a fan of the basic tacos. Good basic Mexican food, you can go wrong here.   And the chips and salsa... yes it's true, they are the best. I can make just a meal of them, and I sort of did when I had the nachos."}
{"text":"First time here  very good menu a little of everything. I had the #4 combo with a shredded chicken burrito with rice and beans. Yummy. :) very good flavor. It did not need salsa or anything. By the way the salsa was really good too. My friend had the mangos salad. It was loaded with avocado chicken lettuce tomato etc. nice size salad which she said was very good. Over all I would go again.  :)"}
{"text":"Was visiting Mesa and found Mango's on Yelp. Great reviews. Was happy we found it. I had the chili rellenos. Great. The food was very good but not a typical restaurant experience. You have to order at the counter then they bring you your drinks and amazing tortilla chips and salsa and we didn't see out waiter again. Went inside for our free refills.  Not really an issue, this place is casual but I waited 15 + minutes for the server after she sat us outside so we waited longer than we should.  That said, my mismatched expectations aside, very nice place with friendly staff and very good food"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in AZ, No Contest!!! Awesome staff, delicious food and the best salsa!!!!"}
{"text":"Mango's is by far the best Mexican food I've had in Arizona. I'm from LA so finding good Mexican food in Arizona that suits the style I'm used to has been pretty disappointing. For a metro area that has so many Mexican restaurants it's pretty pathetic that there is only one I really like. And that of course, is Mango's. The chips and salsa are so delicious! It's seriously the best salsa I've had in AZ. And it's FREE - included in your meal like chips and salsa should be! I hate going to places where I end up paying extra for chips and salsa and they give me some nasty red sauce with seeds in it. That shit is all over AZ, seriously what gives? Anyway, I am obsessed with shredded beef crispy tacos and this place has really good ones. I used to work in Mesa so it was close by for a lunch break but I no longer work there so I haven't been back in a couple months. I drove 20 minutes out of my way yesterday to get me a shredded beef taco from Mango's and I get there and they were freaking closed! Apparently they close at 4 on Monday's (and I believe 7 the rest of the week, closed Sunday). I was super bummed :( I ended up going a few blocks up to Rosa's and the taco was good but their salsa was very meh.  A short rebuttal to the negative reviews given: I would seriously question the reliability of reviews given by people who ordered quesadillas and burritos. To begin with, I think there is always something wrong with a person who goes to a Mexican restaurant and orders a quesadilla. Unless you're under 12, grow up and order some big boy food. Any asshole can make a quesadilla or a burrito. If you are going to review a Mexican restaurant I think it should be on the entrees that actually require some skill: enchiladas, tamales, tacos, etc. And in that regard, Mango's does an excellent job. It is a tad expensive for what you get, but I will gladly continue to pay a little extra for the on-point flavors.  Also, if anyone has any recommendations for great crispy shredded beef tacos closer to N. Tempe/S. Scottsdale I'm all ears!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Mangos for years. The best tacos ever! Don't usually eat hardshell but they are amazing!! Highly recommend this restaurant if you want great Mexican food."}
{"text":"Delicious food and super friendly staff. We enjoyed dinner here before a concert. They serve really big portions so be prepared to share or take some home with you. We will be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place, but it was so busy. And I was with my Pescatarian friend. Prices were not too bad.  The food was excellent. I got a shrimp burrito and a shrimp taco combo. One of them had a little spicy jalapeno chopped up in it, but not too bad.  I would recommend this to anyone.  We were hesitant to use the restroom, but it wasn't bad at all.    The place is small, cozy.  As mentioned, very busy.  We went on 2nd Friday (Mesa downtown monthly event)."}
{"text":"Closest thing to real mexican food you will get in mesa. Their street tacos are great and even though they are usually lines going out the door. they get the food out quick."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times over the years. To me, it's good food, but not great. It is very fresh with a lot of vegetables, which I appreciate, but I think I prefer more traditional Mexican food. The staff are very nice and the place has a good vibe.   Last time I went, we ordered food to-go and they accidentally gave me shrimp tacos. THEY WERE SO SPICY! So, watch out for those if you don't like heat."}
{"text":"Pro's: Great decor, grilled chicken in the great tasting chimichanga and free refills on soda. Con's a little loud, waiter talked to us from across the room and had to order and pay 1st at a counter. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"This place was suggested by my hair stylist across the street.  Best Mexican food that we have had since being in Arizona.  Had a combination shrimp burrito and shrimp tacos.  Pico was really hot but was very tasty.  My husband had shrimp quesadilla  and he loved it.  Yummy chips and salsa, though were not complimentary.  The manager or owner came to our table and talked to us about the specials and what people love to eat there.  Very friendly.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Again, thanks to the power of Yelp, I opted for this place instead of some chain restaurant down the road.  What a great discovery.  I finally found a great shrimp burrito!!!  It was amazing, and not packed with rice or beans like they do at other restaurants...which take the space of shrimp.  No, this had tons of shrimp, pico de gallo and some slices of avocado.  The shrimp was stirfried or grilled with some spices.  Delicious.  My son loved his quesadilla and mentioned the beans were yummy, and my husband loved his salad.  The service was quick and very pleasant.  The place was clean and has tables outside, which was nice since it was in the 70s yesterday.  My husband didn't stop raving about the chips, how thick and flavorful they were...I liked the texture but the flavor was blah.  But no worries, I'll keep coming back."}
