{"text":"The staff here is very friendly. Sometimes if we come during a busy time we get busy service but they are still nice even when other customers turn into assholes. Their chips and salsa is the *BEST* I have had of any mexican restaurant and I have been to many and tried more. Their hot sauce is genuinely hot, and their mild salsa is rich with flavor and the chips are light and crispy and not greasy. I love their chimichangas, nachos, taquitos, and chile relleno.  This is a nice place my wife and I continue to return to."}
{"text":"Stopped at Matta's for a business dinner. There were lots of choices but I went with the Spanish ribeye.  It was served with rice and beans and a large flour tortilla. Service was ok but the food was excellent. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"This place is located in the Riverview shopping center in Mesa.  Before we went there we had no idea this place existed!! Neither did anyone else cause this place looked like a ghost town with all the rentable spaces.  We didnt even know where to enter the restaurant.  When we got inside it was very simple for a mexican restaurant, your basic mexican decor.  We sat outside on the patio, which was nothing special.  They start everybody out with chips and salsa, some of the best i have had!!! I couldn't stop eating them!!! Nom, nom! I ordered the 2 item combo plate with a cheese enchilada and a chorizo taco. I was impressed with the taste of the beans and the rice.  The big thing for me when i go to a mexican restaurant is they never get the rice right, but here they did.  The chorizo taco is poorly presented with half sliced unmelted kraft single cheese sitting in the taco.  It looked unappetizing.  Shredded is the way to go!! I only ate one of the two they gave me.  I wont be back again.  The only time i will ever get close to this place is if I go to Toby Keith Bar.  They pretty much get the three stars cause of the chips and salsa, rice, and beans.  Other then that, its no bueno."}
{"text":"Ok so I have to re-review....recently came back with my parents to eat and LOVED the food and had a great server! Green corn tamales were awesome and I love the salsa! Will be back soon for those two items for sure...oh and gotta love the Roberts taco yumm"}
{"text":"Awesome chili relenos and chicken fajitas. Our server Andrew was so nice. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 7 visiting from Los Angeles, Nevada and Arizona. Dominic was our waiter and the service was excellent. He was very funny, courteous and attentive and made the visit a highlight of our trip. We had chimichangas, fish tacos chorizo and eggs, a taco-tostada-enchilada combo and the Spanish Rib Eye steak. Every dish was tasty and plentiful - you won't leave hungry. The most memorable part was the homemade tortilla chips and homemade salsas - 5 to choose from. It was so good we bought a few jars to take home with us.   Thanks for a great time and memorable experience. Well definitely be back next year. Go Dodgers!"}
{"text":"After eating at Matta's once, I felt that the ambiance and service were good, but the food was only ok. And vegetarians should avoid Matta's unless it's for the bar.   My vegetarian friend was with me and when we asked the host if he knew if the beans were vegetarian he seemed confused, then disappeared into the back for a few minutes. When he came back, he told us that everything was cooked with lard except the rice and a meat dish...so not a good place to go with a vegetarian.   On the positive side, we both thought margaritas were good. So go for the ambiance and drinks."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to matta's for years and recently tried this new location. Just as always they were excellent we enjoyed our meal and our service was great. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Not real authentic Mexican food. The microwave use is obvious. The place has the venue but the customer service needs improvement, I arrived on a day where it was pretty empty but it took 15 minutes waiting at the front desk to be greeted. The food is wheeled out on medical carts. In the words of chef Ramsey: WHERE'S THE STANDARD!?"}
{"text":"Sadly I have to come here with family that loves the food. It's pretty eh. Last visit provided us with a dusty booth, a menu with old crusty salsa in it and a glass so filthy it had two old full lipstick marks on the rim. The fountain is covered in black fungus. Ew. Clean dining...not so much."}
{"text":"Avg Mexican food at an above avg price.  Too many good spots in the Valley to waste your money here."}
{"text":"Very friendly place, and you cant beet the food and drink prices."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Matta's since birth.  The food has always been great. The hot sauce is great.  The service can be hit or miss.  Seems to be a lot of turnover lately. Now for the food! Do yourself a favor and explore a bit. Bi have seen some reviews about queso dip and samer platters.  This is not tex-mex.  It is Sonoran Mexican. The Alibondiga soup is the best I have ever had.  The chile reyenos are incredible. The ground beef tacos are not a favorite of mine but I don't really like ground beef tacos anyway.  The Roberts tacos are great and I highly recommend them. The food is pretty consistent, I think the service is better in the bar and you can always get seated."}
{"text":"I've been sitting here for quite some time now. I've eaten a meal of chips and salsa. I've had two drinks. Some of us have had three. Still no food. It is not busy. I really don't understand what is taking so long. We don't have steaks. While I've had a full drink the entire time I still have no food and am ready to leave. I still not return. I'd hate to dine here on a busy night"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try, but I'm so glad I did!  It has been at Mesa Riverview for quite some time now.  The two salsas that come with chips are unique and they are both true to the \"mild\" and \"hot\" taste options.  If you want to get a taste of some amazing sauce, I HIGHLY recommend the Red Chile Platter or anything with the Machaca Green Chile.  Generous portions and big enough to share.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Service: excellent Beer selection:  not bad Food:  guacamole great, burro ok Ambiance:  good Salsa:  spicy"}
{"text":"Meh. High prices and food isn't delicious. Your local Filibertos is way better and less expensive ."}
{"text":"We had a terrible experience here - and on Valentine's Day! I don't know what was worse, the food or the service. Or the drinks. Weak tasteless, margs. Bland queso that seemed straight from the Velveeta package. And service was so slow, even though the place was not crowded. The only good part was the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Ideally I would have liked to give Matta's 2.5 stars, but since I can only rate in whole numbers, I rounded up, in part because they had only been open 3 days and I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt.   Now, I didn't grow up going to Matta's, but I did go to the old location once back in my college days at ASU, but I really have no memory of that experience. I know there are many devout Matta's fans out there, but I wasn't one of them and I my experience has not turned me into one.   The space is nice, but I feel that they are trying to give the place a more upscale feel, rather than a traditional family run Mexican restaurant. We arrived at about 5:30 on Saturday and were seated right away in the lounge, in fact we were the only table. We looked over the menu, and not being familiar with the Matta's menu, it took us awhile. Our waitress came by and we had a few questions as there weren't descriptions of some of the items, but she didn't know the answers and had to go ask. I know this is only day 3, but didn't they have employee training?   We finally settled on our order and then she brought us out some chips and salsa. The chips were warm and crispy and there were two different salsas, a smooth one and a chunky one. Let's just say, neither my sister nor I enjoyed either of them, they tasted exactly live V-8 juice mixed with canned tomatoes! YUCK! I tried to taste them a few more times to like them, but the canned tomato taste was just overwhelming....salsa should be fresh, not from a can!   Our food took over 20 minutes to come out from the kitchen for a simple chimichanga and a shrimp enchilada. My sister and I always order just beans, no rice because we both love beans, and well, we didn't love these beans at all. They had absolutely no bean flavor, they were so blah that I had to sprinkle them with salt just to get them down! The shrimp enchilada was nothing special, and I am not sure it was worth the $1.99 up-charge. The shredded beef chimichanga was pretty good, but we both felt that it was on the small size considering its $12.50 price tag.   Both of us went into the meal with high expectations, excited to have a new Mexican restaurant right by my sister's house, but by the end of the meal, we both decided that we would probably never return. Such a shame; Matta's may have lots of local history, but there is far better Mexican food to be had around town."}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I came in and it has awesome decor. The staff was very friendly. The chips were fresh but the salsa and bean dip was pretty bland. The food came out real quick and was steaming hot. My girlfriend had a burrito and I had the fajitas. We both felt the food was pretty bland. The food is definefly not the best to go if you want mexican but the ambiance made up for.it. the price was a bit steep but all in all it was a pleasant expierence."}
{"text":"Amazing and yummy. The chips were fresh and the salsa was yummy. Had the sampler combo. YUM."}
{"text":"I've been going to Matta's for as long as I can remember for birthdays, baptisms, funerals and for everyday meals as well.  Their ground beef enchiladas are my favorite and I usually get a side of French fries to dip in the enchilada sauce.  Their ground beef tacos, chile rellenos, and chips and salsa are yum too.  This place is a family tradition and I wish it was closer to work/home so I could enjoy it more often."}
{"text":"We have eaten dinner and lunch here on numerous occasions. The food is top notch and very fresh. Services ith (Melina) has always been flawless - ask for her, she is a gem of a lady!"}
{"text":"Darn, I really wanted to like this place.  We see movies at Cinemark often, and it would be great to find a 'go-to' Mexican restaurant nearby.  First, I will say that we only tried a few things, so this review cannot be considered comprehensive.  That said, the service was painfully slow and the food mediocre.  We paid $2 for about a tablespoon of guacamole.  The Mexican pizza was alright- a good amount of toppings but the whole thing was much smaller than we expected- compared to the same dish at other restaurants, this looked like something off the children's menu.  And, the queso...  I would not have bothered to write a bad review if it had not been for the queso dip.  The pizza and guac were not a good deal, but they tasted OK.  The queso dip was obviously out of a jar, bland, and served lukewarm.  Very disappointing.  At least I can say that the chips were good- fresh and not overly salted.  Perhaps the other entrees here are good, perhaps not.  I doubt that we will bother to find out."}
{"text":"I've never tried this place before and my mom and I were feeling adventurous. It's a cute little restaurant but the staff is not so welcoming. The hostess did greet us right away but when we sat down I noticed some crumbs on the table. I asked if someone could come and wipe the table down and the hostess said yes. Instead of a wet cloth (like other places would do) the hostess came back with a napkin and just dusted the table off. Trying to keep and open mind I let that go. The waitress finally came but wasn't as welcoming to us. She was familiar with some other guests and said a friendly goodbye with a hug. She gave us our menus and left. She came back and asked if we were ready, we said yes, gave her our order and walked off. Didn't ask if we wanted another drink besides the water we ordered and my mom and I were hoping to order adult beverages. She brought our food and I had to tell her that my mom wanted a margarita. She asked the basic questions about the drink and didn't ask if I wanted anything before she walked off.  When she came back with my moms drink, my mom had to tell her that I wanted something and she didn't ask what I wanted just stood there waiting for me to tell her. There's a card on the table that states they have draft beer specials and I had to ask which beers they had. The food was decent except for the presentation. We ordered the fiesta combo which consisted of a taco, tostada, and an enchilada. When the plate came everything just seemed to be piled on the plate. I ate my taco right away but if I didn't it wouldn't gotten super soggy as did my tostada. I feel that this will be our first and last visit."}
{"text":"I love/d this food. As a mattas lover for over 32 years this is/was my favorite place. From main st or Higley or dobson I'll take whatever mattas I can/could  get! However nothing is more upsetting than their absolutely TERRIBLE customer service!!!! The website says they are open till 11 but upon going at 955 we were turned away on a Sat night. I'm debating if I can even tolerate the  incompetent people here and rude staff.  If your website says open you should be open. I am beyond frustrated w this."}
{"text":"I really like Matta's but I understand why others have posted negative reviews.  I have been going here (including the original location on Main Street) for about 25 years.  The service is questionable sometimes, but I always enjoy the food.  It is not the \"light and healthy\" type of food that is trendy now, it is cheesy, heavy, delicious Mexican food.  I don't always want heavy food, but when I do, Matta's hits the spot."}
{"text":"Overall, the food was pretty good. I need to bump a couple stars down because of the service.  First thing when we walked in, there were no hostesses or servers to be seen (it was not anywhere near busy, either).  A few minutes later we go seated.  I had the chicken flautas and chicken tortilla soup. Soup was honestly very tasty. My father had a chimichanga of sorts, which he loved. Good portions, delicious chips and salsa. My sister on the hand had a bit of trouble. She ordered a 1 item lunch combo, with cheese enchilada (vegetarian). Neither the rice nor beans were veg, but that was to be expected given the use of lard and chicken stock in Mexican beans and rice. So we simply asked if there was another side we could substitute. Now, my sister and I both work in food service as well, and this seemed like a reasonable suggestion. Except they offered nothing. Not even a side salad... unless you could the pile of shredded iceberg lettuce with an olive and some blue cheese dressing a viable \"side salad replacement\" that the server so \"generously\" offered us. Of course, both enchilada sauces ALSO contained lard, so she essentially got a corn tortilla with some cheese and a heaping pile of iceberg lettuce. Pretty disappointing, knowing what else should have been done in such situations."}
{"text":"Our waitress took forever to get the drinks, the chips, and our order. My wife got a margarita, for a mixed drink that comes from a tap, I guess it was okay. When I got my enchilada/taco dinner I was rewarded with a blandness of flavor you just don't get very often. The most interesting part of the meal was my friend who ordered the potato taco, it resembled a flattened dead rodent more than a taco. I'm amazed that she even took a bite of it. I did laugh heartily at her frowned expression after trying it, so it was good for comedic value.  I did go to the old Matta's a few years back and it was decent, but seriously, don't waste your time going here."}
{"text":"The food taste generic and our server was kind of rude. The salsa was a joke. Not going back."}
{"text":"We enjoyed lunch here! We had great service! Melina was our server, She was fantastic!  Love her! Very sweet and attentive!  Try their chili rellenos best I've ever had!   This will be a favorite!"}
{"text":"Do not go here with party of more than 2 people or on a Sunday worst service. Repeatedly asked for more drinks with meal never came. They were not busy but all the wait staff hid in kitchen. Will not ever go there again. Food is marginal !! Quality has gone down in last couple years. To point there is none. Yesterday was my last visit ever!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Mattas for 15 years. Tonight my family came in and it wasn't busy but it took 20mins for the girls to clean off a table for us. After sitting down we got chips and that was it. No one brought us water or anything. We waited 10mins and started looking around and saw servers sitting and taking a break instead of helping us. I know that this place is not known for fast food, but completely ignoring us is crazy. I have 2 young children with me and it is not easy waiting for service when it is fast. We decided to leave and told the girls at the front that we never were helped out. They gave me a dirty look and didn't even say a word....not a sorry or let's make it better. I am very disappointed because Mattas has been a part of my family for a long time. I will not go back."}
{"text":"Ate here and got food poisoning. Rude service and food ended up costing me a lot more than my bill."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Staff wasn't that friendly, it felt like an inconvenience to ask for anything, and service was exceptionally slow.   The food wasn't very flavorful and the margaritas tasted like they had some soda water mixed in. It took forever to get our food & my friends was cold.   The sopapillas are more crunchy than soft and fluffy. Was very disappointed.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I have no connection to the restaurant and my review is based on honest opinion.....The food IS special and way above average for a Mexican restaurant..... but cannot BELIEVE anyone would think this restaurant is only average or nothing special.  Give this family owned restaurant a try....they have survived decades  in the restaurant business and definitely not a franchise typical chain,  Check out their history and better yet try a meal at their great restaurant on Dobson, you'll be back."}
{"text":"The food here at Mattas is average at best. However way over priced. I ordered a chile relleno taco combo, and added an additional taco at a cost of 6.99 for the added taco. To add to my surprise of the cost of the ala carte taco is how the food was plated, both tacos were resting in the beans and relleno sauces making them soggy and unable to be picked up. I was surprised a restaurant that's been in business this long does not know or show their cooks how to properly plate food. All this being said my family and I have been three times and will not be going back."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa were pretty good. The prices were pretty high and there was not much of a selection. The beans and rice were so bad! I usually will suck down the beans and rice everywhere else even if they are mediocre but these were just plain nasty! Don't know what kind of recipe they are using but this was a deal breaker for me. I would not eat here again. They did have a surprisingly delicious veggie burrito. My boyfriend said it was a zillion times better than his beef taco and burrito. Still, you would expect it to be good for ten bux!"}
{"text":"Bar Side: A friend and I usually come here for the chimi's... we like em. salsa is good as well. The service however has always been unpleasant. The servers are around but, whether they are on their phone, chatting with friends, or messing with the POS system, you feel ignored. Normally we put up with it and just eat and leave. This last time just irritated me because of the response I got. We entered around 720pm, sat at the bar. Waited about 10 min. patiently before they greeted us and some more time to clear the bar of old plates. Finally, he rushes us and says kitchen's closing in 1 minute. (Note they don't want to serve you food 30 min. before closing time). So we ordered 2 plates of chimi's like normal. Came out rather quick. Cut into it and it was cold. Not warm ish. Cold! The other was the same but out of politeness my friend kept hers. I sent it back. The bartender says its prolly just because they are rushing. Whatever, I know they just gave us 2 leftover chimi's and failed to heat them back up. Meanwhile about 10 min later a table that came in around 745 had fresh sizzling fajitas coming out... On top of all this they forgot our sides... I finally asked to have the ticket modified for some kind of discount. He replied I have no control over the kitchen. Im thinking, okay I didn't know I pay the chef separate. His response for the sides were... you didn't ask for any... Im thinking geez, I didn't ask for the bitter tasting lettuce either but you filled half my plate with it. Idiot. I said nothing. And just paid. A good waiter will ask do you want rice or beans? because it comes with the meal. In the end we paid full price. Got attitude rather than apologies. I choose to go else where from now on."}
{"text":"Absolutely will not visit this place again! I was at the bar trying to enjoy a drink and an appetizer when a group of annoying customers started to make racist comments about Mexicans. Then the bartender with the disgusting ear gauges decided to join on the conversation and empowered them continue.  All of this while they're at a Mexican restaurant eating Mexican food! I will not recommend this place to anyone or much less set foot in this establishment as long as this is tolerated!"}
{"text":"This is the type of place you take your no-so adventurous gringo friends from out of town. Their food has been dumbed down for the snowbird, midwest visitor type of crowd. If you like real authentic mexican food this will not be your place but if you dont mind a bunch of TV screens all over and having some average food you may want to check it out."}
{"text":"This location has a very nice atmosphere and the Service was outstanding! The food isn't anything to special but it comes out hot and it tastes like traditional Mexican food. This place also fills the need for a good chimichanga and if unsure what Mexican food place to go to your always safe with Mattas."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Waited 15 min just for water. Food was mediocre at best. Never coming back"}
{"text":"1. Local multi-generational restaurant. Everything made from scratch. I've never been disappointed with the food. Service starts with complementary fresh chips and salsa, hot or mild.   2. Attentive, knowledgeable bartenders who are not pushy.   3. This is a Mexican restaurant. If you insist on vodka or whiskey based drinks, you'll get them, but every bottle you see displayed behind the bar is tequila. Plus a decent set of domestic and Mexican beers on tap.  4. Try the soups as the weather turns cool: albondiga soup and a very zippy vegetable soup with big chunks of potato and chili slices."}
{"text":"Service was quick. Our waitress was great. Spotted we were low on drinks right away and filled them. Also, enjoyed the happy hour discounts on drinks and food til 6 p.m. the margarita was small, but it packed a punch..a yummy one. I had the 3 taco combo. The chicken one is my favorite, then the shredded beef, and then the ground beef taco. The beans were so fresh and the rice was a happy surprise. I loved the hot salsa that came with chips. This will be our new go to Mexican place. Also, it's like a palace inside."}
{"text":"Very average food. Pretty poor customer service. After seating ourselves in the bar area, it took about 7-8 minutes for anyone to come give us a menu and drinks. Then it took about 15 minutes for our food to come. Very slow customer service and just average food. Probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This place has both great food and outstanding customer service! The food doesn't take long to hit your table like some Mexican food places.   Our waitress was spot on! She was friendly and attentive just at the right times.   The Spanish rice is authentic and full of flavor! I'm very satisfied with my Mexican food experience at Mattas! Thanks guys, keep it up."}
{"text":"Fairly generic, bland Mexican food. My wife's family went to the old location for years and they have fond memories of good food there. I was never a big fan, but tonight's meal ended it for us. Tacos were boring. Sangria was so bad that my mother-in-law sent it back. My chicken chimichanga was fine, nothing special, but not bad. My wife's flan had to be sent back. I didn't get a refill on water the entire meal. There are so many good - better - Mexican restaurants out there. On the plus side, I like the interior, and kids like the cheese crisps. Oh well."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Matta's for a little over a year. I love this place and the lovely staff. Gretchen and Pete are some of the friendliest owners I've ever had contact with. I couldn't recommend this place more. The food is delicious, the margs are to die for, and the beer is always cold. Love love love this local joint."}
{"text":"I was in town for a meeting and had about an hour to grab lunch.  I like places like this because there's usually a bar where you can eat and watch TV and not be the creepy dude alone at a table.  With the decision to sit at the bar, sometime comes less than exceptional service since the bartender is making drinks for the entire restaurant and keeping up with everyone else at the bar as well.  But I had really great service and a fine meal at Matta's.  It wasn't packed, so maybe that helped but Ana, the young lady behind the bar, was friendly, checked in on me a few times and was quick to get me a second drink when she noticed I was running low.  The food was above average as well.  Not sure when I'll be back in Mesa, but this place will certainly be on my short list."}
{"text":"I wish this place were better, because it is in a very convenient location in Riverview and it is the only Mexican place in Riverview, but it is just so so.  I don't like the salsa; I find it too tangy.  Other people don't seem to mind, but I'm not a fan.  (Personally, Rosita's has the best salsa for texture and flavor).  So without the salsa, it's hard to get excited.  Apparently the staff feel the same way, as I have found them to be just flat.  No vim, no vigor, no excitement, nada.  Take the order, deliver the food, that's it.  They also use the cart method (like Si Senor's) as opposed to trays to deliver the food, which isn't necessarily bad, but get nicer looking carts if they are going to be around everywhere.  Apparently Matta's is a Mesa \"institution\".  If that's the case, perhaps they're in a rut and it explains the general blahness."}
{"text":"Some friends told us to try it out.  Has mixed reviews on yelp.  I thought Matta's was great.  They give you two salsa's and the spicier one is the best i have has in AZ.  The food is good.  Very nice restaurant.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Liked the atmosphere and the server was fast and attentive. The food was not good - salad was inedible, not much flavor to the fajitas. The margaritas were not good."}
{"text":"So I went here last friday with a group of coworkers.  My ratingL is meh for the food. There is goods and bad's, but all in all it isn't worth returning.  Let me start off by saying the restaurant is very clean and the wait staff was super friendly.  Our waitress was great.  So onto the food.  I had a lunch special.  Beef Taco, Red Cheese enchilada and beans.  I really dislike when places use manufactured taco shells that seem like the ones you can buy at a grocery store.  They taste like cardboard.  Stop using them!  If Fillyberto's can make theirs on the spot, so can you.  The enchilada sauce also tasted like the stuff you get in the can or in grade school lunches.  Wasn't a fan.  The salsa were good and so were the beans. But the taco and enchilada, two basic things, were just meh.  Sorry guys, won't return."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. I use to go to this restaurant when it was in downtown Mesa. The prices are higher and the food not near as good. Even the lettuce on our plates had brown pieces in it. So sad :-("}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for years, when they moved from Main Street I was sad and loved the atmosphere. They showed up at this place and I was glad to see the food hadn't changed and the brought an updated atmosphere with them. There still have some of the same waitress as the old location. My last visit was after a surgery and I had specific diet restrictions, the waitress and cook were very accommodating and made it a wonderful visit. It is a must when family visits or just want good reliable Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I have been here on several occasions and the service is never great but today was horrible. Wait to order drinks is ridiculous. Waitress did not recognize an order for chile verde. Saw half the restraunt get refills of chips and drinks but we are not offered any. Food was fine but hate to see half the restraunt get service but if you have the wrong waitress expect nothing. No manager around apparently customer service has zero priority."}
{"text":"Tried this place because it was nearby. Food came out fast, service was good. However, the food was pretty average. Salsa didn't have much flavor and the fish tacos were bland."}
{"text":"Not really that good. Wish I wrote the review then because I remember there were quite  a few things I wanted to say but lucky for them I waited on review and food was just not good enough that I remember how we vowed not to ever return.  Both hubby and I not impressed and not coming back.  I would suggest you start reading your reviews and get a new cook or try some new recipes because your food no longer works and I would like you to be successful because I love Mexican food and I want more places to go."}
{"text":"Excellent Tex-Mex restaurant. The decor at this restaurant is really pretty and the service is excellent. And the food is really yummy. I've ordered lots of different dishes off the menu and never had a bad meal. It's all good."}
{"text":"Not the best, not the worst Mexican food I've ever had.  Clean place, good ambiance, friendly staff.  Not bad for a quick bite and just on par with the other chain Mexican joints in my opinion.  Definitely wouldn't avoid it, but it's not a 5 start dining experience.  Left full as the portions are big, especially for the price.  Good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"This is  the  second  time we  have gone to  Matta's @ Riverview. The first  experience  was  bad  with my  Chimi  being uncooked and like  raw  dough! Horrible!  We  never  went  back for  over  two years. Went out  with friends  last night~  their  choice and  their  treat. Decided  to  try their  ribeye steak. Absolute  HORRIBLE!  The steak was all  fat, too rare, the garlic  bread  was  just  regular toast that was  so toasted  and  hard it  could have broke  your tooth. The lettuce in the salad  was  wilted  and  horrible! I  have  never  been to a restaurant  that  had EVERYTHING  on  the  plate  SO  bad!  Glad  i  will not  be  going ther  ever  again  and  glad  that i wasn't  paying  for  the  tab either."}
{"text":"Yelp Hours say they are closed on Sundays but they are open. This place is a lot nicer than the original location on Main St in down town Mesa. The food is not as authentic, missing the orignal location."}
{"text":"I have to agree with some of the reviews here and say the place would serve itself well and rethink the image they would like representing the restaurant. The service is below average and the staff look and act like it's a hang out. I never write reviews but felt it needs to be expressed."}
{"text":"Sufficient wine but that is not why you come here. The ambience is great, I am an American of Mexican descent and the music is what I grew up with. The food is excellent. The only reason for a 4 star rating is the service. The server was pleasant and helpful, when she came to the table, which was few times and far between. I had to go to the bar and ask for her once and it still took her to be at a different table and me flagging her down. Good thing I was motivated!  I will come back though and give them another chance."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here.  It was a pleasant surprise.  The food was good.  I had a green chili pork burrito, which was deceptively filling.  The pork tasted excellent, and the added guacamole and sour cream on top made it even better.  The lemonade was also great.  Service was excellent.  They always brought more chips just as we were running out, and the beverages were well stocked.  The best part of the whole meal was the cream filled churros.  With all the sugar on it, the cream is totally unnecessary, but who's complaining?  Strawberry and whipped cream to dip it in just pushed it over the top."}
{"text":"Went here because a customer was raving about how great it is.  I ordered the chili rellenos and was not disappointed.  They were great.  Food was excellent.   Prices are moderate. The place is a little tricky to find. Just head over in the direction of the Cinemax and it is in that corner. The main entrance is in the pedestrian zone.  There is a \"back door \" from the parking lot side that you can enter that brings you through the bar."}
{"text":"Horrible most unprofessional staff I've ever seen.   After two friends had a disagreement and one friend started yelling and cussing at the other.  I took 3 of my friends and left the establishment.   While sitting on the bench by the curb waiting for the Uber, the woman owner along with customers following came outside got in my face and screamed \"get the fuck out of here!\"  I told the lady who I had never spoke to before that I was no longer in her establishment and on public property so she needed to get out of my face.  In addition I told her I had done nothing wrong.  She continued to scream profanities and informed me several times that she is the owner.   This was completely uncalled for since I had never spoke to her before and I had already separated the two friends that had a disagreement. And we were on public property.  In addition to the poor staff,  the drinks are over priced and the meat on the nachos tasted like what can dog food smells like.    I highly recommend not supporting a place with such disrespectful owners and subpar food."}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love this place! Where else can you get $4 margaritas and $3 beers EVERYDAY before 6pm? The fajitas are amazing, but we always ask for them a bit more caramelized, cooked just a tad longer, as the sauce gets very rich this way. Best Chimichanga in all of Phoenix and their spicy salsa is seriously the bomb. I go here every time I'm in Phoenix. We don't have Mexican like this in San Francisco. So very good!"}
{"text":"I just finished eating here and it was outstanding. Fast friendly service, great atmosphere, and the best Mexican food I've eaten in Arizona. I ordered the two item combo that came with rice and beans. I chose a fish taco and a tamale, both were excellent. The tamale had the right amount of heat and also the right ratio of masa to meat, and a brown sauce covered it which was homemade and delicious. The fish taco had a unique salsa that I've not had before, tangy, not too tartar sauce like, but really good, and the fish was a large piece that was very lightly battered. The rice and beans were perfect too! It's so refreshing to find a place that gets it all right!"}
{"text":"The food was great.  We were here from out of town. Our hotel recommended it and it eas a great recommendation.  The wait staff was great in helping us through the menu.  I had Roberts Tacos combo and it tasted great."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite and got ice cold food with slow service and it was dead inside on a Friday night.  That should have told me something.  Nothing looked good on the menu but ordered anyways.  Wrong,  returned my food but lost my appetite by then and didn't want to try anything else.  Fyi, our food came out about 5 min after we ordered.  I don't think they actually cook it.  Must have been microwaved or in my case scooped out of the fridge. Good luck if you want to try it."}
{"text":"This place is totally average, and I mean that in a good way. There is absolutley nothing special about the food here. Infact, its toned down \"white person mexican food\"  Good place to eat if you are not into having an adventure or if you are taking people out that you do not want to offend. Its a nice place, high ceilings, clean, nice atmosphere. Not a \"Cantina\" by any means. Very tame place"}
{"text":"I used to enjoy this restaurant when it was on Main Street in Mesa. I went to their new location in the Riverview Mall yesterday, and was told that a $15 entree came with either rice OR beans, and if I wanted both, I would have to pay a few dollars extra. I have never been to a Mexican restaurant where they were so cheap, they wouldn't serve rice AND beans, which cost about .30 cents a piece to make. We had to make it to a movie, and didn't have time to go to another restaurant, so we stayed. The food was basic and nothing to justify their high prices and cheap servings. It is a shame to see a restaurant be in such financial dire they have to rip off their customers, but in all sincerity, if you can't afford to serve a decent meal, then it's time to close your doors. Unless you want to throw your money away on a basic, bland meal, I wouldn't recommend Mattas."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Matta's the food is great and we always receive great customer service."}
{"text":"Have been a fan of this restaurant but tonight we were disappointed. The albondigas soup was not good. It was full of carrots, no potatoes or rice. Not enough cilantro and broth was weak. The cook needs to be given a lesson on how to make true albondiga soup, the real Mexican way."}
{"text":", SO BAD, YOU COULD GO TO JAIL !!!!!!                               MATTAS MEXICAN GRILL AND CANTINA  I'm not kidding. We found a movie theater so cool (Cinemark, with electric lazyboy chairs), at Mesa Riverview. We see alot of movies and go out to eat often. When we found Cinemark, we knew we needed a good place to eat before going to our shows.   We found Mattas Mex. Grill & Cantina almost next door to the theater. Perfecto. We love Mexican food. We made reservations for my birthday, showed up on time and ordered drinks. ( one margarita and sodas). Our drinks arrived as did chips and salsa. Chips were average, not warm, and the salsa very mild. As per the norm for us, we asked for hot salsa. Our server told us, \"We have hotter salsa, but you have buy the entire jar\". WTF!!!   Okay, got over that fairly quick and we ordered food, the server assuring us we would make it to our movie in 45 min.   After 25 min. had passed, we inquired about our food, reminding our server about our show next door in 20 min. We figured we would have to eat in a hurry to make it. More drinks were brought to us while we waited.   After 45 min. we were pretty upset. Still no food, no server, and no more time. We got up, I searched out our server, found him at the kitchen door. He said with a smile \" your food is done, it'll be right out. REEEEEEALY!!!!!   I informed him, we had no time left and we had to leave. He said \"one moment please, I'll get your bill\" ????   I asked to see the manager. HOLY CRAP. Out walked this 20 year old, with half a jewelry box pierced into his head and face, tattooed from head to toe. (this is the face of Mattas?)   When I explained that our birthday dinner plans were ruined and we had to leave and would no longer be needing their food, he said, \" would you like it to go?\". I said \"no, we're going to the movies and can't take it in\". He handed me a $22 drink bill and said we had to pay for the drinks. I couldn't believe my ears. I explained that, ANYwhere else in town would have apologized, and waived the drink cost   due to length of our wait, and spoiling a birthday dinner, and ask us to come back and let them try again another time. (and we would have).   To my amazement,he told us that we could have the food for free. There were six of us. I stared at him for a moment, and reminded him that we're going to a movie and can't take food in, and reminded him that we wouldn't have had the drinks and refills, if we had known our food wasn't to arrive on time.    NOW IT GETS WEIRD    Out of the blue, I swear to Christ. He said, \"do I have to call security?\" My friends and I looked at each other dumbfounded. As if maybe he's not talking to us. After we regained our composure we asked, why? He told us because we refuse to pay our bill. At NO time did we refuse.   Totally humiliated in front of the staff and patrons, we asked his name. His response was the answer to it all. DOMINIC MATTA. (family) . They had to hire him.  We reiterated, We, at no time even insinuated we would not pay our bill. This happened ONLY in his head and he decided to blurt it out in front of god and everybody. In a loud voice he then ordered our party to leave imediately. We started to leave and I heard \"please\" for the first time. \"Please pay your bill\". I did, and we left. I will post this at every opportunity, and on every website I can find, so nobody  suffers as we have at the hands of the Matta family.   I've edited my review so those that profess the ability to read between the lines quit whining"}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre. The chips were the best part. The salsa was basically tomato sauce. I had the shrimp fajitas. Obviously a pre-prepared item with soggy shrimp and soggy vegetables. My son ordered the bean burro sans cheese. Did not get it right on the first try and we left disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a Mesa community staple. It had to move from its original location on main street a few years ago and relocated to Riverview. Whenever we are in the area I'm always happy to eat there. I always gets Robert's Taco with rice and beans."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food reasonably priced, and gracious, welcoming staff. The Cadillac Margaritas could have been better, but were acceptable. We would return if in the area again."}
{"text":"This is a very clean and well appointed Mexican restaurant in Mesa, Az.  We enjoyed chips, salsa, margaritas, appetizers and our entrees.  I felt the service, atmosphere, drinks and appetizers outperformed the entrees.  However it was a great dinner and good experience.   The prices were reasonable.  I'd suggest the restaurant use larger shrimp in their fajitas.  I personally do not like the smaller ones."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere in this restaurant. Went during lunch time and it was very quiet and they had some nice lunch specials. I loved how spacious the booths were as well, having a baby in an infant car seat.   I loved how they had 2 different salsas to choose from. Their chicken burro was very good. Our waitress was great at keeping our drinks filled and out food came out quickly."}
{"text":"Not bad... Not great. Pretty middle of the road. Our server was really, really nice though.  The chips seemed stale and the salsa (pico) was nothing special.  The chicken taco I ordered was really good.... lots of shredded chicken in a corn shell. The beans and rice were standard."}
{"text":"Your typical mex cantina food, nothing special you probably couldn't find in most cities in america. They have a few items on the menu for the kids and those not looking for mex food. Staff is knowledgable on menu and can make recommendations. The bar has tv's to watch your sporting events and the patio is nice during cooler months. Would recommend to anyone looking or a place to take the family. The wait staff very attentive and I always tip extra because of the great service."}
{"text":"Been here a few times over the last couple of months and always good food. The salsa is one of my favorites with hot fresh chips.   We normally eat at the bar and this one is never crowded.  Came in to watch the last quarter of Vikings Saints game knowing we could watch the game.    We will be back next time I'll take Pics and detailed review.   Recommend Matta's because we live in Scottsdale and really not much in the way of decent Mexican food."}
{"text":"First time to this location, haven't eaten here since they were on Main Street in Mesa (a loooong time ago). Tried a cheese enchilada, 3 tacos with ground beef, shredded chicken and shredded beef, and the shredded beef was the most outstanding item of all, very flavorful and mouth-watering!  Overall, the food was just average, not overly remarkable, but I would still recommend a visit, as there are MANY menu items that could very well be better than the basic items we ordered.  Service was good, we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"I was too hard on Matta's in my first review.    Been back several times since and have to say so I really like this joint now.  Their chips and salsa are good, the service is friendly and fast, and their house margaritas feature good tequila!  Try the bean dip, the fajitas and finish it off with some fresh fried ice cream.  Your belly will thank me later."}
{"text":"The food is good and interesting.   To me, the service is unfriendly and unhelpful.  Don't try to make any substitutions.   If you go outside to the back, you can see in the kitchen.  It wasn't as clean as I prefer.  But then again, most restaurants don't have a door to look through.    Everything I have eaten was good.    Taco Tuesday is a great deal."}
{"text":"We are having a nice birthday dinner.  We got here early,  pleasantly surprised it was happy hour! ! 2 taco with rice dinner, 5.99!!  Soo good and reasonable! !  Come hungry the portions are large."}
{"text":"I really like Matta's Grill & Cantina at Mesa Riverview for lunch. I used to work Downtown Mesa and would go to the original Matta's. Now I work in Scottsdale and hit the Mesa Riverview location fairly regularly.   I hesitate to write this review and spoil a good thing, but if you go here and go in the South entrance in the Cantina you will sit yourself right away and will be served very quickly. If you are lucky you will be served by Sindy (I don't know? - that's what it says her name is on my receipt) or another young guy who waits there. They will never let your drink go empty. In the Cantina the staff can see your table from behind the bar so you are never out of sight - out of mind.   If you have some business to do, all the better. They have several very large tables where you can sit a laptop while you are having a discussion and there is plenty of room to push the papers and computers aside when it is time to eat. They will never make you feel rushed and the Cantina is seldom at capacity so it's not a problem to hang out. Also lots of TVs with Sports and sometime news on. The only downside is the management likes baseball. I would rather watch the ice melt in my drink (but I can't because the wait staff fills it often). So this is my go-to place if I have a meeting where we are going to work while we eat.  Downside: They don't have very good lunch specials. It typically is a $1 off of a single-item combo or $2 of a two-item combo. But the menu is a pretty good value anyway so that's certainly not a deal-breaker for me. You have to ask to fill you salsa. But if you do, they will fill it no problem. Also, i spend a little more on tips here due to the excellent service.   Patio is nice when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Awesome fajitas!!! Really good chicken tortilla soup. Diet Dr. Pepper with cherries   I definitely recommend this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here since they moved their location from Main Ave in Mesa location.  No one at the front to greet us when we arrived and when the gentleman seated us,  he lacked a personality.  Should have left at that point.  We ordered chimis and the amount of food was great,  it was hot and exactly as we ordered.  However being the picky eater I am I asked for no condiments,  However instead I'd like cheese with my chimi.  When the bill came we were charged $2 more for cheese. Or waitress coyly answer why it was more.  Very poor. ...I would have appreciated the heads up for the extra change.  There are plenty of other restaurants to patronize.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"My first visit here, and it did not disappoint. Food was good and had fair portions. Staff was friendly and informed us about Happy Hour specials- $3 cheese crisps (amazing!) and $4 Matta's Margaritas.   Interior is beautiful and clean. Displayed at the front door is their March 2014 county health inspection grade: A. Dining area is spacious and inviting. Cantina is a fun area with sports on the TVs.   My party ordered a diverse selection off the menu, and each item was great! Will definitely be coming back.   Since Top Shelf on Southern closed, this is the next best thing- maybe better."}
{"text":"This place was attractive and clean. And the service was good.  But the food left so much to be desired. The menu is a bit limited. The chips were not hot, and the two sauces served with the chips were not great - the chunky version was so acidic and it was bitter.  I wanted to eat light my last visit, so I just ordered a cheese crisp. I asked for green onions (scallions) on it, and was told they did not have green onions. They offered white onions instead. What kind of Mexican food place doesn't have green onions in their kitchen?  Underwhelmed!  But they had free wi-fi so I was able to post this two-star review while I was sitting in their dining room!"}
{"text":"Matta's has a very pleasing atmosphere, nice furniture and friendly staff.  I goto restaurants to eat though. The food was so boring and bland. It made me sick that they overcharged for Taco Bell shells, picante canned salsa, and slop style presentation.   I recommend Serrano's. Never eat at Matta's. horrible food, horrible."}
{"text":"The queso dip is made like \"white trailer trash folks\" make on Super Bowl Sunday, yellow like Velvetta. I was hoping for a true Mexican white queso dip made with Oaxaca/Monterey Jack blend. No such luck. Also, small portion for the amount paid. It is served in a small tortilla bowl that has perhaps only a ladle full inside it. Not even half full.  Our waiter was quick, efficient, and pleasant. He promptly took our order, served our meals, refilled our drinks, cleared the table, and delivered the check without any waiting time or having to ask.   The food was served hot and quick. There were no combo plate numbers like 1 through 40. We were not offered a lunch menu at 12:30pm on Friday. Therefore, I do not believe they offer lunch prices. The pricing on the menu I feel is a little more expensive than most other Mexican restaurants. The salsa was delicious. I like the one with fresh green onions and chunky tomatoes the most. I like salsas that have a thick consistency over the watered down ones. The two that are served are of perfect consistency. I had the chili relleno and enchilada. Nice cheesy & the enchilada sauce was delicious. My friend had some sort of meatball soup. He seemed to enjoy it. He didn't make any comments about it."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and only eaten at the bar but this weekend, I sat in the dining room for a nice meal with my boyfriend. We walked in around 8:30PM on a Saturday night and didn't wait, although the dining room was pretty full. The booth was very spacious, could have easily fit 4-6 people. Chips and salsa were quick to arrive and the salsa is really amazing! Our waitress took our drink orders and was surprised when she said I couldn't have sugar around the rim of my margarita glass. Hmm...never encountered that one before. Margaritas were delicious though and only $4! We each had 2, they were kinda small. For dinner, I ordered chicken fajitas and my boyfriend ordered a burro with rice and beans. Our food came pretty quick and was really delicious! The fajitas came with different types of bell peppers, onions and tomatoes. Really good! The sour cream is also a little different, but good! Service was prompt, nothing over the top though. I would definitely recommend Matta's for good Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 20. We had gotten there early and still it took 30 min to get seated. Dinner was fine except we had one server and he was overwhelmed. When we were done the server brought out everything on one bill. We asked to have it split as we were all separate couples. The server said he could separate them but encouraged us to just note what was ours on the bill. So we each listed what needed to be on each card and turned it over. After 10 min. The server came out and said he could not split it this way. This is after some in our party hearing him tell another employee that \"this is stupid, it makes no sense.\" While he looked at our bill. We were then asked to split it even by 12 cards. We agreed, but he then came back and said the register would only let him split it 6 ways. In the end, we put it on one card and will not be returning."}
{"text":"They were 5 stars then for some reason the kitchen lost their minds. Orders were wrong more than they were right and the previously helpful and sweet staff are now cranky and don't seem to want to help. Their recipes are the same. If you can get the right food it is always delicious.  Exactly what you think great Mexican food should be... But the bar is open...they have the best margaritas in town and half of their staff doesn't know what a reposado tequila is. Sad. Their good manager either retired or left.  They need to revisit the reason they were standing room only in down town Mesa. It is not location.  It is consistency of the food and the staff.  I could just cry...oh well lots of Mexican places nearby to try.  Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**  Complimentary chips and two types of salsa - mild and hot. Personally, the mild tasted like salsa from a jar, and the hot was extremely mild.   Appetizer: Cheese Crisp I was expecting some type of nacho scenario, but it was a tortilla covered in melted cheese. Almost like an open-faced quesadilla. The cheese tasted like kraft sliced cheese.  Main Course: Bean and Cheese Chimichanga al a carte Extra star up for being able to make this! Most places are too afraid to fry something with beans. Came with a side of sour cream and guacamole. Unfortunately my guacamole was more avocado tasting than guacamole tasting. The chimichanga also comes with your choice of red or green sauce on top. The red sauce is a fire roasted/smoked sauce, and the green is a cilantro base. Green over red.   There is no real al a carte menu, but everything on there could be made al a carte. Definitely a hefty portion for an al a carte, but the price wasn't very al a carte friendly. For an extra $2 I could have had a whole meal. I recommend getting a full size entree.   Almost everything could be made vegetarian friendly, so it was definitely nice. Great decor and a great family place. Just not my first choice."}
{"text":"I have loved this restaurant for almost 25 years now. I followed it from location to location because their chips and salsa (the spicy one), their rolled soft chicken tacos, and their beans and rice are all to die for. I order the same thing every time because I can't bear to miss out even if there may be another delicious item (which I'm sure there is). For example, my mom loves their beef tacos.   The service is always good, the food always comes quickly, and it's a beautiful restaurant. I love the new design with the enclosed booths where you can have a nice private conversation. It's quiet and peaceful--a very nice way to dine. And the food is so inexpensive. Two people can have dinner and sodas for $25 including tax and tip. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the area for sure.  Great service from Dominic.  Hot sauce is good enough to be bottles for sure, and the food has an authentic flavor profile that I really enjoyed.   Had the carne asada tacos, carne Verde omelette and a bowl of the enchilada soup.  Food is lights out food and our experience was great.  Hopefully they can pull out of the shithole Riverview complex and into a space with higher traffic and more visibility.  Great job Dominic, keep up the great work and hang in there."}
{"text":"Matta's has been part of my life since the early '80's.  If you have read any of my Mexican cuisine reviews you know I'm all about the Tacos. And Matta's Robert's Tacos are the is quintessential model of the perfect taco's. Roberts's Tacos are primordial, they exist beyond time in order to exemplify Taco perfection.  These days Darcie and I tend to eat at the bar. And this past Friday, we sidled up and found ourselves sitting next to the parents of our daughter high school friend and teammate. They had just dropped off their college kiddo at Skyharbor as well. Serendipity! What a great visit and meal it was.   I could wax on about the History of Matta's and its place in my own personal history, because I do indeed have some awesome Matta's-related stories. But in expedient service to you, Yelping Homie, I shall cut to the chase.  Standard Cantina atmosphere, clean, with pleasant attentive staff.   The food:  Taco game - Stellar, but stick with the Roberts Tacos, the others come in a pre-made shell... and friends & neighbors, that's a non-starter for me.  Taco Salad - Transporting, and just the thing you need when you're thinkin about that pending blood draw.  Salsa game - The Regular gets 3.5 stars, the Hot gets 4.5 stars... the Hot is where Matta's shines.  Sides? - The rice and beans are fine accompaniments to your Taco adventure, but nothing to truly crow about.  The chips - Sadly the chips this go 'round tasted oily and stale. Mind you they arrived hot, they just tasted off.  If you have room left, I suggest the Sopapillas, they come with honey, or fried ice-cream... unless you really do have a pending cholesterol test.  I'll update later with the funny story of my Niece's boyfriend trying to fit in. It's a touching yarn about a high school lad trying to fit in by ordering a side of jalapeños just like his date's uncle. It's also a coming of age story wherein I communicate to my 11 year-old son the moral importance of not laughing at someone in distress as you drive them home.  Additionally, I have no moral qualms about sharing this distressed person's story. Let's call him Matt. Because that's his actual name. Again, no qualms because he cheated on my niece 6 months later.  Anyway, hilarious story pending.  For now, you want Mexican food, Matta's is a great place to start."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and have had good food each time. They close fairly early for a place that's right next to a movie theater, but it's worth it. The chips and salsa are free and they are delicous. The chips are lightly fried and not too salty and the salsa is the perfect amount of hot and not too chunky. They always have food specials along with their $4 margarita and I have not been disapointed. They offer vegetarian options for the food specials, which I appreciate. The service is friendly and fast and even though one night we ended up staying 30 min past closing time, I never feel like they are trying to push me out the door. This is a nice, cheap, yummy Mexican restaurant without any flashy side. It's good food for a good price. Good choice for hanging with friends, a meal before the movie or a casual night out with the SO. Not such a good choice for a first date where you're looking for romance and roses."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at Matta's Grill & Cantina. Our waitress was a delightful, and our food was super delicious. Very filling and satisfying. I had piping hot fajitas, with all the fixings while snacking on complimentary chips and salsa. It was a perfect time to go, because it wasn't busy at all. The restrooms were clean, and the atmosphere was relatively quiet. I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Food is fairly good. Atmosphere generally great especially on the second level. Margaritas need some work though, usually too weak."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chili Relleno Enchilada combo,  I received a plate the was so hot I burned my hand accidentally touching it. My food was lukewarm. My relleno  has ground beef in it so I returned it and ordered just an enchilada. The enchilada was filled with shredded unmelted cheddar cheese.  The chips and salsa were good.  Staff is friendly.   I didn't care for the food at all. Hurts to pay for it since I didn't eat it."}
{"text":"White people cooking Mexican food for other white people- and not very well!!!!!  This place is close to my work, so we decided to try it.....here's my review :  Not going back EVER. This is not Mexican food, this is white people's opinion of what Mexican food is-minus ANY flavor...... Which can be proven by coming in here and seeing ONLY white people dining. It was only white people last time we came, too (us included...) I mean, i think that right there is your sign, when real Mexicans won't even dine at a Mexican restaurant, then you're not getting authentic Mexican flavors. I can't believe the reviews say \"best salsa in the valley\" WHAAAAAATTTTT!!??!! I believe in fair honest reviews. So here: it was not good :/ today was my second time at this 'Mexican food' restaurant. Let me just tell you.....I have never ever tasted anything more bland LOL! The food was....pretty sad. Chips and salsa come out first, and the mild salsa tastes like tomato gazpacho...weird. I guess the person who said it was best in the valley likes tomato juice. Nothing wrong with that, but to me salsa should be bursting with flavors, cilantro, onion, garlic.......where were those flavors?? It honestly looks like tomato juice with bits of cilantro (that i couldn't taste) and chunks of stewed tomatoes. Sighhhhhhh. The hot salsa was just hot. No flavor. Ordered a cheese crisp as an appetizer-that was pretty delicious (should've ordered 5 of them and called it quits....but alas, we did not...) But it doesn't showcase any skill in the kitchen to toast cheese on a tortilla, so to me this doesn't count. Then, my friend and I ordered 2 taco's each. There was a 2 taco combination plate that came with rice and beans for $9 bucks, but we didn't want the rice or beans, we just wanted 2 tacos each. So we ordered one fish taco, one chicken taco, and 2 of the \"Robert's\" tacos (which our server said, and I QUOTE, was \"yum yum, one of the best items on the menu!\". ALL of the tacos were very very bland!!!!!! The 'Robert's taco' was a deep fried shredded beef taco, which I remember eating in Tucson as a kid. How do you mess up something deep fried???? By not seasoning it, that's how! Like, NO flavors. It tasted like cooked meat with no seasoning!!!!!! And how do you mess up SALSA???? I just don't understand. I was so severely disappointed. and then after all was said and done we waited a pretty long time to get our check. We had eaten half our tacos, and we both work in a restaurant as well so we didn't complain about the food (not sure it would've done any good anyway, even if they offered to recook it or another menu item.....we were so severely turned off that we just wanted out of there) But when the lady dropped our check she charged us for the $9 dollar 2 item combo!! Aww, insult to injury right there. And at that point I was ready to say something but guess what- She NEVER came back to take the payment from us after 10 minutes. So we'll never ever go back. It's funny, a lot of servers are elderly white ladies! WHAT!? LOL!!! Anyways. I was pretty severely disappointed. Coming from a seasoned restaurant worker, this was just a sad, sad day for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Love it. Gave only 4 stars because only been there once. Superb Mexican food. Chile Relleno was great, as was the Mexican pizza, and the house margaritas on rocks with salt was to die for, and only 4 bucks apiece, though the menu says 5.50.  Complimentary chips and salsas were all homemade, bottomless, and truly great.  The 2 combo meals above, plus 3 margaritas came to only 38 bucks!   Our Mexican waitress looked 70 yo and gave the finest service possible.  Building ambience first rate, parking is easy, and location is very handy and easily accessible.  Yes we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  You won't catch me complaining.  It's a little tucked away but totally worth it."}
{"text":"One word. AWSOME!   I've been a fan of this family owned restaurant for over 25 years.  Moved out of state for 10 (yes I had hot sauce shipped to me on a regular basis) and was elated to come back recently and find that the restaurant is STILL THRIVING!  It may not be on Main Street anymore (but that's OK... Have you seen Main Street lately??) but there are so many pieces of nostalgia inside and outside that make all of those wonderful memories come flooding back (even the Pac-Man game)!  The food continues to be incredible. My personal favorites are the Sandy's Special, Steak Picado, Roberts Tacos, Albondigas Soup and of course the all-time famous for a reason Chile Relleno Dinner (Who are we kidding... I could close my eyes and point to the menu it's all fantastic and delicious). You will definitely want to wash any of those down with the award winning margarita on the rocks!   The best in the valley by far!!!   And then there's the staff... Friendly, professional and always go the extra mile to make sure we are completely satisfied.  Things happen - but I will tell you this... They make it right and do so with a smile on their face.  It says something that several of their staff were on Main when I moved out of state and they're still there!! Now I'm seeing even second and third generation. It's awesome. Support local! Eat local!  This IS the spot! You won't be disappointed!  P.S. Don't forget to have some fried ice cream!!!"}
{"text":"I'll take any old Robertos anyday over this place. If I never went there again I'd be fine, but my wife will never change her mind....All I can hope for is that they go completely out of business soon :) jk!  Tacos are worse than taco bell and 4x the price...soggy chimichangas full of sloppy meat for 10 bucks.... It's pretty bad...unless you grew up eating it and that's all you know, I guess? P.S. WORST SERVICE EVER AT THIS LOCATION."}
{"text":"I think these reviews are unfair and had to comment. YES it is very much on the side of Americanized in the spectrum of Mexican restaurants. And I find it unfortunate that some people are offended by it's existence but I refuse to get political, it is a matter of taste. I have been to even blander Mexican restaurants and don't see it that way really. I like medium to less spicy stuff and enjoy their food. The staff has always been nice to us and given us the right order. Matter of opinion, but if you don't like super hot food and enjoy big portions and nice atmosphere this is a great place. They probably have spicier stuff that I just haven't tried..."}
{"text":"A perfectly good place for a chill Friday night dinner. I absolutely loved the atmosphere. Matta's has an upper level where every table is set up like a balcony over looking the main level, it feels like your in a courtyard. The only thing it's missing is an open look at the sky. There was also a mariachi band playing during the night which added to the appeal. And to make things really cool (at least to me), they did a Mexican version of the Godfather theme song. Loved it!   The chips and salsa came out right away. The hot had a kick to it, but wasn't very flavorful. The mild was excellent, but I prefer my Salsa hot. I tried combining the two, which was only okay. The menu isn't really anything special. It's a lot smaller than most Mexican restaurants, and is loaded with the standards. My girlfriend had a chicken burrito which she enjoyed. I had the chicken fajitas, which were good as well. The food was good, but not great enough to make me run back out.   The service was excellent. Our waitress was on top of everything despite the fact that we were on the upper level. We watched and felt a little bad as she had to run up and down the stairs (she usually took the stairs that weren't as visible, but you know what's going on) to get everything for us. I could imagine that if a server were having a bad enough day, they would just make people up there and wait.   We just randomly chose Matta's because we happened to be at Mesa Riverview. I enjoyed my experience there. While it's not a place that I'm dieing to try again, if someone suggests Mexican, and we're nearby, I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Bae and I stopped here for take out on our way home.  We decided to have a beer while we waited, so we bellied up to the cantina bar.  We ended up filling up on chips and salsa with our beers so we ate our meals later than expected.  Always on the hunt for great salsa, Matta's had a mild and a hot salsa that were perfect mixed.  The hot salsa lacks the chunks of the mild, which is what made the mix so good.  I cannot speak to the quality of the food since it had cooled down when we finally got hungry again, but was still good reheated.  We do plan to return for beers and apps at least.  A pint of Dos Equis was $5 and a house margarita was only $5.50.  These prices were outside of happy hour too.  There wasn't a huge crowd and the bartender was very attentive.  It was a nice experience and I am curious to try their food fresh."}
{"text":"Whoever made the cheese crisp (WOW) over-the top with cheese and it wasn't Mexican either just almost like velvetta..way to much !!  I ordered red pork tamale \"way to spicey\" for the average person, as if there was jalepeno pepper seeds in it..I eat tamale's all the time and never had one that spicey.  It ruined my dinner.  This locations food is NOT as good as the old location on Main Street \"probably NO owners there to oversee\"."}
{"text":"The food is bland beyond explanation. I typically judge whether a place is worth coming back by trying their green chile plate. I couldn't find the chile. It was more like a watery gravy. Lots more flour than chile. If you like your Mexican food on the gringo side, you'll like Mattas."}
{"text":"Decent.  Not great, but decent.  The flautas were over cooked, and it looked like the chimi was also.  Very friendly, attentive wait staff, who took care of us when the food was delayed due to kitchen issues.  Beautiful two-story interior with rustic decor.  Wound up here after walking out dissatisfied with Toby Keith's, and do not regret the decision.  Matta's is a family place with roots going back in the area decades.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"(NOTE: The 4-star review is strictly because of the salsa. Otherwise this is around a 3 and a half.) Yes, this place seems slightly too American but don't let that fool you. The food can actually be pretty good. They bring you two types of salsa. The hot salsa is really great. The saving grace of this place. Good enough to drink! Has a nice kick, with a hint of Habanero. Super addictive. I only wish the food was right there on par with the salsa. Again, it is good, It is just way on the heavy side. I personally like fresher, more clean flavors. This place is more of the \"Man VS. Food\" / \"Grease Trucks\" variety. My next complaint is that the Chorizo tacos could actually use a LOT more Chorizo. They seem to make them with literally around 30% chorizo and like 70% beans.  You seriously mine as well call them \"Bean Tacos\" (featuring special guest star Chorizo!). I have kindly asked them if I could just please get them with no refried beans but both times was told they cannot. I even mentioned that I would be OK with a slight up charge. Still no help. WTF? They already give you a HUGE side of refried beans. I do NOT need more. In spite of this the tacos still actually taste pretty good if you can deal with the lack of meat in them. The tamales are just OK, I have had better. The host and hostess I had on two occasions were kind of rude. Me and my buddy came in at around 9:15pm, I believe they were closing in 45 minutes... To me this is NOT too close to closing time. I am not someone who hangs around talking until you are ready to go home, I am always thoughtful, I  eat quick and get the heck out. They just obviously wanted to be doing anything else but working. Look, I don't blame them but hey, you are there to do a job... an easy one at that, At least pretend to be nice to people. The server I always seem to get            (a nice, older grey haired European lady) is beyond kind, super sweet and extra attentive. Overall this is an OK Mexican joint with pretty tasty food, just bring a big huge appetite, drink lot's of water to offset the salt dehydration and expect to take a lot home with you."}
{"text":"Sorry to say, will not go back :(  I had chile relleno and ground beef taco . I was surprised that the Chile relleno was stuffed with ground beef, and no it didn't taste very good . Ground beef in the taco was very very bland, no taste whatsoever . Chips and salsa was okay ."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Mattas since the 1950's.  There is no better Mexican food on the planet.  When you go, start with a cheese crisp, then have a #4.  The relleno, enchilada, and taco will make you a fan of this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was ok, spiced sour cream was good. I ordered stuffed shrimp quesadilla , wish it was hot and shrimp cut into pieces instead of whole shrimp falling out of every bite . My beau ordered steak picado - it's his favorite he loved it as it was perfectly spiced. Enjoyed chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Food is bland. Rice dried out, beans fresh out of a can. No taste. Not recommended.  Save your money. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Oh Matta's...how my boyfriend loves this place and I am always okay  with this being our go-to place before our adventures at Bass Pro Shops around the corner. He loves these specific tacos here. They are the \"Robert's Tacos\" he likes them dearly. Their menu here is not overly exciting, just straight up Mexican food fare. We have sat out on patio (with one of our dogs) and we have sat at bar. Horrible bar service.... The margaritas, while decent, strong and not overly sweet, they are small and could be bigger/less ice (comes in a rocks glass). The Robert tacos are great and the shredded chicken taco is decent. I like when the shredded chicken is stewed with some heat, it is here :)  There is one dish that recognition is definitely needed...their tamale.  My boyfriend gets one every time we come, always moist, very good balance of meat and masa and never an inconsistency in flavor. I had to edit my harsh review because honestly, forgot to include the excellent tamale in my review (sorry)  The chips and salsa...have had better, but their hot sauce is really good.   We will still go here, it is not terrible food by any means, food is great, just leaves a lot to wish you had more of, like more margarita instead of ice, service instead of none and salsa with some flavor :)"}
{"text":"Matta's has been a family favorite since My father was a young boy. We were sad when the original location closed in mesa on main street. Then they opened up a few years later at Mesa Riverview I have to say we are happy again this has been the most favorite place that my family loves to gather at. The food is excellent the staff are very friendly and some of them are the originals from the old place. I will certainly miss going with my father when ever we say Mattas he was ready to leave the house in less then 5 minutes. My father passed away in April but we will go on and always go to mattas in honor of him. BEST CHIPS AND SALSA EVER we can't eat there without eating at least 5 bowls of chips"}
{"text":"Authentic Tex-Mex food that will fill your belly and not break the bank. I highly recommend the hot salsa but they also have a mild version too. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and extremely fast. They have a wide selection of beers on draft as well as mixed drinks. The atmosphere is casual and the bar has several TVs that you can catch a game or sporting event on."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  I ordered the chicken taquitos appetizer.  Greasy, soggy tortillas.  How do you not get your tortillas crisp in a commercial fryer?"}
{"text":"We had lunch here today. It was excellent!  I loved the atmosphere.  The chips and salsa were good. I didn't care as much for the chunky mild sauce but the hot sauce was great. I had an enchilada and loved it. A little pricey at 6.00 for an ala carte but tasty none the less. My mom had a taco which was 5.50. All in all a good dining experience."}
{"text":"The food is okay. The cheese crisps are really good! The service is okay. The workers were very kind, however, we waited twice the amount of time they told us we would have to."}
{"text":"We went to Matta's for the first time (July 30, 2010) since recently reopening in the Mesa Riverview complex.  Word that they're back in business has spread quickly; when we arrived the waiting area was full and after we were seated 10 minutes later the line was out the door.  I returned the following evening with a friend and we were promptly seated.  The new location features a more modern and upscale look with a second floor for balcony type seating, but appears to offer less than half the capacity of the old space.  The layout seems somewhat awkward and cramped, especially the waiting area, which is basically a hallway situated between the foyer and bar.  However, the furnishings are very nice and appear to be hand carved, although they are quite bulky.  The first evening, I was expecting issues with food and service since they had only been open a few days.  It did take a while to be greeted by our server, but that's to be expected on a busy night anyway.  I ordered the Chile Relleno and a Dos Equis lager, and my better half ordered a combo plate with tacos.  She also loves guacamole so we of course ordered that too.  The guacamole was brought out within a few minutes, and the food shortly followed.  The Chile Relleno was awesome and plenty to eat.  The GF said her meal was also good, but indicated the beans had an unusual flavor.  I identified this flavor as \"smoky;\" I don't much care for beans anyway.  So, all in all, an excellent first visit despite my concerns about the recent reopening affecting quality of food and service.  The second evening, I had only expectations of a bomb dish.  I ordered the Chile Verde, and my buddy ordered a combo plate which I find boring because you can get tacos or what-have-you basically anywhere and they require no artistry in the kitchen.  The Chile Verde was solid, and although I would have liked more flour tortillas, I found it a very satisfying meal.  The server was consistently overly attentive, but she had only 2 tables and wanted to maximize her tips so I understood this and obliged.  For the second time, I enjoyed my experience at Matta's.  I highly recommend Matta's to anyone looking for great Mexican food and solid service; I find them far superior to any of their well known competitors.  The only reason I didn't award a 5 was because I've only dined at the new location twice."}
{"text":"The tables surrounding us were chalk-full of loud, nay practically screaming intoxicated 20-30 somethings clearly returning from the nearby baseball games.  Staff did nothing to quiet them down, nor cut them off.  Despite this, the chile relleno was excellent; however, the cheese enchilada and steak taco left something to be desired."}
{"text":"I have been loving Mattas since the late 70's on Main Street-todays chimichanga with green pepper sauce was so delicious-strawberry daquiri made just right..Wonderful lunch with fantastic waiter \"Dominick\" Thank YOU~"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we almost walked out of here. We could not understand anything on the menu. It was in English, that was not the problem. It's that everything was mish-mashed together. No rhyme or reason. Very difficult to figure out if what you were reading was a burrito, taco or what. If it wasn't for the waitress explaining it then we would have given up.   Husband ordered steak fajita burrito and I ordered chicken fajita burrito. Both were very good. Rice, beans  or any sides were extra which is different.   We would go back but probably just order the same thing cause we still can't figure out the menu. We're not the only ones. Waitress says she gets this all the time. You could see the frustration on her face. She profusely apologized several times.   Good food, just know what you are ordering."}
{"text":"The last time me and my husband came here it was amazing.. today I ordered the chiliqilles casserole and although it tasted great it was way too cheesy..  if you are gonna order this ask for less cheese.  The service and atmosphere are excellent.."}
{"text":"Matta's is BACK!  I'm pleased to announce that it's all very familiar. This tradition goes back to 1953. For me, it's been 20 years as a loyal patron. When the original building closed, I found out on my birthday (a personal tradition to eat here on my birthday) - I actually cried.   They were supposed to open the new location a year later, but it has been 3. Well, it was worth the wait.   The new building is gorgeous and huge. The food still tastes awesome. The margaritas are the same. The Salsa is the same. Even some of the staff is the same.  It was a long wait, but it was well worth it.   The new Matta's is located in the Mesa Riverview Mall that popped up out of nowhere and was overshadowed by Tempe Marketplace just a few blocks away.   They apparently had a soft opening last night and a large opening tonight. In spite of being a huge place, it was packed. Total chaos. We didn't quite get every item we ordered and a few items were different from what we ordered, but who would expect an opening night with a packed house to go perfectly smooth. And anyway, any mistakes were smoothed over and made up for.   Matta's is back and I'm going to be spending a lot of time here.   I still think this is the best Mexican food restaurant in the Valley. I love you, Matta's.   I will update this review after a few more visits. So far, so good."}
{"text":"After hearing people at work rave about Matta's I had to try it.  Met husband there about 430 pm on a Friday night.  The decor is beautiful! We both were impressed.    We were immediately served salsa and chips which were tasty.  I got a strawberry margarita which was half price for happy hour, but really small.  It was really good though! Husband got some kind of beer on tap. I also got a Diet Pepsi (no Coke products always upset me!)  We ordered a cheese crisp as an appetizer to share and again it was small! Most Mexican places bring them out on those huge silver plates that take up the whole table.  It tasted great though!  For entrees I got 3 cheese enchiladas and double rice with green sauce.  Let me say it's hard to find green sauce with no meat in it! The enchiladas were fabulous, the rice not so much!  It reminded me of those Rice A Roni cheater Mexican rices I make at home since I can't cook!  It was good, but I don't know if we will go back.  Overall, we prefer Arriba,"}
{"text":"This is an old school Mexican restaurant that was founded over 65 years ago and was originally located in downtown Mesa, AZ off of Main Street in between Stapley and Mesa Drive. I was in utero when I had my first taste of this place, as my mother craved it while pregnant (every time). I would always want to eat here for my birthday growing up. Although the restaurant has moved  and the family has a few break off restaurants, its hot sauce and chips remain my favorite on the planet. I also enjoy Gloria's chicken fajitas and their special sour cream that's spiked with some addictive drug (I think). This place is a true original in Arizona. For all of you diehard Mexican food lovers,this place deserves a try, on its legacy alone. I really enjoy their beans,rice and their green chili is delicious as well. I will say it once again, their hot sauce (runny hotter variety, not chunky) is my favorite hot sauce on the planet. I'm ridiculous when it comes to this stuff. I will actually buy a liter of it(Love the metric system we should switch) and use it on any and all Mexican food and several other items I eat. The drive to Mattas is about forty minutes from where I live, but for me, it's worth it."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food in Arizona!! The waiter recommended \"Sandusky special\" and it was amazing!! If you want great Mexican food, this is the place to come. I would drive out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"Service super slow.  My boyfriend ordered the chicken tortilla soup but they had to have brought him the enchilada soup.  It had good flavor but was not chicken tortilla.  I had the 4 mini burrito  (basucally chimi assortment) and they were all bland.  Too bad.  The building is nice inside and has a second level.  Just not overly impressed."}
{"text":"I fondly remember the original Matta's down on Main St.... Anyway, it was very slow around 1pm and no one seated me after 5 minutes of standing/waiting in the main dining area (several other frustrated patrons just left). I had a better experience once I moved to the \"cantina side\". The chips and salsa where well made but needed more kick. I did enjoy my taco and tostada combo with rice and beans."}
{"text":"Was not impressed and will not be back. First our waitress was an older woman who carted all of our food over on a cart. If she can't carry the food out maybe she should do something else in the restaurant. Felt bad to ask her for anything. She never refilled our chips and when we asked for a spicer salsa she said they had none! Really! Then my husband ordered a chicken burrito and it was stuffed with cream and my husband does not like creamy food. It did not state it on the menu. When we told the waitress about it she did nothing to fix his burrito. Will not be back!"}
{"text":"Our family has been going to Matta's since the early 90's and I can say they have changed a little since they closed the original location.  It's too bad that place had memory's and stories.  My sister loves this place and has carried three children into Matta's and the waitress from the original location got to see two of them grow.  So it's not only great food and fun but the staff and name are honest and true.  My favorites include Roberts tacos, chili relleno, and the hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, had to ask for everything. No chips offered, when I asked for chips no salsa or hot sauce was brought out. And it wasn't even busy. Never again."}
{"text":"Solid food. Really good fish tacos! Prices are wonderful and the staff was very nice. Our waitress was on point, always checking in on us and making sure we always had drinks. Never did we not have anything to drink. The chips came out almost as soon as we sat down, she took or drink order and about 8-10 minutes after we received our drinks; we ordered our food. The chips and salsa were absolutely delicious. Certainly not watery! We didn't really wait too long for the food to come to the table, I'd say 20 minutes at the max? There was 5 of us total. Our waitress was very friendly and hilarious! She definitely wasn't one that am hated her job, and just did it to do it. You could see she loved being there. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years and like the other reviewers have also said, I really miss the old location on Main Street.  The food was better then, however, it is still great food.  My personal favorites are the \"Sandy Special\", the \"Robert's Taco's, and the tamales.  I love the chips and salsa too.  I usually mix the mild and hot sauce together.  You do have to be careful with ordering because they put ground beef in many of their dishes so if you don't specify that you want shredded beef, you could end up with ground beef.  There is the most AMAZING Gelato for dessert called Gelato Dolce Vita in the little strip mall behind Mattas.  You won't want to pass that up!"}
{"text":"Matta's has a unique charm that keeps me coming back. I love that it's rich with history and has overcome so many obstacles to be serving food in Mesa again.   The service depends on who you get at your table, I've had amazing service and some pretty bad- but I always take it in stride. Nothing bad enough to keep me from coming back. As long as they keep the fresh chips and salsa coming, I'm happy.  Their dishes are simple Americanized Mexican food done right, complimented by inexpensive yet tasty margaritas. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming and they employees seem genuinely happy to be there. You can sometimes even catch a live Mariachi band performing upstairs!  It's a solid choice for dinner at Mesa Riverview, and worth the drive from another part of town."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE Mexican food restaurant. Awesome food the staff are always on point!! I never have had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"We were excited to try Matta's.  The atmosphere was fantastic!  Very beautiful interior with nice large comfy chairs.   We were seated quickly and a waiter promptly brought us a nice chip and salsa plate.  Our waitress greeted us and took our drink order as we looked at the menu.  I ordered the fajita salad and my husband ordered the combo dinner.  Our food arrived quickly and I was surprised to see that the fajita salad was served on a plate and not in a bowl or tortilla bowl.  The plate was seriously only half full, and of that the majority was bagged salad.  I was greatly disappointed to know that my $10 fajita salad consisted of half a bag of salad and a few (and I do mean few) pieces of \"fajitas\" thrown on top.  I was given ONE (yes, only one) flour tortilla in foil to enjoy with my bagged salad.   My husband's food was not very good either.   We are very disappointed.  :("}
{"text":"We didn't plan to go to Matta's for dinner this past Saturday evening, but when the lines were too long at some other nearby places, we decided to check out this new location, and are glad we did!  First, the atmosphere was terrific... understated Spanish-Colonial style... the wooden seats and tables are stately and very nice quality... we sat in a cozy booth that had arches and simple blue glass lighting... we could see there was upstairs seating which was more intimate... live mariachi music was playing in the background at a nice level not interfering with our conversation.  As for the food, it was typical Mexican items, and presented with fresh garnish (unlike the chains)... we had an appetizer, but skipped dessert.  This is a very nice place to take the family for dinner out, and also good for weekday lunches or dates... it scores on all levels... will have to check out the margaritas and desserts next time.  The only criticism I have was the not-so-warm greeting when we arrived and left... maybe the staff at this new location can work on improving that... same for the servers who seemed a bit quick to take our order and leave the table."}
{"text":"Food 4.75 stars. It's pretty darn good food. The enchilada is stuffed full of chicken (for the chicken one) and the rice and beans were pretty darn amazing. The quesadilla was simply amazing with a lil sour cream and guacamole. Couldn't even finish my combo plate it was such a big plate. Service is 5 stars, I have no complaints, the servers were very friendly. Price gets about 3 stars, it is a bit on the pricey side. But oh my gosh the chips and the salsa are simply delicious. Just the right amount of bite on the spicy one and full of flavor. Likely be back again."}
{"text":"Wow great food! We had the Roberts taco, potato tacos, enchilada, and Chile Relleno. Nice to get good Mexican food without me having to cook it!"}
{"text":"Matta's was a family tradition growing up in Mesa. We brought all of our out of town visitors to the Main Street location and were sad when it closed.   I was excited to bring my husband to this new location before going to the movies. We arrived for lunch around noon and took a table in the Cantina. I was a little surprised that the TVs were blaring talk shows instead of sports. About half the tables were empty but 5-6 older gentlemen (over 65) sitting at the bar looking bored. It felt less like a lunchtime escape than it did \"home sick watching TV\". The gentlemen seemed to leave quickly. I can't say I blamed them. 4 large screens with nothing interesting playing.   I wish I could say the food was as good as I remembered. The salsa was tasty but the flavor ended there.  The machaca beef was moist but incredibly bland and the flautas were teeth crackingly hard. The presentation on the plate was interesting, spring mix with carrot shavings. The fish taco my husband had was too chewy and had cabbage but no sauce.   Overall the staff was pleasant and the decor good. It was clean and welcoming, but the \"cantina\" was as exciting as a mid-day talk show and the food was so mild it was flavorless. I won't be back, so many tastier options for Mexican food in town."}
{"text":"Drove across town to dine in but when we arrived at the restaurant it had already closed. Online says it was open til 11pm and we arrived at 9:45pm. We called and were told that they closed early cause business was slow!!! The good is normally pretty good. They should have never relocated to current location."}
{"text":"I went here tonight with the BF and it was a fairly good experience. We had a coupon from the ASU coupon book for a free cheese crisp with any purchase... well the cheese crisp was good. I know, I know, it's hard to mess up a cheese crisp.... but we had a bad one a week or two ago... so this was a nice change. It was crispy, like it should be, and a fairly standard cheese crisp. We also got a chicken fajita burrito... this was good, there were red, orange, and yellow bell peppers in there and they tasted fairly fresh. It came with rice, and it was flavorful. This place is definitely americanized mexican food.... but it was good and I would come back."}
{"text":"Latest joint on Brak's \"AVOID\" list.  I should have known - seeing the word \"bland\" about 3 times when skimming reviews should have been a huge red flag.  We had a fairly long wait on a Saturday evening before finally getting seated.  The service was slow and inattentive.  The food was overpriced.  I had fajitas, and it was WAY low on meat (chicken) compared to the other ingredients, despite the high price, and was bland as hell.  Your basic chain restaurant serves far better fajitas than this crud, for less.  Add in the wait time and glacial service, and this place was a huge disappointment.  You've been forewarned."}
{"text":"Can't beat a place like this. Mom and Pop joint that has great service and AWESOME food. We stopped in on Mother's Day and got there right when they opened. Got a table right away and enjoyed ourselves a bunch. Stop by and check this great Mexican food place out. Thank you"}
{"text":"Cutting straight to the chase, the Spanish soup is AMAZING!   So one summer afternoon my friend and I decided to go to Bass Pro shop to check it out. After we were done there we looked around Mesa Riverview for a place to each lunch. Not being familiar with the area, I turned to Yelp to see what was around and found Matta's. Me being a vegan, it probably wasn't the best place to go as everything (except the Spanish soup) has dairy. The waitress wasn't really that helpful in telling me what items I could pick from. All she said was, \"this probably isn't the right place for you.\" Kind of a rude comment...especially since there's only 1 item on the menu. Anyway, I will say that the Spanish soup was delicious and I would go back just for it."}
{"text":"Really interesting sitting on the upper level. My wife and I were able to celebrate a birthday here and we really liked our food.  Went with some friends who are not the most adventurous and they also enjoyed their food.   I wasn't a huge fan of the green chile pork but I did enjoy others. Fajitas were very good. The spices were just right. The salsa and chips very filling.  I love a good mariachi and we were definitely serenaded.   Overall great atmosphere and a lot of good experiences in the past."}
{"text":"We were in the area looking for a place to eat, food was very good and we tried a lot of different things, Nachos, sandy's special, flautas, stuffed steak quesadilla.  All of it excellent. Service was hit or miss but I would certainly go back."}
{"text":"We went in when nobody was there waited longer than any other table that was there after us. The server brought the food out wrong then told me i was wrong about the menu.  Spoke to the manager she told me the server was wrong boxed the food up for me. She asked if she could do anything else for us and we asked for refills on drinks. She must have forgotten us just like our server. I don't think she was a manager, she sure didn't act like it!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of things that keep me coming back to Matta's.  For one thing, I've been eating there since I was 3 years old, and have a special place in my heart for their spanish rice, homemade chips (usually served warm) and delicious salsas, both hot and mild.  I've been scorching my tongue on Matta's salsa for as long as I can remember, and the food hasn't changed in the thirty two years I have been frequenting it, whether at their old location in Downtown Mesa (now closed) or their newly opened Matta's Grill and Cantina.  My wife and mother both swear by the Chile Relleno, my wife also loves their Albondigas soup.  I'm a huge fan of their tacos, both hard and soft, as well as their other stereotypical mexican restaurant fare.  I also love that their staff has largely remained the same, with many of them having worked for the Matta family for twenty years or more.  That says something to me about them as a business, that their employees stay for so long.  So go to Matta's, enjoy the Friday Night Mariachi.  Have some drinks and don't skip the rice."}
{"text":"Whoa.. After a long HARD day we wanted somewhere relaxing to go; this was the wrong choice. Awful service with attitude, even offering for us to \"make our own drinks\".  The ambiance was nice and the patio was a nice setting but the service was the deciding factor on if we would ever return and I can say we will not RETURN!  Customer service is of the utmost importance in a successful business and I'm sorry but you have Failed!"}
{"text":"WhatsaMATTA wit chu?!?  Had to write that... Now, on to business.   I have absolutely no complaints about Mattas. Was on my way to grab a matinee viewing of a movie at Cinemark and this restaurant could not be any more convenient.   There's a slight price reduction for 'happy hour' on the combos. $1,$2, and $3 for combos 1,2, and 3, respectfully.  I got the 2 combo with my choice of cheese enchilada and pork tamales. The cheese had amazing oooey-gooeyiness. The pork tamales was done well but it is spicy. If you don't like spicy, I would not get this.  The portions were huge and the food came out right away. There were chips and salsa while I waited (2 different salsas... I liked the chunky one!).   Very standard Mexican preparation.  I would very much like to return to this fine establishment!"}
{"text":"this is my husband's family favorite Mexican restaurant for almost 3 decades...I've been here many times, and they  always don't fail in making our hungry tummy happy! haha  Their food is yummy and we have this lady Milena, our server , is the family's oft requested waitress ever since. So she's been there since they started loving this place. She is wonderful and so sweet and like a family already. I wish I took picture with her too. My mother in law says it's more of a nostalgic thing that's why they love going back to this place, because of the many sweet memories they have shared  from dining here all these years.  I like the ambiance and the interiors, makes me feel like I'm in the old days. Service, food and the ambiance are great! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"So the last time I ate here (albeit the old location on Main Street) was in the late 70s.  I had the green pork chimi today.  Overall it wasn't bad but everything, and I mean everything, lacked seasoning.  As such everything was slightly bland in taste.  Also this is one of those places that puts a quarter head of lettuce on the plate.  Not sure why that happens since I expect few people ever eat it.  As I said above its been more than 35 years since I've been here.  I expect it will be some time before I return."}
{"text":"Yum! I've been a fan of Matta's for almost 25 years.  I have to eat here every time I come to AZ (I used to go to the original location)."}
