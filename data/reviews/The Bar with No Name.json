{"text":"The Bar with No Name recently opened up in the place where the ever-empty Z-Bar used to be, and the signs of them still working out the kinks of being a newly opened place are still there. It was fairly obvious that the space was still in the process of being turned into something else, and there was still a lot of remenants of Z-Bar to be found. I've been to Z-Bar once, and I couldn't really tell the difference between the two, except for the kick-ass, inviting new Bar With No Name sign out front.  Simply put, No Name's staff are amazing, thoughtful, and exactly how food biz staff shoudl be. They were really concerned with making sure we had a good time, and because of them, our experience was good. Even though the place was busy, they still made time to chat with us and didnt make us feel rushed.  No Name's food menu was the standard bar fare. Burgers, wings, and fried foods were front and center, but despite the plainness of the menu, the food was hot, fresh, and served the way it should be.  The music in this place, however, really needs some improvements. We probably would have stayed for another drink if it wasn't for commercials blasted over the radio being the only form of entertainment. I asked if they could put some sattelite radio on, and I was told not to worry because a DJ was going to be playing soon. I left at 1030, and I never saw or heard a DJ, just Leon's, Loblaw's, and car commercials at full volume.  It does seem as though they rushed to open, and they probably could have used another week or two to get things together, but once they get it all worked out, this place stands a great chance at becoming the perfect neighbourhood hangout.  *We plan to review again in two months."}
{"text":"As other have mentioned, the service here is terrific. Absolutely in love with their burgers. You won't find lower prices for beer in the area, especially when they have specials on early in the week."}
{"text":"One of the loveliest dive bars in t.o -- my gf and I frequent this spot for cheap craft beers, cheap handmade fresh food, always kind service and a chill non pretentious atmosphere. You feel at home in this place"}
{"text":"I've walked by this bar a million times and thought it looked quite sketchy, the random bar with no name, located next to the Bang Bang Bar. However, it is actually quite cute and quaint inside. Shocking! The servers were all also very friendly and attentive.   They serve food all night, and have a wide list of beers on tap that are mostly local, like Big Wheel, Mill St Organic, etc. They also sell Grasshopper and other Big Rock beers. The pints and pitchers are very cheap - about $4 for drinks, $12.75 for pitchers. I will most definitely return."}
{"text":"Cool, friendly owner - check. Cool, friendly staff - check. Good food - check. Great selection of craft beer - check.  Must be noted the owner is a huge geek and if you're looking to relive a part of your childhood / early-adolescence over board games, video games and debates about Star Wars, Marvel comics and Transfomers while drinking, this is the spot.  Only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because too much stock goes unreplenished and for reasons beyond my comprehension, it takes and eternity for their fries to get served, which is weird since you'd figure that nothing on a menu gets served up faster than fries.  Still, awesome joint."}
{"text":"This place has really grown on me since my first review. Make no mistake, it isn't a high-brow bar, it feels more like one's living room instead. The main night time bartender, Patrick, is great and really makes this a welcoming place. He is also one of the bar's owners.   Two big pluses for this bar:  1) The beer is value priced and is local craft brewed from breweries such as: Mill St, Steamwhistle, King, and Flying Monkees. 2) Super-friendly staff.  It seems like a living room or basement rec-room because Wednesday evenings they have video and board game competitions.  The sitting area is relatively small during the months that the large backyard patio isn't open.  The food is good, and they now have a printed menu. It is a rather limited selection, but I do highly recommend their burger.  If you like \"Hole in the wall\" atmosphere, cramped quarters, and craft beer, then I think this is a place people will generally like, quite probably a lot."}
{"text":"As soon as I saw that this bar was called \"the bar with no name,\" I knew I was going have a good time. And I did, each time I visited!  Very close to Dundas west subway station, this bar is located in a very unpretentious (aka boring) strip on Bloor st. Interiors are minimalist but cozy and I really like that when all I am looking for is to hang out with friends for a drink and bar food.   Their  kitchen is quite innovative and besides the usual bar fare they have some interesting adds. Throughout the week there are some kind of specials. There is a lounging area (not too big) in front of the bar where you have people playing video games, watching some sports event or live music.  Secret tip: Ask for their special spicy jerk sauce on the side. This dressing is meant for a particular item on their menu but it is really good and you have to try it.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"PRICE: Great.   Ten dollar pitchers: Monday all day. Wed: until 9.  Including Cobblestone. So that's good.  Patio: Dirty. Looks like an abandoned trailer park or something. Unfortunately no sun in the back afternoon because of the high building to the West.  The front patio is better - but not much room (three tables).  Service: Friendly and welcoming. Told us about specials later in the week.  The cook still wasn't there around 6:30pm - which was unfortunate because I wanted a burger - had one earlier in the month and it was pretty decent.   Not a bad spot for a drink around Dundas/Keele."}
{"text":"been here twice now - neat little spot. 10 dollar pitchers of awesome local beer on mon-weds.   the food is ok. do not, under any circumstances, order the \"jerk burger.\" tasted like an overcooked patty with half a can of mr goudas jerk powder poured on top. completely revolting, and quite painful to eat actually.  one poor server (very nice fellow) and one poor sod in the kitchen for a pretty full bar (both front and back patios were full) led to some pretty heinously slow service time. if you're the owner reading this, get another guy on the floor and everyone has a better time.  overall a nice little spot with a good selection on tap."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure I could write an unbiased review for this bar since I am friends with some of the people that work there so I'll keep it brief. I think the people are what makes this place great! Awesome staff.  Last time I was here they had live music -- fun times ! There isn't too much to the interior, but there's a lot of space to hangout and as I mentioned the staff are very friendly and attentive.  Definitely order some food if you stop in here ! Pretty good deals on drinks throughout the week."}
{"text":"$10 pitchers on Monday and Wednesday.  Very friendly and laid-back servers at this bar, very relaxing environment. Importantly, the crowd is a younger one... Not sketchy or drab. Great little place in the West end! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great little joint. Fantastic food. One of the best chicken club sandwiches around. Small patio out back great for sunny days."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. It's very salt to the earth kind of vibe. It's not flashy or fancy, just very comfortable atmosphere where you feel you can go and not be judged, and be able to completely relax. Not to mention the deals are amazing! My two pints came to  about 10 bucks... What a deal for nowadays!! It's just really a chill environment to the core even when me and my friend walked in they gave is free onion rings and wings tasters if we wanted. It's pretty small so it can be cozy at times and hard to grab a spot... But we were pretty lucky and got seats by there open front widow which kind of opens like a garage door type of look which is neat.. definitely going to go back here soon since it's just a short walk from keele subway and totally worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Cool spot, and always fun with a group of people on the back patio.  I avoid the fifth star because sometimes they overcook a burger. Beer and everything else is always great"}
{"text":"Great bar with a rad beer selection and super affordable set of meal options. Given how expensive its neighbours can be (thinking of The Wicket, or even The Mugshot further down Bloor), these folks offer a solid vibe and price point for people looking for a pint and/or a bite.   It's also maybe the friendliest bar on this stretch of Bloor.  I did notice they had a LGBTQ triangle on the window for awhile but it appears to have disappeared. Not sure why, as it only further contributed to how welcoming this place can be"}
{"text":"The beer was excellent (blueberry lager) and they have a huge selection to chose from. But even better than the drinks was the service. The staff here are some of the most kind and friendly in the city. They make you feel welcomed and comfortable no matter what. Great vibes, good music- would definitely recommend a visit to this bar, and will absolutely be going back"}
{"text":"Bar Checklist:  Good local beer +  Great prices +  Patio +  Friendly atmosphere +   The \"Bar with No Name\" comes out ++++"}
{"text":"Bar with No Name will always be one of my favourite spots to go to in Toronto. It has a lovely atmosphere, the staff are as friendly as can be, and the food+drinks are great price! Monday's and Wednesday's are $12 pitchers with plenty of craft beer to choose from. The food is great! My favourites are their nachos, nacho poutine, fries, and the spicy buffalo poutine, yum! I love their patio in the back and there is always plenty of fun board games to play as well as a video game system inside. Pretty cool place if you ask me :)"}
{"text":"Great little dive bar in an area where they just don't exist! The food is good and cheap, more than ample seating on the back patio. Board games galore if that's your thing.  Great craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"Everything is so cheap at this place. Thursday has $3.75 tall boys (and there are specials every day of the week)!!!   The food is nothing special, but it is your average bar stock food that is good with the very cheap beer.   Our waitress was very attentive (but not overbearing), friendly and very knowledgeable. The place has a grunge kind of feel, in a very comfortable and familiar way.  I will definitely be coming back!!!!!"}
{"text":"The owner of this bar is extremely kind and you can tell he really cares about his customers as it could be an episode of cheers as he seems to know most of the people who walks through the doors name :)   They do you have a game night where people play games those nights are actually quite busy and well attended  I didn't actually drink but my friends said their cocktail menu was good and that they had a good selection beer on tap and bottle  They also do you have a small patio. Everyone who works there is engaging and enjoys their job. I definitely would return it was a nice night out thank you"}
{"text":"A relatively new place with a friendly staff and some great beers on tap (Hoptical Illusion!!!). Not mind blowing, not spectacular, just a good neighbourhood bar that I would be at a lot more often than once every few months if they were closer to home.   Bonus: changed the channel on the big TV from hockey that nobody was watching to Gremlins for me. GREMINS!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place over three years ago and still enjoy it... It's gotten a lot better after two management changes... The food now is great and they have specials during the week...  Summer are awesome here as they have a big patio to accommodate a lot of people...   Great to hang out at catch up with friends..."}
{"text":"The beer prices are great! and I like having the beer choices all IPA's. More bars could take notes on this place that you don't need Molson Canadian and 50 on tap to have a successful bar. I got the nachos and they were...well they were nachos, nothing crazy and got a good portion for the price. The seating and atmosphere are pretty tight and dark, its a little uncomfortable to sit and the bar locals can get a little \"rowdy\" as the night goes on. The staff are nice and the owner is a cool guy. Advice: go for a beer but don't stay too long."}
