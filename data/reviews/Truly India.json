{"text":"Great authentic Indian food, fast service due to the buffet style setup yet still a good selection of curries and veggies. Friendly owners and reasonable prices makes this a favourite."}
{"text":"Had been longing to try this restaurant.  Went with a friend for dinner and was SO  disappointed.  I did not expect dinner service to be on a polystyrene tray with plastic cutlery.  But I did like the food samples to try.  As another reviewer mentioned, I did not enjoy any of the spices; also the food was not very hot.  Upon eating dessert, I suddenly found myself crunching on a large piece of hard, jagged and sharp plastic.  I brought it to the attention of the server who looked at it and said 'Oh it is just a piece of broken plastic container!'  I looked at her incredulously, because the unspoken part of her sentence was 'so no big deal!'  I asked her if I could have a second dessert to take home.  She told me 'sure' and went away, only to come back with a plastic container of dessert, which she handed to me and walked away.  There was no apology or concern expressed whatsoever.  As I paid my bill, I said to the other server,'were you told that I found plastic in my dessert?'  She responded that she had and then charged me full price for the meal.  At the very least they could have comped my dessert.  Sadly, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Just got our dinner order delivered. HORRIBLE!! It would take a lot for me to say that, but not only was it not like any other Indian food I've eaten, but it was terrible-tasting.  Tooo salty. I could only eat the bread, and unfortunately our $40 order is going to have to go to trash.  So upsetting."}
{"text":"I've been to hundreds of Indian restaurants in the past 40 years through the world. This was by far the worst.  The bharta was ok but the dry curries smelled and tasted like a barn and as if they'd been sitting on the stovetop for 5 days.   Neither my guests nor I could eat the food. It was very stale and I questioned its safety since it tasted so old and arrived lukewarm. I've had bacillus cereus from improperly handled Indian food and took charcoal to keep from potentially getting ill again.   Please go to or order from Bindia if you want Indian. There's a reason this place is so inexpensive."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here.  My fault.  I should have as always done it through tasteaway.com and gotten the extra 20% they were offering but mainly because when i was given sh.t food I had some recourse.  Min delivery $30 AND a $4 delivery charge.   Don't expect too much and you might be fine.  Prices are pretty good for a lot of items but some are ridiculous like chaat papdi was a rip off price-wise but to top it up the dish itself was horriiiibbbbllleee and not even papdi as it is supposed to be.  I found this place to be very unprofessional and would go there under desperate conditions only.  Mithai was pretty good.  Parathas were awful.  Naan- awful (again not what is is supposed to be at all).  The overall taste is authentic which is a good thing, so when desperate for cheap Indian food I might still order here.  I think once you figure out some of their good items, you might be okay."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Tastey and inexpensive. Fresh, well seasoned, and very flavourful. Didn't need heat.  The eggplant was soo good."}
