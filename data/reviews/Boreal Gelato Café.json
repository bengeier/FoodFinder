{"text":"You know, it's been two years since my first review of this place, and often, places start strong and then fizzle a little, sometimes I expect that quality will go down, or the atmosphere might change. Not this place.

I straight up love Boreal Gelato. They have vegan-friendly gelato in interesting flavours, today they had chocolate, salted caramel, and coconut. Fruit based  sorbettos are great and all, but these were extra exceptional, creamy, rich, and just all around delicious. 

I know flavours rotate, but I haven't yet tried any flavour of their non-dairy gelatos that wasn't tasty.

There is ample seating, inside and a little area outside to sit on, service was quick and friendly, 

Go there."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly, prompt staff, free wifi, and good coffee."}
{"text":"Aside from the server with the 'deer in the headlights' approach to customer service, our trip to Boreal was great. 

An eclectic little hangout nestled in Parkdale Village, Boreal boasts handmade traditional and vegan gelato. Warning: not a huge selection here but the lack of options is compensated for in flavour and authenticity.

My Root Beer Gelato was perfect and reminiscent of a classy childhood root beer float: high on taste and perfectly creamy. Pistachio is my top gelato, and at Boreal, they get it right: naturally soft green with real pistachio flavour.

Happy to see vegan choices on the menu, prepared with almond milk; a great effort but missing the mark somewhat. The Salted Caramel is dense, super sweet, and far too concentrated in flavour. Imagine melting a handful of Werther's candy and serving that as gelato. The Chocolate is intense on the palette and will cater to those who prefer dark chocolate at a high percentage.

The portions are generous and reasonable with select additional toppings available. Worth the visit to a bustling part of town if you want to have real handmade gelato."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food! So many great options for intolerant folks like me! This was my first chocolate \"icecream\" (i think it was made with almond milk) in almost 10 years! I was really happy they allowed me to work on my laptop there. This beats starbucks. I can get great food and drinks while I work or relax.

I think my favourite part of service was that they were playing the Donnie Darko soundtrack and Charmed theme song today! :) Thanks Boreal Gelato!! 

PS: Very clean washrooms too! That's always a bonus."}
{"text":"I tried the Balsam Fir gelato and lemon olive oil gelato. K had the pistachio gelato and salted caramel gelato. 

The balsam fir gelato was really subtle and quite nice. I wouldn't at all describe it as woody. I wouldn't mind haven't seconds of it either.
The lemon olive oil gelato had great flavour. The lemon was quite bright and refreshing.

Pistachio was good too but I prefer Ed's Real scoop better. 
Salted caramel was intensely flavoured!

Definitely a great addition to Parkdale and my goto place in the west end."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Best gelato in town.  Melanie is awesome.
We had lunch and the pumpkin soup and macaroni was best in the city!"}
{"text":"Eggs Hemingway-- Benedict on a hard, heavy biscuit. Too hard too heavy. Egged cooked perfectly, hollandaise unforgivably separated, smoked salmon no complaints. $2.50 for an extra Rosti, which was dry, unseasoned and not worth $2.50. Should learn to make hollandaise if they want to feature the bennies so prominently on the menu.

Double espresso was an americano... Charged me $3 per shot and it was watery.

Ordered a scone and it came dry and slightly burnt on a naked plate. No butter, no preserves, nothing.

Over promised and under delivered would not recommend to a friend.

Serves me right for eating this on Passover!

Homemade ketchup is great, as is their hot sauce."}
{"text":"All amazing hand made gelato. They change up the flavours all the time.  My fave right now is the earl grey.  It's really milky and has the perfect hint of tea. If they have it try the balsam pine flavour! Really smooth not like eating a tree. Pistachio is classic and pineapple is really refreshing."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but just couldn't. I was so excited to try the gelato latte but to my disappointment it was such a letdown. Based of the server's recommendation i paired my latte with the hazelnut gelato. It tasted like a regular non-sweetened latte, i kept drinking hoping that all the flavours sunk to the bottom, but was sadly greeted with soggy cookie crumbs? Turns out the hazelnut gelato is not pure hazelnut, it was mixed with cookie crumbs or chocolate chip cookie - can't remember.

Anyways gave it another shot and got pistachio gelato.. I've had the ones in Europe and those were amazing, came back to Toronto and had amazing pistachio gelato at La Paloma... this place has really disappointing pistachio gelato - it tasted like toasted almonds (nothing wrong with that, but if i wanted toasted almond gelato i would have ordered it).

Anyways two thumbs down for me. Plus prices were too high to justify the quality and taste."}
{"text":"The gelato is great. The food is good. The coffee is fine. The ambiance is nice. The washrooms are clean. 

The staff are horrid.

Well, mostly. There is one nice one. My apologies to her.

My boyfriend loved this place because of some of its great qualities, but they were so consistently and blatantly rude to him that he just stopped going.

I totally picked up on what he was talking about (because it was impossible not to) but didn't fully get it until today, when I went on my own and watched a whole line of people before me get treated with extreme contempt. It was painful, and frankly, I'm embarrassed for them. I was a tad nervous as I approached the counter, but ended up just feeling sorry for them because:

1. It was BRUTALLY hot in there. Nobody could maintain sanity for more than 15 minutes in that torture chamber.

2. If nearly the whole roster of employees acts similarly morose and rude - what is the real problem?

3. Like I said, embarrassing.

Anywho, they aren't my first choice anymore but I'll probably be back someday...their gelato is just so good...
Sigh."}
{"text":"Between the Gladestone and Parts & Labour, I used to think my lunch and brunch options were limited to the Mascot and Skyline Diner, but this Sunday I saw a sidewalk sign advertising brunch outside a shop I, frankly, never would have noticed otherwise. 

Boreal Gelato Company (perhaps an unfortunate name during Canadian winter*) serves an amazing and affordable brunch featuring items such as a bread basket brimming with freshly baked almond, chive & cheddar scones, croissants, whipped butter and in-house preserves ($6.00), classic Eggs Benedict with either back bacon, spinach or smoked salmon ($10.00), omlettes ($7-10), waffles ($8.00), blueberry pancakes ($8.00), AND THE BEST FRENCH TOAST I'VE HAD IN TORONTO TO DATE ($8.00).

We ordered the savory scones (4 for $6.00 with preserves and butter), Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon ($11.00), the French Toast ($8.00) with a side of fried chirizo ($2.00) and two fair trade coffees ($2.00 each).  With tax and tip $39.00 for two.

Food notes:  The savour scones are baked fresh every day and rival the crumb of the infamous Drake Blueberry Scones though no as rich.  The hollondaise on the Eggs Benedict was light and full of citrus and not at all the clumpy re-heated horror that Anthony Bordain warns against ever ordering. The Eggs Benedict comes atop a freshly baked biscuit and is sided by a potato rosti and a nicely dressed side salad of baby spinach and grape tomatoes.  The chef also makes ketchup from scratch so be sure to try some on your rosti (the flavours are tomato chutney, but the consistency is ketchupy.) 

The highlight of the meal was absolutely the french toast.  Three thick pieces of egg soaked Challah browned perfectly and served with spiced caramelized bananas (we wish there were a few more pieces on top), with a generous side of fresh pineapple and raspberries (so much better than melon), and a side BOWL of vanilla whipped cream with candied oranges.  We devoured this by dipping each piece of sturdy (and not at all soggy) french toast already dripping with real maple syrup (complimentary) into the bowl of whipped cream... and somehow still it wasn't overly sweet.  I am a savory over sweet girl, and I couldn't get enough of this plate.  

We finished the meal with samples of the various gelatos and will definitely be back in summer to eat a full serving of the Lemon & Olive Oil Sobretto and the Salted Caramel Gelato.

The service was superb, Mel, the chef, was happy to answer my questions and show me the gelato machine (lust!), and the restaurant was clean, bright and warm.

Note:  everything is made in-house, there is vegan salted caramel and vegan chocolate gelato made with almond milk, and the joint offers free wifi.

*The Owner did mention she is thinking of changing the name because its hard for an ice cream shop in winter... we think the sidewalk sign is enough to get people inside in winter.  Instead, I'd recommend a more design conscious front window sign because until this weekend when I walked by I always thought this was some kind of non-profit art gallery."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  How can the Root Beer gelato be so real as if you are drinking the root beer.  I mix it with the Pastachios but the taste is too light.  

You can mix as many as possible of flavours in your order so long as you still can figure out what you are eating.

Feel free to sit wherever you can find a spot."}
{"text":"Evidently a hotspot for 30-something young mothers, small children ran amok through the place when i popped in on a Saturday afternoon. Regardless, i knew i was in a legit Gelaterie upon reaching the counter--what a relief to not see heaping stacks of neon frothy ice cream masquerading as gelato. I tried the salted caramel and a banana cookie concoction, both of which were scrumptious--particularly the latter--although they seemed a little too sugary than i would have liked. Still, worth coming back and trying even more flavours!"}
{"text":"I'm sold !!! Excellent quality gelatos, and great service too. And I think I'll go back and grab one of those gelato pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving dinner......Nice job !!"}
{"text":"Haven't tried the gelato....but they've surprisingly got a very solid brunch line-up. 

There were eggs benny, rostis, blueberry pancakes, french toast, and I had some vegan chilli. It was spicy and beany (but no meat). Very good, very good! Also, I think it was only 6$. Oh, Also again, they have fresh squeezed grapefruit juice here! You know what that means."}
{"text":"Great gelato and cozy atmosphere. Really enjoy their gelato latte's and their gelato sandwiches. The staff are super friendly as well. Plus they are always creating unique flavours. Would recommend this place for a date night or a regular coffee hang out. :)"}
{"text":"While waiting for a table at Grand Electric, this gelato shop was the perfect spot to wait!  ..Well, if you want to start with dessert.

It's a small and welcoming shop with a small but unique selection of gelato, sorbet, and baked goods (vegan brownies too).  The menu has brunch and lunch items, but it looked a lot more like a dessert stop rather than a restaurant (around 6pm).

I have to give Boreal Gelato extra snaps for their uber-awesome Canadian logo.  They have made-in-Canada gelato and their logo is a picture of an Inuksuk holding an ice cream cone.  Too cute.  Yay, Canada!

The gelato flavours were original and interesting:
* Lemon olive oil sorbet
* Spicy rosemary shortbread

I had a salted caramel milkshake ($4 small/$6 large), which can be made with almond milk!  It was pretty good,  not very thick, but still tasty.

This is a great place for a cool treat, fair-trade coffee, and a quick vegan-friendly snack."}
{"text":"I can only speak to the Boreal and Ontario Peach gelato...but as to them, SO TASTY.  The boreal may be the most uniquely delicious sweet treat I've ever had the pleasure of consuming...sweet cream with just a coniferous hint.  The Ontario peach was bursting with fresh peach flavour.  Even the cones - locally made - are delicious.  And to top it off...a very healthy scoop for the price!  Love this Parkdale spot!"}
{"text":"Quaint quiet place by Parkdale. Love their selection of vegan ice cream and regular ice cream. Always get their rootbeer ice cream whenever available and also love their sorbets."}
{"text":"This place is on the west end of the city, an area I have only recently started to explore. Despite the good reviews I would say give it a pass as there is a lot better stuff nearby at almost the same price point. 
The setup is simple and too the point with a bunch of stuff thrown around to diversify their offerings. 
On to the main event I tastes the salted caramel and pistachio and settled with the later. While decent I would say its nothing special and falls somewhere a tad better than your mundane grocery store bought version. 
I would say skip and try something nearby for a more fulfilling experience."}
{"text":"The vegan options are appreciated. I'm not a huge fan of the general flavours but they are all good to try once. 
They sell artist and handcrafted items as well. 
I think the interior could be designed better (I know that's a loose term but take it as simple as that)."}
{"text":"Nice parkdale spot. Great for summertime which is it's peak busyness as is typical for all ice cream parlours or gelato joints. Good selection of flavours And I like how they have many sizing options for reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Fantastic gelato place in a vibrant community. Lots of great and unique flavours. I get salted caramel every time, usually with another flavour or two. You can get as many flavours as you want with any of the sizes. The gelato is very fresh and the cones (vegan waffle cones) are crispy and delicious. The prices are a bit steep, I find, but you do get what you pay for."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. 

My husband and I got an order of gelato each: chocolate and salty peanut butter. For a small cup it was about $4.50 so we expected it to be good. We rate our treats 2.5 out of 5 - didn't enjoy it and I threw out half of mine. 

Really, for the price it should be amazing or the sizes should be increased. I don't get the hype...they had posted recommendations from different magazines in the window."}
{"text":"This place is no longer creepy as I mentioned in my last review! Our server was such a kind and warm lady. The place no longer had a musty smell. 

I ordered the chocolate chip cookie and the brownie and holy $@&@&*# it was sooooo good! 

How is it vegan and gf?!?! How? How? How? It blows my mind! 
And of course, I couldn't leave without the vegan salted caramel and cantaloupe gelato."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go after eating at Doomies! The flavours of ice cream here are delicious and varied, and I love that they have vegan options!!!"}
{"text":"It was so freezing cold today, but I absolutely love a good vegan gelato whenever, wherever. Ever since G is for Gelato shut down lately I've been searching for an equally good gelato place, preferably one that carries a vegan pistachio flavour on par with G, to fill the void. Unfortunately the void was not filled today - the vegan flavours here are not as smooth or creamy as the ones at G. There were decently sized ice shavings in my chocolate flavour... I should've just ordered a bingsu jk. For the kids size you pay $3.50 for 2 flavours, but I recommend getting the next size up, the small, since it's a full cup rather than half and you get unlimited choice of flavours. There are 4 vegan flavours here and a few sorbets - the chocolate is the least sweet and I liked it even though it is very generic. The pistachio flavour was good, but not as creamy as I would've liked and a tad too sweet. 

Also, they have an entire vegan lunch and weekend brunch menu! Reasonably priced.

Ps. Check out my new and improved Yelp food photography!!! Yay iPhone X :)"}
{"text":"Cute little gelato shop tucked in amongst indie clothing stores and other Toronto-based establishments. The vegan chocolate gelato was delicious!"}
{"text":"Boreal Gelato is as surprising (which artisan flavours will they have this time?) as it is reliable: delicious, creamy gelato that gets it right. This is a lovely shop and I've been meaning to return to try their brunch and coffee, but I seem to have a hard time moving past the gelato itself! 

I'm a sucker for chocolate (boring I know!) and this is my favourite scoop here, but I also love the coffee and the french vanilla (it's actually better than vanilla froyo, which I didn't think was possible!) and next time I absolutely must try the pistachio, having read such rave reviews from my fellow yelpers! It's not my favourite mango though. No one does mango better than Mad Italian. 

You really can't go wrong at Boreal and if you can't decide have no fear, you can get as many flavours as your heart desires (and yes, people have gotten ALL the flavours in the past. I had to ask!). There's always something for everyone - including the vegans - and flavours such as root beer and balsamic keep things consistently fresh and interesting."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been here twice and had after dinner tea and dessert as well as lunch.

The gelato espresso latte is awesome. The sandwiches are great. It would be good if they added a side salad with the sandwich, but overall, the food is good. The prices are reasonable. They have vegan, soy, and lactose free products and they taste good!"}
{"text":"Gelato felt too sweet and flavours didn't feel so unique. Wasn't too impressed by the gelato. Not sure if I'd go back :/"}
{"text":"My favourite gelato in the city. Always fresh with some great flavours. I ordered the vanilla earl grey and it was soooooo delicious! They have vegan options as well. So if you're out for dinner def get dessert here!"}
{"text":"Nothing but good things to say about this place. The coconut ice cream was delicious and throughly satisfying."}
{"text":"Dropped by here after dinner on a cold day for some gelato for dessert. 

The inside of the cafe was actually very warm and cozy with a good amount of seating space and even 2 couches at the corner. The benches along the wall was very interesting because it reminded me of the benches at church. The cafe definitely had a lot of character from its decor and there was even a shelf near the door that displayed some interesting items for sale. 

In terms of gelato, Boreal had a good amount selection of gelato, around 10 flavours I believe, which was slightly fewer than the other gelato places that I've be to. However, unique to other gelato shops, Boreal allows you to pick as many flavours as you want as long as they fit in the cup. This is perfect for gelato fanatics like me, because I often struggle to pick between many delicious flavours, and here they let you have them all!!!"}
{"text":"The new flavours are fantastic - pumkin, lots of fruits, and the best maple walnut the world has ever tasted (I am quite partial to maple walnut - a big fan and this is the best!) - the best!

I hear there is a new brunch menu coming out for the weekends too."}
{"text":"Funny thing is that we didn't try the gelato; however, their coffee is excellent - fair trade of course. Had a vegan brownie which was pretty good - you must try their burnt caramel sauce, it's really good! Everything is so natural and eco-friendly here! I was especially amazed at the vegan waffle cones. Great service and open late!"}
{"text":"This place is a conscious about the environment as they are about making fresh artisinal batches of gelato. The growth I have witnessed in the last couple of years has been amazing.  On top of the new flavours there are always standard ones, but my favourites hands down are the nut flavours.  The pistachio is beyond divine and well worth getting more than one scoop of it!   Do not be afraid to try flavours till you find one you like.  They are always making new flavours, the rosemary shortbread and pepper flake was truly enjoyable and the balsam fir was interesting on the palate.  They take the best of what is in season and suspend it in a creamy form which melts on your tongue.  The takeout containers are biodegradable which is an added bonus because we all have carbon footprints we must be mindful of. 

If you have a favourite flavour they are usually available to take home as well as order into a cake.  I have yet to stop by for brunch as I am beyond infatuated with the gelato.  I encourage you to walk on by and have a scoop or two...or three....or a half litre!"}
{"text":"They let you try he flavors you want, u like some other places just simply tell you what they are. Prices are just amazing for its quality. What makes It deserves a 5 star is because of their service, everything else comes after in my opinion. 

Love it & will visit again"}
{"text":"Have you ever tried pine-infused gelato? Neither have I - until I visited Boreal Gelato!  I've got to hand it to them with the creative flavors - that will keep the parents coming back for more alongside the kids. I also tried their pistachio gelato, which was tasty. Definitely make this a destination if you're heading down to the area in summertime."}
{"text":"Lol yes yes I did have cold treat twice in one day! 

What can I say!! I like the adventure ! Haha 

Well this place really caught our eye because it was vegan gelato, I mean of course I have to try this. I had the cantaloupe sherbet(I'm pretty sure I was going for a theme that day, FRESH FRUITS), it was very refreshing after the meal I had at guu's, which was right beside it. 

I had a taste of the salted caramel, which was rich and creamy, quite good if you ask me. 

The atmosphere remind me of camp. Almost like your in a cabin or something, really cool to see a shop like that when your in the city. 

Only thing was , there was a oder to the shop, and maybe it was only for that day, which I hope because the smell was not pleasant. I would have loved to sit and enjoy the shop and its features, but we were in and out."}
{"text":"Being from out of Toronto, it's hard finding good spots that you'll make the effort to go back to. But this place... I seriously cannot get over how amazing the gelato (made in-house/organic and with vegan options) is! I just can't. I was here about a year ago and found myself back. The salted caramel, chocolate and pistachio flavours are amazing, highly recommend those ones!"}
{"text":"What a come out of nowhere star! I went here for a brunch with my toddler daughter after her Sunday morning class. The two people staffing the place were very nice. The atmosphere was very Canadian and eclectic. After I was directed to grab a seat, they offered up a high chair and let me know about the children's books, crayons and coloring books! Score! This kept my little one happy and occupied, which allowed me a pretty relaxed brunch. We ordered a French toast and I grabbed a coffee. The French toast had their own special twist and it was fantastic! It wasn't busy as only one other table was occupied while I was there. I love these little gems and especially when I know it isn't usually rammed. I hope these guys staff in business as I definitely want to come back!"}
{"text":"Another day and another snack would lead me to Boreal - a spot I'd originally considered for brunch but decided against due to traffic - and instead stopping in for some gelato I rather wish I would have passed on all together.  Small and understaffed with a modest selection it would be more than ten minutes of waiting in line before the single server had time to take my order and even then, despite only a single patron before me, it would take another five minutes to deliver my order as she was busy making coffee for one of the seated tables and preparing a waffle for another.

Generally understanding when a store is understaffed that it is certainly not the server's fault, what disappointed me even more about Boreal was the actual quality of the product - my small cup of salted caramel far more sweet than salty and save for the swirls of liquid caramel within lacking much of the expected nuance generally present in salty caramel ice cream.  Dense and creamy I really cannot fault the texture, so perhaps this simply isn't the store's best flavor but at the same time I cannot really say I'd rush back to try others given the overall experience."}
{"text":"Boreal Gelato Company's Lemon Olive Oil Sorbet is quite interesting... Refreshing and light for Summer evening, especially when I just want something light before my meal at Grand Electric...

The interior has this cozy and homey feel...love the sofa... 

Ask for password if you want to use the Wifi."}
{"text":"Was here with friends while waiting for our reservation at a nearby restaurant.  Boreal has a good range of  gelato to try. I got a wild berry  cup which I found very flavourful and natural. I saw other flavours that I liked such as pistachio, balsam,  earl gray , cantaloupe. 
They have a spot to charge your phone and free wifi  and  for that I am also impressed. Boreal even has vegan  gelato which is good if you have vegetarians in the group as it  opens up more options for them to enjoy . 
I plan to try the flavours I liked if  I visit here again.   Good service with helpful cashier . Give this place a try ."}
{"text":"The newly opened Boreal Gelato Company lured me in with its decor.  It looked clean.  It looked modern.  It looked cool.  & it didn't disappoint - it was all of those things!  Their flavors rotate but they have been luscious so far.  The pistachio is subtle & soothing - the pineapple is creamy (but dairy-free!) & not too tangy or acidic.  They also have what my Granny would call \"brave\" flavors - like lemon olive oil.

They're so new & friendly - I hope they stick around."}
{"text":"Wifi, check.
Good coffee, check.
Icy cold treats, check.
AC, check. 

You see that list? That above list is all I need on a day when I'm looking for a place to do remote work for a couple of hours. That list is the mo fo dream, and Boreal delivered. I will be back and then back again."}
