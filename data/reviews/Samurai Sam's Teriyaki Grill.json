{"text":"I love samurai sams and the service from Nacho (the cook) over the years has been great. He is always super friendly and makes the t-bowl just how I like it. I like the white meat chicken bowl with no veggies and brown rice. Comes out to 450 calories a perfect lunch. You can also grab a bottle of the sauce for 5$. My only suggestions for this location would be to have more reading material for the lunch crowd and to give out free side sauces rather than charge 25 cents. Sam Sams is a favorite for a healthy tasty lunch!"}
{"text":"A fast food place, but of all the fast Japanese food places I've been to [and I've tried most of them], I would rate this one highest.  3 stars is the highest I'd rate a fast food joint.  If you get the chicken, I would recommend getting the all white meat rice bowl.  I prefer their beef bowls.  Their sushi rolls are sub-par, and since they are pre-made, I wouldn't recommend them.  Their wraps are good as well."}
{"text":"I ordered a teriyaki bowl, to go. 20 minutes later, I was still waiting. Some people who came in after me had already been served - with the same dish I ordered. Two people who ordered before me hadn't been served yet, either. The cashier didn't even offer an apology when I asked for a refund. She seemed to be on some hell of a drug, or perhaps practicing astral travel while taking orders.  Pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Pretty good for a quick, [relatively] healthy meal. I had the teriyaki bowl with white chicken and brown rice, with extra veggies on the side.   The rice was a little soggy and there was a LOT of it. When I asked how many veggies come on the bowl and was told 3 ounces, I knew I'd want an extra side...for $1.75. Really? For over done broccoli and zucchini? Okay...  My meal came out pretty quickly, and when I got to my office to eat it I noticed they'd already poured teriyaki on top. The rice was saturated--a little too heavy on the sauce for me.   It was tasty, but not the best chicken teriyaki bowl I've had. Samurai Sam's is good for when I'm not in the mood to pack a lunch for work."}
{"text":"My parent's business use to be next door to one of these places....  For this location, I would recommend eating here on the weekdays ONLY. The guy (mencho) that makes the bowl has been doing it for a long time and knows how to make them the best.   If you are really hungry or want to get a bowl for two meals I would recommend the sumo bowl. It only costs 8 dollars + change and its loaded with meat, veggies and rice. Another good entree is the Yaki Soba, which are grilled noodles with veggies (make sure to add your meat choice it costs extra). If you want to give your salad more of a zing rather than the plain rice vinegar go with the ginger dressing - its delicious.   Enjoy the sweetness of  the massive amounts of sugar and tastiness of their Teriyaki sauce! But if you are looking for a healthier option go with the white meat chicken, more veggies than brown rice option. Food is usually pretty fresh.  Remember to get stamp card if you are regular, 10 stamps = $5 off a purchase :)"}
{"text":"The food always tastes good. And more than anything, they always serve it super fast! It is probably faster than McDonald or Burger King. It has been my favorite place to stop by for quick lunch recently.  The only thing they could improve would be keeping the tables a little more clean."}
{"text":"Not all Samurai Sams are created equal! This one is the best by far. I have been going here for over 10 years and something about this location is just better tasting and better quality than the others."}
