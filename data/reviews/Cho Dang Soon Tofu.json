{"text":"Banchan - Chodang's star is always the deep fried tofu. Quickly dipped in the oil, the outer layer is crispy and tasty, while the inside still has a great texture. Made fresh for every customer, the sweet sauce enhances the dish and it never comes out soggy. Deep fried tofu topped with sweet teriyaki sauce, green onions & sesame seeds - Fresh, chilled, firm tofu & soy sauce - wonderful texture & flavour  Chodang's deep fried and firm tofu are always great at showcasing how delicious their freshly made tofu is. If you like it, they sell it separately and sometimes soy milk too. I've taken home a jug of it in the past - no preservatives, silky smooth, and delicious. You need to drink it fast since they only use natural ingredients!  Mushroom SoonTofu is consistently my favourite, it is hearty with several different types of mushrooms and silken (soon) tofu. The mushrooms soak up all of that wonderful flavour.  You can choose mild, medium, or maximum spice. As a huge fan of the heat, I always ask for the max. Just crack your egg right in the bowl and enjoy it poached! I've tried almost all of their bowls. My least favourite is their kimchi bowl, and my second favourite is the traditional Chodang SoonDubu bowl. While I enjoyed their seafood and mixed (which is beef & seafood) versions, call me picky but the lazy foodie in me doesn't like plucking the head off of the prawns, even though that's how it's supposed to be served. The seafood is quite good though, with mussels, squid, and prawns. Yum. Worth a try.  I have yet to try their dumpling bowl, their dumplings are quite tasty so I don't see how you could go wrong there.  Their soy bigi bowl is also tasty but the trek to Etobicoke is always for the soondubu. It's basically a bowl of ground soybeans, nice and thick. Great option for those who don't want to have the silken tofu soup, but like the taste of soy. I have had better biji-jang though.  Every bowl (kimchi in this case) comes with a stone pot filled with rice. The nice, purple-ish colour is from the wild rice. The bottom layer of rice is quite crunchy from the hot stone bowl so water (or in some other restaurants, tea) is poured into the bowl after most of the rice has been scooped out. At the end of your meal, you can just scrape up the loosened rice at the bottom and enjoy it, and drink some of the water too. Or drink it with your meal. Personally, I like mixing my soup with my rice and eating it together - then finishing off with the ricey-water but to each their own.  All of their products are freshly made with wonderful texture & flavour, and they use all natural ingredients - on a daily basis! Their silken tofu, firm tofu, and soy milk are all worth taking home if you like soy products. The owners are so sweet and happy, I love the service. The soup base is flavourful, and the side dishes are always tasty. Great for dinner now, even better in the winter when you want a soup to escape from the cold.  Kachi I found Kachi's soondubu soup on the oily and watery side. The broth was lacking a deep, rich, flavour and their tofu wasn't as tasty. They're known for their pork bone soup anyways (which I don't think is that great either, to be honest).  I've been to Buk Chang Dong several times for SoonTofu as well. It's a solid bowl, and far more convenient for me since I live downtown. They have good side dishes and I've tried just about every soontofu on their menu. I always order the combination bowl, the first item on the menu. Yum! It helps curb my cravings when I can't get down to Chodang.  Wonjo also makes a solid bowl. The quality of the broth and the amount of meat given are similar to Chodang, but I personally prefer Chodang's silken tofu. What can I say? The freshness and texture can't be beat and I love, love, love the owners. While not horrible, Wonjo's interior could use a little retouching when compared to Chodang. However, Wonjo's consistently receives rave reviews, so it may just boil down to personal preference (as it often does!). Wonjo is a good deal for a wider variety of soups at a decent price. I've tried their Korean beef stew (Gomtang) and Korean ginseng soup (Samgyetang), all tasty for less than $10.  As for Chodang, I will admit I've never ventured past the left side of the menu - I'm so addicted to the soup that the idea of ordering katsu, teriyaki, or tempura seems like a waste of a trip. I've tried their table cooked stew called \"Chodang's Best\" which, shamefully, I don't really remember (which to me means that I didn't like it more than the soontofu).  At $7.08 this meal is a great deal  Again, everyone has different tastes and look for different things when it comes to soontofu soup. There are so many ways to tweak it (just look up some recipes, and you'll see what I mean). Not everyone is obsessive as I am when it comes to hunting for the best bowl of things like soondubu soup"}
{"text":"Found this little place while driving around for dinner.  We were a little cautious at first but then observed that almost everyone in the restaurant were Koreans, a sure sign that the food is authentic and good.  Sure enough, it did not disappoint as the side dishes came out and were delicious, the tofu soup was everything I was expecting, and the fried fish was delicious as well, an added bonus that is typical in tofu houses but have been absent in a lot of the Toronto tofu houses.    Service was a bit slow as there was only one server, but she was polite and the food was delicious.  Would definitely go back again after finding this gem."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant for soon tofu. Their tofu so soft and delicious, and there's always a generous portion of it in the soup. They also offer a great variety of soon tofu, ranging from mushrooms to seafood to dumplings. If you are especially hungry, I highly recommend the tofuyaki, deep fried tofu smothered in sweet soy sauce, black and white sesame seeds and green onion. Eat it while it's crispy and piping hot!   Great food aside, the service is seriously lacking (and this has been repeatedly noted here). If you come during peak lunch hour, be ready to be frustrated while waiting for upwards of an hour. There's only one old lady working the front of the restaurant, and it's way too much for her to handle. Between taking orders, delivering the food, cleaning up tables and taking money, service slows down tremendously. Even when tables are vacated, it takes her at least 15 minutes to clear them before a new group can sit down.   When you finally get to order, everything else speeds up. Food comes quickly and it's obvious that the slow turnover is not the kitchen's fault. The main caveat is only come here if you have the patience."}
{"text":"Whenever I feel like a warm homey meal I think of this place. My favorite is the dumpling soon tofu. I ask for mild. One time I asked for none spicy at all and the whole red sauce was missing so there was no flavor.   They serve excellent side dishes especially the deep fried fish.   Service is slow because there's only 1 waitress.    But you can't beat the quality of the food for the price.  I will be back.!"}
{"text":"I live close by so i have been to this restaurant a few times. Each time the service gets worse and worse. I get that this is a family business and they only have 1 waitress but does it hurt to smile at customers. I asked her if she had kimichi as a side dish and she just ran away. Everytime that I've been there i had kimichi as a side dish so i don't understand why i wouldn't  get it this time.  All the other tables had it.  After this experience I would never go back"}
{"text":"Food is very tasty and fresh. I love the complimentary fish that comes with the banchan.  I always get the soon tofu and my husband loves the pork donkatsu and tofuyaki."}
{"text":"Nice place to try out. They give a lot if tofu in their soup. I prefer their bento boxes  though. Their side dishes were pretty awesome, which includes the usual Kim chi, bean sprout, radish, but also deep fried fish"}
{"text":"Love this place! Like another reviewer said - it's like eating at your aunts house. Food is so comforting and the little place is very quaint. Come here if you want really quality, authentic Korean food."}
{"text":"Fresh soft silky tofu!   We came in hungry on a whim and ordered the dumpling and mixed soontobu and was filled to the brim by the time we left. The meal started with the typical banchan side dishes with fried fish which was absolutely unexpected but so delicious! The soontobu had perfect soft tofu and spice level for me who doesn't usually take spicy well! The meal came with healthy mixed purple rice in a stone pot which the lady scooped out into a side bowl and added hot water to the bottom scorched rice for a nice cooling 'congee' at the end of the meal.  Serve your own water from the water dispenser by the cashier.  We left with two squares of fresh tofu, $3 each. They claim their tofu is made from local-grown soybeans and non-GMO. Bonus!"}
{"text":"A spontaneous Korean food craving lead me to find this place located near Kipling TTC station. The place is small, as other reviewers have mentioned, with around 8 tables.  I asked to sit toward the back of the restaurant as there were only larger tables near the front, and the owner, an older Korean lady (and the only person there I could see), waved her hand and stopped me from going back there. I ordered and asked for medium spice and this was dismissed - no response from the shopowner.   The side dishes came quickly - kimchi, cold tofu, bean sprouts, pickled radish. All were decent, but nothing noteworthy. Small portions about a tablespoon in size each. The fried fish was unique and quite tasty. I ordered the seafood soon tofu and it arrived shortly after. At this time, I requested additional side dishes of bean sprouts and kimchi. The owner looked at me and didn't acknowledge my request - I had a similar experience to other reviewers; I didn't know if she hadn't heard me or understood me, and she just walked away.  Quite some time passed before I received the rice to accompany my dish. At this time, I asked again for the side dishes, thinking she hadn't heard me. She just stared at me, looking annoyed. This time I got the message that she wasn't going to give me any, except that she hadn't said anything. I know she speaks English because she had taken my order in English earlier...  The food itself was mediocre. Not spicy at all and a bit bland. It did have 2 oysters in it, but otherwise it was on the poor side of soon tofu dishes I have tried all over Toronto (North York, Koreatown, Mississauga, etc.). Additionally, I've NEVER been to a Korean restaurant that wasn't happy to top up on side dishes- I have been to Korea and was told this is normal part of their culture. Wasn't impressed that not only did she not top them up, she also didn't explicitly tell me that and chose to ignore my request.  It came to $9 with tax. The combination of poor service and mediocre food would not bring me back here again."}
{"text":"Very disappointing taste and portion. Ordered a beef soon tofu there is barely any minced beef there. Tasteless. Once and done"}
{"text":"We love this place because we love their tofu! Very fresh and silky smooth! The place is small and service could be slow like other reviews mentioned. So we always asked for take out!  It's  interesting that we have never had the fried fish that is supposed to come with the soon tofu!! May be because we do take out?  Their bimbimbop and bulgogi were very decent! But we mainly came for soon tofu!  This place could be bigger with more help! But for the food and the price, I have no complain!"}
{"text":"Out of all the soft tofu restaurants ive gone to, this one would be my top choice. Ive tried all the different kinds of the tofu stew and it never disappointed me and for the price you get enough food to fill you up. The only thing they can work on is customer service."}
{"text":"The Soup Nazi has nothing on the stern woman who runs this affordable tofu eatery. She is unfriendly, rude, probably racist and totally unwelcoming. Too bad, because the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I didn't have the same experience as traveller T. I went with a toddler (2.5 yrs) and the lady was very friendly with him, playing with him (even though she could not speak much English). They aren't very fast since it seems like she is the only one working the tables, she barely has time to visit you so we definitely didn't feel any of the pressure that traveller T felt.  Food-wise it is okay. The Soon Tofu which should be the crowning glory considering the crazy rave Toronto Life review was just okay. I found the soup itself to not have much flavor, although I'm sure the tofu itself is very fresh. I like the Soon Tofu place at Bloor/Christie better. The selection of banchan is quite interesting and good. The toasted dumplings are probably the best dish here."}
{"text":"Horrible service by the old lady there. I was standing at the door for 5 mins and told her I'm here only for one person. She didn't respond, and after that she went in and out of the kitchen many times, I'm very sure she saw me, and just ignored me! When I came to the front desk, she even used the food service cart to push me out of there and said we don't have space here. That's super unacceptable.  Before I went, I saw the bad reviews and didn't believe the whole story. But it really happened, and if you don't want to ask for a terribly day, just don't go there."}
{"text":"Terrible service - There's an old lady who does everything...serving food and cashing out..etc (not sure if she's the owner but she really did freak me out...moody and grumpy.  Mediocre Food - Tasteless, nothing good....that fried fish...was yuck!!!! If you want to taste good soon tofu - go to Buk Chang Dong!   Dirty inside - depressing atmosphere so outdated and dark!...seriously...something is so weird about this restaurant.   Honestly I don't know why this place has such great reviews....probably from non-Korean people who doesn't even know anything about korean food  or their family members or friends."}
{"text":"I love Korean food - gamjatang, bibimbap, pancakes, dumplings, rice wine - but I had no idea what soon tofu was. But after reading all the great reviews here, we decided to go for it! And I must say - where have you been all my life soon tofu?!   I had the dumpling soon tofu which came with purple rice and fried fish and it was so so so very good. They also give you an egg which you need to break and stir into the steaming hot bowl so you get a poached egg and creamy, think sauce. Nom nom nom.  I still don't exactly know what soon tofu is - soup, tofu, rice, whatever - all I know is that it is a bowl of yumminess and deliciousness that I still dream about days after I had it. Maybe I should go again tomorrow...  PS: I would have given 5 stars if not for the slightly slow service the night we were there. But hey, it was well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible service!!  First of all, I did went there a few times as she was nice at first time but every time it just get worse. I thought perhaps she has trouble understanding English and I felt bad she did not have a help in the restaurant. I remember one time I asked for a mild tofu soup but it turned out to be super spicy and when I wanted to double check with her for what I ordered. She refused to talk to me and kept saying it's mild. Another time we ordered 2 bento box and she serve us with 2 side dishes when all the other table have more than 4. We asked for kimchi but she did not even response and walk away. She treats every table differently. I saw her smiling with other people and checking on them see if they are ok. I realize she only pretend to speak a few words in English when she is moody or doesn't want to respond to you. I can't believe how can such a bad place gets so many good reviews."}
{"text":"First time try this restaurant, great food nice service. Tofu yaki is the best!! Crispy outside and inside soft. The side dish serve fried fish is very delicious!! It seems like not all the Korean restaurant serve fried fish, very rare. The soon tofu surprised me that the whole soup are full of tofu, but mice beef are very few. I tried soon tofu at other restaurant that contain a lot of items in the soup not just only tofu. But my husband order seafood soon tofu, the shrimps are delicious, it taste more salty but rich in flavor. It feel like they season shrimp with salt before. Overall, i like it, will come back again."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Etobicoke and I have been coming for years! I 100% recommend the tofu yaki. Their tofu is so great and fresh. The little Korean woman that serves is so kind and helpful. There's not much I can say because I just love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great mom and pop restaurant with fast efficient service. The homemade tofu in all the dishes are delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap. Super fresh, silky smooth tofu. Get the mushroom tofu bowl."}
{"text":"Chodang is a little restaurant that doesn't seat many and it's usually pretty busy (unless you go on a weeknight) because it's gaining popularity everyday.  They are known for making their own tofu in the back of the restaurant.  They sell the tofu seperately as well.  Their menu is simple enough to read since it's in Korean and English. They don't have a lot of variety but most people that go there eat the Soontofu (tofu stew). The portions are for one person and it's definitely enough but if you're hungry enough, you can try the boiled or toasted dumplings!   As with all Korean meals, it comes with side dishes that include fried fish, cold tofu, bean sprouts, kimchi and sometimes tofuyaki if the restaurant is not busy.    I ordered the pork soontofu and Monica ordered the oyster soontofu. Each bowl of soontofu comes with a raw egg that you can break into the stew to make it thicker if you want. You can choose how spicy you want the stew to be. She prepares the rice into a separate bowl and then pours hot tea into the stone pot to loosen the rice. You eat the soaked rice at the end and it's good for digestion.   The price including tax and tip is around $10 for each bowl of soontofu and it keeps you very full and is a great source of protein. It's definitely a place worth checking out as it's the BEST soontofu in Toronto.  We go every couple of months with famiyl and friends."}
{"text":"My bro and I arrived at 8:15 pm (they were scheduled to close at 9pm), I smiled and said hi and asked for a table for 3 (my partner was on his way), and the woman who works there scowled at me. Ok. We sat at the table she pointed to anyway; I thought maybe she's having a bad day. She's been moody before.   She approached our table about 3 minutes later to take our orders. I answered saying that we're waiting for the third person and we'll order when he arrives.   Then she asked, \"when?\".  I said, \"He's on his way. We live 2 minutes from here.\" She asked, again, even louder, \"when?\". \"WHEN?\"  I couldn't believe it. Does arriving at an empty restaurant 45 minutes before it closes allow one to treat its patrons like shit?  My partner literally arrived right after the third time she asked \"when?\". My bro and I ordered, my partner quickly ordered before he even had the chance to take his seat since she was still at our table.  A few minutes after she'd taken our order, a party of three people of Korean descent entered the restaurant. She greeted them with smiles and laughter. Wow. Her mood completely changed. Fake. Fake. Fake.   It was at that moment my bro, partner and I decided to leave the restaurant; we promised ourselves never to return again.   I know that my review won't affect the business since a fair number of people of Korean descent live in the area. So they'll remain open for business.  I had to share my experience since I'm hopeful that we're not the only ones she's treated like shit - because we're not bad people and in solidarity.   But, seriously, wow. She was unapologetically rude and disrespectful. I can honestly say that I've never been treated with such blatant disrespect at a restaurant in my entire life.  Let me end the review with this: it's worth the drive (and wait) to Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu. They have better Soon Tofu and I believed this since the very first time I tried Cho Dang's. I stand by it. I only went to Cho Dang since I live in the area. You will get Better service and food at Buk Chang Dong.   After the shitty service at Cho Dang we ended up at Gohyang, where they had great service and food!"}
{"text":"Excellent place, excellent food and run by very kind people :) If you like tofu you are at the right place...they make their own!!  I do recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Chodang has good soon tofu but I find that the broth can be inconsistent. Some days a medium is medium and some days it's crazy spicy. I took a friend here because it's close to my home. She's Korean and asked for her soon tofu really spicy in Korean. Well it didn't come out spicy so my friend asked if it could be changed. The lady wo runs the front end flat out said no it could not be changed in a rude way. I find that the lady who runs the front end can be rude at times.   My favorite dish is the deep fried tofu. Their soon tofu is always fresh. Overall, the value for the meal is great for the amount of food you get for under $10. They serve a lot of ban chan (side dishes).  Also since they had the write up in Toronto Life, it has gotten a lot busier. They really need to hire some help because at times when I go in there, I find that the lady cannot keep up. So there are tables full of dirty dishes that need clearing, people waiting by the door, and she's running around serving customers. Some days the food takes forever to come out too."}
{"text":"Don't sleep on the dumplings and katsu, both are delicious alternatives to the soon tofu.  Chodang is a small family owned restaurant that is often busy but the owners are extremely friendly and the food is affordable and fantastic.  Will definitely go back for seconds!"}
{"text":"Quaint mom and pop shop. Service is not exciting but efficient.   Side order of one small fish, was very nicely fried with a light crisp outer shell.   Tofu was silkie smooth and tasted homemade. Would come again if I were in the neighborhood but wouldn't necessarily cross town for."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place doesn't have more reviews, especially after its appearance in Toronto Life! Before I went off to college, my family would eat here at least once a week (although menu prices have increased by a dollar since a year ago). We've gotten to know the owners and the husband is super nice- when it was my birthday they gave me two pairs of socks, which was hilarious!)  I love this place because it's homey and serves great side dishes!  When you first sit down, they'll bring out fresh cold tofu with a soy sauce reduction- it's a great starter and the tofu is more firm than most of what you'll be seeing later on, which makes for nice variation.  The next side dishes (which some free with every meal, as in most Korean restaurants): 1) Kimchi: just your average kimchi, could be a little spicier, although the soon tofu makes up for that. 2) Bean sprouts: fresh, cool, and nice to cleanse the palate. 3) Pickled radish: Crunchy and yummy :) 4) Fried fish: THESE ARE SO GOOD. Although hard to manoeuvre with the bones, the taste is salty and crisp and it's one of my favorite parts about the meal!  After serving the rice and soon tofu, another side dish will come out- it's deep fried firm tofu with a sweet sauce on top, which is freshly made and tastes AMAZING.  If you order soon tofu, it comes with an egg to poach.  Here are the entrées I've had:  Soon tofu: In general, the soup base tastes the same, although spiciness varies every time (I end up requesting less spicy a lot) -Mushroom: Great, wide variety of mushrooms that complement the texture of the soft tofu nicely and soak up the flavor nicely (as another poster said) -Seafood: Decent amount of seafood, not as much as some other places though. The prawn and mussel in it are yummy though! -Dumpling: My FAVORITE. Pleaseeee try this. The dumplings are tiny and delicate, and the dough/meat complement the tofu very well! Lots of dumplings in each bowl, freshly made too! -Pork: Good, but I would recommend the mushroom or dumpling unless you MUST have pork.  Other entrées: -Fried dumplings: Pretty good -Tonkatsu: Thin but well fried, maybe a bit too much batter for some but I like it :) -Soy bigi: Definitely an acquired taste, my parents ordered it so I can't say much about it.  Definitely give this place a try- it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"The worst service, not delicious food, price just regular.  Inside and outside of the place 2 out of 5 , just because I did see anything really ugly. .."}
{"text":"Honestly...   What do people see in this place?  Restaurants like these make me wish yelp had a 0 star rating.   I came here on the rave reviews that other Yelp users gave it and I was extremely disappointed.   I don't have many good things to say about this place. The food was average and does NOT make up for the horrible excuse for customer service that we received.   So here's a list...  1) upon entrance, hardly a greeting or an effort to seat us 2) for the appetizers the portions were less that usual 3) we asked for more kimchi appetizer and the lady rudely waves her finger and said \"no\".  4) we asked for more napkins and she directed us to take it from the other table  5) we asked for more tea/water and she pointed at the water cooler suggesting that we get up and get it ourselves  6) we asked for the bill and she walked past us pretending not to hear  7) while paying, I used debit and was trying to put my PIN number in and she took the machine mid entry of my pin, as if I were going to steal it  Honestly, I've been to restaurants where service is bad but this takes the cherry. I honestly cannot believe how someone can run their establishment like so. Boasting that they use freshest ingredients each day, and bragging with articles on the walls of how their food was featured in toronto life.  I started to question, is it just me?! Or is everyone else just crazy to think this place is even remotely good... And using researching I noticed that most of these highly rated reviews were prior to 2014. So my guess is the owner changed and the new one has a mission to drive the business into the ground.   Normally I wouldn't be upset about the list that I presented.  But if you're going to list yourself as a restaurant, then you should provide the basic services all restaurants have.  I wouldn't be as upset if the single lady who was working here was swamped with a bunch of customers. But she literally had maybe 3 tables at the time and most of the time was just twiddling her thumbs.    Truly disappointed and I will NEVER be coming here again."}
{"text":"Great place for delicious silky soon tofu soup and rice meals!  I really like to and always start with the yaki tofu. Then I usually go for the seafood or oyster soontofu.  Taste delicious and very cozy place. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I LOVE soon tofu so I just had to try this place close to work.  It's small with less than 7 tables.  Don't come for the decor come for the tofu!!  We ordered seafood soon tofu, toasted dumplings and the bulgogi bento box.  Got a free side of their fresh tofu.  The sides included a generous mound of bean sprouts, a grilled fish and radish kimchi. The dumplings looked like they were made on site.  Light and crispy skin with a meat filling and a garlicky dip.  The soon tofu came super hot and sizzling bubbly goodness and the accompanying rice with crispy rice crust soup yum!!  The fried tofu that came  with the bulgogi and as a side dish is to die for!  Light crispy batter surrounding a soft pillow of creamy tofu  that melts in your mouth.... Bulgogi was a huge portion of beef and a horrible side of cooked salmon sushi.  Stick to the tofu!!"}
{"text":"The TL:DR version of this review is that it is awesome (and you should get the Mushroom Soon Tofu)!  My girlfriend and I have been to Cho Dang 3 times in the past week, having recently moved to the area. It's easy to miss the place if you don't pay attention, but this is a place you do not want to miss. We had the following dishes the 3 times we were there:  1st time: Mushroom Soon Tofu & Tofu Katsu 2nd time: Mushroom Soon Tofu & Kimchi Soon Tofu 3rd time: Mushroom Soon Tofu, Vegetarian Steamed Dumplings, and Tofu Kimchi (pork, tofu, & kimchi)  As you can tell, the soon tofu is what kept up coming back (and my girlfriend cannot get enough of the mushroom soon tofu)! Every time it came with banchan (3 plates of pickled radishes, beansprouts, and kimchi) as well as a fried fish for every order of Soon Tofu, all which were consistently delicious. Additionally, they make their own tofu! Having learned about the process ourselves, it is impressive that they are able to make it in-house, and you can definitely taste the difference that fresh tofu makes.  The atmosphere is perfect for the two of us: cozy, soft classical music in the background, and not too loud. A great place for enjoying your meal and spending some time with a friend or loved one.  The service was good, too, and improves with each visit as our faces become more familiar! While a number of other reviews take issue with the waitress, she was attentive and brought out our food within a couple minutes of us ordering. On our most recent visit, she even showed me (a mid 20s caucasian male) how to properly combine the parts of the Tofu Kimchi for maximum enjoyment! There may be a bit of a language barrier, but the service so far has only bettered our experience with Cho Dang :)  The menu is relatively small. The dishes are all centered around tofu and the dishes are primarily soon tofu, stews, katsu, and some dumplings. We have not been let down by anything we have tried.  In summary, if you have an interest in soon tofu or enjoy fresh tofu, this place is not to be missed! We're making our way through the menu (and more Mushroom Soon Tofu) with no signs of stopping! :)"}
{"text":"So my rant is just about the take out for this restaurant.  So they obviously listed that they do take out on their window, but when I called, they lady hung up on me after tell me \"no take out over phone\".  Came to the restaurant to order, they have menus for people to take away for take out order . Had to wait about 20 mins to pick it up.    I asked for less spicy and pretty much got just tofu broth with seafood.  No, I kid you not, the broth tasted like tofu water without salt....  Never coming back again... this is total bullshit!"}
{"text":"Homemade tofu.  Very tasty. Just come and eat here, you won't be disappointed if you like Korean food."}
{"text":"I read such good reviews of this place, that I decided to try it out.  It was definitely interesting!!  Ordered the home-made tofu and the bimimbap.  Now, I am no tofu expert, but I did notice that the tofu was soft and creamy.  There was little to no taste to it though.  The side dishes were a nice treat, especially the whole fried fish.  The bimimbap was okay.  I did notice a sign that they do not use MSG, so I figure this place cooks \"healthy\", hence, the lack of saltiness in the food.  After the meal, they pour water into your rice bowl.  I was not sure if I was supposed to drink the water and was checking the other patrons to see what I was supposed to do with this rice bowl recently filled with water.  I was in shock, amazed, thrilled, curious all at the same time, just like when I was a fob and did not understand why they brought me a side of water with lemon after a meal at Swiss Chalet!  Lol.  I then, of course, had to google the whole situation and figured out that the water softens the hardened rice on the side so I can eat it?  I also read that the bowls they used do not need dishwashing? Hmmmm.  Anyway, definitely an experience to dine here!"}
{"text":"I went here based on high reviews.  Sounds like they make great food but the service is just not tolerable.  Sat there on a busy night.  People arrived after me got their order before me because they spoke their language.  I was totally ignored for twenty minutes.  I tried to speak to the one lady server there three times but she wouldn't stop to take my order but she took the order from another table.  I get that it's busy and I don't mind waiting but serving two tables that came after me is so rude! I just couldn't stay any longer."}
{"text":"Took a chance on a new Korean place and it was phenomenal! Easily the best tofu I've had anywhere. The soon tofu/bulgogi/tofu-yaki combo for $40 feeds 3-4 people  easily you could maybe order an extra soup to share. It also comes with appetizer dishes, two absolutely delicious fried fish, rice and a post meal rice water bowl that tastes like rice infused green tea sort of. What a fantastic meal that will turn into enough leftovers for perhaps two more meals for 2 people. Such a gem. I can't believe one woman runs this whole place on her own. It is amazing. Service was great and I can't believe other people would complain. Ignore them, we will keep coming back!!"}
{"text":"I visited Chodang SoonTofu with high hopes after reading the rave reviews on Yelp and Toronto Life.   In one sentence, Chodang has strong potential in their food but their service is a huge letdown. The restaurant is super tiny, with room for about 15 diners. There are posters everywhere regarding the health and their procedure of preparing tofu, which was interesting but neither here nor there.   I ordered the Mushroom Soon Tofu (I believe every Soon Tofu dish is $8) and it was overloaded with deliciously chewy assorted Asian mushrooms. The spice level was just okay, though the lady taking orders, and by taking orders I mean she walked over to the table and stared at us unsmilingly until we said something. I've never been to a Korean restaurant with service this brusque.  5 different banchan were placed on the table, including an egg in a bowl as a nice detail. There was a deep fried fish as well, but it was about 30% grease and 50% bones.   I would have loved to come here again, but I'm not sure I would return with the service the way it is. In an empty restaurant you'd think you'd get acknowledge when very obviously trying to get someone's attention. Not here. I gather she is the 'wife' as I never saw the husband anywhere. Hopefully this wasn't a one off case as a result of a marital tiff."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Korean place in Toronto. I'm a vegetarian and I loved the homemade soon tofu.   The vegetarian meal for 2 is a great deal. You get a lot of different dishes that are all delicious."}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving soon tofu soup so we came here as she lives just down the street from the restaurant. I was a bit wary because of the mixed reviews and my friend did warn me before going in that service can be a little bit of hit or miss. So I went into it with lowered expectations, which is maybe why I came out pretty satisfied.   As soon as we went in, the lady (who seemed to be the only employee there) greeted us from behind the counter and directed us to our table. The menus are posted on the walls and she came by pretty quickly to ask us for our orders. Luckily, I always order the same thing at soon tofu places and we ordered - a seafood soon tofu soup for my friend and dumpling soon tofu for me. She also brought out three side dishes - kimchi, pickled radish, and soy bean sprouts. In addition, she brought out some small deep fried fish that was so good that I wish I could have had more.   The soup came with the typical things you get at other soon tofu places - a raw egg to crack into your soup as well as a hot pot of rice that the lady scooped out into a bowl and poured hot water into the hot pot. I, personally, don't like the toasty rice in the hot pot after the water is poured so I wish she had scooped more of the rice into my bowl. However, portion-wise it was more than enough and super filling.   Taste-wise I really like this tofu place. They say they make their tofu in house and I guess it did have a different texture than other restaurants (though I don't know if I would have noticed if I didn't read the sign). The thing I really liked about their soup, however, was that it didn't taste overly salty and didn't leave that residue on my tongue that I get from other restaurants. I also didn't get the typical food coma that I usually get when I eat at other restaurants with a lot of MSG in their soon tofu. Also, for my dumpling soon tofu they used the small round water dumplings that, in my opinion, are much tastier than the half moon dumplings other places use.   Overall, the place is super modest and probably doesn't have as friendly, clean, or fast service as other places. However, it's also not bad and was relatively clean. I didn't feel the service was slow, and the food was definitely worth the $25 for the two soups after tax and tip. Add in the fried fish and it was more than worth it. I would definitely come back here especially when I visit my friend."}
{"text":"One of my favourite mom-and-pop shops. I went there last night to satisfy my soon tofu craving and wasn't disappointed. The tofu is always so fresh and the dumplings are a must-try. The prices are unbelievably good for what you get. I recommend getting the chodang soon tofu if you're a real fan of traditional korean food. The chicken katsu is also well done and the servings are large.  With regards to the service, I absolutely adore the little Korean woman. Service may get a little slow if it's rammed, but she does her best to get around to everyone."}
{"text":"First, the tofu is house made and is outstanding. Portions and flavours are great and it is a regular spot for a bunch of us. It is a two person operation: husband cooks and wife serves. If you want high end service don't come here. This is more like eating at your aunt's house and if you need an extra napkin you go get it. Those who rate the food bad did not try the soups as they are really good (and yes we've eaten there with native Koreans) and those who complain about server attitude need to understand that the woman serving does it all by herself. Maybe you could drop the entitlement and just pitch in and enjoy the experience and the food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's pretty much the only good place to get quality Korean food in Etobicoke! I've had the   (seafood tofu soup) maybe over four times and it has always as s been great... My Mom and friend tried the spicy chicken Benton box and it was great as well...I tried one of the sweet potato sushi from their bento's... loved it!  Side dishes are great too! I took off one star because the service is a bit slow... but it is only one middle aged lady running the shop.and one cool at the back.. so.it's expected...  try to go when it is not busy... around 1pm/ 2pm/ 3pm"}
{"text":"The best soon tofu in Toronto! Homemade on the premises and extremely soft.  The Banchan (the free starters before your meal) includes a fried small mackerel now which other restaurant can say that? Along with the other usual suspects.  The chestnut rice is on point and the soup is always full bodied and chock-full of ingredients.  While the restaurant itself is small it is full of surprises like they make their own wine!"}
{"text":"The best agedashi tofu anywhere! The pork soup is excellent. Complimentary sides are very good especially the fried fish. Amazing value. Not 5 star due to poor service and mediocre atmosphere. The lady in the front of the house is exactly as described in many reviews; however, it's such good quality and value that people will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Over the past five or six years I have been here over a dozen times and still love coming back.  Especially on a cold day, this wonderful Korean gem of a place will warm you to the core!    This place is not fancy and as the sign on the fridge says. They make food to be good quality and are willing to sacrifice taste. However I think it tastes great every time.   Today we had two salmon soon tofu bowls and the toasted dumplings. Everything is so fresh and made with great ingredients. You can actually taste the goodness in every bite.   They actually make their own fresh tofu here from organic non-gmo soy beans and it is amazing.   For those who are new to Korean fare, the meal starts with a fried fish which is just perfectly cooked. You get one each. You can order some appetizers like the toasted dumplings (think Korean perogies, or gyoza). They are cooked crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Careful, as they do come very hot. You can also get them boiled only, but toasted is better.  And you usually get sprouts kimchi, tofu and other little bowls for extra flavours.   The soon tofu bowls are hot and have tofu in them. Surprise!    Ours had salmon which is more expensive but, so tasty. The soup can be mild, medium or spicy and I would always recommend the medium or spicy as you get another bowl of hot water with rice and can always add some water if yours is too spicy. You also get an egg that you crack into your soup and it cooks in the bubbling broth.   Other varieties include pork, mushroom, kimchi, seafood and other soon tofu bowls.   You also get purple rice with the bowl. I like to throw it into the soup, some people like it on the side. And if you are wondering, it is a combination of white and another rice that gives it the magical colour.   Warm, delicious, hearty and definitely filling. You will not be disappointed.   On a funny note. One lady and I believe her husband in the back do it all. So service may be a little slow and she does have an interesting attitude but I like it. Some may be put off by it. So just a little warning. In a quirky way I think it adds to the experience!"}
{"text":"If you like soft tofu soup, this is it. In my opinion best you can have.   If you like spicy, ask for extra spicy as myself and my friends generally find their normal spicy doesn't have enough kick. Good price quick service, great food."}
{"text":"The thing to order here is any of their soontofu.  Bibimbap is decent too, but my real enjoyment is in their stews!  Personally, I'm not really big on katsu/schnitzel meals, so I don't order them.  However, I do notice that their Eastern European clientele tend to order these dishes.  Again, I like slightly more balanced meals, so I skip this section of the menu!  Yesterday, I ordered Spicy Chicken Bento.  And although I loved the other elements that came with the bento, particularly their tofuyaki/yam makis (side salad is also very fresh), I wasn't totally in love with their Spicy Chicken.    Note:  It actually is spicy and there's lots of it!  A good 2-3 servings for me, so I took the rest as a takeout.  What I'm not fond of in their Spicy/Teriyaki Chicken is the cut of chicken that they use.  I think it's dark meat which also includes the skin, some fat/gristle.   So going forward, I think I'll stick to one of their homey stews and if I'm really, really hungry, an app of their tofuyaki!"}
{"text":"Everything that is important to me in a restaurant, I found here (today). First off, a quiet, serene and peaceful restaurant.  Ahhh.  Clientele, quiet.  Music, classical, subdued and barely audible.  Service - fantastic.  Very attentive Adjuma who magically arrived with the ttukbegae of bubbling, rich, delicious goodness.  I had the kimchi soondufu (extra gochu) and Spouse had the hwae-mool (fish/seafood).  It was exquisite to die for incredible.  Not overly salty and MSG-laden.  Just solid, down to earth, natural, home made good food.  Tubu is made on the premises at the restaurant.  It does not get any fresher than that, folks!  Fluffy dolsot pap (stone pot steamed rice) and sufficient panchan.  Really good dining experience.  We happened to be in that part of the city for other reasons and stopped in -- and I am so glad we did.  Definitely a place to go back to.  It is always nice to have a pleasurable dining experience where the food is excellent and the noise level not in your face and obnoxious."}
{"text":"Wow. This restaurant has to be the worst Korean restaurant I've been to.  I went on dinner time on Saturday, and surprised to find the place empty. Only two other tables. Despite not being busy, no greeting upon entry.   The prices are ridiculously expensive. A 'Pork Bone Soup that usually costs around $7-9 at regular Korean restaurants, they were charging over $10. Be expected to pay $3~5 more here. Trust me, go somewhere else for this price.   Portions are very small. You would expect huge portions for that price. Nope. You actually get way less.   Taste was nothing special. Mediocre at best.   The waitress was very awkward, and was not helpful when we asked questions about the menu.   This is my second time here, and first time I came here last year, I had a good experience. I heard the management changed, and they are literally killing this place.   Waste of money. Would not come back."}
{"text":"A little treasure of the Kipling, for sure! Traditional Korean food, cozy atmosphere, cheap-cheap-cheap!"}
{"text":"Worst  Korean restaurant ever in my life as bad service and horrible taste!!! I wish I can give zero star instead of 1 start!   Its so hard to be a bad restaurant because most of restaurant have a good service with bad taste or amazing taste with bad service.   It can't be together Bad taste+Bad service!!!   I'm wondering how they can keep  their business like that. But I'm going to write my first restaurant review after I tasted of hell and experienced of hell in this restaurant .  Go there if you are a horrible cooker like I am.  Then you will be so proud of yourself as a Master chef and found your new talent from cooking.  This restaurant has these... 1. Bad service with no greeting & bad attitude 2. Washroom was really mess and dirty  3. Playing  Radio + Korean Drama at the same time is too annoying !!! I cant even have a conversation.  4. Food is horrible.  First I'm a Korean and I know what is original  Sundubu taste from Korea.  (tofu soup)  Their raw uncooked Tofu taste better than cooked tofu soup!!!  Their soup tastes like they put so much butter inside of soup.   no pepper no garlic no onion no fish soup base no vegetables at all..  Its like they just put tofu with small beef ground meat with orange color on it.  And all he banchan (small dishes) was so salty include Kimchi.  I know Korean food is quite salty and Koreans love Salton food.  But it was way to salty and too much sauce for chicken katsu. Almost like chicken katsu sauce soup...    chicken katsu tastes like a old chicken and smelled so bad even with the sauce.  They dont know about food business at all.   First I asked waitress about food and i told her the soup doesnt taste anything it tastes like butter +water + tofu +beef.  So I asked the waitress about soup and asked if she can give me some pepper powder so I can put some and she said \" No. Our food doesnt have any MSG. Thats why it tastes like something is missing or not taste right.   Yes.. you are giving me healthy soup but you gave me 1kg of salt for kimchi. Thank you for worrying about my health and try to cover up nicely your cooking skill.   Nobody want to spend money for buttery water soup for Korean food.   She told me its healthier without MSG but!!!!! She said a lot of her client asked her same questions like i asked.  ???????    Yes for sure a lot of Korean asked her what the fu** is this soup.   Don't try to say to me this is healthy food I'm health enough to eat junk food or whatever what I want.  All the food was so super salty except the soup  It was lunch time but nobody was there..  Now I know why.  Never go there again."}
{"text":"yummy tofu soup and spicy chicken bento box! portion was great and love the free grilled fish"}
{"text":"Don't expect great service here but my 2nd visit I managed to get a smile outta the owner/server/hostess. Tofu is definitely exceptional and fresh! Prices are good too reasonable. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place is great and cheap. The food is great, the tofu is great, everything's great! The only downside might be parking and how there is only one waitress, besides that, I love coming here. Edit: yea this place has gone down hill, service is lacking"}
{"text":"It was just a couple of years ago that I was introduced to Korean tofu soup, and I'm not sure if there's anywhere in the GTA that does the dish as well as Cho Dang Soon Tofu.  We arrived around lunchtime on a weekend and the place was surprisingly uncrowded. (It's been far busier on other visits.)  I knew walking in that I wanted to order one of their Soon Tofu Bowls, so I decided to go with their namesake: the Chodang (with beef).  We were first presented with the various accompaniments one expects from a Korean joint, with the kimchi certainly an obvious standout. (It was flavorful without being pungent, and pleasantly spicy.)  The soup arrived shortly after, and, as expected, it was still bubbling in its stone bowl. We also received purple rice to go with the meal, so I poured a little soup atop that and initially ate it that way. (It was a good 15 minutes or so before the soup had cooled down enough to be edible.)  Anyway, the soup is quite tasty. It's packed with silky pieces of tofu and (somewhat questionable) pieces of beef, and though it's not the most flavorful dish you'll ever eat, there's an undercurrent of deliciousness that grows on you as you eat it. (The spice factor doesn't hurt, either.)  The surly waitress notwithstanding, Cho Dang Soon Tofu is definitely a must for fans of Korean tofu soup."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know where all these good reviews are coming from. Been here twice and I had the same experience both times.   - Super slow service that borders on rude: we arrived and waited for a clean table. There was only one woman serving four tables, cashing someone out and she was bringing out the food. After a rather longish wait for her to clear off one table (probably 15 minutes) she removed the old plates. No wipe down of the table. I would have wiped it down but there were no napkins and the other tables were all dirty as well. We sat and waited some more. Eventually we got place mats and cutlery. No menu. Eventually we got menus. To put this into perspective, it is a fairly small establishment. There's maybe 7-8 tables only, to wait almost 25 mins to get a menu when the restaurant is half empty is poor service/too long of a wait time/signs of inadequate staffing.   She came to take our order. On the menu it says indicate level of spice. I said extra spicy and my friend said mild, she shook her head and just walked away. We were confused. Did she hear us? Did she understand what we ordered? Why did she shake her head? We gave her the benefit of doubt, and would wait to see.   Food comes out. Our orders are wrong: my food is mild, my friend's food is spicy.  So I asked the server for hot sauce, and the lady says \"no\" and motions her hand like she's telling us to go away and walks away. Unsure if she just didn't understand, we switched dishes bc it would be easier than dealing w the worst server ever. Soon after we asked for more water and one sprout appetizer and she did it again, saying \"NO\" more clearly, same hand gesture. Clearly she understood what we were asking. WTF. The restaurant is empty except us at this point. Not sure how she functions as a server and are flabbergasted at why ppl eat here. If it makes you feel better, there's a water cooler that you can get your own water from at the front if the restaurant.   - Mediocre food. The apps are flavourless. The fried fish is a nice touch but aggressively salty, we didn't eat ours. Our dishes weren't good. The seafood Soon tofu was minimal (one small shrimp, one mussel) and the dumplings are disintegrated in my friend's dish. We had the toasted dumplings and they were greasy, with huge air pockets after the meat. Half way into our dishes, she brings out our rice which is supposed to be served with the dish. At this point, we aren't surprised and just want to get this meal over with. I love Korean food and this was hardly up to standard. Korean food is substantially better in, quite literally, almost every way in other restaurants throughout the Annex and North York. I think the positive reviews may be coming from the fact that there are few Korean establishments in the area giving this place a bit of a monopoly. The food just is not good here. No way is this place worthy of a trip just to dine here.   Restaurant- outdated. In the middle of a strip mall type this. The kitchen, where they make the tofu, is absolutely filthy. I don't see how it could be sanitary. Especially considering their apparent lack of human resources in serving and in the kitchen. I saw one person in the back preparing the food. The bathrooms are tiny and it was rather dirty in there as well.   Overall, poor experience in food and especially service. I always try to eat at small establishments a few times before posting any review, and each experience was regretful. Very disappointed given all the good reviews and don't see where these reviews could come from."}
{"text":"Wow!  If you are on the hunt for some fresh tofu, this place is definitely it.  Their Soon Tofu here is super fresh and has a deliciously silky texture that sort of melts in your mouth.  We ordered the dumpling soon tofu, which came with purple rice, and these dumplings that could only be described as \"cute\".  Really savoury and delicious.  We also ordered a bibimbap which was fantastic.  No burnt chunks though.  (usually I like those!)  Meal came with a ton of little appetizers, including two fried fish, pickled bean sprouts, kimchi bok choy (very garlicky!), deep fried tofu in a sweet soy sauce and sesame, and pickled daikon.    They also sell tubs of tofu - the silken one for $3, firm for $2.    They have one person in the back cooking and one person waiting the tables - she was not super friendly but got the job done.    Beyond that, come for the great food.  What a great gem!"}
{"text":"Small-scale restaurant that serves possibly one of the best, if not the best tofu in the West Toronto region. Most of the main items on the menu are $10 or less, and they all come generously with several side dishes. Their trademark dishes are their tofu dishes (surprise!) and it is the choice that you can't go wrong with.   The Korean lady is the only server, and damn, she really works hard to take orders, serve the side dishes, main dishes, collecting payments etc. I had several small conversations with her and she seems to be very polite and cheerful all the time. Since she is the only server, the service can be slow at times (as other posters mentioned). That said, this is one of the few places where I do not mind tipping 20% or more for a small casual meal, simply for her awesome efforts to keep everything organized.  I found this little gem while randomly browsing for tofu restaurants in the Mississauga/Etobicoke area about a year ago. Since then, I have brought my friends, family, coworkers etc. to this place. Everybody loved it."}
{"text":"I've been here four times and have ordered the Soon Tofu Bowl with beef every time. I'm sure the other things they serve are great, but somehow I can't order anything else... It comes to the table piping hot and NEVER cools down. On a cold day, it's the best way to warm up. On a warm day, you end up a touch overheated... But always satisfied! So good. Can't wait for winter!"}
{"text":"When they say hole-in-the-wall and mom & pop, they must have been thinking of places like this.  It does seem like a one woman show although I caught glimpses of at least one elf in the kitchen.   I'm not sure why a place like this has teriyaki and katsu on their menus but my family decided on chicken teriyaki, beef teriyaki, chicken katsu and soon tofu.  The chicken katsu came out last and it seemed like it was smothered in a strong teriyaki sauce.  However, it was far better than my older son's chicken teriyaki whose chicken meat tasted weird to me.  I think the beef teriyaki came out fine.  I was sharing two dishes with my youngest and it was beef teriyaki/chicken katsu.  The chicken teriyaki was so inedible for my oldest that I wound up giving him the remainder of my chicken katsu.  This leaves the soon tofu which my wife ordered and enjoyed.  Since she's hardcore when it comes to Korean food, it must have been pretty good.  Some fish was provided but I honestly don't know why.  My wife and kids enjoyed it.   I couldn't help but admire the server's energy as she hustled plates off tables, cleaned tables, brought food, took orders, directed customers to tables and manned the cash register.  It is quite the sight and I enjoyed it as unintentional entertainment.  I think this place was another learning experience for me.  It teaches me again to order the proper things from places even when they offer the improbable."}
{"text":"Good Korean comfort food done in a traditional style.  Take your time eating.  the food is plentiful and steaming. its made to order so keep that in mind if you are in a hurry.  Will go again for sure."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while but everything was still the same. Even the price! 7.99 for soon dofu made of home made tofu with a tasty fried fish, still 4/5 just don't expect too much conversation with the lady owner /server unless ur a senior Korean lol"}
