{"text":"This place is wonderful. The owner is friendly and extremely passionate about his business. He loves what he does and it shows. For the buffet the spices are usually tamed down a lot, in comparison to individual orders. I definitely recommend this restaurant. Naan, coconut rice, and shahi paneer are a must have!"}
{"text":"It's no longer open, but I really enjoyed it. Good food at good prices. The service sometimes wasn't there but the value made it okay. Hope they open up again at a new location."}
{"text":"Had lunch buffet with 6 others today.  I only had the veggie dishes, which were quite good, not greasy.  I even enjoyed the daal, which is unusual for me. Owner/chef was very friendly, and accommodated the crowd's vegetarian request well. Location isn't ideal for us, but I'd seek it out again in future."}
{"text":"We love the garlic naan and butter chicken here. Best in calgary for sure. Quality ingredients and you can taste it. The vegetarian dishes are also very flavourful. Friendly staff and ample parking. My only complaint is the chairs aren't comfortable, so we usually just do take out since the food is so good!"}
{"text":"Only nearby place open when we wanted some Indian lunch on  Saturday. Seriously, THE ONLY place. That automatically gives them 2 stars. The other two are for good indian comfort food and friendly owner.  This isn't your fine dining experience but rather the neighbourhood friend's house you're always invited to whenever you want indian food. That's good enough."}
{"text":"Very underrated place; suffers from being in a bad strip mall on Centre St. The food is quite good. Their Butter chicken is very good, and their coconut rice, garlic naan and samosas were excellent, although their pakoras are so-so. But everything is quality made. Not the top place in the city, but if you have out-of-town friends who've never had East Indian, it's a safe choice.  Try their Lunch smorg. All you can eat for 15 bones."}
{"text":"This is a really lovely Indian restaurant in an unassuming strip mall. The owners are super sweet and gave us an extra appie and dessert no charge. I really enjoyed the food, we had the dinner for 2. Great value and we had enough to take home for lunch. I would recommend this for take out or a casual eat in atmosphere and you are supporting a hard working couple."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things or recommend enough people to The Spices. The owners are just wonderful genuine good people, and the food is out of this world incredible. If you like flavour but not spicy heat, you will have the most amazing taste festival go on in your mouth. Completely a diamond in the rough, the prices are fair, the lunch buffet changes daily with some items such as butter chicken remaining a constant to the spread. They offer takeout as well, and delivery.   Amazing food, amazing flavour, nice decor! It's my go to Indian food place!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery after coming to the lunch Buffet and it was even better than lunch. Everything is so fresh and so tasty. Only problem is I can't stop ordering! Best Indian I have had in Calgary and I have been to a lot of different places. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I ordered some samosas when they were first open. Found them very greasy they dripped everywhere! And I find there are very pricey!"}
{"text":"We've ordered take out here three times. We bought the combo for 2 for 29.99 which includes a few pakoras, veggie entree, butter chicken, saffron rice and tandoori chicken. The butter chicken is not very good, but saffron rice and their special paneer entree is very good."}
