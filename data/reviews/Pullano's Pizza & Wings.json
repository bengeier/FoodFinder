{"text":"I grew up in Glendale and my parents would have Friday Pizza night, where we would get take out from Pullano's. I now live within proximity of Manhattan and have access to really great pizza. I try to swing by Pullano's when I am back in town, and I have to say that that the pizza still holds up after all of this time. It's nothing like the New York style pizza, but it's always really good. They have a thick crust, with a house made tomato sauce (that at times can be on the sweet side). They have a tendency to overdo it with the cheese but it still comes together well. I think it's a testament to the fresh ingredients. Overall, the menu is expansive and does not disappoint. See you guys next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing antipasto salad!!! Pizza and wings fabulous!! Michelob ultra on tap, need i say more!! Gets a little crowded but worth it!!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to order pizza. We usually get it to go, but have eaten there on occasion. The staff is always friendly. My only complaint is that they make the breadsticks differently each time we order them so sometimes they are awesome and other times they are just okay. I've learned to ask for the pamesan breadsticks as they are the best!    If you have room for dessert, get the Pullookie! It's great!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 20 plus years no joke! I love everything about this place especially the wings. The happy hour specials here are the best you can find and they often have free pizza with purchase of a drink in the later afternoon. This place is Right were you wanna be with a large group of friends having a drink and a daily special of wings and pizza!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and wings! Great place to watch AZ sports"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and great. Portions are huge and prices are competitive.  I would definitely refer friends to this great place."}
{"text":"Great service, our waitress was busy but she still managed to be attentive and serve our needs. The pizza and wings deal is the bomb and the fries are legit! Their bar section is cool to hang out in, not too loud and their draft beer is great! Over all awesome experience, will be back!"}
{"text":"Went to their private Superbowl party. Paid 50 bucks for the party. Last year it was good, lots of swag and prizes and drink specials and only 40 bucks. This year with the price increase, no drink specials, no swag, and no door prizes. The halftime smorg was only a salad, three types of chicken wings, half cut sandwiches, and some pasta and a gross pizza that was really greasy. The best part was the chips and dip with with the mixed nuts provided as snacks and chips and salsa. The gross part was people smoking e cigarettes at the bar. For the 50 bucks that they charged was not only outrageous for what they served, I think in my opinion it was criminal. Shame on me for going back and thinking it would be better than last year. Normally the established restaurants want to better the experience from the previous years.  I will not be going back anymore. Will be spending my cash at other reputable established places. To bad, used to go for there for years. Never again.? To bad Yelp only says 1 star is the worst you can rate."}
{"text":"We returned to Pullano's for our usual order. The service was friendly, attentive, and prompt. The food was delicious, as always! We're so glad that our one not-so-great experience hasn't become the norm at Pullano's. We'll definitely be continuing customers!"}
{"text":"Pullanos is my absolute favorite place for pizza and wings. I take all of my family here and recommend this place to everyone. The wings are amazing, the pizza is huge and delicious. My favorite thing though is the Wisconsin cheese curds! Being from Wisconsin I give these 5 stars it tastes like home. Great environment and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Their pizza is pretty good but love their wings and their pastas! Great casual atmosphere and friendly employees. Great special Tuesday nights for BOGO half off entrees"}
{"text":"Dined there last night with family & friends, and I believe this to be the best pizza I've yet found in the Phoenix area. Wonderfully light yet chewy crust. Awesome (and, unlike the general population, that's not a term I use lightly) extra-crispy wings. Bit of a dive, I think, but if it offers pizza & wings of this quality, who cares? :-)"}
{"text":"Pretty good..costco style and flavor pizza. Fast service. Nice dark bar with big screen for games/sports..."}
{"text":"Wings are good but stopped going after they raised the price for the 2nd time. Nothing special anymore."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. The reason I say this is because I had gotten a coupon in the mail for their pizza and wings which I'm sure is heavily circulated because I get them once a month usually and I figured I would call and try it. Well I drive all the way over to pick up my pizza and wings and low and behold I get there and noticed that I forget my coupon so I ask them is it okay if I get my pizza and wings this time without the coupon I live about 5 miles away and didn't want to drive all the way back just to get a coupon so the girl told me NO. I have asked for a manager and a manager had came out and I asked her the same question only to get the same answer so I left without paying for my food which would have been an extra $10 because I had forgotten the coupon the manager knows if these are heavily circulated and could have gave me a pass but chose not to so for that reason I give it one star and I will never return to this place again"}
{"text":"First time at Pullano's.  My husband was raving about it and has been eating there for years.  We didn't eat in, we just ordered and went and picked it up.  We got an extra large pepperoni and sausage pizza, mild wings, my daughter got the buffalo chicken sandwich with fries and tiramisu for dessert.  The pizza was awesome, one of the better pizza's I have ever had.  However, my daughter and I were disappointed with the wings.  Although, they were good size and meaty there was no wing sauce on them and they were not very crispy at all.  It was like eating a \"naked\" wing, not our favorite.  The only \"sauce\" was this thin greasy like juice sitting in the bottom of the container.    The dessert was FANTASTIC!!!!!  After seeing in the menu that the tiramisu was imported by a family member from Italy I just had to try it and I was so glad that I did!  The tiramisu comes in a decent size cup and the cost is $4.99, but it is well worth it!   Even though our experience with the wings was not to good, I am willing to try them one more time and see if maybe it was a fluke and someone overlooked putting the sauce on the wings.  Overall, the food was great and we will for sure return to Pullano's in the future!"}
{"text":"rhia: food is delicious. service is sometimes lacking. it depends on which waitress and what her mood is. they also forget things that you tell them.  summer: the waitresses apparently all have to be memorizers. maybe the recession made paper hard to afford. they never write down what you order. today we ordered mild wings with honey bbq on the side; we got the opposite.  rhia: they have tasty 30 cent wings on mondays, however the purchase of a drink is stipulated. plus you get charged more than a buck for a side of sauce. for real?  summer: at two bucks for the drink, and three for the ten wing minimum, it's still a decent deal. only your mom is a better bargain.   rhia: fun atmosphere. laid back. and it's always busy, but not so busy that you have to wait long for a table.  summer: they like the buffalo bills and george bush. a lot. as seen plastered all over the walls. which is a fun setting for a table full of lesbians and our friend cindy. also they have italy place mats that are a good save if you're conversation gets that awkward lull in it.  rhia: uh. y-o-u-r.  summer: right right.  rhia: we're becoming monday night regulars for the cheap ass wings. but any other night, i'll pass.  summer: i like to feed the babies the pullookie, delicious pizza-cookie with ice cream, for dinner. (that's not true, i feed them prior to, i'm not that bad of a parent).  we agree: good for wings. we don't really eat the other food. we hear the salads are delectable. happy hour at the bar seems like a good bet also, but we really aren't happy hour sports bar kind of girls. believe it or not."}
{"text":"Delicious Veal Parmigiana!!! My parents go there all the time and ask for \"awesome Austin\" for their waiter.  Friendly, fast service, food tasted fresh!! Great family owned place."}
{"text":"This is our first visit. We had antipasto salad, wings, French fries with garlic and Parmesan cheese, garlic bread. Everything was very tasty. I would have liked more cheese on salad, but that's personal preference. The server was very attentive. We would definitely come back and make it one our regular places."}
{"text":"I'll put it this way.  I'm a tourist to this city.  When a local whom you trust with such questions tells me he goes here for late night booze and bites, I'm going.  Beer:  Cold, clean taps.  Have some.  Is the selection going to blow away my hipster pals?  No.  BUT, who's going to a perfectly dive-y place like this looking for hipster beer selection?  Booze:  Right down the middle.  Pouring fast and strong.  I. Like. It.  Now for the late night food:  They have free pop corn and pizza all night.  Let me say again.  Free: Pizza and popcorn.    Pool table: looks like it's been hit with a hammer a couple two three four(teen) times.  If you're cool with that and just want something to do while you eat free food and drink, then you're in for a great night.  Jukebox:  It's a fancy pants digital jukebox but you'll find all sorts of good drinking anthems and more.    Why would you not go here?  Because you prefer the sterile cavernous, loud, flashing light d-baggery that takes place near the stadium.  Let's be real if you're the type that really loves tucking into the Gordon Beirch horror show, I'm not sure you've got the stuff it takes to hang out here.  For the rest of you....cheers."}
{"text":"Love their wings!! Always friendly staff great local neighborhood hangout watch the game and relax..... Beware however if the Bills are playing your not going to find a seat until that game is over Lol Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Been going here for years. They literally have the best wings and pizza.  It's always great to support a good family owned business and this one is worth supporting for sure! Staff is always nice and helpful too."}
{"text":"Mike P. reached out to me to figure out what went wrong and did credit me back for the meal. A nice gesture of good faith and much appreciated. Good customer service goes a long way. We will continue our patronage at Pullano's!"}
{"text":"Pullano's is a great place to come and can accommodate a few different moods.  The restaurant is divided into two separate parts that contain both a bar and formal dining area. Both of which are great atmospheres to have lunch/dinner.   The food here is great and the pricing is reasonable. A couple of great items on their menu are the Baked White Ziti and Dessert Pulookie. Both are fantastic.   On our last visit I had the chance to try the Bacon Mac' N ' CheeseBurger. WAY too much food for me in a sitting but I can tell you it was out of the ordinary and it tasted amazing.  Top notch food here and a great place to bring family and friends. I always look forward to getting the opportunity to come down to this place. Kudos."}
{"text":"This is a great place been here for years.. very well-established  great reputation , excellent food , and great service"}
{"text":"Perfect, if you love getting home with a pizza that is cold and burnt and pulling a piece off to find hair in it!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza and wings. It was packed so my fiancé and I had to sit in the very back tiny corner. (Hostess asked if we minded, to be fair.) I've had better antipasta.. But the pizza and wings make up for that. Yum."}
{"text":"pullano's for lunch I always love to order pizza from this place never been disappointed. However there lunch sandwiches are pretty pricey. I must say use extreme caution they boast about how amazing everything is and I ate the worst cheese steak sandwich in my entire life! I'm not kidding I got a sample of a microwavable cheese steak sandwich at Costco and it blows pullano's cheese steak out of the water you're better off going and buying a roll from the deli department and getting the frozen box of steakums and make it yourself. Will never return again except to pick up pizza to take home! Pullanos you better check yourself before you wreck yourself. This was my third time coming back for your lunch specials and trying something different and again disappointed you make wonderful pizza everything else throw in the garbage."}
{"text":"I have heard some very good things about this place. recently went with my boyfriend and two other friends in...December? November? So the pizza...delicious. The cheese poppers..whatever they are called are the best part, in my opinion. I will return in the future. The cheese popper appetizers are what will make me return to Pullano's. These mom and pop restaurants/retail stores put the chains to a shame. This is one of those mom and pop restaurants."}
{"text":"Friendly service, good food and nice drink specials.  Free pizza Thursday nights."}
{"text":"Pullano's has absolutely great wings. I visit them on almost a weekly basis and i'm always happy with the food."}
{"text":"We happened in here last night twice. First ordered a to go order for our daughter and son in law to take to the hospital after they had their baby. Then we went back for dinner ourselves. Simply, great service, comfortable atmosphere and good food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place has very mediocre food.  the drink specials are the only thing worth coming for. It seems like the servers are treated poorly."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years. The menu is very vast. The service is great. My husband loves the lasagna my daughter and I like the bruschetta. I also think they have some of the best wings I've had. I like the mild jerk wings"}
{"text":"Gag. Gag and a half. Not only was the food pretty gross, the experience itself was ridiculous.   Let me just start by saying that my husband really are very laid back people. We both HATE to complain about food. Neither of us are extremely picky. I promise I am not that person that complains constantly about places.   This place came highly recommended from my boss, who is in love with their food. She talks about it all the time. My husband and I were craving some Italian, and I suggested we go here. The exterior itself looks pretty shady, but sometimes hole in the wall places end up being amazing. Not the case here.    We sit down and review the massive menu. My husband sees that they are doing $0.40 wings. He decides to do that. When the waitress comes to take our order the following stipulations were explained if he wanted to take advantage of the deal  -You can only get 1 flavor. (ok, I guess that is not that big of a deal) -You must order a soda (annoying...but whatever) -You can't leave the restaurant with them. She literally told him \"If you don't eat all your wings, we are going to throw them away. You can't take them with you.\" (Extremely annoying, petty, and wasteful) OK fine. I will get the wings and stick to your stupid rules. And then this happened:  Waitress \"Ranch or Blue Cheese?\" Husband \"Can I try one of each?\" Waitress \" well, you can only have one per order....I mean I guess I can do that for you, but I have to charge you extra for it\"  Seriously? I tried to stifle my laughter, but the entire wing conversation had been so obnoxious, it was laughable. It would be one thing if she was nice and was just trying to follow the rules, she was pretty rude.   OK so my husband gets his order of wings in, after agreeing to the \"wing laws\". I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. Safe choice. Not. My meal came with soup. Meh. Nothing great. The food comes, the wings are decent. I laughed again when I saw the spaghetti.  I am not exaggerating  when I say that it was noodles, on top of tomato soup with microwaved meatballs on top. Yum! My husband looked at my plate with a \"wtf\" face. We took a picture of it because of what an amazing failure it was. My husband said \"The only time I have seen spaghetti like that is when I try to make it at home.\"    I'm pretty sure the waitress knew that it looked nasty. It was a drop and run. We didn't see her again for 20 minutes. I eventually flagged her down and sent the food back. My husband asked if I would like to share some wings with him. We order another small order of wings. They were again, just ok. I ordered the raspberry chipotle wings, they tasted like bottled BBQ sauce. Nothing amazing. When we finished our food, we waited another 15 minutes for someone to notice us. 3, yes 3 waiters walked right by us. It was obvious that we were done. Their were napkins on both plates and we were just sitting there. One waiter walked by twice.  And we still sat there. Finally our waitress came back took a couple dishes and disappeared again. They must have a freaking amazing break room or something. The best part was when I turned around to see if any employees could come rescue us, and a big group of wait staff are standing in one little spot watching the game. mmmk. cool. We'll just wait til you are done there.     So lets review, bad service, awful food, bad location, wing laws. No thanks. It would be one thing if you had amazing wings, but the wings are just average. They are neither here nor there. I would rather go to Native New Yorker's for wing night. They don't care how many ranches you want. haha  EDIT: After this was posted, I received a viscous, profanity filled response from a stranger who was apparently HUGELY insulted that I didn't like a trashy restaurant that he considers a 5 star establishment. So I share my bad experience on a website that was created to keep others in the know and I get attacked with insults and derogatory comments? So guess what Pullano's, I just dropped a star on my review. You are disgusting and so are your loyal patrons."}
{"text":"without regoing to this place i will raise my rating based on what Ive heard from others who are fans of their food. When I attended the pizza seemed to be popular, staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Great pizza, probably some of the best I've ever had. They're specials are unbeatable. They're wings are good but the bone-ins had a couple deformities which I hate (broken bones, weird shapes, etc). The sauces are good so I usually just get boneless wings. All in all, not a bad place to catch Sunday night football."}
{"text":"We love the wings and pizza at Pullano's! The wings are crispy and delicious and the pizza sauce has great flavor."}
{"text":"I have to say that Pullano's Pizza is one of the best places to get pizza and wings in Glendale. They give you so many toppings to choose from and a huge variety of wings as well. The service and atmosphere is pretty good, and they keep the bar and dining area separated so you can bring the whole family. I highly recommend the place if you are in the area and want to have a few drinks, and eat lots of delicious pizza and wings."}
{"text":"We love coming here. Pizza and wings are great! The daily special they have for the wings and pizza is a decent price too. You have to try the pickles in the jar. My mouth is watering as I write this. The hot pickles are tasty."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago and haven't been able to find a descent pizza joint since I moved to AZ. This place has to be the best pizza place in Arizona. I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza which was sooo delish! Very fresh, crispy,and flavor was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Been a patron of this place for over 20 years ....best pizza and wings in the valley !  Always a priced right happy hour in the bar and if your timing is right a pizza or two will be brought out .... Owner Mike is a great guy and does what it takes to earn your business .... If youve never been its a must ...pizza and wings will blow you away !!"}
{"text":"First time and it was good. Our waitress was attentive and the food was great.  Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Best hot wings in town.  I love their blue deessing.  Yummy.  Fun place to go watch sports!"}
{"text":"I've definitely had better pizza. I ordered half peperoni/pineapple & half combo. Like others have said, the toppings DO fall off. Even the pineapple was falling off which shouldn't happen... The mushrooms on the combo side were from a can in water. They were pure white and floppy; I picked them off. The pizza was Extremely greasy, like overly greasy. The crust tasted similar to Domino's. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Overall, this place is alright and gets the job done. Pizza and wings are their specialty and I can't really find a reason to criticize! Well, save for a couple of key points...  I found the sauce on the wings very watery and fluid rather than viscous and sweet, It gave the wings a very slimy texture in my mouth that just didn't feel right. I'm hoping that that was just a fluke on their part.  Ordered a supreme pizza. The ingredients on it were a mixed bag. The usuals, veggies, pepperoni, mushroom. Oooh shout out to the mushrooms which were actually very very good! And finally, the pizza dough was baked extra crispy so every bite had a satisfying crunch sensation that's so easy to rave about! =)  Also, I hear this place has killer happy hour specials and I'll be back I'm sure eventually and hopefully I can bump this place one star up if they redeem their wings!"}
{"text":"by far a very family oriented Buffalo Bills Bar  We have been there a few times. The Super Bowl Party was fantastic and truly made the Day    Great wings.  Pizza.  Chili.  I cannot thank them enough for making this Day Magical.    Thank You for the Great Thyme"}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings in town.  Love the \"suicide wings\" and the antipasto salad is out of this world."}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious and cheesy !! Yummy , were defiantly coming back when ever were craving pizza and wings .. Wings were crispy and really saucy loved them.."}
{"text":"I love this place! I am a weekly customer here. The food and service is always exceptional especially Stacy. She is always my server and delivers prompt service with a smile every time. Sometimes the kitchen gets a little backed up and you have to wait a little while to get your order but sometimes you have to wait a little extra for perfection. Even with a delay every now and then I'm always informed of the status of my order and my drink always stays full. I'd give pullanos 10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in the valley. If I had to pick up my kids from daycare or get pizza from here, my kids would understand my choice on putting them 2nd. #fact"}
{"text":"It's hard to find places that have a fun atmosphere but also have delicious food that makes us come back each and every time. We have been going here since I was a kid and now I take my kids. The owners are great and the specials are sweet! :)"}
{"text":"We get take out from here at least once a week. Love the buffalo chicken salad, pear blue cheese salad, Italian wedding soup, cheese burger, and pizza. You get plenty of food for price. Great people that care about their customers!"}
{"text":"This place is a great neighborhood bar with a separate side for the restaurant. It's also family owned which is always a plus in by book!   I've been here too many times to count and have tried over half of their menu. They have the best wings! I like mine pretty hot and I still go with medium here. Their antipasti salad is a must try, with the house Italian dressing. My least favorite thing on the menu is actually the pizza. It's pretty good, just not one of my favorites. All of their pasta dishes are good and I love their soups.   And for dessert, don't miss the pullokie!!!"}
{"text":"was in last night for my wife's birthday and the food was delicious like always.  The owner came out to wish her happy birthday on his own birthday as well!  Pullanos is always a great choice for Italian.  There is a reason this establishment has been here for many years."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great place to meet up with friends & hang out. Picture of draft beer was kind of price. Pizza is a little greasy but no more than rays or other similar places. Wings are really good but they are $1 a wing. They do offer specials, look for those :)"}
{"text":"Use to love Pullano's but the quality is really bad. It's never busy and they don't care about the food they provide to their customers. Truly sad."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years. All of the waitresses are wonderful and MR. Pullano and his wife are some of the nicest and most respected business owners i have ever met. Great prices on beer and food and a fun neutral place to hang out. PS THANKS FOR THE ITALIAN DRESSING ITS AMAZING"}
{"text":"I had never heard of Pullano's before tonight and decided to try this place out because we had a great value coupon.  My fiance loved the spaghetti and the meatballs were really good. The pizza however was just OK. It had an odd sauce that was too salty, although it wasn't necessarily bad. The bread sticks were nothing to get excited over.  The restaurant itself looked like a lot of fun, but we ordered take-out. We decided that this place was a little expensive for what it was and it probably isn't somewhere we would go without a coupon."}
{"text":"Where do I start, four star average for this dump, I think not. old and dirty is my impression of this restaurant and the pizza was terrible and undercooked to the point of soggy raw dough in the middle and no flavor, it been 10 year's since iv tried this place and now I remember why, they did gain 1 star for the wings being cooked right and way better than the pizza, that said we will never be back, what a waste of $23"}
{"text":"Nice place with good food. We also ordered takeout and the portions were pretty large. Their pizza is done right, though the sauce has a rather bland taste to it - noticed it the last couple time we ordered - but not bland enough to not order again.  Overall, we don't think of this place first when contemplating the type of fare they offer, but we do visit periodically. I enjoy my experience when visiting this establishment and would recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times and absolutely love this place. I've never had a bad meal here and the wings I would argue are the best I've had in the valley. They are always cooked just the way I like them (super crispy on the outside but not dried out on the inside) and they have this Italian Dry Spice that I can't get enough of. Other favorites include their thin crust pizzas and a hot Italian sandwich that can literally feed two people.   They have awesome drink specials too! My wife and I would always go on Sundays because it was dollar drafts on everything! I don't believe this is valid during football season but prior to that I was there consistently every week. Oh did I mention free nacho bar on Sundays?!?!   Definitely a place I recommend and go to every chance I get!"}
{"text":"This place has AMAZING wings!!!  I was never a big wing fan, but this place helped me turn a corner in my love for hot chicken wings.  Both the bone in and bone out are DELISH.  OH WOW.  We live in California and have family in Phoenix.  During every visit this place is at the top of the \"to do\" list.  The pizza is okay - my husband is an East Coast native so he has shown me real pizza heaven and this is not that.  But the wings.........wow.....yum."}
{"text":"We order here a couple weeks ago but didn't have time to write a review. But I was highly disappointed first thing is there is a menu online that they said wasn't there menu even though it has your address and your phone number which was highly disappointing cause it has very different pricing that I am pretty sure you have to honor but didn't feel like arguing about it. Then when i went to pick up the order not one of your many servers standing around talking to each other bothered to greet us. Stood in line for 10 minutes before one of your chatty servers decided to walk over and finally help us. Even if they weren't there to help us one of them could have said \" I am really sorry about the wait and the take out person is busy gathering another order\". I have worked in customer service for 10 plus years. So I would just say the service was just awful. It takes 2 seconds from their socializing to just acknowledge a paying customer. Just overall dissatisfying especially for the price."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while, but have to say returning was like finding an old friend.  Great deal with a coupon, but kind of pricey otherwise(that is for people like me on a budget).  Had the Pullano's Special (about $25) and some wings (40 for around $23).  Also had the large cheese pizzas ($12.99 w/ coupon)  Great food, energetic atmosphere, definitely a great place to grab a slice and watch a game.  We were in a party of 7 and I almost double tipped.  Didn't see that added 18% gratuity until after signing the receipt, so if you've had a few BEWARE."}
{"text":"The pizza is good and the wings are above average.   The decor is very cheesy and the space seems to be crammed.  This place has a decent wing deal on Mondays and Thursdays.  30 cents a wing with purchase of drink.  You must be able to eat at least 15-20 wings a person in order for the deal to be worth it."}
{"text":"The best pizza and wings ! And the lasagna? Best ever!  My Italian mother claims it's the most authentic she has tasted. Come hungry. The service is wonderful and friendly. Makes me feel like I'm coming to their home instead of their restaurant. Thanks for the high standards of service and food.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Great variety of wings between sauced & dry rubbed which you don't see often.  The Tomato Garlic Cheese crisp is delicious if you want to stay on the lighter side instead of ordering a pizza but don't get me the pizza is amazing too! Staff is super nice and attentive"}
{"text":"I dont know how this place gets all the rave.   We had a waitress named Kaley.   she came to our table twice to see how we were doing and i felt that that was a burden.  She was awful... We ordered  fried mushrooms and they were awful.   Overdone and very dark.  We sent them back.  Then we ordered the wings half garlic parm.   half medium sauce. The garlic pharm had no flavor what so bland.  The medium spice wings  were ok.  She brought celery and carrots and they looked like they were 2 weeks old.  Very dry.  Now the pizza.  We ordered the alffedo sauce.  My friend ask no mushrooms and they had put on mushrooms.  The chicken was very dry and there was no alfredo sauce.  I hate to give bad review because I have heard everybody rave about this place.   To bad because  we love to frequent the mom and pops but we will never be back and I will not reccomend this place 60 dollars down the drain"}
{"text":"All kinds of Happy Hour Specials. On Thursdays, you get free pizza for Happy Hour, What! That's right free pizza! On Monday's you get $0.40 wings. Get their wings extra crispy. Marty is an awesome Bartender. keeps the drinks flowing."}
{"text":"I grew up a couple of blocks away from Pullano's, and I still live nearby.  My family is from Buffalo, so Pullano's pizza has been our go-to pizza place my entire life. They used to deliver, but it's still worth driving over for a pick-up.  The Giant slice lunch special is awesome. The wings are fantastic and the pizza is something I craved while I was living abroad.  The owner is usually in the building, and they even provide homemade sweets during the holidays.  There is free pizza in the bar after 10pm, and it's worth it, but it goes fast. It's a small bar and it usually contains a a few rowdy people. but since it's in walking distance of my house, it's a place I love visiting.  I've only ever had a couple of things besides pizza and they were all great - but the pizza and wings are what they are known for.  With football season upon us, make sure you wear your favorite team jersey when you visit, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ok so I had a beer here several years ago. Didn't think much about it since. Tonight I stopped for dinner. The food is great, service is great. Try the Italian sub, wings, pizza you can't go wrong. They have been in business for years and know what they are doing. Just cool to see local ownership keep it going this long. The menu is quite large and I look forward to coming back to try more of it!!"}
{"text":"Visiting the Glendale area, I wasn't sure what to expect.  But this had the best reviews out of the Sports Bars in the area, so it got our business, and did not disappoint. The service was excellent, as were the pizzas and beer. One thing I thought was very cool is that one area is the \"restaurant side,\" and the opposite area is the \"sports bar\" side, so no matter what kind of evening you're looking for, it seems like Pullano's is a great place to try out."}
{"text":"Pullanos is a iconic landmark when it comes to pizza and wings on the west side! I've been coming here for years and always am pleased! They have since added a bar on one side, which has a nice neighborhood feel to it, and has tons of tvs to enjoy the games. Plus everything including drinks is very reasonably priced. Pullanos now has it all! Why go to some bar and pay a ton for overpriced bar food when you can come to Pullanos and get the best pizza and wings in phx!"}
{"text":"We went for our first visit , today, to watch the Super Bowl!  We had a blast! Everything was well organized, the food was awesome, and the staff amazing.  Thank you for a great experience, Pullano's,   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Having recently moved to the neighborhood, I'm on the prowl for a new pizza place. I was looking for one that delivered, but Pullano's is close enough for pick up, and I read good things about it, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I probably should have stuck with pizza. But we were in the mood for a full, homestyle meal. We ordered a veal parmesan, a chicken parmensan, two wedding soups, and a burger for the kid.   The fact that they had burgers should have been a minor warning sign. The fact that they also have a full Mexican food menu should have been a great big honkin' neon sign.  Like most places in the Valley, Pullano's is tucked in a shabby strip mall. Inside, it's very cheery and friendly. The walls are chocked full of sports memorabilia from the local teams they support, as well as some knickknacks, and TVs airing sports. It's been around a while, and that made it rather comfortable and neighborhoody.  The staff was all smiles, and after a short wait, had my food ready to go. The price for our meal was around $30. Not bad.  Once I got it home and unwrapped it, well, yeah. The veal parm was one of those chopped and re-formed patties, dowsed in a bland tomato sauce, and topped with mozzarella. The chicken was an actual chicken breast, served in the same way, but had the texture of a dog's chew toy (not that I've actually tried one.)  On a bright note, the italian wedding soup was really rather good. In fact, we have toyed with the idea of ordering from Pullano's again -- but just soup and garlic bread. Or maybe a pizza."}
{"text":"Eat at or order from Pullanos's regularly. Love the wings and pizza. You can't go wrong eating here! The wait staff is great and they have great eat-in specials."}
{"text":"I live near and go to this place often as well as get take out.  The food there is good and I just tried for the first time, cheese curds. They are delicious. But recently when I went in to eat lunch I was informed that they had a new menu and they no longer serve the giant slice. This in my opinion was a staple of pullanos. I feel there are other pizza places that I will give a try. Hopefully they read this and bring back the giant slice."}
{"text":"OK,  Mike, you're awesome, thanks for doing it again. Spaghetti was way better this time."}
{"text":"Great, sloppy wings and  good pizza. Nice staff.  I'll be back. Happy hour is wonderful.  Pretty much free beer.  Lol"}
{"text":"I'm so shocked by all the 5 star reviews about the food here. This place was lauded to me for weeks by a friend, and I was under the impression it was some sort of pizza institution a kin to Pizza Bianco. Alas, it is not.   So we put in an order for take out; wings and a large pizza for $27. A bit steep, but I was told it was good...  I've had outstanding pizza, I've had the less-than-memorable, standard issue pizza, and I've had truly bad pizza. Pullano's certainly falls into the last category.  Cheese was cheap; entire top of the pizza was covered in a slick of oil, a sure sign of budget ingredients. The sauce had zero flavor. And the crust. Wow. Got the thin crust, and although it wasn't chewy, which is always a plus, that was all it had going for it. Soggy, flacid, flavorless. Seemed under cooked and I was underwhelmed.   I could only stomach one slice, because after that, the roof of my mouth felt like I had just taken a swig of 90 weight gear oil. So greasy.   The wings were passable. Semi-crispy, but swimming in a sauce that was 90% oil and 10% red goo. Real let down here, too.  It's not hard for a bar to turn out a solid pizza, like Santisi Brothers. And I know bars that make exceptional pizzas, like Brown Dog in Telluride. But Pullano's is churning out a product that is better measured against Little Caesars than a real restaurant.   Flock here if you love oil and tasteless carbs. But avoid if you like good pizza, as there's plenty of better choices in town. Papa John's does a better forgettable pizza than Pullano's at a much more reasonable price."}
{"text":"I am originally from pittsburgh and this place has the ambiance and food that reminds me of home.   The pizza is good but I absolutely love the dry jerk cajun wings.   I like their subs too."}
{"text":"Just get on hither. It's a staple in the neighborhood of Glendale AZ. check out Bonitas restaurant also"}
{"text":"We've been here a lot. This is our go to for pizza and wings. We drive 12 mile to get to this place and we pass lot of pizza and wing restaurant and there a reason for that. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bruschetta is the best in town as advertised. Cheese curds, wings, pizza and Beer what more could anyone ask for. If you love good food and good times then this is your place."}
{"text":"Delishious food, the wings are the best in the valley, great service. Family atmosphere. Many TVs. The Bills home  team hang out for sure. Pool table. ATM."}
{"text":"Mike just let me know they have updated their beer menu to include some more craft options including Barrio brewing!  Pullanos rocks!  Can't wait to come and see the list.   Thanks Mike!"}
{"text":"I've been here too many times to count. Amazing food, good service(can be slow if they are packed) and good drinks. Havemt been there in a little while. Maybe it's time to take a trip back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great lunch of wings and pizza. Service is always great. Food is always spot on raspberry chipotle wings and Pullanos special is my go to."}
{"text":"Fun night meeting new people with my fiancé.  We had a fun group of karaoke going on!  I hope the lady that fell and bumped her head is okay.  You never want to see the EMT's wheeling someone away. :-("}
{"text":"Love it here.  The food is ALWAYS good and the staff is nice.  The resturaunt is ALWAYS clean.  I appreciate that they have sugar free tea too.  Awesome beers on tap."}
{"text":"The pizza was very good, not soggy or greasy. Hot wings were crispy and spicy. Something must of changed to cause this improvement. The only thing was the waiter. he was slower than molases in January!  Also screed up our order. Never checked on us while we ate to find out if we needed anything. So my husband and I shared a glass of water. Not like the place was busy either. We'd go back but we won't use the same waiter."}
{"text":"Coming from NYC it's been a struggle to find a reasonably priced Italian meal  that's decent and edible without going broke. I live in this area and find the food at Pullano's to be very good tasting and the portion size is a good value. The wings here are also top notch and for a local joint  ya can't beat it."}
{"text":"My first time here and let me tell you- it was delicious! my boyfriend and i sat in the bar and watched the yotes game. We ordered 2 beers, nice selection of drafts, and pizza & wings. it was the best pizza & wings i've had in a long time. the pepperoni and jalepeño pizza was so cheesy & spicy- all you need in life, and the hot wings & hot jerk wings were crispy and delicious! service was great, very attentive & quick! will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's ok. Love their antipasta .. Wings are good..sauce on pizza is a little too thick for me"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for YEARS! they have great wings, cheap beer and a dive bar vibe that is easy to chill in. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"The best bar and Italian restaurant bar none pizza is good chicken wings are the best and 16 oz draft beer is 99 cents Monday thru Friday 11 to 2 including some premium beers it truly is a hidden gem"}
{"text":"Mmmm... ok so my fave pizza joint in Az has always been Pizza Factory in Buckeye, but when I moved back to Peoria I wasn't driving all the way out there.  My boyfriend, a HUGE Bills fan said let's go to Pullano's I was skeptical at first being a Giants fan lol.  But OMG they have the most amazing pizza and wings! Our go to every time is the Chipotle BBQ wings.  Super Yummy.  We go at LEAST once a month and I love it there.  The staff are super nice and it always feels homey there.  I went with him to watch a Bills game this last season and I'm not even afraid to admit it was fun!!! (We stayed to watch the Giant's game lol) Pullano's will always be our go to!  Great job guys and girls!... great now I'm hungry...hmmm maybe a Pullano's trip tonight..."}
{"text":"The garlic Parmesan wings here are so delicious I always like to split my wing orders half spicy half garlic Parmesan. The pizza is also delicious but hands down the wings are the best."}
{"text":"The Pizza is okay you can find better down the street at Rays. But the wing selection, good drink selection and the always lively bar section make this place worth going back to."}
{"text":"The most amazing pizza ever! Delicious fresh and non corporate . home made awesomeness! I will drive here from chandler and that's almost a good hours drive! Nice divey bar and chill atmosphere. I def wish it was closer ! If you are not sure of coming here, just do it...you will not regret it!!!!"}
{"text":"Great cheese pizza and wings combo. The pizza is good and the wings are excellent; either flavor hot wings and bbq wings.  Super casual in a dumpy strip mall. Football on tvs, kid friendly and a bonus if you are a buffalo bills fan as that is their home team"}
{"text":"I think I have decided Pullano's has made it in to my top 3 pizza places in AZ... It has all my favorites in a New York Style Pizza. The cheese is stringy and plentiful, the crust is crispy and sweet, and there are always tons of  toppings. I've also had the wings and cheese curds and both were also fabulous. It's hard to get good cheese curds anywhere in AZ. I'd say these are not the best I have had but they are pretty close. The wings are large, crispy, and always have tons of sauce, and tons of fun and delicious sauces at that. I always forget that they have really great weekly deals, so maybe look those up before you give them a try. They have a deal where you get a free personal Pizza with purchase of a beverage, a buy one get one 50% off Italian meal, and tons more. And if you are looking for a good dive bar there is one attached to the main dinning room that is always poppin."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite wing place with sardellas and cheezeheadz being a close second.    Wings are always fried to perfection while the sauces are generously applied.   The pizza here is great. Ive also tried the salads and sandwiches. Both are great. Fresh ingredients with awesome taste.    I've taken friends here and they are always wanting to go back."}
{"text":"I'm fairly new to Arizona and would never have known about Pullano's if not for an ASU classmate. I've now been there several times with friends, and all in all, I love the place. It's perfect for unwinding after work or school. The drinks are strong and fairly priced and the food is pretty decent too. One tip though, don't try ordering any fancy drinks. This is not the place to order a mojito or an old fashioned. Stick to the basics and you won't be disappointed!   I think the best part about Pullano's is the service. The girls who work in the bar area are nothing short of awesome. They're friendly and attentive and never leave you wondering where your server went.   Also, the restaurant is divided into two parts: a dining room area and a bar area, so whether you're looking for a family dinner or a boozy night out with friends, Pullano's has what you need. Definitely a must-try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"The best pizza on the west side... 51st Ave and T-bird.  It's a Mom and Pop shop that I've grown up with... moved away, and happened to go back recently so I can review it. :)  They are still the same as always... the same red and white checkered table covers, the placemats of Italy...   And the friggen awesome wings and pizza.  Holy crap I had forgotten how good they were... and they are now offering other flavors of wings, like Garlic and Parmesan... altho the medium flavor does fine with me. :)  The pizza... it's floppy... it's greasy... the stuff falls off, but you can't help but just want to eat more.  ESPECIALLY when you get down to the crust. Their crust is AWESOME.  Another couple of cool things... they have1.50 coors lite during races, .99 beers during happy hour, and for those of us who are used to very expensive beers... their normal price is 2.75 for beers.  Bar that is attached has all day every day $2 drafts.   Service: in the beginning it was iffy... there was no smiling from this chick.  But she seemed to relax with us as the food was delivered and things went well.  So... if you want a local place to check out some wings, pizza and beer... go here."}
{"text":"We've just started coming here, and I'm consistently pleased with the service and the food. The pizzas are huge, my husband loves the wings but I order an entree and my boys get a kid's plate.   There's often a special going on and parking can be tight, so show up early!"}
{"text":"Still find Pullano's Pizza & Wings the most amazing place in Arizona!  Our family absolutely loves \"Friday Night - Movie Night\"  It wouldn't be the same without Pullano's  (Oh, their chef salad's are amazing!)"}
{"text":"Went there for take out pizza, it was decent. The staff was very nice and I will probably go there again, but nothing I would write home about. Average, but in their defense, all of my coworkers really love this place, which is why I went. The crust had no flavor and I like sweet tomato sauce. Maybe they offer it and I just have not tried it. My husband and I will go and eat there and I'm sure my opinion will change. I would like to try the wings."}
{"text":"Came here for their Wednesday night special, $5.99 for a large cheese pizza. Got here around 8 & were seated right away, they have plenty of TV's for watching the game.  Service was pretty slow but we weren't in a hurry. The pizza was GREAT! More like a pan pizza (thicker crust).  We had half leftover so we had dinner & lunch the next day for $6! Awesome! Their menu was huge & I noticed they had quite a few other weekly specials. Will be back next Wednesday :)"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place countless times, but never went in until a friend told me about the 99 cent beers and free pizza on Friday nights (after 10:00).  I was skeptical and was sure there was some sort of catch, but there really wasn't.  The place was packed and of course the free pizza probably isn't their 5 star best offering, but still a great place to start your Friday night (though we have accidentally stayed til close more than once).  The service is also great, our servers have always been attentive with us never sitting there with an empty glass.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Went there the the family, as we have for many years, and the service was outstanding. Pizza  and wings are great but the secret is the green Chile burrito and the pazzokie chocolate cookie ice cream deliciousness.  Great for families that want to watch a game, and have some great food at the same time.   You can even sneak over to the bar side and enjoy a completely different atmosphere."}
{"text":"To go pizza sausage, mushroom, olive, easy on the sauce extra cheese regular crust! Yummy!   Cheese curds ok!   Cinnamon knots, crazy amazing.... Ought to offer pecan cinnamon knots!   Happy campers here indeed!!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. We ordered the 30\" pizza after a family trip and the kids all raved about how delicious it was. Can't wait to try dine in next."}
{"text":"Pizza was cold upon delivery, chicken wings were very dry and pizza was not fully cooked, and we waited an hour to receive our food so I was expecting hot food. No manager on duty and was told to contact the owner who still won't return our calls and we got food poisoning   I will never eat here again"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying, I have been coming here since I was a kid. Small businesses are the best. But, as a long time customer, I have to say that the quality has kind of taken a downward turn. Last 3 times have had issues. One, pizza was burned. Had to have them remake. Second time, wings were extremely dry and the ranch was missing. This time, there was something funny about the dough. Maybe it rose too long? I don't know. But Pullanos you need to get it together. I'm tired of not loving you anymore."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.    Great pizza and wings and the bar has great drink specials.   Mike runs a good show"}
{"text":"Great food! Wonderful Service! Fun Atmosphere.  They graciously accomodated our large party at the last minute.  Our girls volleyball team had a great time."}
{"text":"Love their wing flavor selection. Miss the 40 cent wing night, but hey, it hasn't kept us away. My fav is hot garlic parmesan. The meatballs are humongous and wonderful. Great servers--ask for Deb."}
{"text":"Every time it's fantastic. I really enjoy when we get there pizza and wings. Pizza crust is always perfect. Love the Italian large pizza buy a large get a medium free. You cant go wrong. Garlic bread is great too"}
{"text":"I love the pizza and boneless wings were awesome. I love the ranch dressing they got it right.  Service was excellent. I miss this place and will remember to come back."}
{"text":"This Is one of my favorite places to go, not only is it super close to me but it has the best pizza I've had lately. The appetizers are good as well as the wings and the drinks are fantastic. I love going there to watch games."}
{"text":"Wednesdays 5.99 large cheese . Nothing beats this. They are delicious too. Non busy times it only takes them 10 minutes. Ranch is to die for as well. Great place."}
{"text":"This pizza place reminds me of my childhood in the burbs of Chi-town.  It's a warm and friendly place to be with multiple TVs blaring the current football game, patrons and fans cheering with every touchdown and piping hot pizza right from the oven! They even have 2-4-1 meal nights!   This is the place for your pitcher of bud and your favorite team jersey,  Oh, and don't worry, no need to dress up or find yourself a baby sitter."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go! They have great friendly service! Delicious food! And they always have a smile on their faces!! Good variety of food but not too overwhelming! You can also call ahead for a pick up order! The wings are to die for! And the pizza tastes perfectly homemade from fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"This place is great! They have the best wings and I love that the veggies are extra fresh. As a kid my best friend her parents (a wonderful Italian Family) used to come here a lot and used to get to go orders. Their pizza is amazing now as a mother and wife I take my husband pizza and wings from here all the time.  The family owned restaurant is awesome they definantly appreciate the men and women in the service!  GREAT JOB PULLANO'S!"}
{"text":"Good Food. Great Mom and Pop Sports Bar."}
{"text":"I have been a patron of Pullano's Pizza for as long as I can remember. My parents took us there as kids and we still go as adults. Family owned and operated and the food is very good! Throughout the week, Pullano's has amazing specials, so depending on your likes, family size, budget- there is something for you. I recommend the Pullano's Daily Special wit an XL pizza and 40 wings! So delicious- you can feed a family of 5-6 easy on this special. :)"}
{"text":"Great staff. People here are just wonderful, they really care about the experience and want you to enjoy your time in their restaraunt.  The food... not sure what to say. On the verge of being great. From what I hear, used to be, but from my point of view, not now. They use great ingredients, no doubt. They spend money on the food, so good on them. Execution needs some help. Everything is either just over cooked or barely undercooked. Maybe make the BOH a little happier, IDK. Something isnt right there.  Beer a restaraunt doesnt make."}
{"text":"Best Pizza and Wings in the valley hands down!! There is best of both worlds with having a split format.. if your looking for good time, hanging out watching games the bar is great for that. If your there for family time or a date, the dinning room is a great choice.. overall love this place!"}
{"text":"I literally come here almost every Wednesday with my girls. I love their wings, pizza, Or any of the appetizers. As being a foodie and a pizza enthusiast, I love this pizza, it is extremely good. The staff is always very friendly, they remember me every time I come in and if I don't bring my girls they asked me where my girls are. A real family oriented place. I will keep coming here for years to come and hope that one day my kids will bring thre kids here. Best pizza in Phoenix in my Opinion."}
{"text":"Yep, this place is just OK.  We ordered carry out while visiting the area.  The dude taking the order didn't know the menu.  Yeah I said dude cause he sounded like a dude.  Not sure what that means but it sounds right.  He was pretty oblivious.  We ordered enough to feed a small army and the service was super fast for how much we got.  We ordered hot wings(not hot), spicy honey bbq wings(not spicy) and garlic parm wings(ok).  The fried pickles were overcooked and the pepper jack cheese sticks were good but I was thinking they would be better.  The pizza was nothing to really remember.  The best part was the nice airy crust.  I would probably try this place again since there menu is huge.  I would just try some different entree's and apps.  Unfortunately I wasn't impressed with the pizza or wings but maybe the other food is worth talking about."}
{"text":"If you come here, you've got to try the wings!! They're extra crispy without asking for them that way and absolutely yummy. They have a huge menu though we stick to the same things usually pizza wings and beer. Good selection of cold beer on draft.   Very very relaxed atmosphere, older restaurant/bar. Plenty of tvs in the bar."}
{"text":"Free pizza in the bar is real good. Front of the house is all ladies and they are absolutely wonderful! On Wednesday, 3-6 there's a free taco bar"}
{"text":"My confidant and I returned to Pullano's because we wanted to pregame night class (completely necessary). Our experience was much better this time around.   We were under considerable time constraints and our waitress was more than accommodating. She let us order four drinks at once, and she let us pay upfront instead of making us wait for our bill.   I was much more pleased this time around, and I hope that our experiences continue to remain positive."}
{"text":"Pullano's is my favorite bar/hang out in the area.  I used to live across the street so it was awesome to be able to walk across the street, drink more dollar pints than you could count (they're 2 dollars now, but still a steal), and get free pizza.  The pizza is great (not the best in Phoenix, but authentic greasy goodness), and the wings are AWESOME (don't miss 40 cent wing night on Mondays).  As mention in another review the owner is there much of the time, he's even thrown a few bucks in the juke box and let me choose the music.    If you went to Maryvale HS or Moon Valley HS be sure to be at the reunion nights that the owner hosts, as they're bound to be better than the real thing.  Be sure to check out all of the specials: http://www.pullanos.com/"}
{"text":"This is definitely a sport's bar. Laid back atmosphere, nice waitstaff. TVs everywhere with all kinds of sports on. I have a buy one get one free dinner coupon from dine4az.com. Waitress was happy about it, didn't get all rude like waitresses usually do when handed a coupon. My boyfriend got spaghetti and meatballs, I had lasagna. The portions were HUGE. You could easily share a dinner with someone. The lasagna was average, not great, not bad. I tried a piece of the meatball, it was very good. I would've rather had that. Meatball was juicy, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. Overall good experience. I heard they were known for their pizza and wings, so next time I will be trying that."}
{"text":"walked in thinking i would simply order a pizza to go. WRONG!! after being greeted by shelby, i bellied up to the bar, ordered a beer, ordered my pizza, and then ordered spicy chicken dingers while i waited. best way to end a friday, i think. thanks, pullano's!!"}
{"text":"Let's call a spade a spade; there's really not that much that separates Pullano's from any of its competition, of which there is plenty. There's a Hungry Howie's down 51st street, a Ballpark Pizza on Thunderbird, Pizza by Napoli in the opposite direction on T-bird, and a Domino's practically across the street.   They all make pizza. They all make hot wings. They will all make your intestines hate you.  What sets Pullano's apart from the others is the atmosphere. Pullano's is a fun place to be. There are giant TVs all over the place, blaring whatever sporting event is going on. The walls are covered with team paraphernalia and the occasionally offensive but amusing show of patriotism (like a picture of an F-16 with a guy on a magic carpet shopped in).  Pullano's is the perfect place to bring large groups of people. The staff  seems to even prefer the larger groups, probably because they tip better.   The menu has lots of specials that cater to large tables. Depending on the day, you can get two for one pizza deals or a large with 30 wings.   The wings are a little on the crispy side, but you never get the wimpy little \"mini wings\" that places like Buffalo Wild Wings or Domino's try to screw you with when you order large batches.   The pizza's chock full of grease, but it's filling and tastes pretty damn good. I recommend the Chicken Alfredo pizza if you ever get a chance. On Wednesdays it's two for one, last I checked.  I'm sure there's other stuff on the menu, but I wouldn't bother. It's a pizza place.   There's a reason why nobody buys tacos at Burger King."}
{"text":"I came here with my man and our 3yr old and the waitress hit on my fiance. But hey the food was bomb, maybe next time we can get a free pizza ;)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Awesome food, great drink selection. Day or night the place is good. If your looking to just grab some pizza or drink some beers they have a bar side if your trying watch the game and okay pool or have a late night drink with your friends. I go here all the time for drinks cause it's right across the street from my place and it's cheap beer. Also bartenders are always super nice or cool! Have a jukebox you can play your own music so that's pretty sweet too!"}
{"text":"We arrived very late in the evening and decided to call PH at almost 9PM to order a pizza because we were starving. But as luck would have it they were out of Chicken, Pineapple, Onion, Bell Pepper, Pepperoni and Beef. Really PH? Really? So I called the front desk and they suggested we try Pullano's. We did, and I am happy that we did so. We did a special order half chicken half meat lover's, some wings and a salad. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"Pizza, wings, and salads are always amazing! Such a great alternative to chain pizza company's a little on the expensive side. Every time we order from here it's always $60 but the quality is unbeatable so well worth it"}
{"text":"I went here with my family and it was a good to time. We watch the Cardinals lose it in he last seconds, but the food made up for it.   We got half BBQ and half medium wings. Both were very very good. The BBQ was pretty much drenching the wing which is exactly how I like it    The pizza was about what I expected. Nothing to write home about but nothing to complain about.   If you are looking for a reason to come here just know that their cups are MONSTER sized. When we ordered soda and water they came in these \"we dare you to ask for a refill\" size that I think is awesome. I wish every place had cups these size."}
{"text":"The bar is separate from the restaurant.  I was in the bar and man, did it get rowdy.  The food was good.  Great selection of booze.  Friendly service.  The place could use some serious cleaning though."}
{"text":"Aghh..good ol College days at ASU West..Pullano's really helped with those 3 hour longg classes...I mean..how can you beat free pizza and dollar PBR's? This place is amazing to get a good pre class buzz on..but dont get your hopes up cuz unfortunately the monotonic instructor will eventually kill the buzz"}
{"text":"Not a fancy place great pizza and wings.... I was very skeptical but Pullanos's pizza delivered 4 out of 5 easy."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a little kid and the quality of the food is the best! I brought family from Seattle here and they were kind of skeptical until they saw the food, their eyes got all big at the way it looked and they said there were the best wings and pizza they've ever had when they've come to visit us. They defiantly want to come here again the next time they visit. They get jealous of the pics I post of the food I get now that they're back home"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a higher rating. The drinks are really good. Love the cheese curds.  The pizza is tasty but really greasy. I had the dish I don't remember the name but it was an Alfredo ziti dish.  It was good but almost too cheesy.  I always seem to leave this place with a belly ache. I'm guessing from all the grease. Will be coming back though because my husband likes it a lot. Service has always been good."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour! Th-Sun after 10pm free pizza and dirt cheap drinks. During the day the food is great as well. Could use a update looks a little divey. Still gave it 5 stars for value on happy hour."}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings in the valley hands down. Been going there for years!  Still make a monthly trip from the east valley just for their food. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Pizza and wings are the best around but just wished they delivered. Pepperoni is great and tastes fresh."}
{"text":"Moved from Phoenix ten years ago but still crave a cheese pizza and buffalo wings from this place."}
{"text":"This looks like a real dive from outside, but inside it's a decent pub/bar and restaurant.  They have a rather large bar section, and separate large restaurant section.  Service was very friendly and quick.  Good food.  My friend raved about the salad he had.  There's a wide selection of wing flavors, and all the ones I tried were great."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!!! Best wings I have ever had and amazing happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome. This is not some cheap pizza joint. An almost overwhelming menu full of many many choices. Not the cheapest but definitely the best."}
{"text":"Definitely the best place for pizza and wings I have ever had . The one in Glendale, Arizona is amazing, the wings are always crispy and fresh, the pizza is amazing, the pollukee is heavenly, there fries are so good especially when you dip it in the wing sauce. Not to mention,but their ranch is so good. Since I have a family of five , they have a good deal for a extra large pizza,  and forty wings for $35. My daughter and I are the foodies of my family, and we have a very expensive taste , we aren't picky we just know what foods are good and Pullano's  is is one of our favorites. Good job Pullano's , you passed the foodie test ."}
{"text":"Good place to hang out and have beers with the guys. Your nightly little pizza buffet is a nice addition. Italian food here is bad but the pizza stands out"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pepperoni pizza and 20 piece wings in spicy bbq and combustion spicy. The wings were not bad but the combustion hot wings were a bit vinegary, reminds me of lousiana hot sauce. the pizza was pretty big and the taste was ok. The service was not bad, overall the place was ok"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the traditional pizza and wings! That is always a family favorite of ours when we go to Pullano's.  The staff is always so friendly and attentive, the food is always delicious and flavorful and the beer is always ice cold!"}
{"text":"1.50 pints and free pizza on Saturdays. Half of appetizers and more. Friendly staff and the best part they have high stools to sit on."}
{"text":"I flat out love this place. The Happy Hour here is probably one of the best Happy Hours around this area.  The pizza is delicious. The bruschetta is amazing. Some friends and I went to Pullano's for lunch a few days ago and decided to try the Pepperoni chips (which I guess is a new appetizer they've got going on), anyway, if you're one of those people who will pick off the crispy pepperoni on your pizza and eat those first, this appetizer is definitely for you. They also have these really great buffalo mozzarella sticks. YUM!  Anywho, the staff is friendly and pretty fast."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!  I've not yet had anything that isn't spectacular.  The new artichoke heart scampi is out of this world!  My husband and I discovered this hidden treasure in our neighborhood 2 years ago in a search for hot wings. The wings are amazing too!  They have some of the best blue cheese dressing ever! The food comes out quickly and the servers are friendly and great.  However, they often forget to bring my wine and my water glass goes empty a lot which is an annoyance for me, hence the reason for only 4 stars. I highly recommend giving it a try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest but they always have great deals... Hard to resist! Usually a great crowd too!"}
{"text":"Just tried it the other day for the first time super cheap prices really great pizza  thin crust is amazing.. we will definitely be checking this place back out for some hot wings"}
{"text":"Excellent wings. We asked for them dry and extra crispy for a take out order hoping we wouldn't have soggy wings by the time we got home and they were perfect. Their pizza is also really great. We bill be back !!"}
{"text":"Horrible service...we waited 45 mins for some pizza ,  10 mins before anyone comes to Greet us, the waitress never asked about getting us refills , it's 3 of us ...she brings us the bill...we asked were our food, I thought you ate ...What, like me check..we finally get it ...pizza was good, waitstaff Just gave you guys a black eye...won't be returning"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place.  While I haven't been there before 10pm and I don't necessarily go there for dinner, it is a great place for cheap beer and free pizza on the weekends.  Yes I said that right, Friday and Saturday night's from 10p - 12a it's a free pizza buffet and $1.50 drafts (used to be $1, but I'm not complaining).  They bring out 4 pizzas at a time to the buffet area and they get cleaned out pretty quickly, so make sure to take more than 1 slice at a time if you have a hearty appetite.  They're also a little slow at bringing out new pizzas, but if you plan accordingly, you can definitely get stuffed.    I haven't tried any of the other foods, and after reading the other reviews I think I will stick with $1.50 drafts and free pizza.  But the price is right, the beer is cold, and the pizza is good.  Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"The pizza and wings are really tasting. The service was great, but the location and atmosphere left something to be desired.  I would hit up pullanos again, but only for take out."}
{"text":"So let me say the food is still worth the price at Pullano's.  Wings are the best around!  Service is pretty good however when they are busy it definitely suffers.  But no worries.   That said we went to Pullano's last week and when we got there we noticed sitting at another table was our neighbor.  So we asked if we could sit at the table next to them and they said sure.  Sat down everyone ordered simple order pizza, wing, salad and Drinks.  Pizza was wrong however not a big deal they were good about it as were we.  When dinner was over we noticed they only brought one bill for the entire table of 6.  Instead of giving us each our own bill or even asking if we wanted separate checks.  If they would have we would have wanted separate checks but again not a big deal just think it should be our choice.  Then I noticed that they added a separate line for a gratuity of 18%.  We asked about it and were told that because we were a party of 6 there was an automatic 18% added to the bill as a surcharge.  I asked you mean in place of a tip?  She stated no the tip is extra.  I reminded her that our friends were there first and we were even seated at a different table before we noticed they were there.  There should have been two separate checks as well as jo surcharge.  She then just simply asked if she could take our bill.  Two issues here.  1.  If in fact there is going to be a surcharge for a party it should be mentioned up front, not hidden at the back of the menu.  2.  If one party joins another party they should be informed before they move that a surcharge will be added if You sit with your friends.     I checked around and I don't see a lot of surcharges being added for 6 people.  Also remember this is a Mom and Pop pizza joint not Mastros City hall.  But trying to keep it positive the food was still good."}
{"text":"I met a friend at Pullanos on a Monday night, and they were broadcasting MNF. There is two sides to the restaurant, a bar type side with high tables and lots of big flat screens, and then theres a dining side with long tables to accomodate large parties. We sat ourselves and our server Amber wasnt terribly quick to approach us, but she was nice.   After she took our drink order, another server came and asked us to move because she supposedly had some big party that was going to arrive. Now, we were sitting at a table that could accommodate a party. However, there was a perfectly fine table right behind ours that she could have sat them at, and left us alone. i could see if the place was super packed, but it wasnt, and they never even used that table that was behind us! it was completely open the whole night.  That pissed me off a good bit, and this is why i gave the 3 star rating instead of a 4.   Anyhow, our server brought the drinks and took our order. Now...i have a love affair with wings, and im starting to venture into the spicy side of life. so after consulting with Amber, i decided upon the Super Hot (or as the reciept says, XXXHot). The only difference between the Hot, and Super Hot is that they dont put butter into the sauce for Super Hot. Sounds like a peice of cake, right?  HELL NO.  it literally took me 30 min to finish 10 wings with this sauce on it. With snot in my nose and tears in my eyes, at wing no. 4 the midsize 2 alarm blaze in my mouth could only be smoldered with lots of ice, and sips of water. After that, i had to eat them one at a time, then take a break. Everytime our waitress came back to check on me, i was one wing less. I think she knew i was struggling, but she didnt laugh at me once. I did not leave that table till i finished them all, and i actually enjoyed the challenge (apparently the Super Hot is no. 3 on the totem pole. She said they have one with the Ghost pepper in it. Ouch). A gentleman sitting next to us ordered a VERY delicious looking pizza, along with two big bowls of wings. said it only costed him 25 or 30 bucks.   So if you love wings, and like em hot, you need to give this place a shot. The food was great tasting (and looking) and i would love to come back and try something else. the menu is huge so you have lots to choose from."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Mom-and-Pop Italian, what's not to like?  as other reviews said there's a dining room and bar; it obvious he gets a little bit louder in the bar. Both sides are usually packed, friendly employees, I probably go there probably once a week.   I will tell you one thing and it's either good news or bad news: they've got a very heavy hand when it comes to the ricotta.  Got an order a baked ziti one night and for the first time I  uttered the words, \"too much cheese\", which I have never uttered before in my life. So, again good news or bad news.     Families, drunks and everything in between, they show the pay-per-view fights.   Also note:   * They have a loyalty club which can earn you free food, be sure and sign up, and,  * TUESDAY'S: 1/2 OFF -- 50% OFF -- all Italian dinners!  Go online, take a look at their menu, there is six or eight items on that Italian dinner menu and at half-off it's a great value!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times, and had never fell to disappoint me! The wings are just so great, the sauce!! not too spicy and not to hot, and the right amount of crispiness."}
{"text":"Oh no, not again....I had the BEST DAMN PIZZA.....again! Stacey and Sarah are so amazing and helpful!  We love them and that magnificent food!"}
{"text":"I was sent here by someone who was also from the East Coast, specifically for the pizza. I also got the wings. We went on a Saturday night, the place was so crowded that we had to wait for a table, Don't say I didn't warn you. The pizza was truly worth it, I went boring and got a cheese pizza. It was super good. I guess I would compare it to NYPD in style. Medium thin crust, not greasy, nice and crunchy and bubbly. We started with the hot wings which were also very good. The hot is hot. Now I am kind of sad as my friend who lives around the corner moved Eastward and this will not be a regular stop. But of you're over by Cowtown Skateboards, drop in, great beer specials and a super happy crowd eating super good pizza, Staff was upbeat and peppy as well, since they have no choice, as the place is jumping!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I could eat here every night it's so good! They offer a different special every day! Free nachos on Sunday's, 60 cent wings on Thursdays, and half off Italian dinners on Tuesdays are our favorite specials! Besides that, they have some every day specials that we always can rely on. $32 for an extra large pizza and 40 wings (which can easily feed 4-5 people). the wait staff is amazing and friendly and always remembers us and what we eat/drink. ALSO, EVERYONE NEEDS TO TRY THE CINNA-KNOTS!!Total game changer. Love this place. Will always be a loyal Pullanos customer :)"}
{"text":"We have been going to Pullano's for years and usually order the cod, pasta dishes or pizza. This time I decided to try the jerk chicken wings. They were good, but I would probably try one of the other options if I ordered wings again.  I promised Lil Deb I would give her a shout out for her service and this is it. She was as patient as she good be with me considering how busy she was. I couldn't make up my mind which style of wings to get, which beer to order or which dressing - ranch or blue cheese. Both of us have worked in a restaurant when younger and know how hard a job it is. Any job that deals directly with the public has its challenges, so here's to you Lil Deb.  The food was delectable and the service memorable."}
{"text":"Just moved here from SF and this place was the first place I went to for dinner.  I went with my bf because he wanted to try pizza out here and actually found this place on yelp.   We ordered the Pullano's special as well as some wings and we devoured everything.   I absolutely love this place and fell in love with it the very first time which is a rare case for me no matter what the food is or where it is.  The staff there was super nice and our waitress Jessica was especially nice.  She welcomed me to the neighborhood and made me feel at home away from home.  They also have a bar and occasionally give free pizza there as well.  Also they have different specials everyday of the week so go check it out and see what their special is today!"}
{"text":"Their  wings & pizza are sooooo good . Will be coming here again . They also have lunch specials ! The setting is casual . Not too pricey either ."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for quite some time with my boyfriend, his dad, and friends. This bar is our all time favorite to watch football, UFC, or to just come and chill. If you come be sure to get Erika or Laura. They have TVs everywhere, so wherever you sit you'll have a great seat. The prices are good, so drink away. If you come during the week they have awesome specials too! Be sure to stop by and check it out."}
{"text":"What a great little hole in the wall. The wings are delicious. I ate wayyyy to many. The pizza is fantastic as well. I couldn't get enough. I wouldn't have seen this place because it is out of the way in the strip mall and not well advertised but it was full of people when we attended."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Pullanos for years now! I used to drive from Scottsdale just to get their wings. They are still just as great I remember!  I usually get a sausage pizza and medium and honey bbq wings. Their wings are absolutely to die for! They are by far the best wings I've had.   Their pizza is amazing as well. The sausage is Italian style sausage and they put lots of cheese on their pizza. My son likes the spaghetti and meat sauce.   I've never had anything from Pullanos that I didn't like. The staff of friendly and it's a comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love Pullano's!  This place has fantastic pizza and wings!  They've been around since 1979 and are a great place to enjoy any type of sporting event.  Be sure to hit them up on Wednesday for their pizza special.  I always walk away from this place full and happy!"}
{"text":"It used to be I would go to this place for pizza and that place for wings never could I go to a place where I could get both. By that I mean just delicious and quality. The pizza the cheese so much of it it'll stretch to the exit crust is on point to me so good I almost forget about the quality wings and get too full. Now the wings when asked for crispy and that's what I got the sauce is good very good. it's vice versa with the wings if I start with the wings I forget about the pizza so I battle with a balance every time I eat here. In the end I always am satisfied."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Italian food!! Everything hand made and fresh! Have been going here as long as I can remember and that's 37 years and they are still the best in town! Amazing food!"}
{"text":"Omg these wings are the best around, and I will drive to get good wings. Thank god I only live 5 minutes away. Go on tuesdays for the wing special, get the rasp chipotle and jerk flavors and ask for Jessica. :)"}
{"text":"My family and I have been regular customers of Pullanos for as long as I can remember. We love their pizza and wings special. It is our go to spot when we have a craving for delicious pizza and wings. Well, my last visit to Pullanos was a great disappointment and may have been my last visit. I was charged for 4 ranch, when in actuality I only had 3. PLUS I ordered pizza and wings, which you would think a couple ranch would at least be included with the wings. Celery was also ordered which was a $0.75 charge (again, why would this not be included with hot wings?) This company is going to nickel and dime itself out of business. I hope the extra $3.00 they scored  from my ranch and celery was worth many future visits from my family and I."}
{"text":"Ive been here three times.. and I think I can finally make an honest review.    I don't care what pizza you've had, or what sandwich you've eaten, or what wing you've devoured.  You MUST try Pullano's.  For years my favorite NY style pizza has been NYPD Pizza (valley-wide).  Well NYPD... you've been dethroned!.   I just moved from Chandler to Glendale and happen to live about a block away from this haven.  As we all moved in to the new place, we ordered Pullano's to go.  We got three pizzas and 40 wings.  Let me tell ya.. if it weren't for the people around me, I could have eaten 24 wings by myself and the a few slices of pizza.  But damn.. i had to share.  I had one slice of the delicious meat lovers pizza and about 6 wings.  It reminded me of the first time I've ever eaten a good slice of pizza and wings.    We went last night for their $5 large cheese pizza night (Wed) and being new to this place, I had no idea why it was so packed (duh), til I saw the special.  We waited for about 10min and were seated.  Jessica was our server and took awesome care of us.  I love it when the servers become your friends and make sure you have the greatest time. Jessica was awesome.  Also being Christmas time, someone was passing around cheese balls. I want to say it was the owner? (because he looks like the owner).  Yum!  We had a great experience, and Im happy to say I found a new favorite pizza place.  Thank you Pullano's!!"}
{"text":"Simply put, my favorite place for pizza, pasta, atmosphere and service in the greater Phoenix area.  My family and I are in 3-4 days a week because we love the food and the staff is the best around.  the Sunday breakfast is awesome...lots of great choice and very inexpensive.  Same with 1/2 off pasta Tuesday.  The pasta is home made and the sauces are delicious!  It's a must if you are in the area!  ~ Rod Cooper"}
{"text":"Omggg Pullano's, where do I even start? First of all, this place is crazy close to us, which is a huge bonus :) Ever since \"Daddy-O's\" (gag me) took over Casey Jones (such a sad day), we've been looking for a new cheap bar that has a good atmosphere.  Enter: Pullano's! My boyfriend's brother told us about it and we finally went a couple of weeks ago... score!! We've been back twice since and, if we didn't keep ordering practically the entire menu and EATING IT ALL, we would go back more often...  The pizza? Awesome! Customize, order straight off the menu, whatever. Certain days they offer crazy specials on pizza (one special offers you a large pizza for free, if I recall correctly), so that's always worth looking into.  Great prices on pitchers of beer-- end of story. Get crunk (or watch your friends get crunk-- DDs are our friends!) on pitchers of beer from $9 (domestic) to $13.25 (seemingly everything else).  The servers are all young and very friendly, which is totally sweet. We've never had a mean or grumpy server-- huge plus. You may even get lucky and have one of the owners serve you, which is so cute, in my opinion.  Thursdays are the days to get wings (although I don't know if this changes...?? Call or check online). When we went (on a Thursday), wings were $.40 and, according to my boyfriend, really good.  I'm personally a fan of the pizza (duh) and the happy hour prices for appetizers-- um, $4 for a GIANT plate of bruschetta? Yeah, sign me up!  The only \"downsides\", if you can call it that, is that the place is ALWAYS busy. We've gone on a Thursday night, a Saturday around 3 p.m, and a Friday around 8... not \"dead\" times but not exactly hopping... but Pullano's was BUSY. Be prepared to wait 5 min. more and have to maneuver around large parties (that inexplicably like to push their chairs into the aisle...)  The other thing is the menu--- holy crap. Be prepared to sit there for a solid 10 min. trying to understand it all if its your first time there. The menu is HUGE and the print is really tiny. I mean, I'm practically blind, so take that with a grain of salt, but still. It's tiny print. Just be warned.  That said-- don't go. This is my bar, y'all ;)"}
{"text":"Love their food a ton but they don't accept American Express. I had holiday gift cards and those were turned away."}
{"text":"Great local dive bar, good food and drink specials. Don't feel like heading downtown, to scottsdale or somewhere far and just need to relax? This place is perfect."}
{"text":"First time here. Great service. Large menu. Food came out fast and was delicious! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It took several days and many phone calls to reach the owner to make this right.  He did eventually refund the money, but it was still more hassle than it was worth.  My rating stands as it is, I will still choose another place for pizza on girls night in."}
{"text":"Today was my first time here,  it's quite a drive from my central phx home,  but it's worth it.  The pizza and wings are delicious, the hot and honey hot wings are delicious and crispy.  This will be our new to go place.  I can't wait to try the happy hour at the bar.  :) I'll be definitely going back."}
{"text":"Garlic Cheesy Bread and wings were on point! service was quick and friendly, you can tell why they have a lot of regulars. Wait staff and bartenders were quick on their feet and worked as a team, something I always appreciate in a restaurant.   Pizza looked good, but I gotta have to get wings when I go!"}
{"text":"They have a really awesome lunch special which is a HUGE slice of pizza and 6 wings. Their pizza is eh and so is their wings but the main reason i go to this place as much as i do is because of their BOMB ASS chile limon wing sauce! ITS DELISH!   I've also tried their lasagna which is ok, but they have this plate with 5 giant  cheese ravioli's and thats really great. Its salty but delicious!   for being close to home and a mom and pop, this place isnt not bad. I'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Hey, wait a second. Since when are pizza parlors this cool? Not only are they a sit down restaurant and delivery spot during the day, they turn into a dive bar at night. Can't say I've seen much of that! And the beers are as cheap as they get. $2 pints of Killian's Red? So awesome that my liver just flinched.  The pizza is just alright. Sweet sauces can be awesome, but only if you have the right crust and cheese to balance that out. On top of that, I know a meaty pizza can get greasy, but Pullano's is excessively so. In hindsight, the $13 for the 16\" really wasn't worth it, but maybe if you wait for some of the specials they have on Wednesday, you can sample a cheaper one for yourself. The menu is VERY expansive, too, which tells me you're pretty much gonna get more of the same as far as quality.  3 as a pizza place, but a solid 5 as a dive."}
{"text":"I really like this place a lot. There seems to be a lot of families that go here, larger groups. The waitresses are nice and it's clean inside. I like the HD flat screen tv's. They always seem to have sports on which is what you want at a sports bar. ;) I have not tasted the pizza but i have tried their krab salad, cheese fries, meatball sub, and Italian sub. All of them were fantastic. My boyfriend always gets the philly cheese steak with fries. He says it's decent but still not as good as Philly's Best in Cali. The interior is rather simple and not at all fancy but has a homey appeal to it. Prices are good and you get large portions here. Definitely recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for 25 years, my girls are great (service) and the pizza & wings are the best!!"}
{"text":"Pullano's what happened?  Your wings were off the charts, now an order of extra crispy buffalo wings are soggy and just not as good (in the last year). The quality and taste justified the price ($$) for a pizza and wing joint, however, not so much anymore.   When the good wings come back, so will we."}
{"text":"Fun place to eat.  The staff are so willing to meet your needs, including the effort of making a pizza (Taco Pizza) that is no longer on the menu.  An excellent pizza, I might add.  One of the best Taco Pizzas I have had the opportunity to try.  Some of the hot wings my hot wing loving family have had.  Will be going back very soon!!"}
{"text":"20 year customer hear........ I'm happy to put 4 stars up on the board. I brought in a sales rep for lunch today he wanted Italian I told him There's only one place to Go PULLANOS! We ate, we talked, we drank, we are some more and were more than happy with the service!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't need Yelp's blessings or review because it's been here for a 1,000 years and thanks to the food & drink, will be here for a 1,000 more.  Huge menu with tons of stuff but pizza & wings are the star. Prices are the co-star. We weren't there for happy hour but methinks if you want to get happy (beer) & full (pizza) for not a lot of money, this is the place to do it.  They even have an appetizer that made me like artichokes. (And I HATE artichokes) I think the secret ingredient is magic. Also, perhaps copious amounts of butter.  Family-run operation that definitely appears to be a labor of love --- I put this on my Mt. Rushmore of Italian-style eateries in town (along with Uncle Sam's and Santisi Brothers) -- but you can't beat the bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Ok  been here 3-4 times and finally taking the time to write a short review.  This is a great spot for wings, pizza, salad and subs!!  So far  my top in the Phoenix area  everything I have had.... I have loved.  Im sold it is not to close to my house but Iam convinced I need to drive to get great pizza, lots of flavor and it heats up fantastic the next day (the cheap pizza sometimes is good but doesnt taste like anything the next day!)   the winds are great  and if you like heat  they got it.   the italian sub is great toasted cant wait to go back again for lunch  $7.99 1/2 a sub and salad  great dressing salads are fantastic.  Im sure their pastas are just as good will be there soon to try them out......Customer Service is top notch   servers and very attentive to your needs and freely let you know if a special is a better deal for you.  great place you will love it!!"}
{"text":"Food was very good I live down the street but never came in but today I had to go to the laundry mat a few doors down so I decided to go in and check it out. Glad I did I ordered a meatball sandwich and fries it was delicious it was big enough that I took 1/2 home they also sell cheese curds something I can't find at to many places in Az....Bought some to take home..YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious....BEST buffalo chicken pizza that I've ever tasted!!! Staff was super friendly and very patient with children.  If they had delivery, my waistline would be in serious danger....well worth the drive, plus delicious desserts after awesome food!"}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings in the area. I will go out of my way to order from here! Service is just okay dont expect anything fast, but everyone is in such a rush I guess it tough to be friendly and fast"}
{"text":"Great wings with lots of tasty sauce offerings.  \"Medium\" is always a good choice for bone-in wings.  Decent weeknight deals and happy hour specials so you don't break the bank.  The Italian pasta dinners taste hand-crafted by an Italian grandmother...with abundant portions and fresh side salads.  Ricotta cheese is on point. Bar area service is lacking at times, and separate dining rooms gets pretty crowded.  Overall, a good place to go if you want  to watch sports, drink a few,  fill up your belly, relax, chat, and enjoy."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  The pizza is on point.  Came on Wed and got the special.  A large cheese pizza.  We added two toppings.  It was awesome.  I will be back.  Very cool vibe here!  Everyone was really nice.  And the service was quick!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Yea. Wings are back to original flavor under the name spontaneous combustion. I have been coming to Pullanos since they opened. In 2011 the wings were not as good. Now, Delicious wings and oh so good pizza. Best pizza of my lifetime on 8/8/2016. Extra well done, thin crust, light sauce, cheese pizza. I'm still dreaming about that pizza today!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant super clean, location close to ASU West.  Service; Deb on restaurant side is amazing, super friendly and outgoing.  Food; always fresh and yummy.   Check for daily Specials"}
{"text":"I have been going here for about 3 years now. I love it. Great food, great happy hour prices. I wish they had a half-pound option for boneless wings because I never finish the full pound. That's my only complaint though. This is my spot for football too, go cardinals!"}
{"text":"After having such an awesome time at Super Bowl and enjoying all the amazing food I had to come back here!!! We got this perfectly cooked thin crust pizza with basil So delicious, this will be one of our regular spots from now on! Thanks Pullano's for having a Super Bowl party you got a regular customer here!!!! My husband loved the wings said they were cooked to perfection!  We will be back soon"}
{"text":"Our first time here, my nephew and I. We walked in the bar side. Lolz. I was so lost. Haha   Great selection on the menu. The garlic grunch banana bell pepper bread was awesome. :))))  Slow service. I had three people who helped me....rhe check took foreverrrr   Yeah. ..idk if I'll be back. :("}
{"text":"Just left yet another family birthday gathering at Pulano's... everything was perfect... starting with the crab salad and fabulous lemon dressing... always a favorite... the 2 sets of wings were perfect, as were the 2 pizzas... topped off with bday dessert treat!!"}
{"text":"Perfect neighborhood, locally owned spot. If you want great pizza (and i know pizza,) delicious wings, and friendly bartenders, you need to get in your car and go to Pullano's! Another get thing on the menu is the artichoke scampi, gotta get it. :)  This not only is a great place for some food that will really stick to your guts, but just a great place to go with friends, have some drinks and get on the juxbox!"}
{"text":"Great serviced prices. Employees are friendly and nice. Bathroom is always clean so that's great.  Food tastes good too. Very chill place. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I have eaten there many times and the food is always really good but I had a bad experience last night. Called in two large thin crust pepperoni pizzas \"pretty simple\" was craving it all week. I got there early so sat there waiting watching customers come in to pick up orders, 3 out of the 4 were wrong and the customers took it anyway because they didn't want to wait to get it right. Mine came out and it wasn't thin crust but regular crust, they confirmed my call-in ticket and offered to make new ones. Like the others I took it because I didn't want to wait, I was not very satisfied. next time if there's a next time ill ask for my money back and go to Barrows."}
{"text":"My family and I are regulars here at Pullano's, and we love it. The mozzarella sticks are delicious, and the pizza is pretty standard and greasy but still good. This is the perfect place to watch football or any other sporting event, with a few big-screen TV's around the dining room area. The decor is reminiscent of an old-school pizza parlor with the red-checkered table cloths. Overall good food, reasonable prices, and a nice family environment. My only complaint? The service.  SO SLOW.They never refill our   drinks, and half the time three different people are serving you. Good luck knowing who your server is! If the service was more consistent, I would rate this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years. First, it started in the 1990s with pizza and wings takeout.  Their wings are the best.  I usually get medium.   Wed and Thurs nights are currently my favorite.  Wed is $6 large cheese pizza night, and Thurs is wing night.  The service, at least when I have gone, has always been polite and attentive.  Food is delivered in a reasonable time.  I mainly eat int he restaurant, but have been in the bar.  I also have tried their pasta, and their spaghetti is awesome, as well as their lasagne. Their subs are great too, except the Phili cheese steak  is not quite a Phili...more just a cheese steak with yellow cheese and no mushrooms or peppers, but is still pretty good. The bar has a burger and beer special for $5, and the burger is great."}
{"text":"I think this has to be the best happy hour ever.  $1 bottles and free pizza?  It doesn't get much better than that.  There are also tons of TVs for sports.  When I came there was a Diamondbacks playoff game here and the place was packed.  Service was hit or miss but for the value you are getting who cares."}
{"text":"Ohhhhh ya! This pizza place is legit. The husband has eaten here several times since it's near his work, and he finally brought me a few weeks ago. When you approach, you don't know what to expect.... It looks like a semi divey sports bar from the outside. Inside, you get the feel of a real east coast pizzeria.... You know, red checked plastic tablecloths.... Nothing fancy. We got the pizza and wings combo (which is offered everyday and saves a couple bucks from their separate prices). We got the hot wings, though they have like 20 flavors of sauce. The hot wings were some of the best in town. The chicken was perfectly fried, juicy on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside and the sauce was your typical hot wing sauce. This would be a must order. The pizza was also awesome.... Definitely not a fancy pizza.... It reminded me of Barro's a bit, because it had a puffier crust than your typical new york pizza, but it tasted better than Barro's. We had pepperoni and ricotta on the pizza, and it was sinfully tasty. This is the place to go in the west valley when you're feeling like a solid 'classic' pizza. Only downside is the price is a little high, but not terrible. Put this place on your to try list!"}
{"text":"This pizza's a lot like Barros - greasy, salty and really fills you up. And to be honest, it's not my favorite. But the prices here make it totally worthwhile. I ordered takeout for a large with 1 one topping. Well they had a special for a cheese pizza for 5 bucks on Wednesdays. Total came out to 7 dollars and change for that extra topping (after tax) and I could barely get thru half!  I didn't have time to look at the bar side but the drink prices for happy hour are excellent. 99 cent domestic drafts on weekdays from 3 to 6pm. Also tons of food and drink specials on their website. I'd check this place out because it's so damn cheap, it's hard to knock it."}
{"text":"Pullanos is the only pizza we get when we are craving pizza. Light sauce, whatever toppings I'm feeling, and well done crust is always my order. Their specials and pizza give it four stars, I've had hit and misses with their wings, sometimes they are amazing white meat pieces but I sometimes get a funky over breaded piece or something like cartilage. So can't miss pizza and some friendly service and good appetizers is how I see them."}
{"text":"this place has great pizza. good sandwiches, and good wings. as much as i enjoy the pizza, i gave 4 stars instead of 5, because of one time were the service was not so good. one time. other than that service is pretty solid. beer is always ice cold too."}
{"text":"Pullano's is our go to for the absolutely best pizza! The crust, sauce, flavor and selection of toppings is what keeps us coming back! The salad and bread are super delicious.  The staff is friendly and they recognize us when we arrive each week which makes a difference; it shows they appreciate and value their customers. We eat their delicious food weekly!! Can't wait to return to order our next pizza. If you haven't tried Pullano's it is a must; you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers, we love this place.  My husband loves the pizza, I am addicted to their wings....mmm....their wings!"}
{"text":"A five star review is very rare, this place deserves five stars though. There pizza and wings are amazing and I would recommend this place, and have recommended it to most of my friends. Good date place also!"}
{"text":"Ive been coming to this place since I was a kid, and I swear it gets better each visit. We always get the kyles, and wings and they are gone within a matter of moments. The pizza is always hot and fresh and made with the best ingredients.the staff has always been amazing and sweet, and so helpful! Plus my husband and I love watching the game and grabbing a beer. we will always be a customer here!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wings are great! Gf and I got the medium and garlic parm to split. Both were amazing. Got ranch for the side and it was really good too. Not too thick and not watered down. Drinks were huge and their ice tea is really good. I got lemon and it even looked good. A big slice and it was juicy. (I'm picky) We also got the bacon jalapeño popper and they were super good. Been driving by this place for 5 years and never stopped in to eat...stupid. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"1st time at pullano's pizza and was really good , not great but really good. We are from Vegas and we visited some friends , wings to die for but pizza can be little bit more crispy .. but we will come back and trying again..."}
{"text":"Love this place... never had anything we didn't like ! The owners Mike and Bonnie are great :)  Nightly specials (my favorite  is Thursday  wing night ) ."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza and wings it's one of the best in the valley. Every time I come by here this place is packed.  Great service. The decor is old school pizza style which is rare nowadays but it's definitely worth it to come by and taste this goodness"}
{"text":"You can't get any better than the Raspberry Chipotle on 75 cent wing night.  Great beer, great wings, and  great atmosphere equal GREAT NIGHT!  Thank you Mike for your great vibes in Glendale, AZ!"}
{"text":"Good old-fashioned American pizza/tavern here, with $2 pints of domestic beers during happy hour when I was there and appetizer specials as well.  I didn't care so much for the \"spicy\" pasta sauce since it seemed to be marinara with buffalo wing sauce mixed into it.  Pizza was fresh with a pillowy soft crust and good cheese.  Service was prompt, though a bit traditional - I'm glad that there's another pint of beer in front of me without having to order it, but some of us just don't drink the same beer over and over."}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings in town!  They have great specials and service is friendly and pretty fast."}
{"text":"Classic Italian food done right. From their pasta dishes, pizza and subs, you can't go wrong here. I haven't had a meal here that wasn't amazing. Best red sauce! They have great daily food specials, too. Also, the bar area has really good drink specials almost daily. As in $1 bottled beers and free pizza at certain times (if you've ordered a drink, of course). Service is super, the employees here are always friendly and attentive. I really like this place :)"}
{"text":"This message is to Mike.  Just wanted to say, I brought my grandma here the other night, and she got mad at me for not showing her this place years ago. She has a real Italian food tooth, and she fell in love with food, and the place. I like how it doesn't look a day out of the late 80's. Just like another, old and memorable submarine sandwhich shop on 35th Ave and Peoria. All these people saying your food is terrible make me laugh. 36 years is hard to come by. Thanks for serving that real food up!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for pizza and wings. Best pizza I've found.  Has a little bit of a sweet taste to their sauce. Wings are awesome. Always great service. We highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place so much, I went on Wednesday & I'm going back for lunch today.best wings in the city hands down!!!!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant.  We've enjoyed their pasta and their pizzas and have not been disappointed. Everything is fairly priced.   Love their happy hour too!  The staff has always been very friendly. You won't be disappointed if you try this place."}
{"text":"A high three. I hesitated to come here because I do not like eating at a bar but realized I had nothing to fear. Do not let that stop you. They are actually a cute neighborhood restaurant. The bar is separated from the dining area, yeah!  Pros- the NY Pretzel app is quite good. I was very surprised. It even has that slightly burnt NY, city vendor cart taste. I also really liked their Baja dip that comes with the pretzel.   The pizza is not great but not bad either. Kind of AZ average but on the high end. On the positive though their one slice special is huge. Literally two or three meals.   Tiramus is good but again not great. I have had better.  Cons- the service was really not that great. In fact, it was kind of strange. The server was super nice and all and brought the food relatively fast but she never checked on me once. The initial greet also took too long. She never refilled my drinks then just brought me a \"to go\" refill soda and the check.   Now, I am grateful for the \"to go\" drink. However, I just found that odd since I did not ask for one nor was I finished eating. I also wanted dessert. Maybe she was just having an off day. I will not hold it against them. All in all it is a very nice neighborhood Italian restaurant. I will go back since their lunch specials look great. However, Rays is not far from me and they really are hard to beat."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure how to rate Pullano's. I'm a little torn. My experience was better than 3 stars but not quite as good as 4.  First, the staff were all very patient and friendly. We were a large party and not sure of what we wanted. We ended up with, a small order of breadsticks, 40 wings (half medium, half BBQ), 1 XL Pepperoni, 1 XL Pepperoni with green peppers.   Breadsticks were brought out soon after our drinks. 2 pitchers of beer, a few sodas. Breadsticks were hot, soft and dripping with butter. Yum! Served with a small cup of marinara that no one touched.  Wings came shortly after. Wings were above average size cooked to mosts liking. (I prefer a super crispy wing, most in our party did not) Sauces on the wings were outstanding. The medium was a really good balance of spice and vinegar tang. BBQ was smoky and sweet. The wings came the old fashioned way with celery and carrots, a nice touch. We had a split of ranch and blue cheese. Ranch was typical, but the blue cheese was strange to me. Don't get me wrong there was nothing wrong with it but t didn't taste like blue cheese. It had a peppery taste and was a creamy color.  Pizza arrived about 5-10 minutes after. The pizza is good but...I hate to say this but it had to much cheese. Yes, too much cheese. I love cheese but the crust on the pizza could not stand up to the weight of all of that cheese. The pizza crust is crispy on the outside, soft in the inside with a slight taste of yeast. The middle of the pizza was a soggy mess after sitting only a few minutes with the cheese barely melted in the middle. I would love that crust with just a smear of sauce and a sprinkling of cheese. Would be heaven on a pizza pan.  Restaurant could use a little scrubbing, but I have to say I enjoyed my first experience at Pullano's and will definitely make another trip.   They also have a small bar attached and there were several TV's in the dining room with football games on. A good place for families."}
{"text":"MMMMMMM.....chicken wings. These are the best wings in town. Pizza is good too. We go for the 30 cent wing ding night on Monday. Split 30 or 40 wings a couple sodas and leave full for less than $15. The happy hour specials in the bar are pretty kick ass too. Can't beat $1 drafts and free pizza. We have turned all of our friends on to Pullano's (including some of the reviewers here)."}
{"text":"Great pizza , awesome wings and not to mention happy hour is UNBEATABLE! I've been going here for a year and Deborah our waitress is AMAZING !"}
