{"text":"Brought a group of ten for breakfast. We had called ahead to tell them we were ten and they did not know anything about that. They cramped us in four tables and we had to ask for a fifth to fit. They would not change ice cream to fruit on waffle even if I paid a little more. Potatoes and bacon were burnt. Will never go there again. Dagenais one in Laval is the best."}
{"text":"Hawaiian Benedictines are to die for. The morning combo with brioche is pretty amazing too. Definitely vastly superior to similar chains, but with the same prices. You can tell they ensure all their fruit is perfectly ripe, tasty and sweet."}
{"text":"Puisque c'est situé près de mon travail, j'y vais à chaque semaine. Je ne prends jamais les déjeuners mais plutôt le menu du midi. 
Il y a toujours beaucoup de monde et énormément de bruit. La soupe est toujours excellente et semble être maison, le reste du repas n'est pas toujours égal mais c'est un bon rapport-qualité qu'il est bon de souligner."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast place. I went there every morning during my weeklong trip to Montreal. Potions are huge. Most days I hardly needed any lunch. My absolute favourite was the avocado benedict. Fruit salad is very good, too."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of breakfast places. They are mostly all the same. What surprised me the most about this one was the fruit. It was fresh, tasty and diverse. I very much enjoyed my meal here."}
{"text":"I love allo mon coco but this is by far the worst allo mon coco that I've ever been to and I've dined at 4 other locations. Not only are the portions smaller than the other but the taste was not up to par either.  Not to mention the ac wasn't working inside and today was incredibly hot and humid. They shouldn't even have been able to open, it was so hot inside. Anyways, never going there again and I would not recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Long line of waiting on Sunday. The brunch menu has a large selection. Big portion. It's Texas size portion in Montreal. My wife and I shared an omelette and it was over cooked and bland."}
{"text":"Good food with very friendly, and courteous service. If you don't speak French fluently, don't try, even if you think you're doing the server a favour. I ordered what I believed was 2 eggs, bacon and a crepe. What I got was 2 pancakes French toast and a fruit bowl. After bringing my \"wrong order\" to the waitress, she politely pointed out my mistake, I acknowledged and apologized, and she still brought me an egg and two slices of bacon free of charge. Lesson here: it's a tourist town and the service staff is well trained to take your order in English, understanding it much better than you probably understand French. 

My buddy ordered a fruit plate (in English) and she asked him again if he wanted that fruit plate to make sure that she heard him say \"fruit plate\". It wasn't any kind of language barrier. This is because the fruit plate stands as tall as a small child with almost every fruit you find at a grocery store. It looked like a fruit top hat. Eating it was an experience he described as an adventure. 

Overall, the food was very good atmosphere was nice and the service was quick. I never got a refill on my coffee, but you can't win em all. I say take a chance on this place."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. Also been to other locations which were better. 
This location is small and crammed. Service is somewhere between unfriendly and rude. Price is steeper than other breakfast places. Is it because they give you a huge portion of potatoes? Perhaps. I asked to swap tomatoes for the potatoes because I'm vegetarian and don't eat their chicken broth based potatoes but they were going to charge me for the tomatoes as an \"extra ingredient\". Are you kidding me?
Too cocky and high on themselves. Putting customers last only takes you so far. 
Oh and, even if I had thought of ever returning again, I will not, thanks to the waiter my boyfriend saw, exit the toilet stall and head straight out the door, completely bypassing the sink. Gross."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is so popular! Been hearing about this place from my co-workers! Food is ok and the price a bit high so nothing very special that would want to make me come back!"}
{"text":"One of the breakfast place I recommend to go. Good variety and great staff. Great environment and staff alway smile and know their menu. I order an Egg Benedict and my girlfriend order an Americain Steak Breakfast and it was really delicious. I went there 4 time and will go there again."}
{"text":"Regular breakfast food. Slightly more expensive than ordinary. Service is quite good with nice personnel. Decor is nice. The down side is their coffee is pretty bad, weak with a bitter taste"}
{"text":"Stopped in here to eat shortly after arriving in Montreal. We were exhausted from travel and hungry, and Allo Mon Coco was the first place we saw near our AirBNB. It was late in the afternoon and the restaurant was otherwise empty, so it took the hostess several minutes to notice us. 

The breakfast/brunch food was good, but not exceptional. The crepe was the best part of my meal, and please note that ordering cheese on your potatoes will get you A LOT of cheese! The eggs were cooked just right. The portion sizes should not be underestimated! Out leftovers were dinner that night."}
{"text":"This was the worst meal I have had in Montreal. Service was abysmal & food was bland, would not recommend.

When we arrived the restaurant was about half full with lots of staff. We asked for a table for 2, were seated at a 4 seat table with 3 menus. We ordered the Avocado Benedict & Bacon Benedict - both were flavourless. The potatoes were mushy & lukewarm except for a hot spot in the middle - the shredded cheese didn't even begin to melt on the potatoes, nor did the sliced cheese used on the Benedicts. We had to ask another waitress for condiments because nobody asked us how the food was or if we needed anything. I ended up eating only the bowl of fruit that came with my breakfast which was undeniably the best part.

Would not return or recommend. The only reason this restaurant got 2 stars & not 1 was because of how clean the dining area was."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, but lately the service has become unbearable. The staff is so unpleasant at this Allo mon Coco.

Service aside, the food is pretty good. I had a great crabcake eggs benedict the last time and the potatoes are to to die for. 

This place is a pretty typical breakfast restaurant, orher than their amazing potatoes nothing really separates them from any other breakfast joint.

Would i go back? Yeah probably...but more so because it's close to home"}
{"text":"This formerly amazing restaurant has crashed and burned. Avoid at all costs! They were understaffed so our wait time for the food was over 45 minutes. All the food came cold. The server barely apologized and blamed the kitchen staff. As she explained the delay she was spilling coffee all over the table. She left the puddle of coffee there for 15 minutes while we waited for the remainder of our food. We asked for condiments for the toast and ketchup. After 5 minutes she threw mayonnaise and Tabasco sauce on the table but nothing else! The hostess came by and simply said \"this is why I'm quitting\". Horrible!"}
{"text":"Montreal, I don't know what's in the water here but shit, you guys do breakfast and you do it well. Three days and three aces. But if you asked me my favourite, that would be like asking me to choose between food and sex, my first and second born, a pizza.. or a panzerotti, you just can't choose, because they're all amazing.

Allô Mon Coco is another location addition to Montreal's vast industry of gourmet restaurant chains (seriously, I think if you were to investigate Montreal's GDP, breakfast/brunch spots might account for 20-30%).

Enough fluff, onto the good stuff. Great location in a great part of the Plateau neighbourhood, with a massive patio that had to be about 100ft x 100ft, in addition to the massive modern interior space. We requested to sit on the patio as it was a beautiful morning and luckily we got a seat right away.

After reviewing their extensive menu I went with their special eggs benedict. The special came with three kinds of breakfast meat (Canadian bacon, sausage and regular bacon) smothered in thick cheesy delicious hollandaise sauce! Paired with sides of cooked potatoes (which I asked to be topped with cheese) and a massive bowl of fruit. 

One word describes this mean and five syllables, Un-be-liev-a-ble. That's all you need to know.

Thank you Montreal and Allô Mon Coco for amazing breakfast and an amazing weekend as always

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Great first experience! When the waitress asked if we wanted cheese on our potatoes, we were sold (big cheese fans here). The portions are generous, the staff is polite and the food is delicious! We will be returning often, as I believe we have found the best breakfast joint in Blainville."}
{"text":"Yay for breakfast joints for early starts to the day. Very friendly staff and fun selection of breakfast surprises. I got the crab cake eggs Benedict - portion wise- they are very generous! Fresh fruits and grapefruit juice were great. Fun family spot in dix30"}
{"text":"I took my 95 year old mother to Allo mon coco as a treat, and it was!
This place is amazing! The food is such good quality and the variety seems endless.  ( it'll take you an hour to read through the bilingual menu  )
So; I can truly recommend this restaurant and wish they stayed open all day!"}
{"text":"If you're hungry and looking for good breakfast food, go here. Portions are huge!! Food is yummy. Service is helpful and nice. Only issue, some of my food was a tad cold. Other than that, it was great! Oh yea, the latte that comes in a bowl was amazing.... if only every restaurant or coffee shop did that :("}
{"text":"Very solid breakfast option in the Cote-Vertu Mall.

Very spacious, bright with lots of tv's and newspapers to start your day informed.

The service is very quick and efficient, we were a large group of 12-14 and there were no mistakes in terms of orders and our coffees were filled a few times. 

I had the steak and eggs, (something hard to find in breakfast places in Montreal), the steak was very good, the potatoes were great.

Tow minor gripes: the eggs seemed really small and there was not enough fruit as garnish, just 2-3 bland tomato slices.

Overall, everybody was pretty happy with this new addition, the prices are in line with breakfast options in the city (Their prices are listed on the website, nice touch others should copy)."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Neither of our eggs were cooked the way we asked. Food wasn't very hot. Server took my tea to warm up, never came back with it.  Would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Note: I was on the opening of the restaurant. So many things can be change quickly to adapt the new crowd. 

With that said, it was perfect. A bit too perfect! There was clearly double staff and everybody was on it's A-game.

The portions where HUGE! I have no clue how long they are going to keep them this way, but the banana pancake, my favourite thing in the world for breakfast at Allo mon coco! Was on steroids! The best! I hope they keep up this way!

I will probably come back sooner then later and I will do an other review when the dust will settle."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place. The plates are huge, the quality is high.

At first I hated the potatoes because they are more \"smashed\" potatoes then breakfast potatoes. But after a few tries I'm now in love with them.

If you feel down for a full fry-up choose the Logger/Bûcheron. Looking for something light with tons of fruits? Choose the Good Morning. My favorite of the moment: The special Allo mon Coco: A good fry-up with a moist and fluffy banana pancake to get a sweet treat to balance all the salt of the bacon/ham/sausage.

My only concern: The parking is kind of a madhouse."}
{"text":"Expensive, and taste of food was below average for plateau area. Had to pay a few extra bucks for real maple syrup.

Had the pancake, french toast and waffle combo with english cream. Nothing stood out. Also, the french toast was supposed to have raisins in it. I asked about this after my food arrived and only then was I informed that they were out of raisin bread. 

I don't plan to return."}
{"text":"In my opinion the food was horrible. I ordered the blueberry pancakes with a side order of sausage and a fruit cocktail. The blueberry pancakes had no flavor and were too thick so they weren't even cooked well in the middle. I love pancakes and I've never been to a restaurant were I hated them but there is a first time for everything. As far as the sausages they never arrived, I waited for them and reminded the waitress still they never came and I was still charged for them on the bill. The fruit cocktail was alright but the one at Chez Cora is much more delicious. Overall I had a horrible experience I could have eaten much better at Chez Cora, I will never return ....."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant overall. Interior decor is very nice, spacious and clean. Very friendly staff and attentive. Large menu with many great choices to choose from which makes it hard to actually pick something! But rather that than a junk menu. Highly recommended and would return myself when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"good portion...nothing special though...untrained staff with no guidance and no management or smiles to be seen. The portion was good on the other plates that actually made their way to the table...somehow it was my problem that the staff doesn't verify to make sure all the plates of the group show up at the right table. I hope no one else has the same experience here. I will not be coming back here... To many restaurants to waste time at places that don't know what they are doing...explains the reason there was no lineup ...should have waited at l'Avenue down the street."}
{"text":"The crepes were amazing, the cream they use is perfect. Omelette was good as well, cute spot with friendly staff. Would definitely go again"}
{"text":"Si vous voulez manger rapidement vous êtes au bonne endroit, nous sommes pas sûr le meilleur brunch de Montréal mais vous pouvez y aller sans crainte vous mangerez à votre faim :) 
Le service est très bien fait et très professionnel, la personne concernée connaissait parfaitement ça carte . 
Si vous êtes pressé aller y c'est l'endroit parfait !!"}
{"text":"I always order choco coco and it never deceives me! Spacious place, nice decor, great for a brunch day. Always packed on sundays. Service is good, waiters are courteous."}
{"text":"Catastrophique! Une des pires expériences de brunch de notre vie, tout commence bien nous passons notre commande, la serveuse prend le temps de m'expliquer une subtilité sur le choix de patates... Ensuite on nous ramène nos plats, immédiatement je remarque un poil de cheveux sur mes patates! La serveuse récupère mon plat immédiatement pour changer les patates... ensuite ils ont oublier les cretons dans nos assiettes nous avons dû les réclamer par nous mêmes, jusque la a peine un petit désolé de la part de la serveuse, ensuite le pain que j'ai commander n'était pas le bon, mais j'étais tellement fatiguer d'avoir a courir après les erreurs du resto que j'ai simplement laisser tomber...
Pour finir ma crêpe était froide, c'était pas du sirop d'érable... et le sol était dangereusement glissant 

Quand on demande la facture tellement le resto avait honte ne nous demande pas si c'était à notre gout, et aucun geste pour s'excuser 

Je n'y retournerais jamais"}
{"text":"Worst Benedict egg ever ! Center over cooked and gravy with no personality. The bacon was half ham ! Worst timing in history, the Benedict egg came first and the plate with two eggs and bacon came 10 minutes later !?"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. The DiCapra Eggs Benedict were very good (per my wife) and I had their signature crepe omelet which I couldn't finish and had to take to go. 

The fresh squeezed orange juice was very good. 

Give it a try!"}
{"text":"If i want my husband to be my bestie, I need to make sure his stomach is always full... And if it is a Saturday and we are going to the mall then I definitely need to be on his good side :P
On Saturday morning, I got my husband out of bed earlier than usual and offered to bring him to allo mon coco... My plan really being to get him to Quartier dix30 for the shops! We parked the car in the heated underground parking which makes it even more convenient as it was winter and snow. Despite the lineup at the door to Allo Mon Coco, it was very well managed and people in line respected the order of priority! The breakfast menu is similar to most of the other brunch places but this is one of our favourite spots because of the good service, comfy banquette and of course, because of its convenient location - surrounded by shops! Great place to start a day full of shopping!!"}
{"text":"J'adore manger un bon brunch ici! Il y a des plats qui viennent avec tout, les patates, le bacon, les oeufs, un pancake et un gaufre!! C'est parfait pour tout gouter et j'adore les patates!! C'est un peu triste qu'on doive payer extra pour le sirop d'érable authentique, mais bon. J'adore les grandes portions!!"}
{"text":"On this beautiful Easter day, we went to Allo Mon Coco which is located by the shopping center Place Vertu. Luckily we got there early, the restaurant was packed and there was later on a waiting line who continued till the outside.

Servers were very quick, very friendly and helpful. One of us didn't want to order a plate that was too sweet, so the server recommended the Froma Fruit plater which completed her satisfaction.

As far as my order, I was craving some good steak since it's been a week I've been a vegerarian week . I had the American \"Steak and Eggs\" style. Steak was medium perfectly grilled and the swiss cheese that I ordered on my fries where extras (they'd add them if you request them). Tomatos had a gorgeous color and they tasted fresh :) Bol de café au lait was good too but it looks like a bowl of cappuccino to me.

This place is definitely worth it and we got our orders in a short amount of time! Which is amazing on a busy Sunday. Cheerz for the team :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service. No wait time at 10am on Christmas Eve...and coffee on the house somehow. The plates were huge and could definitely be shared because we all had leftovers. I got the deluxe waffle platter ($16) and it had both sweet and savory! Waitress was able to serve in both English and French and the potatoes are to die for. Others at the table got the guzzler, fruit platter and eggs Benedict, and all were satisfied."}
{"text":"INEXPERIENCED WAITRESS
nice restaurant and good food but the waitress made so many mistakes, Very unprofessional, 
1)  she took my soup away when I wasn't even finished eating it, she grabbed it so fast and walked away I had no chance to say anything.  
2) I asked  for a refill of coffee 2 times and she never brought it. 
3) from the beginning she forgot her dirty rag on my table, I don't understand how she came back and forth to the table several times and never realized her dirty rag is on my table right in front of her face.  Finally towards the end I let her know about the rag, she grabbed the rag, laughed and walked away. 
4) come time to pay, she charges me for the wrong item, ( Way more expensive) I had to wait a long time before I got her attention to explain it to her...
Anyways good food but horrible inexperienced incompetent servers! The owner should pay more attention to this!"}
{"text":"Beautiful, clean, delicious and friendly!!  I can't find enough adjective to describe this nice restaurant!!  Not only the food is delicious, but looks like an edible art!! 
The restaurant is tastefully decorated by the owners. It's bright and welcoming. 
There is plenty of free parking!

I will definitely come again and recommend it to everyone who loves breakfast:)"}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent. Had to wait a little before we were served, but it was busy. Will definitely go back.  Address is actually incorrect. It should be 
PROMENADES ST-BRUNO
111 Boulevard des Promenades , QC
Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville,
J3V 5K2"}
{"text":"We were seated very quickly and the service was good.  The waitress checked up on us regularly to make sure everything was going well. 

The portions here were huge, but it wasn't disgusting because there wasn't much grease to the dishes we ordered.  I ordered the American (steak and eggs) and had my potatoes topped with mixed cheese  (cheddar and swiss).  It was shredded cheese and once mixed into the potatoes, it melted perfectly.  

My wife ordered a crab cake benedict.  I took a bite and it was delicious.  A lot of good food once again all around.  My wife's cousin ordered an avocado wrap, although I didn't take a bite out of that, there was much of the wrap left when she was done.  She said the avocado wrap was very good.

My wife is looking to come back here already, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with my team.  I ordered the eggs and Italian sausages and had the French toast.   The eggs were ok, but the French toast was way too dry as they over cooked it.   Our waitress was also really slow with our order."}
{"text":"Brunch time and this place was packed! The wait was short and quick, there is quite a selection of items to order. I was in between getting the strawberry flambé or the deluxe breakfast. The waiter was very honest and stated the flambé can be very sweet and soggy so I went with the deluxe breakfast and was not disappointed! It came with a Nutella-strawberries and cream on waffles, eggs, potatoes, toasts and coffee and it was amazing! I really appreciated the waiter's honesty! The food came out VERY quickly! Loved the food and service! Definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"A delicious brunch!   I love the choices in coco breakfast. You can choose a plate with both sweet and salty stuff. However, they do not tell you that the cheddar cheese shreds in harsh potato is 2.50dollars! Also, the maple syrup is 2.50 dollars. Just be careful when they ask you if you need any thing. Two plates end up with 46 dollars. Pretty pricy......"}
{"text":"I don't know what all the hype is about this place. The service is slow and the wait to get in on weekends is so long. The staff is friendly at the location, but the menu offerings are no different than the many other breakfast joints on the South Shore."}
{"text":"Premierement, le service était horrible. On rentre, tout le staff nous regarde et personne vient nous acceuillir. Il y a 4 tables dans le resto. On va s'assoir par nous même et deux serveuses viennent a côté de nous et commence a jaser pour voir qui allait prendre notre table. Je veux dire... Allez ailleurs pour en discuter. Mon amie végétarienne voulait remplacer son jambon par des avocats dans ses oeufs benedictine et elle lui charge un extra 3$ sans essayer de trouver de compromis. Quand le moment arrive pour ecrire nos commandes, elle sort son cell devant nous et regarde ses messages et dit en riant \"desolee je dois toujours sortir mon cell pour prendre mon pad\". Je commande mon plat, mon amie toujours indecise lui demande 2 minutes pour reflechir. Au moment ou elle fait son choix, elle arrive avec mon plat. Au lieu d'attendre et apporter nos plats en meme temps, elle amene le miens des que mon amie commande. Ridicule. 
Bref, de loin le pire service que j'ai eu de ma vie. Je ne reviendrai plus ici c'est certain! 
La bouffe est bonne mais les portions minuscules pour ce que j'ai dans d'autres allo mon coco. C'est une chaine alors j'irai ailleurs pour des plus grosses portions et un meilleur service."}
{"text":"This is a franchise location and credit has to go to the franchisee. The decor is very nicely done, it's a very warm and inviting ambiance with nice large booths for pretty much everyone instead of tables. The franchise owner was at the front door greeting guests who were waiting in line, reassuring them the wait wouldn't be too long and just engaging in conversation. The menu has alot of great options, I was amazed at how fast the food arrived and perfectly prepared according to our requests, that's a testament to  well run restaurant and particularly a well run kitchen. I've been to other Allo! Mon Coco restaurants, but none as nicely decorated or with as good service as this one. If you're in the St-Laurent area, this is the place to go for brunch."}
{"text":"Best breakfast we've ever had. We ordered the Choco Coco and freshly squeezed orange juice during our first visit there. Incredible. The potatoes are partially mashed and SO good. On our second visit, I got a waffle with strawberries and English cream. Also incredible. The portions are huge and everything is prepared and presented with care. Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"This place is the upscale- Canadian- better version of iHop. I simply LOVED this place. There are endless options on the menu, the portions are huge, and the food is amazing. Each portion comes with so many different things such as fluffy toast, sausage, bacon, potatoes, a crepe or french toast or waffles, eggs. It's to die for!

I ordered an Iced Cappucino. Even though it came out with whipped cream and chocolate chips and was a bit too sweet for me, I really enjoyed it. My bf really enjoyed the freshly squeezed orange juice as well.

He got the fried chicken and waffles which came with egg, bacon, potatoes, and toast.

I got a plate that came with fried eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, a banana pancake, fluffy white toast, baked beans, and this Canadian version of pork paté. 

Everything was amazing. There's no wonder that so many people come here.."}
{"text":"So good! The potatoes are to die for! The fruit is fresh, the eggs are perfectly poached, the hollandaise is so flavorful without being salty and the omelette selection is vast. I like the atmosphere too, it's open and modern."}
{"text":"Petit déjeuner- brunch très copieux ( la Good morning vous tient jusqu'au soir!) dans un cadre lumineux . Carte variée pour cette chaîne bien implantée dans la région de Montréal.
La brioche à la cannelle est un régal , je conseille . 
La personne qui a pris ma commande était sympa comme tout , en plus d'un service efficace et professionnel , m'a indiquée ses bons plans pour profiter à fond de Montréal.
Le tout pour 18-19$tout compris par personne ."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place on the shore...even got a alcohol permit so you can enjoy some good Mimosa :)"}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat brunch with my best friend, the staff are really nice, there service are nice"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast! Food was delicious, very cool atmosphere, waitresses were very nice, service was prompt! Would definitely recommend and return."}
{"text":"had breakfast here while on vacation. The staff is very friendly I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict with potatoes and extra cheese it also included a huge bowl of fruits. The portions of the food was big, the Crab Cake Benedict was so good and so was the potatoes as for the fruit I was already way too full to eat it. I would definitely go back if in the area."}
{"text":"Je ne sais pas si c'est moi ou si c'est mon assiette mais c'est un des rares brunchs que j'ai fait ou j'ai eu du mal à finir mon assiette.... 

Bon plus sérieusement Allo mon coco c'est une chaine et je ne sais pas s'ils sont tous sur le même modèle mais celui-ci fait très moderne. Ce n'est pas forcement pour me déranger mais je trouve qu'il manque un peu d'âme. Par contre coté nourriture vous trouverez votre compte je pense. Certes ce n'est surement pas la cuisine la plus fine mais les portions sont plus qu'intéressante surtout pour ce prix.

J'ai trouvé le personnel vraiment sympa en plus de cela"}
{"text":"Un très bon restau à déjeuner pour ceux et celles qui habitent et/ou vont magasiner dans le dix30! L'endroit est toujours rempli, mais l'attente dépasse rarement 15 minutes et ça vaut la peine ! 

Les déjeuners sont délicieux et les assiettes sont géantes, vous ne manquerez pas de bouffe ! Je vous conseille les crêpes ou encore les omelettes, ce sont mes coups de coeur !"}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice. First impression, I love the overall decor. My first time was during the weekday, we we're greeted by friendly staff and the service was fast. The portions are generous that you may even want to share your plate with your friend if you don't have a big appetite. The menu has a good variety of options, which is always a plus when I'm indecisive. My second time wasn't so much of a great experience as I came on a holiday (Mother's day). The restaurant was packed so there was a waiting line to get seated. I usually ask to get my plates seperate because I like my food warm as it  should be but the waitress told me that they don't to that when they're on a rush etc. When I received my food, the food was a bit cold. Avoid going there on weekends/holidays."}
{"text":"This chain of diners are very popular.  They serve breakfast all day and it is usually pretty busy.   

I got the eggs benedict with crab cakes, they were good....they come with a great bowl of fresh fruit and a side of home fries/hashbrowns.

My BF got a pair of eggs with bacon and it was good.    

For a chain, it is good, dependable and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Not worth it for the price and service I ordered  something with my girlfriend last summer and paid 38+ tips wouldn't recommended for anybody!!"}
{"text":"So regardless of the service being good, my food was tasteless and expensive. I ordered a Toscana omelette and was awaiting a tasty Italian style breakfast but was served an oversized plain omelette with olive oil drenched cherry tomatoes on top. Forced myself to eat a third of it, wasted the rest. I nibbled on my boyfriends ice cream toped waffle which was so yummy in comparaison but at these prices, I should've just made it at home."}
{"text":"For those who like breakfast it's ok. 
It's a place for family and friends but not for meeting with your boss or employe. 
The style is like a retro and clean but when it's full it's to noise. 
About the food, they make big plate and everything but nothing with special taste to much commercial. 
The price is to much for what the food taste. They ask for the muslin if they eat or not porc because they put bacon in the patato they surved. I didn't like but maybe other will it's my opinion, bon appetit!"}
{"text":"When in Montreal, you gotta opt for this place. I'm always down for a good brunch and this spot does not disappoint. I always get the special which is $15.99 for 2 eggs, sausage, ham, bacon, potatoes, toast, beans and banana pancakes (which are my fav). The potatoes are really good too - not your usual hashbrowns or homefries... more like a smashed potato but still really good. My friend got the Copenhagen ($16.99) which are egg bennys on smoked salmon on top of english muffins with hollandaise sauce and a side of potatoes and a bowl of fruit. The portions are huge and the menu has a good selection. The service is always on point - no complaints really about the ambiance either."}
{"text":"slow service and they don't seem to give a damn about the costumers, they ask if you want cheese with your potatoes but doesn't tell you it comes with extra fees. Same with maple syrup. On top of that, the fresh fruits cup should maybe have fresh fruits, which was not the case. Would definitely not return"}
{"text":"Great food, large portions, and friendly service for an affordable price. No sacrifice between quality and quantity because you get both. Went on a Sunday morning at around 09:00, there was no wait. Staff was friendly and prompt, well versed in both English and French. We ordered an oreo-ice cream waffle, breakfast poutine with hollandaise sauce, and cappuccinos for some affordable post-traveling comfort food -- all of which was delicious. Only critique was the waffle was not warm when brought to the table, which is important to contrast the ice cream temperature; however, it did not detract from the overall quality of my experience and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Maybe it's me but I'm just not a fan of Allo Mon Coco. The potatoes are always too oily as are the eggs, the waiters always forgot something (like coffee), the food showed up cold. Like come-on man! It's eggs.
I won't be back, sorry."}
{"text":"Ce n'est pas de la grande qualité, mais ça reste un endroit sympa pour bruncher !

Comme souvent à Montréal, la carte est très complète et il y en a pour tous les goûts. Vous pouvez même demander à enlever / remplacer certains ingrédients que vous ne souhaitez pas manger (bacon par exemple). 

J'ai pu tester une assiette avec : 
- Deux pains à la cannelle : un peu sec, mais bons quand même
- Un oeuf miroir (vous pouvez choisir le type de cuisson)
- Des pommes de terre écrasées 
- Du bacon
- Plein de fruits : ce ne sont pas les fruits les plus goûteux que j'aie jamais mangé, loin de là. Mais ça rajoute quand même un côté rafraîchissant à l'assiette qui est quand même très fat !
- Du pain complet (au choix) : pas nécessaire selon moi car cela fait doublon avec les pains à la cannelle

Les assiettes sont très copieuses (un peu trop), mais au moins vous en avez pour votre argent (niveau prix, c'est très raisonnable)."}
{"text":"Good casual chain. Mimosas are 6.50. Prices are good, portions are large enough. Many options. Similar to Eggspectation perhaps a bit more upscale/trendy ambiance than eggspectation."}
{"text":"Mon premier essaie chez allo mon coco!! Ben oui je suis un peu en retard. Mais la j'avais envie de changer et il y en a un nouveau qui a ouvert ses portes cet été sur la rue ste catherine près de l'UQAM. Des que nous sommes arrivés j'ai trouvé l'endroit sympa, super coloré et on est venu tout de suite nous accueillir à la porte. C'est un peu bruyant, mais excessivement dérangeant... Le menu est vraiment complet, on en a pour tous les goûts. Personnellement, s'il y a bien un plat que j'aime prendre ces derniers temps pour le déjeuner c'est le burrito alors quand je l'ai vu sur le menu j'ai pas hésité. Mon copain lui a pris une assiette classique, ufs et viandes. Quand j'ai vu mon burrito j'ai été impressionnée, la taille du wrap était quand même considérable. Je me suis dit jamais je ne finis ça et en effet j'ai du le prendre pour emporter et je le précise afin que l'on comprenne qu'il était délicieux! Les patates en accompagnement légèrement pilées étaient succulentes, on ne me m'avait jamais offert des patates sous cette forme et c'est très original. Bref le repas à dépassé mes attentes, je vous le recommande fortement !!!!"}
{"text":"This a Québéc-based breakfast/brunch chain spot with approximately 20 locations throughout the province. A great place if you're looking for a hearty meal after traveling! Lots of variety. Go here hungry- the portions are hearty. I ordered the Mortabello grilled cheese- it was served with a lovely cup of fresh fruit and 'breakfast potatoes' which are served in such a way that Americans would call them \"smashed potatoes\". I'm giving this place 4 stars because the potatoes were a tad cold, which was disappointing and the service wasn't spectacular- We had to ask for more coffee and water a few times even though the place wasn't busy at all. Despite this, the waitress seemed stressed or distracted and mostly hung out near the kitchen- I think they may have been shortstaffed or something -but this isn't the type of place where you go for the service anyway- the food and value you get speaks for itself."}
{"text":"i came for lunch on a monday.  worse experience of life !!!!!! avoid this place at all cost. terrible service. lost waiter. place was empty. burger was gross. chicken wrap tasted like fake chicken or frozen chicken. 

told the waiter that my burger sucked (ate 2 bites) and he didnt even offer a rebate or something else.

avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"Cheap, reliable and close to my house. You might not tick off the third box, but that shouldn't prevent you from grabbing breakfast at Allo Mon Coco. 
 
It's not fine dining, but it's not a cesspit like Eggspectation or Chez Cora's. The food is more than edible and sometimes, that's really all I'm looking for. PLUS, all of their Eggs Benedict plates come with a mountain of fruit. And we're not talking cantaloupe here, brother... there are fancy fruits in there too. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, the service is pretty fantastic - they're quick, friendly and have a great eye for refilling empty coffee cups. 10/10 service in a chain restaurant is an undertaking worth writing Yelp about. 

My one reservation with this place is their hashbrowns. Those aren't hashbrowns, my Coco. Those are mashed potatoes heated up on a flattop."}
{"text":"Overall OK food. 
The place is nice and clean, the terrace also accommodates quite a lot of guests. 
The wait time was definitely great compared to the other brunch places around. 
It's definitely not the best brunch in town, nor the best quality for the price. The crepes are ok but too thick, the service was super slow even if it was 2pm. My friends had omlets which they recommend. The servers are friendly. 

I wouldn't recommend this place if you are a true foodie, but if you need a quick lunch it will be ok. I probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"As an American, all i can say is that less than happy with our egg benedict. 

Hollandaise was like glue, more like a thick gravy then a light sauce, the fruits were yummy but i'd wished the egg benedict was on par.

The place was very busy and service was slow and unattentive. Nice looking restaurant but definitely needs some work."}
{"text":"Just like how they describe themselves - Allo Mon Coco puts a modern twist on breakfast. Beautiful restaurant, well lit, presenting stylish decor and color combinations along with delicious food.

Came here on a Sunday morning, it was packed, line was out the door and wait time was around 20 mins to have two people seated. Knowing how busy it gets, they did a great job hiring a magician that entertained customers in line. I didn't even notice I was waiting.

I ordered their \"Sunshine\" dish which consists of 2 eggs, bacon, baked beans, pancake filled with fruit and English cream, potatoes, toast & coffee - all that for 11.95$
A classic choice that feels complete. I've never had English cream in my pancakes before, felt like I was eating a desert since it was so weighed down but I loved the texture and mix of sweetness and salt with my meal. The potatoes are unique compared to other breakfast places I've been to, they're mashed seasoned hashbrowns.
Also loved the strawberry milkshake which was rich and frothy, didn't help me from feeling full so fast though!

If you're visiting Dix 30, must come here, it's the best business in the Square."}
{"text":"La bouffe est correcte mais sans plus , bouffe typique d'Amérique du nord , pas adapté les végétariens , service très très rapide et les serveuses super sympas. J'y retourne peut être . Je trouve que dans chaque plat y a du beacon ou jambon et c'est vraiment pas adapter pour les personnes qui mangent pas de porc"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on a Saturday morning and as expected there was a long lineup. However they were really organized. Although the prices were high, the portions given more than made up for it as we had trouble finishing are plates. They have a generous variety of fruit and the potatoes are delicious!"}
{"text":"Je suis arrivée vers 10h et j'ai attendu 10 minutes.
Les portions sont généreuses et il y a plusieurs mets qui sortent de l'ordinaire. C'était délicieux ! J'ai pris une omelette portobello et proscuitto et c'était vraiment bon ! Ma sur a pris le Good morning et il y avait beaucoup de fruits, frais et bien mûrs !:) il semble y avoir beaucoup d'attente de 11h à 12h-12h30 par contre. Le service était bien."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say about this place! Definitely the best breakfast I had in Montreal.

I used trusty Yelp to find a place for breakfast and seeing the pictures and reviews, I knew I had to come here and it did not disappoint. It was a bit of walk from the hotel were I was staying and it was a rainy and miserable day but I did not care and had to come here.

I'm so glad I did but everything was delicious. They had so many options and I had no idea what to get until I saw the Choco Coco. Ugh so good! The latte was amazing and my boyfriend also loved his breakfast.

If it wasn't for the fact that I wanted to try new places for my stay, I definitely would have come back.

You will not be disappointed and the reviews and ratings for the place speak for themselves!"}
{"text":"Enfin un resto à déjeuner à la jonction du Quartier Latin & du Quartier des Spectacles...ça manqué...j'aime bien les restaurants indépendants pour les brunchs \"fancés\"...mais quand je veux le classique  \"deux oeufs + bacon + café filtre\" je vais dans un dîner ou dans une chaîne à déjeuners comme ici. Nouvellement ouvert depuis juin, assez spacieux & propre, service correct des serveuses. J'ai adoré la purée de patates, ça fait changement de la compétition. Sinon, rien d'extraordinaire, une chaîne à déjeuners comme les autres mais il y avait un manque dans ce secteur à mon avis. L'endroit est remplit le matin de travailleurs de la construction et en après-midi de touristes internationaux. 2 oeufs + bacon + café filtre = 11,44$

4/5 visité en juin/juillet 2017"}
{"text":"This was a cute diner vibe with huge portions of food and decent pricing. Our waiter was really great. There were free coffee refills that were offered regularly. Every single plate came with a giant helping of assorted fresh fruit. (Not just the typical cantaloupe and grapes combo that I hate.) There were like 16 kinds of Eggs Benedict and fresh squeezed juice. Definitely worth every penny!!!"}
{"text":"If you long for a classic brunch meal and you are really, really hungry, this is the place for you. There's no hipster food served in minimalist quantities here. It's almost surprising and at the same time refreshing to see them open their doors in the Plateau. 

When I got there, around 1pm on a Saturday the place was in full swing, but luckily we got a table after just a few minutes' wait. Table service was friendly and efficient. There was something on the menu to please everyone. I ordered the Lac St Jean breakfast, which consisted of two eggs, three slices of bacon, their famous potato mash, fèves au lard, creton, a massive blueberry pancake and toasts. Coffee or tea included. The amount of food in front of me was quite monumental to say the least. The mash was surprisingly tasty despite the ghetto appearance, but the creton was very run of the mill. Oh well, there were definitely other things on the plate to satisfy my palette.

My date ordered the breakfast poutine and although in the end it proved a bit too much, he enjoyed it. I didn't dare try it though. There's something that screams \"get out of the pool!\" about poutine dressed in hollandaise sauce, at least to me.

So I like this place because I got what wanted at reasonable prices. The only thing that I'm not a fan of is their decor. It's too bright, too shiny, too leathery. Like my date said, \"It feels like an airport.\""}
{"text":"Clean, modern decor, food is plentiful, well presented and quite good ( ask for the real maple syrup which costs a fraction more) but the customer service is a little unfriendly. Not sure whether because we couldn't converse in French( which seems to be the local pet peeve here) Nevertheless we shall return!"}
{"text":"Visited while traveling to Montreal. This Montreal diner is better than most American restaurants - we enjoyed our food and had a nice, tasty, filling meal. My husband really enjoyed the crepe with berries and English cream.

What we appreciated most was that our server was willing to accommodate our language needs, switching over to English for me and even helping my husband  practice his French while he ordered (his idea).

Great overall experience."}
{"text":"You can't wrong here, the options are endless, portions are large, and the food is absolutely delicious.

Try their breakfast poutine, it's a spin off the classic poutine dish made with breakfast potatoes. Breaking open the yolk over the gravy and you have one mouth watering dish.

I had the gourmet eggs benedict with mushrooms and it was amazing. I couldn't finish the plate because it was so big. We also tried the crepe with fruit and Nutella and English cream and it was delicious.

They also have great mimosas! And were willing to make a variation of the options on the menu. The decor was also bright and happy, the service was the friendliest I had anywhere in Montreal.

Absolutely a must visit for breakfast/brunch on the weekend or for lunch specials during the week!"}
{"text":"Only 3 month old at this location. Nice setting and a great menu selection. Potatoes was really good!! The fruit plate is huge!!! Great food but US size portions"}
{"text":"I had low expectations going in since it's one of multiple locations....and my experiences with chain-like establishments are usually less than stellar.

But Allô! Mon Coco should not be missed. First and foremost...it's extremely clean. There's also plenty of seating and the service is very friendly. The only glitch that we experienced was that one breakfast was served at least five minutes prior to the other. That said, I would rather receive hot and fresh food then allow one of the entrées sit under hot lights while the other is being prepared.

One of the special omelettes was ordered that contained brie, caramelized apples and bacon. The side of potatoes was a small mountain along with a couple of slices of fresh fruit. Great reviews on said omelette. It was also served with very thick slices of buttered toast and plenty of spreads to slather.

I decided to go all out and order a platter of food that had a little bit of everything: banana/chocolate hazelnut crepe, eggs, potatoes, fresh fruit and bacon. Oh yeah, and it's served with a side of toast as well. Sweet and savory? Yep.

Everything arrived hot, fresh and cooked to order. (I asked for the potatoes to be a bit more well done and they were..without burning 'em!). Great quality on everything. I would absolutely come back here for breakfast or brunch when I'm back in town.

I completely went over my calorie limitation for the day already....but who cares. It's Sunday and I can either pray for redemption or just do a few extra sit ups later.

Merci beaucoup!"}
