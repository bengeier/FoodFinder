{"text":"There was about 20 people in line and they only had 2 employees and the express drop coffee line wasn't open. A drip coffee was $5. Amazingly, the employees were still nice and the coffee tasted good which earned them 2 stars. I could have walked 2 minutes to Starbucks outside the casino and got a coffee faster and for half the cost. In fact, that's exactly what I did the next morning."}
{"text":"They don't know how to make real latte. Latte is not suppose to get any foam on top, it's suppose to be a creamy texture like the picture you are showing (wrong advertising) and food is not that great."}
{"text":"My wife and I went took Frappe Mocca and a Cold chocolate.
It was excellent and a very short line (we waited maybe 2 minutes).
The day after we came back and we still loved our choices.
Very good flavors and for a quite reasonable price.
More flavors than Starbucks definitely... 
Employees were very kind and helpful.
We cannot wait to drive back there and have our drinks."}
{"text":"I like this place better than your average Starbucks.. reason being in terms of quality, I feel like LavAzza provides better service and quality of coffee.

The menu consists of a regular coffee cafe menu. It can get busy and there aren't too many employees. Thankfully I caught them at a slow time!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased to see that there was a LavAzza at Bally's when I stayed there recently. It's located on the casino floor right near the front desk, so very convenient to grab something on your way in or out of the hotel. They have a pretty standard coffeehouse menu, but I feel the quality is superior to larger chains such as Starbucks. Although the food in the case looked delicious, I opted to get a regular latte. If I stayed longer, I probably would have come by here again...it was delicious! Espresso has a great flavor."}
{"text":"My husband and I both loved the iced-blended drinks at Lavazza. It's definitely our new favorite spot to cool down next time we visit Vegas during the summer. The staff working here was super sweet, and we appreciated them. I'm now craving a mocha frappe just thinking about this place! :)"}
{"text":"I wonder if this is under new ownership or a new company. I'm been going to this coffee spot for a while now. It has an amazing cup of coffee and people wait in line for for their pastries.

They do have a coffee only express lane but I never use it.

The employees are very pleasant and keep the line moving. It can get very busy here since Ballys does not have a Starbucks.

Before it wasn't 24hours ,but I guess now it is. You'll pay the strip tax for the coffee but cheaper and better thank Starbucks in my opinion."}
{"text":"I tend to not like very strong coffee, and was weary as this is the same brand of coffee that my parents get, but I was pleasantly surprise. It's been awhile, but I believe I got a decaf caramel latte with soy milk, while my mom got a cappuccino with soy, and we shared a chocolate croissant (?) and plain croissant. 

I found the drink to be right for me (though my mom tried it and said it was a bit sugary, but I don't taste sugar that great so it didn't matter to me) and it was a nice change from Starbucks and Jean Phillippe's. 

The pastries are the reason I won't give a better review. They just were flat, especially the chocolate one (though better than the chocolate almond from Jean Phillippe's). They were not inedible, but just not great either."}
