{"text":"Taste and quality: ordinary. Portion size and value: Moderate to poor. Prices: overpriced. Service: Average. Several more affordable lunch restaurants and cafés have opened for people who work in the area, but this restaurant has maintained overpriced meals as if they were the only option."}
{"text":"I was concerned by the mediocre star ratings of this place so I didn't try it, despite it being in my building.  Then, one day, I didn't have time to rush out to get lunch. So I stopped by to get a vegetarian quiche and a salad.   Verdict: Both are great. The quiche portion was large and the flavour was just right-- subtle yet perfectly hearty. The side salad was small, but it had the right amount of veggies and dressing.   This place is understated and simple. It's not as gourmet  or ambitious as the nearby places like Van Houtte, Olive & Gourmando, or Le Cartet. But it's not trying to be. It's just a regular lunch place with some simple, stable, healthy choices.   Also, Yelp has this place listed as an \"Italian\" restaurant, which it most certainly is not. I don't think it should be called Pasta Cafe. It's more of a quick French bistro than an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Un menu trés ordinaire, un service sans motivation et à la limite de l'arrogance. Et des prix de la cité du multimédias. Il y plein de meilleur choix dans le coin. La quiche aux légume tiède a pris beaucoup de temp pour sortir et la salade César qui l'accompagnait avait le minimum d'ingrédients nécessaires pour avoir le nom.  Juste sourire aux clients, ça me crèverais pas le budget et cela améliorait tellement la situation."}
{"text":"A hidden gem for your morning latte, a few blocks from Starbucks and Van Houtte. It's beautiful and cozy. The owner is awesome and the staff too. Seems very popular at lunch time and they have a good selection of meals for workers in the area. Cash and credit only, no debit."}
{"text":"I like the decoration , the big windows , the food is ok , of course over priced we are CLOSE to old Montreal after all. Nice terrasse available. Bcp de tables. Screen for sports."}
