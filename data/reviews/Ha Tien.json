{"text":"Good neighbourhood food. Get the spring roll and BBQ pork pho!  Pass on the bubble tea. Salad rolls are good too. Kids like it too"}
{"text":"Ha Tien is a fantastic little Vietnamese restaurant I discovered it on my way home one day. The owners are lovely! The service is great and the food is wonderful! My husband and I eat there at least once a week. The portions are a good size. If you're a fan of Bubble Tea...be sure to try the Tarot Coconut. Yum!"}
{"text":"I had first visited this restaurant about a week after they first opened a few years ago. I am a huge Vietnamese food lover and was tired of driving 30 minutes each way to the one in my old neighbourhood. I was so excited to see these guys open 5 minutes from my new home. That first visit had been pretty underwhelming at best so I went back to my old favourite despite the drive. Tonight I was just tired and didn't feel like going that far but was craving Vietnamese like crazy. I decided to give these guys another chance and I'm so glad I did. I ordered the BBQ pork with spring rolls on rice verm which is my favourite comfort food. It was amazing. I will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Very impressed by the service and food, we have received here. We decided to have my father's birthday dinner here. We were a group of 14, including 4 kids under age 7 and a baby. I have been to many high end resteraunts and with a group this size, the server can get overwhelmed quickly. Especially when people are moving around to different seats and separating onto separate bills, amongst 5 groups. This did not even phase our server nor did it confuse him or lower the quality of service we received. There was not one mistake with the orders, bill etc. did I mention that we had one server who was serving us and any other tables in the resteraunt?He was patient with the children and older adults and very friendly and polite. Our food was fantastic and brought out timely. He even brought out the cake and sang, \"happy birthday,\" with us. We felt so welcomed here. It feels good to experience truly good service. My father had a wonderful evening and everyone left happy. One last thing I would like to mention, I really appreciated the fact that as the meal went on, our server was continuously removing our used dishes, napkins, etc etc, from the table. So we were always eating off a neat and tidy table. I wish more resteraunts and servers would take this much pride in their business. Thank you so much for making this a great evening! We so appreciate it."}
{"text":"We love it.  Husband and I go from time to time.    Service is amazing, they always accommodate my weird diet of the week or, not ordering anything except hot water and lemons, or only ordering shrimp and veggies etc.   Whether we order with restrictions or the original version, it's always delicious and they don't have MSG in everything (only in one or two items but they are good about telling you which ones so you can avoid them).    Their new curry dish is amazing!  Delicious food without the MSG, just ask for it."}
{"text":"I had the house special soup #11 and it was very good. The large was of a good sized and had generous portion of meat. My wife had #15 Brisket and tendon and was also good size.   The broth was tasty without other sauces but of course you have to add chili sauces, lime, and Basil.   Worth a visit to be sure."}
{"text":"We ate here multiple times over the past year due to the good reviews. Never has the food been more than below average in quality, but it was convenient so we kept coming back when we craved Vietnamese and didn't want to drive too far. We will NEVER eat here again....My husband ordered take out for himself last night (Bun Dac Biet + Hoanh Thanh Chien) and had FOOD POISONING last night."}
{"text":"Have never had a bad experience coming here, the family that owns it are very kindhearted. As for the review of a person getting food poisoning, I find it highly unlikely. I have seen their kitchen too and they keep it relatively clean. Their food is quite tasty as well. Not the best albeit but good nonetheless. I would recommend this place to my neighbourhood friends in a heartbeat. Love the spring rolls. RECOMMEND THE BUBBLE-TEA AND VIETNAMESE SUB COMBO WITH EXTRA SIDE OF SPRING ROLLS!"}
{"text":"Disgusting food. Saw the review of basa hot pot to tried it. Don't do it. There was disgusting gooye stuff in the juice I ordered. Awful service"}
{"text":"Nice family restaurant, the best hot pot in the city. Always good food and a friendly hello."}
{"text":"We order Vietnamese food from here regularly and we love the food. Last weekend we tried a highly rated restaurant in the NE and it wasn't as good as Ha Tien. Happy this place is close by and convenient. The staff is also always nice and able to let you know the ingredients of any dishes. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I come here on a weekly basis.  I love pho, and its hard to keep me always going back to one place so they are definitely doing something right.  The staff are extremely friendly and welcoming. The dishes are well portioned and prices are great!"}
