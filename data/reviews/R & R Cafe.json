{"text":"Perfect place to get work done! Very friendly people and really good food!!! Food is just like Starbucks but the prices are much lower! I loved this place! I never have a issue here! Always get my work done!"}
{"text":"Drinks are good, Cakes were stale and hard, not a fan at all. Employees could have been more professional as well."}
{"text":"Service is mediocre at best"}
{"text":"I would give this place a -10 if I could. We made a special trip here to look for minced meat treats... they advertised minced meat treats on their website (as seasonl for November and December) We tried to call several times but no answer.  I guess it also doubles as a spa? weird. The girl working there was clueless and the place was very unorganized. All that and no minced meat treats"}
{"text":"This place is under reservations at the moment. I drove all the way to try this cafe only to realize it was closed. Please update if you're going to be closed"}
