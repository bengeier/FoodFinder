{"text":"My friend and I went here for lunch today. We got seated right away.. Took about 10 minutes for us to be greeted by our waiter. I ordered the curry beef stew and a honey dew slush. The curry had a good taste, but it had literally 2 pieces of meat and the rest was potatoes. We were done eating and we were waiting for the check... About 15-20 minutes."}
{"text":"They do NOT have many vegan or vegetarian options here so I had to customize my order. When I asked if I can order vegetables and noodles since nothing on the menu was vegetarian she said we only have cabbage and onions for vegetables. Not going to lie, I was mad that my carnivore husband picked here to eat but he figured every Asian place has vegetarian options but clearly nothing on the menu. So after several times of the waitress going back and fourth to see what the cook can do I order and ended up getting noodles, fried tofu and veggies. I was surprised when it came out because there were more veggies than expected but the tofu was gross ( silken cubed oily tofu ), noodles and sauce were bland and oily and veggies were covered in the oily bland sauce so I was not that happy with this place ! I probably will not be back here again."}
{"text":"The restaurant is close to my apt. I visit it a lot. Good Chinese food. I really like their dessert! And Taiwan beef noodle is the one I order the most!"}
{"text":"Good food and brought back great memories of. Hong Kong! Must try Hong Kong style milk tea!"}
{"text":"Hong Kong Char Chan Tan style, very authentic HK cafe food. Hard to find in Phoenix, good food. Take away one star because the Male Owner (from Hong Kong) doesn't care much about the customers. I know he owns the restaurant but that does not mean he can just pass all the work to his servers. He does not look like a decent person to me."}
{"text":"It's a minor miracle that a Hong Kong western style restaurant, or cha chaan teng, as Asian Fusion Bistro calls itself in Chinese (99????would open here in Tempe, joining venerable favorites like Asian Cafe Express ??? and Max Asia ???, but that's a testimony to the strength of our growing local restaurant scene. We've eaten here three times in the last two days, been favorably impressed by the whimsical decor, the spacious seating, generous portions of food and drink, and the friendly attentive service.   The menu could use some editing, as we're still discovering where the restaurant shines. The milk tea is authentic as is the ??, yuanyang, a unique Hong Kong mix of coffee and tea served with milk and sugar. Unusual starters like the spicy salt and pepper chicken cartilage (?????) and the beef pancake roll (?????, a northern style dish, were delicious. Baked rice dishes like the Portuguese chicken rice (by way of Macau, the Las Vegas of East Asia) as well as the chow fun/chow mein dishes tend to please, although the Singapore rice noodles could have been a bit drier and used more curry. The noodle soups, like the satay beef noodle soup, while big on wonton noodles instead of the instant noodles usually served in this staple dish, could use a bolder hit of satay beef flavor, and the shrimp wonton could benefit with a bit less pork and more shrimp. There is a surprising Sichuan menu, perhaps a nod to the increasingly mainland Chinese student population unfamiliar with Hong Kong style cuisine, but one item on there, the house special beef steak, #108, will have to await future reviews, as with the dessert menu.   On the whole we would continue to come back just for the baked rice dishes and noodle dishes alone, but hope for the continuous improvement of the menu. 3.5 stars. Recommended."}
{"text":"My friend and I came for lunch, we try their Hong Kong style milk tea, personally I think it was a bit on the light side, needed more tea flavour, it was sweeten nicely though, but definitely needs more tea.  I ordered the wonton noodle soup, don't bother with this, it looks good, but the noodle was over cooked and mushy, wontons were really bad, shrimps in it seems rotten.  My friend order Satay beef with rice, it tasted fine, except it was loaded with oil, by the time she was finish eating, there was a puddle of oil on the plate, and the portion was extremely small.  Not sure if we want to try this place again, menu has an overwhelming selection of things on it..too much maybe, we spent about 10 minutes just looking at the menu!"}
{"text":"My friend from China (an international student currently studying at ASU) was very excited to find  asian fusion café. She described it as a \"real\" Hong Kong-style Chinese restaurant. we started off by each ordering one of the slush drinks; she ordered the taro, and I ordered the watermelon.   Don't be deceived by the picture on their menu: There is no Boba available to go in the slush drinks. I wasn't concerned about that, however when I saw the Boba pictures I got a little bit excited ;)  Given that we also wanted to save room for some dessert, we skipped the appetizers and went straight to the main dish.  Tonight we ordered the Szechuan chili boil, with beef and fish. The dish is quite large and is plenty for two people. And it's served with a side of rice. I really love the beef, it was kind of sweet and tender the fish was also nice too. This dish also had sweet potato noodles which are really long and really stretchy and clear and glassy.  I would say the dish was not spicy, though I think I think it is intended to be on the spicy side. If you truly like spice I would ask to make it extra hot.   For dessert we ordered the walnut soup.  From what I've read this is traditionally served hot, but we chose to have it cold. I really liked it, and I'm not sure what to compare the consistency too. It's not as thin and liquidy as a broth, nor is it as thick as a custard. But I suppose it's about what you would expect if you were to put walnuts and milk into a blender. I liked that it was not too sweet! And it actually tasted more like hazelnut than walnut to me, which is an observation not criticism.  The wait staff at Asian fusion café were very friendly, and seemed to really enjoy their jobs! That always makes dining hours and even more pleasant experience.   I look forward to going back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and attentive service. Lighting was not too dim and the wallpaper plus open spacing made it feel like I was in a HK cafe.   Ordered the curry beef stew w/ rice, beef pancake roll, and spicy salted chicken cartilage. I enjoyed all, especially the curry. However I would warn that the chicken cartilage is not for everyone. Just like eating chicken feet, you eat the chicken cartilage for the taste and enjoy the process of eating around the bone.  For drinks I got a Thai tea. I used to think the best Thai tea was sold by Da Vang, but now I'm having my doubts. This Thai tea is lightly sweet and creamy that makes a hot day in Arizona bearable. The red bean slush isn't too bad either.   Pricing seems okay for a place close to ASU campus, and I will definitely be coming back to try the other items on the menu.  P.S. Be careful with the tables! I hit my knees a few times trying to get comfortable."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food!  They have many authentic dishes besides the americanized staples, try something new there!"}
{"text":"Yang Chow Fire Rice, baked Portuguese chicken rice, chicken cartailge, red bean iced drink, all were good. Will come again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! This restaurant gives you large portions for a good price.  The food tastes authentic and the ambiance is beautiful.  They just earned a loyal and repeat customer."}
{"text":"The green beans were great. Chili oil at the table for your use. Large portions. Check it out if you don't want American-Chinese food."}
{"text":"Super happy to find this restaurant in AZ!!! The food is super authentic! They are real Chinese cuisines! I visited them in March with my friends. It's their first time to try Hong Kong style cafe and they love it!! The servers were helpful and kind to explains the menu to them."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Asian restaurant we have ever eaten at...and we been across this nation, the island, and Europe. The most authentic food that doesn't have the western flavor to it that we normally get from Americanized Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Asian Fusion is relatively new spot that replaced Hazelrock Café. It's quite a transformation from the quiet, empty coffee shop. The proximity of the location to the ASU campus makes it an easy pick. The staff is really friendly and helpful when deciding what to choose from the menu if you are not familiar with some of the dishes. The spot seems to draw a lot of the Asian students from ASU which is a good sign. The food was delicious and large in portions. I absolutely loved the décor around the restaurant and the wall that depicts a Chinese district/street. It's a great place if you want some Asian food that's not fast food and close to campus.   Appetizer: Pot stickers- They were good but not fantastic at $4.99. Tasted about the same as the frozen pot stickers you can buy at the store.  Entrees:  1. Singapore Rice Vermicelli $9.99 - Delicious but I think a little dry. The flavoring and spice on the noodles were just right.  2. Chow Mein $8.99 - the noodles were amazing! I'd say it almost tasted better than Singapore noodles but I can't.   Dessert: Taro snow with condensed milk, red bean, and strawberries. Had good flavor and was enough to fill us up just right at the end of our meal. We had really wanted to try the Condensed Milk Toast because a friend recommended it, but we were too late since they stop serving toast at 4 or 5pm. I guess it's a tea-time thing."}
{"text":"Just went here for an impromptu lunch and was so glad I did! By \"fusion\" it just means they serve a variety of dishes from all Chinese regions. Even if that in itself is not authentic, I love that you can get Cantonese /HK style dishes along with a few Taiwanese and Sichuan style specialities in the same place. When I saw that they had (Taiwanese) beef noodle soup I had to get it. I'm from the Bay Area where there is a plethora of Chinese restaurants and Asian Fusion Cafe's was pretty comparable to what I could get back home. And especially for Arizona! For me, that in itself warrants 5 stars. The broth was flavorful, the chunks of beef were meaty and tender (with some good cartilage-y pieces thrown in), and the noodles were thick and appropriately chewy. The portion of noodles was generous - I'm stuffed! It also was just the right amount of spicy- mayyybe just a touch too spicy for me but that's probably just me. I wish I would have gotten the HK style milk tea (but I knew I was getting boba next door afterwards), as it looked like everyone in the restaurant ordered this. The other diners were almost all Chinese college students and young professionals and it was pretty crowded. Service was good- friendly and fast. There's an afternoon tea they do from 230-530pm too. I would def recommend this place and I'll be back! Wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Asian Fusion Cafe has a varied menu from \"American Chinese\" dishes to super authentic szechuan and cantonese dishes to desserts.  Yes, Yes.  A chinese restaurant who serves desserts other than a fortune cookie or pineapple pieces.   We had scallion pancakes which were nice but I wish they had more scallion in them.  What I totally loved about them was that THEY WERE NOT GREASY AT ALL.  Most of the time my hands are greasy from touching them.  Not these, Good job.    I went on the wild side and ordered one of my favorite things in life--Pig ears--LOL.  Yes, they had pig ears which arrived sliced thin in hot chili oil.  They were room temperature and were a good combination with the scallion pancakes and white rice.  I tried not to eat the chili oil because of the calories but the ears were flavorful enough without it.  The crunchiness of the cartilage was great and it is one of the things I love about pig ears-the crunch factor.    Hubby ordered orange chicken (one of the chinese American dishes) and found the crust to be intolerably thick.  They gladly replaced the dish for beef with broccoli (adventurous isn't he?). The beef and broccoli was a tad on the salty side so when we go again we will ask them to keep the salt down.   I found the server to be really helpful (since it was our first time) and gracious when we asked to return the orange chicken.  She even told us to take it home since they didn't want it to go to waste.  What a nice young lady!   We noticed lots of asian families eating here so clearly they are happy with the authenticity of the food.  Their menu has lots to choose from even if you are not the pig ears eating type.   We'll be back and next time we'll have dessert."}
{"text":"Came twice during some downtime and both times the food was very interesting. My first time order was the seafood udon. I'm not fond of udon but the broth and seafood both tasted really great. The portion also seemed bigger than normal but that may have been because of the types of bowls they use (which is a very stylish type!). The second time I ordered a simple chicken, cheese and rice dish which was actually very flavorful. It felt like a dish your mom would make when you were sick-- a nice, homey kind of meal like chicken noodle soup. It was also really filling! Both times the wait wasn't too long for my food and the atmosphere was incredibly calm and felt like I could stay there for a couple of hours.  Defiantly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Phoenix! I especially love their beef noodle soup, they don't go light on the spiciness. They have a lot of dishes to choose from -- reminds me of those Hong Kong cafes in the San Gabriel Valley in SoCal."}
{"text":"Pretty close to ASU - it's located in a corner of University and Rural. Big location with plenty of tables/seating area. Parking lot isn't as friendly though. Almost always filled.   I've ordered several things from their menu. Most frequent item is the baked pork chop with cheese over rice. I treat it as a comfort food - it's decent, but nothing special. Their beef noodle soup is mediocre - it's got the taste but not much meat. The beef wrap appetizer is kind of dry and doesn't play nice with my braces. Drinks/teas are artificial - tea swirl is right next door so I recommend holding off on the drink.  Friend tried the pan fried noodle which is pretty decent."}
{"text":"Would not get seated at a table because I was only one person?? Really there were 5 tables. I'm Not A Student I was planning on buying my per diem of $50.00. More than a table of 4 students! Not happy as I am a business traveler!"}
{"text":"Big portions for a great price friendly staff. Was glad I took a chance & tried something new. Great atmosphere! I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Very cheery and friendly staff.  Fun new foods I have not seen anywhere else.  Kid-friendly.  My husband and daughter shared a cheese-chicken-rice dish that was definitely not something I have seen at any other Asian restaurant.  The coffee-tea latte reminded me a bit of a Thai iced tea and like a London Fog.  The stand-out was my sour and spicy beef noodle soup.  Nice pickled vegetables, peanuts, fat noodles and tender beef.  Looks like some nice desserts too."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite Chinese restaurant in Phoenix. Their foods are very close to the style I'm used to when I visit Hong Kong. Their desserts are also some of the best I've had. Next time I'll make sure to stop by for their afternoon specials."}
{"text":"Great Hong Kong style cafe food. Hard to find in Phoenix area. Milk tea is authentic. Food quality is great. Decor is very nice."}
{"text":"Closest thing to authentic Cantonese food I've found in Phoenix area so far! Only had the Beef Chow Fun and HK Style Pan Fry Noodles, but it tastes exactly like what I grew up with in Las Vegas. I know Cali has better Asian food than Vegas, but it's nice to know we don't have to wait for our trips home to have good food. Will need to try other dishes before giving the place 5 stars, but I'm excited to have a piece of home out here."}
{"text":"My mom wanted to give this place a try so we had lunch here today. Surprisingly, my mom made it to lunch early today. She's usually 30 minutes late minimum.   This place is hidden in the corner of the plaza by Pastries & Chaat. Inside the restaurant, it seems like a more modern Chinese restaurant. Definitely a variety of Asian dishes that seem to be very authentic.   We ordered the scallion pancake beef wrap, 2 large bowls of wonton soup and some cheesy chicken dish that my sister wanted to try. The wontons reminded me of the ones I had as a kid - round with meat and shrimp. Definitely something I would get again.   The scallion pancake beef wrap was good but nothing stellar. We ordered it after seeing it on other Yelp photos. The cheesy chicken dish intrigued my sister so we got it with rice (had the option for noodles). It seemed more like a comfort dish. I'm not sure what region of Asia it's from but I personally didn't know Asians cooked with cheese. For dessert, my sister and I decided on the grass jelly with ice cream. I'm a fan of green tea ice cream so that was a plus.   All-in-all, I'd like to come again and try other dishes. With us celebrating my mom's birthday, they also gave us complimentary tiramisu which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"I've had the Taiwanese beef noodle soup and the twice cooked pork here. The twice cook pork had good flavor but the pork is cut too thick. I'd rate the dish below average. The beef noodle soup is above average for the Phoenix area. The restaurant is clean and contemporary. The passion fruit tea is pretty good."}
{"text":"Best Asian food in the Valley!!!! Staff is absolutely friendly and accommodating. You don't want to miss this gem."}
{"text":"I have visited twice recently. For us it's a hit-or-miss. The first time we had the baked pork chop rice dish and the seafood pan fried udon noodle dish and they both were good.  The second time we visited we had the won ton noodles and ordered the shrimp tempura udon bowl.  I ordered the udon bowl and I was expecting the Japanese style, instead it was more like pho, and was loaded with cilantro, which I hate. My husband generously let me trade soups. I enjoyed his won ton soup, but he though it was at best average. We went with other Chinese family members and they all thought it was average and there are other places that are a little better.    It's a very trendy place in a popular area, though it's not the best Chinese food we've experienced."}
{"text":"Compared to many of the other offerings in the area, Asian Fusion Cafe is pretty bomb. I tried three things:   1) Pork Chop and onions with rice: I wish the pork chop was not fried, but rather, pan fried as that lets the flavor of the pork mix with the onions. However, the sauce is pretty spot on. A must-get here.   2) Baked pork chop and cheese with rice: OMG SO GOOD. Again, I wish the pork chop was not fried, but rather pan fried, but that's just me being picky. The cheese and the pork chop go really well. I'm sure it would taste great with the spaghetti too. Wow.   3) Taiwanese style beef noodle soup: I came in with expectations of how amazing it would be because I've had some spectacular beef noodle soup from places in California. Did not meet expectations, but not a bad choice. The flavor of the soup was a bit tangy, and there were lots of different flavors, especially from the vegetables. Wish the flavor could have been more consistent with the beef.   If you're from the 626 area from CA, and wondering if this will satisfy the hong kong style cafe craving, it definitely will. This is a 5 star yelp review if I am only considering other restaurants in the area, but I know there are some Chinese restaurants in CA that provide better food. Nonetheless, this is a great choice, and I would highly recommend. Prices are reasonable, and service is excellent."}
{"text":"Asian Fusion is my Cheer's Bar because everyone knows my name! LOL actually it's embarrassing. So, I frequent Asian Fusion at least once a week, or maybe every other week, and I think I've tried most everything. And, this I admit they've done well, and that is almost everything is good to delicious! The wonton noodle soup is genuinely great, the fried tofu is scrumptious, the seafood udon soup is very filling, the chicken curry with rice a delight, and all their baked chicken/pork with rice/spaghetti dishes are a must try! Service can be hit or miss depending on how busy they are, and every time I go there in the evenings, they are BUSY! The whole western chinese fusion thing works, and you need to stop by!"}
{"text":"The best Asian food I have ever had in my life! The service was so kind --- there isnt any place like it! I ordered the Mongolian Beef and it was out of this world DELICIOUS ! The Mango smoothie was huge and yummy. I saw the other dishes people were ordering and suddenly I wanted French toast, too. This is my new Jam!"}
{"text":"They recently changed their menu, so it's now more authentic Chinese food(although they still have a section of American Chinese food). The food is Sichuan style. If you like spicy food, you will love this place(like I do)!   Service is great. Food comes fast. Restaurant is nice and clean. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice and had the fried rice + noodles on separate occasions, but I want to explore the menu more as there are a lot of offerings available. Overall I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food here and it's definitely authentic Hong Kong style food. This restaurant is in an area that I pass by often so I plan on coming back here again to try something different.  I do want to try their HK milk iced tea sometime, it looks great from the pictures."}
{"text":"This is a great asain restaurant! The server was nice and the food came out quickly. I had the kung pao vegtibles and tofu and was so impressed. Best tofu ive had in the area with amazing flavor. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm really happy I found this place for an odd reason and I'm glad I did. There's a walk in clinic next door and I was having horrible stomach pains and couldn't eat. They treated me and said I should try eating in half an hour. I walked the shopping center and found this gem inside an old coffeeshop. The décor is very chic and I was impressed that in the corner was a traditional party roundtable for parties and was even blocked off. Not bad for a casual dining space in a smallish location. The jasmine tea was delicious and the service a little rough but eager to please and friendly. I was surprised to see all these sandwiches on the menu but my Cantonese friend pointed out sandwiches are a leftover colonial thing in Hong Kong. It is a varied menu with very traditional items to western staples. I wish I had more to say about food but this was my first meal in a while and I wanted to play it safe with dumplings. They even steamed them for me which a lot of fast casual places refuse to do and fry them to death (looking at you Republic Ramen). $5.99 for six soft, tasty and luscious dumplings works for me. The interior really is pretty and the menu is huge, plus everyone was clearly an ASU exchange student speaking Cantonese so that tells you something. My review isn't good for just plain old dumplings but I will definitely be back for some spicy Szechuan when I'm feeling better. I was not risking dying for spicy pepper today. Looks great for dates if you see a show at The Improv comedy theater upstairs."}
{"text":"Glad I found this HONG KONG STYLE CAFE. Not many around Phoenix. They have all the dishes you would find at a Hong Kong cafe. I grew up in SoCal and missed going to JJ CAFE in the San Gabriel Valley area. Love the chicken wings and the beef pancake rolls! Their baked pork chop wasn't that great. I didn't get to try the desserts so I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I ordered a HK pan fried noodles yesterday, it was so tasty and semi-authentic of Asian food. As a first timer I'm pretty impressed with the Menu selections. So many variety and they all look so good. My 3 other friends ordered fried rice, haninani chicken w Rice and Beef satay on rice. And all of them looks delicious. Btw just FYI most of the food in the menu come with rice, it happened that one of the worker saw my friend's plate. He ate most of the rice before finishing the beef satay. Guess what, he offered him more rice with no charge. Portion was huge, price is fair. The place was clean and actually located next to Improv comedy spot. So I'm definitely will be going back there soon if I'm in the mood for some Asian Food and catch some laugh next door at Improv."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really cute and looks completely different from when it was Hazelrock!   For drinks we ordered the red bean slush and watermelon slush. The watermelon slush was really refreshing but my friend said her red bean slush had too much ice and wasn't that flavorful.  For our food we shared the beef pancake roll, yang chow fried rice, and beef stew noodle bowl with chow fun noodles. I really liked the flavor of the pancake roll. The stew was good and the broth kind of reminded me of a pho broth. The fried rice was good but nothing special, just a typical fried rice.   Overall, everything was delicious! I would come back again. The only negatives were my friend's red bean slush and the service when we wanted to get to-go boxes and the check, but it's also pretty typical for an Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"only 1 word to decribe this place. BLAND!! The iced lemon tea has no flavor. the curry squid is watered down. the portugede style chicken rice has olives and celery in it. so not right!!  Color is wrong and bland!!. maybe I am being too critical. But I can drive a few miles to Asian Cafe Express and get better food. I have to admit they just opened and I will try again in a couple weeks."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the milk tea here. Being asian myself, I'm used to California's quality of food there and of course this can't compare. But for Arizona's standards, it's not bad if you're craving some Hong Kong style meals. Ive had the Taiwanese beef noodle soup and the Hong Kong beef stew soup. The Taiwanese beef noodle soup had some taste but it could use a bit more. It just tasted like spicy noodles in broth. The Hong Kong beef noodle soup was good though, I usually love this kind of beef so that was satisfying. It comes with vegetables too, so the quantity is good. I usually don't come here for the food myself but I do come to just buy the milk tea to go. It's creamy and sweet. I've been told they put condensed milk and that would make sense since I love that stuff! If this was closer to me, I would get milk tea weekly!"}
{"text":"Ordered stewed beef, baked pork chop rice, baked Portuguese chicken rice, soy sauce chow mein, H.K. style rice rolls, wonton soup, chicken cartilages, beef chow fun, mango cake, and green tea cake. Everything is excellent except the beef chow fun was a bit bitter (too much ginger?), also suggested to add more soy source to it. Green Tea cake was impressive, many layers and there must be a lot of labor involved."}
{"text":"Not 100% authentic HK style cafe, but there is no other choice n Phoenix. Curry is more like Thai yellow curry, cutlet pork chop can use a little bit more flavor on the sauce. Over all the food is OK, service is excellent."}
{"text":"This place is basically a hong Kong cafe run by mainland people. That being said, when in a chinese food desert like Phoenix, this would be one of the places on the top of my list to go for a Chinese craving.  The milk tea was authentic and the menu lists all the standard fare of a HK Cafe. The food would not win any awards in the SGV, but in phoenix, I would put this as a solid GO TO for real chinese food."}
{"text":"Left sushi 101 hungry for lunch and discovered this new place right across from them. This place is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is fairly still new and I wanted to check it out since it's something similar to the places in Cali.   The restaurant is decorated pretty nice with Chinese theme wallpaper.  They had comfortable table seating with tolix style metal chairs and wood bench along the wall.  The space is pretty open as well.   The staff greeted us when we walked in and we were seated immediately.  They offer varieties of food, drinks and dessert in Hong Kong style and western style. The prices were all reasonably priced as well.  The entrees we ordered were beef chow fun, Hainanese chicken and beef noodle soup.  The beef chow fun beef was pretty tender and not too greasy like the other places. The Hainanese chicken was missing a tad of flavor and bit pinkish but was ok with the dipping sauce and rice.  The beef soup was ok as well.  The plates and bowls they served in were all nice too.  The milk tea were served both hot and cold.  I got it cold and it tasted pretty light.  The passion fruit green tea came in a tall Pilsner glass and was pretty good and light.  The brick toast we ordered was the French toast style filled with peanut butter.  It was served with whipped cream and strawberry.  It was pretty good and tasteful.  They forgot the fries and missed it so it was complimentary.  Overall,  I would recommend this place and will return."}
{"text":"The staff here is wonderful! I love pan fried noodles but didnt realise it came with shrimp until the dish came because I forgot to double check when I ordered. They took the dish back without being frustrated and gave me a new dish without the shrimp! I was visiting from NYC and these pan fried noodles were for sure on par with the places I go to there. The decor of the place is really cute too, its no surprise they won an award for Best Chinese Diner."}
{"text":"The staff are pretty nice. It is decently clean. Food is pretty good. It's not necessarily exceptional here, but it's good enough. All in all, a fine experience."}
{"text":"This is a nice little cafe with a variety of dishes. I decided to order the beef stew curry and it didn't disappoint. It wasn't too spicy and the portions were good. My friend also got the beef lo mein, and he loved it. This is totally an Asian spot because the entire place was filled with Asian customers. The staff also spoke various Chinese languages which was impressive.  Service was good and the food came out fast! Will come back again! And there's a boba place next door for dessert!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you are looking for real Asian food and NOT sweet-and-sour chicken.  The  pork chop dishes are all good with super-soft pork.  The ground pork over rice dish is also very good.  The taro smoothies use real taro rather than the powder you get everywhere else.  My only complaint is their tables are very uncomfortable as the table legs block the chairs and people's legs."}
{"text":"Crispy Noodles!  Two thumbs up but can use less salt.  Great dish nonetheless! Hainanese Chicken and rice.  Two thumbs up! Curry Beef.  My husband loved it! Peking Pork Chop.  My son loved it!  We found Asian Fusion on Yelp while in town for vacation and it was a great choice on our second night in Phoenix.  We came in about an hour before closing and during our meal, we felt a bit rushed with the wait staff asking us if we're ordering anything else and if not, if we can pay already.  Umm ... oh-kay!  We're willing to overlook that only because the food made up for it.  It's definitely worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Pretty bummed with the recent change in ownership as the menu has been downsized and my previous favs are no longer on the menu.  Not much of an HK style cafe anymore."}
{"text":"Just left from there, and was terribly disappointed. It was the blandest Chinese food I've had here. A frozen package of stir fry from Trader Joe's would be less expensive, wildly more flavorful, and not as greasy.   We got the orange chicken, beef chow fun, and potstickers. Best part were the potstickers... but rarely does anyone mess that up!   Go somewhere else! Plus it wasn't even the dinner rush yet when we got there."}
{"text":"Me and my wife decided to revisit this place today and boy was it a huge disappointment. We were looking forward to the Indonesian fried rice and fish balls but they were no longer in the menu. The ownership change cut down approximately 70% of the menu.   The food quality and quantity definitely isn't up to par from before. We ordered the Hong Kong beef stew; which was a bit bland for my taste. And my wife ordered the minced pork rice; which had barely any minced pork and the egg tasted a bit odd to her. To top all that off, the  Hong Kong milk tea was bitter as well.... one star"}
{"text":"OMG I'm so excited this place is right below my new office!  Came here for the first time and can't wait to go back.  It's rare to find an Asian restaurant with good food, good service, AND good ambiance.  Asian Fusion Cafe has all three!  Don't let the \"fusion\" steer you away!  The majority of the menu is authentic Cantonese/Szechuan/Taiwanese, with a small section of Chinese restaurant staples.  As a lonely Asian in the desert, I'm always looking for food that reminds me of home, so of course I get the Taiwanese Beef Noodle soup even though it's nearing 100 degrees outside.  It.was.so.good!!!!  The broth lacks some of the complexities of REALLY good noodle soup, but I get it, they're trying to appeal to a crowd.  You definitely can't get anything better in the valley.  It tasted enough like Momma Chen's cooking to keep me and my belly happy.  Our waitress was also so nice and excited about the menu.  She made some great recommendations that I can't wait to try next time I go!"}
{"text":"This cafe is true Fusion style. We ordered Shanghai style soy sauce duck as an appetizer and my mom said it tasted very authentic and reminded her of her childhood. Another app we ordered was the crispy tofu, very generous portion size and I am so thankful this wasn't the stinky tofu version.   As for entrees: we ordered Hong Kong beef chow fung and it was so delicious, not too oily and not too salty. For greens we ordered ours just blanched and light.  4 stars for good customer service (especially since this is a Chinese speaking place and they're not typically known for service) and regionally accurate food. It would have been 5 except the appetizers didnt come out before the entrees...  We will be back! And next time we will save some room for the yummy looking desserts and milk tea."}
{"text":"I went there with my gf on Wednesday. I wrote on the check totally number is 28.00. Today when i check my balance they charged 29.85. Worst place I have ever experienced in America."}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting and my co-worker recommended that we needed to go, so we did! It is tucked in a corner spot in Tempe off of university dr and rural road . I do like the whole set up of a rolling table where you can place the food in a group setting ! The food was amazing and surprisingly enough the food came out in less than ten minutes !  I guess this place has a express attitude with the local lunch people like ourselves . I dined on the classic orange chicken, we shared calamari, chicken cartilage, and rice . Thank you for the prompt service and fresh food !"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for dinner and ordered the salt & pepper pork chop and beef chow fun to split it. The salt and pepper pork chop was pretty good, but then again anything fried is pretty good. I agree with some other individuals on here, I wish the pork chops weren't fried because you couldn't really taste the pork chop and could only taste the bread crumbs. The beef chow fun would be pretty average if it even had beef in it (okay, there were THREE pieces). Now it's just \"chow\" because there's no beef and now it's just not fun anymore."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Really good fried rice!  It's very clean in the restaurant!  The staff is always friendly, too!   You get a lot of food for the money.  They don't over salt the food!  It's so nice to eat Chinese and not feel thirsty all night long!  Their tap water actually tastes good, too!   Definitely give it a try....they have a unique menu."}
{"text":"I was super excited to hear there was another Hong Kong western joint in town.  When I am in HK or Cali, I love going to them.   The menu is what I expected to have a mix of HK staples and with a western flair.  We had a table of 10.  We placed our drink orders and some of the drinks started to trickle our way.  But some of our drinks were missing, then repeat drinks started to show up.  We had to tell them 3 or 4 times what else we were missing.  Then 2 folks came a little late, I am not sure if they ever got them a drink order.  That should have gave us a clue what we have in store.  We had one person place our order, but we were ordering everything and sharing.  Good way to taste everything!!!  It was total chaos after the drinks.  They bought dishes that were ours, then dishes that were not our, then they brought dish that were repeats of the dishes we have already have, and then some of our dishes never came.  WOW....  If we were dishonest, we could have eaten a lot of dishes for free.   Only the desserts were correct.  Maybe they are better with smaller tables orders?  Here are all the dishes that I tasted.  We had more but I did not taste them all:  1.  Condensed Milk Toast:  Basically it is Texas toast toasted and has condensed milk for a spread, served with fries plus a hot milk tea.  I requested the hot milk tea be iced and I know I was paying an up charge of $1.  The toast was good, I remember the crust on the bread was suppose to be cut off.  The fries were good.  I got my drink but it was hot, I reminder the server my drink was cold.  It took about 10 mins before I got my drink corrected.  But the milk tea did taste legit.  2.  Scallion Pancake:  I like the flakiness and layers of the pancake.  The flavor was pretty good not it is not super oily.  3.  Beef Pancake Roll & Chicken Pancake Roll:  We got the beef pancake roll so it was flavored beef rolled in a scallion pancake.  The beef was very flavorful.  Our chicken pancake roll never came out.  We asked about it the server said she forgot to enter it in the computer, but at the end of the meal during dessert the chicken pancake rolls show up.    4.  Meat Sauce with with Spaghetti:  The meat sauce was super tasteless (watered down).  Simply just was NOT good at all.     5.  Baked Chicken & Cheese in Creamy Sauce with Rice:  This dish smelled and tasted delicious!  Chicken with bell peppers and onions in a cream sauce baked on rice and topped with a crusted cheese.  OH was da bomb!  6.  Hainanese Chicken with Rice:  The rice with the meal should be enriched by garlic and it's aroma.  I did not taste it.  The chicken was moist and flavor but a little red/pinkish on bone on some parts.  The dipping sauces were ok in flavor.     7.  Wonton Noodle Soup:  The wontons were ok but the noodles were not that good.  Normally the egg noodles are cooked al dente with a light crisp/crunch when it is done correctly.  The soup base was just ok too, more flavor is needed in the broth.  That makes a noodle soup fantastic good.   8.  Curry Beef Stew with Rice:  This dish was spot on.  Very freaking good.  The beef stew was tender and packed with flavor, then the curry sauce was made to perfection.  I loved this dish.  Makes me think I was in Asian again."}
{"text":"I seriously had high hopes for this place. I went for lunch today with my wife and son. We ended up ordering the French Toast, Beef Pancake Roll, and Baked Fish Fillet and Cheese Rice. Once we ordered that is when all the troubles started. The dishes took forever to come. We asked twice for the status of our food, even as other patrons who came after us received their dishes first. After a long extended wait, we finally got our Beef Pancake Roll which was not oily but lacked flavor. The Baked Fish Fillet and Cheese Rice was hot but also lacked any flavor whatsoever (really just tasted like congee. Lastly, the French Toast that came out while pretty good flavor wise, was cold. They tried to give us food that was not even for out table (apparently it was curry meant for another table), insisting it was ours until another employee corrected the waitress. Overall, tasteless food and extremely long wait times really killed it for me at Asian Fusion Cafe. I would highly recommend not coming back unless you want to spend endless time waiting and then eat some cold, flavorless food."}
{"text":"This place is adorable. I mean honestly, so so cute. The wallpaper and overall aesthetic is amazing! However, the food made me sad. The crispy fried tofu was bland and didn't have good texture. The chicken wings were better, but they were just average. The only real seasoning was little diced peppers, garlic, and onion sprinkled over the top of these fried dishes. Not great."}
{"text":"Had Kung pao chicken and it was greasy and had some non chewable spices that they put in? The place was empty which is not a good sign! Service is fair but they seem to rush you in ordering your food for some reason! Also, a big rush in picking up our glasses and plates up at the table including the iced tea I had, they do it so fast , you don't have time to say no! Food is not so great also!"}
{"text":"Okay, if anyone wants to get a good feel of what you would eat in Hong Kong, you should come definitely come here.   The menu is huge, but everything we've ordered has tasted pretty authentic. My mother makes amazing Chinese food, and we normally don't eat out at Chinese restaurants because, well, she makes it better.   Well, she comes here quite often. That says a lot.   Their HK style milk tea is very good, red bean slush is really good, and their mango tapioca dessert soup is very good. Besides the sweets, their food is good too, ha.   I love me some sesame and orange chicken, but here you can find food that you would actually find in China or Hong Kong."}
{"text":"I had been passing this place by for two months on the way to Tea Swirl, when I decided I would gather my courage and try this place myself. The prices are pretty high, but that is understandable when it comes to fusion cuisine places making specialty foods. The dishes I have tried so far are the curry fried rice, Hong Kong style French toast, condensed milk toast, shaved snow, and Hong Kong milk tea. The curry fried rice was excellent, the right combination of spiciness with flavor. The French toast and condensed milk toast were interesting, having a filling makes them taste like a pastry. I appreciate Asian Fusion Cafe for having a greater variety of shaved snow and is the only place I am aware of near ASU Campus that has more than two flavors. The Hong Kong milk tea was great, especially with a spicy dish. I could taste black tea, condensed milk and evaporated milk, all components of Hong Kong milk tea."}
{"text":"Really love the nice, cute, and authentic decor (recognized some of the stores in the wallpaper from Hong Kong)! The food is pretty good; here are some of the dishes we've tried: - baked fish filet with cheese over rice - beef brisket in curry sauce (needs more beef though) - grilled pork chop (consistently delicious) The drinks are a little pricey but are worth a try. The iced red bean drink has a strong coconut taste, but is still refreshing."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to try this last week.  The service was rather quick and the waiter was nice and took the time to explain a couple things we had questions on.  The place is about a medium size restaurant and being in the Cornerstone area, close to ASU, I can see this place filling up quick.  The place reminded me of something you could find in LA, which I thought was nice.  The food was good for the most part.  We ordered the scallion pancake, beef roll, Hainanese Chicken, Satay Beef Pan Fried Udon Noodles & Szechuan Kung Pao Chicken.  The scallion pancake was too doughy for me, not like I am use to having and the Beef roll was way too doughy, definitely not prepared properly and not a fan.  The Hainanese Chicken was prepared well; however, the rice was too yellow (not sure if saffron or what) and the sauce for the chicken was not prepared the way I'm use to having it.  I'm not a fan of Udon noodles, but my friend wanted that...but the Szechuan Kung Pao chicken was the best I've ever had...I don't normally order, but glad I did...it was well seasoned and I would order that and try other dishes myself.  Will be back since I go to Tempe frequently.  The one suggestion I have for their menu on line here...make it available for the user to move it forward...do not auto advance.  it's very difficult to see the menu, if you want to know what they have."}
{"text":":| GG guys. They changed owners, it's no longer a Hong Kong, Cantonese tea cafe thing. *siiiiiggghhh*   They have like a couple of the same things, but most of the \"Gong Sic Chan Tang\" or the \"Western style Asian food\" is all gone. So no more cheesy pork with tomato sauce over rice, none of the other pork chop stuff with noodles and etc. Basically none of the stuff that made me so excited.   Now it's mainly like the same old spicier Sichuan stuff that you find in most of the other Chinese stores. If that's the way you roll, then have at it. But for me, it's a sad day and a step in the wrong direction  goodbye OG Asian Fusion Cafe  R.I.P."}
{"text":"One of the best Hong Kong restaurant in USA I came here for photo shooting in Grand Canyon and i was looking for a quick dinner place so i came here. I live in Los Angeles, However, i would say this place beats all Hong Kong restaurants in Los Angeles. The food is surprisingly good, 100% authentic Hong Kong taste. It is an excellent dinning experience in this lovely place, would come back to Phoenix just for this place"}
{"text":"Authentic Hong Kong Cha Chaan Teng.   My husband and I were in town and stopped by. As someone who lived in Hong Kong for a year and my husband who is from Hong Kong we thought it was pretty good.   The set up is cute and similar to the old style Hong Kong cafes. There's a cool mural on one wall that pictures a lot of things from Hong Kong. The staff was nice and provided good service.   The menu is very similar to what the restaurant name applies, fusion, it's very Hong Kong style with both Asian and western influence. I ordered the pan fried udon noodles and felt like I was back in Hong Kong! My husband ordered then beef pan fried noodles, this dish can be hard to make good but they did a good job at it and I would definitely order it again. There are so many options on their menu to try, they have a tea set menu that has a pineapple bun we didn't order it but this is a favorite Hong Kong pastry of mine and I would love to go back and try it!   If you are looking for some Asian food and want to try somewhere new go here!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience. Big portions or big servings. The only concern was their drinking water tasted weird."}
{"text":"VERY good authentic food.  We had the twainese beef noodle soup.  It was full of flavor but only a few huge chunks of meat.  I'd rather have smaller pieces in every bite.    The salt and pepper calamari was FANTASTIC!!!!  We didn't need to add anything to enhance the flavor.    Will come back and try other items."}
{"text":"Asian Fusion lives true to its name. The menu spans many different regions of Asia, with many popular dishes indicative of the region.  We came here for an early dinner and ordered the Taiwanese beef noodle soup and the Hainanese chicken rice. Both came out in a few minutes. The Hainanese chicken rice had tender chicken (Thigh and leg) and came with three sauces. In general it was OK but I wasn't particularly wowed by it. I would have liked some more oomph in the flavor of the ginger garlic sauce. The vegetables in the meal, while tender and well cooked, were also not thoroughly washed as I got bits of grit when I chewed on them. This dish is so simple, relying on a fine balance of delicately flavored chicken and rice with bolder sauces that everything rests in the technique to make it an outstanding meal. If an element is off it really affects the whole composition of the dish as a result.   The Taiwanese beef noodle soup had a spicy kick to it and was filled with thick noodles and tender beef. The flavor was more bold than the chicken. Overall it was decent but I've had richer broths at other restaurants for this dish.  I also had a Hong Kong style milk tea. It was served in a Mason jar and was lightly sweet and refreshing.  Service was good and we were checked on as needed.  The menu is quite extensive so despite not being particularly enthused by what we ordered I'll give then another try to see if I like the other dishes better."}
{"text":"I came in on a Saturday night and the place was very busy. The parking lot was very full and I had to park far away possibly due to Ralphie May doing a comedy show at the Improv, but that is not their fault. They quickly sat me down and got my order and were very nice. I ordered Sprite and Portuguese chicken with rice. The temperature inside was at a good temp and the decor was okay. Pop music played at a good range. The waitress was very friendly and helpful.  When I got the food though it was just ok. I think it was good and I do recommend it, but it was really standard fare."}
{"text":"Loved this spot Atmosphere 10 Food 10 Service 10  Loved it!!!!  Unique and fresh restaurant! Glad I found it!"}
{"text":"Very exciting about the opening of this new restaurant. Love the wall paper which is very Hong Kong Style.   The Taiwan style beef noodle soup taste awesome. The Southern sea chicken are also delicious. Best of all, the Hong Kong style milk tea is a must have too."}
{"text":"This place is awesome when you're craving some pretty authentic Chinese food. Their shaved ice cream is spectacular but I highly recommend the green tea flavored one. They were out tonight which was kind of a bummer. This food is delicious as always & the servers were attentive. I like the fact that they all got together to eat dinner towards the end of the night. The food didn't take long to be prepared but appears to be fresh. Definitely will be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"We had really good food experience at this restaurant. The Hunan chicken is soft & juicy. The kingpao chicken really bony but it s juicy. The wonton soup is good w shrimp & meat inside, not too much skin. We end up with the black sticky rice in milk sauce & mango. It it delicious! The service is really good !! This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix from now on!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times with my friends,  I have gotten the Kong Pao chicken, twice cooked pork, etc. The service was ok, maybe a little aggressive the second time I went. The food taste like it's from any average Chinese place, nothing special. The cost of most of the dishes were above $10 which is an atrocity consider the amount of other great Chinese restaurant around here. I wouldn't suggest anyone to come here for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Ice cream was great along with the mango and grass jelly.   Service: exceptional Food: wow Place: fancy"}
{"text":"Dude.  Consistently great food and super friendly waitresses who will offer to-go cups for any drinks ordered during your meal.  Awesome."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place for Asian Fusion, this spot replaced the old Hazelrock Cafe and makes a good use of the space.  Was craving a hearty bowl of Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup and decided to try their Salt & Pepper Fried Chicken Cartilage. The items here are definitely family-style and sharable as the portions are quite large.   The Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup came with thick egg noodles, beef soup containing really tender, fatty beef pieces, chopped pickled mustard greens and topped with cilantro. The soup was good, but didn't have that much depth and definitely needed a bit more spices, but adding some white pepper helped some. Whenever I think of this type of noodle dish I think of the herbal and almost medicinal flavor that deepens the beef soup which makes it so unique.  The Fried Chicken Cartilage was just okay, kind of bland and fried similar to that of katsu. Even with the pieces of garlic and green onions, it didn't have much of an aroma to it.  Finished off the shared meal with a Large Taro Shaved Ice, topped with grass jelly, strawberries and condensed milk. The shaved ice didn't have a smooth or melty texture when eaten, but definitely has chunks of Taro and a gritty texture. The grass jelly was good and the strawberries were ripe. Portion was a bit small for price point, $6.99, including the two toppings.  Atmosphere is definitely nice and not shabby like most \"Chinese\" restaurants and feel that this is more on the authentic side of Chinese, American Chinese and Taiwanese versus any small \"Chinese\" restaurant you can find elsewhere. The service was quick and attentive. Definitely a place with trial and error, hoping to come back to try their HK style food for lunch and definitely will pass on the stuff I had."}
{"text":"11/03/2016  Yelp review Asian Fusion Cafe 725 S Rural Rd Ste 103 Tempe, AZ 85281 (480) 939-2555  When I first passed by the restaurant, I found out that this is a Hong Kong style restaurant, and I am really excited and want to try it. The foods in this restaurant serve many kinds and area of Asian food. It mainly serve the southern area food in China, but also have several foods that from other areas. As a Taiwanese, I think the foods are really suited for my taste. You can always eat from light taste to spicy taste. And all of them are good. I always choose the light taste food, but sometimes if I want to try some spicy food I can just ordered it and it is also good. I always remember the first time I had eaten the Hainanese Chicken rice, which is really good, especially it serves the whole chicken for each meal and they always give three special sauces, which tasted really good. There are also another dishes called Sea Food Pain rice noodle, which is one of my favorite. I sometimes would like to order several dishes with rice. I can always eat them with my friends or family together, like we always like to order the Szechwan Chili boiled with fish and bee, which is really tasty to eat with white rice, also the Yu Xiang Pork is really great. After finish the dishes I always order some desert also. There are many kinds of desert and I'm really surprised that these deserts are in United States.  I thought I can only eat these Asian desert in my hometown. The Black Sesame Soup and the Thai Blake Glutinous Rice in Vanilla Sauce is what I really recommended. Especially, the Thai Blake Glutinous Rice, which is really an Asian desert and the special thing, is that the restaurant adds the corn in it. This combination and unique ways I have never eaten before. They also serve some special drinks like Hong Kong Style milk tea, which is not too sweet, but still has its own unique flavor. There are so many kind of food to introduce, I really recommend not only the Asians also the local people can give a try; it contains so many different sort of Asian food style from sweet to spicy.  The atmosphere is also a big feature in this restaurant. I really like it, because it's light and the decoration is really classical. I think they spent many time for it in order to give a nice atmosphere to the customers. I would like to visit it is also because the place is really comfortable to chat and eat with people. The servers are all nice and really kind. They can speak mandarin, English and even the Cantonese fluently, when I asked some questions of the dishes they describe the foods details to me. The price is really suited and they always give a big quantity of every meal. I am really satisfied with it. The price is around $7-$9. I can always eat full and satisfied the meal with this price, which is also an appeal for me. I have been here for two to three years; this is the Asian restaurant I really impressed so far."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I was more than impressed with their awesome foods, really satisfying service and clean place. I was more than happy that there are more and more fantastic Asian restaurant here in AZ. We will definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"Stopped by for Hong Kong style cafe food!! This place is honestly crazy good!! I was very shocked to be honest!! Started with their Hong Kong milk tea which was above average. Started with creamy corn soup which was pretty genuine...the fried pork chop with red sauce on spaghetti was so freaking authentic!! Loved it!!! Also had Malaysian curry haw fun which had good flavor!! Beef haw fun was good and the hainan chicken was pretty smooth!! Desert of red bean ice drink was really good as well!! For me, loving small Hong Kong cafe style food, was five stars!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from a friend in culinary school. I don't usually eat Asian style foods but the fusion Hong Kong/Schezuan style was really interesting. I highly recommend the Yang chow fried rice and ANYTHING curry (curry fishballs were the best). Great Asian cuisine close to campus, can't get better then that!!"}
{"text":"I have been there many times and I like their french toast the best."}
{"text":"The place is cozy. The service is fine. However, the food did not meet our expectation. We ordered the beef noodle soup, crispy tofu, and salt-n-pepper pork chop. The noodle soup was too salty. The crispy tofu on the other hand did not have any flavor and was not crispy at all. The pork chop was ok, but it could be better if they have some other side dishes."}
{"text":"This is a hidden corner of the plaza.  It has a nice fusion of American/Hong Kong atmosphere with a mural on the wall, desserts near the door and Chinese music playing in the background.  Prices were reasonable and the dish I order was very generous in portion.  I was interested in the wonton soup but opted for their salted fish with chicken and tofu.  It came in a pie type dish which held all the wonderful sauce   which I used the rice to soak up.  The right amount of salt vs chicken vs tofu combination.    Their HK milk tea was just right for a hot day.  I ran out of room for anything else, so no dessert but is definitely on my list to come back."}
{"text":"So I decided to come back to try other dishes with my friends yesterday.  I was surprised that some of the dishes my friends ordered that I retried was different than I had it the first time.  And thus, an update is in order.  1.  Fried won ton - I had the won ton noodle won ton and thought the flavor wasn't strong enough but the fried won ton was AWESOME!  It came with curry sauce which in my previous review, I already mentioned how much I love their curry sauce.  2.  Egg plant with garlic sauce or something - It's fine, I wasn't that interested in egg plant, but the flavor was good.    3.  Beef noodle soup -  If you look at my previous review, you will notice I'm a picky beef noodle soup diner, I even went to Taiwan to try the various famous noodle soup.  This place is no joke.  Better than many places in SF bay area. I really love the noodle.  I particularly like the texture of the noodle because it's al dente and not soft.  The soup flavor is strong and I love that.  Must try!  4.  Pork chop bun - now, this is serious.  My favorite pork chop bun is in Macau, from the famous On Kee in western district.  It's one of the must try, world famous dishes in Macau.  This one is VERY good.  The meat was flavorful (Again, I had just the pork chop and thought the flavor is too light but this one totally perfect), the cutlet was crunchy and the fries... it's got a coating but it's not season, but very crunchy.  MUST try!!!  5.  Rice roll? - I don't even know what they call this in English.  This rice roll is exactly the one I had in HK street vendor when I was a child!  I haven't seen people able to make this kind of rice roll in America.  The one at the dim sum is a joke, I mean they are not bad but it's different than this one.  The sauce is very authentic... totally remind me of my childhood.    6.  Beef roll - The wrapping is too thick for my preference but the meat and the sauce is quite good.  7.  Red bean ice (with ice cream) - I'm not a big fan in the bay area for this particular drink because no one does it that well only 1 in Sunset district of SF, a Vietnamese restaurant.  I loved those red bean ice.  Asian Fusion Cafe was able to do it exactly as good... its so delicious.  Anyone like red bean ice drink will agree with me.  Secret... coconut milk.  It's such a treat.  8.  fish ball - another HK street vendor special.  The fish ball is of very good quality, texture is great and it's the fried type of fish ball.  Just like those in HK.  Love it!  So after the 2nd time trying this restaurant, I had to say it's one of the best Chinese food restaurant in Phoenix area.  Asian or Chinese food lovers are here for a treat.  Impressive."}
{"text":"I've come here several times. It's  nice to have a hong kong cafe that isn't  a hole-in-the wall. The decor remains from Hazelrock Cafe. The tables are pretty annoying your knees will bump into them constantly because  tables aren't wide enough. The servers are overall friendly and the restaurant is spacious and clean.  The Food: I tried the Baked Portuguese Curry over rice it was missing the spice and had an overload of cheese. My husband ordered the pork chop with  red sauce and spaghetti and it was delicious. We had to fight over the food.   We tried the popcorn chicken & wasn't  anything special it needed a sauce. DON'T order the wonton soup tastes very BLAND yet has a lot of salt.   The highlights are the  fried noodles like Beef Chow Fun & the drinks Hong Kong  Milktea and Red Bean ice drink.  Overall, I would come here more for dessert I wish they had tea time specials like other Hong Kong cafe's. The food is hit or miss usually depending in what you order.  Overall: 4 for decor 3 for food 4 for service"}
{"text":"I love this place! so authentic the servers are so nice and caring. My time here was enjoyable. I mean there was a bit of a language barrier but I still will come back here. My favorite dish has to be the kung pao chicken! It's too die for! The service is amazing and so is the food! I highly recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a good time good food and good vibes"}
{"text":"Their fried food has a strong over cooked oily smell, seems like they don't change their deep frying oil often enough.    Their meat has an odd texture, they may add something to tender the meat."}
{"text":"Was pretty excited to try this place after reading some good reviews and have to say, extremely disappointed. The decor is cute and trendy but the food was average at best. For the first time in my life I had to send food back to the kitchen because the potstickers were still frozen on the inside. We were told the Orange Chicken is popular and needed another dish for the group and it tasted like gas station food. Some of the food came out hot, some lukewarm, and some frozen. Even the more authentic dishes - which I've eaten numerous times across the country - just don't taste right.   Also had three different servers during the course of the meal, all of which sat down together at a table right by my group during our meal for a meal of their own. I never have an issue with staff needing to eat but after issues with the food, it just capped off the experience to not have any service.   If you have to absolutely eat here, get the Chinese broccoli worung"}
{"text":"Fairly authentic fare. ???? was pretty good! Milk tea wasn't bad, portion was a little small though."}
{"text":"So, you want to know what a Hong Kong Canteen is like? This is my recommendation - go here for a small lunch, enjoy the decor and ambiance and get a general feel for everything. Then for dinner, go Asian Cafe Express, don't mind the crappy decor and mismatched furniture and enjoy yourself wholeheartedly because it's definitely the clear winner in this round.   Came here the other day with family and it was definitely nice to see something like this pop up. This place used to just sell drinks and pastries, but they seem to have expanded with an actual food menu. Regardless of reviews, this place is definitely here to stay to service my fellow FOBs at ASU who will most certainly flock here like it's the new holy grail.   Drinks were either too sweet or not sweet enough, but there's a vat of sugar at your table to try to remedy it. Drinks are served in pretty tall glasses so you could save some $$ and share with someone. We ordered 10 dishes total to share - a mix of hit and misses. I highly recommend everyone order the fried chicken appetizer. It's super crunchy and the size of the their chicken is ridiculous. Like where-the-hell-did-they-find-this-giant-chicken ridiculous. We ordered a variety of noodles including chow mein, udon, and lo mein. No worries as they definitely have their noodles down pat. As for the misses it was mostly anything that included meat. Their baked pork chop had an off flavor and texture (mostly the rice) and their beef was dry and hard. Probably the worst thing about this place? The service. It is dreadful. The servers seem like they're literally afraid to approach you so if you want your water refilled, have any questions about your food, or want to order more - good luck. You're better off at the DMV.   I'm going to give it another try and come back here for lunch. The sandwiches are always the main stars of a Hong Kong canteen and I have a hunch that this place is more satisfying as a lunch establishment than dinner. A warning to all, parking at night is a straight up nightmare as they share it with BWW and Ihop so be prepared to do some parking lot stalking.   Essentially, if you're not too picky about your environment decor and would like bigger portions for less $$ that are tastier and more authentic, go to Asian Cafe Express instead. You'll find more menu options, speedy gonzalez service, and food that'll remind you of the asian mother you never had."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant in AZ. This is the second time because we decided to give it another chance. The first time we came here was disappointed, I ordered the beef noodle soup, beef looked like shit and the noodle looked like bird nest, they were not cooked!!! The Hainan chicken my husband ordered was disgusting too.  This time, We order chicken curry and beef stew lo mein(Asian noodle). OMG the curry is dry no flavor and the beef stew has no flavor and just plain noodle with beef on top. My husband had to add soy sauce, salt, pepper, and chili oil just to get some flavor and manage to eat a little. Just to emphasize one thing we are Cantonese and we usually don't add salt to the food but this time we had too. Very disappointing. This one star is for the milk tea, which is the only thing we like in this restaurant. ?????????????????????"}
{"text":"Have not seen a authentic chinese cafe in arizona until this one opened! When walking in it gives you the feel if a chinese restaraunt but with a more modern look. The menu offers a variety of drinks/desserts along with a wide variety of dishes.  I personally recommend the curry fishball and fried chicken wings for appetizer. The salt and pepper pork chop and yang chow fried rice for entree. To top it off i had a hong kong style tea for beverage and for desert i got the mango pomelo!   Will be returning to try all the other dishes!"}
{"text":"I was incredibly excited to try the food here  after seeing the photos and reading reviews about the authentic Hong Kong Cuisine. I'm allowing three stars because I did order at 9:30 and they close at 10 so perhaps that accounts for the disappointment when I picked up my to go order. I do have to say that the service was friendly and accommodating despite my late take out, which was really nice. When I picked up my to go order, the smells were amazing and I was excited to bring the food home to my boyfriend who was nursing a sore throat. I ordered the taiwanese beef noodle soup for him, a shrimp fried rice to share, and ma po tofu for me. The first thing I noticed when I opened the bag and took out the container for the soup was the oil residue that was left on my hands, not deterred in the least, I continued to fix a bowl for my boyfriend. At this point, I discovered that the oil was not only on the outside of the container but making up the majority of the soup. I used chicken broth I had on hand to try and mellow out the oil, which I thought was chili oil but really did not have much flavor to it. While trying to salvage the soup, I proceeded to take a few bites of my tofu dish. At this point I realized the oil was also an issue in the tofu, I attached a picture of the oil layer on the tofu (soup was worse), but because I was hungry I ate some bites. Before I finished preparing a bowl of soup, I felt sick. By this time the cafe was closed. I was upset only because I was so excited to try this place! I didn't eat anymore, maybe 1/4 of the rice, none of the soup (even with the chicken stock), and about 1/4 of the tofu. I did get a Hong Kong milk tea and coffee, it was average, but the only thing I finished! I called back the next day during their lunch hour and I now have a $10 credit to come back (even though I spent $37 originally)... At any rate, at least I can come back and try another drink or two for free!   I would recommend to dine in and proceed with caution."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Whether you go for dinner or to  sip on a coffee this is the place to go.   I highly recommend their chow fun noodles. This is the only place that I know what has them...it's like a fat noodle. Another dish is the walnut shrimp. It is crispy and drenched in sauce!"}
{"text":"Quite diasppointed with the food. It all looked delicious but once I took a bite, I felt everything was lacking in flavor. The best dish was the chicken cartilage and surprisingly the passionfruit iced green tea.   We had the flavorless hainan chicken, needs salt portuguese chicken and spaghetti, curryless fried curry wontons, and the soggy  spareribs and rice rolls."}
