{"text":"Waitstaff treated us like we were stealing because we put more then one plate on our tray at the salad bar. But the sign has an all you can eat price so that's what we were going. Went out of her way to tell uswe could not take some home, duh. Rude, slow service. The lettuce was rancid and when I asked for an item to be refilled on the salad bar because it was empty the worker said \"ok but it will be a while\" in a snotty voice and moved at snail speed. I will not be back. Don't make your customers feel like they did something wrong just for being customers. Left feeling terrible."}
{"text":"A little confusing for a newbie here. Was I supposed to bring in items from the buffet in to-go items or ask for a plate? Pay in the grocery store area or somehow get a bill at the table? Anyhoo, we figured it out while simultaneously playing trivia. Any place that hosts trivia is an automatic A-OK to me. Not huge competition at this place, perhaps 7-10 teams? One of the teams had literally 20 people, though they didn't place. How it actually worked was that one of our diners got a ceramic plate of 1 item Chinese Buffet for $7.99 and I got a ceramic plate of 1 piece fried chicken with two sides for $7.99. The buffet servers knew to give us pink slips to bring into the restaurant. We ditched the plastic-ware and plastic trays, instead using read silverware and the tables. Waitstaff was extremely friendly, checking on us a number of times. Happy hour draught beer is $2; the bar area was pretty nice. I would sit there next time if not playing trivia."}
{"text":"A sloppy and ridiculous review by one person giving it 3 stars, yet every was really good?  It deserves 4-5 stars, not the 3 that it received. Buoy get fantastic food and a good atmosphere.  It's a solid 4 star experience, but I'm giving it 5 because I think everyone should try it out for themselves."}

Hy-Vee Market Grille is located in, but separate from, the East Side Hy-Vee Grocery Store

Unlike your old school Hy-Vee cafes, which honestly are usually .... straight out of the 60's?, the Market \"Grille\" is comfortably nice, with tons of TV's, a real bar, and decent, if somewhat generic food.

You can eat from the buffet, or order off the menu.  And, you can get a beer, glass of wine, or a mixed drink, all at stupid low prices.  I mean, $2 draft beer in a place with a bunch of flat screen tv\"s?  Wine specials?  Craft Beer specials?   It may not have the cachet of all the in places in Madison, and is hopelessly redneck for most Madisonians, but its comfortable and cheap.

The food is...ok.  Ordering off the menu will get a well prepared meal cheap, and the buffet is...better than some.  It's not awesome, but it is ok.  Plenty of fresh fruit, ok deserts, decent buffet.

And beverages (well, not the booze) comes with the price of the meal!  $4.99 for eggs, toast and hashbrowns, and got 2 large glasses of OJ - score.  Some places would charge you $5 for the juice.

Having eaten in a number of older Hy-Vee cafes, I was not expecting much, and I got more."}
{"text":"You HAVE to try it! 
Sounds strange to dine at a grocery store but the food is outstanding! They have a full bar, a fantastic happy hour & excellent service! Soo worth a try -"}
{"text":"My family and I went here for the Easter buffet.The food was absolutely delicious. They had everything from a taco bar to prime rib to a chocolate fountain. My only problem with my experience was the waitstaff they seemed like they were still in training it took 15 minutes for them to order our drinks"}
{"text":"The Market Grille (or Market Cafe as it is displayed on the doors) is always a convenient option for us.  The nights where you are not sure what to make at home usually end up in wandering the aisles of Hy-Vee, and a few times we have ended up sitting in the Grille's booths.  

The food is nothing spectacular.  Typically there are offerings available from the \"to-go\" counters in the store in addition to the brief menu.  There is always the \"burger of the month\" option which has always been a larger than fair portion which doesn't fail to please.  We were fortunate enough to be there while the \"Grand Buffet\" was available.  Everything on the floor (pizza, Chinese, deli counter, etc.) was available for $11.99.  Not a bad deal when it includes a beverage.  The little one was allowed to graze off of our plates without paying for his own.

All-in-all, the Grille reminds me of a truck stop.  The staff is partial to regulars, and even at that the service is slow.  Almost seems like the \"management\" is treating the operation like a 5-star joint while the service realizes they are working in a grocery store.  If it weren't for the \"Grand Buffet,\" I would have given a 2."}
