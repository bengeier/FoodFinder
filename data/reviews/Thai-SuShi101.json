{"text":"This place is great. The food was very good and the service was excellent. I had sushi and my little one had the chicken satay off the kids' menu. The miso soup was good, too. They have a full Thai menu, and then a similar sushi menu to the Sushi 101's on Park Rd. and in Ballantyne. The decor is very nice, also. Go check it out."}
{"text":"Our first visit here.  Marisa the server,  I hope that was her name was very nice. and helped us with the menu.  We had the Tom Kha gai chicken coconut soup had amazing flavors.  And we also had the pad woon sen cellophane noodle just perfectly spiced.  . So far my new favorite thai place hoping to try the sushi next time."}
{"text":"very nice inside.  you can tell they put some money into this place.  thai food was good and very authentic but  portions were small for the price.  even got charged extra rice.   i hate when asian places do that considering rice is so cheap.  

don't recommend ordering to go.   the portion was ridiculously small.   note sure if i'd go back."}
{"text":"I love the sushi but have not try Thai. Service was good, friendly staff. I will give it another try."}
{"text":"The sushi was average at best. We also tried several other menu items and were disappointed. The service was extremely SLOW.  There were only two tables occupied including ours.  I do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Huntersville area! My favorite menu items are the pad thai and fried rice! I also recommend their sushi!"}
{"text":"Service was just okay. Their food has always been great, especially their Pad Thai. I just wish they were slightly cheaper. There are less expensive and just as satisfying options in the same shopping center."}
{"text":"All the sushi I've had here has all been delicious! Especially the dynamite roll and the lava roll. I've also heard positive reviews about the Pad Thai. Though maybe save for a time you're not starving - I've been twice and both times our orders took a long time to come out, even though the place was empty."}
{"text":"Excellent!  For years my favorite sushi place in Charlotte has been sushi 101 on park rd.  I was so excited when they opened a restaurant closer to my home.  The staff and chefs were extremely friendly and accommodating.  Being pregnant, I cannot have any undercooked meat or fish.  The chef made everything for me to order including cooking my sushi so I could eat what I have been craving.  He even made the sauce from scratch for me in order to omit the raw fish eggs.  The food was fabulous and atmosphere was very pleasant as well.  I hope this place stays in business for many years to come.  I know I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place! The service is always excellent and the food is amazing. I recommend the pad thai or any of the curries."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! The food is really good I got the duck wings, the spicy tuna with avocado roll, and I got the spring rolls. Everything was cooked to perfection especially the duck wings! Will return again the Decour in the restaurant is chic. A great date night restaurant. The place is clean and the sake flights are amazing. Get the lychee sake."}
{"text":"Went with my husband and two kids. I ordered the Pad Thai. I tasted it and it just tasted off. My husband agreed. I pushed it to the side to send back to the waitress when she came back. I overheard the table behind us returning their Pad Thai as well. Not a taste treat. My kids had California rolls and liked them. My husband had Malaysian curry which wasn't on the menu and it was pretty good. We were there around 6:30 on a Friday night and there were only a couple of tables filled. The Thai iced tea was yummy! Unfortunately we won't be back."}
{"text":"Definitely worth an eat. Great ambiance, amazing food probably the best Thai in town, and a great dining experience. Wait staff was courteous and always ready to help. Ordered Pad Thai and Green Curry, out of this world!"}
{"text":"Worst sushi I've ever had. And the sushi took literally 1 hour to get to our table, none of the rolls were even cooked rolls. Not cheap either. Do yourself a favor and go to Coral for good sushi! So disappointing and gross"}
{"text":"I am not a sushi person, but the Thai offerings were outstanding! Our former favorite Thai restaurant recently closed, and this was an excellent replacement, even down to having our favorite dishes!  This is a delicious must try for any Thai food fan in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"I love all their thai curries and have turned into a sake (salmon nigiri sushi) fan! Must visit if you are around this area"}
{"text":"Best and and freshest sushi I have ever had in my life. The Nigiri prices are unbeatable and the staff is very friendly. The sushi chef have magic hands behind the counter. Definitely must come back soon."}
{"text":"A little inconsistent, sometimes u can order the same thing and get 2 different variations of the same dish.  Ordered a noodle dish the first time I ate here and it was so flavorful and delicious...got it again a few weeks later and it was extremely bland and unremarkable."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I cannot see this place staying open that long without changing substantially. In a nutshell overly priced, low volume & bland tasting for what we ate. The photo is that of the \"Spicy Eggplant\" ... $13.95 for an unbelievably small portion, zero spice factor & very low on the eggplant. Go over to Noodletasia for a much better Eggplant dish for much more value. Maki were small and so poor you could find better in the Harris Teeter nearby. Overall a really bad choice & will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and had great food. The basil roll was great. It's nice to have great service even though they were very busy. Looking forward to eating there again when I am the area."}
{"text":"I was with some friends and we were in the mood for some Thai. We yelped some Thai places and this place came up. A hidden gem, truly, in the midst of a poppin' shopping center. We got Pad Thai because we were craving and that Pad-Thai is the true definition of beauty is from the inside because when we opened that to-go box, the Pad Thai was so pale we were set on the fact that it can't be good. There was no color! We were wrong. The flavor on those noodles were so good, that was all that mattered. We also got Basil Duck and the seasoning was on point. I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu items!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to give you 1 Star. We ordered the spring rolls because they claim to be vegetarian but didn't realize they were fried. When we got them home we realize the menu description doesn't say they are fried. We have had other \"spring rolls\" that have the thin rice paper and are fresh not fried.

My wife called and asked for a substitution on the Basil rolls minus the shrimp. The manger said this would be fine to replace with tofu or veggies.

When we got the second batch home and about to bite into I noticed the red shrimp skins showing through. They made them with shrimp even though we specifically asked for no fish.

I went back for the third time and got a refund, thank you. But for vegetarians be advised they are not as aware as some Thai restaurants are."}
{"text":"Yikes.  Stay away!  Only had one waiter for 10-15 tables. And he approached by saying \"I'm so sorry, we are slammed.\" 
I totally get it... But not a good start.  He next took our drink orders, and I ordered a Coke, wife ordered an ice tea. We both got waters.... Oh well, less tip for him since the order will be less.  I next ordered the Thai peanut with chicken either BROWN rice. Well, I got white rice. 
The food is pretty good.... If you get the right order.  Safe to say we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner. Overall pretty good. Friendly staff. Appetizers were okay and the wait time was a little long considering it wasn't very busy, but the main dishes were delicious and very large. Would definitely go here again for some Thai. Didn't try the sushi."}
{"text":"Me and my friend were in the mood for sushi, and wanted to try a new place. So I looked on yelp and saw Thai-Sushi 101. It seemed like the experience was a hit or miss, so decided to try it out and see anyways. When we walked in, the place was dead. Only one table was occupied. The steamed dumplings were good, nothing spectacular though. The server was patient with us ordering because were indecisive for a bit. I ordered the mumbo jumbo roll that says tempura flakes on top. My friend ordered a cucumber roll and asked for cream cheese in it and also the shrimp tempura roll. When we received our sushi, I noticed my roll was crispy and the menu did not say it would be, only tempura flakes. My friends cucumber roll did not have the cream cheese in it and was very dry. I asked the server if my sushi was supposed to be crispy because the menu said tempura flakes and she said yes it's a crispy roll. So I ate it anyways. It was good. I decided to check the menu again to see if I just looked at it wrong, and I didn't. It said tempura flakes and nothing about the entire roll being crispy, so that frustrated me because the server lied to me. If she checked the menu and realized it was done wrong, and offered to fix it then of course there would be no issue, but I didn't like that she lied. So I told the server that I just checked the menu and nothing says crispy about it and also you forgot my friends cream cheese in her roll, so she brought the manager over and I told her the situation. The manager even said \" the mumbo jumbo is a crispy roll, it says it on the menu.\" That's funny, because I just checked and it didn't say it at all. So 2 people lied to me and that made me more upset. So the manager goes and looks at the menu probably to prove to me that it says \"crispy\" and realized it doesn't say it and decided to go to the cook and yell at him/her. You can hear everything that goes on in this restaurant, nothing is professional nor discrete. So she decides to tell me that there are \" new menus\" and initially the roll was crispy but now it's changed and she didn't realized there was new menus? I don't remember an apology either, but she did take off my roll and the cucumber roll from our bill, which is nice, but I just couldn't get past the fact that both of them lied to me. Check your own menu before confirming something. I probably will never come back here, but I do hope someone has a better experience than we did."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in the area. Actually, it's my favorite local restaurant period. My wife and I have never had a bad meal here and the staff are always fantastic. Our favorites are the Pad Thai and the curries. We've also had several good sushi rolls, although my favorite is always the Pad Thai- hot, sweet, and bursting with flavor. There is never a wait, either. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness. We got pad thai and a beef rice dish. Both were packed with flavor. We'll be coming back."}
{"text":"This is easily the best Thai restaurant in Charlotte at least for authentic chicken pad Thai. They offer a military discount too which is amazing. Everyone from the hostess to the waitresses and the chef is very sweet and kind. Oh and the portions are amazing. 

This comes highly recommended and definitely a must visit!"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite Thai restaurant. I had the pad Thai and the basil rolls. It was soooooo good. The noodles were thin and it was so tasty. The service was great! We ordered it take out and they wrote on the containers to have a great week with little hearts so sweet. I'm definitely gonna be going here a lot now."}
{"text":"Awesome little find, but you have to search for it, it is hidden a bit.    Awesome lunch and great service.   

Great dishes, love the sweet and sour and Mongolian  dishes.  Sushi is fabulous and chef is wonderful.   Great presentations for all meals. 

Tuesday used to have 20% off all items for lunch...that was great, not sure if for dinners."}
{"text":"We went here last weekend with a Groupon . As you all know that can go really good or really bad. This one went really good. It started Rocky, our steamed dumplings were cold and waterlogged. I wish my boyfriend wouldn't have eaten them, but he was starving.  I was honest with the waitress when she came to check in on us, but there was only one left. So I really didn't have a leg to stand on when complaining. I got the Thai salad which was just freaking delicious. The boyfriend got the pad Thai and he also said it was really good. For dessert we got the fried ice cream which was really really good. All in all this could've gone very wrong, but ended up being a good night.  The waitress was also really really nice, and  that helps me look past the soggy dumplings.  Everyone has an off day once a while. I will definitely check this place out if I'm ever in Huntersville and want some good Thai salad."}
{"text":"The food is decent, interesting menu. But the service is absolutely unacceptable. What should have taken 45 minutes at the most to eat lunch from start to finish took an hour and a half. Only go if he planned to spend some time during your lunch hour."}
{"text":"Came late on weekday night, had to wait a minute for the waitress to notice us. Anyways, my boyfriend ordered Thai and he loved it and I also tried some of it, real hot, just how it is supposed to be made. I ordered a California roll and a Rainbow roll just to see what their sushi was like. Some of the best looking tuna I've seen a while, not to mention so delicious we didn't take any food home! Will visit again if I'm in the Rosedale area."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Best pad Thai north of Charlotte, for sure! Their basil rolls and squid salad are delicious, too! Try the tiger rolls, if you like cream cheese!  The staff is always friendly, and the restaurant is clean & quiet."}
{"text":"Lettuce wraps tasted like fish. I took one bite and sent it back. The waitress was rude and they were going to make me pay for it. I refused and was told not to sass her that she was just a waitress. Is this place for real? All dishes apparently come with fish sauce or oyster sauce, you'd think they would tell you that or put it in the menu, especially since there are a lot of people with food allergies."}
{"text":"We have been to every restaurant that has been in this location over the years. This place is by far the best restaurant to take over this location. The sushi was insanely fresh, excellent! The Nigiri ala carte options and prices are good. They are still working on the service end of things as a new restaurant, however the service was not bad by any means. They definitely aim to please. Their curry is quite good. I typically am not a fan of curry but they managed to impress me. The soup I got had excellent broth and nice sized shrimp. We are for sure coming back."}
{"text":"Mumbo Jumbo roll is awesome!! The Pad Thai here reminds me of the what I used to have in Chicago. I love the Thai, Sushi and Indian mix of food."}
{"text":"great food great service...Ilove sushi.. charlotte roll and the mambo jumbo roll. I even tried the Thai wow that is amazing all the curry stuff yum!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good, it has more of an American twist to the Thai food. The service was ok, could be better since there was literally 3 tables being occupied."}
{"text":"Went here with family. The place is dirty and looks run down. The food was so bland. They didn't have any regular soy sauce. The prices are high. The whole experience was laughable. I should have mentioned I used the Groupon... The reviews on it are false as well. I would have rather just lost the $15 I paid for the Groupon than had this experience. 

 On the food ordered. 
Chicken Pineapple Fried rice... bland and funky flavor. 
Lettuce raps- Served cold? Never had lettuce raps served cold. Also had pineapple in them. It was drenched with stickiness and a twang that wasn't enjoyable. 
Chicken Satay- Over cooked. Complete dry. The peanut sauce sucked. It was so blah.. lacking flavor and just nit enjoyable. Not like any peanut sauce I've had. Nor will have again. 
Do yourself a favor and skip this..."}
{"text":"Very good food! Unfortunate circumstances at the hospital lead to a great food find! Three flavor shrimp was excellent!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. I wouldn't refuse to go again but I definitely wouldn't suggest it as the #1 place. 

Meal: 
Wonton soup 4/5
Calamari 3/5 batter has a tad odd and it was more rubbery than usual 
Sushi 2/5 some had a weird taste and others were bland. 

Service 5/5
Decor 5/5

Overall it wasn't the best food but it also wasn't the worst."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi in Huntersville. A little hidden behind the 7Eleven at Exit 23 on I-77. 
Mr. Ken is a great sushi chef. And Hailey will provide excellent customer service and make sure your order is prepared the way you like it. 
The coconut soup is delicious. Especially as it gets colder.  
The sushi is fresh. Whether you like it prepared nigiri or sashimi style. 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm struggling to give this a 2 star rating because the waitress was very nice, what food we actually got was really good & the sweet tea was awesome. 
However, we went for the 1st time on aMonday & apparently they hadn't gotten their truck yet which meant they were out of 3 appetizers so we settled for spring rolls. Which were good... Then the longest wait on sushi for the place to only have 3 people total including myself. My husbands order was correct but mine wasn't. So I told the lady & even heard her tell the cooks my order correctly again, just for it to take another 10 minutes to get the same exact order that was wrong to start with... by that time we were ready to leave... so she took off my order & gave a 10% discount."}
{"text":"I'm a long time customer that has come to appreciate the value of 101. Get to know Jay and Mel, you won't be disappointed. If you're trusting.....let Jay know what you're favorites are and ask him to be creative. I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"For some reason I delayed coming here, but we were impressed when we finally did!  The food and service was good and the interior was pretty nice. It wasn't very busy when we went so I wanted to write a review in case anyone else was thinking of going but unsure."}
{"text":"I ordered take out the other day and I actually enjoyed it. The portion size was good and food was fresh. I had the basil chicken and it was full of flavor. My favorite thing was when I told them to make it spicy...they actually did! I love spicy food! Some restaurants try to Westernize food too much and are scared of spice. The beef larb was good but not the best I've had. I would definitely order again though. The only con was that it is a little more pricey than most Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"Delicious food, very nice decor, and cool music. Sushi was yummy and all the Thai dishes I tried have been awesome."}
{"text":"Terrible service and even worse food. Probably the worst red curry shrimp that I've ever had. If you're in the mood to be treated poorly and receive awful food, this is your place. There is a reason this place is always empty."}
{"text":"Excellent!! Took advantage of a Groupon and came on a Monday evening with my husband and teens. Arrived around 5 pm and the place was empty. Guess not surprising for a Monday evening. We were seated at a very large and comfortable booth and promptly greeted by our server, Melissa. Immediately I noticed that the music was very loud but they were playing my favorite songs from the 70s and 80s so I let it go. Melissa was very friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. She was able to answer all of our questions with ease. She also gave recommendations. She took our orders without writing anything down and got everything right. Let me tell you first off: get the Mumbo Jumbo Roll! Trust me. You will thank me later. Oh my God it was so good! My husband and one of my teens ordered the shrimp tempura and fried vegetables. I didn't have any but they really enjoyed their meals. I also had the wonton soup. My goodness! The presentation! It came out in a flaming bowl with a live fire in the middle of it. The food - excellent. Service - excellent. Atmosphere - excellent. We will be back!

Mumbo Jumbo Roll!!"}
{"text":"One thing about this place that make me to come here every week is sushi. I'm a sushi lover so I know very well how sushi taste like, especially with the fresh quality of raw fish. It is indeed an irresistible place for great food. Sushi in this restaurant is very fresh, outstanding quality and best sushi chef I've ever seen. Thai food in the other hand is great as well, very nice taste of Thai culture. My favorite are Green curry and Pad Thai. Friendly people in the restaurant, everything is great. Thai-Sushi 101 is the place that I stop by 1-3 times every week. Definitely a good place to come, I would recommend everyone to stop by and try out their food, it is a great place to come and have lunch as well as dinner."}
{"text":"Love it here!!!!! The staff is so friendly and remembers me every time, after only a couple visits! Delish."}
{"text":"Very good poke and sushi - outside of the box approach on the poke. Kind staff, super clean. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Haven't tried the food yet, ordered takeout.   Giving 1 star because they charge $1.25 to order online and then try to justify it by the small print.   Thought I was doing them a favor by not tying up their phone line.

Changed to 3 stars, very average to below average sushi to me, the beef larb was actually pretty good though.   Mind is still blown they charge customers to order food online.   

I won't go back."}
{"text":"Yikes!!! Every one beware! Especially if you eat sushi there! Found their health report"}
{"text":"I love Thai-Sushi 101! I am so glad to have something like this in the Lake Norman area. We eat a lot of Thai food and a lot of Sushi. I have never had either as fresh as it was here. The service and knowledge there are great! Especially on recommendations. Also try the Soups!!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. The sushi is excellent and the people are extremely friendly. The sushi chef, Mr. Ken is one of the best I've encountered - including my trips to Asia.


Try the Elizabeth roll and the Tom Kha Gai (coconut soup). Both are awesome.

For excellent service ask for Hailey!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Try to have lunch there today. Everybody just kind of stared at me. Walked out as everybody was staring at me. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Very nice sushi and menu items. Good miso soup but small portion. All items are very fresh. Good basil rolls with shrimp. Salmon roll very tasty. The big impression here is fresh. Nothing tastes frozen or prepackaged.I will be back"}
{"text":"For the past 2 or 3 months I've consistently  been getting this soup from Thai Sushi 101 that I can never seem to find on their menu, but it's in a tom yum broth, it has tons of shrimp and some veggies and rice noodles in it...it's the best soup I've ever had. It's a shame that I won't be getting it again. 

The customer service here has always been spotty imo...there are times when they've been accommodating, and even given me a discount b/c they misquoted me on the price of this mysterious soup that I can't find on their menu...but this evening wasn't so pleasant. 

When my fiancé went to pick up the food we ordered he realized he forgot his wallet. I called and asked if I could pay over the phone and the girl I was speaking to said she'd have to get her manager. Manager explicitly asked if it was a Visa, MC, Discover...After reading my card number to the manager, she proceeded to read my card number back to me...out loud...in what sounded like a crowded place. When I asked her if she could stop before she got to the last 4 digits she seemed annoyed and huffed \"well I have to verify the number, I can't just put some random number in here.\" When I offered to repeat it she huffed again and said that it didn't matter. She then asked for the expiration date and then huffed AGAIN \"your done\" and handed the phone back to the girl who was helping me the first time, saying \"now tell her thank you and bye.\" 

It was odd. As someone who works in an industry where I encounter victims of identity theft often, i just couldn't let her finish reading my card number out loud...not sure why she was the one who was so bothered by the situation...I'm the one who would've ended up with a bunch of random charges on my account. 

Now I gotta find a new spot"}
{"text":"Have to update my review. I think the staff has turned over since last I visited. My wife and I called in to get take out, the young lady asked if we REALLY wanted it because they were busy. My wife said \"yes\".... the response was it would be ready in 30 min.... followed by, do you really want it.... our response \"yes\"..... young lady responded, ok, it'll be an hour.       Needless to say, we didn't order.  Giving 2 stars for the customer service. Can't rate the food, even though we did really want it."}
{"text":"Drive through this town a lot and stay at a hotel near here. Happening to look up this place...LOVE the food and serve was great. We came during lunch and had the Santan chicken, spicy and amaziness.. definitely coming back here.. oh the sweet tea yums"}
{"text":"I purchased an Groupon for Thai Sushi 101 where I spent $15 for $25.  This was my second time at Thai Sushi 101.  The first time I went there I ordered the Pad Thai.  It was definitely one of the best Pad Thai I had.  There was a good amount of shrimp, egg, and chicken.  This time I ordered the Larb, Pad Thai, an order of sushi, 2 sushi cones, and mango rice pudding.  The Larb was pretty tasteful.  However the Pad Thai didn't taste the same where it was dry and there was only 4 shrimp for like an $15 dishes. The sushi tasted kind of bland.  I order the Mango Rice pudding to go and was extremely disappointed.  There was no coconut milk used and the rice tasted like rice from couple days ago.  Definitely won't recommend the dessert.  Food cost more than other places for the same dish.  

Aside from food, the service was pretty good where the waitress came by a couple of time to make sure if everything was okay and refill water whenever low.  Lastly the waitress also stated that they had an new chef."}
{"text":"This place had a good variety of food. All the standard thai dishes as well as some sushi options. Veggie spring rolls were good, the sauce has a little spice which I liked. The ginger salad was ok, dressing was little bland. I had the pad Thai and was good, I liked that they used really thin noodles compared to most places, made it a little different. It had good taste but could have used a little more sauce as it at times was dry. My husband had the prik king and he enjoyed. I will say this place gives massive portions. You could easily have 2 or more dinners."}
{"text":"Have eaten here 3 times in the last 2 weeks and it has been AMAZING every time!  We have tried the Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, Red and Massaman curries as well as Basil Rolls and Tom Yung Goong and everything has been perfectly cooked and well balanced.  Service has been incredible and the decor is very nice.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place with both Thai food and sushi. I stopped for lunch and they have some lunch specials, but unfortunately not what I wanted..so my lunch was $15!  I think they should offer more lunch options at smaller portions and more inexpensive.  

My food was ok, not worth $15 for sure.  The waitress and bar staff were really friendly and extremely helpful.  The food came out quickly and it was hot and prepared properly.  The noodles were not the same as what I usually order at other Thai places...a different shape and size. 

Overall..ok place, a few things need changed."}
{"text":"Went to this place today and there's a sign outside that says they are on \"Vacation, and will return June 16th.\"  Today is June 16th  and they weren't open."}
{"text":"Had the rainbow roll and duck lettuce wraps and they were incredible! Quick and friendly staff"}
{"text":"The price was kind of high for what you get. Asked them to make it very spicy and it had no heat whatsoever. The flavor was good, but not $16.95 good."}
{"text":"We have tried the sushi, soup, and several of the dishes here. All in all very yummy, but not very spicy when it says spicy. Great flavors though. We had fantastic service and excellent food. Will come back often."}
{"text":"Really chill place to go! Tasty food and wonderful service. They have fantastic wine specials, although the wines are pretty basic brands. Really enjoyed my pad Thai! Lovely hostess/server. Made the experience for my girls night out even more enjoyable and relaxed!"}
{"text":"A few people suggested we try this place so we popped in for lunch. Everything tasted great. The prices are higher that lets say Thai Thai Cafe but the place is also nicer. The pad Thai noodles seemed a bit strange but the taste was good. Loved the soup and the Basil roll. Would go back for their lunch specials as well. Nice place"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic...my wife and I loved Sushi 101 near the Park Rd shopping center and were thrilled to find this place after we moved to the Lake.  Everything I've had is great, whether it's sushi rolls, sashimi pieces, or noodle dishes.  The curries are excellent too.  Add a fully-stocked bar to the mix and we go at least once a week.  Check it out, you'll be hooked too."}
{"text":"Great served. Food was delicious. Thanks for make special kid egg Frid rice for us..will be back"}
{"text":"Poor service and unappetizing food. I can honesty say I will never go back. To start we were greeted by a very nice gentleman working the bar which started our evening off on a high-note but as soon as we were seated it went downhill. 

We had 2 waitresses, who had no idea what they were doing, they were all cluelessly walking around. We then received our drinks and the next waitress asked us again what we wanted to drink (she literally just put out drinks down) so we asked her for a few mins as we contemplated leaving to go to another place across the street. She then came back and asked us what we wanted but had no knowledge of the menu. I had to ask my date what what protein she wanted with her meal since the waitress didn't bother to ask her. She also didn't know what the menu items were. 

When we received our food, it looked okay, but not $15 a plate ok. The price we paid was nowhere near worth it. The chicken in my Pad-Thai looked awful and unappetizing I didn't bother to eat it. Overall flavor and freshness was lacking. The noodles were over cooked and rubbery. We both ate about 1/4 before sending it away. 

The sushi most likely would have been a better choice but I'd try somewhere else."}
{"text":"This places food is awesome but we're pretty sure they skipped town and aren't coming back now. They've been closed since Memorial Day (and now it's June 25) and there's a letter on the door from a different business saying how they owe someone $700 or so..."}
