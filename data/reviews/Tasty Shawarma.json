{"text":"It might not look much, but the Shawarma here taste really soft and good, as in it taste Fresh, unlike most other places where the stuffing is hard and/or dried. The price is right."}
{"text":"Food was good... but staff is one star....  even didn't listen that I said PLEASE PUT THE SALAD SEPERATE ... so half of the plate was just wasted..  but the chicken was ok...  would I go there again ??????    ummmm  if I have no option..."}
{"text":"This is by far the best value you can get for a good shawarma.  The toppings are fresh and the shawarma has never fell apart on me (pet peeve of mine). Their shawarma plate is also something to consider trying.   Good service  Good Food  Clean environment"}
{"text":"Regularly order from here. Good chicken Shawarma rice plate; order Extra spicy if you can handle it. Shawarma sandwich is good also (they stopped the 2 for 1 sandwich deal, whereas their other location on Sheppard Ave East still offers it)"}
{"text":"One of the best in GTA. Good chicken Shawarma rice plate; order Extra spicy if you can handle it. Shawarma sandwich is good also"}
{"text":"Great shawarma with good seasoning on the meat. Its the only shawarma shop that I like the beef more than chicken. Oddly enough they also have really good fries. It's actually my girlfriends favorite fries. Great price for the combos! 7.99 shawarma, side fries or rice or salad, and a pop."}
{"text":"Food is good here, but if your looking for service this is not the place. You will not be greeted with a smile and its as if your bothering them when you place an order. I tried calling in advance for takeout but nobody answers. After repeated calls they just took the phone off the hook. I live 5 min away, when I arrived the place was practically empty. There was no line up to place an order. I tried calling again just to see their response. No one answered, they preferred to continue their conversation with each other. Miserable place."}
{"text":"2 shawarma for $8.25 all day everyday.  Good amount of meat and most importantly it tastes good. No line up on a Sunday night. Do take out as the place is not v warm."}
{"text":"Good Value for Markham that's 100% sure. But sometimes they could be light on the chicken so make sure u ask! Otherwise you'll need two of the wraps to fill up. Overall, great place if you're passing by and want a quick cheap but \"tasty\" quick eat."}
{"text":"Very good shawarma, came in around 9, they close 11:30 which is good. Better than other restaurants. It's not the best but above average. Will come again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Friday afternoon. Bit of a line, but orders were quick. Unfortunately, they were out of the fatoush salad but were prepping a fresh batch.   Had the mixed plate and chicken shawarma. Flavours were great especially the basmati rice. Portions were reasonable and the salad ingredients fresh.  Owner was really friendly and offered the dine-in guests a sample of some sort of traditional beverage which was sweet - somewhat like a root beer, but a bit \"medicinal\" for my liking.  Overall a great first experience and will return to try the lamb plate in the future."}
{"text":"2 shawarmas for 7.45+ tax.   I came close to noon. You could see about 4 people in line in front of me - everyone was ordering shawarma sandwiches. It took a while to get my order (almost 10 minutes) - which i thought was odd because everyone ordered the same thing - I guess they could only put a few of them in the press at a time.  Unlike many other shawarma places - there is no counter visible to you where they make the sandwich and ask you what you want on it. they just ask you if you want it spicy or extra spicy. Then they go back into the kitchen and make it.  The shawarmas are pita shaped. and there is not alot of meat in each one. and the meat was sliced too thin (it almost had the consistency of chunky tuna) The 'salad' was a bit of lettuce, some pickles and tomatos.   For the area its in (markham and 14th) there are no other shawarma places - so there is nothign to compare for the price - but this palce does not really compare to the shawarma places up and down lawrence around vic park.   I am giving it 3 stars because of the wait time, and the so-so shawarma. I am going to go back to make sure I didn't get a 'one off' experience since others have better things to say - and i might order a dinner next time to see what that is like.  the dining room and washrooms were clean and the seating is a bunch of booths which I thought was nicer than most shawarma places that are more of 'pick up' places."}
{"text":"It was my first time here. I didnt know what to order and the owner was very nice and gratious in letting me try a sample of the beef and chicken. They were both delicious! Very well seasoned and beef was especially sooo juicy in my opinion. I ordered the beef combo. While waiting, I observed the owner making much conversation with many of the customers and making many laugh. Its nice to see an owner upfront in the business, doing the labour and interacting with his customers ensuring that their satisfied with his food all in one. You can tell he really cares about customer satisfaction and the work he puts into it.  My beef combo was delicious. I seriously dont know whats the deal with others but my beef was bomb.....so juicy and tasty..... The salad was also very fresh with the vegetables and the sauces on the salad and meat were great too. Overall my experience was great here and I would definitely come back again to try their different items!"}
{"text":"Just recently went there... Best deal for chicken shawarmas!!! This is my new favorite spot now for a quick meal..."}
{"text":"Just tried the shawarma sandwich, wow what a let down.  I know markham is pretty much devoid of any Arabic restaurants, but come on this has to be a cruel joke.  Head lettuce, white field onions, garlic sauced watered down tahini no pickeled turnips, sliced tomatoes (really???).  To call these shawarma, is an insult.  Took two bites and threw it away.  Should have known better.  Do yourself a favor, try the places around Lawrence ave even arz bakery has a hands down better sandwich.    Edited:   Since the owner has spam replied to a majority of the reviews with low or shall we say, the same recurring theme : The shawarma  is not on par, or even decent (only tried the beef personally, and did not get sick from the two bites to be fair).    \"Usually, we put lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pick , tahini, garlic sauce and hot sauce and we leave turnipe pickles , parsley and hummus optional for the customers to add them, and that is why I said this review does not say any truth about what we serve\"  from the owner....  So you put lettuce, none roasted tomato (from the spit), pickles, garlic sauce(which has always been a chicken  default), hot sauce and tahini(cut lemon) by default on beef shawarma without a question, but pickled turnip is a sin???  ....     I asked if pickled turnips, was on the sandwich or available, was given a blank stare, and \"no\".  Even pointed them out on the menu pic.....   Unless something happened, on that ill fated day, that I entered this place of business.     And, for some strange unexplained reason, all stars of wrong lined up....  I stand by my review.    I think a drop in is required, to check out if they have improved to be fair.  or wait   11 infractions, for an owner who treats the food/kitchen as his own, who claimed higher standards then dine safe.......  reply to Sara K. on yelp \" would like to take this opportunity to tell my customers I really respect them and I do treat the kitchen and treat the food like my food and my kitchen at home and I'm confident to say I have very high standards higher then health department  Such a stupid review\"    that river in Egypt,  whats it called?"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for over five years and the taste, value, and customer service has been consistent since day one. I usually go for lunch during the week and for dinner on the weekends. If you go during weekday lunch time (between 12pm-2pm), the line-up can be near the door (approx. 7-10 people in line) and these people can order multiple orders at once and the time to wait really isn't that bad. I can still get in, eat (I eat fast, tho), and leave within my lunch hour. When I go at dinner time on Friday/Saturday the line-up isn't as long (I'd like to think I always beat the rush). The meat and ingredients are always fresh and delicious. I really like this place. I introduced it to my SO and he loves it too. I've offered it to my LO too and while she isn't a fan of rice (in general), she loves the chicken shawarma. LOL. All staff and owner are very nice and they're all quick when prepping the food (sometime that is key when you have long line-ups). I've never received a wrong order. Oh, and I love the hot sauce... very tasty and spicy. I always get extra."}
{"text":"I eat here a few times a week.  It's great food and good value.  I usually order the lamb dinner which is a lamb shank served with rice and salad.  The lamb is delicious.  I would recommend offering some alternatives to salad and rice, such as roasted potatoes, fries, etc.  It can be boring to get the same thing every time."}
{"text":"If you believe deep down that Markham isn't the place for good shawarma....this place isn't going to disabuse you of such stereotypes. It's not BAD but it's not the greatest Arab food you've ever had. If you get hungry and want to avoid the traffic on 14th, might be a good option."}
{"text":"I needed a quick lunch and attracted by the fancy shawarma signs. I ordered the chicken shawarma, which tasted OK (not the best. The sandwich can be warmer). The price is good- 2 shawarma for $9 ($5 for 1, $7 for combo). I came during weekend lunch, it seems that there are alot of \"eater\" traffic. However you can find seats easily, as 85% of traffic takeouts.  The cashier service is OK, a little slow waiting for food."}
{"text":"The food here is good but the service is really and i mean really slow. The restaurant was empty and it still took over 15 minutes to make a shawarma. I guess it goes to show you the food is really fresh but everywhere else i go to get shawarma never takes that long.  Pros: cheap, tastes good Cons: slow service"}
{"text":"Good food and employees. But terrible service in terms of wait time. Every time I go I have to wait an unreasonable amount of time for just ONE Shawarma wrap. It would help if they took orders on the phone but they don't even do that."}
{"text":"We ordered two shawarmas and got either panzarotti's or the worst shawarma wrapping skills I have ever seen. Took about 20 minutes to make these too, not even sure how that's possible lol"}
{"text":"Good food, great price! Clean and tidy restaurant, bathroom a little warm. Staff very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"A few reasons why this is one of the best shawarma places in town.  1) They wrap shawarma as a half moon instead of a cylinder. How many times have you bit into your shawarma and gotten a mouthful of only veggies or only meat? That's the result of a cylinder wrap. At tasty, you get a mouthful of everything on every bite. Because the half moon is flatter and has layered ingredients. Makes a huge difference in flavor.  2) I like spice. The pepper sauce at most places has too much  vinegar which takes over the flavor of the shawarma. Tasty has nice balance when adding heat.  3) the ingredients looked fresh. I hate looking into the serving dishes that my shawarma maker is taking ingredients from and seeing wilted brown lettuces and sliver - thin sliced wizened tomatoes. Tasty's ingredients seemed fresh.   Want to take this shawarma to the next level? Add a little bit more quantity of ingredients and Tahini to keep it juicy. And it would be hands down the best shawarma in the city.  Hope you enjoy it."}
{"text":"Almost got fired from my work! Waited 20 min for a shawarma and my break finished, couldn't make it back to work on time. Tried to call in advance and they finally answered after multiple attempts and said I have to spend at least $20 to call in advance. Worst service ever"}
{"text":"Here's the good, bad and the rest I leave to you to make your own mind :)  Good: 1. Tasty shawarma 2. Friendly service (easy to add extra topping +$0.50) 3. Value for money - good portion for $4.75 + tax   Bad: 1. Not so organized  2. Don't carry hummus / green pickles 3. Personal (everybody has their preference) but I think the pita is just wrapped in excess bread - they can reduce it to half :) 4. Perhaps just my luck - found a tiny piece of bone in the chicken shawarma"}
{"text":"big fan of this place for lunch! I work in the area and this is a great place to grab a delicious and cheap lunch. Combos (shawarma, drink, and rice/salad/fries for $7 with tax!) or just a shawarma wrap on its own for just over $4 with tax. Solid strip mall place, without having to trek all the way to the Lawrence area."}
{"text":"I usually eat shawarma at Joe's but they're closed on Sundays and I had a craving. I saw this place while driving on Yonge.  I had the chicken shawarma plate with rice and a side of potato wedges. Wow. The potato wedges were the best I've had, fresh, crunchy outside, and soft inside. The chicken shawarma was incredibly tasty, and cooked perfectly. Their flavoured basmati rice was much better than the  plain yellow rice that I get from other places.   The hot sauce had a nice amount of heat without that vinegar taste that you get from Frank's hot sauce, I loved it. Tahini sauce was standard.   It was quite a long wait for my takeout though, about 25 minutes, but they were busy. All-in-all, I'll probably start eating here as my main shawarma place, I'll just call ahead next time. 10/10  $9.50 for chicken shawarma plate  $2.99 for a side of potato wedges"}
{"text":"Always order your food ahead of time. This place is always packed around lunch so it takes forever to get your food"}
{"text":"Tasty Shawarma is my go-to spot for shawarma in Markham.   I've been here several times as this is the closest shawarma place near me and I give it a solid 4. If you're in the area and want something that's good, quick and extremely affordable, you can't go wrong with Tasty Shawarma. They have a deal for 2 shawarma for under $10 which is really great and I get it every time.  The shawarma's are pretty filling, you can either choose beef or chicken OR you can get mixed which is what I always get (best of both worlds)! If you choose to get spicy, make sure you can handle spice because they do add quite a bit of hot sauce.   If you get a combo, you'll also get their wedges, which have never dissatisfied. Crispy and golden, they go great with my meal.   Will definitely be back as it's my go-to."}
{"text":"Wow. Where do I start?   First of all, the portions were very very small. The sauces had an awful taste.  I have had numerous shawarmas in the past and this one was by far the worst one! I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Wait time is worrying (10-15 min) so not the best choice for those in a hurry; the shawarma wrap itself is good and made with above average ingredients (lettuce is more fresh than at other family owned places) but the meat may be a bit dry at times and lack some of the juiciness found in the meat at other places."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple times since its close to my house and every time i regret going back. There has not been once that they prepare my order the way I tell"}
{"text":"Good place for a quick bite. We ordered the shawrama special with half a dozen of falafel. We paid a total of $15. Awesome price for how much food we got ! The only problem is the cleaniness of the place. The people who worked there would pick up pieces of chicken that fell out on to the chopping board / table and shove it back into the shwarama... Again, not a bad place to grab a quick bite but you've been warned"}
{"text":"Not a bad place if you have want to get some grub on. Love the $7.99 for 2 sandwich deal. Def worth a try."}
{"text":"This is the cheapest place I have ever been to. I ordered fries and the guy working tonight tried to give me fries that were sitting in the fryer. I asked him to make me a new one and we waited ten minutes. We waited all that time just to witness him throw the same old fries back in the deep fryer and give that to us. Not only did he waste my money but he wasted our time. He knows nothing about food service and this place just lost 2 customers over cheap fries that costs  them nothing. Hope they close."}
{"text":"Totally worth visiting this place...cheap delicous shawarma! Love this garlic and hot sauce. Perfect for quick take out."}
{"text":"One of the best shawarmas in the city, and definitely an incredible value. For under $4 per sandwich, it's cheaper than fast food but far more fresh and flavorful. Great owner and always a positive experience."}
{"text":"My go to place for shawarma! Love the chicken shawarma and the potato wedges! The portion is huge and the price is fair which makes me continuously going back again and again. Also there are lots of spacious seating area (large booths) for customers. Would definitely recommend this place to those who looking for some fresh shawarmas!"}
{"text":"Sub standard shawarma sandwiches. Not sure you can call this a shawarma spot because you don't see the shawarma rotisserie. False advertising in my opinion. The sandwich is made in the kitchen behind closed doors out of sight. the meat seasoning is poor. Have tried this spot twice thinking I'll give a 2nd chance. Worse off 2nd time around. Ordered and paid for beef shawarma for takeaway and got a chicken sandwich instead. Shawarma quality remains sub standard."}
{"text":"My fav shawarma place.  Always fresh.  They recently made there own hot sauce concoction which is really good also.  The owner is always friendly.  Their chicken shawarma is perfect.  Noon is always busy."}
{"text":"They have a special of 2 shawarmas for $10 incl. tax.  They tasted quite good in my opinion, and the deal is pretty good.  Altho, the size of each shawarma is about 80% the size of other shawarmas (e.g. Pita Land), but still a good deal.  The toppings are the standard toppings found in most places, so no surprises.  The 'hot' sauce isn't hot though.  Couldn't taste the 'hot' at all.  4-stars due to the good price deal.  C.L."}
{"text":"Love this place - inexpensive and delicious! Two good size Shawarmas (chicken or beef) for $10 (taxes in). The place is simple and clean (although I often just take it to go). The staff is always friendly and quick. Love their hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Came here on Dec 19th 2016.  I placed my order at 8:40pm.  It was a chicken shawarma sandwich to go. I wanted something quick and easy. At the time I was order number 13 and order 10 was just called. My shawarma was not ready until closer to 9pm, it took 20 minutes to get my food ready. I only found myself looking at my receipt after it took so long. Not like the 2 orders ahead were large orders either one was 2 pitas and the other was shawarma dinner. I eat shawarma once a week from the place by my work, the average time to get my food ready is 2-10 mins at peak times.   This is my second time coming here and most likely my last.  How was my chicken shawarma? I wish I could tell you but when I got home with the food and took a few bites. I realized they made a beef shawarma instead. This shows me a lack of care and attention to their patrons, safe to say my experience has not gone well at all. A quick bite turned into 1.5 hr dinner because I made myself some instant noodles after I threw out the shawarma."}
{"text":"Best deal in town! 2 Shawarma for $9.50!! Wowsers! Always a busy spot at lunch. Come here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"I always get the 2 of the 2x shawarma deal for $10. Really good shawarma for the price, although I would prefer Abrahams in scarborough but it's further than I'd like to go for shawarma.   Only 2 or 3 people work at a time so expect to wait awhile if there is a lineup. Ordering ahead helps."}
{"text":"Good shawarmas for the price. They have a 10 dollar for 2 shawarma deal. They're very filling.   Be sure to call ahead and order since they don't have much staff and easily get overwhelmed when it's busy."}
{"text":"Chicken plates killing my wallet.  This is my go to comfort take-out food and it rarely fails to satisfy.  The homemade hot sauce is great and in combination with the other sauces makes the combination of flavours superb.  I've been a customer since the place opened and will continue to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for quick meal. Initially ordered chicken sharwama but it was not ready. So switched to beef combo. I am cautious with beef lot of places serve it dry, for that reason I asked for a sample.   The beef was tender and beautifully seasoned, so i ordered it. Combo came with potato wedges which were crisp not soggy.  Would order again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best lamb shank plate in Toronto and GTA. The potato wedges and falafels are amazing too. You can't beat this place in value for money for any item on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad at all. Most of the seats are booths, which are surprisingly large despite the restaurant's fairly small size. I had a beef burger which was alright and reasonably priced. The wait for the food was not excessive, and the cashiers were friendly enough. A-OK.  I would recommend trying the shawarma as it looks delicious - I was in a bit of a rush otherwise I may have opted for one myself :)"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. The staff members have no customer service skills what so ever. Unlike most traditional shawarma places the sandwiches are made in the back and not in front of you so you don't get to pick your toppings. When I asked how to select what my sandwich would have WHILE paying the cashier gets mad and snaps saying you should have told me before ordering. Okay.. It's my first time visiting your restaurant so maybe explain how the process works or ask if I'm okay with all the standard toppings and I could explain I'm not? On top of that they yell out your order number when giving you the food. The girl yells out the order number and looks straight at me. I apologize saying I wasn't given a receipt so I'm not sure what my order number is. She replies \"yeah, it's yours. the one with all the last minute changes\" to which I calmly explained that her coworker did not once asked me how I'd like the sandwich. Great job guys, will never come back despite this being down the street from my dads place."}
{"text":"Great place to stop in for lunch. Had the chicken shwarma combo with fries. All the veggies were fresh and the fries head the perfect crisp. All for 9 bucks."}
{"text":"Really good value for the price. I usually get the 2 for 1 special...i like how the shawarma's feel more like a wrap compared to the pita sandwiches that i usually eat in the Willowdale area. high Quality toppings and is wonderful to bite into its crispy pita shell when it is taken out of the toaster!"}
{"text":"Loved this place up until my last visit 3 days ago.  Ordered 2 of their chicken shawarma specials for $7.75 (that's 4 total). I also ordered a side of garlic sauce.    Now I've been going here for years but what i saw made my stomach turn. I noticed when the guy came back from the kitchen with the garlic sauce, his right hand was covered with sauce!!!  I mean his whole palm, not just his fingers. The sauce on his hands smeared the take out bag completely.   What do you think  happened here?!?!"}
{"text":"Good tasting food but the employees don't look the most presentable. And they dont accept either debit or credit ( one or the other i cant remember) and they are kind of rude sometimes."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken shawarma wrap and a beef shawarma plate to go. The cashier was kind and immediately notified the chef when I changed from a chicken plate to a beef plate. There was a good 15-20 minute wait although we were the only customers that ordered something at that time. The seats and TVs helped time past.  Food was mediocre. The wrap had less meat and much more vegetables as compared to other restaurants but it was less than $5. This was my first time having beef shawarma and I was satisfied.  There could be more sauce on both or at least on the side.  Will be returning to try other dishes."}
{"text":"There are a few locations and the one in usually at is by pharmacy and sheppard. I work around this location though and decided to give it a try.   It's a lot nicer inside and there are a lot of seats compared to the pharmacy location. It is more modern and welcoming.   The food isbpretty much the same. Tasty and juicy. The only thing they don't do is make it in front of you. You also have to ask for the pickled beats (which I'm in love with) and they also have pickles!   Service was friendly and fast. The guys were super accommodating and polite.  Will definitely be back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"You know what?  They were right, it is tasty.  Pretty much JASPASM (Just Another Shwarma Place At a Strip Mall), but better.  $7 all in for a combo with fries.  Luckily I got in before the massive line formed behind me.  It's a steady flow all thru lunch."}
{"text":"This is a very bang for your buck kind of place. Taste is very good too. You can get a combo for $7+ tax which includes a sandwich, a side, and a pop. If you're a big eater, try their 2 shawarmas for $8.85 (exactly $10 inc tax). Their shawarma sandwiches are HUGE and they load them with meat.   Around lunch time they are packed and that's a sign that they are doing something right. I would come here again for take out lunch. It's not a very nice place to sit and eat."}
{"text":"Two shawarma sandwiches for $8.25. You can't beat the price. But they are so so. Bread was stale and vegetables were not very fresh. Chicken was excellent though. I would give it a three stars because it is after all a fast food place. You can't really expect too much. If you want really good authentic fresh shawarma, you gotta go downtown yonge street."}
{"text":"Came here for their falafel sandwich. I ordered mine with no garlic sauce. Sandwich was loaded and tasty as advertised. They also sell falafel as a plate and as a side order. Nice clean decor. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Ok at best. No pita or hummus with the shawarma plate. Salad was super plain. Rice is rice. Restaurant was clean and service fast is not very friendly. Honestly, shawarma should be a super easy meal to knock out of the Park. They didn't."}
{"text":"Nice clean place.. Food is good.. Price is reasonable.. Too slow service even when you are the only customer.."}
{"text":"2 shwarmas for $10 taxes in? Sold! The shwarma itself is good! , the spicy sauce is a little spicy, some days more than others. The raw onion is quite pungent. The wait can be very long though so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"Great shawarma for the area, and cheap!  Hot sauce is a nice touch too.  Lunch rush can be crazy though!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Service is kinda slow but maybe that's because they are busy! The chicken or beef shawarma sandwich ($6) a hit. Sometimes if I feel like switching it up, the the shawarma plate for $10 is good too. You can opt out for less rice and add more salad cuz they fill it up with a lot of rice! If you don't like to wait, I suggest you to call your order in and pick it up in 15 minutes so you don't have to wait! Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Great prices for tasty filling shawarma wraps and dinner plates. I think they have a two for $8.99 special. The workers here are nice.  Location is in a small dinky plaza on sheppard so you may miss it when driving by as the sign isnt noticeable.  Also limited space/small restaurant, BUT they do have several tables to enjoy your freshly assembled food."}
{"text":"3.5 At the end of the day I was craving shawarma, and to be honest this hit the spot.  A bit of a hole in the wall, don't expect much in terms of decor or ambience or service.  Definitely a fast food joint, but the food was good, and it was a awesome portion.  I got a mixed chicken and beef shawarma pita and it was tasty, as well as the salad that came with it on the side as a combo.  Its not the best i've had, and it surely is not close to the worse."}
{"text":"Went there the other day. Wont be back ordered falafel plate which came with rice, salad ( which they should just say lettuce) cause they dont have dressing.  Falafel its self was tasty however for $11 it should come with typical sides of hummus, tahini and tabule. Pictures showed it was suppose to come with pickled turnip but they didnt have any. When i asked if the could sub garlic and hot sauce for hummus the guy said yes but when he served my plate and i asked for the side if hummus he said i would have to pay 2.99 for it $15?!?!?? For 6 falafel and hummus. And a full plate of rice.  Falafels were a 4. Hummus a 3 and service, because they dont seem to understand ppl very well. A zero"}
{"text":"This is a cheap reasonably tasty food. Shwarma are not out of this World but does the job and I like there burgers. The shawarma plate is intesting, it might taste more like Greek food but there are some shawarma elements. Anyway its a good place for quick low priced food."}
{"text":"Decent and filling schawarma, but it could do with some more fresh-cut-flavour. It doesn't taste as fresh as I've had (I also prefer it when I see them freshly cut the meat off the stick, which they don't here.) It's definitely on the bland side.  Two for $9.50 is a solid price though.  Comes with pickles, tomatoes, lettuce, maybe onions too, along with tahini sauce."}
{"text":"Meh I have had tastier more authentic shawarma. Price is good but I wouldn't say it was super tasty. I had the chicken shawarma plate."}
{"text":"The meat has a decent taste, but the amount they put in the sandwich is too little. If it is 100g as they say, it needs to be more than that. Toppings are nothing special, neither is their pita. They're consistent and friendly but that's the most they have going for them."}
{"text":"Good but not great.   You know the old expression \"bigger isn't always better\" it applies to Tasty Shwarma.  The flavour of the meat is good, the service is friendly and quick. It's in an easily accessible area by car and parking is fine.   The pitas though are too big.  The put a standard amount of meat in them which is fine but the pitas are so huge they have to fill the space with so much salad, pink turnip, parsley, onions etc.  Now don't get me wrong I love all those ingredients but when you are just getting bite after bite of pink turnip it's not so good.     If suppose you could just ask for half of the quantity of veggies but you shouldn't have to.    * Note that the restaurant in the photo above with the nice new building is not the Tasty Shawarma at 2993 Sheppard.  This one is in an old run down looking strip mall.  Not the nice new one in the mall above."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for burgers. Not sure about previous reviews but I've been a regular here for the past couple years at this location and the one on Sheppard. You can't beat the taste for the prices. The burgers are mouth watering. I have a friend that comes from Mississauga just for the burgers. This isn't a fancy restaurant it is a restaurant that will hit the spot. From what I know the owner grinds the meat fresh everyday and uses top quality beef. Make sure you put garlic sauce on the burgers ;)"}
{"text":"I really like this place. My only gripe is that at night/evening, the Sheppard location makes the shawarmas really sloppily, with no care. There's one or two workers in particular that are really careless in how they make the shwarmas. Other than that it's a good restaurant."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite shawarma places to go to. It's got the best bang for your buck!!! Everything tastes fresh and the services is always friendly. Dad approved too!!!"}
{"text":"I had a long break from Tasty Shawarma. I tried the competition nearby (huge disappointment) and another 10 min away (which has closed down) I wanted to be fair & give Tasty Shawarma another shot. Afterall, we have been regulars since they opened.  HUGE improvement! Portions (we always order the combo plates) were great, chicken fresh & still seasoned better than most places in Markham. Tabouleh is always fresh and made well and i haven't tried tahini or garlic sauce like theirs anywhere in Markham! My kids still love the food there. I grew up eating Middle Eastern & Mediterranean food.  Happy to have gone back and happy that we will continue to get great food from there! Our experiences are always with take-out."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and tried the chicken shawarma plate for takeout. I must say it was indeed really tasty!!! One of the best I've had for a while. Living outside of Toronto for a while, I had forgotten how good shawarma taste like. The menu seemed a bit limited but i always just get the chicken shawarma roll up or plate anyway.  Food: 4.5  Price: 3.5 considering the portions i'd expect the food to be a bit cheaper compared to other shawarma places  Service: N/A for now (I may update on my future visits)"}
{"text":"I got the beef shawarma sandwich here ($6 including tax). It was alright. The veggies in it were fresh. The lettuce had a nice crunch to it. I thought some of the beef was a tad dry though. There was also a bit too much sauce in it for my liking.   It was nice and clean inside and lots of seating is available.   The food here is cheap. There was a sign outside the place advertising:  2 shawarma for $9.50 2 falafel for $8.85 2 burgers for $7.99   Overall a decent place that I would visit again"}
{"text":"UPDATE: This is in response to the owner's original reply (he has since changed his responses to the all the Yelp reviews below 3 stars, and removed all his negative comments) to my first review below.   I respect everyone's right to express their opinion in a respectful manner. I'm sure there are people who like the food here, that's their choice and I respect that as well. If you take the time to read my reviews and look at my pictures from Ruby's Mediterranean Cuisine and Shawarma Empire you'll understand my 2 star rating of this place.   I stand by my rating and I will even do you a favor by not lowering it more even though in your original response you said I didn't deserve good food and never to come back. I do hope things change and I honestly and sincerely do wish you well."}
{"text":"Food: 4-4.5/5... Excellent shawarma. Great value. $9 for 2 shawarmas. Quantity: great for lunch. You can have one for lunch and one for dinner... If you eat both- youll be stuffed. Service: friendly. Ordered at the front for take out. Sat and waited about 5-8mins.   Ordered: Beef and chicken shawarma sandwiches. ( you can order mixed as well which is now my order). Very good. Very Tasty and fresh. Takes a few minutes to make it.. Been back now multiple times. Can't go wrong with shawarma sandwich.  Sauces: Hot sauce tahini & Garlic sauce- I request a bit more   If you are a big eater- like me- you can eat both but youll be stuffed.  Like bedtime and done for the day. Lol well worth it."}
{"text":"Good Falafel , very friendly staff and very tasty sauce. Cheapest price   2 falafel for 7.5$  that's cheap."}
{"text":"My falafel wrap tasted good, except for that the wrap was a bit too toasted and was a bit crunchy.   My beef shawarma wrap; the beef was tasteless and the wrap itself was too toasted."}
{"text":"A bit overhyped place. I had their chicken shawarma plate, which came out to $10 after tax. The first turn-off was when I noticed that they had pre-cut way too much meat (it wasn't even busy). I prefer the meat to be cut fresh off the rack when ordered.  In my opinion, there was too little rice. The meat just tasted okay. Right after eating, my stomach isn't feeling too well. Maybe it's because they left the pre-cut chicken meat out for God knows how long.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Such a nice and clean restaurant. Tons of space to sit and it's so modern and chic. It looks like a high end restaurant love the decor. The cashier and chef were soooo friendly and kind. Maybe because of the hour the shawarma sandwich took a little longer to make. Taste was above average but we waited to get home to eat it so it doesn't do it justice. Will have to try again. Also price is right!!"}
{"text":"I eat here often, the food quality is good and the food tastes great, the portions are generous, I love the beef shawarma, the meat is tender yet well done. The potato wedges are a treat. The service could be friendlier."}
{"text":"I recommend this place if you like shawarma plates.  Can't go wrong with shawarma plate for around $10, very fresh ingredients.  Very happy with the food. On Fri Apr 7th, I was in the neighborhood and looked for a Middle Eastern food nearby on my phone and this place popped up and went to this place for the first time.  Semi-busy with visible large chicken and beef shawarma spindles. This is NOT a full-service restaurant. It's a fast food take out place with limited seating area. I was looking for cheap and good. They were featuring a burger combo on their sign as well.  Hmmmm, is this authentic Shawarma place?? I wondered. But I guess there's not too much around here to support the business so you gotta do what you gotta do to survive, maybe there is a school nearby and the burger menu maybe helps bring in the student crowd I reasoned.  Anyhow, I was tempted by two shawarma wraps at a discount but decided to go for the plate since I was hungry. The staff was friendly and they accommodated my request for 1/2 beef and 1/2 chicken shawarma plate. It was a good sized portion and was real tasty including the rice! Got everything all the veggies including the slaw & pickled pink radish with the salad.  I like Middle Eastern food and have tried shawarma plates at lots of different restaurants and this one qualifies as being pretty good in my books! I will definitely come back again to this place if I'm in the neighborhood! :)"}
{"text":"So... I had loved this place. Told everyone about it.. I would usually call in and make an order as I am usually on the road between sessions this way I can grab my food to go. I would ask to make sure they had some of the menus readily available, and in so that I would have to waste my time or theirs or customer behind me in a line up.    That being said I have called this place around 10 times in two weeks. Of those 10 times 9 of them never answered the phone.  (Yes I called during their opened hours)  Today was the 10th...   Correction.. 10th and 11th.   The 10th tine I called someone answered the phone.. but put me right on hold.. then hung up...   So I called back... The 11th time ... Someone answered and it sounded like they said please hold....  So I did...   They had the phone not on hold so I can hear things were busy... Which is good for their business.   The it seems about a minute later the person picked up the phone and hung up on me.   I dunno man.. I really want to give these guys my business and their prices are good and so is the good... But this kinda treatment just can't continue  Sooooo..  I have learned this in life.  You may have the best product in the world... But you business will suffer if... You relations with you staff and (in my case and expecially) you customers faulters.   Life is about relationships.... And how we manage em.  The food is good  The treatment ... Need some improvement.   For the record. No one ever said anything bad or was ever rude. They seemed pleasent enough.   But trying to reach them. Being placed on hold.. never recently getting to speak to anyone...  That will send customers to their competitors...   *** For the record... This is the second time that they have placed me on hold. The first time ever I was placed on hold for close to 15 mins. The placed the phone down so again I can hear everything that is happening there... I was in my car driving to their location. I had arrived at their location.... Hung up my phone.. and let the person behind the counter now that they may as well hang up their phone now cause I am here... No long on the line...."}
{"text":"The food has gone downhill. They've recently renovated, so the seats are more comfortable, but I don't eat in anyways. The prices have gone up, and quality has definitely gone down. The chicken shawarmas are lacking in flavor and their wraps are full of filler veggies and huge chunks of lettuce. I might as well be eating a veggie wrap if there's barely any chicken in it! The only plus still are their falafels. Got 4 falafel sandwiches today and they came spicy when I didn't ask for it. I hope they step up their game."}
{"text":"Basically my go to shawarma place in the scarborough area, don't be fooled by the look of the plaza. Great place to get your shawarma fix. Good value for what you're getting. Depending when you go you may need to wait a bit especially during the lunch and dinner rush. They have good deals like the 2 shawarmas or 2 burgers deal."}
{"text":"Love the place best quality to price you pay. I have tried the chicken shawarma and falafel sandwiches which are both great. Now you can get two chickens for 10 and two falafels for 9. The place is new and the prices seem to get more as the two shawarma chicken used to be 9 so hurry up and grab the best prices middle easter place around city. The place is well decorated and well done it seemed as a high class restaurant except you have to get your own service. The washrooms are good as well and service are casual and nice I think the people working are the owners and the family. Love to have a good middle Eastern food close by."}
{"text":"They recently renovated so the place looks a lot nicer than when I first had Tasty Shawarma.   All the toppings are fresh, and their sauces seem housemade. The chicken and the beef are both excellent, which is a good sign, as many shawarma places have bad beef shawarma or simple don't offer it. Their burgers are good too, though not as good as their shawarma sandwiches. Their fries, while I believe they are frozen and bought, are still very crispy and made fresh to order, so I can't complain.  They have a 2-for-$10 deals for shawarma sandwiches and I believe 2-for-$8 or $9 for their burgers, which are greats deals for the quality and amount you get."}
{"text":"I'd give it 5 stars but it seems like everytime I visit the place the price of the 2 for 1 shawarma increases and the amount of meat they stuff in decreases . but I still come back and get my shawarma fix. I love the potato wedges as well. also, the shawarma dinner is decent. needs to work on their staff cause sometimes there's a line and it takes a while for them to prepare the orders. happened to me a lot of times where I just went out and got a subway sandwich instead."}
{"text":"Good value wow! $10 for 2 wraps.  Tasted pretty good.  Nothing much to complain.  There's also a pretty decent size seating area for customers.  The seating is decently comfy.  Environment pretty nice for a sharwarma place.  This place exceeded my expectations in terms of decor & seating.  Found this place on yelp through reviews which pricing I saw I just didn't expect the decor, which is a bonus."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for some years now for my Sharwama's, its located in a small plaza on the south side of Sheppard Ave East and Pharmacy in Scarborough. There's also another small plaza parallel to this one where another Sharwama store is located as well. The prices at Tasty Sharwama is reasonable, I usually get the Chicken Sharwama's plate at a cost of $10.65 tax included. The food is good, the meat is tasty, I mean I eat everything... The toppings are fresh but I think it may be fresher during the days. Overall I have no complaints regarding the food quality. The store is clean, the service is good as the workers are younger guys, nice and friendly, chatting with customers, from what I've seen anyways. This is my go to place for Sharwarma's in Scarborough. My wife prefers their competitor in the other plaza though."}
{"text":"Great food. Really fresh. Halal.  Coming from a smaller city I was really excited to try this place. I have only been in the city for four days and this is my second trip here.   I had the chicken wrap both times. They guys were really quick to make it even though there was a line."}
{"text":"\"looking for shawarma? This place has it\"   Listen if you're looking for Shawarma, this place has it and menu is pretty straight forward and prices arent bad. How does it taste? Good. How was everything? Fine. Listen for Shawarma it's hard to really complain or rate extreme in any direction. I've had it from Windsor, Toronto, Ottawa, London, etc.  All places that have significant middle eastern populations and shawarma places.  This one has a nice dining area, but the spits are hidden. Couldn't see them which I guess takes away from the whole Shawarma experience. Nothing really differentiates it and sometimes thats okay. All of the flavours are there. Meat was a little dry but that's to be expected. The seasoning and spices were fine. Got the two shawarma special and a dinner mixed plate. Not bad. They also accepted my yelp coupon too.   3.5 out of 5.0. About average and not bad."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick shawarma. Price is great. $5.99 for a chicken shawarma sandwich taxes in.   While the reviews weren't that great, I found the shawarma to be great bang for buck. Chicken was flavourful and tender. The pita was thin and nicely toasted. Veggies were fresh and the hummus and tahini was tasty.   Great value."}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich and the beef burger was amazing. Full of flavour and perfectly cooked.  The chicken plate was decent. Nice, clean and decent place.  Would go again for the sandwich and burger (with potato wedges)."}
{"text":"Shawarma wraps for 9.50..so fresh and juicy. Great proportion of meat and salad in combination with the tastiest garlic and hot sause nicely toasted. My husband had the mix  plate and he loved it.. I would highly recommend this place..you are not going to be disappointed.."}
{"text":"My to go place when I am craving shawarma. Awesome and delicious wrap always fresh..the meat is so tasty I can eat it every day..The plates are huge. They come with rice,salad and sauses...All the sauses are homemade..made from scratch...the personal is always nice and friendly..quick service..highly recommended"}
{"text":"No doubt the best halal burgers in town. So delicious. I've been craving a burger from them ever since I first went there last month"}
{"text":"This place takes me right back to the late 1990s when food was delicious and cheap! For $7.75 I can get two shawarmas? Are you kidding me!?!  The food quality is phenomenal and the price can't be beat! If you want to add on some fries into the Shawarma you'll have to tack on another $0.50, but for less than $10 you can still walk out with two delicious shawarmas! One will surely fill your belly but two Will put you over the top... That being said I just polished off two...  It's hard to find a place that sells delicious beef Shawarmas so I'm glad to have found this place,! They are definitely not stingy with the filling or the toppings. Unfortunately cash and debit only but a small price to pay for a delicious meal.   I'll be back so you'll be sure to see me. Strong 5 out of 5 Stars for price and taste."}
{"text":"Another good shawarma place, suffers a little with Family shawarma just the other side of Pharmacy."}
{"text":"The best Shawarma in the city! I've been coming to Tasty for approx. 4 years now and it only seems to get better. The hot sauce is the best I've had and the service is great!"}
{"text":"After reading all the good reviews I had high hopes for this place. I went in to check it out and got a chicken shawarma plate.   There was a line up and the guys behind the counter worked well enough to keep the line going. The place itself has a small seating area and it wasn't overtly dirty but it wasn't very clean either. There's also some random rectangular hole in the floor near the door. It's has short metal sides that jut up from the floor. Kinda odd and hazardous.   The chicken and the rice were made well and the portion size was decent too. The pickled turnip was more acidic tasting than most other places. But the biggest problem I had with this place was the garlic sauce. It was so subdued with no bite. The tahini sauce overpowered the garlic sauce!! Tahini. Overpowering garlic.... I was shocked and let down. Also they don't have roasted potatoes. Just french fries.   To those that enjoy a good deal (and don't mind garlic sauce tasting like plain creamy sauce) they have 2 shawarmas for $7.75.   I can put up with weird hazardous rectangular holes for good food but they lost me at their (un)garlic sauce."}
{"text":"If your looking for a quick bite to eat then this is the place to go. I would consider this mostly a take-out place, but there are 5-6 tables inside if you choose to dine in. Few tips: 1) Lunch hour is busy....I mean real busy. Although they work fast I would say it would take 20min minimum for you to grab your food and leave depending on the line 2) If you want extra anything in your shawarma it costs 25 cents....sometimes they are nice, but for the most part it will cost extra 3) 2 shawarma are $10 after tax and you can have chicken, beef or a mix of both in one.  As for the shawarma, I've personally never had tomatoes in a shawarma so its quite odd if you choose to add it. The actual taste of the meat is not very strong, but not terrible either. For the price, I would say the value is there, but if you are looking for something authentic that will blow your mind it is best to go elsewhere.  *Edit: Clearly my review hit a nerve with the owner as my personal preference of taste can be considered lies. I'll stand by my rating of 2.5-3."}
{"text":"First time trying Tasty Shawarma but it's not bad especially for the price. I went there around 5:30-6pm and had to wait for 2-3 people in front of me but it was ok. It's a small takeout joint with a couple of tables for customers to eat.   It's 10.00$ for a Chicken or Beef Shawarma Plate which includes rice and salad. You can opt for fries instead of the rice but it's a decent portion. Rice wasn't super fresh this time around. I got the Beef Shawarma to see if it was as good as the Chicken Shawarma which everyone raves about here. It was ok but not out of this world. I would come back since it's inexpensive and OK.   There are specials available here too for the burgers and shawarma wraps. It's good if you're looking for a quick and inexpensive bite."}
{"text":"Great shawarma joint in Scarborough!  They provide quick service during the lunch hour, but it can get quite busy at times and you may have to wait in line for a few minutes. They have a few tables and seats probably for approximately 15-20 people at the most. Many people just get takeout and bring it back to work, like what my coworkers and I do! They have shawarma wraps and meals. They also have a deal where you buy two and you get a a discount, so that the total would be about $10 for two shawarmas."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck shawarma! Pressed crispy and ready to go. We got the chicken shawarma for $5.20 (choices of chicken or beef). Huge deal going on: you get 2 for $7.50ish (customer appreciation deal!) line can be quite long because of the popularity its seen in the last year. I would recommend as a heavier snack between lunch and dinner #perfectportionsize"}
{"text":"I ordered their falafel wrap and it was delicious.  My friends ordered the shawarma plates and it looked amazing as well.  The price is right too."}
{"text":"Saw the 2 for $10 shawarma sign so I had to try since I love shawarma. I got chicken. Was not surprised that it was not as big as other places since the price was much lower. However, the veggies in the picture/menu did not match what I got. The picture has beets and no pickles. I love beets so I was excited to eat some, however upon eating my shawarma, there were no beets but pickles instead (I hate pickles). I think there was little to none hummus and garlic spread as well. A lot of onions. Overall, it was simply OK... I would rather spend $2-3 more to go elsewhere for a shawarma with more filling."}
{"text":"Best deal in town, 2 Shawarma's for $9.99. Quality and quantity is good and service is fast. A little less salt and this would be the perfect Shawarma! Restaurant has comfortable booth seating where you can check out a gourmet cooking show while you wait. Bring cash or debit card, credit cards are not accepted."}
{"text":"$10 for two shawarma wraps. Cheap but not worth. There were only 4 vegetables to choose from, no hummus, and only 2 sauces. The wrap (bread) itself was too hard and dry, almost like a taco shell (minus the crispiness). The inside of the wrap was so little compared to how big the wrap is, it felt like eating the bread most of the time. The meat was very hard as well..almost overcooked. The sauce was just off...did not go well with the flavour of the meat. Very unpleasant experience, will not go back again."}
{"text":"Tasty Shwarma indeed.   Ordered (from the all day special menu) 2 Chicken Shwarma Sandwiches at $8.25 and the Falafel Sandwich ($4.65?).  The shwarma comes with tomato, onions, peppers, pickles and choice of mild-hot or extra hot sauce.  Also on the all day menu is 2x: cheese burger, falafel, etc.  Great deal.  Friendly staff.  Clean facilities.   Cash or debit (with $.50 surcharge) only.   Depending on your order food may take up to 10 minutes.   Fresh pita and large serving."}
{"text":"Had shawarma sandwiches a few more times.   Delicious.  Beef or chicken, always made right. Extra spicy, extra pickles they accommodate what you ask for. Great flavours and worth the money.  Friendly staff, good people, good business."}
{"text":"A pound of food for less than 10 bux? For all the value seekers out there, this is a holy grail."}
{"text":"Bi got a mix plate and it was almost all rice, barely any meat.   Beef was disgustingly dry. I had a few pieces that was just all fat, quite chewy too. The interior is nice,  service is rushy, the food was not good so won't be returning."}
{"text":"A solid place to grab lunch. $5.30 for 1 shawarma, $9.50 for two plus tax.  I have eaten here several times and the quality is pretty good. Not the best that I've had in Toronto but good. The place isn't too big if you're looking to dine in."}
{"text":"Got to try this place after awhile of it being on my list.  Small place tucked away in a plaza on Markham Road, and although small, it's nice enough inside with tables for eating in. I got the falafel wrap and chicken shawarma wrap in a combo with wedges and a pop, for both it was under $20. The wraps were nice - wish I knew there were pickles hiding inside because I would have asked for them to be removed, but it wasn't a deal breaker. They were a touch on the dry side and a bit bland but ultimately they tasted nice and hit the spot. The wedges were actually really good, probably the highlight of the whole meal! I can see myself coming back for a lunch ...especially to have those wedges again!"}
{"text":"Title speaks for itself, I always get a $10 shawarma plate. Very tasty, very delicious and I always come with my husband. Great date place."}
{"text":"My 5 stars is specifically for the one order I always get - chicken shawarma plate, more salad, less rice, extra hot sauce, no turnips or pickles - it's always fresh, delicious & satisfying. I haven't tasted anything else here  so can't comment but the service is always friendly and they make it exactly how I want it. There is a tiny wait period but I'm more than happy to do so to get a hot fresh meal. It's become a regular place we go to when the hubster and I want to eat out :)"}
{"text":"Grab and go more than a sit down and eat spot. But if quality shawarma at an extremely affordable price are your thing then don't hesitate to give this place a try"}
{"text":"Tasty shawarma is T A S T Y. I've been going to Tasty Shawarma since before I could even Yelp (the original location in North York near Fairview mall). I was ecstatic when they opened up in richmond hill (off of Yonge near weldrick in the Sansotei plaza). If you're in the mood for some filling shawarma, or burgers this is the spot for you.   The restaurant is modern and has a really nice appearance. Food network will be playing on the TVs to help build an appetite while your food is being prepared.   I usually get takeout, but decided to dine in this time. I've tried basically everything on the menu and can attest to its freshness and taste. Decided on a beef shawarma plate this time, and it was spectacular! Very flavourful beef, and the rice is awesome too! You also get a salad or fries with your meal. I opted for salad. A basic salad but it's definitely fresh.   I have to mention the burgers again, what a great deal and soooo delicious. The value you get out of any meal here is great! Definitely a staple part of my food rotations."}
{"text":"This location used to be my favourite Tasty Shawarma location and also one of the best shawarma restaurants in the GTA. In the last year or so the quality of the food has gone downhill. Almost every time I order a chicken shawaram sandwich I find hard pieces of chicken and bones in my sandwich. Ive also had many instances where my sandwich just falls apart as I'm eating it. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because I remember the good old days when food was amazing and even cheaper. I cant recommend this place. Hopefully they get better and return to there old standards."}
{"text":"*Just wanted to add a note in response to the owners reply*  Unless you are at your restaurant 24/7 - which you are not, then you can't say portions haven't changed. That's YOUR STAFF! We USED to get take-out or dine in at least 2-3 times a month for about 3 years. I stand by my review 100%!! You are only focusing on one aspect of my review. Nope, still not going back. _________________________________________________________________ I've been back a few times since my last review. I wasn't going to post an update, but i haven't been happy for the last 3 visits.  I get that restaurants have costs & expenses, that's fine, every business does. Just as every person does when the cost of living goes up and salaries may or may not.  If i'm spending MORE of MY hard earned money on food and costs have gone up at a restaurant there are 2 things i find unacceptable #1 - don't try to cheap out and give me less food when i'm paying more! How insulting to customers! So i have to pay more and suddenly the quantity of rice, chicken & salad shrinks in the container?!? The last visit it was so obvious that i would say 1/4 of the food & salad was less, so much so that if the container had been in 4 sections, 1 whole section would've been empty! #2 Don't skimp & cheap out on quality! If costs go up, as a customer i'm assuming you are using the same quality not cheaper quality because then it wouldn't cost more, it should cost less. The way i see it, corners are being cut & prices are being raised thinking that customers are dumb. Just because people don't speak up all the time, it doesn't mean perfection. Most people can't be bothered anymore or don't care for such things. I was really disappointed at the soft cherry tomatoes, wilted lettuce and poorly made tabbouleh we ordered. I mean come on, half a container of tabbouleh for the same price, less tomato, bulgur etc?!? It's a shame because this was one of our fav places to have shawarma at. We've also been going there since they first opened. We only have 1 in Stouffville and well no comment on that one. Maybe i will try Paramount across the street. They always seem to be busy.   Buh bye Tasty Shawarma!"}
{"text":"$10 tax included for 2 shawarmas! Portions are big too, I always come with someone since one is definetly enough for me. I think the chicken tastes better than the beef, the beef can get a little dry.  Bang for Buck right here!"}
{"text":"A friend had got me take out from this place. He'd gotten me the shawarma plate with the chicken and beef. And boy was I happy.   The meat to veg ratio was great! I love the fact that they hadn't tried to cheap out on the meat.   Second the amount of veggies were amazing. I for one need veggies and this was great. What I would have to say is that there is A LOT of rice. But to be fair it was flavourful and quite yummy.  Overall I'd definitely recommend what I had. I'm not sure about the sandwiches but Id def be back to give it a try. The plate can easily feed two; but if you've got a monstrous appetite; you'd want to have it for yourself.   Also cannot comment on the restaurant itself as i've never been. But for the food alone; def worth take out."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you're craving for some Middle-Eastern sandwich. The portions are much bigger compared to other shawarma joints and the sauces they have are all homemade and fresh like no other.   One small drawback about this place is the rising costs of food they seem to implement every few months, I'm happy for their business but this may chase away a few customers.    Also, be sure to prepare for a bit of a wait as this place tends to be quite packed during meal times (which is obviously a good sign for the place's quality and popularity)"}
{"text":"I am no Shawarma expert but I can tell how a shawarma should look and taste like with my limited experience.  Tasty Shawarma's version is just nasty.   I think they have it all wrapped up like a taco pie on purpose so no one can see what they put inside, which is hardly anything. I know $10 for tax for 2 sounds cheap but you really get what you paid for.  I could only finished the Chicken one but just could not get myself to eat the Beef one because it was just so dry.  Skip the shawarma sandwich for sure. Maybe other options is better? But I won't be wasting my time and money to bet on that."}
{"text":"...the food appeared fine when I ate it yesterday...buy OMG last night and still currently I have the runs, High blood pressure, upset chest and feel like throwing up"}
{"text":"The food is simply phenomenal! The prices are reasonable and the quality definitely exceeded my expectations. How can you go wrong with 2 shwarmas for 10 dollars? The owner is friendly and is happy to accommodate any requests for spice, extra sauce, or substitutions.   Keep in mind that call in orders are only allowed for orders over 20 dollars. If you plan on stopping in around lunch, give yourself extra time as it typically takes between 10-15 minutes for your food to be prepared.   Trust me, you need to try it!"}
{"text":"Honestly worst shawarma place I've ever been too. !!!   The few times I've tried to place a order over the phone so I could pick it up on my break from work, I got SO much attitude from the guy who answered.  They are super slow and the food must be a joke.  They have been closed down more then 2 times for health violations... ew ...  If you're looking for something to eat you might as well just go to the subway beside it."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Cheap prices and tasty food. What more could you ask for? Just got 2 falafel for 6.75 which is awesome. A must go for sure"}
{"text":"So, after a lovely time at a hookah bar, I was very hungry and decided to give a try to their wrap shawa. Not bad. I went there at about 10:30 - 11 pm and had to wait 2-3 folks in line.   At the entrance the cook politely greeted. There were two kinds of meat, different in price. I bought both - a mixed wrap of beef and chicken. I paid with a credit card.  After getting paid for the order, the cook went on with his work. The gloves were on. Preparing my shawarma took no more than 5 minutes. The dish was served in a branded paper wrapper. Ingredients were fresh. Meat without cartilages or sinews, perfectly fried, the only downside is there was not enough sauce.   Luckily thanks to the lack of sauce, it did not fall apart, and was pretty lovely to eat. Overall, it's 4.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this location yesterday to have a bite around 4:30 pm. We usually come here for shawarma since it's the closest one to us from home. Instead of ordering once we got there, we decided to just call and place an order for pickup. We ordered 2 mixed shawarma sandwiches with extra sauce and one of them with extra turnips. We were about 20 mins away from Markham when the call was made. We assumed calling ahead of time would ensure our food was ready for pick up once we got there.  Once we got there, it was around 4:50 pm, and there seemed to be only 1 staff person working at the time and he looked like he was managing the front cash and the back. The entire time we were there (roughly 20 mins!) only 1 other person walked in so it wasn't overly busy, yet we waited so long to get our food.  We assumed the worst outcome and that it was very hectic before we came in. The minute we got our food, we paid $10.74 and head home.  Okay, here's where it gets worse. Before we started eating, I looked for the shawarma labelled extra turnips for myself and when I opened it and took the first bite, it was doused in a green hot sauce that set my mouth on fire. Okay we understand we said extra sauce but we didn't mean extra hot sauce, just the regular garlic and tahini sauce. This was an appetite killer because the more I ate, the hotter it got. I then realized there were no turnips in my sandwich either! My husband, who had just started eating as well, soon realized that he was eating my sandwich, even though my wrapper was the one indicating turnips.  We both swapped sandwiches but even the spice level was too much for him to handle and usually we can handle heat. With all these errors for 2 shawarmas, you'd think we would be able to let it go but there is more (smh). With only the few bites we had taken, our sandwiches were falling apart and seemed to be poorly made. Since everything was coming out, we noticed there was no chicken in our mixed shawarmas. NONE! There was beef but we asked for a mix on both. We could have shrugged that one off as well but it annoyed us that we asked for specific sandwiches where none of the criteria were met.  Without even bothering to take another bite, we wrapped up our food and went back to Tasty Shawarma. When we got there the time was around 5:45pm. There were more staff there then and we explained to them what happened. The girl in front explained to us that she could make us new sandwiches. We opted for that, but she was quick to state that they were out of chicken and it would take time. We were already tired and hangry at this point, and didn't seem like we were getting what we wanted. We asked for our cash back then and she said she was unable to refund us the money. At that time, a person in charge came forward and did refund us the cash we paid and apologized, which we know wasn't his fault but was kind on his part.  We left Tasty Shawarma with our money back, a bad taste in our mouths from all the spice, our time wasted and still hungry. We are now leaving a 1 star review just for the customer service we received. Overall, the food was lack luster and wasn't appetizing at all. We don't think we will waste our time coming here again in the future."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a good falafel,  and this place delivers. Ordered the combo with a side of hummus. Tasty,  fresh falafel and good but a little loose hummus. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"All day special: two shawerma for $10 ($8.85 + taxes) is a good deal. It used to be cheaper around $9 when it first opened.  They have giant shawerma spits spinning in the back; that's how you know its good meat. We normally get the chicken shawerma sandwiches or the dinner (which comes with rice, salad and meat).   During the last few visits, we noticed that they put less meat in the sandwiches which is disappointing. My hubby took two big bites out of his sandwich and unfortunately still didn't get to the meat. We keep coming back every time we crave shawerma sandwich as there's not other competition in the area.  Service is a bit slow during lunch rush. You may have to wait a while to pick up your food."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious chicken shawermas!!! Good for a quick drop in for a quick bite. Self serve  Chicken shawerma dinner is a good deal."}
{"text":"Went there with my dad's friends earlier this evening.  Just had their $5.98 beef with fries (since they didn't have tabooli) + pop combo.  The portions were large, I didn't even finish the fries (though they are the normal potato fries, so I wasn't too impressed with those now (not that they're bad, but it's passe for me).  They had $0.99 baklava which is good as well,  Though it was a bit over sweet for me so not good if you're watching your sugar levels.  I would go here again just because I want to try out their tabooli and hopefully they have it next time I go there.  And I did go again the next day in fact.  This time I had the $6.98 combo which included two shawarmas (I got one of beef and one of chicken). and I got the tabooli (which according to the owner uses extra virgin olive oil rather than trying to cut cost and using cheap vegtable oil).  This time I noted which toppings I got: * humus  * garlic sauce (I'll skip this next time, I'll explain below) * tzaziki sauce * lettuce * tomato * cabbage * onions (I may skip next time this because I don't normally like onions)  Now the reason I am skipping garlic sauce is because it is already in the tabooli.  The tabooli is ok alone, but it is kind of sour, but it complements the shawarma so one bite on the shawma and one bite of tabooli.  Maybe I can ask them to add some tabooli into the sharwma itself next time for an extra charge so I just eat it in one go."}
{"text":"I don't crush a lot of shawarma, but when I do, this is a top notch joint bursting with bold 'warma flavours and secret middle eastern spices, all at an affordable price. I almost always go for the chicken shawarma plate, at just under $10 it's great spread and will be sure to fuel you through the rest of the day. My colleague often enjoys a falafel sandwich. I don't partake in those myself, but they are made to order, which seems to be a hit! You'll pretty much be happy with anything you get except the cheeseburger and fries, not that I've ever tried them, but you gotta be checked out to order a burg at a shawarma joint. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time tonight. Inside is clean and presentable. I quickly ordered a shawarma wrap and grabbed a seat in one of the 8 booths.   Approximately 10 minutes later, the lady called my order and I grabbed my food.   Opening the shawarma wrap, I immediately realized this wasn't like the wraps I'm use to. It came in a different pita, they didn't ask me what I wanted on it .. but after the first bite, I didn't care much.   It tasted good.  It wasn't amazing or great, but it satisfied my hunger.   Would I return? Maybe if I am in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back"}
{"text":"The amount of meat in the shawarma has been continuously shrinking that it's practically a veggie wrap now."}
{"text":"Small menu selection but the food was really good, portion size of the shawarma plate and burger was worth the price. A few sides to choose from, potato wedges, rice, salad, tabouli or hummus. Shawarma plate was flavorful and very filling. Beef burger had a charbroiled taste to it, the patty was juicy and went well together with the cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. Wait time for food was longer than expected for a shawarma place but the nice seats and TVs made the wait much better.  Overall, will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"For the price you can't go wrong with this place. One of the best shawarmas in the Markham area. The two for 9 dollar shawarma is an amazing deal.   Tried the chicken shawarma plate. The plate was huge and is good for two people. The plate typically comes with salad which contained lettuce, tomatoes, onions and parsley. Some garlic sauce on top with rice. You can make a request for pita bread.   If you want \"healthy options\" here, they have grilled chicken breast plate. Just ask for no rice and garlic/tahini sauce (tho this really makes the meal).   Friend loved it here too! Comfortable seating and quiet place. They don't push you out at closing time, appreciated that fact.   Am I going there again?! You betcha.   Heard the falafel is awesome here too. Definitely want to try that the next time I go. They have decent cheeseburgers as well.   Can't wait to have my next meal here."}
{"text":"What to do...What to do...H'angry man!  It's New Year's Day.  Everything is closed.    It's almost 10PM and my early dinner has worn off.  Fridge is bare - as usual.  Sick of instant ramen.  Can opener is busted - darn you Dollarama!!! and where did I leave the Kitchen-Aid!!!    Maybe this is the universe telling me that I should lose weight for my NY resolution.  All I can say is Butt-Out-Universe!  It's too early in the NY for you to be suffocating me!  Let's drive up Yonge Street!  There is always something open on Yonge Street.  Hmmmm...pizza joint - closed, burger joint - closed!  Spotted a Mid-East place...open...didn't feel like it though.  Spotted another mid-east place...open...but I don't feel like it!  Spotted another mid-east place...hmmm...I think it's the universe butting in again and telling me that I'm going to have a wrap tonight!    Ugh...me and the universe are not aligned.  For all you astrologists out there - Please...no hate mail or advice!  The universe is already kick'n'm'butt!  Dropped into Tasty Shawarma.  I've been here before and it's an OK place.  There are probably a dozen other places in the area but I'm going where I am at - I'm a \"in the moment\" kind of guy - LOL.  The place is located in the strip mall a couple of lights north of 16th on Yonge.  It's a tiny store front so it can be missed or overtaken by ShishLix.  The place has plenty of seating and I do find it a bit dimly lit with dark walls but I'm here for the food.  My takeout was simple.  Chicken Shawarma wrap to go.  Food is fast and the service is prompt.  The wrap itself is a decent feed for $6 and it hits the spot.  It is well sized, even for a H'angy guy like me, and has good amount of chicken. Get the \"hot\" version - yum!  The place was still pretty busy so my chicken was pretty well off the spit.  I really dislike getting it fried or grilled because it came out of the fridge - really yuck.  The place has a simple formula.  Serve good quantity of food at a modest price.  This works for me when I'm looking for a fill up.  If you are looking for a \"Foodie Moment\" - this would not be for you.  In fact, skip the place as the owners would rather not have you run a one-star review on them.    Set your expectations clearly before going to any place.  That will probably be my NY Res!  Cheers."}
{"text":"Very bad shawarma sandwiches. Extremely dry. Not run by middle eastern people. The cashier was quite aggressive in handing me my money back, kind of hurt my hand. Very cheap but bad quality. They make the food in the back. You know something is shady when their shawarma meat and veggies aren't in the front, they make the food in the back. Did not even ask me what I wanted in my shawarma. Lettuce tasted wilted and gross."}
