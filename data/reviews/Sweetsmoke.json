{"text":"Located in a plaza in Oakville, I will admit that I was skeptical about Sweet Smoke. A great barbecue joint beside a Mr. Sub and Funky Thai 2 Go? In Oakville? Hmm.

Brightly lit and very clean, the interior looked newly renovated and ready for some hungry paddlers. We grabbed a table and were promptly given menus, which we scoured for the meatiest, tastiest sounding dishes. Paddling 20km during a 3 hour torrential downpour makes you hungry.

Sweet Smoke is both family-friendly and a good hang out, and the owner and the waitresses provided great service. After dinner, the owner was quite chatty and talked about how he slow cooked his pork and what he thought of his competition. It was a very relaxed atmosphere for a casual Saturday night dinner. They also serve homemade iced tea - sweetened, brewed tea which I found better than the bottled variety. 

Grilled Portobello Mushroom Melt
Arugula, Oven Dried Tomatoes, Grilled Red Onions, Gruyère Cheese, Guajillo Aioli on Toasted Rosemary Focaccia
A generous helping of portobello paired extremely well with the gruyère. This is the same cheese that Biff's used for their crepes, and I must say that I am a fan! Although I'm not usually a fan of cheesy sandwiches, gruyère pairs very well with meat and vegetables, this sandwich being no exception. I especially enjoyed the toasted focaccia bread. Warm, \"meaty\" with mushrooms, and toasty - this was my second favourite sandwich!

Southwestern Club
Hickory Smoked Turkey, Crispy Pancetta, Tomato, Greens, Avocado and Chipotle Mayonnaise on Ciabatta
We were surprised to receive this sandwich, because we only inquired about it but didn't actually order it (whoops). It didn't matter - we were so hungry that it was a welcome appearance so there was no need to complain or send it back. The smoked turkey was nice and juicy, the ciabatta was was buttered and grilled. I would have liked a bit more pancetta for additional flavour. Decent sandwich, but the mushroom melt definitely eclipsed this sandwich. Even though it was my least favourite sandwich of the night, it was still tasty!

El Cubano 
Pulled Pork, Shaved Smoked Turkey, Manchego Cheese and Quick Pickles on Sesame Seed Bun
Y-U-M! This was the best sandwich of the night. Smokey turkey, tender pulled pork, tangy sauce, and pickles was a great combination. Although it would probably be considered \"nontraditional\" for a pulled pork sandwich, I would have preferred it with the rosemary focaccia bread from the portobello mushroom melt and melted cheese. I liked the quick pickles quite a bit, I wouldn't mind ordering a side of them the next time I go in. The toasted sesame seed bun was soft & good, but wish it was a little more toasted - but the combination of the pulled pork and the turkey was heavenly so no complaints! Sammy win!

Flat Iron Steak Burrito 
Drunken Beans, Queso Fresco, Ancho Chile Salsa and Cilantro
Unable to find a great steak burrito in Toronto (tried Burrito Boyz, Burro Burrito, Big Fat Burrito and Burrito Loco) I felt like I was taking a chance ordering this. It came tender, juicy, and oh-so-delicious with melted cheese and great salsa. It was a good simple burrito, the meat was very well cooked - I wish it was jammed a bit more with veggies but considering that I wasn't at a burrito joint I can't expect to get a fat burrito. I wish there was a fast food burrito as tender as this...

Mixed Barbecue Sampler
Hickory Smoked BBQ Ribs, Slow Smoked Pulled Pork, Cowboy Beans, and Jicama slaw
I came for the pulled pork, but when I spotted an item that gave you pulled pork and ribs, I was sold! The pulled pork was great - tender, juicy, smokey, and full of flavour. Everything I look for in pulled pork. While some might be turned off by the orange-coloured sauce, I happened to love the citrus flavour. If I could tweak one little thing, it would be the hickory flavour - more please!
The ribs however, were a little on the dry side but they still had a nice smokey flavour that I enjoyed. They weren't too dry, but I've had better.
The beans were tasty and saucy but the slaw was just slaw - I later learned that many people top their sandwiches with the slaw. I would've tried it if it occurred to me!

Cake and Shake!
Blackout Cake with Dark Chocolate Pudding, and Vanilla Bean Milkshake
The chocolate fiend in me was definitely satisfied with this rich, moist cake. Creamy chocolate mousse layers nestled between dense cake was a great way to end the meal. If you like frothy and richly-flavoured milk shakes, you will love this. Mmm...

If you're looking for a savoury sandwich, Oakville's Sweet Smoke Barbecue & Grill is worth a visit! Friendly service (although we did accidentally get a sandwich that we didn't order), warm meaty sandwiches, and a bright interior made this a great place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Just bad BBQ!

Service was acceptable, and the atmosphere feels like a dark fast food joint.

I have judged at the American Royal competition in Kansas City, so I am a little harsh with sub par barbecue. 

I had the tortilla soup and the bbq sampler. The soup was good, though not hot (temperature) enough. It just tasted like taco seasoning, but it was still decent and the best thing we ate all night. 

Now the bad part, the main course. The coleslaw was runny and overdressed. The beans were tough. The turkey was way too wet, like it was brined for far too long. The pulled pork was also very very wet with a mushy texture. The ribs were over cooked and bland. They had no flavour from a rub or sauce. There was amost no perceptable smoke flavour in any of the meats. 

The bbq sauce that was on the plate was also runny and tasteless. There was no bottles of sauce on the tables. 

We didn't bother with dessert.  After that bland, watery meal, leaving was the only thing on our minds.

This place is not worth going to even once as there are other far superior barbecue restaurants 30-60 minutes away"}
{"text":"I love this local joint.  Whether I get take out or eat in the food is always great.  A few of my favorites are the Sweetsmoke Cobb Salad, the Portabello Mushroom Melt, and El Cubano sandwich.  You can't go wrong with a side of their delicious Mac & Cheese either."}
{"text":"I never would have found this place if it weren't for Yelp (and a GPS).  I've recently been on a pulled pork diet (i.e. I only eat pulled pork) so I thought I would try a place in my neck of the woods.

I had an appointment that evening so I had to squeeze in a quick dinner between work and the appointment.  Sweetsmoke was completely empty when we walked in around 5:30p.m.  I guess nobody eats at 5:30.

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the mac & cheese.  My sandwich was so juicy it was actually difficult to eat.  After the first bite I couldn't put it down.  Not because I couldn't get enough, but because a pool of liquid quickly formed on my plate (from the sandwich) and I had nowhere to put it down.  The meat was very tasty at the beginning, when the juices were pouring out, but actually tasted a little bland near the end, once the leaking had stopped.  

I had a similar issue with the mac & cheese.  For some reason it was really runny, kind of watery.  It was just average in flavour, could have used a thicker, cheesier sauce or some interesting spices.

I tried some of the tortilla soup and that was fantastic.  I would definitely order that for myself next time.

I also ordered a coke to drink and it came in a 500mL plastic bottle with a glass of ice.  I'm rather particular about my coca-cola and prefer when it's served in a glass bottle or a can.  I'll even take coke from a fountain over coke from a plastic bottle.  Call me Picky.  I'll have to remember to choose a different beverage next time.

I noticed some cute desserts in their display case at the counter, but I forgot to save room.

I had to wash my hands after that mess of a sandwich and must admit their washrooms are great.  Memorable details include a Pottery Barn reed diffuser.  I don't know why I notice random things like that."}
{"text":"Odd things are often found in odd locations.  Sweetsmoke is an example of this located in a strip small that straddles the border of Oakville and Burlington.  The environment is somewhat sterile but they make a good attempt at trying to perfect American bbq.  I enjoyed the ribs while my son devoured their pulled pork.  I found that they successfully removed the grease that is often found in ill-prepared ribs while imparting a slight smoky/sweetness applied from both the bbq sauce and the cooking technique.  I preferred the beans the way they prepared them (al dente) but can understand why not everyone would.
        The oddest thing about this place is the way the meals were organized.  My son ordered a pulled pork sandwich (which was huge) but there was absolutely no side that came with it.  Yet at the same time, my slab of ribs came with the kettle beans and the overdressed cole slaw.  I can't quite figure out the logic but it was yummy nonetheless.  He was delighted that nothing came with the sandwich so that he could partake of the many in-house (made daily) desserts that they had at their counter.
        They certainly try hard but just fall short."}
{"text":"We were here in the beginning of February we heard about it from groupon. The food was excellent, the pulled pork was juicy and the tortilla soup was amazing."}
{"text":"I love the food at this place, I've been coming here for years.  Desserts are made by an actual trained pastry chef too.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's extremely expensive for what it is.  $5 for the small sized mac & cheese always bugs me, yet I order it because I like it as a side with my pulled pork sandwich.  Pulled pork is excellent, some days I get it topped with coleslaw and some days just lots of their orange infused barbeque sauce.  All I can say is you're crazy not to try it if you're ever in the area..  I travel out of the way any time I'm even remotely in the area to grab some take-out.  Recommendations: Pulled pork sandwich (optionally topped with slaw), Cuban sandwich, Shaved Turkey club w/avocado, mac & cheese, any of the desserts.

Did not care for their ribs, however.  Weren't trimmed to my liking, too many inedible parts of bone/cartlidge/fat for the money.  Baby backs would have been more suitable for the price."}
{"text":"If you are looking for very average BBQ, this place may be for you. It took 45 minutes to get out mains on a Thursday night (and there were only 12 other diners in the place) and we did not order any appetizers. Ribs were overcooked and dry, beans were hard, slaw was overly moist. Sauce was average with little smoke or bite. Pulled pork was their only saving grace. Waitress seemed preoccupied with takeout orders."}
