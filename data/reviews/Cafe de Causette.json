{"text":"Very cute cafe. Ambience is very nice and comfortable. A bit on the dimmer side, which makes reading a paper book not difficult, but no issues with electronics :)

I ordered the green tea waffle with sesame Ice cream and it was amazing. Not too sweet, but they also offer extra icing sugar if you need more sugar! 

I also ordered the roasted salmon panini which was made fresh, so there was a wait time. It also comes with a salad which was freshly made and cut ! Will definitely be back.

They also have presotea at this location if you need a bubble tea fix."}
{"text":"The bubble tea was great. Had coconut. The place is nice to sit in and do some work. The problem was there an intense smell of frying food in the place so when you leave you will reek of fried food."}
{"text":"Came here on a lazy Sunday afternoon around 3 pm. I like the relaxed lounge vibe it gives off here. Its spacious. Theres about 7-8 tables plus a sofa and coffee table to the side. Great place to hangout with friends to catch up, curl up with a book or work on your laptop. 
We ordered two afternoon tea sets: ($5-8)
1) Deep fried Taiwanese sausage and popcorn chicken + cup of coffee 
2) Nutella crepe + cafe latte

3) We also ordered a mango slush from the Presotea menu.

Food is ok. But I like the fact that it's chill here and best part is you could order a decent latte or bubble tea at one stop.
Fyi- there's minimal service here. They give you menus but you have to go up to counter to order. Food is brought to you but drinks need to be picked up at the bar.
Next time I look forward to trying their lunch set menus: salad+ sandwich+ drink"}
{"text":"2 stars and a half! We ordered a nutella crepe and a berry waffle for 3. The crepe and waffle were good but I didn't like the ice cream they used. It tasted \"cheap\", almost the no name brand. But I really liked the waffle with berries. I felt that the waffle had a hint of black sesame taste and I liked that a lot. But my friends said they couldn't  taste it. So, I'm not too sure what to say about that. Haha Overall, it was ok."}
{"text":"Seems like a pleasant place for snack and dessert. They have a variety of drinks, snacks and desserts. I feel relax sitting there. It's quiet with free wifi. You can also work or study there if you want to have a change of environment."}
{"text":"A very good place to sit and  do some work. Amazing selection of bubble teas and desserts."}
{"text":"Owner is very nice! The boba and waffle was also very good but I do prefer the chocolate temptation over the taste of japan"}
{"text":"Overall - 2.5/5.0

An update to my previous reviews after coming back here for several occasions.

*Update #2* Got the brick toast again and this time around it was under toasted and the bread itself was very dry. Totally different experience from what I had the first time. Looks like the quality is not consistent and may depend on who is making it at the time. I do hope that the staff is provided with proper instructions and training on how to make these things consistently. And if they are, then whoever made it is definitely not paying attention to the details.

Drinks could be a little bit more consistent as well. I usually order the passion fruit like with basil seeds. Each time it was somewhat different in terms of flavour and the amount of toppings. Taste wise it is still enjoyable.

On a more positive note, it's a cozy little place to sit and relax. You can bring board games etc. They also have decks of cards, uno etc available."}
{"text":"Hmmm, I was kind of excited to come here, as the combination of things they offered was quite unique. Was a bit of a letdown, but overall just okay. Had a hard time deciding a star rating, so I'm gonna go with 2.5 stars. 

The seats and tables were quite neat. Everything gave off a bit of a rustic feel, which was quite a nice touch. The overall decor was cool with all the windows, but the bright bar area where you ordered threw everything off. 

With that in mind, you are supposed order on your own at the bar area... Yet they have seats for you to relax and sit at. Seemed a bit odd, especially with them bringing you your food and cleaning dishes after you. They may as well just provide a server service and get tips!


The PresoTea was not all that great here though. I have definitely had better, and was REALLY surprised (and a little upset) that they didn't have my go-to green apple. Ended up with Passion Fruit Green Tea, which was just meh. 
The waffle was quite nice, decided to go for the Berry Waffle, but they ran out of Strawberry Ice Cream. Substituted Mango Ice Cream, so it was alright, but it was odd they didn't have another tub in the back or something. Overall the waffle was okay, but nothing amazing. 

A nice place to go I guess, but nothing that other locations in the close vicinity doesn't also have. Don't know if I'll be back to try their sandwiches...?"}
{"text":"Loving this place! Really cozy and quiet. Excellent place to do some studying or work or if you just want to chill. Currently they have coupons for $8 for panini and coffee or tea. I had the roast beef panini. It was really good. Perfect for a snack. I had a earl grey crema tea which to me was amazing! I love earl Greg and it was the perfect sweetness and saltiness. There waffles and crepes look great! A definite must try!"}
{"text":"I haven't been in this plaza in a very long time so I didn't even know this place existed. 
It's a fusion of Taiwanese tea shop with similar snacks yet they offer cafe sandwiches and salads oh and ice creams. I bit confusing. 

While by brain tries to process what kind of restaurant/cafe this is, I'll just let my tummy review what it's just digested. 

The tea/shake
I had the avocado milkshake, usually can't go wrong right. Wrong. It tasted like milk vanilla and maybe a little and I stress the word little taste of avocado. 
My date had the roasted milk tea less ice lite sugar. 
That wasn't bad. Had a good tea flavour. There are other places that can do better, but ok none the less. 

The snacks
2 of 3 stars!
We ordered the Taiwanese BBQ sausage and the Taiwanese crispy chicken nugget bits.
Awesome! A lot of BBT places serve these quite oily, but the ones we received were not only flavourful but not too oily. 

The last star belongs to the service. The servers were all very pleasant and quite bilingual. 

If anything I'd come back for the snacks."}
{"text":"First time here. The menu is huge and has a variety of items from sandwiches to waffles to bubble teas etc. I asked for the passion fruit green tea (their most popular bubble tea that does not contain milk). It was really good. They have an offer buy 2 for $8 which is sweet (yes pun intended).

Very comfy seats. Minimum noise. Free Wi-Fi. Great for getting work done. Check it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I'm hesitant giving this place a good review, because it'll become too busy :P

They currently have a 2 drinks for $8.00 special going on - refer to my Tip with the pic for the particular drinks. My friend and I wanted this deal, and they were nice enough to let us pay separately. The bbt they serve is Presotea.

I got the Panda Milk Tea - gimmicky regular milk tea w/ black and white tapioca pearls. I've had Presotea before but this time the milk tea tasted very bland - hopefully just a one off.

The one thing I liked about this place was the comfy chairs, which facilitated a chill ambience which allowed for optimal chilling.

I'll def be back to chill and try their waffles/desserts."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place for bubble tea. (I cannot attest to the other foodstuffs bc when though we went like 10 times thru the course of 3 days, we just got bubble tea lol) 
The layout is sleek and modern. Yess

They have a 2 for $8 special with 3 choices:
   Panda milk tea (black milk tea with white/black
      bubbles)
   Passion fruit green tea
   Mango slush 

Also, if u get their reward card you can get deals for free medium small large bubble tea drinks!
I got 65 panda milk tea no sugar warm like 10 times... It was so amazing 
By the 2nd time we went the owners knew us haha 
Also, this place is really good for studying (in the mornings to lunchtime, nighttime it gets super loud) their chairs are really comfy and the lighting is natural 

Chatime messed up once and that's all it took for me to just go to this place for all my bubble tea in Toronto"}
{"text":"love the food and drinks at this place, you get huge portions especially if you order the waffles! The employees are always friendly, love coming here when I need me time or working time"}
{"text":"Hubby and I were in the area to try another restaurant and decided to have dessert here first. The cafe was surprisingly not busy for a Saturday night. Even better, the Raptors game was playing on their flatscreen tv so we could enjoy dessert while watching the game. The ambiance is polished yet comfortable, with distressed wood tables, super comfy single seat armchairs, and nice light fixtures.

The smell of waffles and crepes in this cafe is intoxicating. We ordered the Taste of Japan which includes a waffle, green tea ice cream, red bean, honey, and whipped cream. They have half portions for $6.99, or full portions (2waffles) for $9.79. The waffle itself was crispy and lightly sweetened. The green tea ice cream, red bean, and tapioca balls were nice textural and flavour accompaniments to the waffle. I'm not sure that the addition of honey is necessary as the other elements make this dish sweet enough.

They sell Presotea bubble tea, so this is a great place to hang out with friends while enjoying Taiwanese snacks, sandwiches, dessert, and drinks. I plan to try their earl grey waffle next time I'm here.

{"text":"I came here the first time sunday afternoon for a light lunch. I ordered the tuna and mayo brick toast for $4.99 and the hot passionfruit grapefruit green tea for $3.99. They were both yummy. The toast came out fresh and hot. My friend got the roast beef sandwich and she also liked it. The atmosphere was nice and it was quite comfortable. We were the only ones there so food and drinks came out fast. They bring you the food, but you go and get your drink. The drinks are from presto tea. They combined the cafe and the bubble tea shop. I saw people eating their ice cream and waffles and it smelled so good. I'm probably gonna try that next time."}
{"text":"Came here to just chit chat and kill some time. I ordered a Presto Strawberry Calpis and shared a half Taste of Japan Waffles (Matcha Ice Cream, Red Bean & Mini Mochi Pieces) with some friends. 

Waffles were made to order so they were super crispy outside. The red bean n mochi were cooked to the right consistency. But wish they sprinkled a few more mochi in. 

My strawberry Calpis was to my liking. Not too sweet not too watery, it was just right for me. :)"}
{"text":"Got the passion fruit lime with aloe vera and basil seeds, and the mango float. Both were amazing! This place has nice seats and cards/games to play. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Drinks are good but service can be slow. Got the first thing that was listed on the menu. Mango pineapple slush. It tasted a little sweet and a little sour but mostly sweet. Its a perfect drink and a warm spring day. I love the decor of this place. They definitely did not cheap out on the furniture. The table is an Eleanor adjustable bar table. I liked it so much I had to look it up. The cheapest one I could find online was around $700. I really want this table.

Anyway, this is a great place to quench your thirst."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about prestotea, and was curious about their panda bubbles. 
The cafe itself seems like a chill area to hang out with friends.
I ordered the panda milk tea. The tea was pretty good, but don't expect white bubbles as illustrated in their photos! Rather the white ones are more translucent in appearance. 

As I was walking back to work, I happened to chew on something thin and hard. Initially I thought it may be the plastic wrapping from the lid. As I spat it out, I realized it was a strand of hair. My hair was tied back, and this strand of hair was somewhat embedded in the tapioca. I called to inform them, and they stated that I could trade it for a new one. After some reflection, I think I'll pass."}
{"text":"Love the ambience here. Very casual with big comfy chairs and nice looking wood tables. Great for working or a few card games with friends here. There are quite a few bbt stores in this specific plaza so there's always guaranteed a table. The place and washroom is clean whenever I come so I guess they've maintained it well. 

They serve a good variety of desserts and looks pretty good but probably not the best place for amazing quality dessert. The drinks they serve are presotea which I am in love with, but not the best location I've had presotea at. The variety and amount of different drinks they have is also pretty impressive. Service is also friendly."}
{"text":"I looked forward to a waffles fix and was not let down! This location used to have Wanda's Belgian waffles which aren't available anymore but the waffles are still good! I tried the green tea signature waffle and although there was a wait for the waffle to be made fresh, I was delighted to bite into the warm and sweet goodness. The lady who served me was also super nice and I really appreciated her coming over to ask how everything was as the place is more of a self-serve concept. I look forward to trying other flavours of waffles next time and maybe complimented with ice cream!The cafe offers a nice place to study or simply catch up with friends. The armchairs were quite comfy. They also serve sandwiches, Presotea bubble tea along with other hot drinks which is nice! I'm not sure when this will end but there is also currently a promotion to buy any 1 regular drink and get 1 of the 3 regular specified drink for free which is a steal! Excited that this location is back in business and will definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"This place used to be 'Wanda's Waffles'. The new cafe now serves crepes, waffles, sandwiches, coffee and bubble tea (franchised with Presotea).

I've been to this place couple times now. I like the cosy ambiance and big arm chairs, super friendly service and freshly made food. I feel like supporting this friendly place by posting my very first comment on Yelp!!

Today I ordered a passion fruit tea with aloe vera and basil, and chicken nuggets (Taiwanese style). The owner also recommended a Sweet & Salty waffle (bacon, potato salad and maple syrup). This is a very generous portion so I shared with my friend and we all loved it! Just a heads up tho that the waffles they served are 'Brussels Belgium waffle' which is light and crisp, unlike 'Liege' waffle which is thicker similar to bread dough, as was served by the previous owner. 

As mentioned all food was freshly made so it's a bit of wait but reasonable. While I was waiting I enjoyed their free Wifi and MTV that they played on a big flat screen TV.

Overall good service and good food. I will definitely come back!!!h"}
{"text":"I loved this place! The ambience, food, and servers were great! It was pretty empty when u came at around noon - you could easily find a spot. I got their \"best sandwich\" on wheat bread which had \"Bacon, Egg Salad, Sweet Corn, Tomato, Lettuce, Garlic Mayo\" and an iced coffee. Both items were delicious, especially the sandwich! So packed with flavour and very filling. The only downside I found was the seating - a bit uncomfortable to sit if you plan on staying for a long time and there was limited plugs around the restaurant. Would recommend this place and the best sandwich if you decide to come here!"}
{"text":"I love preso tea, their tea base is great, never taste overly chemical or sweet. This location is the same, they are a bit slow at going through the orders, and they dont call you when your order is ready (they just put your drink or food in the counter), but the quality of the teas are fantastic."}
{"text":"We ordered a savoury Hawaiian crepe (ham, pineapples, cheese, greens) and a Taste of Japan full waffle (green tea ice cream, red beans, honey). Although I've had better savoury crepes, the food was overall still tasty and filling.

The ambience of the cafe is what really made this place stand out to me. It was a relaxing environment and also had card games at the counter. 

This is the perfect spot to chill with friends! I will be back :)"}
{"text":"I dropped by here for some desserts with my friend. The place had a fairly boring atmosphere. Even the workers seemed to be bored. I ordered a an ice cream floaf but was just given a milkshake which was a bit of a disappointment."}
{"text":"Café de Causette is a good spot to chill and study during the day as it's not too busy. The interior is bright and spacious with comfortable seating. They have a decent selection of food and desserts and of course the bubble tea from the Presotea menu! Visited on a Saturday night with a friend and it was quite busy. We ordered the half portions of the taste of Japan waffle and the earl grey waffle. The earl grey waffle smelled really good but the flavour was lacking, a bit too subtle for my liking. The taste of Japan waffle was alright nothing special, plain waffle topped with red bean mochi and green tea ice cream. I do recommend ordering the full portions if you can, more worth it for the price. 
  
They also have some card games at the counter!"}
{"text":"Cafe De Causette is the one of the four Taiwanese tea place inside Commerce Gate. 

Grand Opening Special: Buy one get one free regular drink is a good deal not to be missed as you are really paying $5+tax for 2 drinks. Regular is perfect size to fulfill my BBT cravings!

I love the seating here the sofa area is quite comfy but on a cold day the whole place does feel really drifty especially by the windows. By setting up the heat a little higher might help, and I did have my winter jacket the whole time I was there.

Cafe de Causette does serves Panini/Sandwich and Waffles. How can I resist freshly made waffles?

Taste of Japan ($8.95) has a good waffle based but a little lack of toppings. A small scoop of green tea ice cream and a spoonful of red bean was a little sad. Why was the waffle served in a takeout box with plastic cultery? But the lady was nice enough to bring me a 'real' plate so I could enjoy my treat.

A lot of potential and quite promising for this nice little cafe."}
{"text":"The Signature Waffle was okay for $5.  The 2 pieces of waffle were big and thick.  It was too bad that they were a little chewy.  The green tea flavour should be called green tea colour, as the flavour was just a hint even when I actively searched for it.

Presotea was as good as always.  We took advantage of a 2 large Presotea for $8 special.  We were quite happy with the value as a result.  I am not sure we would pay full price ($5) for each drink next time, however."}
{"text":"Came here to check it out.  Had the earl grey tea waffle and green tea latte. I like that both aren't sweet and the waffle is soft.

My niece had the marshmallow and Nutella brick toast and a mango n pineapple slush. The brick toast was skimpy on the Nutella and the slush was watered down. 

I might come back to try the meals here.  Service is slow and they burnt the toast the 1st time so we had to wait another 10 mins to  have a new one made."}
{"text":"Located in the plaza with millions of other bubble tea places, this cafe is a cute, sit-in addition to the plaza. If you're looking for somewhere to study and have some desserts, Asian cafe food, or bubble tea, this place is great for that. 

The decor is very nice and rustic, they definitely didn't cheap out. I don't recommend super large groups (6+) especially during peak times because there's a chance they won't be able to accommodate the group and the place is not really made for that. Service was very friendly. It's more of an order at the desk, go sit, and they'll bring it to you system which is sort of odd, but no complaints here. 

We ordered the earl grey waffle, taste of Japan waffle, smores waffle, a crepe, and the spring roll. As expected, the spring roll is subpar. Didn't get my hopes up there. The waffles were quite good. I very much liked my earl grey one. It was subtle, but the flavour was delicious. The portion sizes are quite large so my friends couldn't finish some of it, so if you're not that hungry, order the half portion, not the full one. 

We did not get a chance to order bubble tea, but we saw the 2 for $8 deal and I will definitely be trying that. I don't go out for desserts much, but if I am craving it, this place is definitely on my list."}
