{"text":"I've never had a Sonoran hot dog before but this won't be my last. Absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"I am from Tucson and these hot dogs definitely give the Tucson dogs a run for their money. These dogs are seriously delicious! The buns are super soft and tasty, five stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Very nice staff and open late on weekends. Just went for the first time and will be back. Get the sonoran just the way it comes."}
{"text":"great hot dogs for a good price. real mexican authentic taste. it just smells delicious. in a nut shell this is bacon wrapped mexican goodness."}
{"text":"So good. You can get what you want or fully loaded and they are delicious either way. Tons of side toppings to make them even better."}
{"text":"Unbelievable Sonoran dogs! Price and service are great! Have to love the old school Mexican Coca-Cola bottles!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for a late night snack (10pm-still on eastern time). Was going to get it to go but the weather was so amazing, that sitting under the canopy to enjoy the night air was irresistible. The place is basically a (fancy) hot dog cart under a (nice) tent with folding tables (covered in tailored red vinyl table clothes) and chairs; loved the local vibe. my dogs came with everything (con todo) and I have to say, it was the tastiest mess I have ever struggled with, you will need a fork to finish your meal. The Sonora dog con todo was a unique blend of seemingly unrelated flavors that met up to fiesta in your mouth. If your in Phoenix, coming to this funky spot is a must!"}
{"text":"The hot dogs are pretty good, however they never open even close to on time. I would recommend going after 7:30."}
{"text":"Wow great Sonoran dogs and apple soda. Love it. Don't be afraid to stop and eat the staff is very friendly and the service is good."}
{"text":"Excellent Sonoran dogs & street food. This local gem is a must. We love bringing out of towners. You can add a bunch of toppings also. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is legit.  Real deal Sonoran dogs!  You can find Sonoran dogs all across the valley, but what makes this place stand out is the quality of ingredients and their \"buns\" that they have.  No regular hot dog bun will work, you have to use real buns like they do in Tucson and in the Sonoran area.  The buns are fluffy and have a sweetness about them.  They are perfect for the saltiness of the hot dog and bacon.  You can put a lot of various toppings on it as well.  They have chips and sodas as well.  The prices are really affordable and plenty of seating.  They usually set up shop later in the evening and is open pretty late.  If you are looking for a late night meal or snack, I definitely would give this place a try.  Great food, moderately price, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Forget about the rest and come try the best!!  This place is authentic. Sonoran hot dogs served fresh under a tent. Cold Mexican coke in the half liter bottle. My family and I head here whenever the craving strikes. The workers are always friendly, fast, and pleasant.  The food is great. The rolls are always fresh. The toppings are delicious and the grilled chilies are so good. There is a extra toppings bar with different sauces and a few special items to compliment your meal. Highly recommended..."}
{"text":"Love this Sonoran hot dog stand. I've eaten here multiple times and I've never had any sort of problem. Yes, the hours are flexible and don't always match what's listed on Yelp (specifically the opening time), but it's a damn hot dog stand, not a freakin Olive Garden! Get over it. Be careful when parking"}
{"text":"These are the best Sonoran Hot Dogs in all of Arizona. The very best. Hands down. Without question. I should know. I am a Sonoran Hot Dog expert.  My credentials as an expert are as follows.   I lived in Tucson for several years. I consider Tucson the Mecca of Sonoran Hot Dogs, at least within the confines of our great state of Arizona.  I'm not sure street vendors in Mexico could beat Lupita's, but my claim here is that these are the best in AZ. The Sonoran Hot Dog is essentially the signature munch of Tucson and I've eaten them all over the Old Pueblo.  I was addicted to them. There is a rich history in Tucson surrounding El Guero Canelo and it's nearby competitors. It's sad that Tucson, with its tradition regarding these dogs, cannot say it hosts the best Sonoran Hot Dog in the state, but they don't. Sorry Tucson.   Yes, I know El Guero Canelo (EGC) opened up in Phoenix. I was thrilled. I was there opening day. These are better. The condiment bar is not as extensive as EGC but I don't go for the free toppings. These dogs don't need toppings.   The bun is amazing. Sweet, soft and perfectly toasted. The bacon wrapped dog is grilled perfectly. They stuff these babies generously with tasty beans, onions, tomato, cheeses, mayo, etc. The word delicious is insufficient to describe them.   I am not the only one on Yelp to say these are the best in AZ. Perhaps I am not the only expert in the State. In any event, these are the best. Order two with everything and get an Orange Fanta."}
{"text":"My brother and I just went to this place tonight to grab a quick dinner. I checked them out online to glean some info, and the reviews were all positive, commending the place for their great customer service and food. I am writing this review to affirm that and to recommend everybody to give this place a shot.   It is a family owned business and you can tell it is a well-managed one by the friendly customer service and the swiftness of the food being cooked and served.   Their Sonoran Hot Dogs are composed of hot dog, bacon, tomato, sour cream, a side of cooked Habanero, and a lightly buttered hot dog bun. The balance of the ingredients is in a  perfect unison of meat, vegetables and a light sauce delivering an ecstasy of bliss and flavor to your taste buds. The mouth savoring experience will have you craving for more, and this place is, indubitably, one of the best in Phoenix, and could rival those of the best in Tucson as well.   They have a plethora of condiments and add-ons for the hot dogs, such as raw onions, pickles, sliced mushrooms and much more.   The customer service was superior from taking my order to being promptly served my meal as soon as it was finished.   If you are a lover of hot dogs, especially well-made ones, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Lupitas is open sunset to approx 12 AM or later on weekends.  This basically a fully loaded sonoran hot dog only type place and they do it right.  $3/dog and plenty of extra toppings to load it up.  Service is prompt and attentive and hot dogs are on point.  Highly recommend for your Sonoran dog fix or first experience!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Food is excellent. Had the hot dogs with EVERYTHING on it and they don't make it too spicy but they have a small \"salsa\" bar - the green sauce is delish. They also have many Mexican sodas to choose from and if you want an extra snack, have their tostilocos or duros."}
{"text":"Ah Lupita's. I was in love with Nogales hot dog stand, but now I have you.   This place is great! We decided to come check this place out after a movie and it hit the spot. Two bacon wrapped hotdogs with everything and a sangria and I am ready for a nap! The staff are all sweet and helpful. Very clean and lots of condiments to add to whatever you order. I will definitely  be coming back and will also be bringing the fam and friends. It's a family run business and you shouldn't pass it up!"}
{"text":"LITERALLY THE BEST HOT DOGS I'VE HAD IN MY LIFE.  Parking is a pain in my $*# but once you bit into the thing all of your life's worries slowly melt away into your mouth. Get it with everything on it. They're pretty big but being 6'3 220 pounds I order two or three. The prices seem to change all the time but I really don't care. This place cooked up the best dogs I've ever had.  They have a tent and tables set up if you want to eat there. I suggest just taking it home and cracking open a beer. I've been here 12 times in the last 2 months."}
{"text":"MUY BUENO!! Don't pass up this spot just because it's in a tent! If you love Sonoran Hotdogs, this is the BEST place to get one in North Phoenix!  Growing up on the border of Arizona & Sonora, Mexico, the Sonoran hotdog was 1 food we couldn't find in the valley for almost 20 yrs. Our son & his wife found this place when Lupita's was just Lupita with a hotdog cart. You can get it your way, with several options, i.e., with/without beans, type of salsa,  onions tomatoes, etc. The sodas are served ice cold in glass bottles.  The place is open for dinner & stays open for the hungry bar crowd & her hours change with the seasons.  If you're hungry & in the area, perhaps wanting to eat before going to the movie at the Harkins around the corner,  Lupita's is on 32nd Street, on the west side of the street, just south of Bell. There is a parking lot. Don't pass just because it's in tent. You won't be sorry! !"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! I literally drove out from LA just to eat some of these hotdogs! Such a hidden gem, the best hot dogs I've ever had."}
{"text":"Delicious and very inexpensive... I had personally never had a Sonoran hotdog before but my girlfriend loves them so I figured I would give one a try. We Yelped this place and I cant imagine popping my Sonoran Cherry at a better place. The bun was perfect the hotdog bacon wrapped, and all of the toppings distributed perfectly so they remained on the dog and didnt just end up all over the plate. They of course have bottled mexican soda, but it is in a king size bottle rather than your standard 12 oz. I went yesterday, and plan on going back this evening. 2 dogs and 2 cokes for $11."}
{"text":"Best Sonoran hot dogs on this side of town!! I was so obsessed with them that I would have them every weekend!  While away in Europe for 2 months this is the only thing thing I craved from here the states. They are opened until 2 am on weekends and they are amazing!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican hit they are very authentic to our culture ,they are just super delicious and great pricing"}
{"text":"Best Sonora hot dogs ever. Whether you go at 6pm when they open or 2am right at close, you can expect a deliciously fresh cooked hotdog. The flavors are delicious and they put just enough of everything together to where it's not soggy nor too much. Soooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent value the Sonoran dogs are fantastic with a bun that is unbelievably good and they really have a good condiment selection.  My wife and I will be returning ."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs and they serve real coke in the bottle. Perfect for the late night quick fix when you don't want to hit up the average mill of the run fast food joint. Servers are on point too and curious."}
{"text":"Service is great right when you get there....  Plenty of condiments to choose from, especially if you love spice.   I searched for food nearby and saw the photos here on Yelp and was definitely impressed.   Stopped by and was catered too right from the start... Authentic Mexican Cokes that have that flavorful real Coke taste...  different from can.  The food is amazing! Definitely will be coming back to get more food. Had to get seconds."}
{"text":"Great Sonoran hot dogs! I've never actually had them before but now I love them! Service was fast and it was a unique environment!"}
{"text":"Really tasty old school Sonoran hot dog cart!  Friendly ladies show lots of pride in their business.  More diverse crowd than I was expecting.  Will return for sure."}
{"text":"Best Sonoran hotdog hands down! Met the owner, Lupita, and she's as nice as they come! You can tell the pride all the employees take in their job. I felt like it was more than a hotdog, it was a reflection of each one them. Great Place!!!! We'll be back!   PS. Don't miss out on the fantastic hot cocoa!"}
{"text":"My favorite hotdog stand in Phienix. The hotdog buns are steamed and grilled. The dog to die for. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Some pretty awesome dogs, too many toppings to count. Only downside is trying to find a place to park. I'll definitely be back though!"}
{"text":"This place has the best hot dogs I've ever eaten in my life, Sonoran or otherwise. And I love a good hot dog! Great service and great price. It's a hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"Amazing dogs!!!!!!!!!!! Great quality and portions!!!!! Must stop and will always come here when in the hood!!!"}
{"text":"The best Sonoran hot dogs ever. The bread is so fresh and soft and all the condiments make it super good."}
{"text":"If you've never had a Sonoran dog, don't go another week without one. Even if you don't speak Espanol, go there, it's fun and authentic!  I was lucky because I can walk to it. At  $3 each, have 2, add a Mexican coke and you'll feel like you're south of the border! :Yum!"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing service!  Limited English spoken, but the ladies are so welcoming and helpful that you kinda get a mi casa es su casa vibe. It feels kinda like an extended family cookout, if that makes any sense.  Dogs were super tasty.  What a treasure to find up in my neck of the woods. I will definitely be going back.  In fact......I think I'm gonna to go right now."}
{"text":"Best hotdogs in town! Great prices and quick service. I've taken the family here multiple times and always top notch quality. When I introduce new people here they love it."}
{"text":"BEST. HOT. DOGS. EVER. It's very hard to find authentic Sonoran hot dogs but Lupita has created the best hot dog I've had in AZ. They are clean, fast, and delicious! Their customer service is awesome!! They also have champurrado (Mexican hot chocolate) during the winter which is amazing!!"}
{"text":"My husband loves hotdogs and we are from out of state and had to try this spot since it had great reviews. It's one of the top 5 best hotdogs we have had. It's very good."}
{"text":"These hot dogs rival what can be found in Tucson, they're just as good or even better!"}
{"text":"AMAZING. Had the Sonoran Dog con todo....won't disappoint. Great service as well!!!"}
{"text":"Best hotdogs ever! i'm from Tucson where Sonoran hotdogs are everywhere and they're always delicious best place hands-down in  Phoenix! other places get too big and forget that the taste is the most important thing in the Sonoran hotdog the flavor these hotdogs have our deliciousness! fresh ingredients in every bite."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty Sonoran hot dogs. Doesn't get much better. Very nice people also. $17 for 5 hot dogs and coke. Bar with all the side fix ins but it doesn't need it."}
{"text":"Like every other review on here, I took my wife tonight and got the Sonora dog. It's pretty amazing and you are missing out if you don't at least try one. Literally everyone there gets this hotdog."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try Lupita's whenever I have been driving by!! Always see people there and wondered if I was missing something...man was I right!!  The hotdogs were Amazing!! The staff was super sweet and helpful with the menu & suggestions! Lots of families enjoying their meals and each other! Some fruit vendors with appetizing looking fruit concoctions (we were gonna get one after our dogs but they left-Next Time)!! The meal was super reasonable!! Two cokes, three dogs and a bag of chips for $16!!! My fiancé being a super sweetheart and wanting to support hard working small business owners tipped them $20 which stunned the staff but in a Wonderful Way! We will definitely be back!! If you are like me and are considering stopping when you drive by...Hit the Brakes!! You won't be disappointed!! Nice job Lupita!! Keep Rocking your Amazing Hotdogs!!"}
{"text":"Good, but nothing special.  After reading about Sonoran hot dogs for years And never trying one, we made it a point to try what is considered the best in Phoenix.  It might be that I am spoiled by the flavors of a real Chicago dog, but this dog just didn't do it for me.  The bun and toppings were different but the dog was inferior to Chicago's Vienna beef dogs.  It was worth trying, but not worth a return visit next time we're in Phoenix.  There are just too many other quality choices to make this place a do-over.  Try it for the initial novelty, but that's about it."}
{"text":"As I've stated in previous reviews Sonoran Dogs are my thing.  I've become a sonoran dog expert over the years, and have kept a real of the next locations.  Lupita's has been moved to number one on my list here in Phoenix!  There's magic in these buns! Here's why: 1.) The first thing that I noticed was the buns are fluffier than any other vendor around. She grills them to perfection on both sides.   2.) The ingredients are balanced with equal amounts of every flavor.  She also adds the perfect amount of cotija cheese on top.  **Bonus you don't get too many beans in each bite 3.) GRILLED ONIONS (What!!) This here is the game changer.  They're not over powering, or onion-y, because she cooks them slow until they are carmelized.   I'm sorry to say that, I'm going to have to cheat on my other lady, at El Caprichoso on 19th. I'll visit her from time to time.  But, Lupita's is where it's at!"}
{"text":"I am surprised that these hot dogs were so good. Whole family loved them. Must try them and it's a causual outdoor place but hard to find"}
{"text":"Lupita goes the extra length to make sure we're taken care of. Very warm and welcoming. And the hotdogs are fantastic, especially with the Mexican sodas. A wonderful discovery and best of all she's open late! Be sure to bring cash."}
{"text":"New to the area and was looking for a good Sonoran hot dog stand , Tried this place for the first time today ... so delicious ! Two thumbs up  . Ill be back probably about once a week ... or more :) lol"}
{"text":"WOW! I've always found Sonoran dogs to be good, but never impressive. Lupita's are exceptional. The buns are like pillows. They are so soft and perfectly grilled. The bacon is crispy. The toppings always have the perfect balance. Too many Sonoran dogs are loaded with beans or sloppy with mayo; not Lupita's. The stand is right around the corner from our house, so this is a perfect late-night snack."}
{"text":"The hot dogs are amazing!! The homemade buns are what makes it exceptional! A must try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great hot dogs. The toppings are great, but the buns are absolutely delicious. They're toasted buns are soft and warm and perfectly compliment the dogs and toppings. Make sure you add the nacho cheese at the toppings bar. Definitely limited parking, no sides not even French fries, and the staff when I was there didn't really speak English, but it didn't really matter. Great dogs, we're going back ASAP"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Quality, top notch service and beat dog in town! Someone else said it is favorable if you speak Spanish as most of the employees speak little english. Personally, i don't think you can order wrong! All you need to know is \"con todo\".....its the only way to eat one!  Go, get a dog! This place is excellent! You know its good when its standing room only at 8:45pm on a Sunday night!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!  I can't believe anyone would give them anything less than 5 stars. The hot dogs are delicious, the service is quick, the food is fresh and the place is a hidden gem!!  If you drive by and think it is strange because it is under a yellow and red tent, then you will be missing out on the best hot dogs around. Get the Sonoran Dog with everything on it, in fact, get two!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!   I'm not a hotdog person but these are delicious!!  The buns are like little pillows of goodness.  The hotdog toppings have a little bit of everything you want.  And the warm roasted jalapeño served on the side gives this dog the perfect kick.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Found this place courtesy of my fellow yelpers and it did not disappoint. Never had Sonoran hot dogs, and love trying new foods, so I was definitely excited when I saw this. The hot dog comes dressed with tons of goodies, and if that wasn't enough, there's also a toppings bar to add if you want stadium cheese, spicy salsa, mushrooms or pickles. I had one with everything except mayo, and if this tent was close to my home, would definitely become a regular. A large chile comes on the side. I took friends there and for 4 people to dine it was under $30. Everything about the dogs were high quality including the buns."}
{"text":"This is a true hidden gem! Clean, friendly, impeccable service and the Sonoran Dog is a must! In our hood, so we definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Last weekend first timer here and the food was awesome along with the service. Tonight I went again and was disappointed with the food and different people who made the food. I was also charged double for less food I ate this time then last time. Do not go here unless you are able to waste money. Pure racist I think! 4 extra dollars charged...."}
{"text":"I drove here 25 minutes from Cave Creek because of the reviews on Yelp. Like many, I LOVE simple street food, a nd love to root for the small guy who is disadvantaged. However, I will not gratuitously leave a 5 star review because it is fashionable, or because  \"....everyone is doing it!..\"  I didn't read ALL the reviews, so I didn't realize that the business existed under a tent in the parking lot of a tire store, with  ABSOLUTELY NO signage. Anyway, after following the G.P.S. and finding nothing that remotely resembled a taco stand, I called the number on Yelp!. The lady answered, and was linguistically challenged,but managed to say that  she was opening at 6:40, not 6 pm as it says online.  She could not verify the location, however, so she put what I assume was her son on the phone. After verifying the address, and that there was no signage, so I WAS in the right place! He then repeated that they would open at 6:40 pm.  What an odd freaking time I thought....and went and had a pint of beer, as it was 6:05. These things happen, right?....the manana attitude.  When I came back at  6:50, they had just pulled in the tire store parking lot, and had not even BEGUN preparing any food. When I asked how long for a hot dog, I was told, \"...about 25 or 30 minutes ...\" by the son.  Now I WAS irritated. I drove nearly a half hour, waited another 50 minutes past their posted opening time, showed up when they told me to, and it was going to be another half hour. . When I said Yelp! said 6pm he replied...\"yeah, they need to change that.\"  I told the Einstein that Yelp does not track and change his business hours on his whim, that was his job. \"Oh, I didn't know that.\" When I asked why he told me to come back at 6:40, he shrugged and said. \"Sorry..\" and walked away."}
{"text":"Great service, AMAZING FOOD, very attentive and they have a condiments bar that has well over anything you might crave for your hot dogs! This place is clean and well put together! I am glad I live down the road from here I can always swing by and grab a dog or two on those late work nights when I can't get home and cook!"}
{"text":"Seriously... I came here yesterday.. SOBER... and I came here today.... DRUNK .. and it only gets better! These are the best hot dogs I've ever had!!! I will deff be back here from CA!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have been on the lookout for REAL Sonoran dogs for almost a year and finally we found them. Great customer service and delicious hot dogs! They're totally worth the drive. We have even snook them into the movies in my lady's purse which she was not happy about the forever hot dog scent in there (no regrets). Once you try Lupita's hot dogs you will be addicted and crave them at least twice a week!"}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this place. Hotdogs are superb and staff helpful. The only thing that sometimes sucks is the wait to get served! This place gets so busy (specially) in the evening or later at night. Servers are busy and running around that sometimes they skip you. But if you get their attention they are always willing to help and take your order."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Of course you have to order in Spanish but if you at least know half ass Spanglish like I do, you'll be fine. The parking situation could definitely use some work but thankfully I was able to snag the last available spot. I ordered 2 hot dogs to go + 2 sodas. The service is EXCELLENT! Although me and the lady didn't communicate the best due to the language barriers, she acknowledged that I was next in line even after some \"regular\" tried to cut in front of me(I wasn't standing in the right spot to order I guess). She took charge and quickly put him in his place. I really appreciated that, and it will go a long way. Next.. I LOVE condiments. Their condiment station is AWESOME! Selection includes: chopped onions, guac, lemon, pickles, nacho cheese, chipotle sauce and more. They also have the small condiment cups and baggies. The ambiance is nice and welcoming, nice lighting, large enclosed clean tent. The wait wasn't too bad but I think I'll call in my order next time if I'm just picking up. I will definitely be back! (Better than guero canelos)"}
{"text":"Delish! Yummy hotdogs with lots of great toppings. The hotdog is wrapped in bacon, yummy bun and an array of toppings like different cheeses, I think they were some Mexican cheese as well as melted cheese, mushrooms, jalapeño, so many you can really make a unique dog. The folks were so friendly! Make this a must do!"}
{"text":"Best hot dogs my wife and I have ever heard of. They are Sonoran style, with beans, degieo, white cheese, jalapeños, and more. A modest establishment with nice, authentic people. We will be back. Probably more often than we should."}
{"text":"The Sonoran dog is seriously the best hot dog I've ever had. So glad we checked it out"}
{"text":"Best hot dogs ever had in Phoenix! Service was AMAZING and the area was super clean! Fast,Friendly and Fresh!"}
{"text":"Rude ass customer service no place to park they take 30 min to  take your order. then you get your food and it's like your paying for them to stare at you the whole time they make your food! Nobody smiles or welcomes you!  the hot dogs are okay not worth the bad service or the extra drive and time"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy the buns are so soft and delicious the staff is extremely friendly super quick and they take credit cards now Tass the only thing stopping me from been here often before since I don't carry cash ever and every time I do they take it all because there are so dam good"}
{"text":"Taste like hot dogs straight from Mexico! You have the option of stuffing your hot dog with tomatoes, pinto beans, onions, cheese, mushrooms, nacho cheese, guacamole sauce, chipotle sauce, jalapeño sauce, mustard, and ketchup. The bun tastes so yummy fluffy, warm, and soft. It's hot dog heaven. The owner Lupita is amazing truly a hard worker that isn't afraid of cleaning some tables and cooking. I admire her attention to detail just fantastic customer service. And the hot dogs my oh my just deliciousness. Words can't describe the feeling of being surrounded of such a happy vibe! Also you can call and order to pick up your food to go. It's a wonderful service."}
{"text":"One of the best Sonoran dogs I've had in Phoenix. the ladies totally know how to make a delicious dog for a cheap price. not everyone speaks English here but it's pretty easy to get what you want. They sell drinks and chips but if you're not satisfied with one I'd just get another one! It's situated under a pop up tent with seating that's clean, bright, and welcoming. When we went the place was bustling with laughter and families all eager for the food. The ladies who were cooking and working were so nice! The dogs are topped when you get them with the softest grilled buns. They come with a grilled pepper on the side that's not spicy but actually smoky and a little sweet. Awesome late night stop, we try and go there whenever we can! Only downside is that they only accept cash, but that's not a big deal considering they're about $3 a piece and definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Super friendly people and great dogs wrapped with bacon. Everything was hot fresh and delicious. The buns they use are the best ever, very soft and moist wish I knew how to get these for home. The Sonoran dogs are $3 each, don't forget to add the nacho cheese at the condiment bar. I think they open at around 5.30 pm."}
{"text":"Best Sonoran dogs around and can't beat the price. It's an outdoors yet has covered seating so the weather may not be your best friend at times. I have been their in the later hours and it's a great meal after a long day. Everyone is very friendly and attentive.  Glad this is nearby!"}
{"text":"The best Sonoran hotdogs ever!!! You want to bring friends and family to come and try it out."}
{"text":"Muy ricos Hot Dogs, además de un servicio rápido. Me encanta que uno pueda hacer su pedido por teléfono para llevar. Es un lugar que ha crecido mucho.. La atención es muy buena también.. Me gusta ir a este lugar por qué la comida no está precalentada... Todos los ingredientes se sienten frescos. Esta carrera tiene mucha oportunidad de crecimiento.."}
{"text":"After living in Tucson for a few years and being spoiled by enjoying the delectable \"Sonoran Dog\" in its native environment.... I only ordered them in Phoenix a couple of times before I decided Tuscon alone held the secret to it's elusive magic. Boy was I wrong....right up the street from me in my  own neighborhood at a red and yellow cabana covered parking lot....there is a hotdog stand I've passed thousands of times without ever sampling their amazing take on the Sonoran dog, I say \"take\" because Lupitas serves their's with far less pinto beans and mayonnaise than the traditional dish, which is of course, not authentic, it's much better actually. The service really good and an awesome young man named Gonzalez answered my questions patiently. I wanted to know what made the Sonoran dog different than others I've had and he was kind enough to tell me that they put a very small amount of all of the following toppings on their dog; grilled onions, Guacamole, tomatoes, Cotija cheese, mayonnaise, Pinto beans (a lot less of this particular item then how most soggy Sonoran dogs are served) and an extra large portion of love. And that flavor supersedes all the others! Try these three dollar little gourmet delicacies, you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"This is honestly the best place for Sonoran Hot Dogs ever!  I can't say enough good about the people that run the stand, we are very lacking in our Spanish skills but we always seem to make out fine in the end!"}
{"text":"Best Street Hot Dogs Ever!!!! Thank god I moved down the street and can enjoy the hot dogs on a regular basis! You have to go!"}
{"text":"Great dogs, fresh soft hot dog buns too!!!  Very  friendly atmosphere and fast good service."}
{"text":"Very good Sonoran hot dogs. Open late at night. Best part is I don't have to drive to south Phoenix for good street food."}
{"text":"The ladies at Lupita's definitely know Sonoran Dogs. The bread tastes like they bake it fresh to order. All the toppings melt in your mouth with intense flavor explosions. A must try for hot dogs lives in the North valley."}
