{"text":"Unorganized and dirty place. Bad food with poor service.
We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Now this place was an experience :) . It took about 70 mins to get our order ... no exaggeration. Owner was one old lady trying to save money by making chefs do servings and talking way too much... kind of small kitchen but aura reminds one of Pakistani Tandoor. Decent food but it will take a long way for them to improve their service. Maybe I would skip this one next time ..."}
{"text":"Great price to portion ratio! Great food! Only complaint I have is the fact that it does take them a while to make the food because of how busy they always are.... so order ahead!!! 

WAIT ONE MORE BIG THING. The owner lady at the front is amazing, excellent customer service, definitely knows how to run a high volume restaurant. BUT when that lady is not there, its an older gentlemen... I think he may be her husband... and this man is the complete opposite, very rude to customers, and verrrrrry cheap too... hate him!!"}
{"text":"Don't bother going to this restaurant unless you feel like waiting 2 hours+ for your food! Horrible service, dirty restaurant, and food is not cooked properly! Run!"}
{"text":"Place interior could be better it looks like a typical market restaurant in India. Lady who served the food was super friendly but talkative, she assured me that the food was made fresh to order. I bought the butter chicken special and waited for at least 25 mins. One thing that's good about this place is that the kitchen is open so that you could see how they make the food (no microwave). I paid around 10 bucks for naan, butter chicken, and rice. The quantity was ALOT! I took it back home and really enjoyed the food! Thats why my rating is 3 out of 5, only because of the food. They should really change the interior to be more attractive. I think it was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This Pakistani restaurant has great prices (kebabs are $1.79 each) and I've enjoyed their food in the 2 visits I've been. The biryani ,kebabs and naan are excellent and not greasy (unlike the very overpriced Lahore Tikka.) They also have a good variety of tandoori items. As other reviewers have commented, it does take a while for the food to arrive (it's prepared while you wait, you can see into the kitchen.) The decor is quite plain but OK. The female owner is quite friendly."}
{"text":"Rather than going all the way to Gerard Street for \"Authentic Indian Food\" a little trip to this spot is much better. Great service and food."}
{"text":"One time I ordered a whole tray of biryani at night. By the time I reached Pearson airport (30 mins), it had gone spoiled. I was so shocked and angry. Must have been sitting there all day so it definitely wasn't fresh. 

Awful and rude service. Went to this restaurant a couple times and everytime had to go back because they got my order wrong. I get mad just thinking about this place. I'd always go back because the food isn't actually bad like the kebabs and naan, hence the 1 star. But I won't be going back nor will I ever recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I have eaten at thousands of restaurants and have had various ethnic foods from expensive restaurants with waiters waiting at my table to restaurants where they just slide the plates across the table. But this is my favourite of all foods.  

Spices in perfect combination to satisfy the senses.  Food fit for a Maharaja."}
{"text":"Good tasting food, friendly service, family owned. Presentation and atmosphere could use an upgrade.

I can never decide what to order so I usually choose a platter that includes a little bit of everything. Go there for the food, not the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been going to Shahi for years ordering the biryani. I have given some to my friends downtown and they always ask for some when I go out to see them. The taste is excellent, the price is amazing. Every time I leave Toronto for extended periods I always look forward to returning to eat here. The Lahori fish is also very tasty, and I reccomend it to all."}
{"text":"The food does take a while to arrive but it was well worth the wait. The butter chicken and tandoori chicken is AMAZING will go backfire sure but not when I'm starving."}
{"text":"The old guy you see here ( i think hes the owner) is damn rude, he needs to learn some manners. The food is ok, but the quantity has def decreased over time, also be aware  often times the biryani is stale."}
