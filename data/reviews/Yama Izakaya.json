{"text":"We had the duck,  oysters, monkfish liver,  shrimp shumai, Wasabi octopus and the curried lamb. It was all great. The best food we have had in Charlotte. The service was exceptional at the bar. We will be back often."}
{"text":"I had the seafood udon and every noodle, every spoonful of broth, every boiled critter pried from its shell was wonderful. I sat at the bar and the tender could develop a personality, but I came for the food, which was a pleasure."}
{"text":"Ramen Background, I moved to Charlotte from San Francisco about a year ago. My wife and I went Ramen camping on Sundays in SF Bay area. The best Ramen shops would sell out as soon as the soup was gone. So you had to arrive 1 hour before opening and get on a 30 minute waiting list, hence Ramen Camping. SF bay area started our addiction for Ramen. We have had delicate seafood Ramen in Japan to this crazy Parmesan cheese spicy Ramen in Oahu HI. Anyways, my goal is to eat all the 26 distinct styled of Ramen in Japan.   So, back to moving to NC, the Asian Food SUCKS in Charlotte. BBQ is bomb here, but Asian food is to sweet for no reason and so Americanized?!?! Why, people here want the real deal. Yama, had real Ramen, the tonkatsu is really nice, great balance if Dashi and pork broth, huge slices of  chashu pork. Not the best I've had but it's a start for Charlotte. Keep it up Yama! Good stuff and please don't  listen to people who say your soup is not salty enough, they don't know Ramen.   Suggestion for Ramen, make your own Noddles, nothing wrong with dried noddles but fresh would set it off!! And, try new tonkatsu styles like black broth Kuro ramen from Mara Ichi in Mountain View CA, or spicy parmesan ramen from Agu Ramen in Oahu Hawaii. Your ramen price is also a bit high but i will still be back regularly"}
{"text":"first time here and boy was i impressed with the food, love all the small bites and the shio ramen was  the best i ever had!  look forwrd to try the tonkatsu ramen next time  pork belly bun was to die for and the homemade gyoza was delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was alright, but nothing really stood out.  We had the Spicy Miso, which was zero spicy, and a handful of the \"small bite\" appetizers.  Nothing was bad, but again, nothing was really good.  The waitstaff was really annoying, and we didn't really have just one waiter.  There was about 4 or 5 different people that constantly checked on our table, each bringing us/refilling our waters without asking.  Usually this is something I'm for, but at one point we had 12 glasses of water for 6 people at our table.  Instead of taking away the empty cups, the random waiters just continued to fill them.  This is also one of those places that doesn't write your order down, and they attempt to memorize everything.  Some places do it well, however this is not one of those places.  We had to remind our waitress a handful of times about missing items that she forgot to put in, and they brought us wrong food twice."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend basically tried everything on the menu and it was all delicious!!  I love the miso ramen and everything in the yakitori list, the bites are really tasty and everything is reasonably priced.  We were really impressed with the food and sake list, they have sake by the carafe and magnums too.  Only thing my boyfriend complaints about was too much ice in his drink which I thought was nothing  Will be back very soon a cool and comfortable place to hang too as well!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. I can't wait to go back. I'm down to try anything and I let the owner know that. Moments later he dropped a random bowl of raw fish in front of me. It was perfect. Come to find out it was raw squid with wasabi!! Soooo Gooooddd!!!  The squid balls were also a great small plate, but don't forget about the smoked pork belly yakatori!! Very delicious!!  It's also great that they have late night hours to serve those late night cravings."}
{"text":"Great place! We drive 45 min from Gastonia to try this place because my friends can't stop talking about it.  It was worth every min of my time. The food is fantastic and the staff is friendly, I love the atmosphere and they have Japanese toilet in the restroom! Haha.  Everything was tasty, ramen comes in a big serving I had to get it to go   I will be back next week!"}
{"text":"Decent restaurant. I had the tonkitsu and pork belly skewer. The ramen broth was decent and not salty, but wasn't amazing. It was disappointing to receive the ramen with the seaweed already absorbed in the soup. It would have been better if the meats were presented on top of the broth not already mixed in and with the seaweed being dry.  The pork belly was advertised as a thin slice of fat with a larger portion of meat, but hat was not the case. The skewer was mainly chewy fat with minimal amounts of meats. Also, I was expecting it to be more grilled."}
{"text":"I am so glad that I tried this place! The service was wonderful and the menu selection was impressive. Lots of popular Japanese pub dishes. All the food I had was delicious and I will be coming back to try more!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a meal or snack and hangout with some friends eating ramen and drink sake. They open really late, so when I'm hungry at night, this is where I think of and they never let me down everytime I come."}
{"text":"My new \"Go To\" noodle restaurant!! Great service, great food!  Can't wait to continue exploring the menu!!"}
{"text":"Nice clean decor, but it's an empty restaurant. Which is no surprise. Anyway, a restaurant is ALL about the food.  I don't think anyone sets out searching for Japanese delicacies thinking, \"You know what I'd really like? Some bland Miso Ramen Noodles and greasy pot-stickers!\" Yep, If you do want some bland food, though? This is the place. No \"Umami\" here."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the service/quality - it may be a novelty restaurant for folks that don't really know what good ramen is, but this is not it.  Dumplings were pretty good, but if you go a few block up Central to Dim Sum they are way better.  I gave 3 stars because I wanted to like this place, really only deserved 2."}
{"text":"We dined here for my boyfriends birthday a few days ago and we were highly disappointed with the food. The miso ramen had a rank, overly fishy taste and smell making it inedible. The pork ramen was okay, but it also had an unpleasant, spoiled taste to it as well. Overall I would say that the food is overpriced and poorly executed. Soul gastrolounge down the street is a much better option for both ramen and tapas."}
{"text":"I just moved from NYC to Charlotte a few months ago. A former religious Yelp viewer, I never felt compelled to write a review before- I was a server during high school and college- I usually reserve my empathy for the restaurant staff...  Positives: The restaurant decor is comfortable and fairly edgy. Different from what you'll usually see in Plaza Midwood, a nice change of pace.  Hostess seated us immediately, away from the drafty door.  Server came to introduce himself and take out drink order almost immediately. Filled water glasses without being asked.  Bathrooms were extremely clean.    Order: My partner ordered Teriyaki Steak, medium.  I ordered green tea, Ika Geso and Yaki Udon.   Teriyaki Steak arrived first, my partner waited for something to appear for me- as it's usually considered fairly rude to begin eating when the other person does not have a plate.   Next my tea arrives, luke warm to cold.   Udon arrives next. We both begin to eat. The udon was hot, and the base was flavorful. I was surprised that Yaki Udon was listed in the menu without meat, but I figured for $13 the vegetables would have been more than the tail end of what appeared to be bok-choy, shredded carrots and the stem of american broccoli. There were 3 slices of a shiitake mushroom also.   I asked who I will later learn is the manager the whereabouts of the Ika Geso which is brought out within a couple of minutes. The Ika Geso was chewy, the consistency of a piece of saltwater taffy. I was ready to send it back but my partner said not to bother he would eat it.   My partner stopped in the middle of his plate and simply said that he lost his appetite because his steak was overcooked and had no flavor. I took a bite and it was indeed not cooked medium and lacked that sweet and savory tang of teriyaki.  The experience however came to its peak when I met the manager. I let him know about our experience and I can honestly say I have never encountered someone so indignant before.  I mentioned waiting for a second plate to arrive so my partner and I would have something at the same time and to which he replied that the restaurant is bar type/small plates and therefore no dishes will come out in sync... Which is fine, I suggested to him training staff to ask patrons whether they are first time guests and making it known that two people may not get plates together.   I mentioned my tea came out after the food and cold. For this he apologized.  I then mentioned I was disappointed with the Ika Geso, and he said that it is the end of the tentacle, and implied I was expecting some type of calamari... This is where I started to get extremely upset... I understand what it is, I have had the dish before, I did not say the dish is not what I expected, but rather it was chewy. It maybe the texture he is accustomed to eating at Yama Izakaya, but it is not the texture I am accustomed to having lived in Japan in addition to more positive experiences in NYC.   The icing on the cake comes when I explained we were additionally dissatisfied with the steak. It was cold by the time the udon arrived (which the manager did not hesitate to retort with a snarky- \"but it was hot when it arrived, yes?\") but when the flavor was brought up- he was condescending to my boyfriend and said something to the effect of \"were you expecting hibachi teriyaki.\"  I was trying to keep my cool and be reasonable, I acknowledged what was eaten and said that I would like my tea comped because I did not drink it and asked that 1/2 of the cost of the teriyaki be comped as well. I took full responsibility for the squid and my entree, even though they weren't great- I ate my dish and my partner ate most of the quid.   The manager begrudgingly said he would comp the tea and that's all, gave a half hearted -I am sorry you misunderstood the concept of this restaurant.   By some miracle after disappearing for a few minutes, he returns with the check, comping the tea and the squid and gave what sounded more like the apology I had half-expected to hear in the beginning and asked to consider the restaurant in the future.   I certainly will give Yama another try... Once I know that they are under new management."}
{"text":"Go ahead and ignore all the posts about whether or not this is an authentic representation of Japanese cuisine. This place could be about as inauthentic as Panda Kitchen and I would go back. The tonkotsu is so tasty that it needs no signifier as to whether or not it remind someone of that time they studied abroad in Tokyo. Call up a loved one and invite them out for a tantalizing night of slurping down beef bone broth and noodles."}
{"text":"Shocked by all these good reviews. We thought the food was terrible and the atmosphere cold.   It's a shame since we love the original in South Park."}
{"text":"A little disappointed after seeing such high reviews for this place. The food was only average, however, the ambience and the customer service was definitely on a much higher caliber. We ordered the pork belly buns for our appetizer - those were the only food item that we felt was amazingly delicious and worth getting again. For entrees, we got the yaki udon, the tonkatsu ramen and the miso ramen. The yaki udon was less than average with a lot more vegetables than there were noodles. The ramens were both fairly good and flavorful but nothing that we would crave or want to come back for. Also, the waiter said that all ramens come with the same ingredients aside from the soup broth, but one of the ramens was missing a few ingredients that the other ramen had which was disappointing. The ramen also had a lot of MSG in it which left us really thirsty. Overall, it was just an okay dining experience and while we might not be highly recommending this place to anyone, we also didn't hate it."}
{"text":"I never leave reviews, good or bad, but I feel that this place is bad enough to warrent a review. I was excited to try this place because I love Asian food, especially Japanese. However, I was very dissapointed with the quality of the food. At first I thought I simply didn't like the food, as I ordered several dishes I have never had before. However, even the eel (my favorite type of seafood), was bad. It tasted especially fishy (more so than normal seafood) and the skin was strange and mushy. All of the other dishes (expect the pork belly and mochi) were bad. Soon after my husband and I finished the meal, my husband threw up. He has since thrown up 3 times and has had diarrhea (with blood) several times. I have been nausea ever since we ate. To much information, I know, but I feel it is necessary to share so others may take my story into consideration before eating there. My husband called the restaurant to let them know he was sick and very upset with the food. He did not intend to receive a full refund and was more than willing to let them keep the tip and drink cost. However, the owner (via the server on the phone because the owner couldn't speak directly to my husband?) refused to compensate him in any way until he provided a doctor's note because they supposedly checked their food supply and it was fine. They also claimed  that it takes 12 to 24 hours to show signs of food poisoning. The server explained that upon proof of food poisoning they would give my husband a 50 dollar gift card to the restaurant  (as if we plan on eating there again). While I completely understand why they would be skeptical and wish to protect their business, it seems ridiculous that the owner failed to speak directly with my husband and refused to make the situation right. As far as I am concerned, the owner is not my husband employer and therefore doesn't need a doctor's note. It's not like my husband is trying to sue the restaurant. He simply wanted compensation for a less than satisfactory meal. Had that happened, I wouldn't feel the need to leave a bad review. I guess quality food and customer satisfaction is not important to the owner."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the restaurant is beautiful. The food is presented well, the tables, everything is visually appealing. Unfortunately the food? Not so much. I ordered the shitaki mushrooms and fried dumplings, the portions were crazy small for the price, and seriously lacked flavor. Everything was either really bland or entirely too salty. Our server was really helpful and friendly, but that did not make up for the lack of tastyness unfortunately. I have to say this was just not a win for me. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very authentic food and fantastic atmosphere.  The spicy miso ramen and the octopus balls are delicious!   The chicken broth ramen and the potato croquettes were pretty good, too."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I started with the fried octopus balls and the seared steak small plates. Both were excellent, great flavors on both. Washed them down with some delicious Japanese beers. Followed this up with the beef wrapped mushroom yakitori. I really loved this, especially the texture. We both ended with the tonkostu, ramen in pork bone broth. I was a little worried this wouldn't fill me up, but that was not the case. I had to take a break, after finishing mine before proceeding to finish the one my girlfriend ordered. The broth was so good I couldn't stop eating, even though I was really full. I am not proud of that, but it was all just too good. Before coming here I didn't even like Japanese food. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu. So glad to have this place in the neighborhood. It was a little on the expensive side, but totally justified. Great place for a group of friends or a date night."}
{"text":"The food here was great...the presentation was awesome...the customer service was stupendous..i would recommend this restaurant for any date night"}
{"text":"Second time I've been and it was wonderful.  Great atmosphere, attentive staff, and wonderful small bites plates.  We had the curried lamb kabobs - 2 for $7,  Also had the fried dumplings which are fried just a little and served with a wonderful sauce.  Also had the seaweed salad which is awesome.  Noticed lots of tables sharing small bites and having a great time.  We also enjoyed a glass of house wine, a generous pour at $7 per glass.  It's memorable and fun and lots and lots of stuff to try."}
{"text":"It's definitely the best tonkotsu ramen you'll get in Charlotte, I found it to be the closest to what I have had on my trips to Tokyo. Takoyaki was also good, in fact everything we had was good, though I wish the tempura was more traditional (kabocha and sweet potato this time of year would have been a bonus, instead of onion). We'll definitely be going back, it's on our short list of fave places now. Service was speedy/friendly as well!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was outstanding!!!! The sushi is made fresh to order so you can customize it and everything is super fresh. Cocktails are on point!! I definitely recommend giving it a try!!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst dining experiences I had. Take your business elsewhere. Subpar food, slow service, and they don't know how to split a check."}
{"text":"A wonderful experience dining out. We had the opportunity of trying a four course select menu. 98% of the produce and livestock is locally sourced by North Carolina farmers which makes the taste exceptionally clean and flavorful. The Service only added to the exceptional experience having sorted sake. The servers were knowledgeable well trained. Charlottes hidden gem a must try for food connoisseurs wanting to taste North Carolina. We will be back.   They also have a view into the kitchen that accents the beautiful décor of the style of the restaurant and my fiancé was telling me an extra bottom bonus the bathroom has heated seats, very traditional. reminds me of my trips to japan."}
{"text":"The Ramen here is delicious! If you haven't had Japanese ramen, you have to try it. Great for a cold winters day! The pork belly here is also good with the buns"}
{"text":"While I said \"I doubt I will be returning\" on 11/3/2014, due to unforeseen circumstances (it was 10pm on a Wednesday, Soul's wait was an hour, and everything else was closed), I came back.  Such a mistake.  My experience was even less impressive this time around, and I think I can safely this is my least favorite restaurant in Charlotte based on a satisfaction to price ratio.  I didn't give it a 1-star rating because nothing out of the ordinary or egregious happened, nor did I get food poisoning... but, I just do NOT like this place.  Overpriced? check. Mediocre food? check. Ridiculously small portions? check. Incompetent service? check (but not for lack of effort, to be fair). Overpriced? check, check.  I say this twice because I cannot reiterate how small the plates are, and how unsatisfying everything was.  This time around, BF and I shared: monkfish liver, pork belly buns, tonkatsu ramen, and chicken katsu.  Everything was bad -- too salty, too fishy, too sweet, too bland, too mushy -- you name it, whatever the dish was supposed to be, it wasn't.  I'm getting mad all over again thinking about how much money I spent on that meal, and how little pleasure I derived from it.  NEVER AGAIN.  And this time, I mean it."}
{"text":"I spent awhile hunting for decent ramen in Charlotte. Let's face it - it's not the best city for food diversity. I love Yama Izakaya's tonkatsu ramen, and the fried octopus balls are awesome! Don't miss the pork belly buns, though - they're delicious."}
{"text":"Overrated. Tonkatsu was whatever. The egg wasn't even marinated and it was over cooked so it was more hard boiled than soft. The char siu was okay, but the slices were paper thin. Barely any toppings on the ramen save bamboo. Pretty disappointed. Had much better ramen in Mooresville.   Also ordered the special spicy squid legs. It was not spicy. And it was deep fried, which I was not expecting. Tasted pretty stale. Also disappointing."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service. The atmosphere is modern with Japanese aesthetics. The food is slightly pricy for a college student but it's all good. Portions are huge for ramen."}
{"text":"It's great to have Japanese restaurant that isn't sushi or hibachi or a Japanese steakhouse. They have Hitachino Nest White Ale on tap, which I didn't even know was possible.   We ordered takoyaki, okonomiyaki, gyoza, and ebi shumai. You can definitely share and make a meal out of the small plates. And that's what you would do at an izakaya in Japan.   Takoyaki and okonomiyaki both came drizzled with sauce, mayonnaise, and topped with bonito fish flakes. They were excellent! Takoyaki was nicely grilled on the outside but soft on the inside. Also very hot, so you know it's fresh. Okonomiyaki was tasty, but not as thick with tons of cabbage as I would like. Still, this is the only place in Charlotte that has it and it was good with crispy bacon on the bottom.   Gyoza were crispy on the bottom, and dumpling skins were tender without falling apart. My boyfriend didn't enjoy the ebi shumai as much but I think they were comparable to what I've had in Japan.    To cap it all off, the ladies room has a heated toilet seat with a washlet.   I will definitely be going back to try the ramen!"}
{"text":"Came here after a friend highly recommended this place and boy am I impressed!   Love the rich broth and all the small appetizers they offer.....great ambiance and service as well!  Tonkotsu ramen is a must try.....yakitoris were delicious wnd goes well with sake!"}
{"text":"My friends heard about this place that just opened up not too long ago and we decided to come try it out. I was a little hesitant because this is the same owners from Yama Asian Fusion in Southpark (I went there once for dinner and was NOT impressed at all). But I figured hey, I'll give this place at least one chance.  For small bites/yakitori, we ordered: Ika Sugatayaki (Grilled squid), Seared Tuna Salad (my favorite), Hamachi Jalapenos, Akimo (Monkfish liver), Ika Geso (fried squid tentacles), Takoyaki (fried octopus ball), and Chicken Negi (chicken on skewers). The small bites and yakitori were all pretty good and tasty. So far, so good.  For my main dish, I ordered the Tonkostu Ramen (pork bone broth) and I'm sad to say that it was only average at best. The portion was a good size but it was SO VERY BLAND tasting and kind of lacking. There's a lot of ramen and broth, but not very much of everything else. Their ramen leaves a lot to be desired to simply put it. I've had packaged ramen that had more flavor than the ramen I had here and I'm not even being facetious, that's pretty disappointing.  Service is on point, and the servers pay attention and take care of you. I'd come back to hang out with friends and to eat the small bites/yakitori but I probably won't be ordering a ramen bowl again. You won't find another restaurant in Charlotte that serves the small bites/yakitori they have, so they have that going for them but this place is average at best."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Yama Izakaya, a Japanese tavern in the Midwood neighborhood of Charlotte on a rare dinner review. This small and trendy restaurant is tucked into a shopping center, so parking is not a problem.   They offer a variety of small plates, specialty dishes, and the main dish that called us, ramen. After our first experience with ramen in DC, we planned to share, so we started with a couple small plates. First up was the Gyoza, pan-fried pork dumplings. Soft on the outside, tender and full of favor on the inside, and served with a Japanese dipping sauce that would have been great on anything. Dora here. Light, delicate, delicious!  We also tried the Fried Chicken Wings. They appeared to be like typical chicken wings until I took the first bite. The waiter told us they were seasoned with a Korean chili spice. Whatever it was, they definitely had a unique favor and were crispy and juicy.  Dora here. I wish I was a fan of chicken wings because they always smell delicious! I gave these a try, but they didn't tempt me with a second bite.   Now if you have never tasted ramen, you are missing out. Ramen is an Asian-style soup with noodles, and we chose the Miso Ramen. Marinated Braised Pork Belly (chashu), seaweed (nori), sesame seeds, scallions, bamboo shoots (menma), seasoned egg (sometimes called a Ramen egg), corn, and colorful fish cakes. The ramen was very good and the taste of the pork and seafood rose above everything else.   Dora here. Don't let all the names scare you. It's just a soup with some deliciously flavorful elements. Tasty, warm, and a wonderful go-to comfort food in winter. This photo really doesn't do the serving size justice. It's a HUGE bowl! We ordered extra toppings in DC, but forgot to do that this time. If you plan to share, adding extra toppings might make it a bit beefier, er...porkier. :) Oh, and the restaurant rates this \"spicy.\" Maybe a little kick but definitely not a forehead slicker. Go for it!  Our server might've scored higher if he didn't keep pushing the Sake and spoke a little slower for us hearing-challenged folks. And the music? Hoping that same constant beat changes before our next visit. :)  We rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food. ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"Awesome place to go to. Pub environment. I got the bacon wrapped asparagus, spicy cumin lambs, and Tonkostu. Everything was delicious. Even got to talk to the owner. Real nice guy and passionate about cooking and making his restaurant THE place to go to. The waiter was knowledgeable, gave suggestions since it was my first time going there, and was very friendly."}
{"text":"Prior to Yama Izakaya, my only ramen experience in Charlotte was not good.  I've now been to Yama Izakaya twice and it has been great both times.  Both times I have ordered the Tonkostu Ramen.  The broth has good flavor and the portion is very generous.  My only very small complaint is that I love soft boiled eggs in ramen and this place seems to serve hard boiled eggs.  I have also shared the tempura sampler, shrimp shumai, beef wrapped in asparagus, seaweed salad and shishito peppers.  All were good but I did not care for the shumai much, it was sort of fishy.   Overall good place and I will be back."}
{"text":"working in the service industry, its hard to ruffle our feathers. me and a few coworkers after work called yama to see when they closed. we arrived half an hour before closing time, knowing we were gonna have to keep it snippy and the entire time we felt like we were imposing. the bartender was rushing us, basically everything was rushed. theres a golden rule, at least in my opinion, is that you take care of other service industry people. its just implied, and because \"we get eachother\" but for me personally the times ive gone in there just to get a quick bite, they say they are closed although they say they are open online. i just ignored it. long story short, the staff doesnt seem like they get enough business to stay open late hours. poor them. but obviously they dont care for your business either. im sorry to say it but go somewhere else where youll be treated nicely and that you arent a burden the entire time. coming from a frequent visitor. i just really love japanese cuisine.

{"text":"We tried this place two times so far. First time we tried it we did not like it at all. Everything was sooo bland that we figured they ran out of salt in the kitchen so they decided to serve everything with out salt...lol We stayed away for about 2 months and went back the other day to give it another try.  We ordered some yakitori and shio ramen and tonkotu ramen.  The food this time was much better ( I think they had salt this time ;)) The food is very average here ( I can probably make the yakitori much better at home..) The service is okay...kind of slow...  Not sure if we will be giving them another chance."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite spot for ramen I have ever been to in the Charlotte area!!!! They are the most authentic and delicious place I have stumbled across! Needless to say this is one of my staple restaurants I will keep coming back to! If your looking for a amazing ramen place look no further! And they are open late so this is where it's at!!!:) fun times great food!!!!"}
{"text":"First visit - got the full overview and based on yelp reviews were able to make some solid choices. Fried octopus ball, spicy miso ramen, cumin pork, bacon wrapped scallops (are they ever bad?!??)   Portabella mushroom skewers were dry.. Unoki mushroom, no wrapping interesting but not great.   Service and atmosphere were great."}
{"text":"Wow,, nasty gross fish cake. So we complained about the Japanese pancake. And then the chef came out of nowhere and starting yelling at us. It was quite shocking. We will be surprised if this place stays in business."}
{"text":"Update:  Dinner was very nice. The server knew more about Gluten Free then the Janine person. He helped navigate the very limited menu, making my dishes with salt and pepper and no sauces. So the food was very bland, including the rolls.   Fun time with friends, not a good food destination, place for a drink only.     Not very helpful on food allergies. The menu does not show ingredients or gluten free or any other relevant information. Here is my communication with this restaurant.

{"text":"If you're new to Japanese cuisine outside of the common sushi, you're in for a treat!  The restaurant offers a variety of appetizers, small plates, and entrees to try. The tapas-style setting is great for groups willing to share a taste of dishes.  Be warned that the small plates are in fact \"petite portions\" and they do skew a tad pricey, ranging from $6-12 per dish.  I can't say it's The Best, but the food is consistent and the menu definitely exceeds you're typical \"hibachi\" joint.  My favorites were the Spicy Beef (marinated beef), Ebi Shumai (shrimp dumpling), and Okonomiyaki (pancake).  Overall it was a good experience and I'll certainly be going back for the Ramen!"}
{"text":"This spot was a newfound GEM.  I am so happy that finally there is a true Izakaya  (Japanese gastrolounge) here in Charlotte finally:  Yakitori & Other small bites, Home-made Ramen soups, and Sakes.  Just to level set, this is an izakaya restaurant so don't expect sushi (that's offered at their other restaurant, Yama Asian in Southpark) or any hibachi.  Their ramen soup broth is made from scratch and cooked down for a really loooooong time, the way you're supposed to do it. Everything we had was skillfully seasoned, prepared, and grilled/cooked.   Highly recommended and not overly priced like Baku in Southpark."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to eat in Plaza Midwood!  My husband always orders the tonkatsu ramen bowl and gives me his bamboo chutes and some of his pork. They only have 4 sushi rolls, but I think the Osaka roll is the best in Charlotte. Hands down amazing place. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"We went on Saturday evening for an early dinner. Got there right after 5, when they opened, so there was plenty of room and the service was great. I can't speak to what it's like when it's busy. The food was really good though! We got steamed pork buns, gyoza, and we both got Tonkotsu ramen. I'd have liked to have greater options to be able to personalize the ramen more, (thick noodles, spicy, kakuni), but the flavor of the broth was great, and seemed to develop and get deeper the further I got into my bowl, which was great. Pork buns were terrific, gyoza was ok, and ramen was above average, but not the best I've ever had. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant 5/5 for a couple of reasons. Bryan, our server, was super awesome & friendly. He was very attentive & hardworking. To start for food, we got the Boombastic sushi. This has to be one of my favorites. The sweet potato perfects the roll. Next, My boyfriend ordered teriyaki chicken & he absolutely loved the sweet flavor of the teriyaki and the tenderness of the chicken. It was cooked just right. I got the tonkatsu ramen, and I just have to say, this is probably the best ramen house in Charlotte. I highly recommend and will come back again. To end on a final note, the restaurant is clean & feels very \"chill\"."}
{"text":"FAVE ASIAN SPOT IN CHARLOTTE. Not as big of a sushi assortment as you'd think for a Japanese place."}
{"text":"I love this place! The menu is amazing and inexpensive. The service isn't the best, however, I can over look that when the food makes up for it. This is one place you should try out. Make sure to order the pepper skewers!"}
{"text":"Ramen is great. Reminiscent of stuff you would get in nyc. The sushi was awesome too. Lots of flavor and made with good ingredients. Despite the strip mall location, the inside is refined."}
{"text":"So, this is a pretty sad day for me because I've been a huge advocate for this place. I've loved it for 2 years...but today I had luke warm Tonkotsu Ramen with very little broth and the noodle texture was all wrong. I've had this ramen over and over again, but am a little disappointed in the quality.   I had the Hamachi nigiri as well and the temperature felt off on that too. My husband had the Udon noodles and had no complaints though.   Lastly, it was FREEZING inside so we opted to move outside and our waitress had no problem with it. Not saying this is an overall negative review because 4/5 times its great here, but somewhat out of the ordinary...going to give it another try eventually."}
{"text":"Great ramen! I have to go back to try the tapas again. The ramen is plenty to fill you up. Being Japanese I can assure you this place has great ramen!"}
{"text":"Love the tonkotsu!!!! The best in Charlotte! I came here after a bad experience at futo buto and I love Yama! I always go here when I'm craving ramen! Serves is decent, sometimes you get a waitress/waiter that don't care too much on checking on you then there are times when you do get a great server. I'm a server for 6 years so I know half ass serve when I see it. I highly recommend the tonkotsu and the asparagus wrapped with bacon! Tonkotsu here is always on point! I wish they had more option of spice. They have this pepper flake and chill oil thing but I used about a half of each and extra extra jalapeño to get it really spicy. So it would be nice to have more spice options. I really wanted to give them a 4.5 star but the reason I wouldn't give them 5 star is because they have this policy where if there is 6 or more people they split the whole bill between everyone. I never heard of this before in my life and it is a little confusing. So if you are cool with that then awesome but if your not, I suggest to go with no more then 5 people. I highly recommend this place!!! Tonkotsu is the best here!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy ramen! I love the pork bone broth. I always order extra veggies. The wing appetizer is meh but dumplings are great."}
{"text":"So we went here last night for my friends birthday.  It was a Monday so as expected it wasn't super busy which was great.  I ordered to Tonkatsu ramen, a popular favorite, and it was absolutely delicious.  This time I ordered the grilled duck as a small bite and they did a really great job.  The server was super attentive and their cocktail menu is pretty decent as well.  If you're up for some refreshing food during cold weather you may want to check this place out."}
{"text":"Had their Tonkostu ramen and a vegetarian ramen. Portion size: really good!! I could just have half. Flavor: Tonkostu-really flavorful broth and was yum.  To be honest, I have had better ramen.  Vegetarian ramen- mushroom broth lacked flavor and wasn't as good."}
{"text":"Overpriced, food wasn't flavorful. But the blueberry mojito was great. Bottom line, I would go back to try the ramen and that's it. Until then, 2.5/5"}
{"text":"Although service was slightly slow (we wondered if someone else had received our order), the ramen was amazing!  My husband and I traveled to Japan in July 2015 and had authentic ramen for the first time and the ramen at Yama Isakaya is as close to authentic as I've found in the southeast.  All three of us at Yama Isakaya had the Tonkotsu (pork bone broth) and it was fantastic.  We had just come from the very rainy Belk Bowl and this was the perfect way to warm up."}
{"text":"My new favorite ramen place!   I've said before that ramen isn't really my go to asian dish, but after having Yama Izakaya, that might change going forward.  There's a couple places in Charlotte that seem to have above average Ramen, but Yama Izakaya has my vote.  First time getting Yama, my girlfriend got take out and brought it back to our apartment after a very long weekend. Ramen was what we needed. We both got different sushi and they were AWESOME. I've recently gotten into sushi so I'm still a little picky.  We got the Panther - spicy tuna, cucumber, kani, seared yellowtail, kimchi sauce, & tempura flakes + the Lake Norman - Shrimp tempura topped with seared tuna, scallion, masago, & eel sauce.  Both 5/5 would eat again. The Panther was super refreshing and the Lake Norman had quite the kick. Each came with some sort of seasoning on the side and plenty of soy sauce.  Now to the ramen. I got the spicy miso with extra pork and sweet corn. The broth and the pork here blows the broth and pork at Futo Buta out of the water and it's not even close. I liked everything about this ramen more except for maybe the noodles which were a lot more like you would see in a ramen noodle pack. Other than that, incredible.  I will be back here VERY soon and I can't wait."}
{"text":"I love the pork ramen.  Clearly,  there are people who loves the ramen and those who just don't like it at all.  So, it think the ramen is either a hit or miss.   And for those who are thinking that they use cheap ramen,  you CAN NOT be more wrong."}
{"text":"Update: I've been informed that apparently the ramen DOES come with more than just broth. It's really a shame that the menu or servers don't explain that to patrons.  All other menu items have details about each dish.  The menu description for the ramen clearly just says \"broth.\"  At any rate, now I don't feel like returning to spend additional money after my somewhat disappointing first experience."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised, hats down the best and most authentic Japanese restaurant in Charlotte!  Disclosure, if you are not adventurous enough to taste beyond chicken teriyaki, don't bother going there, you won't enjoy it.  But otherwise, have a blast!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is fine. I had the vegetarian ramen. It was a tasty meal. Large portion. But I wouldn't say it was mind blowing, but I'd go back and eat it again.   That said, let's talk about the other stuff.   First, the service. We were there on a Wednesday night. There were only about 3 tables and while the waitress was very sweet, she was totally unfamiliar with the menu.   Second, the music. Look. I'm not sure what it was. But I would bet it was the same song, on repeat, for the whole meal. It was some sort of EDM remix thing. It was loud enough that the soundtrack made itself a prominent part of our dinner."}
{"text":"5 stars for the originality, man.  A lot of legit Japanese fare that you just can't get at most other places.  Really solid."}
{"text":"On a rare snowy and icy evening in Charlotte, we ventured out found this place open for service. A prefect night for some good ramen.   We started with Kakuni Buns (smoked pork belly buns) - these were very well done: rich, meaty, a bit of sweetness. So good.  Also, started with Ika Sugatayaki - grilled whole squid - very nice with a good char  Takoyaki - Deep fried ball-shaped filled with minced or diced octopus - not my favorite but I am a Carolina boy.... (old man, whatever!)  The Miso Ramen was the census favorite even over the  Tonkatu (pork bone broth) and Shio (salted chicken broth)   They server Hitachino Nest brand brews including the Hitachino Nest Extra High (XH) which matches with sushi so nicely.  Plus we tried some of the Japanese whiskey which I would recommend again to any whiskey drinkers with an open mind and good palette."}
{"text":"They just opened.  I mean JUST opened the doors.  There isn't even a sign yet.  I think the actual grand opening is next week.  Nice decor, friendly service, and good ramen.  The booths have large pieces of rope in between them.  It gives a barrier, but yet doesn't make you feel confined.  Our server was very friendly and extremely attentive.  That said, he needs some practice with his spiel.  The descriptions of some things were extremely vague, and others just seemed more like rambles and no real point ever made.  That will all come with time, and I knew what I wanted anyhow.  As far as the food goes.  I assumed it was just a ramen bar before entering.  Only to find out later it was a Japanese style tapas bar that served ramen as well.  I really enjoyed my noodles.  It wasn't like the quality you would hope to expect in a major city like NY, San Fran, or D.C., but a nice addition to the Charlotte food scene.  With so many pho places in the area, its nice to have another option.  As per the tapas.  The small bites were pretty small bites, and not cheap either.  I wouldn't say over-priced for the area, especially at $12-13 for a huge bowl of ramen.  But at 6-12'ish plus a pop for small bites and similar prices for yakitori, it can add up fast.  Some of these little bites may be amazing and totally worth it, I'll have to try again.  However, personally, I'd rather be full for $12, than still hungry after spending $20.  For you drinkers, the bar is fully stocked.  Plenty of sake and a few beers on tap.  Bottom line is that this place has some potential.  I think local foodies will give it a chance as well as the plaza midwood scene.  I'm glad their doing a soft opening for now as they were out of a lot of things, and the staff is still wet behind the ears.  All that should get fixed ASAP.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Once before the grand opening and once after. The ramen is great - we've tried the pork and miso broth. We both liked the miso broth better (ask for the hot sesame oil). The bacon wrapped enoki is fabulous. The octopus balls were okay - the octopus was well cooked but the rest of the filling was too mushy for my taste. I got the udon with veggies and scarfed it down. Not sure what sauce was on it but it was really good.   Management was present during the most recent visit. A plate was dropped on the floor and the waitstaff missed one large shard during cleanup. The manager walked over and looked at that piece three times before a customer accidentally kicked it, picked it up, and handed it to the bartender. I'm sorry but that's just embarrassing."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time last night. Me and friends came in around 530 and were the first customers. Customer service was prompt and attentive. The chef even threw in some delicious fried chicken skins. We were the only customers for a good 30-45 so I can't comment what service would be like during a full house.  The was pretty good. We had the okonomiyaki (pancakes), shumai dumplings, fried oysters, and delicious takoyaki octopus balls! We also had the Tonkontsu Ramen, lamb skewers, and pork sandwiches for the main course. Ramen was pretty standard when compared to other quality Japanese ramen shops.   I'd come again to try the other skewers. This place is also great for sharing with friends. So everyone can try something different."}
{"text":"I moved to Charlotte from California a month ago and tried this place at random. It's really good! The food is pretty authentic, and tastes amazing! Best Ramen we've had in town! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"First time trying Yama Izakaya and went with a group, two of whom had been once before. Waitress was fantastic, very friendly and attentive. When we inquired about gluten-free options, we were informed YI does not have any, and we were told this isn't an oversight, but rather the owner is anti-gluten-free. Meaning, he is one of those people who doesn't believe Celiac disease or gluten sensitivities are actually a \"thing\". Not a great start...  Most of the group ordered noodle soup dishes and thought they were fine, but not good enough to patronize the establishment again. One of the group, the GF member, ordered teriyaki chicken, even though they knew it wasn't GF, but it was the best we could do... The chicken pieces were HORRIBLE, chewy, rubbery and gristly, and worse than you would expect from the cheapest, greasiest Chinese take-out place.   To be clear, YI doesn't even offer a GF noodle option, much less GF soy sauce. Rice noodles would be such an easy option for a restaurant such as YI to offer, but first the owner would have to care about GF guests.   Needless to say, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"So good! Definitely get pork belly buns and green tea ice cream. Best ramen I've had in Charlotte so far. Great atmosphere good service"}
{"text":"I stopped by Yama Izakaya after hearing rave reviews, but it didn't live up to the hype.   The food is fine, but it's nothing special. Probably the best ramen you'd find in Charlotte, but nowhere near the best ramen I've had in my life. Heck, not even in the top 5. It lacks that extra something special, that indescribable quality that would make it craveable. It's not particularly flavorful, which makes me think that their claims of cooking the pork belly all day were a bit of an exaggeration. There was nothing spicy on the table, the meat in the ramen was tough and overcooked, and the egg in the broth was basically just a hard-boiled let down. A soft boiled egg in super hot broth would be way better.   The izakaya wasn't much better. The waiter pointed out a number of dishes that were \"favorites,\" but nothing stood out as a signature dish.   The portions were good. The parking lot is spacious, but the location is WEIRD -- it's two doors down from a Family Dollar. What?  Worst part of the dinner was service. The waiter wasn't attentive or any good at remembering our orders. He couldn't tell us apart and totally botched the (uncomplicated, totally expected) bill payment situation.   I can't see myself going back to YI unless a friend decides to host a birthday party there. There's better food to be had in Charlotte and I only have so many days and dollars to spend in this life so I won't waste any on blah food if I can help it. But the food isn't terrible so if it's convenient for you and you just have a jonesin for some standard, Americanized pan-Asian fare, this isn't a bad bet."}
{"text":"Pretty much terrible.  The food is sub-par while being very high priced, and the staff is disrespectful.  The wait for your food takes forever and they tend to serve one person at your table, wait another 15-20 minutes to serve the next person.  The excuse is that each dish is prepared personally.  One would expect that anyway.  Prices way too high for the quality.  Would never go back."}
{"text":"Last night, a group of friends and I went out for my birthday dinner at Yama Izakaya.  The food was alright, but definitely wasn't worth $15; however, for the occasion, it was worth it.  I got the Tonkatsu, which was good, but the noodles were underdone and the broth was a little plain for my taste, but luckily there was additives that could be added.  However, the worst part of the whole night is the ridiculous service that we received.  When we sat down, the waitress failed to mention to us that she could not split checks... which is fine because I figured it was like every other place that split check that someone would just pick up another person and so on and so forth.  However, this was NOT the case.  Instead, they really meant they could not itemize the checks, so instead of letting people pay for what they wanted... they totaled everything (alcohol included) that everyone bought and split the check by the number of people there.  Are you freaking kidding me?  I wound understand this... if this place was a family eating environment, but why should I have to pay for someone's drink or food, if my food really only cost $8.  However, according to their \"policy\", they were going to charge everyone $25 each. Heck, we had people underage there, so why should they even have to pay for alcohol... if they can't even buy alcohol?  That point, should they even have a liquor license for selling alcohol to minors?  First, I tried to speak to the waitress about the situation, but she was not helpful at all.  She tried to tell me that she explained the policy, but I assured her that she did not; otherwise, I would of sat down and gone somewhere else.  Then, I later asked for some items and she rolled her eyes.  Very professional.  So, I kindly go up to the manager and try to discuss the matter.  However, our kind conversation didn't stay kind because the manager was rude, incompetent, and down right unhelpful.  He goes to note in a condescending tone that I and my friends have been there before and they've always had this policy... but, I explained to him that was not the case because if I knew the policy that I would have not chosen the place for my birthday dinner because it's an inconvenience.  Going forward, I know now that this place is completely disrespectful and their \"split itemization policy\" is for their benefit, so they don't have to work.  So, if you're looking for over price, over salted food with a side of unhelpful, rude, and disrespectful service.. then Yama Izakaya is the place to go!  However, if you're smart... avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"The family and I decided to try a Japanese restaurant on our visit to Charlotte. After living in Japan for nearly eight years, we were intrigued by an Izakaya in Charlotte.  We were surprised upon arriving the location is in a strip mall. We could see it was in an up and coming neighborhood with all kinds of trendy establishments nearby.   The interior was well decorated. Aesthetically pleasing. We were immediately seated near the back of the restaurant. Our server took our drink and food orders and brought our drinks shortly thereafter. We ordered lamb yakitori, potato croquettes, tonkatsu, yaki udon, and teriyaki chicken.   The appetizers were delivered a short time before our meals. The lamb yakitori was tasty as were the croquettes. My son thought there was too much vegetables with his teriyaki chicken. It was a lot! The yaki udon was decent I guess. The tonkatsu was plentiful and delicious.  Overall we were pleased with our visit here. If we're in the area we would possibly dine here again.   Note: most of the employees seemed unhappy to be there. Thought it was strange."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the PORK BELLY SLIDERS! I keep thinking about them all the time. They literally melt in your mouth. The salmon sushi is great too. I hated the teriyaki chicken, but the teriyaki steak! Amazing. Prices are a bit too much for me too."}
{"text":"Very nice place in noda uptown charlotte. Good food. Very clean.  Limited menu on Sundays and weekdays.   Ramen dishes seem very popular here.  1. Grilled squid was good. $11 2. Pork belly was also good. Good with rice. $7 3. Chicken kasu was very good.  $ 14 Crispy outside. Used dark and white meat which brings more flavor. Loved it.   $2.50 for a very small side order of rice.    Hum...   4. Chicken kasu and rice is a little bit over priced but overall a nice place to visit."}
{"text":"This ramen was a joke. Our waitress told us it was Top Ramen, and I guess I had the creamy chicken flavored with what seemed like sliced lunchmeat in it (ordered the $13 Tonkotsu)  The waitress was not very pleasant after we questioned why they used such poor ingredients. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Decor very cute, swanky. Service 5 star!!!  Drinks unique and excellent. Yelling at staff head chef....yep they got one!! Lamb lollipops the size of actual lollipops....6 dollars each....that's there too.....!!?? Family style dishes for sharing....that won't fill a bird.....yikes.  its tapas... so dont go if you are hungry or make sure it's payday....I won't be back unless I am meeting someone for drinks. Im going for dinner where I get a meal after a long hard day."}
{"text":"Again by pluck & happenstance I've stumbled into a soft open and have been richly rewarded. This smaller, hipper edition of Yama will be for those in search of bold & experimental flavors. Do not come here for California rolls & Sapporo. Think quail egg, monkfish liver (the seafood equivalent of foie gras), and a wasabi raw octopus dish that's sublime in balancing flavor versus texture.  The decor is contemporary with elements of traditionalism. There are a few booths along the wall neatly separated by hanging thick strands of rope, primarily seating is tables with comfortable chairs at the bar meant for holding the human body for dining. It is not your typical Japanese restaurant in a strip shopping mall.  Like the food the bar has a focus of uniqueness and being different than surrounding offerings. Saki will be a strong point.  Food is split between small plates (where vegetarian choices are limited), yakitori, and entrees where ramen is featured. Depending on the small plate ordered you'll get 3-6 items so sharing is the goal. The pork belly is so good you may not want to. On a stick items come in 3s. Ramen lovers may no longer need to commute to Pineville as the broths are made each night for the next day and the deepness of flavor shows. The serving size is generous, so commit to 2-3 small plates or ramen. You'll be too full for all. Later look for a number of specials to capitalize on unique ingredients or the chef's creativity.  Prices are are reflective of the higher quality ingredients but not outrageously so. It's a step up in experience for the neighborhood but you won't feel it was overpriced."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times with friends! We absolutely love the food but the service is the worst I have ever seen! And I have given it chance after chance . The manager and the bartender always make you feel like your a bother . Ironically the wait staff Is very friendly and accommodating. They can have multiple tables vacant and tell you there's a wait with the whole restaurant half empty. It's amazing that the manager and the bartender never smile or make you feel welcome . Strange atmosphere , but great food."}
{"text":"Ramen is finally making its way to Charlotte and that makes me happy.  When I first moved to the QC in 2005 there was no ramen to be found and saying ramen got you odd looks, like you were referring to \"cup o noodle\" or something. I moved back to California and years later I am back in the QC again.. this time finding ramen is so much easier... and this is one of the great places to get it.  Back home in California there is a place called Noodle World.. nothing fancy.. it's good ramen though and you can always get in and chill with your friends.. this place reminds me of it.  I love the low key atmosphere, the decent prices, good drinks and YUMTASTIC ramen and other treats. I wish I could eat here more often, if I lived closer to this side of town I think I would be in here all the time. :)    When I was in Japan, our favorite place had one counter - no tables... just a single counter with seats and men making ramen in giant pots.. and it was AMAZING..  ever since that night I have been a ramen fiend... so it's comforting to know Charlotte is now a ramen city. :)  They have a lot of other great items - don't think if you don't like ramen that you can't come here. They have some sushi, tempura and other small plates. You will like it, try it!  *Slurp*"}
{"text":"Very good. Atmosphere waa nice and their small plates have a wide variety. I enjoyed the Ramen as well."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen places I have been to! Unlike may other ramen places, they give you a lot more pork belly. I really liked the pork belly here because it had minimal fat. The first time I came here, everything was spot on. The second time I came, my ramen was slightly salty. The Teriyaki Steak was kinda dry even though it was still pretty red. Could be the meat itself and not the sear though.   You've GOT to get those small dishes when you come, they're UHMAZINGGGG!! The grilled squid is phenomenal, takoyaki 10/10, etc... they are seasoned so well and melt in your mouth."}
{"text":"Was expecting a hibachi but was pleasantly surprised with a more authentic menu. They managed to improve a rather simple dish, teriyaki chicken. Probably the best I've had :)"}
{"text":"Been here twice, one of my new favorite places to eat in Plaza Midwood. First visit went with small bites. Finally a place nearby that carries okonomiyaki and takoyaki. We also had the Gyoza and Ebi Shumai. It's nice to have a different take on Japanese food than the tired, overdone and bland Hibachi grill, or the generic asian restuarant with Sushi.  On our second visit we both got ramen. I had the tonkostu, pork bone broth, which seems to be a less common offering. It was quite good (though I'd also recommend Musashi for it, that place is out of the way but so delicious). My girlfriend was quite happy with her ramen, and she is fussy about her Japanese food after having lived a couple of years in Japan. The ramen comes with all the standard toppings, and options of adding more if need, though I don't see why you would as it was already filling as it was.  My only complaint is that some of the items on the menu are light on descriptions. I can understand trying to keep it simple, but we watched an adjacent table go though probably 10 things on the menu asking for more information on what it was. They could also be a bit clearer that the extras column for Ramen is and addition by specifying what comes in the standard ramen order. You don't want a customer thinking they have to pay an extra $4 for pork (chashu? just call it pork or at least explain that means pork), when it comes with plenty to begin with."}
{"text":"Yama is one of those hidden gems in Plaza Midwood. The menu is extremely varied, but besides the ramen comes in a small-plate variety. The ramen is the star of the show here, with one of the creamiest broths I've ever had. The interior is immaculately decorated, and has a fully stocked bar with all of the essentials. If you're looking for a quieter, more romantic place in Plaza midwood this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Took my GF here, had a great time as we tried new things that you just don't see around Charlotte. Highlight of the night was the Korean Beef, stuff was amazing.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Spicy miso Ramen is one of my favorites. I love how they open so I can get great food late night. All of the yakitori is good, the pork belly bun is amazing. If you're into raw sushi, the jalapeño hamachi (yellowtail) is delicious with the ponzu sauce that they have with it. Always great service and management. This place definitely opened up a new world to me for Ramen."}
{"text":"Awesome experience.... The drinks have been great, the sushi was very fresh and they even allowed us to customize our rolls.  The salmon looks delicious and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place been on my bookmark list for a year now. And finally I have arrived!!!   Brian was our waiter. He was special, on point and his recommendations was awesome.   We ordered the following.. Don't judge. I wanted to try everything.   Pork Belly: yum and juicy  Asparagus wrapped in bacon: Asparagus was chewy so it was ok Scallops wrapped in bacon: soo delicate yet delicious  Seaweed salad: typical  Duck: yummmmmmm  Brussels Sprout: I'm crazy about Brussels but these have a more bitter aftertaste than most and better me I know Brussels. I ate for a year straight  And  Pork broth Ramen: I love it..   Everything was amazing.. worth the wait. Thank goodness it was crowded. We have a comedy show to go after. And to finish our great dinner.. Brian surprised us with a wonderful dessert on the house.. I mean I did spent $102 on just the two of us!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the ramen and we weren't disappointed. Bryan was our server and suggested we get the octopus balls to start which were AMAZING. Also Little did we know they did $5 hot sake on Wednesday's so that was an added plus. We both got the miso bowl and added sprouts and it was great. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Sigh... I so want to give this place 5 stars!! I love Yama Asian Fusian in South Park and I had really high expectations of their new restaurant. We came not long after they opened with the intent on trying some small bites and getting some ramen.  Small bites first:   Buta Kakuni (pork belly) this was really good. Cooked well but I prefer mine crispier on the outside. This was a little on the soggy side. Just a personal preference though, taste wise it was good!  The hamachi jalepenos were probably a 3-4/5 stars. I adore yellowtail but this pretty much left me underwhelmed.  Gyu Tataki (seared steak) was probably the best thing I ate all night!! Seriously I could eat nothing but a meal of this and some rice... very well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  Okonomiyaki (japanese pancake) I have no idea if this was how it was supposed to taste because I did not like it at all!! My friends said it was pretty good though.   Soba w/Anago minus the anago lol... This was a good dish however we got it about 10-15 minutes after we finished eating.   Gyoza was standard  Ramen:  I was not impressed. The noodles didn't seem to be cooked properly and were clumping together and not very slurpable (new word lol). The quality and flavor just seemed to be off. It definitely was not enough to get us to come there for ramen versus Musashi's.   Overall I would have given this place 4 stars except the service we had was actually kind of terrible. The guy managing the house was one of the servers from Yama and I remember him well. However he seemed overwhelmed. Again they are new so I was cutting them some slack. We needed a table for 3 and he said it would be a few minute wait for a table to leave and be cleared off so we went to the bar. A table left and no one had cleaned it off but they appeared busy. Another couple came in and a waitress went up to them and attempted to give them the table we were waiting on. At this point we'd been waiting for about 15 minutes staring at an empty dirty table for 10 of those minutes so we were a little peeved. I went up to her and said we've been waiting for that table for 10 minutes. The manager put our names on the list and she just completely ignored it. There were 2 person tables along the wall as well. She got really defensive and kind of nasty with me, again losing points. Our waiter came by eventually and could 100% not be bothered with us. He was not happy to be waiting on us and I think he may have been ill. He would disappear for long long stretches of time and it took FOREVER to get through this meal. About halfway through the meal after he had to go put a few of our items in for order because he forgot I saw him bookbag/takeout bag in hand leaving the restaurant. He never once told us he was leaving or said a word to us. Just left... The guy who took over was nice but clearly had not been updated on the tables. Again our previous waiter had supposedly put the rest of our order in and hadn't. Honestly with the service the way it was I'd give a normal restaurant 1 star... However I know the standards by which their other restaurant runs and I'm hoping this is just new restaurant issues that will be resolved. If I'm in the area I may stop in again for some small bites but will probably skip the ramen."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this great place. Fantastic food. Great ownership. The Pork Ramen is the best. I fell in love with Octopus Balls in Japan a few years ago and Yama has the best ones I've ever had. Order sashimi and it will be the best in town easily (shares with sister restaurant in Yama Southpark).  Every item on the menu is authentic, delicious, and never disappoints."}
{"text":"Japanese? I should have been! Tonight's soft opening brought some happiness to my belly.... Did I say Belly, yes, pork belly in the ramen with picked bamboo, picked egg, pork bone, and a 24 hour broth that was tasty..,, maybe a dash more salt could have added but then again, just grab the soy sauce. Along with that had the Shishito peppers, hamachi jalapeño and squid salad. Service had been great from entering to ordering, to cleaning up after my empty plates. 4 stars now I'm sure five after grand opening! Japanese tapas...such a thing? Yes, here it is happening here."}
{"text":"I'm thankful I got to try this place before it becomes that top spot in Charlotte and it becomes impossible to get in. I was able to walk in Friday night for a lovely dinner.  A lot to love here -from the decor, well-mixed drinks, fresh fish and RAMEN. Charlotte had a gaping bowl shaped hole and Yama Izakaya is here to fill that chasm with their ramen.  Is it the best I've ever had? Of course not. Is it dang good? Yup.  I split a bowl with a friend and the pork was so lovely.  Also tried the yellow tail collar (yum, pricey but so unlike anything you've recently eaten), Hamachi with jalapeño (uhuh, super fresh and well balanced) and the lamb lollipops (my only disappointment. $12 for two small pops).  Make your reservations now because this place is going to be like Soul was four years ago."}
{"text":"The restaurant has expanded it's menu for the new year and now has a full sushi bar! That's right, a full sushi menu is available along with your Japanese favorites. The nigiri is really, really reasonably priced. This is worth a second look if you haven't been in a while!"}
{"text":"It is as authentic as it comes. Small plates and ramen is what this fantastic gem in the rough has to offer. The interior is amazing, as was the food...and our server (Sarah with an \"h\") was on point every step of the meal and was outstanding! We had a variety of dishes - all of which were amazing. The miso ramen, tempura veggies, veggie dumplings, spicy beef yakatori, pork belly steam buns and some other great things! If you haven't been, go now...and visit the Natural Home Market next door, too."}
{"text":"Just ok. Ramen was subpar, cocktails poorly made, and the restaurant set-up odd with a ton of 4-person tables with only 2 patrons (we were asked to wait when there was clearly available space). Waitstaff were pleasant but for forgetful. All in, probably won't get return."}
{"text":"Forget that it's in a strip mall; this place is worth your time. Clearly, they are shooting for a swanky vibe, which I think they achieve. This is definitely a third date kind of place: mood lighting, great food textures, and a few laughs over chopstick faux pas. On top of that, the food was great. After the closing of Nom Nom Burgers, I've been desperate for a good bowl of ramen. I got it!  The pork broth ramen was excellent. My husband's fried noodles were good, too. And I could have had at least two more orders of the pork belly small bites. Try it; you'll like it."}
{"text":"I've only tried a few things here but thanks to the open kitchen and slow service, I don't think I'll be back again. We ordered a couple of the ramen and gyoza. The service was very slow and while we wait for our food, we got a chance to see how other foods were made. The fried octopus balls came straight from the package and into the fryer. As did the gyoza, again straight from a store brought package to the pan. When our food came out, the ramen noodle is very evident it was also store brought. Also saw the ice cream mochi dessert at the table next to us and all there was is a couple of store brought ice cream mochi and a few pocky sticks from the Asian market. Do yourself a favor, save your money by stopping by the Asian market and make yourself the same meal for less than half the price."}
{"text":"An excellent addition to Plaza Midwood. We went before the grand opening and were very impressed. The food is served in small portions / tapas style. Excellent flavors!  I understand the vibe and appreciate the Japanese drink selection but it would be great to see some local beers. The cocktail menu could use a little fine tuning, adding anything but Vodka! Yamazaki cocktails would be a great addition!   Lars was a great server!  We're excited to return!"}
{"text":"Mixed emotions here. Service was friendly, the location and atmosphere is nice, but the prices are absurd for the size and quality. We got a 6 piece tuna roll and each piece was no larger than a nickel size...pork belly buns were tasty though. In the end I'd rather go to Ru San's."}
{"text":"Every time I walk in, I'm greeted by friendly staff. If I lived closer I'd probably be a regular. As it is, the staff recognizes me & makes me feel like I'm at home. I'm always up for trying new things, and so I've almost always allowed the staff to surprise me with a fun cocktail or dish that they love. I'm never disappointed!  Edit: yelp asked me if they were good for kids. If your kids are picky eaters, no they're not. If you've always encouraged your children to experience tastes & textures to surprise they're palates, YES!"}
{"text":"Dined @ Yama Izakaya for the first time last night and sampled a handful of items.  Tonkostu Ramen --- below average. The egg was well seasoned but the broth didn't have enough flavor.    Pork Belly Buns --- super tender and flavorful, I would give it 5 stars if it had more pickled vegetables (acidity) to cut the sweetness of the sauce.  Lamb Cumin Skewers --- not the best I've had but I'd still recommend it.  Spicy Beef Skewers --- This packed a pretty good punch actually, I would give it 5 stars if the beef was a little more tender.    Hamachi Kama (grilled yellowtail collarbone) --- This was an off-menu special last night, and was the hands down star of the show.  First of all, the portion. This was the most generous portion I've ever had.  Second, the char / crispiness. This was superbly grilled!  I would come back for this alone (but would have the check that it's available as this is on special only).  Lastly, the server was very friendly and attentive.  The food is really 3 stars, elevated an extra half point for the awesome hamachi kama and another extra half point for the good service."}
{"text":"After last night's meal,  I am totally upset with myself for not visiting this place sooner! From the ambiance to the waiter and most important, the food.. this place is amazing! We started with drinks; long island iced tea top shelf for my gf and the Red Dragon martini for me.  Both drinks were amazing. The Red Dragon martini featured whole lychee fruit which was a special touch.  Now, on to the food. My gf started with the grilled Brussel Sprouts which were just the perfect balance of a charred outside and firm,  yet chewy inside splashed with soy sauce. I chose the braised pork belly buns and I'm going to tell you.. everything about it was wonderful! The pork was perfectly caramelized and tender, nestled in between pillow soft buns.  Next up was seafood ramen for my gf. What I loved is that although this wasn't on the menu,  the chef had no problem preparing it.  I had a Tonkatsu bowl and it was absolutely incredible! I can honestly say that this ramen featured one of the best broths that I've tasted this far.  I could really tell that the pork broth was truly homemade. No box broth here!   For wonderful ramen, great music and a cool, laid back atmosphere, do yourself a favor and visit!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 3.5 stars I would. The decor is decent and the staff is very friendly and nice. We had a party of 5 on a Saturday night and got seated quickly. We had a vegan and a gluten free member in our party and we were struggling to find something for either of them to eat. The server was knowledgable and helped us guide through the menu you be something that both could eat. However their experience was not that great.  I had the teriyaki chicken which was not bad and the shiitake mushrooms which are 3 skewers of 3 mushrooms each lightly toasted and then a dab of sauce on them. Not entirely worth it.   All in all its a good concept (tapas style Japanese) but for me it fell a little short on the options that we could eat."}
{"text":"First off I think it is hilarious that some people are taking off stars and confused about the ramen offerings here thinking that they needed to pay extra for noodles or adding in items and not ordering it at all instead of simply asking about it. Having eaten in ramen shops up and down the eastern and western coast I feel like I have to say this is simply how ramen is listed. Now on to the actual review.  Having drunken quite a fair bit and needing some food before resuming the aforementioned drinking fellow yelper Jonathon B. and I stumbled in here at around 9:30-10? for some grub. Well I have to say the place looks kinda cool, unfortunately we happened to be here at the worst possible time as a humongous group of people decided on this joint as the place to celebrate a birthday bash. Believe me it was highly annoying when all you can hear during a meal is constantly CHUG CHUG CHUG and FUCK YEAH BRO! Believe it or not it is okay to tell your guests to respect the other guests around them and stop yelling in your establishment.  Spying monkfish liver on the menu I went with it because who doesn't love the Foie gras of the sea as an appetizer! I regretted it. While the texture is excellent the pairing of salmon ikura on top leaves it tasting so fishy that the pool of vinegar at the bottom failed to brace it down to tolerable levels. I also tried some of my dining partner's beef negimaki. The beef is nice, the asparagus is well cooked, but the presentation makes it pretty hard to eat. Shortly afterwards our ramen came out though and it was pretty good! The broth is very porky, makes me wonder if they didn't do the traditional parboiling to neutralize some of that or something. Anyways I like it but some people may not. The side items strewn throughout the soup were adequate if not amazing. The extremely major flaw I actually pointed out to the server was that you have listed a flavored egg as an item in the soup but all we have gotten is a hard boiled egg cut in half. I was met with an actual shrug of the shoulders and an eh! Hey you asked how everything was girl! Seriously though this is not how you should respond to an honest critique, please train your waitstaff better.  In conclusion and the words of our server: eh *shoulder shrug*"}
{"text":"I've held off on going to Yama Izakaya for quite a while, unsure of the menu.  But, it was a cool night and I was craving some delicious ramen - so, we hopped in the car for a short trip the tiny strip mall in Plaza Midwood.    We arrived around 6:30 p.m. on a Tuesday night to a fairly empty restaurant.  Some restaurants in PM can be have later crowds, so while I was a bit surprised, we weren't deterred.  The venue is beautiful inside - very intimate and classy.    We started out with some wine, sake and shitake and spicy squid yakatori.  The shitake yakatori was tasty with a nice, savory/sweet sauce on it. The squid was quite spicy and over-cooked - little too chewy for my taste.    We both ordered bowls of ramen - I had the pork ramen, my partner order the spicy miso.  While they were (of course!) quite filling with noodles, some veggies and pork - the broths were not overly flavorful.  Perhaps I'm spoiled by another ramen place across town, but I wanted a bit more complexity to the flavor.    While it will do in a pinch, Yama Izakaya did not stand out as outstanding.  It was warming and filled a craving, but I don't imagine we'll be back on a regular basis - which I do find quite disappointing."}
{"text":"I always past by this place and kept saying I need to stop by and check them out. So one I was starving and they were close so I stopped in. The atmosphere is very nice. The staff was friendly.   I order the Japanese wing, lamb skewer, and miso ramen. Over all the food was good. There menu had a lot more I look forward to trying on my next visits. I really enjoyed the wings and ramen was done really well.  We sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks. I can't remember the drink I had but it was really good and citrus. The bartender was really nice and help with choosing drink options.  I say you should go by and check them out. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to eat in town. A Japanese small plates restaurant. I come here maybe 2-4 times a week after work to have a few small plates and a glass or two of Sapporo. I've been a customer since day one so maybe my review is a bit more biased. I love the staff! I am always treated like family. The owner somehow always manages to come by and tell me hello as I enjoy my meal. The bartenders and waiters/waitresses are bright and know the menu, even if some items seem foreign to the customer.   Izakaya is a specific restaurant that serves small plates meant to share (kind of like Dim Sum) and drink A LOT of beer. Of course, you can order the ramen (which both Tonkotsu and Miso are delicious) and other entrees but the Japanese Tapas is where it really shines. I have had every item on that menu. My favourites are pork belly cuts, takoyaki, yellowtail collar, okonomiyaki, and basically all of their skewers.   The restaurant has a slightly intimate ambiance from the furniture and dim lighting but the music at some times can throw off the mood. The place is great for a date or even just post work meal with a good friend.   ALSO! They serve Hitachino Nest which is a Japanese beer. Sapporo and Asahi are your bud lights but if you really want to treat yourself to some Japanese craft beer, those are the way to go. Extremely hard to find brews. The White ale, red bean ale, and Espresso Stout are a must try.  LASTLY! They serve Authentic Japanese Whiskey and a HUGE variety of Sakes. The Sake from Fukushima is delicate and smooth. It runs down like water so be careful. I didn't know I was tipsy until I tried to stand up. Cheers everyone!  **At the bottom of the menu, it says that the check is split evenly and has an automatic charge for gratuity for large parties. Some extra info in case someone gets upset for not looking at their policy."}
{"text":"Good place to drink and have light meal with friends.  Their yakatori and ramen is great."}
{"text":"Very impressive restaurant! Beautiful interior. The ramen is to die for , I ordered the Tonkostu (pork bone) ramen which was very tasty and flavorful! The service was awesome and staff is friendly. My new favorite place to get ramen."}
{"text":"I would like to give 4 stars for this restaurant. The best ramen I had so far in Charlotte. As an expert in Chinese and Japanese food and already tried 100+ different Chinese and Japanese restaurants in US, I have to say the ramen in this restaurant is authentic.  As I mentioned in my other reviews, there are 3 main factors of a ramen: Broth, Noodles, Side dishes. The key of a good ramen is all about the BROTH! I tried the Tonkotsu broth which is flavorful, rich and creamy. The best thing is the noodle fully absorbed the flavour from the broth.  The noodles are pretty good, they have a springy texture. One more thing I would like mention is for noodles, good or bad is mastered in Chef's hands. Noodles should not be too hard or too soft but just right!   The side dishes for ramen are superb. They added bamboo shoots, bean sprouts and onsen eggs etc. I do appreciate they go with a very traditional way on the side dishes. This is the authentic ramen I want.  One happy suprise from this restaurant is their small bites. Most of them are pretty decent and tasty.  Above all, I do recommend this restaurant for ramen lovers!"}
{"text":"Dined here on their grand opening night. The decor is dark and authentic to what I think a Japanese tapas bar would be. Fully stocked bar with lots of sake, cocktails and beer--plus a couple of wine choices.Bartenders were attentive and asked for our feedback on the cocktails. We sampled a couple of the pass-around food as well as ordered from the menu. Everything we had was tasty--edamame, yellowtail with jalapeños, bacon wrapped asparagus, mushrooms, grilled steak and the dumplings. I also ventured out and tried the monkfish liver and pickled octopus-- interestingly tasty . This is a great addition to the Plaza Midwood area. Stop in and enjoy the authenticity that the owner and his wife have brought to Charlotte. I look forward to coming back and trying the ramen and other tapas dishes."}
{"text":"I'm an izakaya novice and ignoramus.  In fact, Yama was only the second restaurant I've ever been to that labels itself as such.  The first was one that the wife and I visited a few years back in Vancouver, and that was one of the better restaurant experiences we've had in the last several years.  So Yama had a lot to live up to, and given Vancouver's status as an Asian-food mecca, I wasn't expecting all that much out of an \"izakaya\" in a strip center in Charlotte, at least by comparison.    But Yama was not bad.  Not bad at all.  First off, the centerpiece of the meal, tonkatsu ramen, wasn't the greatest.  I'm also a relative ramen novice.  I've seen the on-line arguments about whether ramen or pho is better, and as somebody's who's had boatloads of pho over the years, I'd vote for the latter.   Yama's ramen didn't do anything to tilt the balance in my mind. The broth in Yama's tonkatsu was a little lackluster, but it was still a hearty, satisfying bowl of soup.  (All that said, I'm confident I've yet to experience great examples of ramen.)  Yama scored higher points on the izakaya stuff:  For instance, cumin lamb skewers from the yakitori menu were robustly seasoned and just about perfectly cooked.  Wasabi tako, which is small bits of raw octopus in a light wasabi sauce, had a delicious balance of salt, vinegar, and heat.  I feel like we had a third thing, but can't remember--either way, those first two were worthwhile enough!  Yama has a dark and cavernous feel--and as you might expect, its decor tends toward the slick, modern, and urbane--but it was comfortable with not-annoying noise levels.  Service was fine on this not-very-busy evening."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to coming here and came on a mission to try steamed pork belly buns and ramen.  We showed up on a Friday night around 8pm.  Place was pretty quiet and empty and ambience-wise less than I expected.  Our waitress was super sweet and nice and explained anything we needed to know about the menu.  We ordered the pork belly steamed buns, fried squid legs, octopus balls and pork ramen.    The fried squid legs were underwhelming- not much flavor and no flavorful sauce for them.  They were pretty good on their own but I wish there was a good garnish or sauce for them.  Octopus balls were gross.  Didn't know what to expect honestly but the texture was mushy and mysterious, and I was looking forward to the rubbery, smooth octopus texture.    Pork belly buns were good but again, underwhelming.  Pork belly itself was good but that was all that was on the bun.  I had high expectations because I tried my first pork belly bun at Futo Buta and it was amazing so I hoped this would be as good or better.  Ramen was good but again, not the best!  The ingredients themselves in the bowl looked dull and unappetizing.  Especially the poached egg that was seemingly grey.  Noodles themselves were very thin and overdone in my opinion.  The ramen at Futo Buta was thicker with a nicer bite to it, and the broth wasn't as thick but had more flavor.  Overall, a good place if you want to satisfy a ramen craving, but I don't think I'll be back as long at Futo Buta is around."}
{"text":"Must try the pork ramen!  The broth is out of this world.  Was not a fan of the pancake...too fishy for me.  Great atmosphere.  The sake nigori and the blueberry mojitos were delicious.  I'm going to introduce everyone I know to this place!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first experience here. Restaurant interior is quite nice, subtle, and casual. Quality of our food was up to standards considering the prices they were charging $$. Short wait for our food. Appealing and simple food presentation. Wait staff wasn't bad, but wouldn't say the greatest. Osaka roll was so tasty! Majority of the time (almost always) my boyfriend refuses to eat anything raw, but he actually opened up to the Osaka roll and loved it! Overall, I really enjoyed the Osaka roll, crunchy roll, fried squid tentacles, and spicy miso!"}
{"text":"Best Ramen in town. Try the Tonkatsu.   Casual, fun atmosphere. The Octopus balls are 100% authentic Japanese street food.   Love the tuna salad. It is basically seared sushi wrapped delicately in lettuce with ponzu sauce. Delicious!  The Gingertini is a bit sweet but addictive.  Great selection of sake   Try the Japanese sodas with the ball in the bottle."}
{"text":"As this is the second ~fancy, trendy~ ramen place that I have tried, I have shortly realized the complexity and variety of flavors and ingredients that a similar chicken-broth ramen (Shoyu or Shio) can have.  Before I get into that, Yama Izakaya has a great ambiance, a big space with lots of seating, has outdoor seating, and a parking lot with ample parking (which is a huge plus!). I went on a Sunday night and there was no wait at all. The wait staff is very friendly and quick and they have many options on their menu (ranging from various appetizers to sushi, to ramen, to general soups and salads).  I started my meal off with a simple ginger salad and it was AMAZING. I absolutely love ginger dressing and I am not exactly sure what secret extra ingredient or spice they added to theirs (some extra soy component), but it left me wanting much more! My friends decided to get miso soup and sushi, which both looked and tasted great!  For ramen, I ordered their Shio (salted chicken) ramen with no extra added on. Their broth was much lighter and less greasy than Futo Buta's which was a nice surprise (I would highly recommend adding the chili oil and red flakes to the broth, which adds an amazing depth of flavor). Similar to what other Yelp reviewers have said, they need to work on their noodles. They have a very similar taste and feel to a generic ramen $1 package at any grocery store, which made me realize how important noodles were to my ramen experience. Also, I wish they either added more ingredients to their bowl or changed out what they add on for better options (the toppings didn't really add much to the flavor). Also, their pork belly is sliced thin and has barely any fat on it which can either be a good or bad thing depending on your tastes and preferences.   After a lot of thought, in my opinion, it is very difficult to compare Futo Buta's and Yama Izakaya's ramen as they are both great but very different depending upon what you like/feel important is for your ramen experience. If you enjoy a lot of broth with your ramen that is light, a little on the salty side, and do not care too much about the noodles texture or toppings than I would 5/5 recommend Yama Izakaya for you as their broth will easily leave you satisfied! However, if you enjoy more heavy and earthy broth and care more about the thicker/soft noodles and included additional toppings, than I would head over to Futo Buta!"}
{"text":"My husband, friend and I stopped by this place this evening for an early dinner after a few drinks at Common Market and we are so glad that we did. We started with appetizers. We weren't into anything greasy but we were very happy to find many options. We started with the seaweed salad which was fresh, crunchy and delicious. The second appetizer was edemame, which was classic and high quality with the perfect amount of salt. Third was the steamed shrimp dumplings, which were incredibly flavorful. The best part was definitely the Tonikotsu Ramen. It was delicious and flavorful. The egg was such high quality that the yolk was bright and the bone broth was incredible and rich.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Third time round and I'm not sure where I stand with this place. The last two times we visited I ordered the ramen noodles and was.pretty happy. However things are never the same from one visit to the next. Last time there was no meat in the soup this time there was. Last time they gave an assortment of fresh veggies this time only a heaping hand full of canned bamboo shoots. Really? The pork broth is my favorite by far but I feel like I never know what to expect. They also do not allow for call in orders or takeout. You are asked to order your food and then box it yourself if you want to take it home. Strange!! I really wish they would turn down the extreamly loud music and realize they are not a uppity night club."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night with my mom and a few aunts, it was our first time. I liked how they weren't super busy so we were seated right away. I love how calming and chill the atmosphere is and OMG THE TOILET!! It's literally a seat warmer so cool!! Anyways I ordered the veggie potstickers which were good, it was soft and yummy but the main spotlight goes to the ramen! I'm so sold, I had the veggie ramen and it was BOMB. It had a variety of veggies, the flavor was all there and the best part was it wasn't too salty like all the ramen I've had in the past. I'm definitely coming back here from now on to get my ramen as \"a regular\"(:"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST Japanese authentic food here in Charlotte. In Japan izakayas (pubs) are known to be places for people to drink and eat, and the same applies here. Although a bit pricey (compared to Japan, but makes sense for america), the food is phenomenal and very authentic. While my friends and I were there we got a bunch of small plates and then split the bill, which is how it usually works in Japan. The okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and the grilled squid are great. The taco wasabi is good, but don't order it if you aren't familiar with it, its more of an acquired taste. And the yakitori are superb. I've been to Japan, and have been to plenty of izakayas, and Yama Izakaya has met my expectations on terms of food and taste. I plan to visit again soon to try their ramen. If you're looking for a place to have a legit real Japanese experience and have real Japanese food while enjoying a few drinks with friends , I would highly recommend this place. Thanks Yama Izakaya."}
{"text":"The first 2-3 times, amazing food. Since then though, the food has been inconsistent, a lot of the apps all just taste of the same old fryer oil and nothing else. For what they charge, I don't demand perfection, but it would be nice to at least have consistency. Sometimes the ramen broth tastes of nothing, other times it's so salty that you don't eat it. Also, I have a sneaking suspicion that they hold \"reserved\" tables for imaginary customers so that people that are waiting will spend money at the bar during their wait and, when they do, they all of a sudden get sat at a reserved table. That's happened to my group twice now, the third time we didn't want drinks, waited for an absurd amount of time while 3 tables sat empty, and then left and went next door and had a great meal. I'd recommend yama for a delivery/takeout situation if you're in dire need of some ramen, otherwise try other options."}
{"text":"Literally my new favorite restaurant. Beyond exceeded my expectations. Unbelievably tasty and amazing. Had the pork belly buns. Fried chicken wings. Seared steak. Fried Octopus. The crunchy roll. Tuna salad. Chicken skewers. Man this place rocks. Our server was awesome too!"}
{"text":"The Tonkotsu Ramen is beautiful. I came with Japanese people who say that Yama Izakaya closely resembles actual Japanese food, such as okonomiyaki and takoyaki. They were satisfied, and my tongue danced with joy upon contact with the fatty chasu soaked in delicious tonkotsu broth. The noodles were also a great texture and the toppings were perfect. There was a special tempura ice cream that temporarily took me to another world. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants something different than Americanized Japanese food."}
{"text":"For our boys night out wanted to try the tapas at this place. They were very good.   We had the pork belly skewers,  the duck negi, croquettes,  edamame,  crunchy roll galbi. It was all very good and the wait staff was on point"}
{"text":"Place is deece.  Nothing to talk about.  Would not come if you're thinking ahead of a place to go.  If you're driving around and you're close or want something close I would come here.  Nothing noteworthy about this place.   Also nothing particularly bad to note.  Mon/Tue place.  Not Fri/Sat."}
{"text":"I love all the yama restaurant.  Is all Japanese profile, Izakaya is probably the one I go to the most because is good for everyday and my wallet.  The ramen is good anytime especially for winter.  Best Japanese street food in NC in my opinion"}
{"text":"This place doesn't split your check and doesn't care to split your check, so I paid literally DOUBLE of what I'm supposed to, AND their service is SLOW, food is extremely mediocre AND OVERPRICED.  DO NOT come here and waste your money.  I've been to places that have WAY better food, service, and price, and those places will split your checks.  If I can give NO star I will give ZERO star"}
{"text":"Went to Yama with a bunch of friends.   Like many reviews, a lot of people have seen Yama but never tried.  Go and try as fast as you can.  This is a great place with really good food.  The service was great and our waitress was very friendly.     We tried various dishes and can't wait to go back and try more.  Among the dishes were the grilled squid, lamb and pork belly yakatori.  All were good but my favorite was the lamb.  We finished the night with bowls of Raman which didn't disappoint.  Tonkostu and Shio were the choices and both were good.    Overall it was a great experience and will be back."}
{"text":"So I was mad pumped about having a ramen house in the neighborhood ... and it was dope on the more over. Good size portions, yummy broth, great hot sake. A few downfalls: My dinner partners food (chicken something or other with noodles - not 100% sure) was way less than good - like way less than good. The server was obviously super new at the game and wicked nervous. He came to the table 9 million times - but I get that... 1st day on the job. I didn't like that the things that we ordered were one price on the menu and another price on the bill (every item we ordered).  I do look forward to returning to try something new very soon but I hope that it is a little more smooth the next time I stop in. As they are very new I am sure that the kinks are still being worked out. I say try it for sure.... It was a great rainy day choice."}
{"text":"There really aren't any places in the immediate Plaza Midwood area like Yama Izakaya.  It's cool decor and lounge music set up the atmosphere for a perfect place to have dinner with a date, a group of people, or just sit alone at the bar.  Let's start with the drinks.  The Sake choices are pretty extensive and quite honestly, I don't know what most of them are...be sure to tell the bartender what you like so you can get a recommendation!  If you're not in a Sake mood, they have a full bar and a few wines by the glass.  If you're up for an app, please do yourself a favor and get the chicken wings.  They are actually dry on the outside (not the oily or greasy kind) and moist on the inside, so it's not your typical wing.  The beef negamaki is always a winner too.  Gyoza is pretty standard.  Entrees are a toss up.  They have teryaki chicken and steak...sauce is decent and the cook/temp on the food is always perfect.  But really, the winner at Yama is the Ramen.  I've had a few types and they just knock it out of the park.  Possibly the best Ramen in Charlotte.  The portions are fairly sizable.  Be prepared to take some of your meal home.  This place is never crowded.  Why?  I have no idea.  It's a great spot with great food.  I recommend Yama if you're in the mood for something different and you're in the Plaza area."}
{"text":"Started the experience with a cup of green tea. The tea was room temperature and with a little honey it added the sweetness I was looking for. Also added a small bite of Buta Kakuni (braised pork belly). It was soaked in a ginger type sauce. It was good.   Ordered the Tonkostu (pork bone broth). This was amazing!! This is what made my experience. The pork broth soup has been simmering for about 12 hours. Very flavorful that came with a creamy base. On top was braised pork belly that were sliced very thin. Along with the pork came bamboo shoots, half of a hard boiled egg, and the ramen noodle.  The ramen noodle had a good texture. The noodle soaked up the pork broth sauce well. I also ordered extra noodles in my dish and it was very filling!   If you are looking for a new restaurant in the Charlotte area and looking for that Ramen fix, I would highly suggest this place. It is worth the $14 for a bowl of Ramen soup. Next time I would like to try the Soba Noodles."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! And I forgot to take pictures! :(  Yellowtail with citrus amd jalapeño: check Cumin lamb: check  Gyoza: delish  Shumai: :D Seared steak: !!! Negi yakitori: twas fabulous!!!   Someone had a fish jaw that was so tender and moist and full of flavor with the perfect amount of char flavor, another had the eel which he loved and I would never try, two of us had delish Tontsoku and a good bottle.of sake to wash it down.  Some people really gave yama izikaya bad reviews and I cannot understand why. There was absolutely nothing not to love. Even the atmosphere and decor WINS  love love love it  Can't wait to return and introduce this gem to some friends. Worth it in so many ways."}
{"text":"The food at Yama Izakaya is good but not great. I do love the atmosphere of the restaurant. There is lounge-like seating area at the front and a nice bar area. Our waiter was also very good.  Tonkostu Ramen: 3.5 stars. The broth was delicious; rich but not too viscous. The thin noodles were great. I liked the egg and bamboo shoots as well. However, I thought the pork chashu was mediocre at best. The chashu was thinly sliced and lacking flavor. I think they should drop the fishcake altogether as it makes the ramen bowl appear low quality.  Takoyaki Octopus balls: 4 stars. I really enjoyed the takoyaki. The octopus balls were flaky on the outside and flavorful inside.  Osaka sushi roll: 3.5 stars. This could easily be a great Sushi roll if they would only add avocado or cucumber. There are some scallions sprinkled on top of the roll but the roll still tasted incomplete from a texture and flavor standpoint. The seared tuna and flaky tempura desperately need smooth avocado to balance out the roll. I thought it was strange that they had a completely separate sushi menu.  Spicy cumin lamb yakitori: 3.5 stars. The lamb was decent. It was rather heavy on the cumin but I did not find the lamb spicy. The meat was a bit chewy.  Duck negi yakitori: 3.5 stars. the duck was tasty but I didn't care much for the sauce on the skewer which tasted like barbecue sauce."}
{"text":"Love this place. Ramen here is by far the best in town. Not so rich and heavy but rather full of flavor without being overwhelming. Checkout this hot spot out!"}
{"text":"Truly incredible tonkotsu Ramen, great octopus balls and delicious duck Negi. Oh my God I love this place so much Update: went again 6/08/17 just as great! Nice to get truly authentic  \" Izakaya\" style food. am so tired of all the NC faux hibachi style places ....plus the chef worked at my favorite NYC izakaya's....which is like a Japanese pub"}
{"text":"This place gave us high hope and left us feeling a little lack luster. (We may be unfairly comparing this to all the delicious ramen we had in Japan.) It was o.k., not amazing, not great. Service was attentive but almost too much so. We got two appetizers, two drinks, and two bowls of ramen, with tip it totaled over 70 bucks. Hard to swallow when you can get so much better ramen in Japan for under $30. But alas this is the U.S. and not Japan, but I think there are more complex broths to be found at better prices. It's a decent place for some good food and an o.k. date night."}
{"text":"Yama is inside a plaza. One couldn't expect it since the place is quite lovely, spacious, and Charlotte casual.   First thing I ordered was the Ika Sugatayaki (whole grilled squid). I get this appetizer pretty consistently at every Japanese restaurant, and for me, the Ika was cooked properly, very tasty in fact. That immediately got Yaka a 4 star! What pushed it to 5 was the pork bone broth! The ramen was delicious delicious. A very filling lunch at 6 after not having my lunch at 2 p.m.  Also use the bathroom after, they've installed a Japanese style toilet which in my opinion every household should have!"}
{"text":"Great food, good value, good service.  If you're looking for something that is different from your normal routine and don't want to break the bank, this is the place."}
{"text":"Amazing service and delicious tapas!  Will definitely be returning.  Had the cumin lamb, New York strip, hamachi jalapeño and tonkatsu ramen very very delicious! Had their special hamachi kama also it was okay I would've just stuck with the regular hamachi jalapeño."}
{"text":"I am not a Klingon. The lighting was dim at the bar - I had to whip out my iPhone flashlight to review the menu. I asked the bartender for a plate of edamame to start since I \"supposed I needed some vegetables.\" Bartender then suggests I order the shishito peppers. I asked how hot they are and he replied that maybe one in ten have some heat but they're very flavorable. So, being in an adventurous mood I agreed. A few minutes passed and the bartender brought the plate of peppers. The food was moving. Surely my eyes are playing tricks on me! So I quickly turned on my flashlight. The food was in fact moving. I am not a Klingon so this disturbed me in a fundamental way and so I quickly summoned the bartender. \"It's moving.\" He held up his hands - smiling - and said \"no, no! I promise you it's not alive!\" Turns out, the peppers are cooked in oil, sprinkled with sea salt and then topped with shaved, dried fish flakes. The fish flakes react to the hot oil and literally move. After the initial shock of moving food, I did muster up the courage to try a pepper and thought it was really good! The peppers had lots of flavor, saltiness, slight fish flavor - not overwhelming. I will order them again - hopefully when I'm with an unsuspecting companion.... Oh, and by the way, I did come across the \"one in ten\" hot peppers - hot but not killer.  Yama Izakaya has a very limited wine offering but the Chardonnay I ordered was fine. They are more of a sake and beer place anyway. I ordered the cumin lamb skewers which I felt were somewhat over cumin-ed which took away from the flavor of the lamb. The third dish I had were the fried dumplings stuffed with chicken and pork. They were my favorite.  I will definitely return to try other items on their menu especially the ramen bowls."}
{"text":"Menu selection was weak. Don't think you are getting sushi or hibachi. All management will say is you should have gone to our sister restaurant in South Park. No thanks..."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful meal tonight with my daughters. Attentive service, beautiful space, and varied menu. Our favorite menu item? Bacon wrapped asparagus. Smoky, bacon goodness. And since asparagus is included, it must be good for you, right? The seaweed salad was well-seasoned. Tasty tempura, well-done dumplings, and al-dente ramen rounded out a great meal. Looking forward to trying more of the yakitori. So pleased to see another great addition to our neighborhood's restaurant scene."}
{"text":"Had some edamame, a beer special, and spicy ramen! It was great! Loved the food and the atmosphere! Will def. go back during the winter."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend. He said the ramen soup here is delicious. But it is not good at all. The food here is just not good. I give them 2 stars for their nice interior design and very patient waiter.  The cooks inside the kitchen was so mad it seemed like that they don't want to work. heir toilet seats are from Japan.   The food is just not good and it is over price. I don't care how nice your restaurant is, but if you can't cook good food don't expect to charge so much."}
{"text":"Omg! We ordered three bowls of tonkotsu, edemame, and squid salad.  Everything was so delish! Service was great and good came out quickly.  I like the way the restaurant is decorated, but I don't like how we sit right next to strange patrons.  I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"As an Asian(Chinese), this restaurant just satisfied my taste. The Tonkutsu ramen is great and the Edamame is also great!"}
{"text":"Definitely not worth having dinner here, a drinks and quick appetizer place at best!  I was very excited to find out that this place was moving into the neighborhood after I read the menu from their other location.... Unfortunately, it has been a disappointment. :(  First of all, they don't serve sushi here (only at their other location).  Big mistake in this neighborhood.  We ordered the hamachi jalapeño, the chicken negi, a ramen bowl, bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms, fried oysters, Gyoza, the buta kakuni, and a few cocktails.  The only thing worth ordering (and paying for!) is the hamachi jalapeño and the specialty ginger cocktail.  Everything else (each time we've visited) has been lackluster and a waste of money, especially compared to other competitive restaurants in the area.  After our 2nd bad experience here, we've decided not to go back. Why waste any more time or money? There are FAR better places to eat in close proximity."}
{"text":"The place was nice service was good but when it comes to the food it leaves you wanting more flavors the ramen I got was ok nothing special the egg was over cooked the broth was probably the best part of the ramen noodles were decent my son got the yokisoba noodles and he didn't like them at all now would I come here again sure but it wouldn't be a place I would say go for the ramen or yakisoba noodles"}
{"text":"This food was absolutely delicious. I ordered udon and my two friends both ordered ramen. We all thought it was very tasty. Honestly I will be dreaming about it until I come again. My only complaint is its a little pricey for my budget but definitely worth it.  Also, so pleased to find the heated fancy toilet in the women's bathroom. This certainly elevated my experience."}
{"text":"Meh. This is very disappointing to me. It's in a great location, has a really nice atmosphere, and a very creative menu. The only problem is the food is really not that good. I had really high hopes for the Beef Negimake, which has asparagus, scallions and meat, three things I love. It was underwhelming. Not a lot of flavor. The Vegetarian Gyoza may as well have been vegan gyoza; it had almost no taste and was chewy, not the right consistency. I shouldn't have ordered the potato croquettes. They were not good at all! Even the iced tea was bitter. In a city with lots of choices, and Asian Fusion on every third block, you are better off going elsewhere. Pei Wei would've been a better choice."}
{"text":"Ramen was lacking in flavoring, was not impressed. All the yakitori/appetizers wasn't bad though. Was impressed that they even have the wasabi tako here since I've only seen them available in Japanese restaurants in bigger cities. We ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen and the first sip wasn't bad. Afterwards it was super bland and tasteless. At least work on the presentation of the ramen bowl if your flavoring is bland!  Service as good though. We had a homeless guy came wandering in the restaurant and was bugging us during our dinner. (Restaurant is located in a sketchy strip mall) The waitstaff handled it very well and apologized to us for his interruption. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"This place wasn't so bad. The ramen was definitely filling and came with a lot of stuff in it so you don't really need extra things in it. Just to let you know there's already two eggs in it. The blueberry mojito was also very good except sometimes the mint would block the straw so it was harder for me to drink. I think the appetizers were better than the ramen. I forgot what its called but one of the meat is wrapped around avocado and its delish! The appetizers with the fish flakes are really good! Plus the fish flakes move (picture worthy)."}
{"text":"Think of this place as more bar than restaurant. Their sake list is solid, they have a great selection of Japanese beers, and the yakitori skewers and small plates go so well with both. I've now tried all of their ramen offerings and it's hard to choose a favorite. The pork bone broth is very rich (and delicious) so go with the vegetarian or chicken if you want to keep it on the light side.  Several friends and I were delayed on a return flight and we stopped in here around 10pm for dinner. It was great to be able to order off the full menu so late at night during the week. A great addition to Plaza Midwood!"}
{"text":"Went here last night. Well tried to go here for national ramen day. I was so looking forward to eating some ramen. But when I arrive they told us that they close at 11:00 and last call was at 10:30pm.   I told them their website said they close at 11:30. They told me that I should have called. Then I told them I called and their answering machine said they close at 11:30 as well.   Needless to say the I was unable to eat a delicious bowl of ramen.   The owner there should really be up on their business"}
{"text":"The tonkostu was not very good at all. The broth was very plain. BLAND. Had to add a lot of chili powder and oil."}
{"text":"could say more about this wounderful place, evreything is so delicious especially the ramen. i would definately come back for it."}
{"text":"Good place to go if you like ramen offered in places like NYC. The broth is good but the noodles could be better. I would highly recommend the bacon wrapped enoki (mushroom) as an appetizer. I'm glad to see a place like this open up in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good food. Yelp photos really helped us with our ordering. Shout Ramen gets a A+. And that toilet..... Can you say awesome!!!  First timer using a Japanese toilet."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends, late on a Friday night. We started off with a few small plates. Takoyaki (Octopus Balls), Squid Legs, and Edamame. The Octopus Balls looked good, but I personally didn't enjoy the taste or texture. Squid legs were seasoned pretty well and were tasty. For my main entree, I ordered Chicken Katsu, its crispy fried dark meat, with a side of rice and some dipping sauce. Food was too dry for me to enjoy it. We finished off with some Mochi ice cream which was really satisfying. Willing to try this place again."}
{"text":"Yayyy! Plaza Midwood has a new restaurant. They are having their grand opening on 10/17 and said that there will be free bites- so check it out.  First of all- THANNK YOU. Thank you for taking a risk and opening in PM's awkward strip mall. This strip mall has improved so much in the past few years. It is really awesome to see businesses going in there.   We ordered the bacon wrapped asparagus and squid for starters. The asparagus was green asparagus and white asparagus (nice touch).  They were good. I wasn't blown away, but definitely tasty.   We also ordered the pork ramen. THAT MY FRIENDS is delicious. The pork is marinated in teriyaki sauce and it the broth is made over a ridiculous amount of time (8 hours? Something like that). I really want to try the miso and the chicken ramen. I have big plans for eating plenty of ramen this winter. The portion was so large that I have plenty for lunch today. We were stupidly confused by their menu. When it says \"extra\" they mean \"you already have this, but if you want to pay extra for a another egg it is....\". That was our fault, but just wanted to give a heads up to anyone else who also my struggle with reading menus.  Overall, the place is delicious. I think the prices a little high, but not too high to come back. I am interested in trying more of their small bites."}
{"text":"I guess I was expecting some sashimi options, but once I understood the concept I was happy.  An izakaya (???) (Japanese: [izakaja], ee-zah-ka-yah) is a type of informal Japanese gastropub. They are casual places for after-work drinking. They have been compared to Irish pubs and early American saloons and taverns. (from wikipedia)  The food I got was well prepared and came out quickly.  The portions were good. The staff was very nice and they have Sapporo and Asahi on tap as well as other options.  The guy next to me ordered Ramen and I am definitely getting that next time!  I had the Bao Buns and a roll with salmon which was delicious.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had a bit of a strange experience here for a late night dinner. The food was OK, the service a little spotty and the management helpful. My group of three walked in on a Saturday night and we were asked to wait in the lounge (aka the couches to the side) while they prepared a table for us. A little strange since there were several empty bussed tables throughout the dining area. I think the manager saw my dour look after we waited 15 minutes and had the host wipe down a table for us. Which obviously could have been wiped down 15 minutes earlier.  We split a round of edamame - which was delicious. Our drinks were originally sent to the wrong table but we were able to flag down the man with the drinks after the table next to us sent him away. My lychee martini was super strength but nicely cut with the sweetness of the lychee, 5 stars for my drink.  The waitress came back to let my sister know they were out of salmon (that seems like a pretty large flaw for a restaurant selling sushi, and to know only 20 or so minutes after we ordered). She said tuna was fine in its place and received her roll soon after. She finished her roll before the other two of us had any food or a check in from our waitress. We waited patiently sipping our martinis craning our neck for any sign of food from the kitchen for a while.   To his credit when the manager came around to ask how our meal was and found only 1/3 of us could answer he did whatever he needed to do, and offered us dessert on the house. The food came out almost immediately after. My tonkatsu ramen was lukewarm when it arrived and the flavor was bland. Maybe it had been sitting out a while but it wasn't the hot amazing broth I was craving on that frosty night.   I was on the fence between 2 stars for the experience or bumping it to 3 because of management's attentiveness. At the end of the day there's no reason for me to return and the feeling I left was \"meh\" so 2 stars it is."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here at least half a dozen times since they have opened.  We really enjoy the smaller portions (kind of like appetizers).  As we like to order a variety of food to share until we are full vs. the typical huge portions that we never fully eat (even as leftovers).  The Food has always been good sometimes great but the inconsistency is kind of annoying.  Normally we get the Asparagus wrapped in Bacon, Scallops wrapped in bacon, Gyoza, Spicy beef, tempura and on some occasions ramen.  The chicken gizzards were tough and overcooked definitely not an item  to order again.  Typically we come here at least once a month or so.  In every case we have always sat away from the window into the kitchen.  On our New Year's Eve visit we were sat at the table directly in front of the kitchen window.  BAD MOVE!!!  My wife sat facing the window and I sat facing the front of the restaurant with my back to the window.  After we placed our order my wife started giving me real-time commentary of the activities of the wait staff and kitchen staff.  Remember this is all in the same prep area for meals going out to customers.  Here is a quick summary:  - About 4-5 employees eating in full view of the window all off two or three plates - These same employees licking their fingers, touching plates and rubbing their faces with their hands - One particular employee washing dishes, going back to eating as well as preparing meals for customers.  I get that employees get hungry during their shift but having them eat in full view of customer's is a poor practice IMO.  In general if there is a window like this for customer's to see what/how the kitchen is run please make sure that they do behave in a professional manner.  Upon our departure we did let the host know of my wife's observations.  He apologized and appeared to be genuinely upset and concerned.  If this is truly supposed to be a high end restaurant they may want to get the kitchen staff at least some uniforms/smocks.  At this point I'm not sure if we are going to go back or not but I hope they truly take this feedback to enhance this area of concern."}
{"text":"It is  so good. The pork bun is so soft and tasty. We do not have to go New York anymore."}
{"text":"Not your typical Japanese restaurant...  Since this is a japanese restaurant that doesn't serve mainly sushi and hibachi there are  menu items that are pretty unfamiliar to a lot of people, but there are still lots of options that aren't as exotic. You can be pretty adventurous or go pretty plain and have a delicious meal either way.   I tend to enjoy the more exotic side of the menu and stay away from things like gyoza, edamame, yellowtail with jalapeno and ponzu, tempura, tori kara-age - fried popcorn chicken etc. (although, I have tried those dishes with friends and they are done pretty well)  What I really enjoy are dishes like their Ika Geso - a generous helping of fried squid legs served with a lemon slice, ankimo - monkfish liver steamed and served cold with ponzu and salmon roe (I would love to see an iteration of this dish with truffle, even if it has to be truffle oil for cost reasons), okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and the yakitori is really nice - I like when they do offal.   I have also had the ramen on several occasions, and it's pretty good. It is not the best I have had, but it is the best I have had in Charlotte.  Considering that this place is called Izakaya, I'm slightly disappointed at the lack of focus on the drinks. Izakaya is supposed to have a after-work happy hour feel - everyone goes to drink and food happens - Yama Izakaya feels a lot more like a restaurant. Beer specials and happy hour food specials could go a long way."}
{"text":"Very tasty. Had been missing our ramen place since we moved and it looks like we found our new one. We had the tempora sampler, spicy miso ramen and shoya ramen. Both ramen were delicious."}
{"text":"Serviceable but not outstanding. I got the wrong impression of what type of restaurant this would be but we made do. I had the ramen which seemed to be a bottomless bowl of goods. I don't agree with $1 for corn which is $1 a bag at the store but I wanted it so I had to cough up the chump change. The broth was not very distinct, there was a generous potion of pork and noodles in the bowl along with the included toppings. My significant other ordered the chicken teriyaki; he said there was plenty of meat to go around. A solid teriyaki dish, just nothing to write home about. At the prices they charge, you are given a fair amount of food but it was a bit much for us."}
{"text":"The Japanese izakaya is an emerging trend following the American sushi craze. A traditional izakaya isn't a sushi bar, but has a variety of simple, homestyle Japanese dishes that can be enjoyed as small bites. Think of a Japanese version of a tapas bar and you get the idea.  Yama Izakaya is a good rendition of a neighborhood joint you might find in Tokyo. The menu is varied and features yakitori (charcoal-grilled meats on a skewer), ramen, and all manner of snacky items. I tried the homemade gyoza and it was one of the few times I've seen it properly prepared in the US. These are pork dumplings that should have a soft texture with a lightly pan fried side; that's exactly how they came out on our plates. Tonkotsu ramen was also delicious and included noodles, thinly-sliced tender pork, soft-boiled egg, and slices of kamaboko (fish cakes). The beef negi featured extremely tender beef wrapped around asparagus and covered in a light gravy sauce that was delicious. Tempura was spot on, lightly fried batter that did not overwhelm the vegetables and shrimp inside.  Service was very good and our server kept up with the steady arrival of items from the kitchen. In an izakaya, food is brought out when it is ready, not in courses as we typically expect in other restaurants. In this way, food is always fresh and never sits under a warmer waiting for the rest of the meal to be finished. With its extended evening hours, it would make a great place for a light meal after a movie or other event, or a place to enjoy some refreshments along with some alcoholic beverages. Recommended."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the yakitori. Had spicy cumin lamb, bacon wrapped scallop, bacon wrapped asparagus, and shiitake mushroom. Also had takoyaki and the tonkostu ramen. Ramen was slightly above average where as the yakitori is very impressive. Will come back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I found ourselves in Charlotte one Saturday night and had no idea where to eat. Looked up \"Ramen\" and this place popped up. Sooooo glad we tried it. My husband got excited about the Takoyaki because it's sometimes hard to find in Upstate SC. He thought they were pretty good, but it's not my thing. The chicken negi and duck negi were pretty tasty.   We both got the tonkatsu ramen. *I dream about this ramen.* It was so flavorful and filling. Best ramen I've ever had. I look for reasons to go to Charlotte now so we can get that ramen again!   The place is kind of chic with a lounge area with couches but still has plenty of tables. It's a really nice atmosphere in an almost questionable-looking part of town. But so worth it!   Basically, if you love ramen...go here!!!!"}
{"text":"My first visit here! We came in early before a show so it was not crowded. I like going to restaurants near here because in parking-challenging places like Plaza Midwood, having a no cost big parking lot is a plus.. We started with Nigori sake. Cold and refreshing compared to others I have tasted.  We got a small plate of beef wrapped asparagus and an order of shumai. The beef was tasty- the asparagus still had good crunch and the meat was tender. The shrimp shumai was not the best I've had.. a bit gummy.  Our server ...hmm. Frankly, we were very engaged in our conversation so I didn't chat with her like I usually do so can't remark on her personality, etc. She was efficient and we had everything we needed so that's a plus.  The menu has lots of options, some look somewhat outside the box, so I can't wait to come back and try more items."}
{"text":"I eat at all the ramen places in the east coast and i must say yama is below \"ok\".  Service was ok.  Had the karaage, tonkotsu ramen, shoyu ramen, miso ramen, order of kakuni buns, takoyaki and a sushi roll.  Karaage was basically a deep fried chicken finished with spray of salts.  Kakuni buns are 3 small sliders, tops with Hoisin sauce that is too sweet for the taste.  Was looking for a more appealing taste than hoisin sauce.  Seriously.  Takoyaki doesn't use takoyaki sauce.  It tastes very weird.  Ramen is the top disappointment of all.  No nori and toppings are limited.  The bowls are full of msg, it made me to drink lot of water to overcome.  Taste is bland and the soups are made with mixtures.  Noodles are soggy and bland as well.  Oh yea, the sushi roll definitely not worth $14. Not even of one slice of raw fish.  I know, I shouldn't complain about their sushi or ramen since they are not their specialty.  No condiments available, at least to try to make a better taste myself.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"What an awesome experience! Our server Bryan was awesome and knowledgeable on what to get here. We ended up getting seaweed salad (can't go wrong), chicken fried rice and the pork broth ramen! It was all absolutely delicious! I have seen mixed reviews on the ramen but I thought it was flavorful and came out very hot! I am also deathly allergic to nuts and none of their food is made with or around them. It was such a good feeling to not have worry about whether their is nuts in the food or in the broth.  The environment is very chill and have a lounge feel. We will definitely be back for more ramen and fried rice in the future!"}
{"text":"Officially my favorite restaurant in North Carolina. The interior design was just so cute, the service was outstanding, and everything on the menu was just superb!! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night at 11pm. Our waitress was attentive and food came out fast. I'm a sucker for takoyaki and this place definitely met my standard. I give it a 5 star because there's no other Japanese restaurants that's close to this standard in this part of Charlotte. I'll come here again and try more dishes."}
{"text":"I went here with my husband last night after a rave review from my \"foodie\" parents. It was 8pm and the restaurant was fairly empty for a Saturday night but soon got busy around 9pm. Our waitress Katie was amazing: attentive, informative and not overbearing. I started with the blueberry mojito (YUM) and my husband had the warm house sake. *at this type of restaurant the style is to order a drink while eating small plates first then fill up on a noodle dish.* We ordered the beef gyoza which was the most delish in Charlotte I've had, followed by a shrimp tempura sushi roll topped with tuna, and ending with my fav, pork belly buns. I couldn't possibly order a noodle dish... after I saw one come out, they are HUGE! The overall experience was so relaxed and the food was well spaced so you could enjoy each bite. I cannot wait to go back to actually eat a noodle dish! Way to go Yama!"}
{"text":"Wow. Talk about a happy accident! I read the wrong menu online and ended up with incredible food and service. Fantastic staff helped us with the menu and we got stuffed on small plates. We got a special surprise with their homemade dumplings. What a delicious treat! Beautiful night for al fresco dining in East Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Many Koreans and Japanese not only share the Siberian nomadic genes from the prehistoric migration, we share a lot of similar types of food. Korean Denjang and Japanese Miso, Korean Memil and Japanese Soba, Korean Gimbab and Japanese Nigiri are just a few examples. The cultural similarities including culinary are probably the reason why the two, even after battling for more than 5 centuries, relate to each other overseas. Sure we had horrible wars. Korea won in 1592, Japan annexed Korea diplomatically in 1909. But there are numerous similarities whether the two would like to admit or not. Hey the Japanese royals admitted they're descendants of a Korean prince who emigrated to the island. As much as Japanese love Korean popular culture, Koreans enjoy Japanese Ramen and Udon. And I love Ramen and Udon! Seriously.  I could have that stuff everyday in winter. I mean, it's my substitute for summer Nangmyun. But it has to be done right. You know, Asian food in Charlotte is 1) rare, and 2) nooooot really authentic. Yama Izakaya, however, was legit. I'm talking, this-shiz-can-make-it-in-Asia authentic. The Okinomiyaki was good but better in Fukuoka. But the ramen was just as good as the stuff I had in Osaka. I haven't tried their sushi but I'm sure it's similar with the stuff I had in Tokyo. I went last Friday night and went back the next night! The best part is that the man of the house gave us Galbi and Gimchi for free. He is pretty cool. All in all, I'm really happy there's a proper Asian food place in town besides one at the edge of the CLT universe and another at the outer clusters. After Miyagi's closed down, I was hoping someone would step up. Here it is.  *I realize that this review has become somewhat a history lecture but I'm sure you awesome Yelpers will appreciate learning something new while deciding what to eat, right? Thought so."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! I was a bit surprised though, because it wasn't very crowded on a Friday night. I think we were 1 of 3 tables that night.   I got the miso ramen. I'm not a huge fan of ramen but even I finished the whole bowl. The pork was really tender and the broth was delicious. The only thing is- I think this place is pretty pricey for what you are given.   The service was ok. Our servers (we had 2) were kind of awkward and didn't seem very knowledgeable when talking about the menu. I would come back here again though. I really want to try the smaller dishes."}
{"text":"So far this is one of the better ramen places I have been to in the United States. We had two servers (one was training) and they were both incredibly friendly. The gyoza was okay, but the ramen was pretty decent! Coming from someone who has had ramen in Japan, this does not come close but it comes closer than most! It was enjoyable!  Exceptional service and decent ramen!   That is all I have to say."}
{"text":"It was a Saturday night, no wait, we got sat right away. The atmosphere was cool and chic.  The staff was very friendly and helpful with the menu.  Our server was knowledgeable and gave good suggestions.  The food came out promptly.  Everything was of good quality and delicious. The pan seared pork dumplings were the best I've had in a long time.  The sauce that comes with them was sooooo good. I also tried the octopus for the first time.  It was good (if you like oysters).  It had a spicy wasabi taste to it. The Ramen was wonderful!!! I got the spicy miso broth. Great place to try!"}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy Japanese food and feel the spirit of the Japanese bars. Great atmosphere and service. Sake list is fantatastic. Try the takoyaki."}
{"text":"We went to Izakaya during one of their first days open for cocktail hour and I have to say, I am THRILLED to have a cool Japanese bar in the neighborhood.  I've been to many places in Charlotte that serve Japanese food with a variety of local craft brews, but this is the first place that seems to be aiming for a truly authentic Japanese experience.  They have over ten styles of Japanese beers, Asian-influenced cocktails (Gin and Gingertini, YUM!), and the largest sake list I've seen.  Our server was very helpful in walking us through the sake list, and recommended a delicious, dry sake that tasted miles beyond the sake I've had before.  In addition, the Miso ramen minus the fish cake/egg was delicious, and also vegan.  Wakame salad made an excellent starter.  The restaurant is hip and traditional combined, the staff are happy, and the owners walk through the dining room to personally speak with you.  I can see how Yama Asian Fusion is as successful as it is!    Vegans and vegetarians can find some food options after some tweaking, and that ramen was SO very good.  I will probably find myself here after work quite often, lol."}
{"text":"It was our first time but certainly won't be our last time! Plenty of options for everyone, from traditional Asian fare to creative sushi!   We came on a Saturday night, and there was a good crowd, but not too busy inside. Our server was very friendly and attentive to our table and answered any questions we had. We started with the edamame and the gyoza, which arrived promptly to the table. Both were large enough portions to share, and very tasty. The gyoza seemed homemade and the filling was flavorful and the wrapping was light. I also ordered the tempura appetizer and my husband ordered the miso ramen. The tempura appetizer was more than enough food for me, with two of each type of vegetable and two shrimps. My husband loved his ramen and the way they give you the spices on the side so you can \"doctor\" it up how you like.   Can't wait to try some other menu items on our next visit."}
{"text":"Love dining here, especially trying all the small bites. The Takoyaki is my favorite thing on the menu, and the black shio garlic ramen is a special favorite as well.   They have cool sake carafes as well!"}
{"text":"Service: 5. Environment: 4. Food: 4  Duck skewer: 5 stars  I really liked the meat and flavors on this skewer   Octopus balls: 5 stars Absolutely loved the fish flakes and how the balls are nicely proportion with octopus. The balls had a nice fresh crunch and then softness insides then chewy octopus center in a good way.  Sushi: 3.5 stars So we didn't even know they served rolls until we were about to leave and saw someone else getting a roll that was so appealing to the eyes that we had to get one. We thought it was too plain and missing an ingredient. It only had tempura shrimp in the center and tuna on top, wish it had some more ingredients on the inside to accompany the shrimp.  Tonkatsu Ramen: 3 stars Broth was decent, I liked the flavors. The only reason the ramen was our least favorite is because the pork was basic and thin, lack veggies.  Lamb skewer: 3.5 stars The meat was delicious the texture and flavors aren't my cup of tea  Bryan, our server was great! We were excited to try small plates but very hungry so we asked for a tonkatsu ramen & octopus balls to share as we browse through the menu to decide on another ramen or lots of small plates and skewers. Bryan checked back to make sure we were or weren't ready to order. Water was constantly filled. He even gave us wonderful suggestions of places to see around the area."}
{"text":"The service was great here. The management was very attentive and polite and the food was excellent. I had the miso cod and the tonkatsu ramen. Everything was excellent. I will def be returning to this restaurant more often even if it's out of the way for me."}
{"text":"We dined out here last week for my daughter's 6th birthday. The menu is limited but has some great options. Unfortunately there were not many gluten free options available, but I was still able to scrabble together a lovely meal with Jalapeño Hamachi and the tuna special.   My daughter ended up eating a little bit off of various plates, including my mom's miso ramen, which looked amazing. She was bummed that they did not have Onigiri, but the strawberry mochi to finish off the birthday meal was perfect!"}
{"text":"The food here was okay, you can skip it not missing much . Being from NYC I love trying new places but this won't be a repeat . Better options in the area ."}
{"text":"I've been here a total of 4 times. I'm not sure I'll ever go back.  Visit #1 - They were most recently opened and my BF and I were anxious to try on a weekend evening. We walked in and waited about 5 mins for anyone to even acknowledge our presence. They were fairly busy and seemed short staffed but I could see open table so surely they would seat right away. Once we were greeted we were told it would be about 5 or 10 mins for a table to be ready. As we were starving we left to go elsewhere.  Visit #2 - Came in with a party of 5 and were seated right away on a Friday night around 7pm. Our waiter asked if it was our first time (it was for all of us) and he proceeded to give us a brief but informative rundown of the menu and took our questions and answered them expertly. I had bacon wrapped asparagus and a drink special. Very Yum! Everyone was very pleased with the service and quality of the dishes.   Visit #3 - Me and the BF came back a few weeks later on a weeknight. Our waiter once again asked us if we wanted a rundown of the menu and we declined as we were both in the mood for Ramen (he had gotten it previously and loved it). This was was the best thing I can remember eating as of late. So much flavor I didn't want to stop eating. I was unable to finish but I was also glad I had enough left over to eat again the next day. We were promptly provide with to-go soup containers to transport our delicious broth and noodles home.  Visit #4 - It is bitterly cold out this winter and I promised the BF I'd grab some Ramen and bring it home for dinner so we could enjoy it bundled up on the couch.  I walked in today and was greeted promptly as the restaurant was empty at 5:30pm on a weekday. This is how the conversation went with the Hostess ...  Me: Hi, Yes ... I'd like to place a take-out order please. Yama: Oh, we don't do that. Me: I can't place an order to take with me? Yama: No, our plates are very small and we just don't do that. Me: But I've been here before an taken my left overs home in a container. Yama: Yeah, we can't do that. But you can sit at the bar and have a drink. Me: Um, no thanks ... I'll figure something else out.  HOW/WHY WOULD YOU REFUSE A PAYING CUSTOMER THAT WANTS TO BUY YOUR FOOD AND LEAVE YOU A TIP FOR PREPARING THE ORDER THAT WOULD MOST CERTAINLY COME BACK AGAIN AND AGAIN ... NOT TO MENTION HAS BEEN TELLING EVERYONE SHE KNOWS HOW GOOD THE PLACE IS?!  Needless to say, I'm extremely frustrated and disappointed. Really had my heart set on some Ramen but went to Fuel pizza instead (which was super friendly and very delicious)."}
{"text":"I've lived in Plaza for over three years now and I can't believe its taken me this long to check out this place. I went with a foodie friend of mine and we ordered so many tasty things!  Their sushi is the bomb and it's definitely a step up from other local spots.  The cocktails were good and you should at least try of the signatures. Will  be visiting this place again soon!"}
{"text":"I adore Ramen, and hunt down the best spots worldwide. I cannot begin to tell you how excited I am that there is now quality ramen in Charlotte. The traditional Pork Broth is excellent and the pork itself is some of the best I've had in Ramen. Although they recommend sharing, I say make everybody get their own bowl! Make sure to start with the excellent seaweed salad. You won't be disappointed. This is my new go-to spot when I want soup/noodles!   Also - staff is charming and helpful. I went on election night and as there wasn't a game on, they were friendly and accommodating when I asked to turn the bar tv to MSNBC to watch election results.   All in all, GREAT ADDITION TO THE CHARLOTTE RESTAURANT SCENE."}
{"text":"Exactly as Yelp describes, Yama Izakaya is A-OK.  I had very high hopes coming here, I saw great side dishes and i was extremely excited to try the Ramen in the Charlotte area. Unfortunately, I thought this place was nothing too special.  First and foremost, their menu had a great variety of small dishes, we tried the seaweed salad and the takokayki. They were both fine, but honestly, I thought the prices for the small dishes was incredibly pricey. I believe they were ranged from 7-13, and for small dishes that's supposed to precede before the main dishes, I couldn't really justify ordering more than two even though there was a good amount of things I wanted to try.  Ramen wise, it was fine, nothing spectacular. The shape of their bowl is a little awkward and deep which makes it kind of hard to fish out everything. When i was almost finished, I realized there were a lot of chasu left at the bottom that I almost missed. Noodles were cooked fine, and the broth was well seasoned, but again, I didn't think the flavors were amazing.  Overall, the interior was quite dim, but it's perfect for a date. A good amount of booth sitting, and a few bigger tables in the middle. The decor was quite modern, and I really enjoyed staying there and it was all very comfortable.  Food wise, nothing wowed me enough to go back combined with the pricey menu, I would say if you're just visiting, you wouldn't be missing out on much if you skipped this place."}
{"text":"It's great that Yama Izakaya opened up. Before, I had to travel to Musashi or NYC to get my ramen and JP bar food fix but now I can just come here when I visit the 704!  I had the wasabi tako, takoyaki, okonomiyaki, and tonkotsu ramen. The takoyaki was the best out of all the selections and it was piping hot when it came out. The wasabi tako was good but I would have liked more sliced scallions on top. Okonomiyaki (pancake) was a bit small for the price ($12) but it tasted great. In terms of the ramen, yeah the bowl is somewhat large, but for $14, it was seriously lacking. The broth was tasty and the noodles seemed fresh. Even the amount of chashu was typical (2 slices).  BUT I've been to better ramen bars with more toppings (nori, scallions, naruto, etc) and better made chashu for $10-11. Also, \"shio\" ramen actually refers to \"salt,\" not chicken as mentioned on their menu. Call me a ramen snob, but whatevs.  I also had Orion and Hana Awaka Sake. I recommend the Hana Awaka if you like the sweeter side of things. I wanted the Fukucho but they ran out (on their opening weekend? what tha....).  So bar food - delicious, ramen - left to be desired, drinks - good selection, service - good. A bit more westernized than I would have liked but they do have the hi-tech Japanese toilet that spits out water."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with friends and have consistently had a great and attentive service. We typically go for the appetizer skewers which are both delicious and well priced.   The drinks are just ok although the bartender will and have remade our drinks to our specifications so try their drinks.  We live in NODA and our friends in Plaza Midwood so we frequent here often. Definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"I have passed this place a few times and didn't realize it was part of the other Yama (amazing) restaurant in South Park. It has this sort of cheesy overly large light up sign in a semi-run down shopping center. That said, I love Bistro LaBon which is right next door. Moving on, I ordered a couple of appetizers (grilled whole squid and steak skewers (needed more seasoning)) which were more in the 3 * range. I wasn't up for a big carb load and didn't order the ramen or soba --  -- but this is what you SHOULD order here. Had a bite of the stir fried soba noodles + veggies entrée and it was good. Bottom line - YI has a somewhat limited menu but interesting options. You really should be in the mood for Ramen and why I am rounding up to 4 (and will re-review then).  This place has a few sushi rolls to order (like 4) and several really nice ramen/soba/stir fry dishes. It also has lots of small plates and crafty cocktails (which is more of the theme). I would like to go back to this place and hang out again. I really liked the décor and was pleasantly surprised overall."}
{"text":"I'm no Japanese food connoisseur, but I can tell you the food at Yama was quite nice. Because it's all tapas style, we got to try quite a few dishes. From the shrimp dumplings and popcorn chicken to the cumin lamb skewers, shishito pepper skewers and bowl of ramen, all of the food tasted pretty good. An Izakaya is a pub like joint - and Yama is quite like that, except may be a tad bit more sophisticated than a pub. It's dimly lit, casual, somewhat noisy, the service is good and quick, quite a few food options and some good beer and sake choices (along with a full bar) on the menu. I don't think the food was necessarily authentic or unique by any means, but as pub food - it was good & nothing to complain about. A fair rating would be closer to 3.5 than 3. It's a fun new place worth checking out, especially with a group of friends on a Friday or Saturday evening."}
{"text":"I was really excited when I heard there was a new ramen place in town, but I guess I had too high of expectations for this place.  When I first arrived, I thought that the atmosphere was really great and the decorations were pretty awesome.  I sat at a table where there were ropes hanging from the ceiling to the bottom separating us from the other table.  I thought it was pretty cool.  The lighting in there was dim, so it felt like a great intimate place for a date, or just a small group of friends.  The ramen was what I was excited about, but the their Small Bites were what was amazing to me.  Definitely try the Ika Geso (fried squid tenticles), Takoyaki (fried octopus ball) and Hamachi Jalapenos.  The Tuna Salad is pretty wicked as well!  If you go there, TRY THE SMALL BITES!!!  Now as for their ramen, it's a different story.  I had ordered the Tonkostu Ramen and asked for it to be spicy.  I did not taste any spiciness in it or did I really taste any flavor as it was very bland.  It really made me sad that it was bland.  I have since come back since my first time and I feel that the place is stepping up their game.  It seems that the Tonkatsu Ramen is getting more flavorful.  The service here is really nice.  I quite enjoyed our waiter as he was friendly and very patient to explain things when we weren't sure what it was that we were ordering or wanted more of an explanation."}
{"text":"Yama, the only Charlotte answer to the age old question, \"Where should we get Octopus Balls tonight?\"  Yama is located right beside Bistro La Bon, and if you blink, you might miss it. The interior is dark, but pretty sexy with a bit of a lounge type feel. Our waitress came and seated The Lady and I immediately, and we perused the menu. We did get the Takoyaki, which is a fried dough with octopus (fun fact - Tako is Japanese for Octopus!). They were... they were different haha. But I enjoyed them! Piping hot and comes with bonito flakes which kinda squirm against the heat. It sounds weird, it looks weird, tastes pretty darn good.   For our dinners, we both stuck with Ramen because we had heard great things! I had the Tonkatsu Ramen, and The Lady got the Vegetable Udon Soup. Both were fantastic, and our waitresses recommendations and accommodations to keep things vegetarian for The Lady just made the whole experience better. My broth was, as many others have said, extremely flavorful and full of umami, and the noodles were perfect as well. I think The Lady enjoyed hers a lot, but I didn't have time to ask her before it was gone ;)  Anyways, it's hard to say if we'll be back here often, but it's a fantastic option that I'll highly recommend on my list of ramen places now."}
{"text":"Have been to this place a couple of times. Nice restaurant with decent interior. You can have a variety of Japanese tapas including typical menus like ramen and sushi. Ordered chicken yakitori, takoyaki, assorted vegetable fries, eel roll for tapas and donkotsu ramen. Yakitori was good so I want to try other menus next time but vegetable fries were not as good as I expected. Usually Japanese tempura is very crispy and thin fries but they are just okay. Takoyaki was okay and wish there were more tako(octopus) in it. Ramen was good, the broth was not as rich as I expected but it was good enough. If you want to try small Japanese tapas, this is good place to try."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of ramen but my sister and boyfriend really wanted to try it. I ordered the chicken ramen because The popular pork one never satisfy me no matter where I've tried it. I must say it was the best ramen I've ever had. It wasn't super salty like the regular pork ramen. I tried my boyfriend's pork broth and I'm glad I didn't get it. It was salty like all the other ramen places. We also got the octopus balls and the squid. Octopus balls had good flavor but it was really really soggy. The squid was a little too fishy for me.  The appetizers does not affect my rating though.  The reason why I'm giving it 2 stars is because the service was severally lacking. There were over 4 waitresses and waiters and it was NOT busy at all (3 other tables and two tables outside). Somehow I could never find my waitress and noone else came to check on us all though they were standing on the back of the wall just chit chatting. It took forever to get my waitress to come take our order. The food arrived quickly but after that she was gone again. I needed more water and she was no where to be seen. We finished our food completely and looked for our waitress to ask for the check. After that long wait, we had to wait some more for her to print out the check. I laid down my credit card and she took it and went MIA again. We waited and waited for our receipt to sign. There was noone at the register. She just took my card and left it at the register. I know they know we were getting impatient. Can't miss how my hair whips each time I look for our waitress. It takes longer to get out of here than to order and eat our food. This place has good ramen but only come here if you have more than 2 hours to spare."}
{"text":"Someone pinch me!  I think I'm dreaming. The RAMEN here is out of this world amazing.  We came here by searching on Yelp for Japanese food only to discover they had just opened and we hit the jackpot. Yes, that's right, Grand Opening Night!  They had a complementary photo booth, free food samples and the only thing you had to pay for was your drinks.  I will have to say, I ordered the full size portion of the chicken broth ramen and it was fantastic.  The broth was seasoned to perfection and the noodles were also cooked to perfection (not overly cooked and not crunchy). I will have to say, I tried the Cucumber Saketini and it was not the best drink I've ever had.  It was a bit watered down in flavor and weak on the alcohol.  All of their cocktails are homemade on location, so I would suggest they perfect this drink a bit more before allowing it into the masses.  I digress...  They brought us a few skewers of shiitake mushrooms that were very tiny but full of flavor.  I'd like to see larger sized mushrooms, but they were fantastic nevertheless.  We were also given a few skewered peppers that were flavorful as well. I believe they are going to be really big, really quick!  They just need to get on Open Table to make it easier to make reservations.    The decor is dark and authentic feeling.  The ropes they have hanging between tables along the walls add a nautical feeling and I love it. The waitstaff are very friendly and accommodating.  Abraham was our waiter and he was certainly top notch.  This is definitely a go to place for a nice weekend treat!"}
{"text":"Always glad to check out a new restaurant in my neighborhood.  Yama Izakaya is located in the same strip mall that houses Healthy Home Market and Bistro Le Bon. My friend was seated and waiting on me.  It was fairly busy for a Monday night..  We noticed nice brick work on the walls.  There are thick ropes that serve as dividers between tables that had a nautical feel.  Alternative rock music played in the background.  So pleased that it was not cheesy pop! Because I checked in on Yelp, we were rewarded with free edamame!  We also ordered the tempura shrimp and vegetables as a starter.  The serving was small, and the tempura seemed less crisp than what I have experienced, but it tasted fine. For my entree, I ordered the vegetables and buckwheat noodles.  My friend ordered the same with shrimp.  And, of course I asked for hot sauce.  A small saucer arrived, and because I only had chopsticks, there was difficulty scraping out the remaining sauce.  So, I asked for another saucer of hot sauce.  Yes, I know.  I have a problem. The entree itself was good, but there was nothing that was particularly outstanding about it.  The ladies' bathroom handle had problems.  Someone had to open the door from the other side so that I could escape. This is a newer restaurant, and I think that with time, it will evolve into an established venue."}
{"text":"Previously had the ramen here that did not have the depth and richness of what one may find at a place like Futobuta. However on this visit we explored the unique and traditional Japanese dishes and were impressed with the authenticity. Raw octopus which I have never seen in a restaurant served with some kind of fresh wasabi. Very good. Grilled whole small squid, very much similar to what was found at Mai, the late great Charlotte Japanese restaurant. Vegetable gyoza, fresh made and seared with a vinegar sauce. Monkfish liver, the foie gras of the sea, not often found anywhere, was very good. Grilled duck yaktori, extremely tender. Would definitely recommend for the appetizer. Maybe have a couple here and go next door to Bistro Le Bon for more."}
{"text":"We came here in hopes of some good ramen but we were sad to find it wasn't as good as we had wished. The service was good, our server checked up on us often and the manager came to our table to see what he could do to improve our experience. The ambiance was nice too, it had a modern trendy tapas bar twist to it. Yama Izakaya is also in an interesting location, a small plaza next to a health food store and family dollar. Very easy to miss.   That was all that I could say was good about Yama Izakaya. When we first arrived we were able to use the yelp checkin for a free edamame which was ok, the edmame was fresh and crisp but there was no seasonings to add anywhere in sight. I didn't even see a soy sauce bottle the entire time I was here..  I ordered the shoyu ramen while my bf ordered the chicken ramen. It didn't take long for our dishes to come out. We were pretty bummed about the size since we payed $13 per bowl...was not as big as it should have been. Both bowls of ramen were also terribly bland, seriously it didn't seem like they added any salt or seasonings at all. The ramen noodles themselves were very stale and overcooked, they tasted like instant ramen noodles that were just on the stove too long. It just wasn't appealing to us. I did however, appreciate the amount of vegetables in my ramen.   We weren't impressed enough to come back, hopefully they make some improvements soon."}
{"text":"Awesome ramen and atmosphere. The service was accommodating. I felt like I was paying a little more for the atmosphere than for the food (a little pricey for what you get).   But it's a great place for a hot date!"}
{"text":"The best ramen I've had in the city so far.   The night started out slow because it seemed to take forever for us to be greeted; but once our waitress introduced herself to us she was very knowledgeable about the menu and food. The menu includes tapas style dishes and then ramen and udon.   We ordered edamame and gyoza (pork dumplings) as appetizers which were really good. Then for our meal; I got the shio (chicken broth) with the pork belly which was delicious. My husband got the tonkatsu (pork broth) which I personally thought was just okay but he definitely liked it. We also ordered some cocktails. The \"Who are yuzu\" was absolutely delicious!!!   All in all I would most definitely come back. Especially when I need my ramen fix."}
{"text":"Best authentic Japanese tapas restaurant in town (Musashi offers some other special dishes. But Tapas wise, this one offers the most variety and great quality). Takoyaki (fried octopus) is consistently good. Tonkatsu Ramen is best in Town!"}
{"text":"Pre Valentine's Day date. I ordered the chicken teriyaki. Hubby had the chicken fried rice. He says it was the best fried rice he ever had. I also overly enjoyed my dish. The fresh vegetables were delightful and the chicken was a lot, well worth the order. We didn't finish our plates and left extremely full. Oh- we also ordered the small plate, bacon wrapped scallops and they were so good! We would return for a nice date once again. I do recommend this location for a nice night to dine out and enjoy for an intimate diner scene."}
{"text":"Very good service at Yama Izakaya on Monday12th, Nice selection of sake and beer, food options good variety.  The gyoza were good enough to order a second serving, lamb skewers tasty, and sushi fresh.  Will recommend and return.  ##"}
{"text":"We stopped by this restaurant when we were visiting Charlotte for a CHVRCHES concert.  My partner stumbled on this restaurant while looking for katsu curry (one of our favorite Japanese dishes, but soooo hard to find in NC).  We were really excited, but were sadly disappointed to find that it was no longer on the menu :(  Nevertheless, having tried amazing Izakaya-style food in New York, we were still quite eager to see how this establishment in Charlotte matched up.  It was a pleasant experience overall.  I'll start with the meh:  pork belly buns were alright, nothing to sing home about.  The grilled whole octopus was not very good...it was a little rubbery and dry.  However.... the Japanese pancake was absolutely delicious.  It was chockful of veggies and bacon, and was topped with a generous helping of bonito flakes.  My partner had never tried a Japanese-style pancake before and really enjoyed it.  The star of the day was really the Tonkotsu (pork bone broth) Ramen, though.  The broth was extremely flavorful-- probably the best bone broth I have ever tasted.  Our waitress told us that they boil their broth overnight, which probably explains the hearty flavor.  Noodles were springy and there was a healthy serving of pork slices with the Ramen.  We especially liked that they did away with seaweed so there wasn't an overly fishy/earthy flavor to the broth.  Next time we're in town...we're definitely stopping by for the Ramen!"}
