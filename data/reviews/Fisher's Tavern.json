{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I travel frequently to Cleveland for business and I was looking at a new place to try out.  The mussels were in a white wine tomato sauce.  Great presentation but digging through the sauce it was nothing but salty greasy tomato sauce.  The main course was the 14 oz ribeye.  I ordered the salad and veggies for sides.  The salad was very good but the veggies were clearly steamed frozen veggies.  Now to the steak, medium rare as always, but it has absolutely no taste.  I have never seasoned a steak with salt and pepper after it was grilled.  Looking at the center it was cooked perfectly but it's not blood that's covering the plate. It's worcestershire sauce and you can tell this thing must have been frozen and thawed out in water.  The service was good as there was always a smile when the waitress came over.  When I mentioned about the greasy mussel sauce she looked at it and pretty much agreed.  I'm sure I'm not the first to complain.  Maybe it's a culture thing but steaks should always be full of flavor, especially for a 22 dollar ribeye."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Fishers Tavern last night.  The food was tasty and the service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying Fisher's Tavern on Som Center Road in Mayfield Heights, OH for the first time on Friday September 20, 2013.  Driving pass this quaint little spot I said one day I would like to stop by and try their food and I did.  Those who know Cleveland know that the weather can crazy.....Hot one day....Freezing cold the next and well on my day to try it the weather was beautiful, warm and sunny the best.  I tried the grilled chix sandwich with applewood bacon, lettuce, tomato, pickles, grilled onions (which I sub in place of the mushrooms) the sandwich was a really nice size along with onion rings (great just fried to hard) my date tried the pork chops with bbq sauce they were juicy and a nice size (next time we'll have to tell them well done)....The experience was fantastic I enjoyed it very much....Our waitress Olivia was very professional and kept check us the whole time....I'm looking to going back and taking my mom and perhaps even sitting outside as the cold approaches as they have a huge heater on the deck too! They have other items I would like to try and hope to soon...don't worry they have an inside dining room for those of you who don't want to sit outside on the deck....Stop by and give em a try....I think you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"The mexi-skins were delicious, though fatty. The veggie burger was a bit hard and could have been better."}
{"text":"All three of our meals were very good. Chicken, Salmon and stake. Very satisfied. I would recommend fishers tavern to anyone looking for a nice meal. The staff was friendly and the service was quite satisfactory."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood restaurant, no frills and a little old fashioned, but I love this place!  Service is great and you are always greeted with a friendly smile.    I usually order the grilled salmon with fries.  Awesome! Their  coleslaw is homemade creamy goodness.  They have a terrific selection of desserts as well.  Try the creamy rice pudding or the cheesecake. Its wonderful!"}
{"text":"Met the boyfriend for lunch here today. It's a cute little place, looks like a house renovated into a restaurant. I strongly suggest you come here on a nice day/evening and sit out on the deck. It's a really nice deck that sits along side Som Center Road, however you're just far enough away (and the street is not super busy) so you don't hear any loud traffic noise.   I say this because when you walk inside the restaurant it kind of smells like moth balls aka your grandma's house (well my grandma's house- sorry gramms I love you...RIP!) and the windows haven't been opened in forever.    So like I say...eat outside.  We were quickly seated (outside), service was quick. We started with ice tea, which tasted freshly brewed- definite plus. He ordered a cheeseburger, I ordered the pretzel bacon cheddar burger. We both ordered them medium (personally I prefer medium rare, but always skeptic until I know more about the restaurant and how fresh their meat is); anyways...the burgers were cooked perfectly, just a slight pink in the middle. The bacon was yummy...Applewood Smoked, again cooked just right with a nice crisp, no blubbery fat. The smoky flavor was prominent- good thing in my opinion. The pretzel bun was good, but lacked any special flavor.   The burgers came with a side of fries. Not sure if they were fresh or pre-frozen, but they were pretty darn good.  My biggest complaint about the food was that it was really and I mean really greasy. The bun on my burger was almost a gonner, but I was able to save it by putting it on a side of the plate that didn't have grease. The fries also a little greasier than I would have preferred but honestly that didn't keep me from gobbling them down.  In the end, the service was decent (although I had to search for the server and ask for a refill on the ice tea), however I think the prices a bit on the pricier side for what you get (about $8-10 per greasy burger and fries).  I would go back here again but only after I have given other places in the area a try first."}
{"text":"Fisher's is so good! The service is quick, the menu offers a wide selection, and the drinks are delicious. I came here on a double date and we all shared an order of the potato skins- so good! I ordered the taco salad and my boyfriend chose a fish sandwich which was not on the menu but something they are able to make."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the alfredo here. Never had anything else, and don't plan to.  Staff is always nice, the building itself is cute and quaint. Its very quote unquote vintage, including the average age of a customer. Dessert specials are always delicious.  But aside from the patio, seating is a bit snug."}
{"text":"I grew up down the street. A continued favorite. Get the Fishers fish sandwich with slaw and fries. They also make the coolest fried Mac and Cheese balls for the kids!  A place to hand down to our children!"}
{"text":"Things were fine until the food showed up.  Seriously.   Awesome patio.  Cool old school bar and dining room. Decent beer selection . Marginal wine selections.  The menu is uninspired and poorly prepared. A little more than \"bar food\" but that's all.  That's the frustration. Much potential but they just fall short. They have a great ambiance, and the staff tries hard  and there is essentially no competition in the immediate area but the food?  Swing and a miss strike three.  With the right management/direction this place could be really appealing."}
{"text":"The kind of place that feels like somewhere you'd stop on vacation in the pocono's. Kind of an old tavern feel, lots of heavy wood with a nice deck and somewhat peeling paint. Dark green walls and old crumbly pictures of industry titans. People in the parking lot moving golf clubs from the back seat to the trunk of their beamers.  Food was decent, pretty standard fare - club sandwiches, burgers, steaks and pastas. Other than the sandwiches, the food seems a little steep. The chicken salad was fresh diced chicken, pineapple, cranberries and some other random veggie ingredients that was quite good. Nice pile of fries on the side. The burgers are tender and juicy, but not terribly exciting.  The best part was probably dessert, a lovely homemade hawaiian pineapple cake with a caramelized crust and cream cheese frosting. A bit small for the price but delicious. Service is friendly too, and I might consider another trip back."}
{"text":"My wife an I went here for dinner last night. We hadn't been to Fishers in a long time but we knew the food was always good. Very Friendly staff, New menu looks great. We both had the fish fry. Absolutely delicious ! From the fresh bread, to the outstanding home made coleslaw and tarter sauce. The fish was cooked just right. Neither the fish or the fries were greasy. The prices are very reasonable. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"We came in a group of 18. Originally sat at the bar and waited for tables outside. An hour went by and they were seating people right away on the patio so we said something and they were like \"I don't know\" so then there were 5 empty tables in the main dining room and we asked to sit there and they acted so mad and rude. So we sat and I got my steak salad which I ordered the steak medium and it came out well after waiting 30 mins for it. I asked for another and it took another 20 mins. It was delicious however. The shrimp cocktail is $9 for 6 pieces of shrimp. The entire time the server acted pissed off. Why would they be mad that a huge group is there? They should be smiling and thanking us for our business. The place smells old and looks like they haven't cleaned it in over 10 years. Cobb webs all over bathroom and bar. Won't ever go back."}
{"text":"Huge potential for a 4 star review except the last 2 times visiting had me wondering if a trend has started.  Both food and service was sub par.  However, based on my eating there over 15 times, I'm willing to stick those last 2 under the rug and start over.   Really cool look to the place.  I just love places like this, reminds me of home in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  Just a cozy feel to the place, nice patio, bathrooms are big, and the service is spot on.  Food:  I liked the burgers but have other places to go for them now.  The mussels are good.  The alfredo, as Sam states, is really good.  I always make it a habit to get any specials a restaurant is running for the night (on the weekends only) and its been a fresh catch lately which they cook to perfection with just enough seasoning.  Of course they have a full bar and I prefer to sit in this area when eating.  A little older crowd but I've met some very unique-in-their-own-way people here which made for good convo.  I will be back very soon.  Go there on a dark winter night, its worth it."}
