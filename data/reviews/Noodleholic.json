{"text":"Family Only!
I think the overly positive reviews were written by employees and family - \"food only a mother could love?\"
Fresh - not. 
Flavour - dull. 
Likely one of the worst bowls of pho I've had in the GTA.  Very poor use of money - sorry Noodleholic but you might want to go back to basics."}
{"text":"Sorry guys, closed as of June 10th 2017. All the  furniture was removed next day, a lease issue perhaps . My teenage daughter is crushed her favorite Asian comfort food spot , is no more!
Best of luck to the nice lady who 
ran the restaurant ."}
{"text":"READ EDIT THINGS CHANGED:
Great place. I go regularly for lunch. Friendly people. Its Busy during lunch hours. Could be more spicy but all the specials are good on it's own. The prices are decent.

EDIT: Not good anymore. I had some funny tasting chicken last year and the service is not as friendly anymore."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner a few times.
I had the spicy beef teriaki and the spicy chicken thai.
The prices here are reasonable
There are daily specials from $5 to $6
If you are looking for a good amount of food that is fairly tasty at a good price, this is your place.

{"text":"Noodleholic has good food. It won't blow your mind, but it will fill you up as the portion sizes are quite generous too. On top of that, the daily specials are $5.75. The lady who works there is incredibly sweet and the food comes out incredibly fast. What more could you want for quick eats?"}
{"text":"Ate here yesterday for lunch. I had the spicy beef ramen and my friend had pad thai. Although I would have expected it to be a bit spicier, the soup was delicious. And the food was very reasonably priced. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Don't order the Ramen. It's honestly a salty prepackaged Mr. Noodle type dish: 89 cents at No Frills. The dumplings are great, as is the staff and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food here is ALWAYS wonderful! Fresh, tasty & affordable. Staff are friendly, & helpful. I visit often. :))"}
{"text":"Really good noodles and soup, also really friendly customer service , the Friday special is my favourite"}
{"text":"I love this place and everytime I take someone here they love it too. Service is fast and so friendly. Food is fresh and hot and extremely affordable, the daily specials are my favourite along with some dumplings. Please don't forget to tip this wonderful lady. She works so hard to please everyone."}
{"text":"Personally I think Mandy M's post is pretty stupid. Its unfair to rate a restaurant without having actually tried the food. Remember this is someone's business, be fair to them. If they deserve a poor review so be it.

I live in the area, I only get the daily specials, which are $5.75. In my eyes they taste good and there is good value for the portion size. Overall 4 stars"}
{"text":"This place is cheap but you get a lot for what you pay for. The service is very friendly and they have worthy weekly specials. I've never waited longer than 5 minutes for my order to-go."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY FROM THE PAD THAI! Okay, I wanted to make sure that was immediately noticeable. I wish I had read Aaron M.'s review before ordering, as I wouldn't be in the state that I am in right now... full of regret and bad Pad Thai (to use the term as loosely as a Weight Watchers client's old pair of pants). It really is just noodles and fried veg in a sloppy mess of soy sauce and who knows what. 

I gave two stars simply because the lady who served me was so nice.

I sincerely hope that some of their other dishes are better. I'm going to go back and try the dumplings one day, and if they're a let down, I'm going to have to walk away from this place for good."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. So-call noodleholic should change to *Instant*noodleholic. My ramen was nothing but Korean instant noodle. My hubby's Pai Thai was also different kind of white instant noodle with soy sauce which is no way close to real pai Thai. If I can give 0 star I will. Please use real noodle if u are opening a noodle shop!!"}
{"text":"Save yourself $6 and buy yourself a cup of noodles and some broccoli.... That is truly what the ramen was at Noodleholic. And it wasn't even that they used just the noodles and made their own broth -- there was no mistaking the MSG-laden powder.

We also got the Pad Thai and it was okay if you were expecting a soy-sauce noodle dish but that's obviously not what Pad Thai is suppose to taste like. It's only saving point was that I got the Shrimp Pad Thai and it did actually come with quite a bit of shrimp.

Both my bf and I's tummies started to ache within 45 minutes of eating here too. :(

My advice is that if you're craving Asian noodles in Roncesvalles, go to Pho Ng down the street on Dundas. Do not waste any money at Noodleholic."}
{"text":"Noodleholic is good, inexpensive food.  The veggies are fresh, and there is a large variety of veggies in every dish.  The food is ALWAYS piping hot.  I live about a 10 minute walk from here, and when I get takeout and go home with it, the food is still hot when I arrive home.

The noodles are nice, fresh, and you get a lot of food for a very small price.  For $10, I have enough for two or three meals.  The soups are also very tastey.  The restaurant itself is very clean, tidy and inviting, and the staff are wonderful.

The only downside is there isn't a lot of variation in flavour between the various noodle dishes.  Don't get me wrong, the flavour is great, it just could use a bit more individuality for each dish.  All in all though, its fast and yummy and well worth the visit."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place isn't lined up out the door! The food is fresh, the portions are super generous and the service is very good. So many vegetarian/vegan options, too!  I decided on a kung pao tofu with steamed rice (with too many other choices, it was a difficult decision), and my dinner date had the veggie Ramen with miso broth (which was to die for - probably the tastiest item on their menu). I'm told there's a vegetable broth ramen too, but I'm sold on the miso. Sorry Kung pao, ramen wins this one. Rounded it out with some veggie dumplings and edamamme, and we were stuffed and satisfied. All for a very reasonable price. I will keep going back."}
{"text":"This is a great, inexpensive place to eat. We normally do take-away so I can't comment on the sit down service, but everything has been excellent. I recommend the vegetarian ramen soup. For the price, it is hard to beat. Is the better noodle in Toronto? Sure. But none cheaper!"}
{"text":"The service is remarkable. The lady server has always been very friendly to you and has rich sense of humour. Their foods are cheap and comes with an okay quality. They accepts credit cards and their POS machine supports tap and Apple Pay.

I wouldn't say that their foods are delicate but hey, the price is there, you could hardly find anywhere else which offers the same service and food which is better than here.

Their home style Asian food entr√©es all have veggies and proteins of your choice of chicken, beef and shrimp. You can never go wrong with rice meals, udon and egg noodles but don't expect too much of their pad Thai...;)"}
{"text":"Family owned or so it seems, very little restaurant that serves a variety of noodle and rice dishes.
You won't come here for Micheline starred food but for the menu prices ($8 for a plate of veggie pineapple curry noodle dish and nothing over $10 in general) the quality is great.
The service is very friendly and prompt. 
Would come back again."}
{"text":"Cheap, cheerful, clean. The food tastes fresh and flavourful. It's not a mind blowing culinary experience but if you feel like some solid Asian comfort food at a great price with nice service, you will like it here. I did!"}
{"text":"I love this hidden gem! such good value and flava! :D The spicy peanut beef noodle dish is worth twice the price"}
{"text":"I lived right across the street from here for a while and it was the ultimate place to get fast, good, large portioned food for extremely cheap.  I miss this place bigtime since I don't live on Roncesvalles anymore.  The daily specials are awesome."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai is TERRIBLE. But I've tried most other dishes there and they are good in a comfort food kind of way.

The service is friendly and the prices are reasonable and the portions are good.

Now, if only someone at Queen Mother could teach them how to make Pad Thai.........."}
{"text":"Comfortable food, comfortable dinning and overall comfortable experience. Comfort being the obvious theme because its cozy atmosphere and satisfying food. \"The Best Noodles in Toronto\" definitely will not be a staple theme at Noodleholic but \"The Best Customer Service\" might as well be. Supper inviting and friendly waitress will definitely put a smile on your face. Cheap food, FREE WIFI and overall comfortable experience will satisfy your lunch and dining experience."}
{"text":"Soooo good! I have the Raman beef & slurped the entire bowl. Funny little shop with 6 individuals eating lunch solo. they had music & a TV & everyone looked happy. Great spot for lunch.. super cheap prices & amazing food. I'll be back"}
{"text":"I was so excited to find out there was a new noodle place close by. Went there for dinner, the staff was super friendly, but the store it's self was very empty.  It looked nice and clean though and they have free wifi.

We soon found out why the place was empty though. I got pad thai that didn't seem to have any sort of pad thai sauce nor did it have the type of noodles i was expecting. My boyfriend got ramen.... and well I could have just bought a mr.noodle for 30 cents and a bit of beef and coooked at home and saved money.

They really need to step up the quality of food."}
{"text":"Cheap (less than $7) meals and above average quality. Had the beef ramen here, it was pretty good. They have options to add double noodles or double meat for only a dollar more. They also have daily specials, and I highly recommend the peanut noodles special (I believe it's for Mondays).

Cozy place, free wifi, Service is quick, and they are friendly people. Oh, and they have a really cool debit machine that flashes smily faces at you when your transactions goes through."}
{"text":"I really liked this place on the first visit.  I had the pineapple curry chicken in the restaurant and a hot ginger tea, for less than $10 and it was really yummy.

Then we ordered takeout a few weeks after, had the same dish plus the chicken dumplings.  Dumplings were REALLY good, this time however the pineapple curry chicken was lacking in pineapple, curry and chicken and tasted like soyed noodles and broccoli.

Today we did take out again with the Tuesday special, Chicken Pad Thai and the dumplings and hot ginger tea.  Once again, dumplings and tea were amazing.  However the \"Pad Thai\" is the worst I've ever had, it's not Pad Thai.  It's the same soyed noodles with broccoli, some sprouts and this time an added barnyard aroma to top it off.  Easily the shittiest \"Pad Thai\" I've ever had and practically impossible to get past your nose.

My wife has given up on this place completely, I may give them one more chance if I live through the night."}
{"text":"Amazing!  The food is so good, very reasonably priced and very child friendly. We ordered pan vege fried dumplings(tasted house made), 2 orders of Miso soup, spicy teriyaki beef noodle bowl and spicy thai beef noodle bowl it was only $26.84!! Service was good, food amazing! We will definitely be going back .  The menu is clean and easy to look through, all dishes have vege, chicken, beef and shrimp options. What we both ordered was distinctly different and we loved them equally."}
{"text":"I've been curious about this place for quite some time as I get my nails done right next door. I finally went in a week ago and ordered chicken pad Thai and instead of pad thai I got stir fry rice noodles (thin) with soy sauce , chicken and broccoli that was completely tasteless. I asked the waiter about it and all he could say was that they use soy sauce in their pad thai.  Okay so I thought where is the scallion, tamarind paste, fish sauce, shredded carrot, peanut, bean sprouts....? Clearly not pad thai so why put something on a menu that you obviously don't know how to make? Damned if I know but it was waste of money and time and I will never ever go there again."}
{"text":"Bf and I had the ramen here and it was pretty obviously Mr.Noodles-level ramen broth.  I wasn't expecting authentic ramen, but having surveyed a few different at-home ramen packages, they could have improved the taste even with slightly better store-bought varieties.  The gyoza we shared were pretty stiff and stale.  

Not sure about the other items on the menu, but if you're going to call your restaurant Noodleholic and make a large bowl of ramen your logo, they may wanna up the quality level.  It's quite inexpensive, but you can easily find better for this price point."}
{"text":"Ordered Pineapple Curry with Chicken, their Saturday all day special for $5.75. Tasted great and portion was generous. Service was attentive and efficient. Ambiance is a little lacking as they are clearly overdue for a Reno. Overall a positive experience and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Tasty food at reasonable prices. The place is cute and clean and the food is generously portioned with lots of ingredients. I had the peanut chicken on rice noodles and my partner had the beef ramen. Both really hit the spot and will come back again."}
