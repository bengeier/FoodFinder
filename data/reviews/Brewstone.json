{"text":"Saw this place when driving in Monroeville and stopped in, turned out it was opening week so I hope it gets better.  For a place called Brewstone, I was expecting a place that brewed their own beer.  not only do they not, but  they had one of the worst beer selections I've ever seen at a bar, although their online menu listed dozens of beers as \"coming soon\"   Our waitress was unfamiliar with the beer selection they did have as well. The food was not very good either, I had chipotle chicken sliders and they were bland with no hint of chipotle and the chicken was tough to the point I felt like I needed a kinfe to cut it.    The best thing I have to say about this place is that it was very clean, but it's only been open for a week."}
{"text":"We were very excited to have a new restaurant open in the former John Harvard's space, as it's very close to our house and we go out to eat often. The Brewstone interior is beautiful, with lots of wood, and a gorgeous stone double-sided fireplace. It's without a doubt a warm, welcoming environment (although I could do without so many TVs everywhere).   I really wanted to love Brewstone. We first tried it for dinner on Sept. 19. Service was slow to the point that the manager came out to apologize. Our server was very pleasant and apologetic, and we were forgiving as it's a new place. Some of the food was good (I liked the fish tacos) and other dishes were average.   We tried Brewstone again last night, 9/24. Service was again very slow. I can understand that the kitchen gets backed up, but I don't expect waiting 15 minutes for drinks to arrive. And when my beer arrived... there was a gnat floating in it. I didn't want to wait for our waiter to return, so I walked the beer over to the bar. The bartender replaced it with a \"sorry\" without any sincerity.   We tried the quesadilla and pizza and both were average at best. The fries are not so great either.   So... I'd give Brewstone 5 stars for ambience/decor, and perhaps 1 1/2 stars for food and service. I sure hope that it improves, I really want to like it."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Brewstone.  I miss John Harvards and am really glad they put a similar restaurant in that space.  The server was great and very knowledgeable about the beers.  She recommended a terrific wheat beer that I very much enjoyed.  The portions were huge and you really get what you pay for.  The food is also very good.  I just bought a gift certificate for Brewstone to have an excuse to go back."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Good decor. Great beer selection. $5 craft beer pints, typical on what you would pay for those. Waiter was knowledgable about the beer. Food was ok. We had a salad and pulled pork and it wasn't anything amazing for the price.  TVs at every booth was really cool and plenty more around to view every game"}
{"text":"Nice design and sporty atmosphere surround you in this large detailed restaurant.   Food is decent. Ordered mac and cheese but got more of a penne Alfredo instead. It wasn't bad but not quite what I ordered. Oh...and I'm clear the server was high...  Good for sports and beer I'd imagine."}
{"text":"I like brewstone. I live in Monroeville, and it is one of the few places that isn't a chain. The place is big, and it attracts a wide variety of people. This isn't my first choice of place to go on a Friday or a Saturday night, but it's an alternative if I don't want to drive to shadyside. Their food is good. I like the margarita pizza the best. They have a decent number of brews. I'm not crazy about their live entertainment."}
{"text":"as with everyone else, the decor is very nice and very inviting.   Other than that, well, it ends there.    The beer selection is good, but no one knows anything about beer there and the waitress tried to pretend like she knew.  Waitress was rude, messed up our order, took 25 min (empty restaurant). The burgers we ordered were burnt, we ordered medium, and the soup tasted frozen out of a bag.   After we received our check, the waitress disappeared, not asking us for additional drinks etc.... We chose to walk up to the bar and order additional beers,   the bartender was mute at best.   Upon leaving, we said goodbye to both hostesses, but they were too busy texting and talking to each other and we didnt even get a thank you, have a good night, whatever.     Management NEEDS to take a deep look at how they train people.  One person, we could understand, but the whole staff was uneducated.  Its a shame, cause this place could have soo much potential and we want it to succeed.   thousands of dollars on decor and frozen food does not make a restaurant."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! We ate dinner here for the 1st time a few nights ago(and it happened to be bike night). The place is very clean and the décor is beautifully done with a lot of woodwork and stone...very inviting, comfortable, and pleasing to the eye. The beer selection is why I came, and it did not disappoint! Excellent! A large and varied selection that is sure to please us discriminating beer drinkers out there. As for the food...I sampled the 4 different meals that were ordered for my table and it was all excellent, well prepared, and presented well. I personally had the fish tacos, which were phenomenal! The menu was just right, as well--good selection but not so much as to overwhelming you. The service: well, let me say this: I came for the beer. But I will return because of the service. I was amazed at the level of expertise and service our waitress exhibited, along with her genuine concern for our happiness and enjoyment. She was spot on with everything. THIS is the kind of service I live for! Our server's name was Kerri(sp?), and I give her and Brewstone my highest recommendation.  Well done!"}
{"text":"LOST THEIR LIQUOR LICENSE!  Went for dinner last night and were surprised to see it almost empty. Hostess explained that they had lost their liquor license s couple of weeks ago! We stayed anyway and found the food to be quite good but service was slow. We also noticed that they didn't inform some guests of the liquor issue until they were seated, which I found to be somewhat disingenuous."}
{"text":"Because we had such a terrible experience last time, I posted a complaint on their official site and we were invited back for a \"comped\" dinner.  It was a million times better than our first experience.  Our waitress had some experience and you could tell.  She was knowledgable about the food and alcohol.  The food was fresh and tasty (but I would not say this is a food destination for me), and the regional manager stopped at our table to offer an apology for the last time we were in.   With that being said, I know we will be back to this place because it is a great place to hang out with friends and family, and I appreciated their attempt to win back a customer who was very disappointed."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, good decorations, and a TV on every table let us view an unobstructed Pens game.   The food was average. The fish and chips had an average batter, but the the large pieces of cod were cooked perfectly. The fries were good as well.   The waiters all seemed nice and energetic."}
{"text":"I went here for a happy hour/light dinner and sat in the bar.  The booth was extremely comfortable and i love the TVs at the table.  Others have had issues with both the food and/or the service.  Luckily, everything was good for my group.  Our server was both friendly and efficient - she did explain that the restaurant is undergoing a transition to a new brand, \"Breakaway Grill\" and therefore the menu was a little different and the beer list wasn't up-to-date.  I asked for an IPA and she was able to rattle off a handful that they DID have on draft.  Food came out quickly and the potachos were decent but could have used a bit more cheese.  I also tried the BBQ Chicken Flatbread - and it was good.  I would go back here.  Granted it wasn't extremely busy so I can't speak to how the service would have been if they had been busier."}
{"text":"My husband and I tossed around ideas of where to go for dinner on a Saturday night (3/08/14) with another couple. Our friends suggested \"Breakaway Bar & Grill\" or Brewstone, or whatever name they are going by. Our friends arrived before us and put our name in for the waiting list. The short women with longer black hair took the reservation and had a HORRIBLE attitude. She called our name and we gathered our belongs in hopes that we were going to be seated, she said, \"No. you aren't being seated. Just want to asks you a question.\" Well. Ok?   We finally got seated after a few minutes of confusion because obviously she had no clue what she was doing. We sat at a large high top table and waited 10 minutes before our server finally arrived to take our drink orders. Then another 5-7 before finally taking our food order. The food menu was lackluster, generic & over priced.  I ordered a burger to be cooked \"medium\" with a side of sweet potato fries and my husband ordered a pizza. When our food arrived my burger was cooked well-done, flavorless & the sweet potato fries were room temperature at best. My husband stated that his pizza was sub-par at best and was clearly frozen pizza crust instead of freshly made. Throughout the course of visit random people (I'm assuming who were management but was hard to tell from their very causal jeans and tshirt) came by to take empty plates instead of asking about our food. Our waitress was scarce so we were often left with empty glasses.   Needless to say, we won't be returning due to poor attitudes & over-priced below average food."}
{"text":"This place looks amazing! The beer choices seem really good. The food is really not worth the price.  Our server never mentioned anything special though we said we were new too the place. We asked what was great and she said, \"Well, pizza is really good, but our pizza chef isn't in yet. Everything else is decent.\" (1pm on a Sunday). Not a good sign at all. We should have known by how empty the place was.   So, I ordered a burger, medium, that had goat cheese and bacon (server told me not to get the goat cheese because it can be \"overpowering\"--another bad sign since goat cheese is quite mild, but I asked for it anyways). Burger was overdone and not very juicy, and they left off the bacon and lettuce and tomatoes were smaller than the burger--not what you expect for a $11 burger.  Wife orders an ahi tuna salad vinaigrette on the side. Tuna was definitely cooked in the morning and refrigerated. It was dried out and scaly and they put the dressing on the salad anyways and put a second side of dressing. The dressing was unbelievably strong in vinegar flavor. So strong that my wife asked to take the tuna and have them just provide new greens. One fork dip in the dressing was strong enough. $16 worth of salad that was really something you expect to get at a luxury vending machine.  Beer was good, but she could have mentioned that they had a very limited draft list and that what I was ordering was a bottle. Food wasn't good. Service was, meh. In an empty restaurant, you expect servers to be accessible.  We always go twice in case it was just a fluke, but judging by other reviews, this may be a drinks-only kind of place."}
{"text":"Brewstone has lost their liquor license due to being habitually delinquent in playing alcoholic drink tax to the Allegheny County treasurer's office. They have been permanently closed for months."}
{"text":"The place just opened last week, and I came on Wed night. The interior is enormous with two separate bar areas, a large dining room separated into two spaces by a dividing wall, and an outdoor patio space. The place is full of flat screen hdtv's, and will be a magnet for football fans on weekends in the fall. They have a major high-end sound system throughout the place (which was sadly playing 70's/80's pop music accompanied by videos on some of the tv's). The a/v investment is very impressive.  I have no doubt this place will be popular. The menu is full of reasonably priced classic sports bar fare like wings, nachos, pizza, sandwiches, burgers, pastas, etc. I stayed safe and went with bbq chicken wings for app and a cheeseburger for dinner. Both were good. Pints of craft beer were $3.50 on the night I came, but not sure if that was an opening week special or the normal price.  I have a couple of things to call out: 1) For a place called Brewstone, and with craft beers all the rage, the draft beer selection is weak. I counted 20 different draft beers, most of which are available anywhere you go (Bud Lite, Sam Adams, etc.) I expected a wider selection of craft brews on tap. 2) I would expect a place that has made such an enormous investment in audio / video equipment would likewise invest in sports programming. I'm sure they'll have the NFL Ticket package, but come on guys, throw us a bone and get the MLB package for the summer. On this night, the Pirates had played during the day and so virtually every tv was showing ESPN programming. I can stay home a see that.  Don't come for the culinary experience. This place is about sports on tv, and music when no sports are on."}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch with hubby and the kids (ages 9 and 12).  The interior is nice-- they've obviously put a lot of $$ into the decor and it paid off. Classic bar interior. I liked it. However, I did not care for the televisions at every booth and additional screens on the walls. I have some mild hearing loss and as soon as we walked in, I knew it would be like sitting by myself for lunch. I couldn't hear anything but all the NOISE.   We were seated in a comfortable booth and handed three lunch menus and what I assumed was the complete menu. My kids, not sandwich fans, immediately opened the complete menu and found individual pizzas. They decided on those until the waitress came by and told us we couldn't order from the complete menu at lunchtime... only the lunch menu. Why did we even get one? I will say the waitress was nice and offered to ask about plain cheese pizzas anyway, and she did get those for the kids along with some fries. I appreciate that. The kids said the pizzas were good (they looked good) and one son got the lemonade and seemed to think it was decent.   They brought the kids food out well in advance of the adult's plates. Not sure why. I had iced tea, which was rather weak and warm, and brought out with two huge lemon wedges in it. I usually just fish the lemon out without any problem, but the waitress actually squeezed the lemon into the tea. No thanks. Also had to request sweetener.  I ordered the BLTA-- a bacon, lettuce, tomato and avocado with garlic aioli. I thought about requesting they hold the aioli, but opted to give them the benefit of the doubt. I shouldn't have. It was too much and overpowered the sandwich. I did not enjoy it. The onion rings were nothing special, a little soggy.  My husband got a burger-- the Brewstone. He said it was decent, but nothing you can't get anywhere else that serves burgers.   The food was mediocre, the service lukewarm and the atmosphere way too loud. It was spectacularly horrible, but we won't go back. We can get better American food in lots of other places."}
{"text":"This place is under new management. It is no longer called the Brewstone. The food was so so and there was nothing super spectacular about it. I had a wedge salad which was OK except for the fact that the bleu cheese dressing was not bleu cheese dressing. I had mussels for dinner. They were extremely over-cooked. Everyone else had a burger and they all came out wrong or missing an ingredient.  The beer selection was decent and current.  The wait staff was great which counters for the ignorant hostesses.  The two girls were not welcoming.  They sous there and looked at us and didn't acknowledge us or the other people who came in at the same time.  They stood begins the counter which is in an odd place as you didn't know it was a host stand."}
{"text":"New ownership, new menu.  Best meal we've had there.  Excellent mozzarella sticks.  Fresh tasty Cobb salad.  Tasty burger with bacon.  Nice meal, great service, reasonable prices.  Much improved."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with friends.  The place was not very crowded but the food and service was terrible.  I had a chicken dish that was so salty i simply could not eat it. Our server never returned to fill our drinks or ask us how the meal was.  I can not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food Hounds... every so often while on the road, we come across a place that is so incredible that it raises our standards in coolness and flavor.  Brewstone Beer Company was one of those dynamite experiences that just put smiles on our faces.  An extremely large location with about four main dining areas and multiple bars, Brewstone not only serves up their own blends of house-brewed ale; but offers an array of mind-blowing food!  Right off the bat I was thrilled when they nailed my signature drink, The Brimstone Red - sweet and perfect!  Then they brought out this inconceivable platter of their Brewstone Signature Nachos that was utterly astonishing... never before have I been this floored with the MASSIVE size and flavor behavior of... well - Nachos.  Big enough for a hungry couple or a group, it was off the chain with tri-colored tortilla chips, fresh avocado, jack and cheddar cheese, house chili... should I go on?  We opted for all three meats: grilled chicken, steak and BBQ pulled pork to top our serving.  It came out piled-high with large chunks of chicken that had intense flavor and was moist, juicy and delish.  LOVED the sweet and tangy, smoky BBQ pork that was off the charts - total fan.  As for the steak... sweet and unbelievable!  Best nachos EVER in Food Hound history to date.  The Seared Ahi Tuna again blew my mind... Sashimi grade Ahi Tuna coated with black and white sesame seeds; the presentation was enticing - thick and meaty slices, cool and refreshing, fresh and fantasmic!  I thoroughly enjoyed their wasabi mousse - sweet and spicy with flavor that just makes you want more - WIN!  The Chicken Lettuce Wraps were simple and divine; lettuce, chicken, wontons and carrots with a BOSS ginger soy sauce that enhances the taste of the whole shebang.  Something new that we've never experienced before was the Tri-Colored Cheese Sticks - the BIG difference is the use of cheddar as opposed to the typical mozzarella; but aside from the obvious... they utilize crushed tri-color tortilla chips in the batter used to coat the cheese before frying!  So fantastic and unique - they are paired with a spicy marinara and crispy onion straws for good measure.  Of course we had to try the Mac & Cheese - a hefty helping of over four cheeses co-mingling with penne, then topped with big chunks of luscious chicken to create a hot, steamy mini-meal (make sure every bite has some chicken).  The Corn Chowder had a chunky consistency of potatoes and corn with just a hint of seasoning with a bit of a kick to pop your taste buds.  The entrees cometh... we enjoyed a Tex-Mex Sandwich which was an overwhelming roller coaster of zesty flavor - juicy chicken offers an even keel on this sandwich; the pepper jack and jalapeno gives a spicy kick that is counteracted by the avocado adding a fresh cooling effect. The Shrimp Alfredo's flavor is ka-pow... big, juicy shrimp doused in an intense alfredo sauce - a hefty serving for a hungry critter!  Another big deal at Brewstone is their signature pizza - the Meatball Pizza was a solid and delicious pie; the meatballs were large, chunky and offered a great rendition of an old classic.  I almost passed out after the first bite of the Pulled Pork BBQ Pizza as it was orgasmic!  Sweet, smoky and explosive - stacked with fresh corn, their unreal pulled BBQ pork and delectable caramelized onions... full of cheese with a killer flavor.  Beautiful, bountiful... absurdly GREAT!  Lastly, the Chicken Madeira was like eating a Thanksgiving dinner; but with chicken- creamy mashed potatoes and sautéed green beans that were juicy, fresh and crunchy!  The chicken itself was tender and tucked into the plate with a thick blanket of mozzarella cheese and then drowned in heavenly gravy.  Everything was incredible from the food to the service and the environment itself; this is certainly not a place to be missed.  We'll be sure to pop in next time we're in town - especially for those nachos... Hmm... if I leave now..."}
{"text":"Since I work long hours, many times the criteria for a restaurant is how late it's open.  Sometimes, you get both (open and good).  Brewstone was both!.  We have driven past this place a zillion times and never gave it a second thought.  Last night, we needed a late night place so we stopped in.  First of all, it is GIGANTIC.  There are several dining rooms.   We were seated in one of the bars areas.  Honestly, if you like sports this is your place.  There were about 40 televisions just in this one space (this includes a personal TV at each table.  We ordered some late night snacks.  My fiance ordered their fish and chips special.  He loved it.  It was crisp and very fresh.  Wasn't as enthusiastic about the fries. But all in all, he was happy.  I ordered wings.  I did half Teriyaki and half Buffalo.  Maybe it was the time of day I was eating them, but the Buffalo wings were crazy hot (spicy).  I preferred the teriyaki ones better.  They were all fresh and juicy.    The service was good.  We will probably return.  Maybe for some March Madness?"}
{"text":"Really bad service. Did the same thing that some others did. Tried it last week food was ok and service was bad. Tried again service was really slow, really bad. Bartender has no clue what to do when you place an empty drink closer and closer  to the the edge of the bar. Hopefully some one from there will read this and let him in on a clue you fill the drink after you walk past it at least three times. . The best part is lets you a glass to get ice out of the ice bin.  The bartender pretty much talked to one group of guys on the other side of the bar and ignored the rest of the bar. Have no clue who the bartender was but we were in Sunday night after 11:30pm on the 29th. I'm in the industry and reall didn't feal bad about giving this guy a big zero dollar tip."}
{"text":"Back a second time. Not good let me tell ya.  This time a burger. I expected better, way better. This burger was ordered medium and came out burned and hard and bad as a cinder block. If you know what that is. Why would they send that out to someone to eat. Disgrace in the back. Who is in charge back there. Onion soup was so-so. Blah. Called the manager and told him, they need to do something in the kitchen, because I would really hope they could be better. Why, well the environment here is outstanding, a great venue, and the beer is good enough."}
{"text":"Was a cool place.  The food was alright and they have a decent selection of beer.  The place is huge and has a big outside.  The only drawback with the outside is the only view you have is a sweeping expanse of parking lot.  I ordered coleslaw with my dinner and it looks to be homemade!  There were big pieces of cabage all through instead of shredded cabage like you normally see."}
{"text":"This place is in transition from \"Brewstone Beer Co.\" to the \"Breakway Bar and Grill\" and is under new management.   Restaurant: L shaped setup. Two bars full bars, one indoor and one indoor/outdoor. The indoor bar is in between the main entrance and the dining room. The indoor/outdoor is to the left of the entrance away from the rest of the restaurant. The indoor/outdoor bar has booths with personal TV's, an \"O\" shaped bar with plenty of big screen TV's, and roll up doors which are open on nice nights leading to the outdoor patio. The place is very nice and clean. Very nice look and upkeep  Drink: Great beer selection. They have a long list of beer on tap which includes your normal domestics, seasonal beers, and micro brews. Most places do not have this selection which is amazing for people who enjoy this type of selection. PLUS, they have a two full bars for people who love liquor.   Food: Food has changed since the name has changed and the business is under new management. The menu is similar but not quiet the same and they have rid the menu of many of the items that I liked. They have a good variety consisting of steak, chicken, sea food, burgers, and homemade pizzas. Overall the food is decent but not as good as it used to be.   Atmosphere: Great overall. Dining room and inside bar are a good casual family area. The Indoor/Outdoor bar is separate and has more of a casual bar feel to it. Great place for any occasion and for sports games.   Staff: Overall they are not bad but they are certainly not great either. Some of the waiters/waitresses are good and some not so much. All of them are friendly however some seem very new while others are veterans in the food service. The service is very inconsistent. More consistency would go a long way.   Overall: Good but not great. I miss the Indoor/Outdoor bar being open more often. It really gave the place a different dimension and a more causal relaxing feel that nowhere else really offers during nice days. I also miss the homemade dressings, specialty pizzas, BBQ sauce, and custom burgers. Sure they offer these things but they are not the same as before. I like the place and will go there occasionally but not as much as before. Would have 4-5 stars if they would go back to some of the things that originally made this place the way it was."}
{"text":"I had heard some bad reviews about Brewstone, especially about the service there. So I was not expecting a great time when I walked in on Wednesday night but I was pleasantly suprised. First off, I have to get this off of my chest...I was a huge fan of John Harvard's. I was a member of their Mug Club from the moment they started it, and I miss it horribly. So naturally I was very disappointed that the brewing equipment is gone. Don't let the name fool you, Brewstone Beerhouse is not a brew pub. However they do have a fairly good list of craft beer available, as well as the regular cra*.  The service was very good. Our waiter, Lindley (?) was very nice and attentive, extremely helpful as was the bartender in the back bar. The food was good, I had a burger (cooked perfectly, very tasty) It was a little loud, there was a live musician playing by the patio area, but in the back by the restrooms the place was much quieter. The personal TV's in the booths will make for good Football and Hockey seasons. I enjoyed my visit and Brewstone is definitely somewhere I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here on a Wednesday night (2/5/14), and at first, we were very upset and told each other that we would never come back again.  We asked to speak to a Manager, and the manager Carrie was extremely friendly, customer service oriented, and helped make our visit a much better experience.  We will be back thanks to Carrie fixing the issues with our meal.  Long story short, we waited 35 minutes for our appetizer which was just cheese sticks, and then waited over an hour and 15 minutes for our dinner.  My wife ordered a burger which ended up coming out like a brick it was so overcooked.  I ordered the boneless wings with mild sauce and the wings were overcooked, and cold when I got them.  It looked like they were actually put in the microwave by the way the sauce was by the time I got them.  After waiting an hour and 15 minutes, we were not happy at all.   The manager (Carrie) came over and apologized to us for the quality of the food, and for the wait time, and assured us she would take care of it.    Within 10 minutes, we had a replacement of our wings and burger, and this time they were cooked perfectly.  Carrie also compensated us the check for the wait time and the food being messed up the first time around.  Turns out that there were 2 parties of over 30 people booked at the same exact time and the kitchen ran behind."}
{"text":"I got the feeling that Brewstone isn't exactly sure what it wants its identity to be.  There are a large number of beers, but as far as I know, none are brewed by Brewstone.  There is a large bar and huge seating area that seemed like sports bar meets high class lounge.  Booths each had their own individual TVs (along with several TVs on the walls) but there are also fireplaces and other items that didn't seem to go with the individual TVs.  The menu is equally as mixed.  There are traditional bar favorites, but then there were some \"fancy\" things as well.  The nacho appetizer is HUGE.  The two of us could have eaten it and not had an entree and still been full.  It was tasty, but they should consider cutting the portion and the price.  Or at least having a half order option.  The corn chowder is amazing.  I loved the taste and texture and was disappointed when it was gone.  The burger, sliders and pasta were all OK, but nothing remarkable.  We'll probably be back to try other dishes and possibly happy hour specials (half priced martinis), but we won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"I would give this a 3 1/2.  Typical bar food selection but the food is not so bad.  I just don't love that the menu is literally one page. The atmosphere is great though. A tv at each booth!???!! Awesome for avid sports fans. They have a huge selection of beers, wines and hard liquor so this is a great place to hang out. I prefer happy hour with three dollar drafts and six dollar margaritas :) service is a bit slow here and it was a bit hard to get our drinks refilled but the atmosphere can't be beat. This is a good place to hang out and eat, just not the biggest of menus. Also, there are coupons a lot of time in the clipper magazine!!! Check it out."}
{"text":"Decent draft selection and local brews including full pint church brew works all saints rivertowne and east end.  Excellent staff and really good burgers.  Fun sports bar atmosphere with a touch of class.  Too bad it is under new ownership.  Hopefully the new owners don't change much.  We have been here many times and always leave happy."}
{"text":"Brewstone is BEAUTIFUL.  Twinkly patio lights, huge, Sonoma-esque vibe inside...seriously, just gorgeous.  Unfortunately, that's the only thing it has going for it.  We arrived and promptly checked out the huge specials board on entry.  It was Wednesday, so patio pint night.  $3.50 craft drafts?! Sign me up.  We were seated, next to a screaming baby might I add, inside, even though we requested the patio.  We asked our server to be moved to the patio.  We moved to the patio, where our new server tells us the special: half off lettuce wraps, which was advertised on the board as the next day's special.  For Ladies' Night.  Whatever.  We order beers anyway and hope for the best.  We order nachos that have no meat ingredients listed in the menu (unless you opt in), and they come smothered in beef chili.  NOT cool for vegetarians.  Especially when most of the entrees here are approaching the $20 range, I don't want to be surprised with \"secret ingredients.\"  While eating, we overhear two parties next to us request to speak to the manager.  Not a good sign.    Bill takes 45 minutes to arrive after requested.  Beers aren't on special.  We pay full price and high-tail it out of there.  Not going back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is warm and modern. The bathrooms are beautiful. The nachos are heaping. The draft beer selection is vast. The service is terrible. I went here on a bike night. Usually bike nights are informal sit where you want but this place was different. The hostess had to go and see if there were tables available. This took her a few minutes and she informed us she would have to move a table. Which she did not need to do. She did not know the specials. Then the waitress came over and told us we took some one else's table. No one sat at the table the whole time we were there. We moved closer to the fire. Then the waitress took our order, not when she originally talked to us but a few minutes later. She barely knew the specials. We ordered our drinks. The waitress brought them in a reasonable time only to spill one in front of me and the other on my leg. No big deal, but it did happen. I asked about the food specials posted, and she said they did not have any. I asked a manager as well. The cards on the table said food specials. He said there were none. Then the waitress brought the check. Our beers were full price. She told me it was the beer tax. They were $4 per beer and had two different prices after this beer tax. She fixed it after this was pointed out to her. On the way out the manager did not even ask about the evening. He did not get my opinion and will not be getting my money again. I gave it 2 stars versus 1 because I did not try the food. If the food is bad then this place is a 1 star. The service is poor. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible! Just got up and left...seated for 15 minutes and no one came to even take a drink order!"}
{"text":"Bartender overwhelmed with no one in the place.  He seemed like he was up for a few days on amphetamines.  I walked in at 9PM, Could get no service till 9:08. Immediately informed kitchen closes at 10PM???  What is up with Manureville... no places open late...and this is directly across from motel with everyone on business trips Duh!  The stupid shall be punished, looks like this place will be closing... I wonder if owners know bartender is inept and chasing people away at 9:00...probably not."}
{"text":"brewstone has one problem that holds them back. Their service is absolutely terrible. their food is delicious, great beer selection. but when it takes 45 minutes to get appetizers or 15 minutes for a draft beer its unacceptable. I have went here three times at different times of the week and have expierenced the same problem."}
{"text":"This is a tough place to review...  The decor... 4.5 stars.  Lots of seating options indoors and out.  Tons of TV's available for game day viewing.  The menu... 3 stars.  It's got the usual sports bar fare, but because the place looks so nice, I expected a more extensive menu that just a one page, black and white printed list of their offering.  Perhaps we got a game-time/lunch menu??  The food... 4 stars.  Among the 6 of us, we ordered 2 kids of wings (Garlic Parm & the Whiskey Bourbon), but for $10 you'd think you get more than 8 wings per serving.  Both flavors tasted pretty good; though I would have liked a little more garlic or salt on the garlic parm flavor.  We also got the nachos - pretty standard, and a variety of burgers.  Everyone enjoyed the burgers.  Very flavorful and moist.  The drinks from the bar were pretty sweet.  The service... 1 star.  Sure, it was game-time, opening weekend of the NFL season, but the place wasn't packed.  Most of the patrons were seated in either of the two bar areas.  I only saw one table in the large dining room.  So, either the placed wasn't properly staffed by management for a game-time crowd, or the service was incredible slow.  Our server was very nice and courteous even when I'm sure she could tell we were getting annoyed with repeating requests for refills on drinks long empty, or asking about the status of our food, but she kept a smile and responded politely.    The pricepoint ... 3 stars.  The prices were about what you'd expect for bar food.  $10 for a burger, etc.  In all, while the food was pretty good and the set-up/layout of the place is nice, I think the only way I'd return is if I was truly there just to watch the game, and the drinks/snacks were an afterthought.  If I was going to hangout with friends and watch the game and wasn't going because I was hungry, then it might have been okay."}
{"text":"The Brewstone was perfect for a casual dinner and drinks. We went on a Saturday night and there was no wait, our booth was comfy and had a tv along the wall. We ordered a couple of appetizers and a flight of three different beers. They had a large selection of beer to choose from and the food menu was great. The prices were good and the food we got was very good."}
{"text":"Perhaps most the opening week jitters have been corrected.  We stopped in last night for dinner and were very impressed.  As mentioned in another review, the place is spotless. They invested some serious cash in converting the decor from what used to be a dimly lit John Harvards location.   Two bars seems odd however but both were relatively busy.   I went with the fish and chips as it's my baseline for what any bar/pub should get right without worry. It was a bit light on fish and heavy on fries but both were good, so I can't really complain for the price. Better half had the BBQ pork sliders (carolina style) and thoroughly enjoyed them.  Mixed drink for her and draft micro for me seemed reasonably priced.  Draft beer list was certainly bigger than I expected from earlier reviews.   Having a TV inside every booth seemed excessive, but should go over extremely well with the sports crowd and should do wonders for BW3's prices and awful service across the street.  At least none of them had volume on.  Wait staff seemed very attentive but this may also be because they just opened and over-compensate.   A roof over the patio seems necessary, we'll never sit outside on a sunny day without it and nobody was out there either on our visit.  We'll definitely be returning again to try the rest of the menu and catch the drink specials during a steeler game.  Glad to see something different than just another chain restaurant move in the empty spot in Penn Center."}
