{"text":"Stopped here on a sunday morning with the family.  Nice small traditional diner.  All the food was very good, nothing fancy just basic omelettes and pancakes.  The service was great.  Im sure to be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, super nice people. Just what you want in a diner. Get a breakfast bowl or a breakfast sandwich. Both are great."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast platter  - great comfort food breakfast meal.  Coffee hot and strong.  Classic western PA town environment on a side street.  It was game day so lots of locals in their Steelers garb coming in added to the whole thing.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone, and will come back myself."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp. Glad we did. Great little diner for breakfast and lunch. I did the breakfast sandwich which was much larger than I was anticipating and my girlfriend got a salad which she really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Pancakes the size of the plate! Absolutely delicious diner fare. Highly recommend stopping in."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood find with good, simple food and friendly service. It's small but breakfast and lunch do not take long so the tables turn quickly. The coffee was very good and my wife and I are picky about our coffee. We both had French toast and bacon and it was delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Chev and Rachel's is a destination worthy of your stop.  Personable, friendly, delicious and fast service with generous portions make for a fully satisfying experience.  Here you will see the entire family pitching in to make this \"the\" place for a memorable breakfast.  Definitely 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Very friendly family feel. A couple of neighborhood dogs walked by with their owners and the owner walked outside with bacon to give them. Loved the place and will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to give this new neighborhood diner a try.

Standard fare, small menu, but very well done. Hubby had an omelet of american cheese, bacon and green peppers with a side of home fries and toast. He deemed his breakfast \"delicious\".

I had scrambled, bacon, toast and homes fries. Bacon was the perfect amount of crispy, the toast was nicely done. I appreciated the home fries, not a drop of grease to be had! The scrambled eggs however were brown and a little bit dry.

We both had sodas to drink and they are a very large size. The waitress (owner?) kept us refilled. She kept incredibly busy with prepping and such. Her husband (I believe?) was doing the cooking. Both friendly, talkative people. Prices are right on the mark too.

It's nice to have something new and local and different to us. But be warned, they close at 1:30!"}
{"text":"Chev & Rachel's offers the BEST breakfast in Pittsburgh.  My husband and I make it a point to eat here every time we are in the area.  A small but mighty establishment, this adorable neighborhood restaurant offers creative and delicious \"down home\" breakfast combinations for an excellent price.  The  experience is like coming home- the atmosphere welcoming and relaxing. This place is a MUST for those of you who enjoy a hearty breakfast."}
{"text":"Great local family owned diner situated in the heart of Emsworth. Atmosphere is welcoming and the food is more than reasonably priced. It's always great to see Chev himself behind the counter. Would personally recommend a breakfast bowel or burger when hungry."}
{"text":"Owner operated local family restaurant that serves amazing food. I've always felt welcomed and at home when eating here. Eat here, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"So, we are from the other side of town- looking for a place to eat while doing business in the area. First it's one of those places where you can't tell who the owner is because everyone is so kind and customer focused. - it's small and quaint. 22 chairs as my 7 year old counted.  My husband and I had eggs over medium, meat potatoes and Mancini toast for $6.00. the kids had pancakes.  The pancakes were dense and hearty- so if you are hungry 2 will fill you up for $4.00.  
So I'm a stickler for my carbs. I love the mancinis toast. If a diner doesn't have it, I don't go.  And the POTATOES guys.  They were cooked all the way through. And dark and crunchy on the outside.  No ketchup needed.  
It's cash only- but for some reason most great diners are. 
Mismatched mugs, great coffee, warm smiles.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Quaint family diner with delicious food! The only thing better than the food is the service!!! Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"When I read in the Post-Gazette that Chev and Rachel's was opening not 5 minutes from where I work overnights, I could not be more excited.  All I needed to do was convince my co-workers to give it a try...which really wasn't difficult.

At 7am on a winter morning the store front that is Chev and Rachel's is like a bacon calling me home.  Uh, I mean beacon.  The owner, there by himself for the first hour or so, was happy to greet us.  Upon sitting down there were a couple little things I noticed that impressed me.  First, under my utencils was not one, not two, but instead a generous pile of napkins.  Things can get messy when it comes to me and food and I like when a restaurant lets me be liberal with my napkin usage.  The second thing I noticed, which has nothing to do with the food, was a bag of pet friendly ice melt inside the door.  As a pet owner, it's nice to see a business owner who cares like that.  Especially when I saw several dogs walk by the door.

The menu isn't all that adventurous but what they do offer is well executed.  The chocolate chip pancakes are massive.  My Breakfast Bowl was a delicious mixture of potatoes, eggs, onions, cheese and bacon with some Mancini's toast added.  The prices were reasonable (my breakfast bowl plus side of toast was under $10 with tip) but be advised they are cash only and the dining room is very small.  Still, if you can squeeze your way in, give it a try.

My one star deduction is only because, as David B pointed out, they need to turn on the grill hood.  I don't mind smelling like the diner itself, but not when the diner smells like it might be on fire.  Perhaps during warmer weather when the doors can be left open that will help.  Until then, I'll give it another go."}
{"text":"We so wanted to love this new breakfast place in Emsworth.  Be advised that it is very tiny and just opened.  On he positive side, the prices are very reasonable.  On the negative, they need to turn the grill hood on.  Pancakes were excellent, eggs, not so much.  Check back in a few months to see if they get the kinks worked out."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast. Chev served us and was really friendly. Locals who are repeat customers came in and he knew what they wanted. Located in a residential area with lots of character. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Basic small town mom and pop that has a great vibe and quality food.  Only been for breakfast but after 3-4 visits have never been disappointed. Always a solid group of regulars at counter and tables are hard to come by but if you have to wait a few minutes no big deal.  Very friendly staff.  Would recommend to anyone who's even thinking about going to Eat N Park.  Step out and try a real homemade breakfast !!!"}
{"text":"Note: Place only accepts cash!!

I knew exactly what to expect with this Emsworth brunch place (as Emsworth and Bellvue are not necessarily 'brunch' type of places) and it lived up to my expectations.

The place is settled in a neighborhood and has street parking out front. A counter and a few small tables make it the type of place where you feel like the entire restaurant could start having a conversation at any moment. During brunch, an older gentleman wondered into the store with fresh herb plants to give (sell?) to the owner. Fit in perfectly with the friendly feel.

Staff was welcomeing and seemed like they'd been waitressing for decades. I opted for the breakfast bowl which was similar to the type of food I'd be able to make myself if I had the ingredients. The potatoes, cheese and bacon made for a hearty meal. Nothing especially crazy if you're looking for unique brunch food, but it's a great place to enjoy breakfast."}
{"text":"Love this place.  This is your quintessential family diner. They run fairly unique daily specials, think Bob's Burgers unique, like pierogi omelets.  They also make breakfast bowls and decent home fries.  Their eggs are good and the service is fast.  If you are looking for a trendy or hipster place this is not it but if you are looking for an honest diner breakfast at a good price, you are in luck."}
{"text":"We headed here based on Yelp reviews after The Great Race to get away from downtown and snag some brunch. 

Tucked back in a residential neighborhood, this place is TINY! A counter and half a dozen tables is all there is to it.

The menu is simple breakfast fair...eggs, omlettes, pancakes and hash brown scrambles. Prices are fair to cheap.

My husband ordered the breakfast bowl with  ham and rye toast and deemed it \"just ok.\" I had the basic breakfast bowl and bacon chocolate chip pancakes.

Let me tell you about those pancakes.

Wow.

If I'd only ordered those, I might have given this place five stars. Unfortunately the breakfast bowls were 3-4 star worthy...so I'm going with 4 overall.

If you want a treat though, go in for those delicious bacon chocolate chip pancakes, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great local feel.

Several \"regulars\" were coming in while we were there which gives off a good vibe. They use Mancini's Bread which is always a breakfast favorite. All the breakfast classics are on the menu for reasonable prices.

I had the hot sausage and cheese scramble which was lovely! My husband had a veggie omelette and was not disappointed.

Very small dining area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I been here 3 times and it was delicious each time. Service is fast and very friendly. Will definitely keep coming for weekend breakfasts!"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place because our regular breakfast place was closed,  and boy I'm I glad we did! Excellent food, reasonably priced and very friendly fast service.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great morning breakfast in Emsworth with my best friend! We had eggs delicious hash browns bacon and toast. The coffee was delicious. It is so nice to have a breakfast spot in my little home town."}
{"text":"Wife and I were in Pittsburgh looking for a house and we needed a great breakfast spot.
We sore Chev & Rachels Family Diner on Yep and decided to give it a shot.
From the outside it looks a bit run down.
The inside is on the small side has maybe enough room for 20 people.
Dont let that detract you as the service is totally amazing.
I had 2 eggs over easy with bacon and home fries and the food was super great and cooked perfectly.
Chev & rachels is definitely the place to go and I recommend it 100%.
You can be sure I will be going there a lot in the future.
Only draw back if you want to consider it a drawback is they only take cash.
No big deal to me but remember to bring cash or you won't be able to get the best breakfast ever."}
{"text":"Sweet neighborhood diner. Good food, nice staff.

I really enjoyed the French toast made with croissants and blueberry."}
{"text":"Well, you can't beat the price. Breakfast for my wife and I (ham-and-cheddar omelet, toast, coffee; three eggs, toast, coffee) was only $10. Also worth noting that our coffee was free with the Yelp check-in offer.

My wife's eggs were fine as were both our orders of Mancini's toast. And the gentleman who waited on us was friendly and fast. But my omelet was not very good at all.  You can see the from the picture that it didn't even look that great, almost like it was covered in pancake batter. 

It was disappointing because we like supporting small, local, family-run diners like Chev and Rachel's. Maybe we just caught them on a bad day."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  We had strawberry French toast..  fresh strawberry!  Just the right amount of sweet.  Also had a Reuben but the best part were the home fries. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great little secret in Emsworth. If you happen to be in town in the morning or early afternoon you must stop by this place. Great breakfast menu at a great price."}
{"text":"A very cute mom and pop run diner in Emsworth.  This is a very small place, on an interesting road that seemed more residential than commercial.  The service was fast and friendly, portions were large, and food was very hearty.  I got the pulled pork omelet with home fries, she got the french toast.  All was good, tasty diner food.  Of particular note were the home fries - crunchy on the outside, firm (but well cooked) and not mushy on the inside, and well seasoned.  They were excellent."}
