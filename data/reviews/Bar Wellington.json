{"text":"Pros: Food was excellent! Cons: Service. Took almost 45 minutes for the food to come out and the waiter came to our table twice. Once for us to order. Another with the check. A waitress brought the food and then never came back. We had to flag someone down after 20 minutes to get  another beer and the check. No offer of dessert. Just poor service overall."}
{"text":"This used to be my local, at which point in time I thought it was so-so. I went back there recently, however, and I have to say the food was amazing! My current local is The Bedford, which is pat of the same chain and therefore has the same menu, but the same dishes at Bar Wellington were simply phenomenal, with good portion sizes and great pricing. I had the club sandwich, while my friends had a pasta dish and burgers. We all tried each others and all were amazed by how good each dish was. Our server was efficient and friendly too, so no complaints there, and we got seated much sooner than we had anticipated despite the busy patio."}
{"text":"I've only been to bar Wellington for brunch and beverages but I really do love this spot. I suppose for entirely different reasons.   First, brunch: the eggs benedicts are fantastic, all of them, and it's due entirely to the quality of their hollandaise sauce- light and silky without sacrificing flavour. Moreover, the coffee has cinnamon in it; ~cinnamon~! There are some pretty great brunch spots in the city but this is one of my favourite ones.   Next, beverages. With one of the few west-facing patios in the area (never mind the fact that it overlooks a great park), you can imagine how busy it can get here in the summer. There's a secondary patio upstairs but the ground level one- beneath the trees, next to the sidewalk- is definitely where you want to be. Anywho, they've got a great selection of beer and they're one of the few establishments in the are that sign on for the free King Street Pub Crawl each year. All that equals a giant cup of awesomeness in my book."}
{"text":"Pub food with some flare. It's a nice place if you're looking for somewhere casual but not the typical pub food. The mussels are fantastic! Also highly recommend the mac and cheese"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time about 2 weeks ago. The atmosphere was nice, the waitress was super friendly and attentive, and the menu had a wide variety of options. I started with a latte ( the other 2 people I was with got coffees), and it was pretty good. I liked that it came with a mini biscotti. I wasn't too hungry so I ordered the Field Greens Salad. I found this salad to die for. I know..a salad? Yes, I wished there was free refills ;) and  I was thinking about it all afternoon, and even later into the week. The candied pecans were my favorite. About a week later, I had 2 girl friends come for a visit, and since I had been raving about this salad, we went here for lunch and all ordered it (the both of them had chicken added). When mine came, it seemed A LOT larger than last time (and both times I ordered small), but I certainly wasn't going to complain about that. However, I soon realized it was missing the candied pecans. Talk about bummer. Both of my friends, though, were missing pretty much all the components besides the lettuce and chicken. No cranberries, pecans, grape tomatoes or cucumber. Not sure what happened there. They decided not to say anything to the waiter. They still liked the taste of the salad, it's just too bad I had built it up so much, and for whatever reason, it wasn't made the same.   That said, it won't stop me from coming back. That salad is just too good. Though one time, I should probably venture out and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Worst customer service!! We ordered some drinks and asked for water, the drinks came but the water didn't come for 30 minutes so we asked again. The waiter then brought over one cup of water even though there were 7 of us at the table. We asked again-water for everyone and another cup of water came, it wasn't until the 3rd try when the waiter brought a pitcher and cups for us. One of us got food and it took close to an hour to come out."}
{"text":"Bar Wellington is a lunch favorite of mine.  Great patio, friendly staff and delicious eats make this venue a staple in my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"This is your quintessential neighbourhood bar!   The service is pleasant, the beer selection is great and both the street-level and 2nd floor patios are lovely.  The apple tree adds great ambiance. It's great for private parties, too.   I've been here several times, and during all seasons... on a summer evening with friends, on a rainy day with my spouse, at night to enjoy a few pints. The food is reliably decent bar food at a reasonable price. The crowd is always nice and never obnoxious or too loud.   Foodise, I especially enjoy the salads and am always a fan of sweet potato fries. Also, there is enough selection in the menu for when you're in a group, or if you're a regular.  For what it is - a Bar, on Wellington - it's perfect. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I live nearby and usually go here every other time I go out to eat. Service is occasionally spotty and it can take a while to get your drinks but the food is always heavenly. Staff is very friendly, they just seem... inattentive sometimes.  The chicken and brie sandwich has recently changed names but it is still sinfully good. Sundays feature melt in your mouth prime rib, literally, and the option to bring your own wine with a rather low corking fee. Those that actually drink wine tell me that fee is very low but I would not know myself.  Hope management improves staff levels or training, whichever is needed to improve service speed as it is literally my only complaint about this place."}
{"text":"To me, this is a 3 star and I would really have a hard time ranking a pub more then this.   Bar Wellington lives up to your expectations towards a pub: casual ambience, good beer, food is good for pub standards, staff is friendly, sports on TV...so I think this is a safe bet for anyone looking to go to a pub!  To try: Prime Rib Poutine!"}
{"text":"I just love this place!  This is a local fav for me and I go here at least once every week or two :) The service is always great. The food is delicious and I love the atmosphere.  It has an awesome patio in the summer and such a nice, intimate vibe on the inside for the colder seasons.   I just keep coming back :)"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner on Friday. I've been here before and thought the food was bad but had hoped it had improved over the past two years: it hasn't.   The food is really bad, I mean if you can't get Nachos right there is a serious problem!   The service wasn't very friendly as we had experienced before and the prices are higher than other local pubs who offer better food and services.   All in all, I would only recommend grabbing a quick drink here at most."}
{"text":"Arrived Saturday at 6. Received menus 5 minutes later after having to wave someone over. Gave our drink & food order to someone other than our waiter bc he was busy hanging up their brunch banner instead of serving his customers. Food was nothing special.    C level review (and tip) for C level service."}
{"text":"I wish I could give two separate reviews for this place, as their drinks are good, patio is nice and the interior is great.  My real beef is that the food is really bad, and the service can be almost as bad as the food.  The first time we ate there, my meal was ok, but my partner's medium-rare steak was so over cooked it was grey. We almost never send anything back, having been in the service industry in a past life, but this was the most over cooked piece of meat I've ever seen come out of a professional kitchen.  We went there for brunch a couple of weeks ago, and I ordered eggs Benedict, but the server informed me there was no back bacon, I asked for ham instead, but they had none. Now it was only 10:45 am, they had the entire brunch service left and had already run out of back bacon. Not a good sign. But we sucked it up, and I said ok to eggs Benedict with actual bacon.  When our food arrived, my partner had ordered the French omelette, and it was also so over cooked... I thought we should have sent it back, but the boyfriend diligently ate about a third of it, before finding the interior was plain burnt. My eggs Benedict had a little tiny bit of tasteless hollandaise on them, and were dry as anything. This wasn't helped by the eggs having had the hell cooked out of them, no yolk spilled out, they were solid.  At the end of our meal, I had an empty Caesar glass, that my waitress took as she walked by without asking if we wanted the bill or another drink... She was just going to leave me sitting at the table with no drink!   It was time to go.  If you go to bar Wellington, go for the drinks only. Skip the food. I think we will head up the street a bit farther next time we go out, and will definitely not be eating there again."}
{"text":"Great service, knowledgeable servers, and damn good pub food with a bit of a twist. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!   This bar has grown on me. They did a lot of renovations in the past year, and there is now more room at the back to sit and have food or drinks. There's nothing extraordinary about the place, but it's clean with a dark wood interior. They serve many beers on tap, and some fine dinners ($12-$18) from a very good kitchen. The clientele is generally pretty quiet, and dressed for an upscale evening.  There was some care put into the Wellington, which makes for a decent get-together spot in the King/Bathurst Area. The entire street has seen so much progress in the last couple of years that this could become a serious tourist destination very soon. I recommend it for a group, and it's certainly a great spot for a romantic date.  4 stars"}
{"text":"Best restaurant and patio in King West. New food menu is really good, not just boring pub fare."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday and it was one of the worst service experiences I've ever had. 20 minutes for the first drink! We ordered charcuterie and it was okay, but we never ordered anything else because of the terrible service. When we were finally able to find our waitress, we just got the bill and left."}
{"text":"Used to really like this spot but the last two times the service has been very slow and the food has been cold. Not sure if it's new staff but it will be a while before I would go back"}
{"text":"For the most part, the food is average but the atmosphere is usually great. They also sometimes do a \"bring your own wine\" for $5 (which is a great price).  In the spring / summer, the patio is usually busy and a great place to hang out with friends.   The price is moderate and the staff are usually very friendly."}
{"text":"Two stars for the Welly. Food is ok only. Absolutely nothing noteworthy about the food. Went for breakfast this am. Had the traditional breakfast with upgrade to a steak. It was good but I would not consider going here for breakfast if I weren't immediately adjacent to my condo. It is also the obvious local choice vs bier market up the street.  Wife had omelette which was below par, thick egg and lacked attention to detail. In fact, most items lack detail. Lunches and dinners I've had also are lacking the extra mile. Nachos are meh too!  Servers are nice but slow consistently. I'll probably be back here within a week. Welly is my default spot but that doesn't mean I'm happy about it!!!"}
{"text":"We were drawn to this restaurant because of the awesome patio but ended up leaving before ordering because it was so dirty and quite rundown inside. The table next to us was stacked with dirty dishes that nobody bothered to clear the whole 15-20 minutes we were there. The dishes that they had brought to us were greasy and had not been cleaned properly. Straw rappers and garbage littered the upstairs patio floor (we were there for brunch, not after the bar). We finished our coffees and left because we no longer had an apatite."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on the weekend. There is a sidewalk patio and a small second story patio.  It was pretty packed by noon (Sunday). I really don't have anything bad to say. The food was good, especially the hash browns - I love when they're fried and crispy on the outside.  It's not a fancy pants foodie brunch place, but this is reflected in the fairly decent prices for the location of the restaurant. The classic eggs benny was just that...classic. The bacon cheddar waffle with the apple butter was also really tasty. The Caesars were really good although you'd never guess there was a double shot of vodka in there! Can't go wrong for $6.50. I will definitely be back here as the weather gets better and I can enjoy the sunny patio!"}
{"text":"To be fair, I must first admit that this review is based only on a short visit to their patio for some drinks on a sunny afternoon. I've walked by Bar Wellington for years heading to other restaurants or clubs in the area and their long side walk patio has always been packed when the weather permits. As such, I've always had it on my to-visit list. We came as a group of three after trying to unsuccessfully get onto Gusto's patio. We had planned on spending the entire afternoon at Bar Wellington, enjoying the sunshine of a warm Saturday. We would run into a few things that veered this plan off course: first, we had just come from lunch and were looking to have some drinks and apps or share plates to split; there was nothing on their brunch menu (it was shortly after 2PM) that resembled anything shareable. Second, the service was terribly slow and the patio was only about half full; the bar was empty of customers inside. Third, the chairs were quite uncomfortable which would have been bearable had we gotten some drinks in us. Unfortunately, the pitcher of white sangria we ordered was so disappointing in so many ways. It was extremely sour and tasted (as well as felt) absent of any substantial amount of alcohol. There was no hint of sherry or triple sec or any other liquor in there, including wine! To top it all off, they filled the pitcher with a disproportionate amount of ice which left the distasteful impression that they were severely skimping out on the actual sangria. And as a side note, the washroom stalls are tiny with no amount of leg room - and this is coming from someone who is barely 5'1. Definitely will not be back, despite the prime people watching location and laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have never had a good time here. I've been several times for a professional group's monthly socials, and I have always found the service to be slow (and sometimes cold), and the food very mediocre.  The last straw was when I was there on a sunny afternoon and noticed, in the harsh daylight, just how filthy the carpet on the stairs is. There is no excuse for last winter's grime to still be there (I am writing this in September). This disgusted me so much (more for the lack of caring on the part of management than the actual dirt itself) that I am going to get our group to meet elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'll keep this review simple.  Good food, great atmosphere, and excellent service.  We usually go there for breakfast/brunch. Get the eggs diablo! Quite reasonably priced - for 2 meals, 1 soup, and 1 latte - it was less than $35 before tip."}
{"text":"We were there for a friend's birthday. We had a corner all to ourselves which is great. It's a cute small bar. They have a bring your own wine special for $5 on Saturday which is really awesome.   The food was ok with room for improvement: cream of tomatoes soup was more tomatoes paste as suppose to soup, the apple crumb was dry and tasteless, and, the salad was too heavy on the dressing. But there are couple of good items: The burgers, steak frites and chocolate molten cake were very good.   Overall, it was an enjoyable evening except for the waitress. She had an attitude. I asked salad, she gave me fries,and, insist I ordered fries...even though everyone around me heard me ask for salad. And, she forgot to bring the apple crumb (thinking back, we were probably better off NOT getting the apple crumb)."}
{"text":"I've only been here for brunch, but both times, I've consistently had great service and a tasty meal. ALSO the outdoor patio has a nice view of the park!   This time we had the quinoa breakfast bowl and classic eggs benny. Both were delish. I would highly recommend for your brunch needs."}
{"text":"From the owners of Bedford Academy and the now gone (but never forgotten!) Bedford Ballroom comes Bar Wellington. It's location one block south of King on Niagara is very convenient and it has a great patio for lounging with a drink and people watching. Also has a patio upstairs that can be used when the street level patio is full. Watch your head if you are on the patio, those pears hurt!  Drinks are fairly priced for the area, the beer selection is fairly standard though. I cannot comment on the food, but if it is the same as how the old Ballroom was, it is great. Favorites from back then were the nachos and sweet potato fries with chipotle mayo."}
{"text":"6 of us went there on Friday night. It's a nice and cozy place with a great patio. The service was prompt and courteous, and they were always happy to accommodate. The food was ok. I ordered the Prosciutto wrapped Steak on a bed of truffled mashed potatoes, and I was sourly disappointed when I found out there was not even a hint of truffles in my mashed potato.  I guess they skimp out of the expensive stuff.   Other than that we really enjoyed the atmosphere and the food and the service."}
{"text":"Great location and massive patio. In the core of King Street West, yet quieter. Great old-fashioned and good service. Will be a regular here."}
{"text":"\"Amazing experience!\" 5 of 5 stars  My very first visit to Bar Wellington was last night, we were a group of twelve and I can't say enough about how great of a time we all had. I'll start by recommending the double Caesar, excellent drink.  Everyone in our group enjoyed their entrees,which is unusual in a large group, there were burgers, prime rib, seafood pasta, steak frites, beef shirt ribs etc... Three of us had the beef short ribs, they are absolutely delicious! Our server was top of the line, she was gracious, friendly, genuine, polite, prompt, always there when we needed her without even being called. My other favorite perk is the corkage fee of five dollars per bottle of wine, I believe it's a Sunday night feature only, it made dinner for two with coffee a very affordable sixty dollars. When visiting Toronto or if you live here and want an awesome place to eat I highly recommend Bar Wellington.      Visited October 2016         5 of 5 stars"}
{"text":"I am a fan of this place not because of the food or the beer selection, everything is a just okay here. I am more appreciative of the old school feel of this place combined with a really nice patio area which is away from the crazy King Street noise and traffic.  Come on a weekend as usually any decent day after 5pm will result in waiting times for outside seating."}
{"text":"Love the patio in the summer, love the inside loungey-vibe for work lunches. Great place, great food. Scary-dangerous entrance steps though...  Edit: Owner was awesomely responsive and I can confirm they have indeed addressed the entrance steps! Much better. ;)"}
{"text":"this place is adorable and has a huge patio including a funky one upstairs. The menu is standard pub fare."}
{"text":"I've never liked the food here but it's always been a decent place for a drink. Yeah, not any more. I was sitting on the patio just for drinks and desserts - the service was brutally slow, the server ended up mixing up our orders, and the desserts were hideous (ps - the apple blossoms are tiny, definitely not meant to be shared)."}
{"text":"Visited last night, one of the last nights of the summer and the patio was awesome. Service was quick and very friendly, the rest of the crowd outside was fun, and the food (we shared flatbread & dips and chicken fingers & fries) was darned good. Close to the best chicken fingers I've had!"}
{"text":"I have been walking by this bar for almost a year now on my way to work. In the morning it always had that sad look of a deserted mistress, but on the way home, there couldn't be a more lively, warm feel to it.   Two weeks ago, over a few friday afternoon pints, my friends and I decided on this location as our place to go to for the evening. So on my way home I dropped in to make a reservation on their wicked patio. They said no problem and I went on my merry way home. 2 hours later, as I headed back to make my reservation, I was devastated that it started to rain... Bummed out that I was not only going to miss drinks on a patio but that I would be forced to stand, I headed back  to the bar.   I was so shocked when I arrived that not only had the hostess remembered me from before but she had taken it upon herself to set me up with a prime seat inside due to the damp weather conditions outside. My BF got to enjoy the game on one of their many TV screens and I got to admire that old architecture that encompasses this fabulous bar.   I had the chicken fingers and fries... delicious... and their drinks were amazing and cheap. For 5 of us to have drinks all night and a few of us to eat (and let me tell you, I was with 5 people who knew how to drink!) the bill came to a shocking $150. I was so pleasantly surprised.  This is a pub that  I can't wait to start calling my local."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink. Cozy spot! Chill vibe. Low lighting and lots of TV with sports. Beer selection has the usual suspects, no craft beer. Service was friendly and quick.   There are stairs to get into the bar and stairs to get to the restrooms, if stairs are an issue.  It's in a cool spot tho; I'm sure the patio is nice in the warm weather!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here for a drink and a quick bite after the Mad Decent Block Party on Saturday night around midnight. It wasn't very busy so we got a table right away but it still took a little while to get our drinks and food.   I got a beer - hop city Barking squirrel and a side of sweet potato fries to munch on. I wasn't a fan of the beer, I wouldn't get it again. It was too bitter for my taste. The fries were delicious (maybe because I was hungry) so that was a plus.   Next time I'm in the area I'll stop by and try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"The inexpensive price point is a good indicator of what quality to expect.    My steak was accompanied with an after taste. My sweet potato fries weren't crispy enough. More than half my dinner was left on my plate and I didn't take anything to-go.  I'm going to have to pass next time somebody suggests Bar Wellington."}
{"text":"This place really does have a lovely patio...when you can get a seat!  They have a nice selection of beers, but what really chaps my ass is the freaking WAIT for food and service. I have come here a number of times always hoping that the previous time was a fluke, but nope...it never is!  I have consistently waited 45 minutes to an hour to get my food.  The food itself is okay, reasonably priced, and good portions, but never, NEVER come here hungry, or you'll end up pissed off and drunk.  Not a great combination!"}
{"text":"Situated in the popular area of king west, the bar ample indoor and outdoor space. It occupies both the floors of what I guess used to be an old house with 2 nice patios (upstairs and downstairs). It has a perfect setting for restaurant-goers wanting to enjoy some food and beverage while enjoying the summer weather.   Food - lots of options. I was surprised that for a bar, it has a number of healthy options and caters to both veg and non-veg patrons. My boyfriend ordered the BLT with a salad which he thought was tasty and I ordered the Vallarta Antojitos (baked tortilla with spicy black bean and avocado served with sour cream and salsa) which too was pretty good.   Service - the hostess was nice and we didn't feel like we were forgotten at any point of time.  Will definitely plan on going back to enjoy the patio and the food!"}
{"text":"This review is for takeout only.  I ordered for Roasted Vegetables (recommeded in the menu) and Garbonzo sandwich. Both portions were large, enough for two people. The roasted vegetables were cut (or chopped?) in large pieces. While the veggies were roasted really well, there was a peculiar taste that was bitter. I could not make out if it was a veggie gone bad or a herb or improper dressing.  The sandwich was very dry and had to eat it with ketchup to balance. The chickpea fritter filling in itself tasted fine but overall sandwich was messed up.  When I went there pick-up I realized it's nice cozy bar, perfect for a winter night or patio in summer. I would probably give dine-in another chance. But for now it was a bad experience with take out food."}
{"text":"I had to drop this rating from a 4 to a 2! We went after our marathon run to celebrate but the food was terrible. Everything tasted and looked like they reheated it in the microwave.  I had the roast beef jus. The meat was dry and the bread was rock hard. A friend had the mac and cheese and it was oily and runny. So gross.  Consistency is a big part of the food industry which this place does not have."}
{"text":"Great people watching patio, service, food and drinks. Stopped in here on a whim for a drink with my mom and was pleasantly surprised. Brunch was still available so we split eggs benny over the kale salad. It was excellent! The kale was prepared perfectly, the dressing was just the right amount and the eggs were cooked as requested and very tasty. My mom and I were both satisfied.  I also ordered a caesar since it was brunch time :) It was delicious! I then tried the welly lemonade... so good! I highly recommend it! My mom tried a sip and then ordered one too. All and all great spot for a bite and a few drinks. The prices are very reasonable and at no point did we feel rushed or were we left wondering where our server went. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Pros:  - Takes reservations for the patio - Great patio. - Doesn't charge you 18% gratuity for groups larger than 6  Cons: Everything else.  Let me elaborate about the cons.  If you have a dictator boss who starts looming over your desk 2 minutes before you're supposed to come back from lunch break - you probably can't eat here.  I have never had a lunch here that's not taken longer than 1 hour to 2 hours.  The kitchen is slow.  The serving staff really aren't to blame.  Stick with the sandwiches here and you'll be safe.  I decided to not have a sandwich one time, and I ended up eating a cardboard-tasting \"potato salad\" with burnt asparagus and a dry, roasted chicken leg quarter.  It's dark meat for God's sakes... how do you screw up dark meat?!  Their chicken club sandwich is highly recommended and they do make a pretty kick-ass Caesar salad, complete with parmesan thin for garnish.  The sweet potato fries are pretty decent too as is the grilled salmon sandwich.  I'd much rather go to Bier Markt on King Street for a patio and better food, not to mention immense offering of beers.   Like Bobby N. I do like the \"old school\" feel of this place; the music; the movies they play on television.  But I'm not willing to sacrifice food quality for ambiance.  Sorry Bar Welly."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a brunch spot that's filled with people but always seems to have a table - this is it. It's not super pricey, and has a patio to tie up your dogs (if it's the summer... or the winter, if you're into that).   Definitely recommend trying any of their egg benedicts (but stay clear of the coffee)."}
{"text":"I live and work close to Bar Wellington and am always happy with my experience here. Service is great and the food is good - nothing mind blowing, but always consistent."}
{"text":"Great, great patio! A good place to sit out in the warmer months and people watch. This is a great place to go and have some beers after a tough week at the office.   But don't make the mistake of having a few too many and ordering dinner, because you'll regret it. The food here is terrible - I've had over-cooked chicken, bland nachos, gross fries.   I would not recommend eating here but its a great place to grab some drinks. They even have a patio upstairs and tons of seating if you're having a party."}
{"text":"Great patio in summer!  Food is so so, average bar food.  Drinks and vibe is good!  Will definitely be back in summer."}
{"text":"This is a review of Bar Wellington as a brunch venue. For patio this place is obviously a good option.  Brunch was alright, but nothing really special compared to other places in the immediate area.   The brunch menu stated boldly on the back that they had the best caesar's in town, or something. My wife had one, it was not. It was pretty watered down and flavourless. I would say worse caesar I've had really. Like one of those Mott's pre-made ones with a pickled bean added."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, friendly service and decent prices. My boyfriend and I went on a really busy Saturday night and still got our food relatively quickly and service was great!"}
{"text":"Brought a large group of people from my work here and things couldn't have gone smoother. Was able to reserve space a week in advance very easily through email (who actually uses phones still in this day in age?), and upon arrival they had room for us set up as their patio wraps past the side of the house and around into the back which meant tons of tables on what initially looked to be a full patio.  We focused only on apps and drinks but their beer menu is impressive with a nice mix of imports, domestics, and even a few craft brewed options. Everything was a winner and even with our large group service between drinks and such was never an issue. Its safe to say we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a rustic type of place because it used to be an old house which was then turned into a bar/pub. Because of this, space can be tight. I only got to see the ground floor. There was a constant rumbling beneath our feet which might have been the subway? I'm not sure. It was very busy when we went so service was kind of slow. The food was very good though - definitely a step up (or a few steps, really) from regular ol' pub food. Overall, it was okay. I'd come back if I was in the area but I don't feel an overwhelming urge to do so."}
{"text":"Best burger of my life. I will literally make the 8 hour trip again just for this restaurant."}
{"text":"We were here last night.  It was a great evening to spend on a patio.  Our server was super nice.  Ordered a strongbow (recent discovery), and the server introduced us to something grape-fruity and delicious (I wish I could remember the name).  So I would give the drinks probably 4 stars....  The food...oh the food.  I have never actually ordered such tasteless food.  Ever.  We had the calamari.  It actually didn't taste like anything.  It came with tzaziki (which had no garlic flavour, I thought it was actually sour cream, with a few chives).  We also ordered the sweet potato fries - classic, right?  wrong.  Tasteless again, they looked they they were sprinkled with salt, but they weren't.  The dip was good, but ketchup works just as well.  I'd probably pass on the food, unless you're starving.  I might try different menu items next time.  But it's a great place to hang out with friends, and for a few drinks."}
{"text":"This place is your typical good food, good beer, good drinks type of pub. Their cocktail selection is extensive, which I may not find at other pubs, so I was happy to see lots of options.  As for the food, i have only had the Portebdllo mushroom salad here, but for me to order the same thing twice is big. If you are a funghi fan, then you will be happy with two large grilled mushrooms served with roasted red peppers, seed, overl greens with a giant dollop of creamy goat cheese and two slices of focaccia with pesto spread. When its hot, it is good!  I have heard that the club sandwich, taquitos and yam fries steal the show here. I love yam fries so I'm just waiting for the right moment.  Thenlast time I was here, they informed me that they had steigl on tap.... And that it tasted like grapefruit form of orangina. I had to try it and boy was the waitress right. It gets pretty sweet and tangy towards the end, but can be awesome refreshing on the patio.  The service is always super nice and no matter the day of the week, its still pretty busy so you can't really go wrong."}
{"text":"food is good, bar is inviting, patio is good for people watching cause it's right on the corner, lots of walkers not much car traffic."}
{"text":"Great pub just poor grub.  This is a grand spot to grab a pint either sitting inside with lovely old style deco or outside on there crackin patio. Cozy in the winter and a nice sunny patio for the summer with really nice staff it must be said. Just don't come here for a nice sit down meal. I used to eat here all the time about 3-4 years ago, they had a lovely seafood pasta and deadly sweet potato fries but for whatever reason the food has really gone downhill the last two years. Every time I give the food one more chance it always disappoints. Shame really. But like I said a grand spot of a few pints."}
{"text":"Got greeted by two hammered men burping directly in my face. And the 3 dip appetizer was disgusting."}
{"text":"NOTE - This is a breakfast review:  Went in with my wife for breakfast. Immediately we're sat by a friendly bar tender, had a waitress come over and took our order within a few minutes....and that's it....nothing else, and I do mean NOTHING else. We sat there with our water for over 30min, waiting on an OJ (never delivered) and our breakfast. Never saw our server again and finally just gave up.   Love this place for drinks/apps in the evening, but will NEVER go back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Just met the owner. What a class act. The guy made a history book to celebrate his buildings history. Built in 1891. Great place for a nice pint with friends."}
{"text":"Love love love the delicious food!!!!!  Location: right at the corner of Wellington and Portland. Always lively in that area with lots of locals.   Food: Amazing!!!!!! Absolutely delectable !!! I ordered the salmon sandwich and a side of house salad (included). My ordered ordered the same but with fries instead. The salmon was perfectly cooked on the inside, and the sauce they combined it with was unbelievable. The fries were perfect! Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside with just enough salt on them. My sister ordered the chick peas sandwich with salad. The quantity AND quality for the amount you pay is great!  Staff/atmosphere: we sat outside on the patio which was nice and kept us enjoying the scenery. I stepped inside for a bit and was not liking the old bar atmosphere.  Staff was friendly. Service was good.   I will most definitely be back and bringing more company with me. Can't wait!!!   Hats off to the chef!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food! Tried the burger and the steak sandwich and it was delicious. Love that place for lunch! The waiter that we had was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I love the patio here! The food is consistently really good and the staff are great. Try the burgers they are delisious."}
{"text":"The food tastes good, volume of the plates is average (maybe not enough if you're a morning good monster). We've been disappointed by the service (slow and too many mistakes) but I'm giving 4 stars as the pricing is very wallet friendly. No line up for a brunch on the weekend, that's a PRO!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a cute little place!  I went out with friends for brunch on Saturday.  One of our friends said he had gotten lost a few weeks ago and saw this bar that looked cool.  So off we set in search of a bar that he found when he was lost.  I was skeptical, but figured I am always up for an adventure.  As we were walking I spotted Bar Welling and was like \"OMG WE HAVE TO GO HERE!\".  Luckily thats where we were headed!  The place wasn't crowded so we were seated right away which was nice.  Around lunch time you can get either the lunch or brunch menu which is nice.     The atmosphere here is awesome.  The staff are really friendly and the food isn't bad either.  The frites and breakfast potatoes were both amazing!  The hot chocolate is also good!"}
{"text":"I am highly impressed with the servers here. Polite, friendly, smiling and charming. I have always found that Toronto has lacked in service.   We came here for brunch on a Sunday.   I ordered the diablo Benedict, which came out in a HUGE tortilla shell on top of black beans with a side of guacamole and salsa. You could tell that the eggs are poached with water and not in a cup. I thought the egg portion was small, but thoroughly enjoyed the dish.  My friend ordered the egg skillet - it was tasty, but ridiculously small.   They have a nice selections of beers on tap - leffe.   Caesars were nothing great, but they were double for the price of one oz vodka.   Pretty pricey brunch for what you get.  I would come back for some pints. Its amazing how loud people get inside, but you can't hear it outside at all.   Someone mentioned they have a decent French onion soup, so I would like to come back and try it."}
{"text":"3.5/5. Was in the City Place area and looking for somewhere for Breakfast that didn't involve going to the familiar restaurants in the complex. We decided on walking to BW since I've heard decent things about brunch.   When we arrived, the place was pretty empty. We got a nice seat by the window. We ordered coffees which were really good, had some sort of cinnamon flavour to it. Really enjoyed it. For our brunches, we had Peameal Bacon Benny and I had the Denver Sandwich. The benny was just okay, I didn't really like the taste of the hollandaise but the egg was done nicely and the tomatoes and potatoes were good. The Denver sandwich was a great big portion. Only problem is the bread was super dry, and so was the omelette. I wish they put the cheese in the omelette instead of the bread. I liked that I was still able to get a side order of bacon with that.   Overall, the meal was okay and it was super affordable (2 coffees, breakfast came up to $30 before tax). Not sure if I will be back for brunch but definitely will for a drink. I've been here for a drink and it was a good time."}
{"text":"Tonight we went to bar Wellington (weird name) just for some casual drinks with friends. We managed to get reservations to sit on the patio which was a nice treat on such a nice night. While the company was great that's where it stopped.   The venue looks cute, and most people look like they're having a good time any time you're passing by, but the service is super slow, the staff isn't very friendly, and it's really tricky to walk around on the patio because they have huge umbrellas and not enough space for all the tables they have out.   As for food, we only got a couple orders of fries to share, and they tasted good and came to us hot, which is a good sign. From what I could see the other meals being served looked and smelled appealing but I won't comment any further than that.   As for returning, I may go back if someone else organizes an event there, but it would not be my first choice, though maybe we just got a bad waitress tonight..."}
{"text":"I met Gord at Bar Wellington after work for supper this evening.  We split an order of garlic bread.  It was hot and soft ... though tasty, it wasn't very garlicy.  Gord ordered mac 'n cheese.  The more he ate, the better he liked it.  I ordered wings with Thai sweet chili sauce.  They were okay, not great.  The sauce was good but the wings were overcooked so were too dry.  They definitely weren't \"jumbo\" ... there were nine for $12 and none were drummettes.  I wouldn't get them again.  We've had some good times at this bar ... tonight it was just so-so."}
{"text":"This is a decent place in this neighborhood.  Nothing great, but a consistently nice brunch offering.  Which is liely due to to the fact that few people come here for brunch.  It's clearly more a of a bar and it's crowded at night (and dark, and noisy, and slow), so I avoid it for that purpose.  But in the warm glow of the mid-morning sun (or the dull gray light of most days in Toronto) this is a reasonable place to get a bite to eat that, weather permitting, is quite nice on the patio.  Because it's off the main roads it's MUCH quieter than places along Queen or Bathurst.  I don't come often, but I haven't had a bad experience with this place as a brunch spot."}
{"text":"It is a very nice place. When I walked into it to meet someone, I wasn't sure whether my someone was already inside or not as may phone was almost dead but the waiters walked up to me asking me if I was looking for someone. Well eventually it turned out that the people they showed me weren't actually the person I came to meet but I was still nicely asked to pick a table and the person I was waiting for was brought to me (without asking) when he arrived. If I was not welcomed that way I might probably have preferred to wait outside in the cold for a good 10 minutes. And after that the. Beers just kept coming.  Very great bar I'd say. The ambiance is nice, the music is super nice.  No need to shout, talking is alright so for me that's an A+ right there. Loved it."}
{"text":"FYI non pork eaters.....For brunch you cannot substitute out pork for anything (not even a slice of tomato), but you can add a slice of avocado for $4. No price reduction offered for the removal of pork. Reason given \"plates are carefully constructed to a price point\". But with that logic if you remove the bacon, a price reduction should be offered? Our table just tipped less, so it all worked out, but still strange.    All sides offered on the menu are pork based."}
{"text":"VIBE  I really love the casual vibe here in a neighbourhood that is otherwise known as \"chi chi.\" The outdoor patio is really great and fun for people watching. I didn't know about their upstairs area until I was invited here for a group event. They also have an upstairs patio and a beautiful view of the CN Tower. *Toronto secret!  Staff were consummate professionals and on it with separate bills for over 30 people.   WE ATE/DRANK  There were a number of platters at this party. Fresh fruit, olives (can't say no to a kalamata) and a number of meats were all on hand. Totally worth the garlic halitosis to come.  What did I drink? Heineken of course.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK It's a bar. On Wellington. But a great bar with no pretension in a neighbourhood of pretension."}
{"text":"Oh Bar Wellington aka the Welly... I used to walk here in the dead of winter for a pint and a cozy pub to remind me of home.  I have had a lot of good personal memories here: - getting hit in the head with a falling apple and them bringing me a beer to make it better - 'bucket of blondes' - a few times - meeting a Russian mail order bride and a man with an ascot in the winter of 2008 in the back room.  Sarah T gave her a fake number.  haha.  The good: - The food is pretty decent - burgers are good, chicken fingers are sliced, diced, breaded and fried on site... well, maybe not diced... - The portions are huge - The patio is awesome - There is little staff turnover so it must be a good place :)  The bad: - apples fall from overhead.  It's very Newtonian (bop!).  I like to bring people here, see the apples falling, and quiz them about string theory and the infinite possible landing points of said apples in infinite parallel universes.  Actually, maybe this is the good. - I didn't really dig the steak frites.  It's thin bar-steak, but honestly, you shouldn't order 15$ steak anywhere and expect it to be good.  So it was fine.  The weird-and-amazing: There are always super random people here who want to be friends with me.  I have met a Russian woman who moved here to be with a man she had never met, flanked by another man who only spoke Parisian french so we didn't understand each other.  I have also met a guy who makes a living with those click-thru porno banners on websites who invited me to an 'after party' at his condo around the corner.  There was no party, we were just drinking at the Welly, so after asking a number of questions about his overhead and the viability of his business model, I declined.  Would I go here again? I WILL go here again, for sure.  Probably this month.  I may or may not have the chicken fingers."}
{"text":"Great patio. Everything else is completely mediocre.   Server was nice but it was a pain in the ass to get any service despite the patio only being half full. Took about 15 minutes to get some drinks ordered and it was 32 degrees outside so we were pretty desperate by the time they hit the table.   Decent cocktail menu with cocktails ranging from $8-$12ish.   Food (again, long wait) was pretty average. I had some kind of Tuscan salad with chicken, red onions and tuscan bread croutons. Prices here were average for King St West area."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. It's close by, it's cute and the menu looked great.  My husband took me here for brunch as he knew I was eager to try it. We ordered a coffee, muffin trio, and two specials. First off, the coffee was burnt. My husband drinks his black but wanted to try something new and added sugar and cream, even that didn't mask the burnt taste. Of the three muffins, which we split in half, the only really good one was the carrot cranberry one. One was a weird cookie that at first was yummy but after a couple of bites I wanted to just be done with it. The third was...I don't know what flavour it was. The maple butter that came with it was very yummy so good job on that.  Now for the specials. My husband ordered some sort of perogie dish. I have to say the toast that came with it looked great and was perfectly buttered. He thought the whole dish was very tasteless and a large pool of grease at the bottom of the plate was very unappetizing. I, bless my heart, I ordered the salted caramel poutine. It sounded so promising! I love to try new things and the server recommended it wholeheartedly. Boy was that whole thing a mistake. It was SO salty I couldn't eat it. A waste of what could've been a great dish because other than the sauce everything other component was perfection.  I was debating whether I should post this review because I didn't give the restaurant a chance to make it better. But there's nothing that they could've done to make it better. Even if the meal was free the rest of our day was sucky with the stomach aches we experienced.  Thankfully we are fortunate and we could write it off as a hilariously bad experience. This review is for the people who work really hard for their money. You deserve better."}
{"text":"Oh, the Welly. Always dependable for a frosty pint of mill street and a friendly bartender. Nestled at the corner of Wellington and Portland, under large trees and with the help of some wiley squirrels, enjoying a pint on their side patio could not be more pleasant. The interior is large, with a 2nd floor deck that can be used for large parties. I had my birthday party at the Welly this year, and there was more than enough room and no complaints from any of the guests. The food is a bit better than average pub food, but nothing too exciting. The beer selection is nothing special, but they have Mill Street on tap."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. I would come in everyday if I could but I don't want the people here to get sick of me.  It's the perfect neighbourhood bar with hassle-free drinks, good finger food like yam fries, tvs to watch your favourite sports, and decent brunch on the weekends.  I try to bring everyone here. My friends, my coworkers, my roommate, my dates. Everyone loves it :)  The bartenders are super chill and incredibly friendly, especially Lianne!   Coming here after a long day at work makes my day (half because of the beers, and half because of the atmosphere & staff)!  Will probably grab a drink here tonight."}
{"text":"Nicely tucked away from King St. W, offers a a homely atmosphere, rather than the large, dining hall-like restaurants all over Toronto. Good selections of beer, and both meals were tasty. On either end of the spectrum, the vegetarian dish wasn't bland, or a weakness of the establishment, while the steak was cooked as requested.  Only note that I have is that I would prefer to not have a mountain of french fries underneath my steak, it makes it difficult to cut, and is a bit unnecessary. Other than that, everything was great. I'll most certainly be back during the summer."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot!   I used to live next door and stopped in at least three times per week. Their fried brie app puts a smile on my face and the eggs diablo for brunch is fantastic! Their prosciutto-wrapped asparagus offered during happy hour is well balanced and their soups are all stellar.   But the service here might be my favorite thing. Mary, Steven, Ginger - the bar staff are all so incredibly friendly and on top of their game. Your glass is never empty and they're always serving with a smile."}
{"text":"This is the cheapest place to get a drink in the area. Went on a Friday night. There was 14 of us who were able to get our own space upstairs immediately. Good for large groups if you want to talk and get cheap alcohol. The music, at least upstairs, was pretty much background noise."}
{"text":"Stopped by for drinks late on a Tuesday night. When I say late on a Tuesday I mean early Wednesday morning.  The place was quiet, I enjoyed the ambience and service was fast.  A great spot for a low key drink.   I will be back for the rooftop patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Great spot for drinks on the patio. Food, however, takes forever, and is pretty bland. Ordered the chicken club based on Yelp reviews, but it was dry. Nachos were OK, but not overly flavourful. The service is great, and the atmosphere is perfect for a neighbourhood pub. Would definitely come here for drinks and people watching. Get your eats somewhere else..."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd year in a row that Bar Wellington have not staffed their place properly for Mother's Day. They know how busy it gets on that day as they also have to deal with runners from the Sporting Life 10k.  Additionally, I think it's pathetic that a restaurant in a city as diverse as Toronto does not have non-pork options for their breakfast. I ordered the \"Big Breakfast\" and asked for an alternative. They did not have anything to offer, not even a slice of tomatoe! They said I could add a slice of avocado for $4 which is highway robbery. And when we asked if the price could be adjusted they said on Mother's Day they can't make alterations to their menu because the plates are carefully constructed to a price point!.  There is a large segment of the population that do not eat pork and would appreciate alternatives or at the very least a price reduction. How hard is it to remove sausage from a breakfast and outline on the menu that without it the meal is $1 less (or some other price)?? I think it's a mistake on their part to miss out on this segment of the population and on principle I will advise people not to eat here until they can get with the times."}
{"text":"Couldn't disagree more with Maureen P's review (sorry Maureen)  Bar Wellington is one of my favourite places in Toronto and for price it has one of the best steak frites available. The sweet potato fries aren't crispy - I love that they come softer!  They have an excellent beer selection including my all time favourite - Leffe Blonde.  A couple of years ago I held my birthday party at the upstairs function room - free to book, and we ended up taking over the entire bar on both levels.  A great patio and a decent brunch menu adds the final touches to one of my go to places. Many fond memories here including drinking 10 Leffes and ending up singing tracks from Sister Act loudly with a group of friends and strangers."}
{"text":"Okay food, took a while for it to come out on an afternoon visit. Sangrias are pretty strong which is a plus. Other than that nothing special"}
{"text":"Pepper pitter-patters to patios periodically for play. Say that five times fast, and then consider frequenting this brick home turned corner al fresco haven. It's near your cool loft office and/or your pal's overpriced condo.   The Caesar comes with a pickled bean and a hot pepper making this bloody babe pickle-y and naturally hotter. It's nice. They have a massive tap list, too, if beer is your thing. I paired my cocktail with their version of a Caprese that I shared with a bud. It was kind of sweet and they used cherry tomatoes. Honestly, it wasn't my fave, but I can appreciate that it's a decent salad.   I enjoy their french onion soup in the winter, but this place is really all about their patios, so try to check it out in the warmer months."}
{"text":"The Bar Wellington, what can I say? THE FOOD WAS AMAZING! The meal I chose today was the BLT. The Bar Wellington made that sandwich very well! The sandwich was served on a warm plate and the sandwich itself was on a ciabatta bun that was crispy but not dry.  They put a spicy chipotle mayo on the buns to give it a little kick and I think they made the right choice by doing that! Also, the bacon, lettuce, and tomato were all very tasty and all had a lot of flavor too! The sides of this dish included fries or a salad, so I obviously chose fries. I think I made the right choice in this because the fries were fried to perfection and salted perfectly! I would have given the Bar Wellington 5 stars but unfortunately the service was a little slow for our liking but that could have been because of to many people being there or something of that kind. All in all it is a very good restaurant for whatever you may want it for, very good food for a very good price!"}
{"text":"Went here finally, for the first time on Sunday.  I pointed at the rooftop patio and said \"ooh I want to sit there\".  Five minutes later, I was sitting there.  /csb  It was nice though, as we beat the early-evening people and the after-jays people, so we (two of us) had it to ourselves for a bit.  Our server was nice and tried to crack jokes.  We didn't eat anything, but had beers and enjoyed the view.  My $20 bill almost flew away in the strong winds, and a nice man stopped it for me.  I'm a sucker for pubs that look like someone's old house, so I'll be returning here.  *Edited* to add that I added a star because I DID return here in December of 2014, the month of my birth slash  anniversary of my entrance to this world!  I asked them for a table for 10 or so people, and they gave me half the upstairs area.  So nice!  The two women working upstairs (sorry your names have slipped my brain, but I created that rhyme to give you my time) were super friendly and chatted with me while I awkwardly waited for my friends to show up.  \"I swear they're coming, I swear they're real!\" Yes I think I actually said that jokingly but I probably wasn't joking tbh.  When my friends did show up, some randoms did too but it's a super cozy seating area upstairs and doesn't get too loud.  The Christmas decorations were cute as well, the whole thing was just so cute and OMG CUTE OMG.    I will return here for a third time, mark my words."}
{"text":"I love this place for the drinks and servers. Not so much for the tables. Seriously, please get better tables so that if one of us leans on it we don't run the risk of having our drinks spill everywhere.  Anyway, the drinks are fairly priced and had a good variety. Our server was so friendly, always checked up on us to see if we needed a refill or anything else.  I will come back here if I am in the area."}
