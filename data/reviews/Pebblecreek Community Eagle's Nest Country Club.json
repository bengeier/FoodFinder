{"text":"Had two lunches here with our parents, who are members.  It's within a 55+ community.  My son had the steak sandwhich, which was delicious.  I had the fried clam tacos, which were pretty good.  Other son had the burger, which he said was excellent.  We loved the fries.  I also had the patty melt on another occassion, which was very well prepared.  Good beer on tap there, too.  We ate outside with a beautiful view of the golf course and pond."}
{"text":"we had my mom's 70th surprise party there last weekend in the Palm Room.  the food was delicious and atmosphere was warm and friendly. Our event coordinator, Crystal, was such a delight and very professional over the several weeks of planning.   My dad had zero experience in planning such an elaborate party and Crystal was patient and helped him work through all of the details so that my mom had an amazing night.  My dad decided to buy centerpieces but didn't know where to go for that. Crystal referred him to Jacque at Thee Wedding and Event Warehouse.  The centerpieces were simple and elegant and my dad was grateful for the referral.  Overall it was an evening to remember for my mom and the family, and Crystal/Pebblecreek made that possible!"}
{"text":"We held my mom's surprise 75th birthday party in the Palm Room at Pebble Creek in August of 2017 and held our wedding in the Chianti Room (Tuscany side) in October.  Both events were beyond what we ever dreamed they would be.  Our event coordinator Crystal Thomas was probably the biggest reason for that.  Crystal was so amazing to work with - she thought of every detail and was helpful every step of the way.  If you are ever looking for a wedding venue - this is the place!  Kudos to the staff and chef - the food was exceptional and the staff were professional and friendly.   Thank you Crystal for your help in creating some of the best memories we will ever have!"}
