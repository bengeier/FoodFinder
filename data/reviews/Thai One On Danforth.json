{"text":"AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE. 

Yelp should seriously consider letting people give zero stars. Never have I had such a frustrating experience with a restaurant, or food in general.

Ordered $40 worth of delivery tonight, which consisted of:

1. Green Curry Beef
2. Lemon Grass Soup
3. Curry Shrimp
4. Glass noodles.

The delivery time was double that advertised. All in all, we waited for an hour and a half. When the food finally came, we were all so appalled!

The curry shrimp, which was $13, consisted of a measly 5-6 shrimps. And they were just the regular supermarket frozen type you can get at Nofrills, not the \"tiger shrimp\" as advertised.

The glass noodles were clumpy and oily. The chicken was dry and tasteless. 

The lemon grass soup ($6.99) had a few slices of mushrooms and 4-5 shrimps. It was also unacceptably spicy. We dumped the whole thing down the drain. 


The curry beef was simply disgusting. For $12, we got skimpy slices of low grade beef which were overcooked. 

3/4 of the food ordered simply went down the drain/garbage chute. How this restaurant manages to survive with their abominable food and service is simply beyond me. But there are much better Thai restaurants in Toronto that are worthy of your patronage. This one simply does not make the grade by any measure. 

Disgusting."}
{"text":"Never ever eat in. This location seriously does a disservice to the franchise. I'm positive they only make money through delivery hence, don't know how to handle in-house service. 

We walked in and sat ourselves. Took at least 10 minutes for the server to come out and bring the menus. While we were looking through the menu, all we could here was the server arguing with another coworker in the back. Not just a normal argument, raised voices and all. Finally she came back, we ordered spring rolls to start and our mains (Spicy basil noodles and golden curry w/ coconut rice). Food itself was sub-par. Rice was overcooked. Terrible experience, I won't be going back.  And the arguing continued sporadically throughout our meal. I should mention, we were the only ones inside."}
{"text":"That huge banner mentioned by the previous reviewer is still there. In black marker, they wrote valid until Oct 31st (no year) so I thought it was valid. It was not despite it saying 20% off online, take out or dine in. This place should take down it's banner or provide the discount to customers who bring it up.

As for the food, extremely greasy. Probably great for post-nightclub alcohol soaking. Portion was small for the price. $11.99 for noodles with chicken. For the portion, $8.99 should be sufficient, especially given the area. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Idk about everyone else but I love this place. Curry pad Thai is my go to. Always delivered quickly by polite people and never a bad ordering experience. Also had the red chicken curry and it was amazing! Try it."}
{"text":"The delivery time was extremely long. But the food came hot. I wouldn't have cared but he didn't even say sorry for it taking an hour and a half. I paid a dollar for extra sauce and they didn't even fill it."}
{"text":"The food and service at this location has increasingly become worse and worse. After waiting for my delivery order for an hour and a half (after it was promised in 45 minutes), I called to figure out what was going on. The employee informed me that she was \"just about to call [me], because the delivery driver is running late.\" She then tried to insist that the order was received 20 minutes later than my confirmation email from them, so obviously I had to wait the extra 20 minutes they were screwing around, then another 20 minutes for the \"delivery driver.\" Not once was some form of apology or compensation offered. Not a \"I'm so sorry for the inconvenience/confusion/mistake\" at any point. Just a \"yeah so the order was here and the driver is late sooo......\"

Really disappointed. I used to enjoy this location."}
{"text":"WARNING: NEVER EAT HERE!! I worked here for a couple of years. The dishes are not fully cleaned (soak it in a sink filled with dirty water), they \"wash\" the vegetables with a dirty cloth they use to clean the tables, I needed change once and they gave me the money and went back to preparing the food! I would get one free meal every shift and ever since I saw that I was disgusted. They use the dirty mop to clean everything and never refill the water. I went downstairs to get napkins and found a sleeping bag! There was so many times where I wanted to warn customers never to eat here.

They pay $8 an hour and paid under the table. Mohan, the owner at the time, did not pay me for a month of working there (as well as the other employees). I spoke with the new owner about this and he told me it's not his problem and to find Mohan to get the money. However, he gave the money Mohan owed the other employees their money. I was furious! I went all the way to a sketchy convenience store in Morningside and he locked the door the moment he saw me. I never got my money. 

They cook treated me like shit. They made me feel dumb and never gave me a proper training. Every time a customer complained about the food, the cook would yell at me. The person opening the store was always late so I would have to stay outside in the cold until they arrived. I got a concussion and was not medically capable of working. Despite that, they were extremely inconsiderate and forced me to work. I quit right after."}
{"text":"Under new management and wow, they are terrible. 

Spring rolls full of BURNT vegetables. They reeked like burnt food so bad when I opened the box. First one was barely edible, I gave up. Second one was absolutely disgusting. Ripped it open to find everything inside was charred to a crisp. REEKED like burnt food. I've eaten a million spring rolls in my life, that was NOT normal. 

Called them up to complain and ask for a credit on my file for my next order. Had to speak to FOUR different people as their English was so bad. Here was my conversation with the \"owner\".

Me: \"I picked up take-out 20 minutes ago, my name is Amy. My spring rolls are completely burnt inside and smell terrible. They are inedible.\"

Owner: Long pause. \"Not burnt. Black Mushroom! It's Black Mushroom!\"

Me: \"Excuse me? I'm not an idiot. The vegetable inside this spring roll taste like burnt sh*t and are black from being burnt beyond  recognition. Everything inside the spring roll is BLACK!\"

Owner\" \"Wait Okay?!\"

Person 2 and 3....repeated same thing. Ridiculous

Person 4: \"They are black mushrooms ma'am, it's not burnt.\"

Me: \"WHAT? Are you kidding me? I know what burnt food looks like, smells like and tastes like! You either give me a credit on my file for spring rolls if I dare to come back or I post this on Yelp and you take your chances!\"

Person 4: \"okay, we can't give credit. we give free spring rolls next time\"

I had to tell him to take my information and put it on my file. I doubt he even bothered. The spring roll was disgusting and never in my life have I encountered a spring roll like that. I don't know if I will bother going back to this Thai One On location. It has TERRIBLE SERVICE and their kitchen is awful. How hard is it to sautée some vegetables for a spring roll? 

I don't know what is going on in Toronto but more often than not my restaurant experiences end up with disgusting food or the wrong order. This city needs a serious restaurant over-haul. 

Spare yourself. Save your money. Go elsewhere. These people are rude and couldn't give less of a crap about your experience at their establishment."}
{"text":"There is fish sauce in everything, including the items marked vegetarian. The staff just shrugged their shoulders when we politely questioned the ingredients and said \"well that's how we make it\" and refused to take it off the bill. My friend orders vegetarian menu items because she has a fish/seafood allergy. What if there had been a severe reaction?"}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. It's rarely busy, so service is quick and efficient. Food came out at a reasonable time. We ordered the green chicken curry with coconut rice and chicken pad thai. 

The green chicken curry comes with a generous amount of chicken and vegetables. The basil leaves are a nice touch, too. The coconut rice is saucy and so, so, so yummy. A little pricey at $3.99 a bowl, but worth every penny. The curry and coconut rice go very well together. 

The chicken pad thai is also very good. Comes with a mound of ground peanuts that go very well with the noodles. The pad thai is also saucy. I love saucy thai food! Mmm. Good amount of tofu and chicken, which was nice. The fiancé found the pad thai a little too sweet, but he also enjoyed it very much. 

This location has some great weekly deals (buy one get one free fried rice on Monday and buy one get one free pad thai on Tuesday). They also offer 25% off on take out orders of $40 or more, which is a steal. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place has dinner special almost everyday so I gave it a shot today. I got the samosa and coconut mango chicken with rice (around $12 after tax). I ordered take-out and the package looked very nice, the place gave a nice feeling too. However, the food was tasteless and the quality was too poor for the price."}
{"text":"This restaurant is at the top of my street and I have always enjoyed the food - takeout or dining in. My hubbie and I even took guests here for NYE. Sure, the female staff were occupying the one stall washroom to get ready to party after their shift but they were happy to leave for me :) 

The portions are huge. I always have to finish in 2-3 rounds!"}
{"text":"Pad thai had some potential but the noodles were loaded down with way too much sauce. The folks at the next table also mentioned the same problem with their pad thai. Maybe they had a novice cook starting out that day? Service was quick but a little confused, the server didn't clear my dishes off the table. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant opened in Summer 2013 or so, so you'd think they had the kinks out by now - especially since they are a franchise. A friend and I ate there the first week and waited well over an hour for our food, while an upset customer who had come for pick-up waited about 45 minutes longer than they had said it would be.

We ordered takeout  recently and was told that it would be ready in 15 minutes. We got there in 20 minutes and it wasn't ready.  There was no one in the restaurant so maybe other takeout orders were holding it up but reviews elsewhere suggest that they just have no sense of how to prepare food in a timely manner. 

We got hot and sour soup which was tasty and full of vegetables but not \"hot\". The fried rice wasn't fried and the red curry chicken wasn't at all spicy either, despite the fact that it was supposed to be.
A large (removable) sign outside says 20 % off but it was no longer in effect, we were told. The paper menu said 10% off for pick up, but that wasn't in effect any more either, it seems. And the quantity was pretty small for the price."}
{"text":"Pretty lame. Ordered red curry chicken yesterday, and they left out both the snow peas And any sort of spice  when I requested it to be spicy. It looked and tasted like they'd waved a chili pepper at a coconut milk and vegetable soup. Veg was quite overdone also. . It arrived in a timely manner, but for a $15 plate this was pretty bad."}
{"text":"Last week I went to the Thai One on at the Danforth location.  It was a walk in.  I ordered two of the lunch special combos and one from the lunch express.  I ordered a Chicken Devil which is $9.99 (and comes with a rice).  For this he charged me $12.99 and argued that the price was correct.  I order this all the time so, I know the price.  I asked to see a lunch express menu and was told that they were all out.  I paid the $12.99 + for the combos.  When my food came, I was about to walk out but stopped to check the bag.  No rice.  Finally got that and left.  When I got home, I checked the menu that I had and yes, it was $9.99.  They had over charged me.  And when I checked the container, it was half full and there was a lot of cauliflower and other veggies and very little chicken.  When I called in to complain, I was told to come back and I would get a refund.  That same day, there were other customers who, after looking at the menu, asked for the lunch menu and was told that what they were looking at was the correct one.  They left because the prices were not correct.  

I returned back today to get my refund.  I ordered food and presented my receipt from last week and was told \"We cannot give you a discount\".  I explained that I was not looking for a discount but a refund.  I was told there is nothing that we can do and we cannot give a discount (he did not understand the issue).  I was fed-up and told him that I will not be coming back and that the bad reviews that they were receiving were what they deserved.  

I do not want a free meal.  Just better service and honesty."}
{"text":"Delivery was very fast.

Green Chicken Curry was excellent.

Pad Thai was not good at all.  You could taste the ketchup and lots of vinegar.  I thought Toronto Thai restaurants were past this?

I sent them a discrete email with feedback and wrote that I thought that was more appropriate than social media - but received an error message that the email didn't go through.

So then sent another one to both locations, and received another message that both emails didn't go through.   Pretty frustrating all around."}
{"text":"Got delivery through Tasteaway and it was great! So much better than our usual Friendly Thai delivery.

We ordered:

- vegetarian spring rolls
- fried tofu
- red curry vegetables
- Thai vegetarian spicy noodles
- Thai basil tofu
- sticky rice with peanut sauce

Delivery was friendly and on time. Will order from them again!"}
{"text":"Terrible in house service. Took almost 10 mins for the server to come give us the menus. On top of that my food arrived right away while the rest of my table waited another 30 minutes. Avoid this location ."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through Just Eat. Came on time, was hot. Chicken satay like tough leather, flattened and dried out beyond edible. The satay sauce was bizarre and not peanutty. Hot and sour soup...I should have known, it's Thai, not Szechuan. It was sweet, hot, and boring. The coconut soup was equally bland. Unimpressed."}
{"text":"Pricy and totally not worth it. Ordered two appetizers (samosas and beef satay) and one soup (lemongrass + coconut milk). Samosas were 2 in one order, and they were the saddest little things. Barely any filling, the pastry on the samosa was so thick and over cooked I could barely bite into it. Not sure if they were fried too long, refried too many times, or just old. The satay was $7.99 for two, small, stringy skewers of extremely tough, overcooked meat. I normally would like my meat cooked well done, but this was almost impossible to bite into and chew. The peanut sauce had almost no seasoning, and did not save the flavour of the meat at all. The lemongrass coconut soup had some good flavours, but was unlike any I've had before at other Thai restaurants. The colour of the soup was off-putting, and the mushrooms floating on top were disgusting. Very small portion for $8.99. Delivery took about 1.5 hours, but that was probably the best thing about this entire meal. Not sure why this place has such a high rating on Just-Eat (the only reason I ordered in the first place). Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I order online once and while, one of the best asian foods I have ever ordered for delivery. The fried rice is awesome and huge! All of the meat dishes from beef to chicken I have ordered were great, definitely a higher end Asian food place. Their food isn't the best after it's reheated."}
{"text":"FOOD:

CON: Pad Thai is not that good. Thai Express is better for sure. Disappointing coz they are pricier than Thai Express.

PRICE:

CON: A lil bit on the expensive side.

AMBIANCE:

PRO: Nice ambiance, very roomy.
CON: Roomy coz it will probably be only you who's dining in there, kinda gloomy vibe. Most of their customers do a take-out order. 

SERVICE: 

PRO: I usually do a take-out here so I can only say that they have a nice service in terms of take-out order, they're fast."}
{"text":"Incredible food. I've eaten at a lot of Thai places in Toronto and this is up there with the best. Also, serving sizes are about 1.5 times bigger than the norm."}
{"text":"Not reccomend. They were playing loud rap music until i asked for a switch. Waiter wore shorts tshirt n flip flops. Rice was extra charge. Ginger chicken super salty n taste like soya sauce. although i was only guest waiter did not return to ask how i was. Seems to be run by east indians who perhaps not that familar wth thai food. I could hear staff yelling at each other in back. Decor wood panelling n dead plant."}
