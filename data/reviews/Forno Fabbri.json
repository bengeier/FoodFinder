{"text":"I love coming here for lunch... It's the best casual Italian place in Scottsdale! The pizza and panini are great and the desserts are awesome!! I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"The dough is a perfect pillow for sauce and toppings .  Crispy on the bottom and chewy provides the perfect bite.  Authentic Sicilian style slices.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. The pizza dough was tasteless. And the service was terrible. We dine out as a family frequently and never experienced such slow service. We will more than likely never dine there again."}
{"text":"A mozzarella bar where you can't get mozzarella (or bread or italian lunchmeat--until dinner.  Poor, confused service."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic.  We read through other reviews and decided we wanted to have more of a low-key night so we decided to hit Forno as opposed to Pomo (attached next door).  This was definitely the way to go and was like something straight out of Vernazza.    While we just did the cheese and meat sampler along with a couple of other small plates, the pizzas we saw come out of the kitchen looked great.  The cheeses were outstanding and the quality of the prosciutto was amazing.  The owners were very friendly and loved to chat.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Not a good experience.  We went there in mid December because I wanted the peppers and eggplant dish that was highlighted in the paper on December 7th. The waiter said  he wasn't familiar with the menu because he only works on the other side. He thought that dish was not available after 3:00 but then he checked with the kitchen and it was OK to order.  One daughter had the mushroom soup and it was very good.  My other daughter and her friend ordered a margherita pizza and a pasta dish to share.  The pizza came out way ahead of the pasta.  There were 3 big basil leaves on the whole pizza and the crust was soggy. The rest of the food was served except my peppers and eggplant dish. About 5 minutes later the waiter brought me eggplant parmesan. It was pretty good, but then my husband called the manager over and a few minutes later he brought out the peppers and eggplant dish. And after all that it was just average. The manager did not charge us for the peppers and eggplant and offered us a free dessert which we declined.  Nothing was good enough to warrant a return visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I would not have known about it except for the article in azcentral about Pomo Pizzeria being one of the 10 best pizzas in the Valley. Looking at the website this morning, I saw the site for Forno as well. They are the only place in town to find a cornetto con crema like I had on my recent trip to Italy! This place is a true slice of Italy, walking in I immediately felt like I was back in Rome or Florence. The pizza is awesome, the selection great and the cornetto was perfect! I highly recommend Forno and if you have not had one before, get yourself a cornetto con crema, they are delicious!"}
{"text":"Great venue, food outstandingly, server Landon excellent, very attentive, friendly. Will definitely return and spread the word.  Jim"}
{"text":"Amazing! I had the Caprese sandwich! So fresh! So delish!  The olive oil guy came over with a sampler plate and all of those were so flavorful too!!! I'm pretty sure I stepped right into Tuscany! I love that most of the employees had thick Italian accents when they spoke! So authentic! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Had a wonderful Caprese salad (that was cut and layered properly) and the Rice Balls.... 1 word - Outstanding  I will definitely be back to try some other items.  I loved the market items set up against the one side so you can purchase items to go if you want."}
{"text":"Best mushroom soup ever!! Despite living in the hottest city in the US and being the middle of summer, I could eat this soup daily. The caprese panini is also outstanding! Great spot for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I had the Cotto Focaccia Sandwich and Wifey had the Italian Club Panini. We both love our food. The wine pairing that was recommend by Antonio was excellent as well. The service was outstanding as well our server was julia and she knows what is great to eat any day of the week."}
{"text":"We read about this place on a top ten list for Italian restaurants. We knew it was by the relocated Pomo Pizzeria but didn't realize they are basically the same restaurant until we arrived. Our one experience with Pomo was not positive so I wasn't excited. It appears that Pomo has been improved from a quick view of the menu but music and other noise came through the shared entrance and made the meal more hectic than I would have liked. The food was good. There were two pasta specials and we each tried one and were pleased. We shared tiramisu for dessert  it was very good.  There is a decent, fairly priced wine list. We had a Sicilian Chardonnay. We liked it. I also had some chamomile infused grappa which was an interesting experiment not to be repeated. Service was good. I have mixed feelings about the Italian market as my wife got $74+ in olive oil during the lunch hour.  We had a good, expensive lunch. I think other places are as good but not as noisy. We will probably go to one of them the next time we want an Italian lunch."}
{"text":"Another wonderful evening of light Italian food When I was much younger pizza and beer was a Friday night treat. Life is better - now it is authentic Italian pizza and Italian wine. Life is good"}
{"text":"We stopped in one afternoon for a quick lunch while our dog was being groomed at Mackie's Parlour.  Friendly staff, comfortable place and delicious food.  We both enjoyed a pizza and a San Pellegrino - perfect for a mid-day snack."}
{"text":"This place is a definite destination restaurant just as much as Pomo.  The eggplant was a dish that i could every day for the rest of my life.  It's a treat to have a restaurant here locally that feels like you're stepping into italy."}
{"text":"For an Authentic taste of Italy Scottsdale AZ might be your closest spot. According to the Forno Fabbri Website they received an Italian Certificate that meets the certification for Italian Foods. It means the recipes, ingredients, and machinery used are certified Italian and have the same values, characteristics and use the same methods of the past and without modification or alteration.  I started with a slice of Margherita Pizza Romana. It was only $3.75 so I thought it would be a little square but it was big enough to be a meal. It was simple and not heavy. It was made with the flavors you know and expect.  My husband started with the Pasta & Fagioli. Neither of us ever tasted a version of this classic soup that we tried here. Here the Pasta Fagioli was a thinner vegetable based soup that was only very light with seasoning and flavor but did have a good amount of beans in it.  I had the Tonno Salad. ($6.75) (AKA Dieters Platter) This was maybe the lightest salad I ever had anywhere. I knew being priced at $6.95 it would be on the light side. All it was were fresh mixed greens, some sliced onion, tomatoes, some Italian Tuna and maybe a spoonful of Extra Virgin Olive Oil mixed threw. No seasonings or spices were added. Very very simple and very VERY light.  My husband had the Piccante (Hot Calabrese Salami Sandwich). He didn't ask what the rosa sauce was and just assumed it would all be good to him. He asked the server what the sauce was and she told him it was ketchup mixed with mayonnaise. I don't know if the server was correct or not about those ingredients. My husband's Father is from Italy and raised his children (my husband)  not to eat things he didn't eat in Italy. I don't know what Italy is like today but in my father-in-law's day according to him Italians don't use mayonnaise and many other American Condiments like ketchup. SO my husband asked the server if she could do something about removing the sauce. She said she'd make him a new sandwich without the sauce. He enjoyed the new sandwich very much and said the salami in it was really VERY very Good.  This is a small casual place including a small Italian Grocery without produce.  If you are modest you might want to avoid the ladies restroom. It is clean and attractive but the wall between the stalls is only semi-transparent. I don't want to draw you a picture about it. Just use your imagination.  3.5 Stars rounded up out of respect for what they are trying to do."}
{"text":"A perfect complement to Pomo for those evenings that you want to explore the more casual side of Italian dining.  An ideal place to go when you want the quality of Pomo but you are dragging along a couple of kids."}
{"text":"What a nice restaurant, glad I tried this place out! The little Italian market was closed, but I still got to walk through it and it was cool, I'll have to come back.  Service was good, everything arrived in a timely matter! Was worried because I ordered a pizza on the gluten-free crust, which is supposed to take longer, but there was not much of a wait. I got the marinara pizza. Honestly, it was so good, it did not even need the cheese. Topped with sliced garlic..perfecto!   Everyone else in my family was satisfied with their meal as well, we definitely had leftovers. One cool thing was when we were leaving we got to do a drawing-type thing, and we got a coupon for a free pizz! Woop! Love free stuff.  I will be coming back to redeem that coupon for more yummy pizza."}
{"text":"Great casual place you can eat every night. The pizza people love, but not  me. Too soggy in the middle.But the salads,and the Caprese are wonderful. The lasagne is frozen and not heated enough.sometimes it's still cold in the middle.they need a larger pasta menu.very limited.oh and they never changed the grilled veggies. Same and boring. Get to the market. Service and Manager are great.   It's next door to Pomo. Same entrance but go to your left.there are some tables for 4. A big community table and a counter with 6 chairs. It's a nice setting and not noisy. Both place have same menu. I prefer Fabri.good service.they make their own pasta. It's excellent. The salads and antipastis are also excellent. Pizza is authentic from Naples with special flour cheese and other things. Some people love this type of wood burning neopoliton pizza. It's wet in the middle. Hard to pick it up with your hands. Falls apart.  Mangia   middle.not"}
{"text":"A fun place...reminded us of being back in Italy. Great big wine glasses and an excellent selection of Italian wines. It is kinda cool of having a \"market and mozzaerella bar\" ciao. grazie. But, they really need a Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Where do I even begin? The atmosphere was perfect, the warm Tuscany smiles made the service perfect, and the food was simply sublime. You must discover this place for yourself!"}
{"text":"Best Panini I've had. Coming from the east coast you take for granted the Different Italian restaurants but really pleasantly surprised to find this gem in the middle of the desert! Soup, salad, bread all delicious. Haven't had the pizza but it looks great. CHECK THIS PLACE OUT PEOPLE!"}
{"text":"Forno Fabbri is a slice of Italian life. Their delectable pastries and cappuccinos remind me of the true Italian style breakfasts I used to have in Florence. Their lunch menu (available until 5pm) is affordable and extensive, featuring items such as soups, salads, pizza by the slice and sandwiches. Their paninis are to die for. My two favorites are the crudo baguette panino and the caprese foccacia panino. The kale romana salad is incredible. Their very authentic \"pizza romana\" is something not often seen stateside, but definitely worth checking out. If you're curious about the mozzarella bar, meat balls and cheese boards, be sure to go after 5pm to see that menu! The team of Italian servers know their stuff and make excellent wine pairing suggestions. It is also worth mentioning that they are unfortunately closed every Sunday, which is something unmistakably Italian as well."}
{"text":"While the food was very very good, the service was extremely slow. A friend of mine and and I visited about 1230 Pm today on Tuesday and while the place was not busy, the only waiter seemed to take his time. All we ordered was a soup and a prosciutto Positano panini and it took over 20 minutes for the food to arrive.  The soup, a red tomato gazpacho looked fabulous and tasted just very fresh and yummy. The panino, with prosciutto San Daniele, fresh mozzarella, arugula and parmesan was fantastic and a huge portion, probably enough for two people to eat. It was served with a very small side green salad and balsamic vinaigrette.  So the only letdown of my first experience at Forno Fabbri which labels itself as an Italian market and mozzarella bar (mozz bar nowhere to be found) was the speed of the service. The market sports imported olive oils, tomato sauces, biscotti, juices and pastries."}
{"text":"Italian spoken here!   Delighted (now) that we missed the new burger bar and wandered round the corner to find this little gem. Adjacent to Pomo, this \"market and mozzarella bar\" offers a wonderful variety of dine-in and to-go options at fair prices. So many choices: bruschette, Sicilian meatball/polpette, soup/zuppe, insalate/salad...) You can taste the quality!   I'd had my heart set on a burger, but that craving quickly subsided with one taste of my husband's tricolore pizza and a sip of Sangiovese. I anted up with an order \"fior di latte\" mozzarella and a glass of Piedmont Chardonnay. Then, of course, added the homemade bread. (forno fabri) Luca was our host; he was helping w/our pronunciation while we enjoyed one of the community tables. (Of which there are three... As well as counter space, outdoor seating & 2 four tops.) Luca knows just a little bit about wine, it seems! I bet you can ask him anything and he'll know.   The market section is two rows: offers bottled soft drinks, juice, pellegrino (of course), cheeses, oils, vinegars & assorted lotions/aromatic products.   Such a delicious & delightful spot that shouts, \"Prego!\" ... Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Wine, Coffee, Dessert"}
{"text":"The prosciutto and homemade bread  sandwich may have been the best I've ever had. Service is good and efficient but not overly friendly. The market is cute but the items are expensive.."}
{"text":"Amazing in every way from the layout to the service provided in the food and drinks prepared.  Truly authentic and a slice of hidden Italy in the middle of Scottsdale, who would of figured."}
