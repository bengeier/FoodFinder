{"text":"We ordered the large pulled pork, it came out to 35$ with tip and delivery.  The pizza tasted good but was pretty much a medium anywhere else.  I rated them low due to value for price.  I am now going to order another pizza from Matadors.  I wish we had a 2 guys and a pizza place...."}
{"text":"I cheated on Lorenzos with Pizza Bob's and I immediately regretted my decision. I will never do it again. The crust is so thin and hard you can break it with your fingers rather than rip or pull it apart. The pineapple just fell right off each piece because it was on top of the cheese. Overall the cheese was the only good part. It reminds me of a pizza you could buy at the grocery store and heat up at home, you know, its not horrible but if you had the option to get hot fresh pizza from a pizza place you would never eat the grocery store pizza."}
{"text":"It is early on Mew Years Eve and the place. Is getting ready for fun and ring in the New. year.  The band is setting up on the smallest stage I seen so it will be intimate   The place is a great adult joint    Bob the owner is making his rounds meeting and greeting.    As far as service the young servers and cashier are the politest I have encountered  anywhere. The Greek salad is amazing.    Fresh crisp and a good portion for my sweetheart and me.  We ordered two small pizzas to compliment the salad the Amy's favourite and The Croak of Bull.  The Best thin crust you will ever enjoy.  Come on by and enjoy a nice cozy experience  you can bring your own wine too"}
{"text":"This is a cute little spot that was hopping when I visited on a late Friday night.
We ordered at the front It was a little chaotic, but the only person at the front counter was doing his best, and helped to take our order there. 
I ordered the veggie pizza, and my friend the popular pulled pork pizza. I loved the thin crust and the veggies piled high, with just the right amount of cheese.
What sucked was the 45 minute wait. . . I was gnawing the crap out of my straw in hunger. We didn't see a server once while waiting for our food, while we sat at a booth, but I'm not sure if that's normally how it goes, it was hard to tell what kind of place bob's was. . . Serve yourself pub/performance space/ neighbours hood dive maybe? Needless to say, when I'm in the area again and craving pizza, I'll hit bob's up again."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! The cook/server was super friendly. It's a hidden gem and we would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, my fave in the city. 

Atmosphere is mellow and relaxed keeping tone with the part of town it is in. 

Takeout process is a breeze too.

All in all best pizza in town to stay or to go!"}
{"text":"Pizza  Bob's  is a destination  recently  discovered  as I have  moved  in nearby.  The Margarita  pizza  as an \"appiie\"  is to die for...!   . Quaint  ambience  makes it a nice place to go  and relax & not worry  if you used the right fork to eat your salad  with ..lol  !  Going  back again.!"}
{"text":"Firstly, you MUST get past the state of the decor, I mean the outside looks better than the inside. If you can get past the looks of the place  the salad and pizza will blow your socks off. The pizza? By far the best in town, resonably priced and 100% organic unbleached flour used in their crust, being gluten sensitive, this flour does not upset my stomach like the other crummy flours. We were in there during YYC pizza week and we tried their \"Stir Pie\". Needless to say we've been back several times and have tried different pies, generally they are all good, but the Stir Pie is still my favorite. The greek salads are also VERY good. This has become our go to spot for pizza and lastly who doesn't like free corakage? Bring a bottle of wine from home and two of you can eat for less than $30. What a deal!! Definitely a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"We traveled from the SE to try this NW neighborhood spot because we heard they offered free corkage, not something you find very often in Calgary.  Pizza Bob's was a pleasant surprise.  It is a cozy little self-serve restaurant in a strip mall, with ample parking.  There isn't any wait staff so you have to order at the counter.  We had the Calabrese pizza, which was excellent.  Nice thin crust pizza, lots of flavorful toppings and not overloaded with cheese.  To accompany our dinner, we brought our own bottle of wine and simply picked up two wine glasses at the couner.  Thursday and Friday nights they offer live music.  The only down side is that the pizza is a bit pricey.  However, all in all, if we lived in the area, we would probably make Pizza Bob's our regular Friday night out spot.  We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Gross soggy pizza with grey meat...yuck."}
{"text":"My wife and I have driven past Pizza Bob's many times and even more when it was Tom's, but for some reason we never got around to trying it until tonight when we decided to give it a shot.

We had read reviews, so we knew to order at the counter and we also checked out the menu online in advance so we knew what we wanted.  I can see where non-regulars might be confused by the lack of waiter service.  

I had the Porkie Pie and my better half went for Amy's Favorite.  We also shared a small Caesar salad to start.  The salad had a home made dressing that was garlicky but very tasty (carry some extra strong breath mints if you're going to talk to people after!).  The romaine lettuce was cut larger than bite size and didn't come with a knife which made it a little challenging to eat but it hit the spot while waiting for our pizzas.  My Porkie Pie was good but the slice I snitched from my wife's Amy's Favorite was even better.  The pineapple and peppers were fresh and made for a very enjoyable variation on a Hawaiian pizza.

While the staff mostly stays in the kitchen area except to bring out your food, when we talked to them they were all happy and friendly.  The people at the other tables seemed to be regulars and the vibe was that this was a friendly neighbourhood family restaurant.  Some reviewers have said that the pizza isn't true Neopolitan, but we liked it and will be certainly be back for more."}
{"text":"Wanting to grab a quick bite, my friends suggested Pizza Bob's since it was close to their place. It's set up cafeteria style - order, pay up and seat yourselves. As a true Yelper, I checked in as soon as we got thru the door and I got a check in offer for a free small pizza - SCORE! They honoured the deal with no hesitations; we got a small Hawaiian and a medium Calbrese (Calabrese Salami, Red Onion, Red Pepper, Italian Sausage & Goat Feta) to share.

The pizzas came out piping hot and I was excited because they were thin crust! There was a perfect ratio of ingredients to sauce to cheese. The crusts were crispy and both pizzas were flavoured really well.

They have a huge selections of classic pizzas, I can't wait to go back to try a few more."}
{"text":"We love the thin crust pizza! Soooo delish! No matter what you pick you won't be disappointed... And don't forget the wings! .. From that oven they taste awesome!!!! You should go!"}
{"text":"oh boy.

I like pizza, I like it a lot. But I like pizza that has the love. I really don't know what is happening at this place.  It's in my hood and I had high hopes.  I knew about the walk up service from other reviews, so that was no problem. We went up and ordered, and as we were doing that I noticed the prep station behind the bar, the person prepping pizzas had a stack of crusts that were just to perfect to be made in store. If pizza is what you're selling, then step it up and make your own signature crust.

As for the toppings...everything on this thing was out of a can. Not a lick of fresh ingredients and the crust was, as I assumed it would be, tasteless. 

I dunno what to say. I'll likely never try the pizza again unless they make major changes, there are so many places in this town doing thin crust and doing it well. I might come back for beers, but the place was dirty and the clients there were a bit boozed out and abrasive. So yeah, probably not. But...yay free corkage?"}
{"text":"Love this place.
We go regularly on the weekends even though we live in New Brighton. My husband usually has to drive home because I drink too much wine (bring your own wine if you eat pizza- no corkage).

We've tried about 5 or  different pizzas and they have all been very very good."}
{"text":"Little pizza place on the corner I drive past all the time. Had the Amy's favourite and \"the special\", both were thin crust and very tasty. I will definitely return to try there other pizzas. Prices were ok, fellow behind the counter was friendly. It was clean, but a little dark."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible food with an equally disgusting restaurant. We stopped to get a vegetarian pizza, never had gone there before. The inside was pretty ratty, but in defence I have had some great food at ratty restaurants but not so here. We got the pizza to go. When they handed it to us it wasn't even hot. We took it into the car and opened it. OMG! everything was thrown on top and it might have been scared by a very small piece of cheese.

Yes. it was not hot, it did not even smell like a pizza, well it didn't smell. The crust was thin and nasty. I thought for a second that I was eating burnt cardboard. The box looked more tasty than this dumpster diving special. The price was beyond astronomical for such an appalling supposed meal.

I had one very small piece as did the other person. The rest went into the garbage and we went somewhere here and had an edible, tasty, hot pizza with cheese on it.

The parking lot had a hole that would have eaten my whole Matrix if I had drove near it.

If I could give this place a-5 stars I would but the lowest I can give it is one star."}
{"text":"Really good thin crust pizza. We had the special with tomato spinach and sausage. Atmosphere is not great but the pizza is service very friendly"}
{"text":"Dropped in with a group and it was OK I suppose.  The pizza I found was boring but heavily laden with (bland) toppings.  The self service pop was handy but I felt they lose money by not having table service since I never felt it was worth the effort to order a highball after my first.  Having said that the free corkage is insane and I'd probably bring some wine next time making the night go smoothly.  The chicken wings were very bland and if I paid half the price is still have been disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered Chicken Lasagna and left  after  3    bites. The pasta  was extremely gloutenous and sky  like GLUE  . Obviously  from being grossly overcooked  or   being  stored  weeks in fridge ! I left and was not even  asked \"how was  your lasagna\" . One would think that  if a customer  leaves after only  a few  bites of the meal, the staff MIGHT wonder  why. I would NEVER order and pasta dishes here again."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but NOT Neopolitan. Talk about SELLING OUT :( 

I've had some great pies at Pizza Bob's, but am very disappointed after seeing the new sign front claiming this is Neopolitan pizza.

ARGH, WTF?!??!?! This is most certainty NOT Neopolitan pizza! Furthermore, why would the owners want to SELL OUT and jump on this silly trendy Neopolitan bandwagon, when they have a relatively unique pie that can stand on it's own without having to put some trendy BS label on it? (and I say *relatively* unique, because this pizza is esentially a Tom's House of Pizza clone).

Owners, WTF are you thinking? your reputation has been severely downgraded IMO. BOOO!"}
{"text":"Just finished the \"porkey pig pie\" that was one of the finest pizza's I have ever had! Recent upgrades to signage and the big flat screen LCD are nice. Great lunch spot!
$16 something for
1 personal pizza
1 soda
1 tip ($2)"}
{"text":"I'm not too sure about the quality of the ingredients that this restaurant uses, but the pizzas taste great.  Even the gluten free pizzas are awesome.  The pizzas are on the pricier side, but definitely worth trying out. However, the decor of the place and vibe are somewhat unusual and there is no service so you have to walk up to the till to order."}
{"text":"Wow! About time I tried this place! Was going to dine in but in came a brood of screaming toddler kids right behind our booth so we were out! Pizza tastes just as yummy in the car when starving. Just make sure you try it hot and bring plenty of napkins! Sooo good! I ordered a small veggie with the firesauce option, regular crust. They do have gluten-free if you need or prefer that. Me, I like my gluten :) I saw a sign that they do vegan as well.
The pizza was fully loaded with veg - it was like a fresh salad atop crispy crust, the kind of crust with bits of corn meal at the bottom of it.
No service here. Walk in, grab a menu and order at the counter. Pizza is super fresh, made to order. A small will run you $12, a large $24. Nothing in between but they do have appies like garlic bread, wings, etc. It was busy enough but the pizza only took about 15 minutes to make.
I will definitely go for take out again, the location headed to the NW from downtown is very convenient."}
{"text":"FREE CORKAGE EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK!  A Great place if you like good pizza and great, down to earth people.  It's not fancy by any means, but pizza is and free corkage is definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"The pizza and staff are great. Old place, more of a 'dive' feel. But the pizza is amazing"}
{"text":"Pizza Bob's feels like your friendly neighbourhood pub, except instead of being a pub, it's a pizza joint! They serve up some delicious brick hearth baked thin crust pizza in all the classic combinations, as well as so more forward thinking pies like the Mexicana and the Pulled Pork Pizza. 

I went with the Mediterranean Dream, a special competition pizza for YYC Pizza Week, loaded with artichokes, black olives, spinach and a hummus sauce. While you might not be able to get this pizza outside of this week, Pizza Bob's creativity and commitment to tasty 'za will definitely still be there for you!

They sell wine, have a great selection of bottled beer and get this - No Corkage! That's right! you can bring your own wine with you! Bob says he'd rather just make and sell incredible pizza and if people want to bring their own wine so they come and eat his pizza, they're more than welcome to! Fantastic!

I left feeling like I need to go here more often. It's a friendly, down to earth environment with live music on some night, a host of regulars and I want to be one of them!"}
{"text":"So thin crust yes isn't made in house so I think they could do better, but for a cute little pizza joint it can be over looked because I don't think they are tying to be some haute' pizza joint. The pizza sauce is delicious and they have quality ingredients. The staff were friendly and bantered with us just the way we like it."}
{"text":"Our friends kept inviting us to this pizza shop for a couple of years so we went with them last Friday night.
It definitely is located in an out of the way small strip mall that you would generally drive by. The sign out front is well located but was in need of some new bulbs to illuminate the sign. Had he sign been lit up, we wouldn't have had to drive by it the first time.
The restaurant is small but was surprisingly full of people. There is a small stage in the corner where we were told some bands play and  occasional karaoke contest.
We had the Caesar salad which was good but a little more garlic than anticipated.
Our pizza was s delicious with generous toppings of anchovies which sometimes can't be found at other establishments.
What this restaurant really sets itself apart than any other restaurant is the free corkage.
If your looking for a relaxing evening out with friends, quiet enough to hear conversations, and have your pizza and your favourite bottle of wine, then this is a good place.
This is a down to earth, nothing fancy establishment where it's come as you are. No need to get dolled up!"}
{"text":"I switched to bobs a year ago because they made the old fashioned thick topping pizza instead of this new crappy thin crust no topping pizza craze. I ordered gluten free for a year and was impressed by the one inch thick of toppings.  For the third delivery in a row now I have received a thin topping cheap pizza for $40.00.  I've complained with no success, I'm done, might as well go back to Avatara"}
{"text":"Is this place fancy? Nope. Do they have awesome pizza?? Yup!! Thin crust, not crazy expensive...and the best part... you can bring your own wine in...no corkage fees!"}
{"text":"This place is not the upscale type of dining but it's great pizza!  nice thin crust yummy pizza.  had a fun crowd of friendly patrons. people have no problem talking to you and had a great time each time I visited.  fun karaoke and would go again sometime it's been awhile.  good delivery or take out too."}
{"text":"Good thin crust pizza. We had the special pizza. It has spinach tomatoes and sausage. Not much atmosphere but a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Finally finally finally made it to Bob's.  I've lived around the corner for 3 years now so I know I'm delinquent in finally experiencing the awesomeness that is Bob's in house dining (done take out but first time to eat in) but now that I have it will be a regular stop for sure.  The first thing I noticed was the number of families that were dining.  I love that this is a family friendly restaurant and that so many people in the neighborhood support the business.  The dining room is small and has the tiniest stage I've ever seen.   Curious about karaokee (thanks Thea) but have yet to make it out for that event.  You order at the counter and there appears to be some amazing honour system to pay on your way out.  I am a terribly honest person and would never wander out on a bill but I'm in awe that a business can run this way.  Again speaks to the business and its customer base being amazing.  The thin crust is crispier than I expected having experienced a very different version of Neapolitan pizza but I liked it.  The toppings are fresh (ham and pineapple for me) and I am not a ham person but I loved the thin tasty ham they used.  I've read some complaints about the toppings falling off because they aren't glued on by a layer of cheese.  No such complaints from me.  I liked that there was just the right amount of cheese and if the toppings fell off I just scooped up and let nothing go to waste.  Beer selection is decent with some unique bottles I had not heard of and whoo hoo that was a decent pour on my cocktail, thank you!  So if you haven't given Bob's a try, do it!"}
{"text":"No. Don't do it. 

Overloaded toppings that come off when you pick up a slice and an overly baked, dry thin crust with NO chew that resembles a water cracker in looks and taste. Pizza Bob's has made me worry for Calgarians...is there no good pizza in town?"}
{"text":"Wish we had bothered to try these pizza's before!  The pizzas are a good size (not huge) and I love the really thin crust.  Definitely worth a try if you want something that tastes home made."}
{"text":"The pizza strikes me as being quite healthy. No greasy, oily business and very fresh ingredients. The gluten free crust was decent. In fact it seemed remarkably similar to the regular crust. Overall quite good, but lacking in savouriness and flavour. I guess that's where grease comes in hand."}
{"text":"Que lugar tan quedado en el tiempo! Sucio! Viejo !!! Esperaba más con los comentarios que leí!!! Muy feo!"}
{"text":"Free corkage? Free small pizza with a Yelp check in? What?

This place is quite cool. Was craving pizza and wine a few days ago. Lo and behold, Pizza Bob's magically appeared in my Yelp searches. 

Their pizzas are completely filled with toppings so you know that they don't cheap out here on food. The atmosphere is super laid back. Bring your own wine as an additional bonus (just ask for glasses at the counter) and you are pretty much a pro by now. 

Pizzas go for $25 for a large one which is plenty to share for 2 people. 

Will be back!"}
{"text":"I went for take out pizza, mainly because on the sign they advertised some organic ingredients.  It's a very thin crust, with quality ingredients and I found the pizza very flavorful and delish. 

Might not be enough for those with hearty appetites-they only have two sizes, the largest pizza being 12 inch. If I was a drinker bringing your own wine would be a bonus."}
{"text":"I had heard really good things about the pie at Pizza Bob's, however I was underwhelmed.  While having a creative selection of special pies, I found our pizza to be rather bland.  We ordered the The Chicken Garlic supreme, the pizza was topped with chicken, pepper, and roasted garlic.  However the sauce had little flavor and the garlic didn't add any flavor.  I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"I call this 'grown-up' pizza.  Nice thin crust, nice goat mozz (and just the right amount!! - i hate those places overload your pizza with greasy cheese), good, fresh toppings and good selection.  If you're doing take-out though, be aware the 'large' salads are not that large.  We had to add to ours with things we had in the crisper at home. Still, we fed 6 hungry people on 3 large pies and 2 salads.  And we were all pretty satisfied.  I like this over chain pizza places anyday!"}
{"text":"Rob & I recently came here because we heard Pizza Bob's accepts Calgary Dollars, which is good because we collect those. So when we first walked in (my first time) I was expecting a high-end Pizzeria, but was startled to see it's more like a 'friendly neighbourhood pub'. To order, one must first look at their menu, then walk up to the counter and order that way, then sit down and wait. Oh, and if I remember, they gave us our drink glasses and there's a soda machine in the lobby for us to do it ourselves. Ask first if you want to refill it though.
We each got our own small pizza. I forgot what he had, but I enjoyed a delicious thin-crust garlic & chicken pizza.
I also noticed there was an air of community in there, like everyone knew each other :)"}
{"text":"OK most of the reviews sofar are generally correct.

The pizza here is actually pretty good, overloaded with toppings, and thincrust style. GO up to the counter and serve yourself, neighborhood pub feeling, etc. All this is accurate.

The thing everybody forgot to mention, is that this place is WAY OVER PRICED!! Like I mean to the point of being obscene! If I go there for a jug of your AGD and want a bite in my head Im thinking I gotta leave to go eat somewhere when Im IN a place that serves food!! Hahah!

 Pizza Bob, please do something to lower your costs on stuff so you can lower your food prices man (pizza especially!!). If you ever want to get the odd NEW customer who also comes back and stop the ship from sinking, you gotta do it ok?  Also, PLEASE cancel the Karaoke good grief it sucked in 1994 so by now its a dead dead dead horse as a form of entertainment, seriously. And if you hire a band, please overlook the Bill Dowey  over rated  generic stuff.

And bring your own wine with no corkage fee? Huh? IS this your hangout joint or a business!! LMAO!!"}
