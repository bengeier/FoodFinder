{"text":"I was not impressed by the chicken teriyaki or the avocado & cucumber rolls. Entree was supposed to come with vegetables but what I received was three microscopic pieces of cold broccoli arranged in some sort of flower pattern and of course sticky rice. Very misleading indeed.The sauce on the chicken was absolutely watery and gross. Maki rolls were not fresh and it took quite awhile for the food to come out. The place was empty that night FYI - but generally I felt ripped off and left hungry."}
{"text":"I'm only rating Ebi Sushi based on take out... particularly their chirashi take out (aka Signature Chirashi), which is my measuring stick for how I judge my sushi restaurants because that's my favourite thing to order. So yeah, if you care about chirashi, read on. But if you are looking for a holistic view of the restaurant, of all the food and the dine-in experience, this review won't help you.

The chirashi has a good assortment of fish, including a decent amount of red tuna, shrimp and roe. Also nice presentation with the fish rolled up and some garnishes of lemon and parsley. There was also fried egg in there which is different and it was alright tasting. There's a decent amount of sashimi on the bed of rice, but it could also be the same amount as other places but just thinly sliced -- because it was all thinly sliced. So for every two pieces, it probably equaled to one regular piece of sashimi. It tasted fresh though so can't complain about that. The rice was also a nice consistency but it was simple white rice, while some places spiff up their chirashi rice with some seaweed and whatnot.

The Signature Chirashi meal costs $16.95, which for dinner prices, is on par or cheaper. I can't seem to find a lunch portioned and priced chirashi on the menu on the website but maybe there is one. However, most places (i.e. all) I go to for the chirashi, they always come with miso soup and a salad. Here, at Ebi Sushi, it doesn't come with either. Which is a bit weird to me. Fancier sushi places like Sushi Moto uptown to cheaper places like Big Sushi in the Annex have always included the soup and the salad. And when you're paying about $20 with tax, I'd think that it wouldn't require adding it on as extra. I thought because I was using a third-party delivery service that somehow my order just was missing these two things but then I went on the menu, and sure enough, it doesn't look like it's included. It's not the end of the world and it's not like my life is dependent on the miso soup and salad that comes with a chirashi meal, but it's a bit of a bummer."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and always great customer  service!! Sometimes the maki rolls are huge but they are always yummy. Sushi nachos are a great addition to the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi at very good prices.
It's fairly new in our neighbourhood, so we had to stop in.  Thought the sushi itself was of excellent quality, and tasted great.
My wife and I ate 'til we were totally stuffed, with appetizers, drinks and sushi for $30 - we were very pleasantly surprised to get great sushi and an excellent overall meal for so cheap.   We'll definitely be back.
Strongly recommend this place...check it out!"}
{"text":"These guys do an amazing job. In many ways, they're a typical sushi place on Bloor St.--affordable, with a similar selection of rolls as other places.

However, the service is incredible, especially if you have allergies. They offer gluten-free tamari sauce and are very conscientious about cross-contamination. The servers are always polite, informed, and professional. It's seriously such a pleasant and reassuring experience. I usually get the tuna belly and Ossington roll. Really enjoyable."}
{"text":"This is my go-to local sushi joint. Unlike the Annex cluster of sushi restaurants - which are all perfectly good - Ebi Sushi is a step above in quality and presentation. The rolls are big and well-constructed, with lots of filling and a moderate amount of rice. The spicy scallops rolls are a nice change from the usual salmon/tuna offering. The unusual selection of inari sushi (marinated tofu pockets) is great for vegetarian friends. 

Especially noteworthy are the spicy sashimi \"nachos\" with wonton crackers. It's an unexpected dish, a weird cross between salmon sushi and chips and dip, but the play of spicy sauce, fresh salmon, crunchy salty wontons, and a touch of acidity from fresh lemon makes it a surprise favourite."}
{"text":"I really liked the sushi and the atmosphere of this place. The fish was fresh and delicious as was the miso. The service was great too. Overall very positive first visit. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love good sushi at a good price. It is not easy to find, but you will find it at Ebi.

Tender, fresh fish, excellent value.  Highly recommended.  I particularly love the salmon tataki."}
{"text":"After reading mainly positive reviews, we decided to make a last-minute reservation for 4 people on a Saturday evening @5:30pm. It was a little busy (a good sign!) but certainly lots of open tables as well. Probably didnt need the reservation. I liked the ambience- spacious, well-lit and pleasant at our table by the window. 

Service was good and the place is even kid-friendly. The server brought water and I liked how he brought a covered cup with straw for our kid. Bonus! He came to check on us a few times throughout the meal and was friendly. He even brought tiny spoons for tiny hands.

We ordered Assorted Tempura ($6.95) and a Medium 50-piece Mixed Sushi Platter ($49.95). The tempura batter was crunchy and light. The sushi was really fresh, though the platter was a little heavy on maki and light on sashimi. The rolls were a little loosely made; however, they tasted great. I thought it was a little strange that some items like the Tako and butter fish sashimi came with only 1 piece which means you have to fight for that piece! Also, I thought the Medium platter was a bit too big for 2 people, so next time I think we'll try the Chirashi and a couple of apps, or go for the Small platter. The meal came with complimentary miso soup. 

We finished the meal with some green tea and mung bean ice cream (yum)! 3 scoops for $3.95.

I'm glad we tried this place. We'll go again!"}
{"text":"Got some take out from Ebi tonight and was very happy.

Service on the phone was quick, easy and personable.

I ordered the wakame salad and calamari to start - wakame was good, the usual seaweed salad you get everywhere. The calamari sauce was delicious but the calamari itself was pretty lacklustre.

For my main I ordered the extra small platter which was a selection of sashimi, sushi and maki - it was delicious. The fish was very fresh and the lowly california roll seemed elevated. Very pleased!!

They don't offer brown rice, but that's not a huge deal.

Great food for a really great price point (lower prices than Rikishi just down the street).

Can't wait to order more."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Really friendly service, very fresh fish and the portions are very large. Its always a pleasure to eat at Ebi Sushi.

I don't think they have all you can eat but I don't mind."}
{"text":"Oh Ebi baby. You used to make me forget about sushi from the west coast. Now you're just forgettable. I used come back to you week after week. Now I don't ever see myself coming back to you. Your service used to be quick and attentive. Now you just look dazed and confused. Why does a small sashimi plate take 45 minutes to be ready? Did you go out and catch the fish yourself? 

You still get 2 stars because what we had meant something to me.

To top it all off, the waitstaff suggested that we switch our items to salads since it'll be \"ready faster.\" I can't even..

I'm going to Mazz sushi down the street."}
{"text":"Rolls were massive! Mostly good, except for one 'fishy' tasting tuna. My partner and I definitely had food poisoning afterwards."}
{"text":"I had takeout from here a few weeks ago. Everything was fresh and delicious. Particularly the Chirashi, which came with about 7 very fresh pieces of sashimi and delicious rice. I suggest ordering this dish without the scrambled egg. The egg was slightly metallic tasting. 

The prices were reasonable considering the quality of the fish. The Toro was a bit disappointing.   

All in all, I recommend Ebi sushi."}
{"text":"As someone who takes Yelping very seriously. there was no way I would have passed up the opportunity to eat at a sushi restaurant with the window sign \"Grand Opening\" especially when I'm with another Yelper. It also just so happened that we were both craving sushi anyway. 
So in we went, and immediately I could see myself liking this place with their nice bright deco (reminding me very much of Etsu on Baldwin St which I love), friendly staff welcoming us in and an overall clean feel to the restaurant. 

The menu had just the right amount of options not choosing to go overboard and while I wouldn't call this place a very cheap sushi restaurant it can still give you enough for a solid meal for the $15 price point. 

Ordered a combo sushi lunch along with a couple of handrolls which contained what possibly might have been the freshest avocodo I've had at a sushi restaurant. Full marks for their presentation (check out my pictures) and the quality of the rest of my meal was great. And we were also treated with a couple of Japanese fare in the form of cold beef and salmon dishes as appetizers although I forget what it was called (also pictured). I enjoyed them, but probably would not order them as a menu item? And their take on the standard salad and miso soup also stands out in a good way. 

Ebi Sushi turned out to be another great little find, it is always a pleasure to eat at an affordable sushi joint that pays attention to customer service and quality of food! A re-visit is definitely in the books for me!"}
{"text":"I love Ebi Sushi! I've been ordering take-out from them on and off for about once every week over the last year. It's consistently delicious and fresh. I would agree with other reviewers that some rolls are occasionally loose, but the flavours are perfect. My usual order (for two people) is:

- Vegetable Gyoza (pan-fried)
- Spicy tuna or spicy salmon roll
- Katsu Donburi
- Salmon sushi 
- Butterfish sushi

The salads are also delicious, and the special rolls are really large and impressive looking. The sushi pizza is also amazing - large chunks of salmon with avocado. 

They also have a ginger honey tea that is such a treat. I think they marinate the ginger and honey together, and then it needs to be stirred once it arrives at your table... it's really, really good.

Eating at the restaurant is a pleasure; the staff are always very friendly and the decor is warm, modern and clean overall. 

One night when I ordered take out, the staff forgot to put the butterfish sushi in the bag, so they called me to let me know and were very apologetic. It was inconvenient for me to go back to pick it up, so they offered to deliver it to me instead, which was really nice seeing as they don't do delivery. The server arrived within 10 minutes. I was very pleased. 

In my opinion this is the best sushi in the neighbourhood; I've tried most of the other places (that look appealing to me). Other reviewers mention that it's too expensive etc., but when it comes to sushi I think it's important to know you're eating higher quality fish from a clean restaurant, so I think the prices are on par with the quality and I'm happy to support the restaurant. I hope they continue to do well!

Signing off,

{"text":"Had been there a couple of times and it was good not great, but went this weekend and it was pretty terrible. The rolls were loosely packed a fell apart, the fish wasn't fresh and the service was awful. Won't go again."}
{"text":"Nice place and the food is pretty decent.  Not the best sushi I've ever had but by no means the worst.  The speciality rolls are larger than most other sushi places so order accordingly.  The fish was very fresh too.  On the downside they overcooked our edamame somehow.

Rikishi Japanese (just east of Ebi) has better food and menu but the service there is very, very slow."}
{"text":"I'll make this short and sweet. I basically made this account just to talk about this great place. I've basically overdosed on Sushi places and am out of love with most of them. But Ebi Sushi deserves to get this shout out. Not only am I still in love -- It's one of the few places I've been to that has a lone female Sushi Chef. It got points right there before I even ate anything. Her Sushi is fantastic and HUGE. I repeat HUUUUGEEEE. I've been there several times and you will always get your money's worth with Ebi Sushi. It really is East meets West with her portions. The staff is made up of nice genuine people. 

So with that stop reading my review and go try the place out! 

(WARNING: Do not take dates you suspect will only eat half of the plate I was NOT joking about their portions.)

Good eating all!

{"text":"A girl once known as Ebi took me to Ebi, and I don't think she knew just how much I love places like this. I really love quiet, nice, kind, serviceable sushi places. 

+ Sashimi appetizer of tuna and salmon for $7
+ Lobster tempura roll for $12
+ Edamame
+ Gyoza

Nothing quite feels like a feast like sushi. I welcome the bloat post fresh fish chopsticking. The seaweed was for the first time in a middle of the road sushi place as recognizably from the sea. I don't think this will blow you away much but it will be healthier than a hoagie, and make you feel like a pauper."}
{"text":"All non-basic rolls are $9.95 and up!  No bento boxes. This place gets more and more expensive with less value in the qty. and quality of food. I can't see it lasting much longer. Place is always empty."}
{"text":"If you're into mountains of mediocre sushi for a miniscule price tag, this is not the sushi place for you.  And honestly, that's what makes Ebi Sushi a breath of fresh air.  The prices were reasonable, the portions were generous, and the sushi was AMAZING.  Everything seemed very fresh, even down to the creamy, not crumbly wasabi garnish.  I walked away perfectly full and not at all upset that I picked up the cheque for two of us that night... it was just over $20 for a great meal."}
{"text":"WOO HOO! 

I was so worried I would die in my new neighbourhood, as the concentration of sushi restaurants is so low (i.e. only one or two, before I lived in Chinatown!!) - then Ebi Sushi opened! 

This is a brand new spot that had opened only a few days before my visit, and I was impressed! 

Decor: Very nice, traditional feel but really clean and modern - I heard a rumor (aka a google search told me) that the owner did the art themselves (very nice personal touch) 

Service: unreal - super friendly and helpful, attentive with tea and water, and gave us a few freebies to snack on pre-meal

FOOD: delicious!! They have a great selection of lunch specials, rolls, a la carte, and cooked options. Since I was there for lunch I took advantage of the Sushi, Sashimi and Roll set - it came with soup, salad, agadashi tofu, tempura, a hand roll... the list goes on! Everything was super fresh and delicious, and the price was right at $12 for the fanicer lunch option. 

My only concern is that this quality / price / deal / service is going to go downhill over time - so it's my plan to take full advantage while it's still awesome, and hope it stays that way! 

Ebi Sushi - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went out to dinner tonight with my boyfriend a great quiet date spot with amazing food. Recommend spicy salmon nachos so good !! Great price and amazing stuff super nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Too expensive for me!  Other places in the area aren't open for lunch, which is why I tried Ebi Sushi.  Not a lot of variety on the menu, and the prices are too high, although the sushi is good quality."}
{"text":"From the outside this restaurant looks a little sketchy but once you step inside the decor is very nice. But the food is AMAZING! The sushi pizza is a must try, it has a little amount of rice and tons of sashimi chunks and is topped with an avocado. The rolls are very big so order one or two less than you usually would. They have the best spider roll I've ever tried. I would definitely come back here and recommend!"}
{"text":"I have a feeling Ebi Sushi is getting extra praise as it is the only sushi light in a raw fish dark zone. Christie Pits was majorly due for some decent sashimi and Japanese treats. 

Enter Ebi. A clean, perfectly cute restaurant with all of the delights you'd expect from a Japanese hot spot. They are an Izakaya, apparently, though I didn't see a crazy cocktail list which I've come to expect in Toronto Izakayas. This likely isn't traditional, but who doesn't love the option of a Sake bomb? 

I dislike how they don't have bento boxes or lunch and dinner specials. Putting together your own meal tends to add up quickly, and requires far too many choices for my liking. What is this... Starbucks? 

I had the California roll, edamame, ebi sashimi and green salad. All were fresh and exactly what you'd expect. 

Fun Fact: Ebi means shrimp in Japanese. I am very short and I grew up with a Japanese sister. She calls me Ebi and I always thought she was mispronouncing Evie. Nope. She was calling me small."}
