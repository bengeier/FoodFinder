{"text":"Good authentic Bangladeshi cuisine.  Going there for quiet some time, food has always been excellent and consistent."}
{"text":"This restaurant is known for its kacchi biriyani, and it is living up to its expectations. We had a delicious mouth-watering kacchi biriyani here and had another one to go. It comes with oil-free spiced and moistened rice, an egg, a potato and a generous portion of tendered meat. They blended together very well to make one great meal! It is available only on Fridays and Sundays. I definitely recommend this place for biriyanis."}
{"text":"I only tried their Kacchi Biriani, it was as  good as I ever had. A must try place for Kacchi lovers."}
{"text":"I would say the best Bangladeshi food in Canada. Foods are like from home. Best kacchi in town. My favorite is the chicken biriyani though. We tried the chaap and luchi, was really very good. But the amount wasn't sufficient though. However, a very good place for deshi food and they should improve their service a bit. That's what I personally feel."}
{"text":"Was in the area on Weds night and read great things about this place, mostly from the other Yelp reviews. I was surely disappointed. While the taste of the food is satisfactory, the portion sizes and service were not. Restaurant was empty when we walked in around 7:00PM. There were some people watching TV and did not greet/seat us for a few minutes until we asked if they were working there. That's when they figured we were actually dining there. Instead of patiently going through their \"specials\" with us, they decided to make our lives easier by volun-telling us to order a chicken and beef dish since it was our first time. I inquired about the curry fish but the owner was so adamant about the beef that I just went with it (at this point I just wanted to get it over with). When the food came, portion sizes were SMALL. Lots of rice, no veges, couple pieces of meat, contrary to the previous reviews about \"generous size\" portions. My dish wasn't worth the $9.99. If this was a proper \"special\", it should have been $4.99 at best. My partner's dish was easier to swallow at $6.00, but again her chicken biryani was small as heck. I came in here expecting to be satisfied, at least portion-wise, even if the food sucked, but I came out still half-hungry, not satisfied, and looking for the closest McDonalds. I usually get this feeling when I go to a high-end sushi bar or European restaurant, but in this case we're talking about a low-end, seemingly inexpensive Indian hole in the wall. Sigh."}
{"text":"Nasty nasty nasty  Found a bug in mine. When i asked. They refused and brought back the same plate without the bug. I refused to pay but they threatened to call the cops.  Avoid this place"}
{"text":"I'm neither Bangladeshi nor Bengali and I love the fish curry at this place as it is almost like my mom's cooking (we're from the south west coast of India). My husband also enjoys all the meat preparations. We're so glad to see others enjoy it too!"}
{"text":"We ordered 5 dishes, all biriyanis, and somehow the server thought it was appropriate to bring one plate, then wait 2 min. before bringing the next, then wait for another 2 min., and then on to the next plate... Who serves like that? Have they never been to a restaurant before? The food was really, really greasy and it's like they didn't even try with the vegetables we ordered. Zero stars for service and ambiance, 1 star for portion of food, but 0 stars for bad-tasting food. It cost us almost $60 and the whole family was shocked that the food was more than $30."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I went to this little gem of a place for lunch today, based on the other Yelp reviews.  This place is not fancy at first glance but the food?  Spectacular!  I HAD to add my voice to the praise being poured out here!  My colleagues and I all enjoyed large flavourful portions, with service provide with great fervour by the owner.   The bill?  Less then $9!!  I have no complaints and I will be back again....and again.  I will be suggesting to my colleagues this be our new \"regular\" spot.  What a find."}
{"text":"A for Anando. We enter, order, and the mummyji behind the counter scurries into the kitchen. Over a few different visits, the dishes that have emerged from that kitchen have been Bangla homestyle classics - delicious without fail. Kacchi biryani - soft delicious beef and fragrant biryani rice loll in their dish, complimenting each other in ridiculously over-the-top ways. Rui fish curry is made pretty much the way my mum would have made it - if she had been Bengali (she wasn't). Perhaps my best meal there other than the kachi biryani was this incredibly savoury fall-apart-on-touch t-bone steak covered in a thick curry sauce. More to come in this review later including a mention of duck and mishti dhoi (no, not in the same dish) - review temporarily suspended as kachi biryani cravings necessitated an immediate visit."}
{"text":"Price point and quality of food and service is superb. Both the uncle and aunty  were awesome and caring. The aunty there who runs the front cash and the kitchen is a powerhouse! It's the best rated bengali/indian restaurant in Little Bangladesh neighborhood."}
{"text":"An amazing Bengali restaurant right on the Danforth. I have been there for lunches and dinners. I have had the fish combo, mutton biriyani, the beef Kachhi biriyani and it has all had the same taste of a home cooked meal. Amazing tasty and makes me stuff myself :) The place is big spacious and clean which is important if you are planning to visit with a bunch of friends or have a baby in a stroller. Did I mention the in house made mishti doi (sweet yogurt) and the amazing rasomalai. There are a couple of other Bengali restaurants nearby but this has become my favorite over the others."}
{"text":"I was looking for authentic Bangladeshi food in Toronto for a long time and finally I found it here. I was there with my wife and another couple.   Trust me if you are looking for the taste of kacchi biriyani from dhaka,this is the place. They prepare it with beef. The meat is tender and easily comes apart and rice is fragrant and cooked to perfection. It is served only on Friday through Sunday. Please call them before you go as the biriyani gets sold out often. I was so full after a plate of biriyani that I was not able to try any other dishes there, which I would like to do.  They have been around for 5 years, I was amazed that I never heard about them. The owners work there. The husband works at the front and the wife is the mastermind behind all the recipes. They have the passion for food and loves it when people enjoy it to the fullest."}
{"text":"Amazing freshly prepared Bangladeshi cuisine. Family-owned, quaint restaurant with warm, inviting service. Recommended if you're looking for an authentic experience."}
{"text":"Anando serves the best Kacchi Biriyani (rice and meat - beef, cooked together) I have ever tried in the city. Try this with Borhani (a kind of salty and spicy yoghurt drink - good for digestion).   They serve Kacchi Biriyani only on Friday and Sunday, unless there is any special order. On other days you can try Bhuna Khichuri (rice and lentil cooked together) - my second favorite dish with Beef or Duck curry; or Goat or Chicken Biriyani or Beef Tehari (rice cooked with small pieces of meat). For breakfast or as a light snack try Dhal Puri, or Parata with Bhaji (Vegetables) or Paya (made from trotters or hoof of a cow). All are very delicious. Try Ras Malai or Rice Pudding as a desert. Both are very sweet and yummy! Their Mango Lassi is also my favorite.  It's a family run restaurant. The ambience is very casual, don't expect anything fancy. Price is awesome (for the quantity and quality of the food)! The owner is very chatty and friendly, ask for suggestions. Though Yelp put them in the Indian, Bangladeshi categories, their cooking style is more Bangladeshi (very authentic) than Indian.   Have fun!  **************************************************  UPDATE June 24, 2017 --------------------------- Anondo has been closed. The owner sold the restaurant to one of his relatives who opened it with a new name \"Red n Green\" just a month ago. Food, service and price are as good as Anondo. \"Kachchi Biriyani\" is still equally delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and very friendly, genuine owners. The food tasted very moist, tender, and flavourful, and the waiter had great recommendations for our different personalities. I love extreme heat, my mother tends to dislike Indian food, and my girlfriend is a vegetarian. The recommendations delivered. I will definitely return. You will too. Wonderful."}
{"text":"This small, nondescript Bengali restaurant on the far end of Danforth is a total find. Absolutely amazing food, friendly patrons and and staff, and low prices.  Upon striking up a conversation with some other customers we learned this is one of the few places in the city to get true home cooked Bengali food. The mother of the family that runs the place apparently cooks the food just like she does for her family. And, after tasting the food, I believe it.  We didn't bother with the menu. Instead we just asked the young daughter of the owners to give us a sampling of their dishes, mostly the non meat ones. We ended up with an absolute feast.  To start we had lentil pakoras, a fried bread stuffed with lentils called dalpuri, and a chickpea-like dish with onions and potatoes called bwot. For mains we had a tasty spicy lentil soup, a vegetarian curry, and kacchi (beef) biryani, all served with delicious, fresh pratha.  Everything was good, but the kacchi was mindblowing. The rice in this dish had the most amazing subtle spicing. Not sure what was in there exactly but damn it was awesome. And extremely fresh. Only available on Friday though.  We finished with tea and a variety of desserts including a lovely pudding with caramel. I'm not huge on South Asian desserts but these were pretty good.  All this was easily enough to feed the four people in our group and we were shocked when the bill came in under $30. An unbelievable deal for this quality of food.  Recommended order: dalpuri, pratha, and kacchi biryani.  This place is the real deal! Go here now."}
{"text":"Delicious & Authentic Bangladeshi cuisine. Good service & ambiance. The owners are very welcoming and helpful to customer's who may not be familiar with the cuisine. This is my second visit with friends, & I'm obsessed with their \"kachii biriyani\". They serve this famous rice & lamb dish in limited quantities. Only on Fridays & Sundays. Make sure to call ahead to order & reserve this biriyani. They have other dishes like beef biriyani & Shaami Kebabs (lentils & meat mixture fritters) A visit to Anondo is an experince just for the Kachii biriyani. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great Kachhi Biriyani with authentic Bangladeshi flavours. The proportion of rice and meat are however disappointing. Too much rice with not that much of meat. The mutton biriani is also good but has the same problem ."}
{"text":"was on the hunt for authentic bengali food since my parents were visiting me, and went here because we really wanted Kacchi Biryani. It was amazing! True Bangladeshi food, big portions, and low prices. Will be back again :)"}
