{"text":"Generally when I go to a Chinese take-out restaurant, I know that I am usually in for a greasy, fried food affair - not the healthiest choice. However, to my delight Wokin Express has really fresh and healthy choices. I have been here a couple of times now and every time I have ordered something different and am pleased with everything. All there chicken dishes are 100% white meat and NO MSG!! The ingredients taste fresh and all there stir fried dishes are light and not drenched in grease. Some of my favourite dishes are 
General Tao Chicken - 100% white meat, thin crispy batter and nice sweet and spicy sauce
Lemon Chicken - They give you a whole chicken breast fillet with yummy lemon sauce on the side
and PAD THAI is simply AMAZING!! best I've had in the Toronto area. The noodles are cooked to perfection and the sauce is not too sweet and definitely not made from Ketchup. 
Brown Rice option as well!! 

Altogether, Wokin Express is definitely a go to place for us whenever we want yummy healthy Chinese food."}
{"text":"Excellent delivery, service and food, and the owners are friendly and professional. Ingredients always really fresh (high quality meat too) and the food tastes fantastic - our favourites include the General Tso chicken wings and the ginger beef. So happy to have such a fantastic place locally!"}
{"text":"Best  take out Chinese food ! We ordered the party menu and it was a great hit - even for the picky eaters - we've lived in  Markham and Stouffville definitely didn't have take out Chinese food like this"}
{"text":"We ordered the 6B combo meal, which was average at best. The ginger beef was tough and gristly and the ribs were not great. Will not go back ."}
{"text":"A little too far north for me but worth the drive. Food is good, portions are big, owner is courteous."}
{"text":"Yum!!!
The owners are super sweet and the food is great!  Fresh and tasty takeout.
Mango salad, General Tso chicken and spicy green curry are some of our favorites.
Delivery and takeout are both fast.
We've been here a ton of times and we will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"I have never written a review of anything before.  I have been a long time yelp user but never felt compelled to write something.  I just had the best thai/chinese food ive ever had in my life.  I had sweet and spicy chicken, chili chicke, half order sweet and sour chicken balls and chicken fried rice.  ALL of it was the best of each ive ever had..seemingly fresh ingrediants, all white meat chicken breast for everything..just absolutely fantastic.  i never listen to 1 review people but i promise you this is worth it if your close enough to consider it"}
{"text":"Wok In Express...
Hands down the Best Chinese Food in Brooklin!

Fresh everything and the owners are super friendly and excited to help suggest food from the menu!
We have tried quite a few dish's from the menu and so far nothing has been a let down, they offer a wide selection of Thai food too!

Yummy Asian goodness here folks!\"}
{"text":"My first review for yelp. This restaurant has horrible customer service. Food is Good tho! Unfortunately they made a mistake on my order (I told them a rice dish) and  gave me a bunch of veggies instead? Told me it was my fault for not understanding them and repeatedly hung up on me."}
{"text":"You know you have an addiction, when you start having cravings for Wokin Express as dinner time approaches.  I think it was all started by their fresh, quality ingredients and the flavours.  Those tasty flavours.  

I have tried a number of things on the menu and have never been disappointed.  The dumplings stand out and are a must have.  Add them to every order, you will not be disappointed.

If you haven't tried Wokin Express.  You should."}
{"text":"This restaurant has horrible customer service and the food is average however they have zero flexibility on exchanging items within a combo and they give the impression that they don't really need your business. On occasion they will close early and will not answer their phones up to half an hour before they close.  Frustrating because I only live four minutes away and can get there before closing"}
{"text":"I enjoy the Wok In and I order frequently both for pickup and delivery. Overall, it is a good business that makes good food and has a fair selection of choices. The place is clean, the staff is somewhat friendly, and the delivery is always timely. Occasionally, the quality of the food varies. 

The people at the Wok In Express are hardworking and know how to make good Chinese food. Generally, I'll eat here once every week, or every two weeks. The General Tsao chicken, the chicken balls, and the egg/spring rolls are always on point. The chicken fried rice and the beef and broccoli are not always consistent and vary between \"extremely good\" and \"not very good at all\". While I am perfectly content with this, because people are not robots and do not make their food exactly the same way every single time, it can be very off putting on the days where the food isn't so good. Perhaps this is caused by a rotation of staff members wherein some are more talented than others? It is difficult to know for sure, because I never eat my food there. 

As far as delivery options go, it can be a tad pricey. But nonetheless I think that the Wok In Express is worth trying if you haven't already. Delivery is always on time and the chicken is always good!"}
