{"text":"2015 update: they're closed and now the next budget Mexican food had moved into the old converted pawn shop. The new place is called \"The Steamed Tamale \" which I haven't tried yet but several of my coworkers have and no one has bothered to say to me 'oh it's SOOOO good, you have to try it!' So I'm guessing it's probably another cheapo Mexican place not worth your time. As the previous owners found out,  you gotta sell flavorful food at a better price or you aren't going to be able to compete in downtown.  So, I guess in a way it is about big parking lots, ambiance,  and decorations isn't it? Because if the best you can do is charge restaurant prices for pawn shop food, then you probably ain't gonna make it, right? Right."}
{"text":"Fellow Yelper & co-worker Nadia C convinced me to give Aya & Peilas a try, and I'm glad I did.  I can now add it to my list of good Mexican food joints near where I work, bringing the total to five.  I've tried both the green & red chile burros, and both were great!  The sauce is very robust and just spicy enough for me (for some probably not spicy enough).  They've got a lot of other offers too, along with lunch specials, and even gringo food.   It is a pretty small place, but you can takeout and the wait is very minimal.    All in all, another great Mexican restaurant find for those who work near the Capitol or are okay with traveling a bit West on Van Buren."}
{"text":"Standing in the suicide lane I contemplated if it was worth risking my life to walk to this place for lunch.  The menu here is a bit more eclectic than the average betero's. It has burgers, fish n' chips and even hot dogs on the menu.  I went with a more original item, a cactus burrito. the staff was nice enough to let me know that the usual red sauce had meat init and they left that out. I ordered some chips with my meal too.  It was the best cactus burrito I ever had, and the only, it is supposedly healthy and not too bad. (4.25) The chips were wonderful  but a bit pricey at $1.25.  Drinks are limited to cans and bottles so getting you food to go and getting a drink at the adjacent circle K is recommended.  There were a few homeless people enjoying a High gravity malt liquor' out on the patio, but that just comes with the territory don't let that scare you away."}
{"text":"Aya & Peilas is new in the sense that they have re-opened since 1988.  It is on the corner of 17th Ave and Van Buren, just west of the the Circle K.  A stack of menus were hand delivered by the family who owns Aya & Peilas to my office building just down the street and we went and tried it out.  We did take out, but they do phone orders and dine in.  There are about 2 booths and 2 tables in there, it's small and warm but very clean.  There were state employees inside ordering lunch to go just like we were.  A & P has some good deals on the lunch combos.  They are only $4.95.  I got the taco, enchilada and tostada.  Not bad, pretty good and for less than $5, can't beat it!  It is a glorified 'ertos type restaurant.  The family owners and employees seem very nice.    Other workies got some lunch too and they were happy with it.  It's nice to have a new spot to grab some grub while at work!  Oh and they have navajo tacos and Indian fry bread on the menu---- YUMMMM!"}
