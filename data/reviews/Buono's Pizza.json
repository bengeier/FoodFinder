{"text":"I created a Yelp account almost a year ago and have never been inspired to write a review.... until now. Phoenix can be a tough place for a pizza lover from New York. It seems there are generally two choices in this town: pies so dry and bland they can't really be considered pizzas, or pies so overblown and expensive they can't really be considered pizzas (Berkeley Soy Cheese Veggie anyone?).

In a last-ditch effort to find pizza love here in the valley we decided to try out Buono's based on a friend's recommendation. Upon opening the door my girlfriend (also a New Yorker) immediately said, \"This just smells right\". And right it was. Everything about the place took me back to high school, hanging out with my friends in the local pizza shop after class. The aromas, the decorations, the beat up arcade games in the corner... everything just felt authentic. Not at all like the manufactured NY some restaurants try to pawn off  for $20 per pie. It was just a small, relaxed space full of loud & happy families.

We were content enough just to sit & revel in the environment while we waited for our order, but once we saw our pizza we were overjoyed. There, floating on top of the cheese was what we'd been missing all these years - pools of orange pizza grease. A sure sign we'd finally found the drippy cheese, floppy crust, and spicy pepperoni experience we'd been looking for.

In short, the food did not disappoint, the service was good, and the vibe in the restaurant was cool. It's the best New York style pizza we've found in the valley, and we'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon and decided to try a new pizza place. A hole in the wall type of place in a strip mall. Nothing exciting in the decor; several large screen TVs on the walls and lots of \"New York\" pictures.  Clean.   Ordered the White Pizza, cheese sticks, 2 side salads,  buttered penne and a cannoli.  The pizza was pretty darn good. A very buttery, garlicky cheesy bread. Decent side salad.  My toddler loved her penne. The cheese sticks were obviously a frozen product so I won't be ordering them again. I have never had cannoli so I am not sure if it was a proper example or not.... though it did seem to be frozen also. We will go back for more pizza and salad. Total was just under $50. (no drinks)"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now, and both times the food has been really good. It takes a while for the food to come out, but it's actually made fresh, so it's worth the wait. The service is lousy, but that's the only bad thing I have to say."}
{"text":"My new favorite to get a slice and a cold one! The service is great, decor is my home away from home. It's a New Yorkers pizza spot! Great pie!"}
{"text":"This place is super awesome. .I love their pizza and stuffed shells..staff is super friendly and I go every chance I get..I recommend this place to any and all true pizza loves."}
{"text":"We knew when we walked in that we were going to love this place!  We had an amazing pizza, perfectly cooked, and delicious!  Yes, we did have to wait a little bit, but there was a line at the counter that just wouldn't stop (doesn't that tell you something).  The second time we came back, the lady behind the counter remembered us, and where we sat, and how busy it was at the time, and even apologized to us.  This time, we ordered to go, one veal, and one eggplant parmesan....each portion was two meals!  Fantastic!  So, tonight, it is time for a birthday celebration, and we are going back for the 3rd time in little over a month! We can't wait :)"}
{"text":"Wow what a disappointment. Used to cone here all the time and it was great. Been going to Nicantonis and Venezias mostly lately. Was in the neighborhood and felt like giving old Buonos a go.

Horrible girl behind the counter could not have been less friendly. Mexican guy wearing an Italia shirt refused to say hello.

Slices are now quite tiny and far from as flavorful as they used to be. The crust is still some of the best in town but unfortunately everything else fails.

Oh well I guess."}
{"text":"If this is what NY style pizza is, I want no part of it. It was soo greasy and a bit salty. The crust was chewy, not in a good way. The sauce wasn't really all that great either. We also had a sausage roll. It's basically a calzone with a small portion of unsliced sausage stuffed with too much onion and peppers. We weren't impressed with the mozzarella sticks either. Service was not very friendly. Place looks like it needs some tlc. And yes, the place is smoky. We wreaked of it when we got home. Our shirts, including my 1yr old, smelled like old cooking oil. Gosh, I can't think of anything nice to say."}
{"text":"The best pizza ever.  This would the last pizza I eat before I die.  I was raised on their pizza and when I moved out of state, nothing could replace it.  Whenever I go back to AZ, I always have to do two things: see my mother and eat at Buono's.  Yeah."}
{"text":"Oh dear me, how the mighy have fallen!

A year ago I would've proudly given this place 5 stars but the last 6 or 7 times I've been here it just hasn't been as good. I don't know if its the different people doing the cooking or what but the standards seem to have slipped. Back a couple years ago when I started going there a beefy guy was doing the cooking, always made quality pizza. Now? Not so much! The semi-surly lady from Jersey (sorry Tom T., she's from Jersey) is still there on occassion though. Bring back the beefy guy who can cook please!!

I still love the chicken parm despite the downslope on the pizza, it's a massive sandwich and definitely makes me happy...

All in all I will keep going back hoping that the pizza will get back to where it once was..."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in 20 Years Saw A Groupon And Figured I'd Try It Again. .. good was not bad I've had better but it's not disgusting.  When I went to pay with my Groupon they wouldn't accept it.  The man who claimed to be the owner (he wasn't) did absolutely nothing to help me. Very rude and almost seemed as if he Didn't Speak English.  NEVER GOING BACK"}
{"text":"Few things make me sadder than making this review:

I have been going to Buono's for over a decade now and it never failed to impress... 
When I was told there were new owners I was told the recipe's and cooks were all the same so I was optimistic (especially considering that it has been good since I was 16 years old and started going there *29 now*)

I have given them 3 chances now and each time it has gotten ruder and the food has gotten worse with every visit. 

If by any chance the owners/ coming managers read this page: Here are a few things that could have circumvented losing another loyal customer.

Specifically to the owner: 

If a customer shows you that they are being over-charged do NOT make the excuse that the \"school kids\" are changing the prices on the outside chalk board... After that, if they point out that the same price is on the menu above the register in green ink... do NOT double down that the school kids changed that price too!!!

To anybody in charge of the food:

1. The garlic knots were a welcome addition when they were first added to the menu and started out delicious but it is very clear that the dough for them is made far in advance and frozen which leaves them very stale and tasteless.

2. If a pizza is black on the bottom it should not be served.


As much as I have been frustrated I do hope they turn it around but I do not expect to be back again. I will really miss Buono's but I ate there so often that I am sure to lose a few pounds in the process."}
{"text":"Wow!  I am so unhappy about Buono's. We came here several times a month for the past 15 years (we live quite far away) and loved the pizza and sandwiches. It was not fancy, but the pizza was excellent and true  New York style. Nowhere else in the valley could I get pizza the way I knew that it should be made.

I read that Buono's was sold recently and visited twice before reading about the sale. The restaurant had been spruced up, the staff was different and the food terrible. We had a disgusting Chicken Parmigiana hero. Awful. The next visit we decided to stick to the plain cheese pizza. I had previously said that if I could have one last meal before going on the electric chair it would be Buono's Pizza. I would now rather throw this pizza onto the electric chair! It is AWFUL!!! Thick bready crust covered in too much cheap cheese with terrible sauce. We didn't even finish our slices. The tasteless garlic knots were brought out still frozen in the middle. Yuck!  I will never go back again. So terrible. If anyone knows Jimmy and finds out if he reopens somewhere, please post here. Stay away!!! If I could give no stars, I would, but just because it was epic and is now so mediocre."}
{"text":"The pizza: better than average. It's pretty damn good really. The rest of the menu is \"meh\". They certainly have no clue how to time other food with pizza. If you order anything else with you pizza it'll probably be cold by the time the pizza is ready. Of you stick with the pizza alone you'll be alright. 

The service: If the pizza was bad nobody would ever return. Sadly that's gotta be the only thread holding this business together. I torture myself maybe three time a year and the running joke when we decide to eat there is \"I wonder if we will get the same shitty service?\" Well, they are consistent. It's almost like they made it part of their business model to treat people rudely. And particularly, some short old woman is usually the biggest offender. She's gotta be an owner or family because she's been there forever. I own a business myself and if one of my employees represented my company this way, you can bet your ass they would be fired. Family included! But I gotta say I'm not angry about it, just puzzled. Like I said before, it's so awkward and happens EVERY time we eat there, we just giggle about how ridiculous it is. I love to watch a good train wreck and the service here is without a doubt a train wreck."}
{"text":"I have been going to Buono's for over 20 years and have always been treated very well by the owners of this charming neighborhood Pizza restaurant.  The owners use a hands on approach to their business which I truly believe has allowed it to remain successful over the many years.  There are only a scant few business in that bleak area that have survived.  
It sure does not hurt that there New York style pizza is fantastic and there prices are very affordable.  The lunch special is a mere $5 for two 1 topping slices and a beverage.  Can't beat that.  Upon ordering you can peruse the bounty of Manhattan memorabilia that adorns the walls.  I am not from NYC, but I am a huge fan of the people, the neighborhoods and especially the food.
the atmosphere is very casual and family friendly.  There are a few arcade games in the back and a large screen TV to watch News or sports.  They never seem to be playing \"The Golden Girls\", but I will still come back as often as possible for the delicious pies and nice, quick sevice."}
{"text":"The provolone, pastrami on rye was excellent! Just need a pickle on the side and I'm set. Great family local spot. The gentleman at the counter was really helpful and service was great."}
{"text":"Pizza is okay. The cranky woman usually behind the counter who answers the phone and takes orders is rude and unpleasant - if not for her, might add a star."}
{"text":"After getting many suggestions of a pizza place to try, I finally decided on this place. I called to place my order and asked about any specials. I was told about a special which included chicken wings and garlic knots. Great!! I said let's do it, ordered it, and ordered another large pizza. Go to pick everything up, and no chicken wings or garlic knots. I asked about them and the man said he didn't have them down. Ok.. I did order them. He said he was the one that took my order and did not get that.  To which I replied. . You're the one that told me about the special. To which he looked at me like I were stupid. Did nothing to remedy it, not even offering to allow me to pay for them now if I wanted them. Very annoyed and will not ever go there again, now will I recommend it to anyone. Lousy service with incompetent employees."}
{"text":"I used to love Buono's(25 years worth) , it was like the pizza we had in Brooklyn, but my last few experiences with them with self pick up and  via DoorDash  were totally disappointing. Initially it was the occasional poorer quality of the pizza, today I ordered via doordash, was told it would arrive at 858, I get a call at 905 and the door dash driver calls and tells me the store is closed, WHAT Really, we were hungry, couldn't Bounos tell me when I first ordered that they couldn't accept the order???  That is not the way to keeps customers, shame on you!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for 13 years, and have made it a point to continue the tradition of Friday Buono's nights. People who say that the new management ruined this place are perceiving something that isn't true, as they are going in with the mindset that it WILL be worse. Lemme tell you, it isn't worse. It's the same. And luckily, the same just so happens to be phenomenal. The service is fast and friendly (don't expect to be treated like royalty though), the food is greasy and wonderful (if you don't like grease, dab it with a napkin), and the restaurant is clean (an improvement from when Jimmy owned the place). Plus, it isn't overpriced like most delicious pizza joints, and that's coming from a broke college student!

TL;DR If you're in town from out of state, or you live just down the street, and are looking for a good slice or pie, Buono's is, and always has been, the place to go."}
{"text":"-----RATINGS by Theo-------
Food - 9 - A bit greasy, but a real  treat!
Service - 5 - Ran by every once in a while. When he was giving us out plates he literally ran by and tossed the plates on our table. No silverware, I guess.
Management - ?
Looks - 6 - Not really a Pizza Parlor...
Other Comments - There was no prizes in the games they had there.. Geez.
:-:-:  TOTAL RATING  :-:-:
:-:-:       22 / 50         :-:-:"}
{"text":"Unlike the other reviews here, the service was nice I thought. I was greeted nicely and served nicely - the pizza was great but the fries were.... Unexceptional. I got the pepperoni pizza fries and I was expecting some fantastic carne Asada fries like deal from filibertos. Nope. Just some fries with marinara sauce thrown on top of it. I was really disappointed. The pizza was great though but it's a bit pricey."}
{"text":"If you can't make it to a pizza dive in NY, go to Buono's.  The pizza is probably 4 stars -- and the service (did I just get yelled at for not ordering correctly?) comes in well below that -- but it gets 5 stars for being 100% authentic."}
{"text":"I was born in the valley and I was introduced to Buonos about 15 years ago.  It is the best new york style pizza in the valley!  They have since changed owners and I really like the new beer selection and menu.  I also recommend the meatball sub."}
{"text":"I bet my husband is going to make me fold my pizza. Yep, he did. This was really good pizza, NY/NJ type pizza. Thin big foldable slices. Nice people helped us at our table even though they just have counter service. (we were clueless) They have beer and the atmosphere is very casual, NY memorabilia, TV's. In a strip mall by Goodwill in Mesa. Great for kids after their Saturday games! If we ever find ourselves out there again we will definitely grab a slice!"}
{"text":"Amazing New York style pizza. Being from the East Coast I'm a major critic of pizza in the valley. I have literally only found a couple of places I like (Grimaldis & Red Devil) but Buonos is very good as well. I do order well done to make sure it's cooked enough, but it's been perfect every time!"}
{"text":"Horrible place pizza served burnt pizza with burnt meat .  Salad old and served with slim on it. When taken to counter to return worker threw food all pisssed off into thrash and went into back. Stating he is really busy right now. 
Customers are the reason you are busy.
Apparently they forgot this.
 Avoid this place salad will definitely give you food poisoning."}
{"text":"A good place to get an affordable, Authentic New York style pizza.  Our server (a new girl the last time i went in) was attentive, and polite to both me and my grandfather whom is an italian from New Jersey and has gone there for 20 something years.  The atmosphere is sort of low brow (there is a big screen tv right in he middle of the room, and a jukebox that plays a bit loudly) , but the pizza is delicious. The sauce and cheese were both major factors in the pizza being so authentic to the NY style.  For the food, and price points I give Buono's four stars, and it will continue to be a family favorite."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best pizza places I've found in the valley. It's in a run-down strip mall and looks a little scary, but it's fantastic. (And next door to a great Mexican restaurant Rositas.)  The pizza is delicious, the salads are pretty good and the subs are tasty.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have been going to Buono's for over 20 years and the pizza is just as good as it ever was. Still consider it to be true NY pizza. It's not fancy but the pizza is #1"}
{"text":"Buono you have a special place in my heart... 
This little pizza joint is an a tired looking strip mall. They have been at this location for 20+ years, that says something right there. 
We sat at a booth and ordered some beers. They were served ice cold in super frosty large mugs. 
We placed our pizza order and watched some football, sipping on our drinks. The guy who was waiting on us (the owner I presume) was great and brought us some complementary cheese sticks. It was a very nice gesture and they were good. 
Our pizza took awhile, but when it arrived...Oh My! 
We had the thin crust with pepperoni, mushroom, sausage, broccoli and onion. (see pic)
The sausage was the best topping. It is the super thin slices, none of those nasty little balls. 
If you have not had broccoli on pizza, try it. It is my new addition. 
Everything worked perfectly together. 
This place is my type pf hang out. It is family owned, cozy, has cold beer and great food. 
I better start hitting the gym twice as hard cuz this place is going to be dangerous..."}
{"text":"Probably the closest you will get to a NYC slice. Have tried several that claim to be NY pizzerias in the valley and none compare to Buonos. Best pizza in town!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for the 2 slice / 1 topping with drink combo. Pepperoni slices were fresh out of the oven. I love the traditional NY style pizza. The slices were good size and perfect for folding in half. Still one of our favorite pizza places when we are in the area."}
{"text":"You got to be either absolutely crazy or a young kid to give this place 5 stars.  Who are you kidding?

I have been here two times and that's gonna be it.  I went and ordered a sandwich the other day.  With only 2 other people in the restaurant, you would think that service would be prompt.  I was waiting and waiting for my sandwich when I noticed the cashier looking at me funny.  

Amazingly, she thinks I can't hear her as she starts talking to the guy who makes the food and they FORGOT to make my sandwich.  Again, there are only two other people and OF COURSE, the guy who orders after me gets his food before me.

I look at both of them and ask \"Is there a problem?\"  Now, they both ignore me.

Upon receiving my sandwich to go, I received a half hearted apology for the wait.  Once I got home, I discovered that the bread was burnt and the rest of the sandwich was forgettable.

Did I mention the sandwich was completely overpriced as well?

This is sad excuse for a restaurant.  Really."}
{"text":"My son and I went there just last week.  We ordered the 20\" pizza with pepperoni and cheese.  It was one of the best pizza we've had there.  Yes, pizza is greasy, that's how they eat it in NY.  If the oil doesn't run down your are it isn't NY pizza. I am sorry you all had bad experiences, especially those who had been long time customers.  I will try it again and see how we are treated.  I did find that if you go up to the counter and order your meal speeds thing up a litte. I hate chains and the only other good pizza place. If you don't say something to them while you are there eating they won't know you had a problem.  Writing a bad review means nothing if they don't see what was wrong."}
{"text":"Anytime I can find a $10 for $20 Groupon (which, thankfully, is frequently!) you'll see me here with the family. 

The pizza doesn't appear to be anything special by appearance, but wow, it's absolutely deeee-lish!  My wife really enjoys their wings as well. Great flavor and texture. The reason I'm giving a 4 star review is because it isn't mind-blowingly fantastic, but it is definitely a yummy pizza pie.

And we haven't ever had a negative experience with the staff. They haven't been overly friendly or bubbly, but they've been very nice.

And an extra bonus for me is the big screen TV always tuned to whatever big game is currently on."}
{"text":"I think this is some of the best pizza in town. I haven't tried anything else on the menu because I can't get by the pizza. So good. Even cold the next morning.
I haven't been here in awhile because they changed their special but I was craving it so I called up and ordered an extra large cheese. The only real pizza is cheese pizza, in my opinion.
The staff has always been friendly to me. Even forgiving change when I didn't have it. Even last night someone else was picking up their order and the total was $X and 52 cents and he didn't have the 52 cents and they said don't worry about it. Not a big deal but a nice small thing not many places do. I had been in there enough that when they changed their special awhile ago they gave me the old one one more time. Again not a big deal but still cool.
Definitely a family owned restaurant. Small and covered in New York decorum all over the walls. A friend at work introduced me to the place and we used to get pizza all the time at lunch. I will still go back when I get a craving but just not as often as I did and only because they changed their special and work is just a little farther way now.
Still really good pizza though. Some of the best."}
{"text":"This was the first pizza I had here in AZ when I moved here from Long Island 20 years ago. This place was part of our family for a long time, heck my ex wife even worked there. Jimmy and Connie were like family. But now it has changed owners and the quality has left with Jimmy and the rest of the staff. It was sad when I went there and the guy behind the counter told me nothing has changed we are still the best. I knew then I was going to be disappointed and boy I sure was. STAY AWAY PEOPLE while it may look and smell like NY pizza it aint!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The reason my husband and I decided to order their pizza was T-Mobile offered a drastic discount on Groupon.  We used that Groupon to try out their pizza.  Two words:  big mistake.

It's important to note that I can eat pretty much anything and find something good to say about it, but the pizza from this place was, hands down, the worst I have ever had.  Here are some notable reasons why:

*Very light layer of cheese--I felt like I was eating bread
*Flavorless tomato sauce or whatever the tomfoolery they put on the pizza
*Extremely greasy--I actually took a slice and squeezed it and watched grease pour out

Pizza Hut, Domino's, Little Caesar, hell, even Fry's store-brand pizza all put this restaurant's food to shame.

We also ordered their fried mushrooms and zucchini.  Again, bland, old-tasting, really greasy, and downright terrible.

I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I wish that zero stars was an option to make up for the reviewers giving this place 4 or 5 that are obviously relatives or employees paid in this slop. First, when you walk in the (disgusting, unwashed) front door, the place reeks of smoke and filth. We literally had to roll down the car windows on the way home because our clothes were permeated with the stench. Secondly, we made the mistake of ordering the calamari to start, which was obviously old, freezer burned and exceedingly inedible. So, we sent it back and they replaced it with another appetizer that was almost as bad. Then, the large Big Guido pizza we ordered arrived shortly afterward, featuring big chunks of mystery meat swimming in a pool of grease. If \"New York style\" means frozen ingredients and tasteless sauce from a can packaged several years ago in a questionable part of Jersey, then this is your place. Highly suggest that ownership calls Robert Irvine at Restaurant Impossible. Until then, AVOID."}
{"text":"Had a meatball pizza here Friday night, it was awesome! I have eaten here on and off for a couple years, it has always been good. I always get to go here and have never had any problems so i will continue to order from here  when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Buono's used to be GREAT.  Being from the east coast, it was hard to find pizza that tasted the same.  We found Buono's and all was right with the world.
THEN IT WAS SOLD....
The portions have gotten smaller, the quality has gone downhill, and the prices have gone up.
After the last time when the large calzone was the size of a hot pocket, we will not be going back
We are now on the hunt for a new place to satisfy our pizza craving.
So far La Famiglia, which is across the street was pretty decent"}
{"text":"Its a Thursday evening about 6:30 PM and I was craving pizza after a really long day at work. I was hungry since I did not eat since 11 AM, so I did not want just any pizza but the \"good\" kind of pizza. Now Buonos has been here since before I moved close to it. By father loved this place. We enjoyed it at least once a month. Unfortunately it changed hands and everything has been declining since. We returned after the last two times of burnt pizza, missed toppings and cold pasta. It was still worth going. But no more. They are dead to me. Sob. I am so bummed.

First thing that really bothered me this time is the lack of a web site. I really had to dig around the web to find the menu. The bookmarked site I had did not work any more. The site was taken down. Not cool. 

I call to order a small extra cheese pizza for me and my husband wanted the spaghetti and meatballs. He used to order pizza until the last few times he asked for a pepperoni and ham and got a burned pepperoni pizza with raw ham sprinkled sparingly on top AFTER it came out of the oven. Who does that? Bake the ham with the pizza, not after. How hard is that? This happened two consecutive times! Anyway, back to my last experience. So they were very nice over the phone and they say 25 minutes it will be ready. Great! 

Twenty five minutes passed and my husband goes and gets the order. I am waiting super hungry and very eagerly at home. Then after a few minutes I get a call from my husband. He informed me that they have NOTHING. No pizza, no pasta, NOTHING. Wait, WHAT? I did call in 25 minutes ago, didn't I? I heard the gal say, \"well I and of remember you calling, but the order just did not go in.\" WTF?!!!!!!!! 

I am sorry, most COMPETENT food service places takes and order and then makes it so they can sell it to the customer who ordered it and then they make money. Who takes an order to \"forget\" to make it?!! My husband was the only one there. They were not suer-busy and we did NOT get lost in a rush frenzy of orders, thats for sure. 

Then the girl tells my husband that they can start it, and it would be another 30 minutes and they would give us a slight discount. Really? After you couldn't do it the first time? When there is NO ONE around to serve its going to take LONGER? I am going to allow you to let me sit with my growling stomach for another 30 minutes while you may or may not complete a correct order?! NO. No more. We are done.

I do not know what is up with that place. They really do NOT want to make food for people. Let alone good food nor ANY food. So after eating there for almost my entire time in AZ, we are done. RIP Buonos. We nor anyone else should ever return there. Ever."}
{"text":"I don't know what has been going on at Buonos, but their service is really becoming horrible lately.  Told 35 minutes for a pickup order, an hour later the cheese sticks are cold and the pizza is finally ready.  This is at least the 3rd time in a row this has happened.  Come on, don't ruin my favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"I've always loved this place, in fact, I stuck by them even after they were bought out and the service became horrific, but at least the food was still reliable. Well guess What? Looks like they've been sold again. We stopped by last Saturday night around 815 and were told they were closed, despite the couple at a table enjoying a pair of giant salads. The lady who readily dismissed our request for a meal told us theyll be changing the name of the place and redecorating. But I have to say that shutting down at 8 pm on a Saturday? Not the smartest  business plan. We took our business to nellos, and I have a feeling we'll stick with them from now on. The foods good, they stay open for business, and their waitresses actually smile. It's a nice change."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've had in the Valley since moving back from NY 8 years ago."}
{"text":"Well to start I 've been going to this pizza place for years.  They must have changed owners or something because it keeps going downhill.  Last night my son in law got a pizza from Buenos. I was the worst pizza I've ever had.  The crust was so thin . I love thin crust pizza,  I'm from New York.   But this was ridiculous and the edge of the crust was black (yes burnt black) the cheese mix was weird too. I hope they improve or else they've lost a long time customer.  The cheesy garlic bread was good. 
Not great but good.  I hate to give a bad review but I have to be honest. I love pizza , but not last night's. Sorry Buenos."}
{"text":"So sad. Buono's used to be the most authentic New York pizza in Arizona. We got a large pizza tonight and the crust was seriously gross. Way too thick, undercooked, and not much flavor - definitely a surprise and not like any pizza I've ever had from Buono's in the last 25 years. I never thought I'd write a negative review of this place, but wow."}
{"text":"Been coming here over 20 years. When the brothers ran the place. It was the best in town. Even then it needed an overhaul. But now the place looks filthy, it's falling apart and the smell upon entering makes me want to turn and run. But...I didn't. I got 2 slices to go. It's not the worst but can't get beyond one slice. Can't taste the sauce, the cheese has a sour taste. Crust and dough were pretty good. Mine was not soggy. It's defiantly not NY pizza anymore. Quite frankly, I don't even think NY has NY pizza anymore."}
{"text":"hubby's from Chicago, so its not too often I get to go have a slice of delicious thin-crusted NY style pizza...so this was a treat, and a really great one at that!

The service was friendly, the pizza DELICIOUS, the atmosphere very \"New York-y\".  The price, fine with me.

This pizza was better than the pizza I had in New York just a month ago.
 Even my Chicago style devotee hubbs admitted to enjoying the leftovers I brought him :)"}
{"text":"Not the best location.  Had to ask if we should sit ourselves. No sign or anything explaining that.  Definitely a neighborhood dive.  Decor hadn't been updated since 1980.  Our waitress (the owner?) never smiled.  The other waitress could have covered up some.  Looked like she was going to a club. Try explaining that to your 10 year old son :-)   Kitchen was open so I got to watch one guy do all the work while muscular short dude stood around.   Lots of takeout while we were there.  Restaurant full of smoke when we walked in.  Son had a slice of cheese pizza.  The pizza slice was on the smallish side but he said it was good.  I ordered a calzone with meatballs and mushrooms.  Lots of mushrooms but not much meatball.  Almost nonexistent.  Tons of ricotta too.  Almost to the point of being too much. It was cheap but probably won't go back."}
{"text":"The sad part is I absolutely love the food here.  The negative is that if management doesn't get it's head out of a place it shouldn't be there won't be any customers.  The message is simple I understand changing hour but post them on your website.  This place is only open til 9 on Thursday , Friday and Saturday otherwise they close at 8.  I got off work called them on the phone and confirmed they were open until 9.  I picked up my wife and we showed up at 8:10.  They had a sign on the door cash only and the door was locked.  There were two employees inside who would not even acknowledge me.  The attitude of this place makes me think they do not care about their customers.  After confirming they were open not 15 min earlier until 9 and knowing I was on my way is a hell of a way to lose loyal customers.  I would love an explanation of why they don't even follow their own rules."}
{"text":"I used to love Buono's, but over the past year or so, I feel like it's gone downhill.  Service was never their strong suit, but lately it just seems like they can't be bothered.

They've also changed their crust - the past two times, it was no longer the NY style crust they used to have.  It's still a chewy, thin crust, but it's different.  And their wings are horrible.  Possibly the worst wings I've ever had.

Sorry, Buono's.  It's not me, it's you.  TIme for us to see other people, i guess."}
{"text":"I NEVER write yelp reviews. NEVER. I have to in this case. I remember Buonos being good years ago so decided to try it again for takeout. The food was awful, I took one bite of the thin and thick crust pizzas and could not believe how bad it was. We also ordered knots and wings. The wing sauce was edible, that was the only redeeming part of the meal. It was also overpriced and the service was slow and sketchy taking and preparing the order, even for takeout. Steer clear of this place!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I read the reviews AFTER I purchased a Groupon for take out.  This pizza is delicious, and I would have missed it had I read the reviews & not bought the Groupon.  I guess people only take the time to review when they are upset?  
Anyways, I called in my order, told them I'd be there in 25 minutes, pizza was ready & hot.  The small was about the size of a smallish large.  Delicious chewy crust, right amount of sauce  (order extra if you like it saucy), and WHOLE MILK cheese.  They gave me a container of grated parmesan, even it was top quality.
The person who said this pizza is comparable to a grocery store pizza must be on drugs (not weed, he doesn't have the munchies)
My new go-to pizza place.  Looking forward to trying the wings."}
{"text":"Closest thing to New York pizza I've found in years. Close to my house I've been coming here for years first time I've yelped it though."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years.  Bought a Groupon last month and went to use it.  Was told  they had new owners and were not taking Groupons purchased prior the new owner buying the restaurant.  Then we found out this was told to us by THE NEW OWNER, who went on to say, \"The prior owner, my brother, sitting over there with his family (a table filled with about 8 people) signed up with Groupon.  I don't take the ones he signed up for.\"  

He did agree to take $5 off our total bill.  We were there so decided to stay, though not thrilled!  

Buono's pizza has ALWAYS been our families favorite.  But on this night, it was just \"ok\", nothing special.  Much less sauce and cheese on the pie.  To make matters worse, both my husband & I had terribly upset stomachs that night!  

Won't be going back unfortunately."}
{"text":"I had seen this place several times and finally decided to stop in. I'm glad I did! This is by far one of the best NY style pizzas I've had in the valley. The pizza was delicious and their wings were very tasty. I now have my go to pizza parlor."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good pizza place with ont too bad prices we had wings and the sausage pizza. The sausage is the sliced type rather than the meatball type and it was really good. Large was actually large and pretty cheap at $12 for a 16\"! The crust was milky and good and the wings were not too bad, meaty and moist not dry like other places. The restaurant itself is a little homely less jazzy than native NY-er but clean and friendly. Staff was cool too."}
{"text":"As I was walking into the restaurant the over powering smell of old oil hit me. As I walked in I about gagged but decided to give it a try. While I waited for my chicken parm sandwiches I looked around. Tables were dirty, rugs stained old and dirty. Windows had fingerprints all over. I should have left.   Really. The girl was very kind as she handed me my sandwiches $19.35 later. It was the grossest sandwich EVER. Not Italian. Pieces of chicken, very little cheese covered in oregano. It has to of had switched owners because I've eaten there before and it was great. I ended up throwing it out and went to Taco Bell.  I. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"Meg and I were in the mood for a lazy night in and decided to try out a new place to pick up pizza from. We decided on Buono's because it was close by and had a lot of good reviews, including some from our friends here on Yelp.

I can't speak to the dine-in experience since we took it home. But there was definitely no confusion on what style pizza to expect. New York memorabilia everywhere you look! Very open dining are with plenty of space and a couple TVs on the walls in places that can be easily seen depending on where you sit. Would be a good place to meet up with some friends and watch a game.

Staff seemed friendly enough but since we were doing a pick-up order we didn't really talk to them very much.

The pizza on the other hand was a bit disappointing. We decided to get a 14\"  Neapolitan style pepperoni pizza. The first thing we notices when we got the pizza home was a load of grease. Given the type of pizza we got I expected some grease from the pepperoni but this was more than a little.  Cheese didn't really have much flavor and the dough wasn't very memorable. I kind of expected more for being around as long as they have.

Admittedly, it may have been a bad night and maybe the Sicilian would have been better. You'll have to decide for yourself. As for me though, it may be a while before I give Buono's another go."}
{"text":"I LOVES ME SOME BUONO'S!!!!  I used to eat here at least once a week and I was 30lbs heavier.  Now I'm skinny but I still love to go to Buono's once in awhile, order a large cheese, and sit on my couch in my underwear and eat the whole thing.  I don't have a binge eating disorder -- it is just THAT GOOD.  The sauce, the crust, the cheese...all of it is perfect.  The cheesesteak is the best I've ever had.  

Service can be a little dodgy at times, but whatever.  I'm there for the food.  And if anything it just adds to the real New York/New Jersey ambiance.  I LOVE YOU BUONO -- whoever you are."}
{"text":"The  food was okay but customer service could be more respectful ! I had a Groupon for dine in only and I called on a Saturday morning at 11 o'clock and talk to girl and said I had a dine in only groupon but I wanted to order three or four pizzas for my grand daughters party. She said they would honor the groupon. even though it's a dine in only seeing I wanted to order four pizzas. When I called at 2 o'clock to order the pizzas a man answered and he said no -The Groupon is for dine in only and I should've talked to a manager.   I said I called earlier and had a girl confirm and that he is putting me in awkward position!  He said I could not use it and stressed to me to read the groupon that it was dine in only!  He was rude and it makes no sense to me that they missed an order of four large pizzas vs going in and having one!!!"}
{"text":"As authentic N.Y. style pizza as I have come across in the East Valley.  I was born and raised in N.Y. so I can attest to this. The only problem I had is that they ran out of sausage the night I was there.  How can a pizza joint run out of sausage toppings.  Next time I will call ahead to make sure they have some."}
{"text":"The pizza here is THE BEST in town. I grew up in New Jersey, and these pies would make the wise guys at the bada bing go bada boom, if you know what I'm sayin'...eh? EH? Capisce?"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and personable. The dinning room was a little hot but we are between seasons so it's understandable. They give you a lot of food for the price (portions are huge). Everything we ordered was delicious!! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Best white pizza in town! Love the cheese sticks too. Clean tables and friendly servers."}
{"text":"Buono's pretty consistently delivers a good pizza.  The crust is the best I've had in the valley- it's ultra thin and just crisp on the bottom.  The sauce is really great and they are liberal with the cheese, but don't drown the rest of the flavors.  It can get a little greasy, but that's easily remedied with a napkin.

I really love the pizza from Buono's. but I've learned to keep it simple.  The meat toppings (pepperoni, sausage) are delicious and have a nice spice.  Vegetable toppings is when things start to get a little soggy.  I would advise staying away from tomatoes or spinach.  The spinach was obviously frozen chopped spinach and the tomatoes, though fresh, were in large slices with all the seeds and slime- my pizza was a wet mess.

The service is good, but I wouldn't call it friendly.  There is a younger set of employees recently and they definitely have attitude."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE this place when the NY Momma ran it, sadly, it seems they sold and the food as well as service is sub-par.

It is very hit or miss if your food is decent or not. regardless of either, they are painfully S L O W so, don't go for service.

Don't have high expectations on your food either.  :(

NY lady!!? Come back and kick them into shape! You rocked it when you ran it, these guys are ruining your good name!"}
{"text":"This place used to ROCK. The best NY style pizza in valley...hands down!! My son and I bought a Groupon, not having been there in like 2 years. Well, I will be short and blunt...the pizza SUCKS now. Period. The 2 brother ran a great pizza joint and the pizza was spot on..now....blaaauuuhh. They use cheap cheese, the sauce was kinda sweet and bland. And the crust was a lot thicker than it used to be. and on top of that...sh*tty slow service. Not going back anymore. Very sad!"}
{"text":"I'm from long island and I went here 15 years ago looking for some good pie. It was very good. Had Italians working in back. 
This time wasn't so good. No Italians!!I ordered garlic knots. That were cut pieces of loaf bread. Really?tasted horrible.  Also ordered pizza which tasted good. But the place has changed and doesn't feel like a NY pizza joint anymore."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Buono's for years and it is the best in Arizona.  The price is awesome and the service is great."}
{"text":"Checked out this place from the groupon last night. Friday night at 750 most tables were full ONE server. ordered our food, the the wings that were small and undercooked with generic sauce. got some garlic bread that we did enjoy. we had our drinks and all 3 cups were empty with some ice and I put them at the end of the table hoping the ONE server would notice, we had to call her over for refills, she said for which ones...... (I should have said only the EMPTY ones) ALL of our dishes from the garlic bread and wings sat on the table the ENTIRE time. we ordered the White pizza and realized when we got it there was no ricotta on it. I didnt want to complain I was tired of this place. The table behind us never had their pizza put in and they sat after us, and barely got their pizza as we were talking out the door. OIL everywhere on the pizza. That should not happen with white pizza. Here is the kicker, from about 820pm (FRIDAY NIGHT) they turned away 3 groups of people because \"they had NOTHING left in the kitchen\" Really? you put out a groupon not preparing for the influx of customers?!?!??! Those people will NEVER come back when a pizza place is OUT OF FOOD at 845. such an embarressment. Will not come back again"}
{"text":"Okay folks. For those of you who don't know already. Vic BUONO, the original Buono opened up Nicantoni's quite a few years ago. He's on Gilbert Rd between Warner & Elliot. If you want the real deal, check me out."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant we found it from Groupon. Small little place, not that clean, silverware is cheap and stained, bathrooms are disgusting.  So we weren't sure what to expect from this first impression plus the pricing on the menu was so low we decided to only order pizza, we were afraid of what an $8 order for a pasta dinner might end up being.  

Salads arrived and we were surprised, they were fairly large with fresh greens and good dressing, not from a package.  The pizza arrived, we ordered half white sauce and half red sauce, one side ham and tomato the other ham and pineapple.  It was GREAT! Nice thin crust, cheese was good and toppings adequate for quantity.  The pizza was pretty oily, like another reviewer wrote , I'm not complaining just letting you know.  We couldn't stop gushing as we walked out the door by what a great meal it was and such a good deal and we wondered about how good that spaghetti would have been had we ordered it. 

An extra large pizza for $12.99 and we walked out with plenty left over for tomorrow. I would have given this a 4 star rating or more if the place had been cleaner and the silverware not dirty."}
{"text":"Despite browsing through the more recent negative reviews. I came back hoping to have the same experience I did 10 years ago as a Dobson high student. 

Nothing has changed pizza wise. I was relieved! It's clean and looks the same as it always did. It's clearly under new management but is NOT an issue fellow former Buono's customers. 

Great NY style pizza, it's a fav!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in town. Actually, anywhere I've tried! Im pretty sure they are straight out of new york so you have to put up with Yankees decorations but they are delicious. It's our family's favorite place to go"}
{"text":"We really loved this place even when it changed owners. Well they changed owners again and forget about it. The kid who makes the pizza is an idiot and consistently burns the pizza. Confronted him about and he says well the top isn't burnt. WTF? Told him that's it you lost a customer. His response... that's ok we have lost a lot of customers and I am looking for a new job anyway. Wow really? Stay clear of this place as they have no pride in their work. It's a shame because the pizza was good when it wasn't burnt."}
{"text":"1 star for the exceptional service & extra slow food preperation. 
2 stars for the extra greasy pizza

I purchased a groupon for this place and finally got around to using it. I wasn't in a hurry to use it even tho it had an expiration date because I called, spoke to somebody & they ensured me it wouldn't expire. 

Walked into this place and had a hard time choosing the least dirty booth/table but finally made my choice and wiped off the left overs crumbs left on the table and seats. I guess with only 1 waitress it's hard to take care of a couple tables so we had to wait a good 15-20 for a greeting. No big deal..... It just meant we had plenty of time to second guess our ordering decisions. Which was a good thing because they were out of this & out of that on an early Saturday night. Really?? We ordered a simple pepperoni pizza and it took over an hour for them to prepare and deliver it to our table. There was enough grease on this pizza to save the govt millions in vehicle maintenance but since I'm not in the habit of bailing out the fat cats I quickly used an entire trees worth of napkins to solve the issue. A little grated cheese, stale crushed peppers, garlic salt and voialla & edible pizza. The pizza actually has good flavor and I enjoyed the crust which normally I don't. I didn't want to chance my luck with letting down my taste buds so we opted out on the potentially fake Italian desert. 

So here's where Bouno's helped establish their excellent one star review with me. The waitress brought the bill & I gave here my groupon. She quickly made an excuse on not taking the groupon because it was expired & I showed her on the groupon where it says it NEVER EXPIRES so she took it to her boss. A $12 dollar groupon discount turned into a $6 discount. Nothing makes me more sadder than a business not living up to their offer. Don't put it out there if you have no honor. Well, to wrap this up I'm gonna say good by to Bouno's & wish them luck cuz they're gonna need it if they plan on staying in business with such awesomeness."}
{"text":"I gotta say, it was decent. The atmosphere was reminiscent of my childhood hangouts. The pizza was descent. 
You may be thinking, \"Descent? Fours stars for 'decent'?\" 
Well, let me explain. 

17 years ago, I was ripped from the pizza haven that was my first home (after the womb, but just as comfortable), Long Island, NY. The reasons are unclear to me still. I was a vulnerable nine year old uprooted and moved to the cruel and often cold (metaphorically, not literally) Sonoran Desert, I had no way to cope with my new surroundings. Oreos just did not fill the void in my empty pit of a stomach, which I was quickly trying to fill with something familiar. 
That something familiar was a good, thin and crunchy crust, extra sauce, light on the cheese, pie. Pizza pie. 
No one could provide for me. I was desolate. Pizza places came and went. A sauce here, a sauce there. 

Eventually I learned to cope on my own without the crutch that was the perfect slice. I live for my semi annual trips back to the pizza- womb that is Greenwich Village, but when I am feeling just a little nostalgic, just a little emotional... a slice from Buono's will suffice. 

And that is why I give 4 stars."}
{"text":"You want a good tasting pie? You got one.

Brought to their doorstep by a Living Social voucher, my GF and I cashed in and got a large pepperoni and two soft drinks. I was impressed by their speedy service and liked the NYC charm of the metal counter. I think it's family operated because we were served by a real nice lady who chatted with us briefly and made us feel like we were welcomed into her home. 

The pizza was big and floppy, yet still maintained a good crispy crust. Overall, a really well made pizza and dining experience. The value is also reasonable, especially if you've got a voucher or coupon.

If I lived closer, this would be my go-to spot. The only thing keeping Buono's from five stars is along the sames lines as why MANY pizza places can't be given five stars - what's distinguishing it from the place down the street? Regardless, if you're in the area, I highly recommend checking these guys out."}
{"text":"I'm from NY so I know pizza. No I'm not from upstate almost to Canada I'm from the city born and raised in Queens. I was raised on some of the best pizza in the country. This is as close to perfect as it gets in Az. Ever week we call for a pick up order, not only is it ready quick and always right, on multiple occasions they've answered the phone \"large cheese and a dozen wings mild, see you in 20.\"
Now that's friggin service right there! Keep it up boys!"}
{"text":"I work next to this place...it's out of business so please dont waste your time coming over here..."}
{"text":"Best pizza that Ive had in Arizona, Neapolitan or otherwise, and Ive been around the state chompin' through many a slice. I grew up on this stuff, and its always a treat to grab a pie from here when I find myself in the phoenix area.

The secret to a great New York pie is the crust and the sauce. Anyone can buy good quality mozzarella. The crust here is perfect. Thin and yet chewey. Chewey and yet light. Cooked to perfection. The sauce is home-made and takes them a full 24 hours to create. Even still has a little tomato skin left in it which may sound like a bad thing, but trust me, its not. The sauce is thin and mild, and they apply it in just the right amount so as to compliment the cheese and crust perfectly. Theres really just not enough good things I can say about this pizza.

Price is ok, not amazing, but worth every penny. Wait times can be a bit long if theyre busy, but usually they're pretty expedient. I can't say it enough: this is really good pizza. Go get some."}
{"text":"Ordered from Grub Hub. Just received my freezing cold pizza and garlic bread 2 and 1/2 hours after ordering. The pizza was also incorrect and when I called the store to ask about my food the person on the phone seemed annoyed I was calling a second time and didnt seem to care. WILL NOT be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Went here recently for the first time. It was okay. Unfortunately I ordered pasta. It was overcooked, and didn't even have the mushrooms and olives that I asked for. My husband got pizza, and I tried a bite. The pizza was good. We did have the garlic knots as an appetizer, and they were pretty good. Customer service was meh. The girl Aleah, who was serving us kept smiling like she was trying not to laugh. It made for a really awkward dinner. I'd come back for the pizza, but nothing else. I probably won't be back though. If I'm going out for pizza, I go to Venezia's Pizzeria. Their pizza is amazing, good prices, and their staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"Very disappointed that the original owners aren't there anymore .. They used to be very good and very close to New York Pizza , now the pizza is horrible . It's either under cooked or burnt . I wouldn't recommend a Sicilian pie , they have no clue . The chicken parm hero is soggy ..  I had to wait over an hour and a half for my pizza bc it was either burnt or they gave it away . I would never go back"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? It used to be such a gem and now its a very sad shell of what it used to be. You can barely even order over the phone anymore, because the person taking your order is apparently having a dozen other conversations while talking to you. 

It's such a shame to watch such a beloved and revered place go down in flames due to poor quality control and customer service. I would love to see this local business come back to greatness."}
{"text":"I ordered a salad with Italian dressing, I received ranch, took it back and she denied ever hearing Italian. I also ordered pepperoni, and received only a cheese pizza.The soda had some weird nasty film covering the top of the drink, and the whole glass. LASTLY, best part, there was a big dead moth in my salad. Maybe I just had bad luck this day but, this place has gone down hill. Clean your crap and listen to people when they order food."}
{"text":"We love Buonos pizza! Its so delicious and greasy and good!

But they do not answer their phone. We have tried calling today upwards of 10 times, and alas! No answer. Cant even leave an angry message. It is the most infuriating thing. We are going to go to Nello's pizza instead.."}
{"text":"We love Buono's but they should really post their hours on the building. This is the second time we've been met by locked doors and no sign."}
{"text":"Best NY pizza spot in AZ!

Seat yourself type of restaurant where you can also order up front. Simple, quick, effective service is offered, but the pizza is what you go here for. 

Been at least 50 times and it never disappoints. Typically grab a whole pie just cheese since the flavor is incredible. Pepperoni, sausage, etc. also is tasty. Salads are simple and wings are better than Native New Yorker's. 

Do yourself a favor and go to Buono's more sooner than later."}
{"text":"We live around the corner so I purchased a groupon to try it. It was hands down the worst pizza I've had. Soggy, greasy, lacking in flavor. My kids will eat anything and they even made comments. I don't like leaving negative reviews, but I felt that you should be warned if you're considering it. There are several other places within a mile with much better, less expensive pizza."}
{"text":"I really don't have anything significant to report... 

Been here twice in the last few years... Food's not bad, staff is courteous, but other, local pizza parlors & restaurants quickly outshine Buono's... I live nearby and eat-out often, but I tend to forget about this place when deciding where to go. 

To be fair, I really should eat here again soon to get a fresh perspective (and give my review more credence)... 

I'll keep you posted!"}
{"text":"This was the most horrible food I have ever had.  I asked for the sausage roll extra crispy and it came absolutely burnt (SEE PICURE).  As for the pizza Tombstone Frozen Pizza tastes better  When I called to complain to ask how come they would serve product that was unedible  I was hung up on.  This restaurant used to be decent at best.  Now it had really hit the level of terrible dining.  I can't imagine the new location is any better if it is run by the same morons"}
{"text":"Great customer service and overall quality of pizza! Loved the feel of the place and style :)"}
{"text":"I would be happy to shed some truthful light on Buono's. They USE to be my favorite pizza place in the valley. I started eating here about 5 years ago.That is when the original owners still ran it. They are the ones that opened it, and decorated it, and were actually from NY. They took pride in the customer service and quality of food. They sold the business to another family about 1-2 years ago, and ever since the quality of food, and the customer service has been on a rapid decline. The prices have gone up and the quality has gone down. They overcharge for everything as you will notice when you look at their menu with the pizza sizes altered by writing in different sizes with pen. What use to be a medium is now a large, large is now an X-Large and so on. The truly amazing part is the sizes haven't actually changed, they just charge more. This is in addition to watered down sauces, dressings and overcharging for every little thing, and getting orders correct is apparently impossible. I called today because I wanted to order a Supreme pizza which can be found pretty much anywhere. I was told that they don't have a Supreme and it would be $1.50 extra for each of the 5 toppings. An extra $7.50 for a Supreme pizza!? No thanks they can keep their low quality high priced food. This is the last chance I was willing to give this once great place to get authentic NY style pizza. I have to come to terms with the fact the the REAL Buono's is dead, and the new owners killed it!"}
{"text":"I want some Buono's right now :(

I like that this place is divey with a huge flat screen television and a bunch of junk on the walls. Also it is pretty dim in here so you can pig out in relative anonymity, well not really it's not that dark in here but you get the picture. Pizza was pretty good and they sell slices if you don't want to commit to a whole pizza. So far so good, that's really all I have to say since I only tried the pizza. PIzza slices are 1.95 and .50 for each topping."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves loves loves this places pizza.

To be quite honest yes its good enough for 9.99 mon-wed for 1 topping. I refuse to spend more than that here unless my bf is craving it.  Personally id rather go to bashas down the street for 6.99 for pepperoni pizza freshly made when you call.  So far i still have yet to find a pizza joint where i LOVE LOVE LOVE their pizza so much that i crave it. I don't know exactly what it is that i do not love this place just as much as my boyfriend... the grease maybe? i am not a huge fan of drippy pizza. i do not care about the stretchy cheese not being real thing i just want pizza with awesome flavor. If we don't get bashas i am okay with this as long as it was only 9.99. Have not tried any of their calzones or wings, someday i will though. Skip the fried zucchini and mushrooms not that great here."}
{"text":"Great pizza place in the area...was in town for business.  They have specials Monday-Wednesday I believe.  Got a large pizza for $9.99.  Great tasting and service was great.  They have TV's, so you are able to watch a sporting game while enjoy a slice a pizza.  They also sell pizza by the slice as well."}
{"text":"****UPDATE*****
11/17/17..
Was so excited for this. yes i gave em a glowing review a few months ago.. but something was off.. the pizza wasnt as tasty. kind of a bummer since i raved about this place. the most recent influx of bad reviews have a common thread; Buono's used to be amazing, but now not so much. idk whats going on here. Please Buonos if you are reading this, up your game, give a sh*t, and get back on top of whats important, the pizza. for the love of god, please fix things, i really want to see this place get back to how great it was. 
5/2/17..
Best pizza in the valley. Edit; best EAST COAST STYLE pizza in the valley. Hands down. Used to think Venezios was all that. Nope. Buonos CRUSHES Them. This pizza reminds me of growing up on the jersey shore (not a friggin BENNY). Pizza is super thin, crust is very thin. Not too much sauce, and the sauce is slightly sweet. Perfect amount of cheese. And that glorious orange grease that is the signature of any true east coast pie. Absolutely delicious. So all you Bozos & Dingbats who are complaining about this pizza being too thin and greasy can go take a long walk off a short pier. True, authentic, east coast pie (NYC & NJ) can be found here at Buono's. Yankees stuff decorates the interior. No nonsense gruff dude flipping pies. Dudes in adidas track suits wearing gold chains having lunch. Respect. Number one."}
{"text":"Hear ye. Hear ye! Buono's is the last bastion of 'Good' New-York-style pizza in the valley. That's it. Simple as that. Please give these guys your business. Help keep their doors open. 

Don't expect expect plush accomodations. Expect a business that is STRUGGLING to make a profit and keep its doors open while providing you with the best quality and value they can amid economic pressure. 

With last year's closing of Prima Pizza, in Gilbert, Buono's is the lone, worthy, New-York style pizza place in the valley. Looking at Yelp, I see few reviews concentrating on Buono's quality and taste and more from folks with petty grievances and/or those that don't get economic implications facing ALL small businesses. I'm concerned these might dissuade new business for Buono's (the regulars know how good it is).

So don't pay attention to vacuous reviewers that talk about increased prices and reduced portions. These folks don't get economics and probably vote to hike minimum wage at every opportunity with zero understanding of the implications. I truly don't care how you vote, but folk should really understand the domino-effect of their choices.

My daughter and I went to Buono's this evening for a take out order, a large pepperoni and an order of hot wings extra crispy. Crowd pleaser for sure. My house is 20-25 minutes away, but all the food was awesome on arrival home.

The pizza was outa-this-world good. The wings were crispy and tasty... on par with the best wings in the Valley.

The service was OK. The shop def seemed understaffed for a Friday. Everything came on time with quality, it just seems that the staff is overworked. That's a management/ownership issue. Take heed folks, people need to \"feel\" good to come back. If they feel bad about stressing your workers, your establishment is in deep trouble.

The staff helping me this evening was not the most out-going or friendly. But the take-out job got done. Big thanks. But work on showing your customers that you value them.

I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Finally writing a review after I had pizza from another place yesterday that left a lot to be desired. I love this place - one of the best NY style pizza's in the valley. Always the right amount of cheese and sauce. Flavor is awesome! Been going to them for years. One of those hole in the wall gems! (Haven't tried anything besides the pizza here)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is totally like walking into NYC. Lots of memorabilia from the city.  They are huge baseball fans.  The food is averaged priced but the pizza was not the NY style I prefer. My last visit yesterday everything was really salty.  It's kid friendly."}
{"text":"Pizza was soggy and limp and just not the same. I don't want to eat a slice with knife and fork! I should have checked the reviews only to find out it was sold! That makes sense since the pizza before was awesome. Will not be going back unfortunately. The wings were good but hard to mess that up."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Sunday afternoon. It was not busy at all, we were greeted by our waitress and she took our drink orders. We looked over the menu which has a variety of options from pizza to chicken wings and many other Italian dishes yo choose from. We opted for the X-Large Neapolitan which is the thin round crust. We added 4 toppings which they charge 5.75 for!!  I couldn't believe it, but what's a pizza without toppings so I sucked it up and paid for them. We ordered Sausage, onions, black olives and green peppers.
When our pizza was brought out, it looked good at first, until I picked up the slice and the toppings almost slid off, the crust was very soggy and the pizza was super greasy. It was like they way over greased the pan. There were thin slices of sausage, not the big chunky kind, plenty of black olives and peppers and large slices of onions. When all the slices were off the pan you could the grease sitting in puddles on the pan. No wonder I had cramps about 30 minutes after eating.
The restaurant itself is clean, with tasteful decor depicting its New York roots. The bathroom was clean and service was good."}
{"text":"I was brought to Buono's from a Groupon purchase.  It's very close to our home and I was hopeful to find some good pizza.  During my first experience a cute young girl was our server.  She was the only server for a whole restaurant full of people and she was also the counter person that took the order.  She was nice and friendly, but our service wasn't fabulous because one person can only do so much for an entire restaurant full of people.  From the point we received our food she came back only at the end to give us a box and I had to go up to the counter to pay our check because we had somewhere we needed to be.  I thought maybe someone had called out sick or something.  The pizza was thin, cheesy, and greasy.  It was good,  but it didn't wow me.
We decided to give it another chance, so we went back.  This time we had white pizza and a sausage roll.  Our waitress was the same girl.  The service situation was the same which leads me to believe that they just don't have enough people scheduled to work ever.  The girl who works there is nice and friendly and I saw her and the other 2 kitchen employees that were there running around and doing their best.  I felt bad for them because I've worked in numerous restaurants over the years and I felt like they were set up to fail.  The sausage roll came out 10 minutes before my pizza did.  It's always awkward when you go out to eat and one person is completely finished with their food before the other even receives their.  The sausage roll was the poorest excuse for a sausage roll I've ever seen.  It was doughy and not very flavorful.  If you decide to try this place stick to pizza with marinara sauce. The white pizza was bland and also not very flavorful.  If you decide to try this place stick to pizza with marinara sauce. I would have liked to have had some red pepper to pizazz it up, but our server was unable to come back and check on us because she was too busy.  Also I overheard at least 2 sets of customers that came in to order pizza and ended up leaving because they were told the wait was very long.  I applaud her for letting them know about the long wait up front because that's the right thing to do.  However, I feel like the management needs to hire some more employees because you should never be turning away people because you're too busy.  Lastly, I've seen other people mention this on their review, but we reeked of and oil/smoke odor after we left.  I'm not sure if there is a problem with ventilation but it was unpleasant."}
{"text":"We come all the way from ne Scottsdale for this pizza.  My husband swears they put butter on it."}
{"text":"Not sure if anyone else was able to use their Groupon here, but I wasn't able to...that was a bummer. Our neighbor super-hyped us about Buono's and highly recommended this place so when I saw a Groupon for it, I bought it. 

But when we went for lunch one Saturday, there was a sign on the window saying they were not accepting Groupons. So I had to notify Groupon for a refund--that took a few days but I eventually got my refund processed. I think at least a few people had contacted them about Buono's because I received a mass email from Groupon apologizing for Buono's Groupon not being valid anymore and I also received a personalized message from the Groupon customer support shortly after.

Anyways, on to the food. We started off with spicy honey wings as an appetizer. DELICIOUS! The sauce was tangy and flavorful (although not spicy enough, but we have a high tolerance) and the wings were gone in a flash. We had high hopes for the pizza...

I had a mushroom/spinach/tomato slice and a sausage/mushroom Sicilian slice. Well, I had actually ordered the veggie slice to be on a white-garlic sauce style, but the sauce wasn't prepared yet (boo) so I had to get it in the traditional style. 

The mushroom/spinach/tomato slice was very sad-looking. The mushrooms were the canned kind!!! Blasphemy!!! And the amount of veggies was pretty skimpy. The sausage/mushroom slice was not my cup of tea, but I don't know if I'm just not fond of the Sicilian style. 

My husband ordered the calzone and was veeerrrrryyyy disappointed with it. The crust wasn't good and overcooked to the point of being rock-hard so it was kind of a pain to eat. Usually he scarfs down his calzones quickly (it's his first choice at italian places), but we left with 3/4 of the calzone intact and I ended up having to toss it when I was cleaning out the fridge because he didn't eat the leftovers. 

All in all, it wasn't a great meal. But we really did like the wings so maybe when we have a craving we may order them from Buonos for takeout."}
{"text":"Came here on 12/29/14 and I ordered pepperoni pizza and my mother ordered Spaghetti, both cam with salads. When I got my pizza it was extremely grease and limp, nothing at all like New York pizza should be, and my moms spaghetti sauce was 95% water, when you moved the pasta it was just water and grease and her meatballs were all burnt. Overall very disappointed with my experience here ):"}
{"text":"My Favorite local pizza! I prefer my pizza a little greasier and crispier on the bottom, but this is the best I've found since moving here from Philly. The wings are ok, I wish they'd double grill them. The eggplant parm is amazing. French fries are really good too, esp if you get them well done. And I'm pretty sure they make their own ranch. Yummm :D"}
{"text":"I used to love this place when Jimmy owned it, and was a dedicated customer for over 10 years.  Their pizza was unbeatable, the service was awesome and it was a great business to be a patron of.

The new ownership is rude, inconsiderate and the food is absolutely awful.  

I literally walked out of there telling them they sucked and that I would write this review for them - that's how rude and bad it was even dealing with them.  Then after trying the garbage I just paid for, my wife and I have agreed we will never give them our business again.

Stay away, far far away.  This place was a legend and now is a dump."}
{"text":"Being from Tucson, I naturally think Brooklyn's is the best New York style pizza.  I went along with my boyfriend to Buono's on a recent trip to Phoenix, and watched them create pizza after delicious-looking pizza starting with what is clearly home-made pizza dough.  They then coat it in a sauce the likes of which I have never seen on a pizza before.  It was thin, and I expected a watery taste, but it was anything but.

The crust was out of this world.  It is thin and chewy and flavorful.  The sauce was bursting with flavors of tomatoes and garlic, and the mozzarella was thick but not overpowering to the other flavors.  

I only had the cheese pizza here, his reasoning being that to truly judge a pizza place, you need to evaluate their cheese pizza.  I can't wait for the next trip to Phoenix to try another offering!"}
{"text":"Love Buono's! Lunch specials are great- 2 slices (w/ 1 topping) and a fountain soda for $5. They crisp up the pizza in their over so you get that NYC style feel of ordering from the counter on Broadway. Dough is excellent, sauce is great, and they offer lots of options for toppings. A friend usually gets the wings and says they're good (they look tasty), so you can opt for the pizza & wing lunch option as well. The staff is friendly, establishment is clean all the time- lots of TV's tuned into ESPN so you can catch up on scores, etc. This place is sort of a hidden gem, check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"After watching my sister try on wedding dress after wedding dress after wedding dress after freaking wedding dress all day, pizza and Netflix sounded like a well-earned evening. 

I wanted to shake things up from our normal pizza routine (two other NY Style places, one in Mesa and one on Arizona Avenue in Chandler) and finally got around to trying Buono's Pizza this weekend. 

It's been on my bookmarks for years with several recommendations from friends, five minute drive around the block, can't hurt.

Called in a 14-inch Neapolitan Pizza with Pepperoni ($13.95 pre-tip). The lady on the phone was friendly, and let us know that it'd be ready in 20 minutes.

Walk in, and the place is pretty cool. Nothing fancy, but covered wall to wall with New York Sports Teams Memorabilia and other affiliated decor. Divey. My kind of place! 

Got home ready to tear into some pizza and the Netflix cue. 

Slight layer of grease typical of NY Style Pizza? 

Check. 

Crust that's still substantial and crispy despite said layer of grease? 

So far, so good! 

The pizza wasn't horrible; however, nothing stood out about it in terms of flavor . . .  And this was a very simple order, the ingredients should SHINE! 

Bland sauce and unexciting cheese blend. 

Perhaps Buono's was just having an off night, but I found their pizza to just be average. Not the first place on my list next time I want to have a lazy evening in."}
{"text":"ok...The pizza is actually ok.  My girlfriend warned me that the customer service was sketchy, but I said whatever.

I got a GROUPON...It expired...I get it...You only get what you pay for, not the extra bonus...Except that when we went to use it after it expired, BUONOS said it was only for DINE IN...Our expired GROUPON did not state that.  We should still get our dumb $10 off.  But no.

So, I will not be going back.. This place is pretty good, but there are about a billion pretty good places in the Phoeinx Valley area...

Good luck Buono's with your shi**y attitude...I'm sure you will do fine, but I will root for you to fail.

{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! My boyfriend and I have been coming here for over a year and the food has always been superb  and convenient as its right around the corner from our house. Yet over the course of this time the customer service and food quality has quickly diminished. We put in a order for pick up at 507, arrived at 530 after being told 15 minutes however once we went to the register we didn't receive our food until 540. I asked the server/cashier how long the calzone had been out and he said a few minutes before we arrived, if it was out before we arrived why weren't we given our food in that moment???? And why was our food cold??? To that he replied that he had other customers and that he couldn't just worry about us???? NOT TO MENTION, that this was right in front of the owner who didn't even acknowledge the situation. Trying to disregard the fact that our food was cold and cheese unmelted, attempting to eat this was like chewing bubble gum due to the excessive cheese in this calzone. Overall terrible experience."}
{"text":"This is my initial review of this place so it might change with more visits. I tried this place for the first time this past weekend and we had a pepperoni pizza, garlic knots, hot wings, and fries. Everything was brought out quickly and everything tasted on point. I got to give them kuddoes because some places have good pizza and bad wings, but this place had both. Great customer service. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food! The pizza was very very good. We happened onto the place because of a Groupon, and despite the hole-in-the-wall first impression and greasy smell the pizza was very good. This and Jimmy Joe's are our two favorites in town. 

Unfortunately the Wing's were not near as good; they bordered on bad. That's ok, though. The pizza made up for it. We didn't try anything else. 

Read some of the reviews about the bad service. We experienced only good service, a cashier/server who was willing to explain the menu and make recommendations. He was thoughtful as he came to our table, very polite. It was a little weird that he was wearing his muscle shirt and had his body building trophies on the counter, but he was nice nonetheless. 

So our suggestion: Order the pizza, skip the wings."}
{"text":"I only picked up pizza !! The pizza was awesome !! I would sit and eat !! These people are trying and good people !!' You want fast food it's slop !! I enjoyed the pizza many times !!thanks"}
{"text":"been eating at bounos for 15 years and havent found another pizzaria as good as bounos just wish they had more locations keep up the good work we love you thanks for being so good"}
{"text":"25 years. I've been a loyal customers of Buono's Pizza for 25 years. 

Here's a hint guys, reheating an old pizza that's probably been sitting around for a few hours intended for slices isn't going to keep me coming back.  It's inexcusable for a restaurant to serve what I was served this evening. This wasn't a mistake: overcooked/undercooked it's giving a customer garbage because you don't want to take a loss on a product. 


Will not return. Ever."}
{"text":"My husband and I ventured in here after I bought a groupon. It was a Sunday afternoon about 1:30, We walked in and no one said anything to us and we didn't know if we ordered at the counter or seated ourselves. We stood at the counter for a few minutes and were not acknowledged so we had a seat and looked at a menu. It was certainly a dive. One customer was letting her toddler crawl around the floor eatting crumbs. After we sat another 10 minutes we left. The pizza may be good but well never know since we couldn't get service. Mad that I wasted 10.00 on a groupon that can't even be used for take out."}
{"text":"Buonos is Great Pizza. I'm an ex New Yorker and I've been here since 1993. It took me several years to find a place that was just like Home. This is it. It's like being in a New York Neighborhood pizzeria. Go out of your way and visit this place. you will Love it."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. One of the best we've had around here!!!  Friendly staff and great pricing too"}
{"text":"Great little pizza place!  This is a very family friendly place too, so you can bring everyone here without having to worry about noise levels.

The menu has more than pizza on it though. They have different pastas, including really delicious stuffed shells.  They have sub sandwiches, salads and great apps too.  If you need a place to grab a quick lunch during the week, Buono's is a great option.  They have pretty cheap lunch specials and serve good sized portions."}
{"text":"Being a New Yorker myself I found this pizza to be ok only!  Very heavy on the cheese and very little sauce.  No crisp to the crust, just chewy and doughy.  Although the restaurant itself reminds me of home and the menu has some great options such as italian ices, zeppones and garlic knots the pizza is not something I would rave about."}
{"text":"Buono's has taken a turn for the worse the service is  the food is worse!!!! I complained to the owner Juan  and he basically told me he doesn't care I can deal with it! I have been coming here 15 years and ever since Jimmy sold the place it's gone to Shit! 
Vic would be ashamed of what they have done!"}
{"text":"Been coming to buonos pizza my whole life, stopped in today since it's been awhile and was blown away how rude the cashier was. It was incredible, she obviously hated her job. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I used to love their white pizza but it started to come out tasting old and stale a few months back. I only eat it when I order a whole pie because then it's fresh and as delicious as ever. Their wings are pretty good and the zeppolis (sp?) are amazing. Food comes up relatively quickly and the employees are nice."}
{"text":"they have great pizza and pizza and wing specials.  I've been here at least once a week for about 4 weeks.  I only order the cheese pizza. Not the most upbeat of folks but the pizza is good."}
{"text":"Ugh, I just made my first Yelp retraction.  I wrote a review of Buono's right before they switched over to new management.  When I got the text from a friend, a twice a week customer to Buono's that they switched owners and the food is now garbage... it was like a family member died.  We had our daughters birthday here, our son and I used to go to lunch here every Saturday.... This was our family establishment.  

Sure enough my family had to try the food with the new ownership.  The pizza was garbage.  It was cheapened up... how could it be?  I was in denial.  Maybe it was an off night.  That's allowed right?  So we tried it again, this time I didn't even want to eat pizza.  I tried the meatball parm sammy (which was always my go to meal) it was horrible.  Soggy bread with tasteless meatballs... what struck me the most was this was a Friday night... it was a ghost town!  Two tables sitting at 6:30 and a 20 minute wait for the pizza.  Back in the day on a Friday night, the place was packed and an hour wait for the pizza.  

Well, it looks like I am back to square one.  I need to find a pizza place.  I am so  bummed that a place I gave 2 five star reviews now get's 1 star.  Gone are the days...."}
{"text":"Soggy pizza and greasy wings. First and last time. Staff was nice. Good just not impressive."}
{"text":"I've been going to Buono's for about 10 years now and absolutely loveD it. I don't know if ownership or management changed, but it isn't as good as it used to be for some reason.  Buono's is located in a shabby shopping center right next to a Goodwill, so don't expect it to be posh. It has low-end vinyl flooring and cheap tables.  There are all kinds of tacky \"New York\" decorations.  None of that mattered though because the pizza and wings were soooo good.  At least, they were.  The crumbly italian sausage was the absolute best around. The sausage isn't like the fake Jimmy Dean you see at most pizza places, it is larger and seems like it is shaved off a big hunk of sausage. The sausage isn't as good as it used to be, but it is still quite good and I would recommend it. I don't know why the sausage, and the pizza as a whole as a result, isn't as good, but something is just different about it.  I still like Buonos, I just don't love it anymore."}
{"text":"shitty pizza.. shittier customer service.. do your self a favor and order from Big Boy's. Bitch.. I am a customer. Don't get all snotty with me on the phone for asking questions about your specials."}
{"text":"I agree with the 2 stars. Used to be great. We tried numerous times to order by phone and no one answers!! Go there and it's just as bad. Can't believe they'd be that poorly managed."}
{"text":"On our way to Oregano's & decided to give this place a try. 7:30 on a Tuesday night. The dining room is empty except for the one man waiting for his to-go order. My son & I sit and peruse the menu. The only visible waitress is busy mopping the floor. She takes a break and asks us for our drink order. My drink shows up with some foreign film floating on top. Yuk. I call the waitress over and she sees the film and offers to bring me a new drink. Which she does, only it's in a styrofoam cup. I guess they determined that the film came from the cup so it was better to give me a styrofoam replacement even though there was no film in my sons drink. Our waitress tells us that the large cheese pizza's are $2 off tonight. Yeah, a deal. We checked out the menu and decided on an order of meatballs ($5) and a large sausage pizza ($13.49 - $2).
Meatballs: tough & small. Nothing like the picture in the menu. 3 small meatballs for $5 is not a good deal. The marinara sauce was good however.
Pizza: The sausage had a nice flavor and there was plenty on the pie. The cheese & sauce were good as well. Nothing blowing me out of the water but fine. The crust, hmm, let's just say if you looked at the pie from the bottom you would never be able to tell it was cooked.
Now I have to get a little picky. First, we had to ask for silverware, twice. The first time was when a cook delivered our meatballs. We didn't have any way to eat them so we asked our server for some silverware and she promptly brought us one set of silverware. I guess she figured my son and I would share the fork. Which we did. When she brought the pizza out we asked for another setup which she promptly brought to our table. Then we had to ask for plates. Our waitress brought us paper plates. This is my second issue; Paper plates. Really? We're dining IN not heading out for a picnic. I really hope this isn't standard issue.
Management take notice: Train your staff. This was ridiculous. After we had placed our order she should have brought us everything we were going to need, i.e. Plates, napkins, silverware, parmesan cheese, pepper flakes etc... She also took FOREVER to pick up our bill. It sat on the tray for over 10 minutes while she walked by numerous times dealing with other guests.
The thing is, good pizza places are a dime a dozen. I know this place has been here a long time but that's the problem. The kinks should have been worked out by now. There are just too many pizza joints within 3 miles in any direction that do a better job.
North - Oreganos, Big Boys
East - Barro's, Old Chicago, Nello's or Rosati's
South - Fired Pie, Pesto's
West - Classic Italian, Rosati's, Rigatony's, Miele's, Barro's
I chose this place because I had heard good things about it. I'm glad I checked it out but now having eaten there I wish we had continued on to Oregano's."}
{"text":"The pizza we had was very greasy. server was nice but I'm rating it on the food and I just can't do more than 2 stars because it was too greasy."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with 2 other Yelp friends. We shared an extra large Neapolitan pizza with 4 toppings. This was a 20\" pizza with a thin NY style crust. The waitress who took our order was soft spoken and hard to understand. She was very pleasant and attentive. The pizza sauce had a nice flavor. As we removed a couple pieces there was a layer of grease under the crust.The crust needed Viagra. It was limp. It took both hands to pick it up without loosing all the toppings. I would have liked a fork, but they there were no utensils to be found. Maybe they were paying homage to the Renaissance festival. They also broke out the fine china. We were given 4 paper plates with our pizza.  

I must point out that the service was prompt. We had our pizza quickly. I didn't have time to read all of the NY Yankee memorabilia hanging on every square inch of every wall. This place would have been rated lower, except this is a real good tasting pizza."}
{"text":"I've been going to Buonos since I was in High School at Dobson. I love this side Pizza joint. great food. the staff is kind of friendly but it's that brooklyn attitude that makes em shine."}
{"text":"Great little place, authentic NY style pizza. Our server was very friendly and attentive. Strangely enough they ran out of sausage! That didn't make the pizza any worse for wear, it was still really good! I'll definately be back."}
{"text":"I have been a customer for 20 years now.  I moved from the east valley years ago and really miss the food. I do know they have had new owners in the last ten years or so and had heard it wasn't the same. I was happy to revisit Buonos last month before an author visit at Changing Hands. Still great! One of the best NY pizza places in town. YUM! If you like that oil on top, greasy NY slice type of pizza then Buonos is for you. Manga!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened.  The first time I went here, OMG! , the  pizza was to die for, but when I returned, it became worse.  Greasy enough for Alabama ashy legs. Sorry Bunos's"}
