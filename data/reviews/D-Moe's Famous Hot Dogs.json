{"text":"Well, it is really a shame. I have been here numerous times and have had a mixed multitude of experiences here. When it is freshly made then it is \"Da-Bomb\" but when they pre-cook the dogs and the hamburgers then it is really, really bad. To me I can't look at it as being anything but pure laziness to pre-cook the food here at this small one of its kind hot-doggery. I used to rave about this place to all who I came in contact with. When they get it right it is hard to beat. They changed their hamburger that they opened with which was an awful thin frozen patty which was sliced in half and placed in a hotdog bun. It is now, when freshly cooked to order, a thick and juicy thing of palatable art which wraps its tasty goodness all around the inside of your mouth and has your tummy screaming for more, MORE, MORE!!!!!!!! But only if they cook it fresh to order. And also to D-Moe's credit it happens to be one of the very few who serve all beef hot dogs with a natural beef casing. For those of us who abstain from swine in our diet this is a major plus. 

My suggestion to the owners of D-Moe's is to make a standing order to only freshly cook to order all their food or I am sure that they will soon die the ultimate death of just another wannabe failed fast food joint. 

Please I beg of you change this and only freshly cook to order as I used to love your food and hope to once again but only if you change............"}
{"text":"Ate there today for lunch. My daughter loves hot dogs and so we thought we would give it a try. Overall it was a pretty big letdown. I wouldnt recommend it. 

The place was cool with the 50s decorations but it was a little overwhelming with so much stuff. The inside had tall stools which looked a little unsafe for my 3 year old so we opted for the picnic tables outside. 

We ordered 5 hot dogs, all diff types, sweet potato fries, reg fries and onion rings. My first complaint is that the buns tasted stale...they were very hard and not much flavor. The actual hot dog was good but I prefer five guys. The hard bun made it hard to enjoy. My daughter was not impressed. The fries were ok but def not great. The sweet potatoes fries were really greasy and not crunchy. The onion rings lacked any kind of flavor. Honestly, I think a hot dog street vendor or wawa has better hot dogs for way cheaper. 

The staff was very friendly and knowledgable and even came out to check on us to see if we needed anything.  We were the only ones at the restaurant at 12:00 on a weekday and I think we were outnumbered by the staff. 

I give it a \"eh\" and won't be back. Too bad because it seems like a cool idea."}
{"text":"Went last night with the family for the 2nd time in past 4 months, and I have to agree with the comment below - people, what are you expecting?  It's a hot dog joint and a pretty good one.  If you are expecting Morton's , this isn't it. It's a retro decorated hot dog stand. Dogs, fries, sweet potato fries, chili, etc.  All not bad and a change from the normal fast food routine. Don't go there with expectations of a gourmet meal and won't be disappointed. Kids and wife really liked it. So did I."}
{"text":"Just love this place so much!  I have been here 7 times now.  Today was the carolina dog with fries.  The hot dog was perfect but I was a little sad to see that they changed to a different French fry.  I really hope this isn't permanent because they aren't as good as the shoe string fries."}
{"text":"So this is your typical hot dog place with menu options to have your dog done any regional way in the US.  The toppings had a good list to choose from, as well as many already topped combos if you don't want to think up your own.  I tried a regular hot dog as well as the cheeseburger.  The burger was good, meat well flavored, but it comes on a hot dog bun sliced long ways.  It's a bit messy to eat, but overall was not bad compared to typical chains.  The fries were thick and hot, a little too salty, but very tasty.  The hot dog wasn't bad, although it doesn't have that flame grilled flavor one looks for in a dog.  It's a bit salty due the grease from the rotisserie style cooking method.  The price was great and its a lot of food, but a bit slow in the drive thru as I think they make orders as they get them instead of warming pre cooked food which I'm happy to wait for hot fresh food!  A few tweaks in the food, and this place could be a great 4 star fast food hot dog joint.  Will be great competition for cookout across the way!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop here during lunch time for a hotdog....not crowded; maybe 4-5 people sitting outside on wooden benches having a meal. Went to the drive thru and the cashier was very pleasant. Hot dog was good and hot, sweet potato fries were okay but the red velvet cake left something to be desired. Yuck! The menu has a \"gourmet\" hotdog section or you can order and a plain hotdog and pay for additional toppings. Overall a little pricey. The setup was very appealing and inviting."}
{"text":"It is great to see a local business (it is locally owned). The service was outstanding, and you could constantly hear them talk about cleaning, and making every experience outstanding. The trash cans were great, an old time gas pump converted to trash cans. They are still working out the kinks, but the food was great, The hot dogs are definitely the best in the Indian Trail area, the french fries are cut on site and were outstanding. The hot dogs are foot long, and they even have a Bacon wrapped hot dog. What a great idea. The place is small, but the atmosphere is very cozy and the employees were very friendly. Great to see a service industry idea actually providing service. Everything is made to order, so this is not fast food, but worth the wait. We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"This was by far the best hotdog I ever ate. It was wrapped in bacon and covered with 
blue cheese coleslaw with a little mustard and jalape√±o peppers on a large toasted bun. I will definitely be back to try other dogs. The combo came with onion rings and a drink for only about $6.00. What a great value. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. The restaurant was busy but still very clean. I was impressed!"}
{"text":"After hearing of a unique hotdog stand in Indian Trail, I found myself on Hwy. 74 and thought i'd give it a try. 
As I walked through the door i was greeted by a \" WELCOME TO D-MOE'S !\" Reminiscent of CI CI'S pizza. The Two Girls that were at the counter couldn't be any better. Friendly and with  great personalities. I asked a few questions about their hot dogs and they were very knowlegable. I was told by another that they use Duke mayonaise in their homemade cole slaw. I was looking forward to that! 
I ordered the Carolina Dog combo. This includes hand cut fries and drink.
Well-- After a little wait I received my Carolina Dog ( mustard,homemade cole slaw, homemade chili and onions). I went to the table and stool with my order and almost had to jump up on the stool. I'm 5' 51/2\", not tall just hungry.
Now- The dog was long, thin, well done. It did have a good snap to the casing and had a nice taste. The chili was TOO spicey. It was a bit HOT ! I don't think that the average person will expect a spicey chili on a dog. At least, D-MOE'S should advertise this. Next, I found that the cole slaw was homemade. The cabbage was a bit chopped too fine. The Dukes mayonaise was almost non existent. The fries were fresh and hot.
And while I'm at it, they use alot of styrofoam containers; not good.
Service was excellent!!!!! Decor was fantastic! Nice restaurant, just needs fine tuning. I hope they can stay open."}
{"text":"Too Pricey!!

I would have given a higher rating if the quality of the  food justified the price you pay."}
{"text":"My husband and I just ordered D-Moe's to bring home for lunch, and we were pleasantly surprised.  Based on the other reviews on Yelp of this place, our expectations were low...

Yelpers, seriously.  What were you expecting?  It's a hotdog joint located in a former Domino's in Indian Trail.  I'm glad something other than another \"New York Style\" pizza place went into that space.  Based on where it's located (in fast-food alley), you surely can't expect fine-dining.  

But enough about that, and on to the food.  Our hotdogs were good.  I got the Boston and my husband got the Kansas City.  Yes, the dogs were longer than the buns.  No, that's not a problem.  They didn't skimp on the condiments, and everything was fresh and tasty.  The onion rings were crispy and fresh, and the handcut fries were good as well.  We were hoping for shoestring friends...but it looks like we're the only people on the planet that like those?  The milkshakes were hand-dipped and delicious.  

The space is small, but it's clean and well-decorated.  We don't have kids, but there were a few families there and the kids seemed to love it.  There's outdoor seating for when it's not the middle of January.  All the staff were efficient, friendly, and professional.  They seemed to genuinely want everyone to have a good experience.

At the end of the day, D-Moe's advertises good hotdogs in a fun atmosphere.  I think they did pretty well and that they're a decent alternative to the fast-food chains that inhabit the rest of the street."}
{"text":"We were sorta excited for a good hot dog place so when it opened we tried it. We got 4 of the hot dogs i think they were the boston dogs. we also ordered 2 fries and 2 spicy chicken sandwiches. What a HUGE letdown....The hotdogs tasted like they were really old they were so dried out and wrinkly from sitting on the burner for probably hours on end. The fries were these tiny tasteless little things that were soo cold from sitting around. The chicken looked pretty overfried and tasteless. The only thing half way good was the shake. The sign said fresh lemonade but it was awfullll. Sorry D'Moes but you get a negative 10 from us, Worst Ever"}
{"text":"Ran into this place, hiding in the out lot of a strip mill, in Indian Trail, North Carolina.
This is a brand new building, but I didn't inquire if they were at another location previously, or why the hot dogs were famous.

They have a wide variety of 'specialties', which are D-Moe's take on the various regional dogs of the US, like the \"Arizona\", (bacon wrapped, pintos, jalapenos, mayo, onions, tomato, mustard and cheese), the \"Carolina\", chili, mustard, onions, and slaw, the \"Chicago\", and you know what that's all about, and the \"Coney\", which is mustard, beef chili, and diced onions.  I chose the Coney, and chased it down with a local soda pop, \"Cheerwine.\" 

I wasn't too moved by D-Moe's chili, so I peeled out the dog to try it all by its lonesome.  It's a good quality all-beef dog, and it was a-ok.

\"Moe's Original\" seems to be the big daddy of the lot, a bacon-wrapped dog, D-Moe's mustard sauce, Texas Pete, onion, jalapeno, and D-Moe's blue cheese slaw.  I maybe should have gone for that.

As I was just \"tasting\", I didn't try the sides, fries, sweet tater fries, rings, mac and cheese, a couple of slaws.

D-Moe's also has a pretty fair-sized burger menu, and a couple of sandwiches, and damn, looking at the menu just now, I spotted fried bologna, wish I would have seen that on the spot, that would have been my choice for sure.

As for \"Cheerwine\",  the only thing it did for me was make me whine that it didn't make me cheery.  Think of red 7-Up.

I'm a big support of local businesses, no matter where I am, and you should be too.  So when you're in this part of the world, hit up D-Moe's for at least one meal."}
{"text":"It was with great anticipation that I looked forward to the dogs at D-Moe's, as for whatever the reason, there are painfully few places that specialize in hot dogs these days, or at least since the closest Wienerschnitzel is in Texas, there aren't a bunch of options out in this neck of the woods.

So we pulled up, and promptly determined that there were not a lot of places to park. But we figured it out. And then found that there was not a lot of room inside, either. They were packed. So we dutifully scanned the menu board, and there were some interesting combinations. I decided that the D-Moe's dog would do nicely - bacon, mustard sauce, onion, jalapenos, blue cheese coleslaw, Texas Pete. With a side of mac and cheese.

The next issue is that this join is small. Sure, they have a patio outside, but in the middle of December, that seating just doesn't work that well. So the half dozen stools around the bars doesn't help much, and dogs don't travel well. Luckily, someone split as we were done ordering. A bit later, the dogs arrived.

My impression was much like that of others - the dog did not fit the bun. Wasn't even close. Now it doesn't have to be exact, but it would nice if it was almost a match. As it is now, the dog is almost twice as long - and that means that the toppings sit on the bun, and you get lots of dog without toppings. Feel a little cheated, you know? Speaking of those toppings, there is so much going on that you taste some here and there, but mostly they compete with each other. Since this is the special (named after the place itself), it really didn't work. At least the bacon wasn't limp, which I had heard.

Unfortunately, the side (that mac and cheese) wasn't much - maybe three sporks worth. Since the side with the dog saved a good bit (rather than buying a side on its own), it wasn't bad, but that side really wasn't worth the effort.

Almost forgot - looking for the trash? Try the gas pumps."}
{"text":"Driving around  Indian Trail in my post-thanksgiving hangover and I noticed an open sign outside of D-Moe's.  This place had been the local Domino's restaurant, closed, and now a hot dog stand.  They were still working out the kinks but from what I experienced, this place should be a hit.  The restaurant looks like an old gas station with Gulf fuel pumps as trash cans and lots of metal sign graffiti on the walls.  Inside, there is a small place to sit with high top tables, another gas pump and that's about it.  The servers and chefs yell out \"Welcome to D-Moes!\" kinda like they do at that other Moe's.  On a warm day, the covered patio will be the place to be.  

They have various combinations of hot dogs and burgers.  Probably the standout for me was the sweet potato fries which were sweet on their own - unlike some restaurants that have to serve theirs with butter to make them edible.  I really want to go back and try their desserts which include shakes and a moon pie.  The hot dog was good with the chili a little salty for me but that's probably just right for everyone else.  

It's good to see some variety in the Indian Trail food landscape.  I hope this takes off"}
{"text":"Well they listened to everyone's complaints.  Good bye foot long dogs, hello dogs that fit the bun.  My Cincinnati dog was forgettable.  Chilli tasted canned and the dog was unremarkable.  Definitely not impressed.  The staff did not seem organized at all.  Love to support local business but with quality and service like this and with cookout across the street we probably will not be back."}
{"text":"Had the Chicago dog. It was terrible. It was crunchy due to the amount of salt.

I got my son a Octopus dog. WHAT THE HECK IS THAT THING?!
It literally scared my wife when she opened the box. My son wouldn't touch it. 

And why must the hotdog hang off the bun a foot on each side? Makes me feel extremely uncomfortable eating it. Like people are staring at me. 
My wife cut the ends off and threw it in the kids box for the octopus to eat. 

Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Super cool staff, super cool atmosphere, awkward location off 74.  I ordered 3 dogs, one with chili and cheese, one Carolina style, and the last I forget.  The food was very forgettable.  The toppings on all dogs were very sparse and very tasteless.  The little dab of chili was blandly sweet-ish and tasteless....reminded me of Sloppy Joe mix, not like a true coney sauce.  The buns were gross and not steamed which would taste waaaay better.  They also weren't properly sized for the dogs.  The fries were awesome however.  This place desperately wants to be the \"Fuel Pizza\" of hotdogs but their taste is just not on par with a number of established places in town....even some greasy spoon hotdog places.  I hope they've ironed out the kinks, I will definitely try them one more time before writing them off completely."}
{"text":"I was very excited to see a hotdog/burger joint open up in the area. The decor is much like ... a hot dog joint's typical nostalgic decor.  We tried to go on a Sunday for dinner but they were closed, so we went today (Tuesday) for lunch.   

I didn't see any reviews on the burgers so I thought I would order the burgers just for this review.  The first thing that came to mind was that it was different and interesting.  Burger buns shaped like a hot dog bun or hoagie?   Mmmmkay....I lift the hood to see what's under it, and find that the burger patty is thin and the jalapenos are jarred. We also ordered 2 large fresh cut fries which I was very much looking forward to but disappointed to see small shoestring fries (which I don't quite care for, but at least they were fresh cut).  I was also disappointed that the large order of fries was more like a small or medium fry - maybe they gave us the wrong size?  Last but not least, the drinks were all ice so we didn't have much to wash down our food with.  

Overall this place isn't bad, but definitely not the best I have had.  I read the other reviews about the hotdogs, so I will definitely have to try the dogs one day. I'm curious what brand of hot dogs are used because I didn't see it advertised on their website or around the buliding.  I am glad there is a hot dog place nearby, but I am not sure if I would be a frequent customer. For burgers and fries, I still prefer to make the hike to Five Guys since it's still the best I have found within 20 minutes of our subdivision.  I'll update my review when I go for their dogs."}
