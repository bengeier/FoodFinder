{"text":"The food is fresh and so delicious. One of the best location for Asian food in Laval."}
{"text":"By the beard of zeus! - The service here deserve a review. These guys are friendly and super efficient. We took the 'grillade', chicken and beef and I must say, \"it really hits the spot\". Unfortunately the portions aren't too big but that's just me. Im a pig."}
{"text":"Very good soups and appetizers! Fast friendly delivery. The food was very fresh tasting."}
{"text":"I really like this Thai restaurant.....it is close to my house and we have been loyal customers since their opening.  The owner knows us by name all of us, including the four kids! These little details make a difference! They have now moved to a larger location....hoping it will be good for them and that the quality of their food will remain the same excellent thai food that we love....all the best for the future Basilic Vert."}
{"text":"So it was Friday night and my wife and i wanted to stay local. Walked in, nice greet and ambiance. It filled up rather quickly.  Soup was delightful. Spring rolls light, crispy and fresh. Main course was hot and flavorful.  For the price you cannot go wrong. Will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and such kind service! The green curry was delicious! Would come here again!"}
{"text":"J'y suis allée plusieurs fois et je crois que le basilic vert est un incontournable resto thaï à Laval. C'était la première fois que je prenais la soupe tom yum. Quoique un peu trop épicée à mon goût, le mélange de saveurs était très bon. J'ai aussi pris les rouleaux au poulet qui étaient délicieux et le poulet satay qui n'était pas assez assaisonné, mais avec la petite sauce aux arachides qui l'accompagnait, c'était un peu mieux. La plupart du temps, je prends le plat Ga Hot Dieu qui est un plat de poulet avec noix de cajou et légumes. Simple, mais super bon! Le Phram Ram est aussi à essayer si vous aimez le classique poulet aux arachides et épinards sautés. Vous comprendrez que je suis plus poulet que boeuf, mais les plats cuisinés avec ce dernier sont tout aussi délicieux. Les prix sont raisonnables et le service est courtois et rapide."}
{"text":"Great Thai place. The soups are meant for one person but the dishes are generous and very filling. The green and red curries are good. They also deliver and are great for takeout. The Beef Red Curry is probably their best dish along with the salmon. I tried the chicken with cashew nuts stew which is exactly like the green curry."}
{"text":"I came to Le Basilic Vert for lunch with my coworkers. Walking it I quickly found the relatively modern and pretty though it needs to be better maintained (Outside walls had holes, aquarium didn't seem to have been cleaning inside and out for some time, the floors were dirty). The resto was pretty busy which led to some considerable wait time but I was encouraged that this many patrons being here would lead to a quality meal due to its popularity.  I went with their Pad Thai ($15) which came with a soup and roll. The soup was good, the roll was thin & crunchy... just right. The Pad Thai was good but I'll admit I've had far better. The coworker who ordered the same meal as me all felt the same. I would probably bet there are better choices on the menu.  My experience was a 3.5 but rounded down. Will come back and try something else and get this can get bumped to a more respectable 4. Maybe by then the place will be cleaned better."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Thai Basilic now for over a year now. There Grilled mix plate is amazing, especially the shrimps and beef. The Papaya Salad is a killer. If your a big eater like I am order extra and the portions are a little small compared to other places, but the quality is excellent."}
{"text":"In terms of authentic thai food in Montreal coming from someone who has spent a significant amount of time in Thailand, I would have to say this tops the list.  Tom Kha - delicious, might need to mention youd like it spicy if thats what you look for  Green Curry - not the most authentic one ive seen to date, but for Montreal, its as good as youll get"}
{"text":"Been going for years. I adore the food and the staff is awesome. It's healthy its fresh its awesome. A must to visit!"}
{"text":"Nice little discovery in Laval. The food and service were great. Portion are perfect. Go for it"}
{"text":"Good Imperial Rolls. Terrible pad Thai. Mushy noodles seemed like they had been sitting there for three days. The red curry beef was just watery beef and vegetables. Super expensive and definitely not worth it. I will not be ordering again."}
