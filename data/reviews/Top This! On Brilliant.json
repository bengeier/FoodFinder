{"text":"Update, tried their salad, wedgie and wings. All are fantastic. Employees are friendly and willing to customize anything if they can. Fast, cheap, delicious, can't get any better for a pizza shop!"}
{"text":"The Best in Aspinwall/Fox Chapel/Blawnox area.  We've ordered 2 or 3 times from this place and have been very happy. I think our favorite was the mediterranean pizza. We will definitely continue to be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Great food, fast delivery and great staff... Favorite pizza and hogies in the area... Great salads too."}
{"text":"I'm glad that pizza makers are getting wise to the excellence of Carb Bliss--those moments in the day where you want to unbutton the top of your jeans & drool while endorphins plug you into euphoria.  That's what i got from the Loaded Mashed Potato pizza: adorned with mashed potatoes, cheddar cheese, & bacon.  The bacon was fresh & crispy, none of that microwaved crud.  This was some Pittsburgh-grade decadence.   Also: BUFFALO CHICKEN ROLL BITES.  Hot sauce with a touch of garlic & sweetness, tender chicken, melty cheesy doughy goodness with house made buttermilk ranch for dippin.  Pittsburgh represent.   The restaurant is state-of-the-art clean & the counter folk are super friendly.  Salads (you gotta have balance somewhere) were made with crisp romaine & mixed greens; three cheers for nutrients in a town where damnable iceberg lettuce seems to reign supreme.  Why eat at major chain pizzerias where the food is full of chemicals & zapped of vitamin content?  Why not support a small local business that cares about standards & taste?  If i'm gonna get a cheesy pizza with an awesome wheat crust, i'm definitely calling Top This!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! I'm new to the area and this was one of the first local places I tried - and I definitely plan to become a regular!  The staff was very friendly on the phone and my order was ready in the 15-20 min promised. The pizza tasted great, especially the crust.  There are a lot of options to totally customize your pizza (along with calzones, salads, etc.) - I elected to get their Buffalo Chicken specialty pizza, and it was amazing.  They have a \"save $8 after 8 visits\" card which will be sure to make frequent trips worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm always curious about new independent sandwich and pizza places around town so I thought I'd take a chance and with a Living Social deal for Top This! On Brilliant.    When I called to place my take out order, I was greeted with friendliness and enthusiasm.  The gentleman who answered (likely one of the owners) was very accomodating and happy to take my order.  I went with a dozen the garlic parm wings and 2 pizzas: classic pepperoni with red sauce and a pie with white sauce and tomatoes.  Upon arriving at Top This!, I was again greeted by guys who clearly love what they do.  It's great to see this in a new small business.  Their love for what they do is baked into every pie.  The wings, too, were above average for a pizza place.    Even though it's a bit out of the way for me, if I'm ever out and about near Aspinwall, I'm going to remember these guys and stop by.  I wish them much success in the future."}
{"text":"We have ordered from Top This! countless times over the last several months (usually Friday nights because that's our \"pizza night\").  The staff is always extremely friendly and efficient.  They build custom orders in 20 minutes on most of our trips.    It is so refreshing to have a pizza place that lets you customize and does not charge you $30 for a pizza because you ask for white sauce instead of red and an extra topping.  I must say, this restaurant has a fantastic concept that keeps us going back for more!    Thus far, we have had their wraps, pizzas, and salads.  We have not once been disappointed with our order!  We have called in rather complicated and extravagant wrap orders, and the staff always makes something great!  My fianc√© loves their Pittsburgh style wrap with steak.  I favor the chef salad and seafood pizza which is awesome with garlic sauce on the side!  I also must mention one particular experience.  I placed a take-out order that was not ready yet when I arrived.  Rather than walk up to the counter with my order and announce that it was ready or make me ask them if it was done, one of the staff carried my order out to me and handed it to me with a smile.  This is only a small gesture, but to me it exemplified pride in one's work and friendliness.     Definitely give these guys a shot!  You won't be disappointed!  I guarantee Vocelli's, Pizza Hut, or Fox's won't build you a pie like these folks (at least not for the price and with fresh ingredients!)!"}
{"text":"There is more to a good place to eat than just the food. The management, the atmosphere, as well as location are key.   First let me start by saying this food is awesome. It's a pleasure to finally have a place to eat in Aspinwall on Brilliant Avenue that you can feel good about. I had the pizza, and salads. The pizza here is VERY GOOD!  On to the other intangibles. Its exciting to see a group of young entrepreneur's in Aspinwall with so much drive, focus, and passion for creating the perfect place to eat in town. Ive sat down with them and just talked. Their energy is contagious!!!  Location, Location, Location! They should be able to do much more than what Fox's had done in the same location. First of all the food is much better! Also I believe there are plans to create a better dine in experience.   Last but least the atmosphere seems to be trending toward that Aspinwall, contemporary, and hip surrounding. They seem to be tinkering with some innovative ways to making the whole experience fun for everyone. Next time you walk in take a look at the wall and ask them what it's all about!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty picky when it comes to pizza and there are only a few places in Pittsburgh that I'll go. The staff is great, the location is on my way home from work, and the pizza is made hot and fresh to order. The staff alone is enough to keep me coming back, but I love the food too.   I personally love the buffalo chicken roll bites. I have yet to have a pizza from here that I don't like. I love their chewy, yet crispy crust and their toppings are pretty tasty as well."}
{"text":"Sadly, this place appears to have gone under :(  They are gone from the GrubHub website, their Facebook page is deactivated, they no longer answer their phones, and the storefront is covered in a large black sheet. Such a shame!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place all the time when I lived in Fox Chapel. The pizza is absolutely amazing (especially the CBR), and the appetizers are pretty good as well.  Everyone that does the delivery is super friendly and they always arrive when they say they will. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the chicken alfredo and chicken strips weren't always consistent. Sometimes the chicken was awesome and other times it was really tough to chew and I'd have to nuke it in the microwave to be able to eat it.  Other than that, such a good place. If you're into ranch dressing, definitely get some with whatever you order- it's sooooo good."}
{"text":"Pizza & More!  Toppings Galore!  Brilliant colored shop with flowers on the tables!  Only 3 tables.  Salads, Appetizers, Wraps, Wedgies, Calzone, Pasta, kids meals; Top This has is all.    30 Toppings!  Get a Flyin' Hawaiian, Veggie, Mash Potato, Seafood or build your own pizza. The possibilities are endless.  Good pizza with a crisp crust that had a nice taste with some seasoning on the bottom.   Sauce was good.  U can order a pizza how you like it or get a specialty?"}
