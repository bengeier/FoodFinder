{"text":"The boyfriend and I tried this Sunday, 4/6/14.   We were there around noon,and we had the place to ourselves.  I went there because I wanted to scope it out before using a gift cert. I got from a reward program. I had the Buckeye, a house specialty that is supposed to have peanut-butter in it, and an Angel food muffin.  The boyfriend had a smoothie and a white chip/cranberry cookie.    I could not eat my muffin and it was swiftly and promptly refunded with much apology.  It was tough, and had the texture of memory foam.   The boyfriends alleged smoothie was a mix from a box blended with ice as he requested dairy free.    His cookie was very hard and my coffee was just sweet, with no discernible peanut-butter flavor.   Some customers had left as we came in and their table went uncleared the entire time we sat there, which left me wondering why I kept smelling pickles, which we think was dressing in dishes on the plates.  The place was so empty that this was not acceptable.  I will think twice before returning to use my gift cert which requires spending $20 to save $!0.    At $5 for a large coffee, shouldn't be too hard."}

{"text":"I always love arabica and so happy a coffee place opened in the falls that actually had some cred to carry it...I swear so many places come and go around here. Interior is styled nicely and wifi is available. My complaint is this-I order an almond milk latte to go and expect a great latte with homemade or at least organic almond milk. No, instead she tells me they have Silk almond milk in the carton and a small is $5. Wtf!? $5 for a small silk carton almond milk latte!!! You have for to be kidding me but before I could get out no thanks she had it poured and to be honest I was running late for the day and needed a coffee. I would rather get my specialty drinks at The Root cafe in Lakewood which is amazing btw and they have homemade daily almond and coconut milk (I can rave and rave about this place) or my local Starbucks and pay $3 for the same drink. If you are a coffee house, do your research and stop using carton milks and I'll gladly pay $5 for a small latte until then I will make one at home. It tasted just like that silk carton milk w coffee...no thanks!  Side note- I did go in before this time and had a chai tea latte which was delish and worth it so I have to say it all isn't bad but that last time makes me not want to frequent since there are just many other amazing coffee shops around."}
