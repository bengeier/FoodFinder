{"text":"I mainly come here for the Mango Raspado with ice cream and lechera. It's so delicious, I love in ahwatukee and this is the nearest place to get my raspado fix and my husband just had the carne asada torta and he said it was really good."}
{"text":"very poor quality food, very bad customer service by the guy at the register, I ask him if I could trade in the \"cocktail de Elote\" cream instead mayo and he tried to charge me a $1.00 for the spoon of cream.. Is he insane??? All the food was already overpriced for what it is, end of my story: never but never going back..."}
{"text":"It's hard to choose from all the things on their menu. I went with the Strawberry Raspado, I remember them being $1. This one was $7!! I thought it was a little pricey but it was worth it. It tasted great and was a pretty big cup. Def going back."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an unsatisfying taste in food and a mediocre service, this is the perfect place for you! If you really want to regret spending 3 bucks order a mangoyada and you'll be successfully displeased (at least thats my opinion)"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. They take forever even if it's not busy. I was the only one there, only ordered a raspado and it took 10 min. This place is also overpriced"}
{"text":"This Is My First Review On Yelp. And Its Not Because I experienced something Magical and God sent that I needed to make an account. I'm excited To Bring to This website My Thoughts and Opinions starting This Year. Ive had a Hard Time with this website and Paying attention to it because of all the close mined people and the Inexperienced. Ahh Yes About Raspados It Was the Last Place Ive been to and It Was a Pleasant Experience. Its located at Arizona Mills Mall Close to Ross Retail store if you don't feel like walking in a circle to find it. Its Is Easy to find with the Number of People waiting in line. but It Was Surprisingly Slow when I took a Mexican date there and Once we Arrived the Place looked Clean the Workers where nice and Patient great customer service with their eye popping Pink Shirts. We Started looking at the Menu witch Was Surprisingly Small for a Mexican Establishment Menu It Was More Comfort Food with their Own Twist to it and Lots of specialty Mexican Drinks. I Asked My date A few questions about the Unfamiliar Mexican Dishes to Remember the Names is far Beyond me I know One of them Was sopas since it stuck. they had bags of Chips mostly that They Added Steak, Hot sauce and cheese to and served in its own bag witch I thought It was Cardiac stopping Delicious. after an Indecisive  Debate I Went for the carne Tostada sandwich. she wasn't that hungry And Decided on the Flour Cheese Quisadilla. I also ordered a Horchata and She Ordered a Jaimaca Juice. They had tables inside. but We sat On the tables they Provided out which was right in the Middle Of Traffic Its Not a romantic or quite spot at all just an FYI. The Food was fast I say 10 minutes. but for some reason the Drinks took longer. the Dishes Looked Fresh as well as the Jalapenos and the Shredded lettuce and veggies on the side. I picked Up the Sandwich and Most of the Stuff inside Fell Out onto the Plate which I thought It Was Annoying Witch My date could tell. She assured me that How Mexicans Eat so I went with that. I picked up the fork and took bites of the sandwich and Bites of the Fallen good stuff. It Was Delicious and comforting It was like good Street Food. the Bread was Good the Meat was okay a little Dry But It moistened up with the delicious sauce they had on it. I finished mine quick wanting more. I asked about her Quisadilla witch she said it was ok and that she could make it better. I tried Her Quisadilla and I believed her It needed Help but It wasn't bad at all. So It Made Me Wonder If they have some menu Dishes that are Mediocre and some were great. Ill Leave that up to you. Ill Visit this Place again and try It out again order something Different. All in all I enjoyed it. And The Horchata was good. I left satisfied not Heavy at all with a Craving to order something else but I knew I wouldn't Finish it since they had Decent Portions; and Its Not That Expensive. Visit Raspados Instead Of the Food Court If you Want something Different. Good spot."}
{"text":"What a dirty place... Everything is like very cheap ingredients and nothing taste good, prices are really high, I really try this place many times just because I was at the mall and every single time was bad, never got better... Over that: a mean guy taking care of the place with no costumer service skills..Great... Guys... U wont see me there anymore..."}
{"text":"I didn't even want to put one star but had to in order to make this comment. Just know the \"Fresas w/ crema \" was missing the CREMA!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service not just once, but always . Last time I am coming. Always have a bad attitude or mess up on my orders. They messed up on my order today, when I specifically said not to add jalapeños on my nachos. When I told him about his mistake he challenge me by saying that, that's not how I asked for them . Then he simple took out the jalapeño with his hand and added way to much cheese. To top it of he left like five jalapeños in my nachos. Overall, they really just don't care about their customers."}
{"text":"Employer's were nice but the food wasn't so good. I got fresas con crema ,They use frozen strawberries instead of fresh ones which doesn't give it a good taste to it. Just not the best place if you want Mexican desserts."}
{"text":"Employees lack engagement and customer service skills.   Today I visited this location to have lunch, the I ordered at taco and I quesadilla and I found a hair in my food, it was an unpleasant surprise.   It's no surprise, people that ring up also prep food and don't wash their hands.   I won't be coming here anymore."}
{"text":"Foods over priced, not the best customer services and this time they forgot to put salsa in my to go order. :("}
{"text":"Was craving a chamoyada and my favorite place Raspados House in phx was closed so decided to try this place and didn't even get to get a chamoyada cause the cashier was very rude. Definitely not giving my money to them, also over priced."}
{"text":"$20 wasted. This is not Mexican food. It's barely food. Also hardly any seating since its a hole in the mall but the seating they do have is broken or dirty.  The pictures of the food are misleading. They are out of half the things on their needlessly gigantic menu."}
{"text":"The worst! The workers are uneducated and have no customer service skills or knowledge! The food is terrible and not to mention expensive. Don't waste your money. If you're looking for real Mexican food/snacks Go to Carreta De Lily instead!!"}
{"text":"Small spot in AZ mills, with tasty antojitos. I recommend the carne asada sopes and barbacoa tacos, delicious! Wash it down with a fruit drink, the watermelon or cantaloupe aguas are great. Also the fresh fruit plates are a healthy tasty snack."}
{"text":"Great place for a bag of tostitos with corn..."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my sopes. My coconut drink was ok, some huge unmanageable chunks of ice. The menu was quite extensive."}
{"text":"If you're Mexican and looking for a junk food fix this is the place to go! I love their chamoyadas but they always leave my mouth feeling like it is on fire. The sopes and tacos are good too (but not authentic). Minus one star because the women were yelling at each other with vulgar language and their are usually children here."}
{"text":"Awful elote and horrible customer service! It was soupy and the corn wasn't even close to being cooked! It had the most pungent and sour taste! It was absolutely awful!"}
{"text":"This tiny cup is what they sold as a Medium. So then how many OZ is your small? This place is horse shit! All sales are final as well..... what's worse is that the owner was the one that sold this as a medium. There is no way in fucking hell that this is a medium. I understand wanting to make money but this is gauging at its best."}
{"text":"One of the local hotspots for authentic, delicious, and quickly-preoared raspados! You can always spot the Raspados Paradise by the sheer amount  of customers and packed tables out front! There is usually always  a line, although it goes by fast. I have been coming to this location for years, and they have never let me down.  Their mangoyada, tostilocos, carne asada nachos, and gorditas are so good! Definitely a great stop for a snack when shopping at the AZ Mills Mall. Check it out!"}
{"text":"In terms of taste, this place is a hit or miss every time. It's always too busy with no sitting room because it's at the mall. The service is always subpar, bordering on rude. I would say overall, very overpriced considering the portion and inconsistency of quality."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Customer Service was ok. Me and my girlfriend both bought something and our cards were both declined. Strange because our accounts are not anywhere near zero. I ended up using my credit card, and that was finally accepted. Later on in the week, I notice both my cards were charged. It was under $10, so I did not call anybody to make a fuss, but it was still really annoying."}
{"text":"Everything looked soooo good so we decided to put our shopping for Hello Kitty aside and grab a bite. I would call it a mistake, the juice drinks were not that tasty and some tasted downright odd, not horrible, just musty? Freezer burn'ish?. The spicy tamarind was just bleh, not even as fresh as the lollipops you get when you donate $.50 into one of those boxes at a restaurant to help the kids.  The elote in a cup wasn't bad though, a bit overpriced. I did want to like it, because I live down the street, but I will try my luck hanging out at the park instead."}
{"text":"Best raspado ever!!!!!! the best raspado I have ever had was at this place! Service was slow but they were super busy. Good portions and amazing flavor!"}
{"text":"Las fresas con cremas no son de verdad, solo son fresas con wipe cream, hellow?? Eso ni en Mexico las haces asi, elote de vaso estava frio, los granos super enteros muy mal serivicion al cliente, lo siento pero esta mejor la carreta de Lily en fiesta mall!"}
{"text":"This place is a good place for something sweet or a small meal. I LOVE nachos, and I usually get that. I either get the carne asada ones or the ones that you eat straight out of the chip bag. They also have great mango with chile and lemon. And good agua frescas. I will contine going here, the place is usually packed and very limited seating situation. I hope they will soon open a bigger establishment out of the mall. Untill then I will continue to go to this location."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall for sure!!! This definitely reminds me of Mexico with the raspados, licuados, and tostitos con queso/jalapeños"}
{"text":"Love the prices and the tacos.  Everytime I go, I always get the any of the tacos.  My favorite is definitely the carne asada, as it has taste and the cabbage compliments it.  My friend and I usually share the nachos too.  They are interesting because they get served in a nacho bag and come with lots of vegetables, cheese or meat.  Depending on what you get.  They are very bad for you, but are full of flavor... and quite salty.  Nonetheless, I still come here not for the mall, just for those tacos!  BTW, the seating is like a mini- cafeteria.  There is few places to sit and the restaurant is super tiny.  They did add some chairs and tables in the front of restaurant in the middle of the mall, but you might have to wait for people to finish their delicious treat."}
