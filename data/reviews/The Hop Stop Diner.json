{"text":"Delicious food and super friendly service. I recommend the Buffalo chicken wrap and they have amazing smoothies. Great price and clean restaurant too."}
{"text":"Their service is friendly, their pancakes are awesome, and the place plays 50's doo wop music."}
{"text":"The place has a very american theme and feel. The service was friendly. It was very clean. The food was very filling and quite delicious. I had the hot pastrami sandwich with fries. The fries were crispy and got, just like I like them. I would dedicatedly recommend this place for an afternoon lunch spot."}
{"text":"Bland bland bland. They serve american favorites but they half a** it. Fries were basic, burger was basic. By basic I mean bland and just... \"eh\". The bacon was so hard I had to pick it out of my mouth because I felt I might chip a tooth."}
{"text":"A very cool place. .. great employees, food, and service this place is very clean and quaint ... I stop here on my morning walks to just enjoy a lil break and good food."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I have ever had, no coffee ready at 10 in the morning, had to wait an hour to get served and watched customers who came in 10 min ago get their breakfast before us. I'd rather eat at jack in the box ."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!!! There was a tall Caucasian male working behind the register. It was 8:05PM. He helped out a guy who walked in two seconds before my 3 year old son and I. The guy at the register didn't even look at me, he just said \"We're closed\" and walked away. All I wanted was a drink to go because my 3 year old was thirsty. Never coming back again!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! First time and we had outstanding service and delicious food. I had the Southwestern Burger and it was nothing short of AMAZING! Probably one of the best burgers I have ever had. Seriously, no joke. The Anaheim chili and the avocado never slipped off my burger. The chipotle mayo was amazing and the burger was so juicy and perfect in every way! The staff was so polite and attended to us so well. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice and had great food and service each time.  Love the decor. .. even the restrooms are filled with that 50s spirit. I also love the old rock n roll that continually pours out.  I haven't had the yummy looking desserts yet. .. but soon I hope."}
{"text":"Went here to grab a bite after viewing the lights at Glendale Glitters last night. I haven't had a burger in years like this one! WOW. Hot. and I do mean hot off the grill. Great 50's and 60's atmosphere, great oldies music in the background, that was loud enough for Cortana to let me know what the song was, but not so loud that you couldn't carry on a conversation. Doesn't get much better than that! If you're ever in Glendale stop in. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Pancakes very large. Should have gotten one instead of two. Bacon was crisp and tasty. Had a selection of half a dozen types of hot tea and chose the English morning.  Waitress and cook friendly and attentive. Orange juice tasted like Tropicana brand. Was invited to stay as long as I wanted. It was a quiet peaceful place to start the day."}
{"text":"Stopped in this whymsical little diner the other day for the first time.  I found it while antique shopping w/ friends.  We stopped and looked at the menu, the waiter stepped outside & kindly invited us to come back.  We did. The service was very prompt & courteyous.  I had a burger w/ thier house made chips.  WONDERFUL!  the chips were cooked to perfection, crispy, golden & had excellent flavor. My friend oppted for the daily special, pot roast w/ potatoes, & was thoroughly impressed.  I would certainley go back."}
{"text":"Two thumbs way up! I was there for free comic book day and even thou it was busy, i got my food quick and i love every bite!!!"}
{"text":"The people working here went above and beyond to make sure our experience was excellent! The food was great! Terrific diner!"}
{"text":"This is my 4th time to stop in at this cool little diner. I always get the burgers, but others in my party have tried other sandwiches as well with great results. They are always really well made with quality ingredients. The sides are awesome too; fries, or home made potato chips, or fresh made macaroni salad. I've tried them all and they're great. Highly recommend you check out this place."}
{"text":"I ordered a black bean burger. It was so soggy and squishy. It fell apart. Half way through, my stomach started hurting. My friend ordered a bacon burger. She didnt have much luck either. In fact, she went to the restroom because it made her so sick she had to vomit. It was very warm in the resteraunt. I would not recommend, and have no plans on going back!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but service is lacking. I have visited twice and both times the servers are slow and don't give you basics like napkins or straws. I came the second time hoping the first time was a fluke but it remained the same and at least one order was wrong. The decor and music are nice."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was wonderful but the food could have been better.  I ordered a side salad and an apple pie. The pie was so undercooked that I doubt it had ever seen an oven. I will never go back here."}
{"text":"Wife and love it here food is always delicious I've had the sourdough burger and the philly and they were on point"}
{"text":"This is still one of my favorite restaurants. I have since moved to Avondale and still eat here once or twice a week. I now always get something from here to take to dinners or party's when I need something. The only time that I don't recommend this place is when there is a special event going on but if you are at event where else would you go? I have remended a lot of people to this place. Breakfast lunch or dinner it's always good. And clean.    Steven Julian"}
{"text":"This Place is AWESOME I have referred DOZENS of people to it knowing that they will be treated well and will be served GREAT food I have never ordered something I did not like  The people are always trying their best and the owner will be checking herself on the welfare of her customers The Atmosph√§re  is to die for  IF YOU have never been there. .....well then you have simply missed out on life .......if you have and did not like it the please give them another chance  It may be that you just did not have a pleasent day it happens  Whatever someone says on here all that I CAN SAY is it is the PLACE TO BE !!!!! Thank you for reading my review"}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time here.  The Southwest burger was super tasty.  I've had similar burgers from more expensive hipster restaurants and this one took the cake. This is definitely on the list to get again. We also had the brownie a la mode. The brownie was huge and fresh.  The restaurant was slow when we went at 8:30pm. The waitress was sweeping and cleaning up."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten several times at this diner since it opened and it just gets better and better ! It has a very retro interior kind of a throwback to the to the 50s or 60s and the food is always good and the service is too ! Had the daily (mon-fri) special today. Shrimp and chips ! I give it 5 stars !!! We love supporting local businesses that give it their ALL !!!"}
{"text":"Good food. HORRIBLE SERVICE! My husband and I went there today and 1st they seated us in the back it seemed like they forgot they had ppl seating in the back. After finally ordering our food and we got our food the waitress left to the bank and NO ONE else that was working there ever checked on us. No beverage refills we were thirsty. The other waitress would just glance at us but never would walk over and see if we needed anything or checked in. My husband and I have given this place plenty of chances but it just seems they need better customer service. Plus it wasn't even busy! They only had 3 tables. That were occupied."}
{"text":"Nope. Went out to lunch with some co-workers and was excited to see that french dip was the special for the day. We easily got a table and placed our order, there was six of us but the lady was polite and go our drinks of quickly. After that everything went down hill..   I ordered a lemonade, which was watery and tasted salty, which was really weird. But concluded it was just some weird powered mix, it was ice cold so I didn't say anything. We sat and waited for about 30 minutes, six sandwiches should not take this long. And only four of our six orders came out, they had forgotten to make two if the orders. Sides were wrong, however, the fries I got instead of a side salad were tasty. And the only good thing about the meal.  The meat was over cooked and had a fried greasy texture to it. The Au Jus was pure oil, it was awful. However, the problem was that the meat was so cold and the bread was so tough I had to dip it but it was one dip for every five bites. There was no cheese or onions or anything else on the sandwich. Worst sandwich ever. I stole fries from my co-worker because it was the only good thing to eat.   The place then got slammed and the staff was over whelmed and disorganized. You could hear them arguing over mislabeled, not labeled, take-out versus eat-in orders. This place is also set-up for people to pay there check at the register, which we thanked our luck as we had to get back to our training. However, they began taking people's orders at the register causing us to wait in line, one couple ahead of us, stood and asked multiple questions about the menu and than sat at a table. Which made us furious as we watch the clock tick by.   After standing in line we raced back to our training arriving late and unsatisfied. Never again."}
{"text":"This is a cute diner.   The food is fresh and homeade.  I had the club excellent... the bread was grilled ,  so crunchy.  I had the chips with the Habanaro ranch to dip chips.  Very good and spicy (a little goes a long way.)   The owner came by to check on use several times.  I also had the chicken Caesar ,  the chicken was so moist.  This is a gem of a restaurant.  Right in downtown Glendale.  You must stop by,  gives you that old time malt shop feeling."}
{"text":"I actually love this place. I used to come on Wednesday for their mac and cheese but they don't have it anymore now it's a open face pot roast sandwich. I do miss the mac and cheese it was amazing the ice cream is good and service has always been great. My favorite family owned business"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very chill and run by young people. I had a salad, my husband had a burger and daughter the breakfast plate. It was all very tasty and they have a lot of desserts. It was a little grimy but that's a diner for you. All in all the staff was super nice and pleasant. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Awesome food. The burgers are great and so is the service. I will definitely be coming back here again. Classic American  Diner experience"}
{"text":"We waited an entire hour and our food never arrived. We watched four other tables, who arrived after us, get their meals and decided enough was enough. The owner came to our table once when we first arrived but only watched our table from afar after that.  After 55 minutes of waiting, we asked our server how much longer our food would take and she replied it should just be a few more minutes. I timed my watch for five minutes and we left.  The food looked and smelled good; unfortunately, we weren't able to sample any!  I did feel sorry for our server as it was her first day and the owner made the mistake of putting her on the floor without knowledge of the menu and without the ability to multi-task. The server was trying and was put in a difficult spot."}
{"text":"I like this place!  Been here for a late night ice cream run & lunch when hanging around downtown Glendale.  Price is as expected & desserts look good.  Everything is made to order so that's a plus too if you're not in a hurry."}
{"text":"Kinda bummed. We made old town Glendale our destination today to shop and find a local joint for lunch.   Stopped here and got a buffalo chicken wrap and chicken tenders that could have come from a QT gas station. Even the French fries were undercooked. The server wasn't interested in providing anything above the minimum amount of service.   We passed at least 6 other places afterwards that were probably better - do yourself a favor and go search them out instead."}
{"text":"Raw French fries, miniature size salads, sandwich almost all lettuce barely any chicken.  My friend said their gravy for biscuits was like flavored water.  Terrible!"}
{"text":"I had a delicious chicken breast and avocado sandwich here with a friend recently. The sandwich was warm and neatly prepared. The fries are also good. Our server was friendly and attentive. However, he took a while to get the check which is a complaint about Hop stop I had received before visiting for the first time. Other than that, the menu is just about the right size (good variety, not too overwhelmingly long). The inside of the diner is neat and welcoming. And the food is great. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I'm VERY impressed! Yes, the food is typical diner fare, but it is VERY good diner fare.  With rare exception, the food is absolutely excellent (skip the banana bread...it's glazed and it shouldn't be). You really can't go wrong with anything here.  The full menu is available at all times, so if you want a big burger for breakfast, you can get it. The ambiance is really charming, and the music is top-notch.  A rare gem in downtown Glendale!"}
{"text":"Great friendly service. Awesome peach cobbler. The chicken salad sandwich was really good on the molasses bread."}
{"text":"I'm giving this  one star because negative stars don't exist. This is the second time we have been there. First time was during Glendale Glitters and it took 20 minutes to get 2 Cokes. This time we went out of about 8 tables 4 were occupied. Took 10 minutes to get the waitress to take a drink order, then after waiting another 10 minutes for her to actually bring it to the table, she said she would be right back. Another couple seated next to us walked in and within 6 minutes she was taking their order.. WHAT? It took 20 minutes just to get 2 drinks to get to our table and she had the nerve to take the order of someone who walked and seated within 6 minutes??? When we said something she acted like a deer in headlights!! Terrible service and I will do everything in my power to discourage anyone from coming there. This girl couldn't serve 2 tables by herself let alone 4!!!"}
{"text":"Do not order burgers to go. Clean establishment with nice service seemingly enough like a old Betty Boop style diner. The meat for the burger itself is ordinary with zero seasoning but greasy. The bottom bun of the burger being brioche turns to a rubber patty absorbing all the grease. Cheeseburger with ketchup was inedible due to flavor and rubbery texture. The southwest burger with BBQ sauce and bacon had enough flavor to get through but the likeness to rubber ultimately caused the burger to be thrown out as well... Fries were  well cooked to crispness with a fluffy inside allowing the two stars."}
{"text":"The Hop Stop is adorable! I love the 50's theme. The service was pretty fast and the server was very nice. I had the spicy grilled cheese which was not bad. My food had clearly been waiting for the other orders to be ready because it was only lukewarm.  I would give 3 stars except the people I was with loved the burgers they had. One thing we all agreed on was the price- my meal was only $5! The desserts look awesome. I  would return if invited but I would not go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"The owner Andrea spent some time with us and talked food (my favorite conversation topic) and on their menu she has the loose meat sandwich \"Maid Rite\" for 5.99 with fries! Great to see awesome foodie items that's not expected in odd places. Now I didn't try it since I went with the T-Bird Special... A Thanksgiving Sandwich and side salad, but bet your bottom dollar, I'm coming back around for this one. Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food!! I had the club sandwich and it was to die for! More than enough meat on the inside and the bread was toasted to perfection. My kids had the cheeseburger and fries and they absolutely loved it. Will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"Cute diner, pretty good food, but the manager (young inexperienced guy) is about the least effective employee I've ever come across. SLOW at everything...taking orders, serving and checking out. Nice but totally unprofessional and quick to blame others.  Sometimes the kitchen under cooks the food and almost always gets in wrong."}
{"text":"This place is SO great. However, recently within the last two months, they have been slacking! I work within walking distance, so I'm there frequently. I order in and take to go. My to go orders are always messed up, replacing ranch with Cesar dressing and including tomatoes when asked not to, and even giving me someone else's order. In the restaurant, I waited 45 minutes to get a freaking salad when only 2 other people were eating. Their worker got his lunch before I got mine and proceeded to eat it at the table next to me. With a little bit of extra effort, the workers here could easily make this restaurant a favorite of mine and other locals like it used to be. It just seems like they don't care."}
{"text":"I went here for my Grandmas 70th birthday party, and the servers were nice, the atmosphere was nice, but the food gave me food poisoning. Everyone who got a burger said they tasted old, and mine tasted like it's been in the deep parts of the fridge from a few years ago. It caused me to get sick, so I have to give it 1 star."}
{"text":"So disappointed I ordered a pastrami Sandwich and potato salad and received this...so mad"}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night- it wasn't crowded which was good. I got the burger with blue cheese and barbecue sauce on pretzel bread. The meat was dry and the taste was just okay. I don't know if I'll be back, but I'll try other items on their menu if I do."}
{"text":"Worst place in downtown Glendale. Prices are sky high, and they routinely over charge on top of that. For example, the menu states $3.60 for a fruit smoothie and then they charge you $4.70 and claim the sign is an error. Plus the smoothies are watered down with just s hint of flavor. This place sucks...avoid and save your money, 7-11 has better stuff."}
{"text":"And Andrea the bipolar owner has continued to ignore her customers    AVOID THIS PLACE   I was truly hoping for a great Buffalo Chicken Wrap BUT the chicken was old. Clearly had been in the fridge a few days and then microwaved to it's death. Could barely bite into it....and the side salad is literally 4 pieces of romaine.   What a joke!   My guess is they screw over and give horrible food to UberEATS customers.   Can't wait to blast them in my Arizona Republic places to avoid article.   Death to Hop Stop. Unemployment is waiting for you"}
{"text":"Good food. Too a bit to get a waiter to come over, but lunch was good. Had a burger and the chicken cordon blue sandwich. There was an error on the bill, but they were friendly and easily took care of it for us. Would recommend for a casual lunch if I'm the area!"}
{"text":"Walked in no greeting asked for a menu guy points at the placed order for breakfast wrap   With sausage took forever .... Wrap had about three pea size sausage nuggets in it .... First time here is last time here."}
{"text":"We got to the restaurant at 1:50 and it took the waitress 10 minutes for her to get our drink order. By 2:05, we had only drinks and waited until 2:18 to even place an order. She told us that we would get our food in 10-15 minutes. It is 2:53 and we still have not yet received our food. Super long wait and understaffed. Very disappointing after waking in expecting great service for how cute the place is. I hope our food is warm when it gets here..."}
{"text":"Good food if you're looking for a burger joint, and fries are amazing. Located in old town Glendale, right across from the park & the library. The only drawback would be that the seating isn't very comfortable(. 3 booths,we ended up at one of the tables)"}
{"text":"The cutest 50's diner around! Friendly and fast service, but I wouldn't even mind if it was slow, because I could sit there for hours and be happy!  Food is so yummy, and will take back to sitting in your moms kitchen! Ooh La La the local fire dept just walked in for dinner! Yes please!!"}
{"text":"Fun little diner, great food, excellent service. Try the chicken salad on nolassis bread.  Chocolate malt was great also."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and it's been the same every time.   The first problem is that they open at 7 during the week but they aren't actually ready to conduct business until 0730 or 0800.  We arrived at 0730 and the kitchen wasn't ready to actually cook food until around 0800 so we sat with our water and coffee for about 30 minutes.    The service is okay.  When I think 50's diner I imagine friendly and energetic staff.  The employees here seem under-prepared, under-trained and too distracted or overwhelmed to be energetic.  I had the pick three breakfast with eggs over-medium, bacon and toast.  The food came out quickly and the eggs were hot but the bacon was cold.  Everything is very greasy and my eggs were over-hard.  The toast appears to be cooked on the flat top rather than toasted in a toaster because it is covered in melted butter, of course it tasted great.  The other people I was with were served cold hash browns and a cold breakfast sandwich.   I have had the breakfast sandwich before which is good, but again, the bread is very greasy with butter.  I have also had the chorizo wrap.  I will agree with another reviewer that it was mostly under-cooked hash browns and the chorizo was bland.    The coffee is great but rarely plentiful and almost never ready at 0730.  I really want this place to succeed because I always like to support small businesses.  The decor is good and they play great music.  The place is always clean as well.  There are just a few things they can do that would really step up their game and not cost much.  Stop serving coffee and drinks in disposable cups.  Most people that sit down to eat want their coffee in a mug   They need to get organized and be ready for customers when they open.  Rather than spending time putting out all their signs and displays they should be attending to customers.    Get energized.  You have an up-beat joint that plays 50's music.  You are young employees and you need to be more energetic.   I feel like when I go here at 0730, the waiters/waitresses have just rolled out of bed.  I have a feeling that this place may be a different experience during lunch so I wouldn't be opposed to giving it another shot later in the day."}
{"text":"Service is good food is horrible taste like bar food or the food u get for free at a motel not worth the money eggs a box eggs biscuits are horrible and chicken fried steak taste gross I could only stomach half my plate came a month back got a chili dog won't ever come here again I tried 2 times and this place is not worth your time or money"}
{"text":"Very good food. I really liked the parmesan crusted bread they used on my sandwich - I could just eat that on its own. My hubby had a burger and said it was good as well. They hand make the chips. They were tasty and crunchy. I had some apple pie which was full of cinnamon. The bottom crust was a little less cooked than I prefer but definitely still edible. They have an Elvis sandwich on the menu fried with peanut butter, banana, honey, and you can add bacon. I need to try this next time for sure!"}
{"text":"Sad excuse for a diner. We went for a quick lunch and many things in our order were messed up including kettle chips being replaced for Lays chips from the bottom of the bag and missing bacon on a BBQ Bacon burger. The club sandwich did not have the classic three pieces of bread so not truly a club sandwich. Their \"specialty\" Parmesan crusted bread is white bread with Kraft Parmesan cheese spread on it. Very strange. The waiter never asked if we needed anything or wanted any refills. When we were paying, two of us wanted to get a to go coffee added to our bills. The waiter was completely confused by what he had to do with the checks and got annoyed with us. The place was run very poorly.  I highly do NOT recommend going to this place go to the Gas Light Inn around the corner instead."}
{"text":"Great food great atmosphere and wonderful staff always satisfied and come here often over the past three years try out their home baked goods"}
{"text":"This is the best grilled cheese is the best sandwich I have ever had in MY LIFE. Their cheese spread perfectly and their pasta salad makes my mouth water just thinking about it. My boyfriend had their turkey avocado and it was amazing he said he would come just for their onion rings alone. This place is fabulous. You must go here their staff is so friendly..."}
{"text":"To be honest, I was actually headed to Bitzee Mama's for lunch only because I went there as a child when I lived in Phoenix, and now that I am down visiting, I thought it would be nice to go back. However, I had forgotten they close at 2. It was 1:56 when we arrived and I wasnt about to piss off the cooks. So down the way I saw The Hop. Its a small, very cute little diner. The prices are right and I tried the Philly special. Wow ! Done perfectly. The fries were delicious, and wouldnt you know, the chef came out and asked everyone in the diner if everything was good. What a pleasant surprise. A very young man with a great talent. Yes, I would eat here again. The service and food was extraordinary."}
{"text":"I was not very impressed with the Hop Stop Diner.  It was quite noisy and there was not one place available to sit.  The food was very sub par."}
{"text":"This is an awesome little diner with great fresh food! Definitely worth coming here if you're ever in the area."}
{"text":"Went in on a tues night to get some deserts with my fam, there was only one girl in the front running the cashier and taking table orders. We werent acknowledge Until about 10min after and thats when we got seated(we have a 4 and a 6 year old so we wanted to sit while eating the ice cream or whatever desert we decided on) we sat, decided what we wanted and after awhile she told us shell be right with us, waited for another 20 min and nothing. We ended up just leaving. Very disappointed. Bad experience."}
{"text":"I personally have eaten at the hop stop dinner more time then I can count and have never had a bad experience. First off the inside is amazing looking. I love all the old coke signs and d√©cor. As soon as you go in you are greeted and sat, after that one of the waiters/waitresses will get u a drink (I recommend the iced tea) and then take your order. Their menu is big and has everything from good deli sandwiches to hamburgers. They have daily specials Monday thru Friday that you cant go wrong with if you cant decide on something, I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for good, quality food for a great price."}
{"text":"I'm a picky eater, I admit it...always have been.  I was such a scrawny tomboy of a kid, that out of exasperation, my mother finally relented and let me eat peanut butter sandwiches... Lots of peanut butter sandwiches.  As an adult, a proper grown up version of the peanut butter sandwich is pretty hard to come by...but not at The Hop Stop Diner, AKA Krispy Creations.  My favorite sandwich, the Elvis, is a grilled peanut butter sandwich with bananas and honey.  It makes my tastebuds, and my heart sing!  The BLT, grilled cheese, and pulled pork are also pretty amazing sandwiches, as are the gourmet coffees, cookies, and pies.  The decor is super cute and clean, complete with jukebox era tunes, just like a 1950s soda shop (and the owner is as adorable as the surroundings).  This place just has it all and is my new favorite spot for some comfort food that transports me right back to the warm fuzzies of childhood."}
{"text":"Loved it!!! Food is absolutely delicious, coffee was super good. I had scrambled eggs, with hash browns and French toast, it was so good!!! But someone in my group had a burger and that was very enticing. Everything is well made! It's clean! Ariel was our server and she was so sweet and very helpful!  I loved it, definitely tempted to come back every other day!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place!  We come to this area a lot but never saw the Hop Stop Diner before. Love the decorations and Betty Boop  Food was good!  Classic, easy, and super fresh diner food. Whole family was happy and full after dinner. Kids had burgers, Hubby and I had sandwiches. Fries and homemade potato chips were yummy too. I love how fresh it all was! We got milkshakes (such a good price!!), they were also very fresh and delicious.  We got a chance to talk to the owner....very nice gal. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today for lunch.  Had the pastrami on rye and the pastrami was very lean!!  The homemade potato chips were tasty.  My husband had the southwestern turkey burger with double meat and he said it had a nice flavor.   For dessert we tried the coconut cake, which was to die for!!  We brought half of it home. We found the wait staff friendly.  Would highly recommend this place.  There is something for everyone there.  They are open for breakfast too."}
{"text":"We were there for Glendale Glitters. Stopped in and got cupcakes. They were only $1.80 and really good. It was super busy and my burger order was messed up. No biggie. Very busy night."}
{"text":"Good food. It was difficult ordering for some of the people in my party. I wish they made things easier for people with dietary restrictions to order. Although the food was good and the staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Fabulous little \"50\" style diner in the historic Glendale district! The kids and I enjoyed burgers, chicken tenders, fat French fries and good ol fashion milkshakes that were second to none. The atmosphere was classic and fun featuring old fashion Coke a cola decor with a bit of Betty Boop. Bravo to the owners and staff! We loved the individuality of the place."}
{"text":"Slow for a sunday when no one else was around. Burgers were over cooked. Asked the server before how they were cooked. \" well done, but they are still juicy\". No had to dunk in sauce to eat. They did have a clean place and large booths. Needless to say, i will eat somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"We come here regularly, the food is good old American and Ariel is awesome waitress however the new guy manager is terrible with service always to busy chatting to wait on customers and won't take your order if you sit in patio! Spoke to the owner today hopefully the situation is resolved because I love this place it's homey fun and the food is good"}
{"text":"Built my own burger, it was good but it was over seasoned which didn't let me enjoy it fully and my lettuce was soggy so I had to take it out. The fries were good though. If I were to come back here again I probably wouldn't right away but my experience was only ok."}
{"text":"Cute place but very noisy. Server was prompt and was plrssant. I ordered the southwest burger with fries which took almost 30 minutes to arrive even though there was only 1 other person in the restaurant. A pleasant surprise was the burger was very good with a large slice of roasted green chili, avacado, jack cheese over a fresh handmade beef patty. I might try again but I will call in my order to cover the long wait."}
{"text":"Adorable decor 50s inspired with the cutest Betty Boop statues! I try to support local businesses and this is not a chain big plus. Waitresses are adorable and friendly. Food is cooked to order with fresh ingredients. Good selection of diner food and serves breakfast too! I will be coming back for the desserts next time! Yummy"}
{"text":"Cute place! Had the Chicken Bacon Avocado Wrap with Fries. Good size portion and so yummy. They willing exchanged the cheese from cheddar to pepper jack.  Convenient location. Would definitely go back! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Cute place. Nothing fancy. Clean. Good food. Good prices. Staff very attentive and the owner is really personable. You can hang if you want. We were just passing through Glendale on a hot day at lunch time. Would stop on again when in the nabe."}
{"text":"Food was bad, bland, overcooked. They didn't even have change for a hundred I'm guessing the manager makes them use their own money because they don't have a register. I would give it 0 stars if I could. Seriously, who doesn't have change or a register. Who manages this place??"}
{"text":"Great experience! Fast, tasty, and exactly what I expected it to be. Got the bacon burger on sourdough. Bomb! I came in so hungry I had to add an extra patty. SO WORTH IT! The burger was great, but I think I would cone in just for the onion rings. Molly was my server, she was pleasant and attentive. During my visit I had a chance to chat with Andrea and she seemed sincere.  Me also being in the restaurant business we could relate about many things. I appreciate her taking the time to chat with me, as I have never been in before. I will definitely be back. Thank you Hop stop, and thank you Andrea. Keep up the good work! :-)"}
{"text":"Came here today on a non-busy Saturday afternoon. My boyfriend ordered a burger and a water, and patiently waited for over 20 minutes for said order. Meanwhile, the staff ignored him and was not even polite enough to supply the water as they graciously fooled around in the back. Finally after 30 minutes, my boyfriend asked the manager for a refund. The manager did not provide the refund or the food!! We have never experienced such horrible customer service and management and would never recommend this to anyone. We're disgusted at the customer service- Yelpers please stay away!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went here for the first time today. Great food, fun atmosphere, terrific service. All in all a great experience. Support local small businesses like The Hop Stop Diner."}
{"text":"The service was great. Nothing special but that's how I like it. I don't like places to make a huge fuss when you first walk in. We ordered burgers and it was so yummy even the fries were great.  Staff was friendly and the environment was fun and inviting."}
{"text":"Save your money. Neat lil diner, very bland tasting food. Ordered buffalo chicken wrap, might of well been a salad with a couple pieces of chicken in a tortilla. Wife had the chicken bacon avocado wrap... same thing. Kids had the chicken tenders, could have bought a whole box of chicken tenders and nuked them and they probably would have had more flavor. Even the fries had zero flavor. Bottom line, overpriced and under delivered on all aspects."}
{"text":"This may be a local diner, but i was not satisfied with my meal. first - the good news is, they're friendly. Second - the hot dog lacked \"pizazz\". It was mainly bread and hot dog was ordinary. Third - although fresh does were served, the portion size was small. Overall, it was okay. This probably wouldn't be my first choice of restaurant..."}
{"text":"Really good. We stopped for a quick bit. The spacey grilled cheese sandwich is excellent. My husband had the crispy chicken sandwich which he said was excellent. Will definitely stop in again as the device was very good also. Cool diner environment with 50's music."}
{"text":"We went to this place during a really busy day, The Chocolate Festival was going on. The waitress said we could sit outside in the back if we wanted and what a treat that was. It was quaint and perfect for us. I wish I could have gotten the lady's name but I didn't, she had long brown hair with some tats. She was a fabulous waitress and full of personality. She made our experience there even better. When asked if they had cherry coke, she said she could make one up. The ice tea I had was really good and fresh tasting.  The food was fresh and good. We all had something different and we all agreed it all tasted good. For those of you who want or need gluten free, they even have gluten free bread. Nice touch. The pasta salad was great.   Even though it was a really busy time, we were seated and served in a timely manner.   For the record, the restroom was extremely clean and to me that is a plus. The waitstaff were on top of everything."}
{"text":"After waiting 30 minutes for a burger received it and it was cold very disappointing. Almost $8 for a burger and fries portion size of extremely small burger"}
{"text":"First time here was a good experience.  Love the decor and atmosphere at this place! Looks like a 50s style diner.  My wife and I both ordered burgers: a patty melt and a Southwest burger. Both were delicious and filling! The burgers were a good size and have a good flavor. The bread and buns used were also really tasty and the burgers were stacked high with condiments.  I ordered onion rings with my burger and they came out over done the first time. I told the server and she immediately fixed it, thankfully. The second batch of rings looked and tasted much better but were still a little heavy for me.  The server and owner were very friendly and took the time to recognize it was our first time here and made us feel appreciated which, unfortunately, doesn't happen too often these days when the market is oversaturated with so many restaurants. We plan on coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I averaged out on this review. 2 and a half stars.  4 for the theme especially if you like Coke memorabilia and 50's music.  1- the place was filthy. My shoes were sticking to the floor. The walls are dirty and dingy, and the tables were never cleaned while I was there. Maybe a paint job will help?  4- Aloha burger was good  1- Homemade chips tasted like fish- Blah! (oil?)  2- Price -9 dollars for a burger and chips. No thanks. I can spend that type of money at another burger place that is known for great burgers.  Also, this place uses take out cups for eat in drink orders. That must generate a lot of trash. I have an issue with this for sure. Maybe just a fluke today or do they always do this?"}
{"text":"This place could easily get 4 or 5 stars. But they need to make some changes.  We went to Glendale glitters and had planned on eating at another restaurant. It was Monday and they were closed?????  The Hop Stop was just up the street so we landed in their shop.  The place is decorated in a 50's 60's soda fountain style. Quite appealing to me. They have burger, pastries, ice cream. Many other items that should be easy to make quickly.  They were not crowded as it was early. We ordered our drinks from a very energetic waiter. He had our drinks to the table quickly and took our order. I think we got two hamburgers, a hot dog for the children we had with us and a sandwich. Then we waited and waited. More than 20 min passed before we started to get our food and then there was still a wait of 5 to 10 min before everything had been delivered. Not just our table but everyone that was there had a long wait. Not sure what was causing this as there was 4 or 5 people behind the counter.  I would definitely eat there more often when in Glendale if they could fix the long waits. I will give then another try when in the area.  If you are not in a hurry the food is good and the decoration of the place is appealing."}
