{"text":"I want to try out this new Malaysian restaurant after going to Restoran Malaysia and Truly Thai.  When I first walk in, the decor gives me a feeling that it is not an Asian restaurant but a western style restaurant.  It has a trendy and modern look.

As usual I order the hot tea that is filter through a cloth that I forgot the name.  It costs CAD$5 a cup that is pretty expensive.  Then we order a Chicken rice and Curry Chicken Roti.  The Chicken rice has nothing special.  I should order the HaiNang Chicken.  The Roti is good.  It is not better than Restoran Malaysian but is good enough.

The service is very good.  There is a separate partition in the restaurant with a bar area.  We are thinking about having a small party there that can host about 50 to 70 people.  Overall, it is a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"This is Restoran Malaysia's more expensive, more chic, and newly opened younger cousin. I planned on dining at Restoran Malaysia but a sign was posted there saying \"Closed on Mondays, please visit Villa Malasyia\" instead and that's exactly what we did.

Very nice interior, very spacious but if anyone's read my review on Restoran Malaysia and how I much it hurt to pay 5x more compared to the real deal and not taste as good, this place was even more expensive and will therefore get a lower review. 

As I was going thru the menu, I felt uneasy seeing that the average price for a section labelled \"Street Food\" was 16$. Good thing it was lunchtime and they had a similar lunch menu for some same items at 10$. The food was good (as good as RM), but cmon! Who labels a menu section street food and charges 7 to 8x more as compared to the authentic version.

With the exception of the interior and parking options, Restoran Malaysia beats this place in food selection (if the RM menu has 10 pages, this place has 3 pages), prices, and better service. I'm pretty sure that covers everything I look for in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday recently and was surprised it was not fully packed as w/ other restaurants in the surrounding area. 

The decor at Villa Malaysia is trendier & service was equally good in comparison to their sister restaurant Restoran Malaysia. 

We ordered the Noya Platter as we couldn't decide which appetizers we wanted. I think next time we'll def. order the Top Hat as is. The rest were good too but nothing that special. I absolutely adored the Kampung Fried Rice. It's a chicken shrimp fried rice with eggs and veggies...w/ a lil bit of spice. YUMMM ^^ 

My friends found this place rather spicy. They had ordered Roti Canai & smth else. But found the roti extremely spicy even though they'd wanted it very mild. They had to order a fruit juice as it was just burning....:(

My fiance ordered a drink here... I wish I remembered the name. But imho it was NASTY... it reminds me of that aussie brand handcream Jurlique. I'd want it on my hands not as a drink. Thank u ^^

Would def. come back again! This is closer to me than R.M"}
{"text":"Villa Malaysia has completely changed their menu since the last time I visited. So time for me to do an update. 

I guess they realized they were pricing themselves out of the market, now the prices and selections are much more in line with their sister Restaurant Restoran Malaysia and even cheaper... 

Most of the selections now comes with Rice or Roti... and they are great if you are dining alone..most of them are priced under $10. And there are a lot more non Spicy items on the menu compare to before 

Basil Beef ($9) 
- Rich tasting sauce... Beef was quite tender.. 
- I like the deep fried lotus root that used as garnish 

Sambal Fish ($9) 
- Really really spicy... my boyfriend was choking and turning red just have one piece!! 
- Fish was lightly battered and deep fried finished off with spicy sambal sauce with nicely cooked tomato... 

Lacy Mango Ice Cream ($6) 
- Great portion to share... not bad but doesn't wow me.... 
- Mango ice cream wrap in crepes which is quite light.. and good touch with the fresh mango bits 

Teh Tarik ($5) 
- Really good milk tea, but $5?!! And a small cup.... 
- Smooth and Silky... not too sweet with a hint of spice 
- $5?! 

The atmosphere of Villa Malaysia is so different after they revamped their menu. Family and people of all ages filled the restaurant. 

The service though was excellent, our waiter even asked me if my Sambal Fish is spicy enough and if I need hot sauce... and gave us new glass of fresh ice water without requesting! 

They still have not get their liquor license..but seems like they realized Villa Malaysia will never be a cool Lounge.. they might never going to serve any cocktails here!"}
{"text":"After my friend's baptism, we were deciding about where we should go for lunch.  A friend amongst the group mentioned Villa Malaysia but no one was sure if it was any good.  It appeared to be relatively new and the decor has been described as way too nice for the typical Asian restaurant that many Torontonians have grown accustom to.  We decided to check it out.

Upon entry it was exactly as described, the decor was nice.  The restaurant was quite big with a full bar surrounded by flat screens.  This was perfect as being sport enthusiast, the raptors game was on.  If you go for lunch hours, there's this new tapa style all you can eat lunch menu.  The variety is good and at $18 a pop, a little expensive for a lunch buffet but we were all way too intrigued and wanted to try it out.  

Once the waiter arrived, we said one of everything on the menu please.  This included all Starters, all Street Eats, 1 mango salad and 1 green salad (LOL, I know we're horrible), all Land and Sea and all Desserts.  We ordered our drinks and waited for our huge feast to arrive.  It didn't take too long for the first set of food to come.  The large number of starters came out in about 15 mins.  And we were starting to get a little worried as they gave us 2 of each on the starter's menu, yikes.  So we ploughed through and from the starters, Satay Chicken and Beef came out as clear favourites.  We almost wanted to ordered more even though we were way over our heads.  

From Street Eats, we tried to compliment our meaty choices with some coconut rice (which was disappointing) and roti.  From Street Eats the only thing that I would kinda consider a winner would be the Malaysia Fried Chicken which was fried crispy and had a juicy tender center as you ate into it.  From Land and Sea, the Banana Leaf Wrap Salmon and Coconut Tilapia were deemed the winners.  The Salmon was nice and the Tilapia was a little different with the coconut but definitely a welcomed difference.  What were a little disappointing were the curries.  Across the board they appeared to be a little watery and didn't pack a nice flavour to them.  The texture wasn't at all rich and the overall dish appeared to be rushed.

After sitting for about an hour and a half, we pushed onto the final portion of the menu, dessert.  We all looked worn out and sleepiness was starting to settle.  We managed to almost try everything except for the coconut mousse.  Now if you're coming from an Asian background, Pearl of the East is essentially the small white tapioca that is found in many Chinese soup desserts.  It was a cold dessert with a coconut base.  And best ice cream on the menu would probably be the French vanilla ice cream.  It was quite nice and rich.  After this point it was officially game over for the group.

Overall, I'm mixed on Villa Malaysia.  On a whole, the food was good but I felt there were far too many misses.  And on a menu that extensive, really nailing 3-4 out of 10, is that a great mark?  I'm not sure.  If you're a loyal customer and know what you want, then agreed Villa Malaysia is a good choice.  But if you're wandering into the restaurant, there's just far too many potential misses for you to decide, 'I'm not coming back'.  Do note though, the service was great and that's why I'm mixed on Villa Malaysia, overall 3/5... is that a great mark?  I'll let you decide."}
