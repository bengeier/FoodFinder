{"text":"Food was amazing, the flavors of their grilled chicken and lamp is amazing. I ordered the iskander kabab which was delicious and the mix gril was also so good. They have a very small space and don't take reservations so give your self so time for waiting on weekends.  The service was not that great but I understand because it's a small and always busy."}
{"text":"Me and my brother were looking for a place to eat and we stumbled accross this place by accident.  It's a very small restaurant and normally (yes, I've gone back) packed with people.  A true indicator that the food is good. Nothing fancy about this place and zero decore, it's really a take out place tbh that just happens to have tables.    The food is cooked over coal so it gives the kebab's a nice taste.  The portions are very large and the price ranges from 10-20.  It's a unique experience if you're looking for kebab's that have a smoked coal taste to it.  Very good food!"}
{"text":"I come into Kebab 49 for a small oven pizza to go. Many people come in after me, were served and left before me. I stand up from my seat to look at whats going on - questioning in my mind they'd remembered me - to find one of the employees spotting me, then starting my food in a panic. I acknowledged that was my pizza and I asked for a refund (I had waited close to 30 mins - and needed to get back to work) and the owner comes off the grill (bulky burger flipper) and says to me \"LISTEN! THIS IS NOT A MCDONALDS\" rudely...Btw he also suggested I come to urbanspoon (or other sites) to make a review. Good Call Bulky Burger Flipper. The point of this is I dont really care how good your food is (which it wasn't) you just cant forget and treat customers like that. I think he said his name was \"KR\". No manners, does not deserve your lunch hour.  Lucky to even have 1/5 here."}
{"text":"Not bad, but nothing special either.  They come in handy when you're out at this end of the city and looking for a late dinner."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but after several visits I probably won't be back.  I usually only do take-out here, which was fine. But when I ate in with friends or family, we were largely ignored/forgotten. I didn't mind at first but soon noticed large parties (compared to me + 1 other person usually), even if they come in much later, were served first and more attentively. Also the food started to slip in quality, items would be cold, the meat gamier, ect.  They have a wood burning oven and delicious homemade breads but the service, while not entirely unfriendly, is a deal-breaker."}
{"text":"Bad place very very rude very bad service the don't care they don't know how to run a business fuck everybody working there"}
{"text":"Delicious Döner! We randomly stopped here for lunch and it was excellent. Good bread, juicy lamb and the right kind of yogurt-based Döner sauce. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"What is going on here? Kebab 49 is really only a hole in the wall, mall restaurant, serving mediocre food, and they charge champagne prices.  A group of 4 ate pretty simply 4 months ago(see their bill in Karlas review), and ended up paying $139.00.   Maybe the owner charges depending on whether he likes you.  AVOID!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff, fast service.  The trifecta for a successful restaurant.  Have not yet been disappointed in anything I've ordered.  Some of my faves:  Lamb sandwich Ground Beef Pide Falafel Plate  We try to go there whenever we're in town, it's that good.  It's a small space though, and it gets crowded quickly.  But the food is worth it, trust me."}
{"text":"It was the worse food ever! We used to go there occasionally before they changed their location. They tried to grow by opening a better place but they dropped  quality of the service. We went there to drink kelle paca soup with a lahmacun beside it. Waited for a long time while staff were arguing with a costumer in rude manner. They didn't even listen to him! Finally when we got our soups I can say it was horrible there was no meat in the soup at all. It was full of fatty parts of the meat we couldn't drink it it was disgusting. And they said lahmacun will take long cuz there was no dough and we cancelled it and for 2 soups they charged us for $16 ! So quality is zero and opening a newer place requires some respect and training before decoration I m not going there again!"}
{"text":"worst restaurant i have ever been to, the waitress is incompetent and rude... we were a table of 8 people everyone got their food at different times.. and when we asked the waitress a question she was rude and didn't want to serve us.. I ordered the eggplant salad and the chicken sandwich.. i never got the salad and was tired of waiting over and hour so i left, and she still tried to charge me for it and give attitude i told the other staff working there she was nuts and they just shrugged... worst dining experience ever.. will not go there again save your money $20 for a plate of shawarma is too much"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Courteous staff.  Just popped in for a bite. Surprised by the amount of food you get"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to go to when I'm starving. I have been to a few Mediterranean restaurants that have very similar food with the chicken, rice, salad and bread. The food is incredible. I can't find another restaurant that's delicious as Kebab 49. The price is average, about $11 for the chicken doner. It's not a bad price considering the portions are big. The service is excellent every time I come here. I'm dying right now because the restaurant has been under construction for 2 months and I want some food!  EDIT SINCE RENOVATION: I have noticed the prices went up on most things I got before ($1-2 up) and the food is still the same quality as before. Now that the restaurant is bigger, there are more customers and less parking space. The parking is tight, so keep that in mind if you're not a good driver. If the parking lot is full, you can park at Tim Hortons and walk about 5 minutes or wait until someone leaves. I haven't actually sat down and ate there, I always got take out. The past 2 times I've been there (a week and a half apart), the debit / credit machine wasn't working. The closest bank is TD Bank on Bloor, which is about a 15 minute walk; not very convenient if you're hungry. It was a pain to leave and come back just to get cash."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to order a take out.  There are tons of choice to try but I had a mixed doner, comes with rice and salad. That was amazing, super moist, nice flavour.  My husband had Kofta..... Ummm so flavourful.  It is also cool to see their chef grilling, making dough. It feels more authenticity in the restaurant.   We are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Love it! shhhh great food, great prices, home baked pita gotta get the desert-"}
{"text":"Excellent, yummy Turkish food in the city.  I have been here twice now in two months.  The dishes are massive and I would suggest you try their meat dishes, pizza, turkish tea, kunafa dessert and some of the appetizers as well."}
{"text":"I went to this place after a recommendation from \"Turkish\" guy. Even though the food was ok, the service was horrible. We waited forever to get our main courses. And 4 more years to get the \"konafa\"!!!   Disrespectful staff and unpleasant visit."}
{"text":"Amazing food at fair prices. Everything I've tried so far has been excellent. I've been several times and only once had sub-par service but I'm going to say that was a fluke."}
{"text":"Food is ok, and the service was awful! No smile no passion, no greeting, no any service! Terrible experience"}
{"text":"I have been craving Turkish food for a long time. I didn't want to go to any restaurant with Turkish cuisine in Toronto but the one having the real atmosphere of that country with elements of its unique authentic culture.  I didn't know Kebab49 before and never heard of it from someone. In one of the weekends I was passing by the restaurant on a car and there was no way to leave unattended a huge line of cars on the parking lot in front of it. That was a sign for me to try that place once.  From the first step after I entered Kebab 49 I heard the familiar foreign language other guests were speaking. There were several tables taken but the place was not very busy that day.  We tried a lot of food: mixed pide, eggplant salad, 2 mixed kebab plates and the desert kunefe. To say that it was good is not enough. Everything was so fresh and delicious, the dishes were made exactly the way they make it in Turkey. For those who hesitate travelling so far to this country to get a feeling of it, Kebab 49 gives a great chance to experience the best food options of it. After we had a dinner the waiter gave us a complementary Turkish tea, that was a very kind jester, moreover the tea was just amazing. The staff was very friendly and attentive to us, ready to help any time.  I wish Kebab 49 had joined Just eat of Skip the dishes for me to be able to order the food at home.  I will highly recommend everyone to visit this place and will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"Love this Turkish restaurant in Etobicoke. Nice atmosphere but more importantly the food is a hit. We ordered the mix grill, the cheese + chicken pizza, the pepperoni pizza, and the chicken shish taouk plate. Let me start by saying, as far as halal pepperoni pizzas go, this is the best in Canada and US I've ever tasted. I had put off trying halal pepperoni because they always taste like plastic and smell strongly of mystery meat. I decided to give this pizza a try because it smelled good and looked safe to eat. And I'm glad I did! The bread, the cheese and the marinated meat (both chicken and \"pepperoni\") blended in perfect harmony on my tongue. The mixed grill is good enough for 2-3 people I'd say. Also their naans are deliciousness.   The place is clean and always busy so it's a nice place to go. Be prepared to wait a bit for your food, it's the only reason I'm docking a star."}
{"text":"Before they did their renovations, I always loved going here for the food and tolerated the bad service that came with it. They recently re-opened and shockingly their service is STILL terrible AND they have increased their prices. I would consider one of my top places to go to turkish food in Etobicoke as long as you can tolerate the service. Alternative if you want a cheaper option but jus as delicious is Beyti Kebab on Dundas."}
{"text":"I could not agree more with other yelpers, when they say the staff here plays favorite. I have been there twice, and both time horrible service, I ordered food to dine in,  (it was decent) and to takeout , i asked the server to add an extra bread to my order, She very rudely said \"we dont just sell bread and your order will come with one\" I said but I would like an extra one, she said no, just making a bread is too much work, i think what she tmeant to say was, it is not worth the labour... still does not make any sense.I am paying and all the do is bake bread in that oven  Like really? a custmer cannot buy an extra bread on the side? when they are making bread and pide in that big oven non stop?  I was like ok, and did not return and wont give them my business  PS. I experienced the same treatment,  people came in after me, but were served before me, also to pay I am stadning there to pay but the girl at the cash was cashing out other people  It is sad that this kind of business run in our beautiful city ...."}
{"text":"I went to eat at kebab 49 with a turkish friend and two other girls who were non turkish. The reason why I mentioned this was because if my turkish friend was not there, our server would not have understood us properly.  I think what I ordered was ok, not the greatest (I ordered kebab and eggplant) the eggplant was a bit bland...didnt really taste the salt even...but the kebab was decent.  The atmosphere was nice.  Very clean.  the restroom was clean as well (I only checked the ladies one :))  I must say though, we had a turkish dessert called Kunefe sweet cheese pastry, omg that was so delicious!!!! Along with turkish tea...oh man, I definately enjoyed the dessert and tea!!   I might try this place again if someone else goes or if one day i stop by and I want to grab something to eat as it is close to my home, otherwise ill go to another turkish restaurant.  Prices were ok... Although I don't really think kebab (about 4-5 pieces) and eggplant should  be 20 dollars.  Probably more like 15 or around that price.   Thats my opinion though!"}
{"text":"I went to this place hoping for the best since it's only a short walk from my apartment. Unfortunately it wasn't the best experience. It's a decently decorated place. The music is way too loud for the size of the place. When I wanted to order things got a bit weird. I wanted to order the chicken doner platter. The waiter seemed confused at my order for some reason even when I pointed to exactly what I wanted. I ended up getting a chicken sandwich of sorts. While it wasn't bad at all was clearly not what I ordered.   I don't think I'll go back again which is a shame . I would still recommend it for takeout though."}
{"text":"My SO is Turkish, so when he gets the hankering for Turkish food, this is the place we come to. We've always had good service, although I'll admit that might be because he speaks Turkish to the staff and they all smile and look very friendly when they are chatting away.  I've had quite a few different things to eat here. The pide is good. They have a nice brick oven they cook it in. I've also had different kebab and shish plates, and always taste what my SO orders too. The meals are huge! I usually take some home because I want to save room for dessert.  They have small, medium and large size of the künefe. It's Sooo good! You have to save room for it. And it's no good taking it home for later. Eat it when it's fresh and hot. After your meal, of course it's time for Turkish tea. Another favorite of mine.  If you want good, authentic turkish food, you'll like Kebab 49."}
{"text":"Chicken is raw and does not taste good; it was all pink and took too long to prepare. I will not be back again"}
{"text":"This is a find. Turkish delight in Etobicoke. The first thing I was impressed with was the beautiful fresh food ready to cook was displayed to make you salivate as the colours were so bright. Then the way they cook and prepare your order is all done with TLC as they enjoy what they do. The dips were perfect, the lamb was to die for, cooked to perfection.  I will continue giving them accolades as it will be a regular place to make you feel good when eating. The prices are very reasonable especially as they use fresh meat and vegetables, not frozen, and you can tell. YOU HAVE TO TRY THEM, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"Though the place is not the best one,  but the food is Great !! So far, the best turkish food in TO"}
{"text":"Food is great especially the iskander kebab with the yogurt but like everyone else has mentioned the service is horrible. Whenever we go the servers are always talking amongst each other and we have to get up and flail our arms to get their attention. Last time we had some leftovers and we waited for the server to bring us takeout containers but he never showed so my husband just helped himself to the empty containers that were stacked by our booth. From start to finish don't expect your meal to be less than 2 hours."}
{"text":"Lamb shish was not cooked properly and was hard. Chicken skewer was better than lamb. The server did not give my family water even though we reminded twice.  For the price I paid there are much better restaurant at lot less price. Overall an okay experience. Not worth the dollars spent"}
{"text":"Kebab 49 is an underrated gem of Etobicoke. I always recommend this place to friends and family. The food is always great, not too oily and they offer large portions. The ingredients are fresh and their wood stove gives great flavour to their dishes. My family visits pretty often and we love it."}
{"text":"Food is great however if you mix that with the terrible service and the constant ignoring by the order takers for simple requests like water fork napkins etc...is a turn off for me! And suddenly I'm not enjoying the good food taste anymore! This is probably the last time I'll every lay a foot in this place."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Flavourful! Filling without that lethargic feeling after. Super friendly service! I'm tempted to go back again the next day!"}
{"text":"Worst Kebabs ever!   Me and my husband were craving for BBQ  meat. We were driving after work and ended up going to this place. We ordered a Chicken Sheesh kebab. The  chicken breast was cut into humongous  pieces and was raw inside. It was bland - no salt, no pepper, no flavor. No dressing as well. Biggest turn off was the raw meat. We tried grilling it at home, didn't work. Would never ever recommend."}
{"text":"A bit pricey when compared with quantity and quality of food. Plain naan bread , nothing special about it. I had chicken kebab with rice and salad. Very ordinary food but ended up paying $15."}
{"text":"Went here for a good meal and the food was subpar for what you end up paying. When the food arrived I had a long black hair on the top of my meal as well. The staff was not friendly whatsoever and told us that the tip was not included on the bill and stood there while we finished up and waited for us to leave the tip.   I will not be back. I recommend you go somewhere else if you would like any of the food they serve here. Lots of places with better pricing and better food."}
{"text":"The service is good and the place seems a bit trendy. Cool! The food is pretty good but the mixed shawarma I had was a little dry and ordinary. The standout here though is the fresh-baked bread. It makes any sandwich much, much better! The bread alone is a reason to try Kebab 49. If I can find a tastier protein then I'll bump up the rating."}
{"text":"This is a review of customer service only, as I didn't have a chance to taste the food. I hoped to order from them for a new year's eve get together. Listed hours were until 10 PM, but I called at 11 AM to place an order to pickup later that day.  The woman I spoke to said I couldn't place an order that early, but since they closed at 6 pm she recommended I call at 5 pm to place the order. I call back at 5 pm only to be told that they closed. Perhaps they decided to close earlier, or the woman I spoke with had no clue what is happening."}
{"text":"Man oh man ....I wanna rate this place higher cause I love the food as the quality is great . The atmosphere is nice aswell .  BUT the service ...WOW the service ...... Let's just say , they have to either work on that a lot, or hire people that know how to be servers and more of them . I came here on a Friday evening ,so I understand your busy but come on.... Here's  what went down . Walk in wait 10 mins for a table. Not bad not bad.  We sit so we wait and wait 15 mins no one comes  I wave down 1 guy he comes over finally ... Takes our drink order,  15 mins later our drinks come ...yes 15 mins  Then he takes our food order 35 mins we waited to get our food yes 35  mins lol  Then we need yogurt and hot sauce should I even ask why not we ask we'll another 15 mins for that  So do the math so far I've been here waiting for food for 1 hour lol .we did eventually eat .  And like I said the food is decent ,but to wait that long just to get a drink or food is crazy ! And have  0 customer service skills is the toughest meat to chew on ! I gave this place 3 stars only cause of the food quality ...if your coming for service you've come to the wrong place for sure !!  If you have time and don't mind waiting then give them a try if you are in a rush forget it !"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites, has amazing food everything is exceptional quality and fresh I enjoy my time there always, and service is great reasonably-priced, good seating arrangements and I love the atmosphere again the food is just awesome. Give it a try, you'll love it. Friendly staff, very polite and friendly, clean, lots of seating, great for the family and kids, also good for couples looking for a nice spot to relax. And the tea! The tea is amazing, you have to try the tea. A real gem, glad I found it! Real fire cooked lamb, fresh daily."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go to!   I've been going here way before they did the renovations and it was half the size, and I'm very happy that they made it bigger to serve all of the families and bigger groups that come in. The food has always been amazing here, and I've tried just about everything on the menu.  We went here today (Sunday) randomly with my parents, and although they are super picky on food and where they eat, we all left super satisfied and happy.  We had ordered two mixed pides, iskander plate and a lamb& veal doner plate, and small kunefe for desert - And took half of everything to go! ( too much for four people!) the food was also brought out very quickly!  That is another thing that I love, is that there portions are huge and there price is fair! To top it off, the customer service was great, I have experience some bad service here before but it seems like they have changed there employees who are a lot more attentive. All friendly, smiles all around and quick assistance. I usually call in and order and take out, and in those cases too, they have made my order very quickly and several times waited for me past the closing hours so I can pick up my food! So kind! I've recommended this place to tons of family and friends and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Well I have to say I drive past everyday and today was the day I went in. No greeting, the girls working seemed more interested in texting on their phones than paying attention. I ordered a mixed donee for take out, the meat was dry with little flavour and the rice overlooked. What a shame, will not be going back or recommending"}
{"text":"Kebab 49 is one of those places I've driven by many times, but until a few days ago, I'd never set foot inside.  After choosing a nice booth near the back, we were immediately asked by our waiter if we were ready to order. We weren't, obviously, but perhaps we should've said yes since he never came back to take our order. (I waited about 10 minutes and then I finally got up and told him we were ready to place our order.)  Anyway, I elected to go with the lunch special -- which comes with a veal-and-lamb doner, a salad, and a pop for $9.99. Not less than a minute after ordering, I was presented with my salad and then a minute after that my doner arrived. Meanwhile my dining companion had to wait an additional five or so minutes for his meal. Here's a wild concept: Maybe bring the mains at the same time? Crazy, I know.  As for the food, I'll admit it was pretty spectacular. The salad was just so-so, but that doner... The meat inside there is nothing short of stellar, as it's a coveted blend of tender and crispy. It's just flawless, really. The fresh bread is a little denser than I would've preferred (ie it takes away from the flavor of the meat), and I'd just order just a plate of meat if I ever go back basically.  We waited for the waiter to present us with our cheque, but after another 10 minutes of us staring at our clean plates, we realized this guy wasn't exactly on the ball, so we just went and paid at the counter. I hate to tip less than 18% but we only did 10% and I feel that was generous.  It's a shame, really, because man oh man was that meat good. I might return to Kebab 49 again, but only to grab takeout."}
{"text":"My friend and I popped in here recently for lunch. I thought it would be more of a Paramount style where you go and order the food and then sit down. However, it has a full wait service or, if you want takeout, you can go to the counter and order. There is ample parking and the restaurant appeared to be very clean.  Now on to the food. I ordered a chicken sandwich, which was more like chicken shawarma between the most amazing bread that they bake onsite - only $7.00. The meat was so well seasoned, no fat and charred perfectly. The topping was this super fresh salad with iceberg lettuce, chopped tomato and onion in this garlicy yogurt sauce - it was out of this world delicious! I could only eat half because it was massive! My friend had something like lamb shawarma and she couldn't stop talking about how delicious it was - only $5.00. I ordered some hummus to go and they gave me a side of some other awesome bread that they were continuously baking - simply outstanding.   Here's where I deduct ONE star: there was an immense language barrier between us and the waitress, which made asking questions and ordering very difficult. I swear she spoke little to no English and I don't think she understood a word we were saying. She never smiled, we just pointed to what we wanted, she put the plates down for us (no offer for water) and we had to give her a tip. Also, not the friendliest environment; even Russell Peters couldn't get a smile out of them. They weren't rude but they certainly weren't hospitable. That being said, I would definitely go back but I would not dine in again."}
{"text":"This is my actually weekly stop over place.  So far so good. They are creating marvelous Turkish food with their brick oven and grill. Floor Manager Deniz is amazing. Tahir is the guy orchestrating the show in the kitchen. Their portions are pretty big. I never get to finish my meal. They are so welcoming, always offer Turkish tea end of your meal. Feel free to try sweets. They are good enough to remind authentic desserts."}
{"text":"I recently enjoyed a very delicious, healthy, and hearty Turkish meal at Kebab49 and will definitely keep coming again and again. I loved their flavorful and comforting Lentil Soup, a powerhouse of delicious nutrition, and was an awesome appetizer. I then savored their sumptuous Iskender Kebab Plate, which consisted of succulent, lean, yummy slow-cooked Doner meat bathing in zesty tomato sauce on a bed of torn bread (freshly baked throughout the day in a wood oven which patrons can clearly view as it is an open-concept kitchen). The wonderful food was promptly brought to my table, with a smile, in a hot plate, so the delicious meat was sizzling away. Many yummy items to choose from. Large variety. The staff are all very courteous, cheerful, hospitable, and efficient. The Turkish and Kurdish cultures are well-known for their tremendous hospitality and generosity. Very high quality food in very generous portions at very good prices. No wonder the place was packed, with many dine-in patrons as well as take-out patrons. The atmosphere is very friendly and relaxed. The interior dining area is immaculately clean and has plenty of tables. Television. Prime central location in the Dundas and Kipling area of Etobicoke, plenty of parking, close to Highways of 427, Gardiner/QEW. Literally down the road from TTC's Kipling Subway Station. Bus stops at doorstep for many frequent routes (local and express) of TTC and MiWay. My sincere thanks to the wonderful staff of Kebab49 for making my first visit a very enjoyable one and I look forward to continue dining at your great establishment on an ongoing basis. God Bless."}
{"text":"This is certainly authentic to be sure. It even came with waitstaff that spoke broken English (not a slam) who's name was Utku, nice enough fella.   The food was pretty good. I had a Greek salad w/o Feta & with what appeared to be house made salad dressing. The dressing was ok but not much taste. For the main I had the ground beef Pide. This is a basically Turkish Pizza that's kinda shaped like a row boat. It was tasty but not overly so. Didn't have cheese on it so that may have effected the taste. I'd eat this food again just not at this location."}
{"text":"I found this place by chance while driving home. I like Turkish food and when I saw this place I thought I'd give it a chance. Place looks nice for a quick food. But don't expect a  high end service. You may classify it as a caffe style service.  The staff needs a guidance because to me it seems that everyone doing everything. I had to wait a while to place an order and once I ordered hummus they brought it to me without any cutlery, right after they brought the bread they brought me the cutlery. I requests a side plate and that took forever, I personally had to grab it my self. I also had to wait for my drink for a long while, it was only 8 min but when you are thirsty 8 min will seem like 2 hrs. The bread tasted okay but if right mount of salt was added it would have been much nicer. Hummus was okay it could be better. One of the server Selma is friendly and she did accommodate a request which I appreciate very much, I wanted to taste the döner and she brought me a sample. The döner meat was actually not that bad, I would order it if I came back here again. As for my main course I got Adana Kebab or some people like to call it urfali kebab, The kebab was actually very good  Nice texture, very mild heat. The red bell pepper could have been grilled longer, salad and rice were okay. Over all they can improve the service a little more and pay attention to details. Washrooms were fairly clean, but they were low on hand soap, had washing faucet had very low water pressure and garbage was over flowing with dirty napkins. And finally most reviewers here are right if you are not Turkish you might not get a good service, I'm not Turkish and I was not entirely happy about the service.  Total cost:   Drink Hummus Adana Hst ----- $ 23.13"}
{"text":"i think this place is the best Turkish restaurant around GTA. Still needs a little improvement with their Lahmacun and some of their kebaps needs to be a little more \"Turkishy\" to be more authentic (not westernized). Ground beef kebap was amazingly good. And i can say they don't use cheap product and their meat has good quality. Overall 4.5/5 for me."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or a miss, food wise. Before ordering the doner - look at the vertical rotisserie - if the meat is thin/running out - avoid, its likely stale and yes, it does taste stale. If its stacked its fresh and you have a good doner. The price is great for the amount of food. Service, as you have already read reviews, could be improved and at times they are quite rude. You cannot order their turkish bread or lavash as takeout, even though its on the menu."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep it short. People come here to fill their bellies. Not much of a dining experience.  Nice simple decor, clean, bright. Awful acoustics; so damn loud.   The 'booths' move. There was an obnoxious group of girls sitting behind us, that kept pushing their 'bench' back , which we sat on as well but on the other side.   Asked them to cool it a few times.  They didn't listen, complained to the waiter, then they kinda stopped. Guess I'm getting old.  Ordered adana kebap with rice,salad and bread.  Rice was delis, bread too,  Salad and a drop of dressing. I asked for more.  Came with 2 kebap. One was cooked, little spice, was tender. Liked it.  Second one was Raw.   Eww.   My second star is way too generous."}
{"text":"Went to this place on May 4th. Recieved terrible service, we had to flag down the server after we got the menu as she seemed to have completely forgotten about us. Had to remind her to get us water and extra plates more than once. She never once asked us about how things were. The house hummus is nasty. It tastes just like tahini paste.  The kababs were really bland. I ordered the adana which was under salted.   Avoid this place. There's an amazing Turkish spot just a few kms east called Anatolia."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot for middle eastern / Turkish food.  The menu has a variety of choices but I strongly urge you to try any of the kebabs.   The flavour is spot on. The blend of spices, the wood fire method they use to cook gives the meat a smokey and addictive flavour.  With the kebabs served over rice, the juices spices and smokey flavour blend into the rice.   I am hungry and having cravings thinking about it.   I have eaten in and have some take out....  the place can be quite busy at certain times which is why I chose takeout.   Either way you cannot go wrong.   Enjoy and eat well!"}
{"text":"I have been there 4 times over the last few years since they opened. When they first opened, it was a small space. The food was very good. Their bread was amazing!! Over the years they expanded & the place is always crowded even on weekday evenings. Forget going there on a Fri night, Sat or Sun. It is packed!  I stopped going as they don't take reservations, you have to wait anywhere between  15-45 mins for a table most evenings & there is never enough parking spots which is so frustrating. I went there around 3 pm this afternoon. I got a parking spot & a table. I ordered their spicy tomato salad for $7 & beef kebab, 8 small pieces for $15.99! The beef was chewy & way overpriced!! I really loved their food when they first opened but I won't be going back.  Oh and if you are not Turkish, you don't get friendly service! I wouldn't waste my time going here again."}
{"text":"Great place in a great location.   Food: the food here is great. I had a \"pide\" which is basically a over cook pizza with some amazing spices. Right when you walk in, you can see all the fresh meat, and the kitchen is completely open. You can see them prepare and cook all of the food. The cheese was probably one of the freshest cuts of cheese ive had on a pizza in a long time.  Location: super easy to get to by ttc or car. Its right off the 427 along dundas, and steps away from a ttc subway stop.   Layout: the layout is great. A small waiting room for quick snacks or waiting for take out. And a very nice dining room that has long booths with very nice woodtop tables and perfrct amount of lighting.   Price: perfectly priced for what you get. It was 15.99 for my pide. And I left with a full belly and taste buds satisfied.   Highly reccommend!  -GS27"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and fresh, they make the breads in the oven. I got the Adana kebab which comes in 2 skewers with rice, vegetables and bread and it tastes delicious! All the kebabs are well made,but the only complaint I have is that the prices are a bit too much. Maybe they increased them after the renovation but a regular dish here can cost you about $17, which should be lower given other similar establishments around."}
{"text":"This food is a must try. There is a specific taste to certain foods you can mostly only find in the country it comes from. This restaurant is Turkish. I have been to Turkey and fell in love with their food preparation and taste of the meat. This place is like visiting Turkey again. Wonderful food. They prepare it in a brick oven so the underlying flavors are awesome. I thought the service was great. Its a very small place so if you need something its easy to get a waitresses attention. Kanafeh is great. Its like thin noodles baked with honey and mozzarella on the inside topped with pistachios. YUM!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. It could've been more spicy . The staff was friendly and kindly helped us. Kunefe was AMAZING. I didn't expect it to be that good to be honest. Must try."}
{"text":"I love the food in this restaurant, but will never come there again. The reason is a fat Turkish girl working there who must be a relative of an owner. She always makes a fuzz whenever I ask for just a piece of bread with a cup of Ayran, for which I of course pay a full price. Every time I ask she refuses to sell me just a bread alone (with Ayran) and keeps repeating that it's against their policy to sell their bread without a main dish, something I can't understand since they have it in abundance. She is on the phone most of the time and never listens to you when you place your order so you have to repeat a few times before she gets it. I must say that I don't have problems with other staff in this place - except for this fat Turkish girl, everyone else is nice, friendly and accommodating. I must also confess that it's really hard for me to pass this place by as the smell coming out from there is irresistible.. Please someone marry this girl and keep her home with kids so that I could start coming back to this amazing restaurant!!"}
{"text":"My lamb dinner was tasty, fresh and plentiful, great lunch spot, I would happily return for a lunch meal.  Clean inside howeve it smelt burnt and smoky which could cause problems with children or people with sensitive respatory system.  I had a sharwma which was tender juicy meat and this place is much better than other sharwma's places I've reviewed.  Service sucks"}
{"text":"Had lunch with a very good sensitive friend. He was bold and ordered lentil soup and a mixed meat wrap. He liked it a lot and felt it was good value. I ordered a dish that I will show in a photo. $14 for quality meat and generous sides. Will return."}
{"text":"I came here before their renovations for takeout which included a soup. I checked my order when I got back to the car, They forgot my soup. Went back inside to tell the lady at the counter & she started to blame me for their mistake, said soup was still to come yet failed to tell me when she handed me my bag of takeout, just let me thank her & walk out the door. What the?! told her she didn't have to be rude about it then she started to shout at me & everyone in restaurant was looking including staff behind counter. After what seemed like a dozen rude words outta her mouth one of the older gentleman workers tried to intervene & calm her down. Another worker in the meanwhile managed to hand me my soup. I thanked him & said they probably shouldn't employ such rude people especially since was her who made mistake. His face was full of embarrassment, all he could do was offer me a quiet apology as if he was ashamed of what just happened yet he wasn't about to compensate the what $5 soup to me. I wasn't looking for free food I didn't even suggest. But I am merely saying it's usually something businesses would do when it's in their error, even worse when a staff member harasses a customer. I never went back since. I've never experienced anything so dramatic ever in a restaurant or takeout. Their food is indeed delicious and even better than average but I wouldn't give them another penny because of this incident."}
{"text":"Even though the place has double the doors before entering, it was cold!! We also sat near the entrance. Should have moved somewhere else. But where we sat, we saw the open kitchen and the fire oven. It was cool to see them making some items.   Somehow they didn't have hot water for me.   The mixed kebab plate for $24 was great!! I thought it would come in two plates, dividing the salad and bread so it wouldn't get wet.   The highlight was the pita bread. It was warm and chewy!! I could have eaten more and more of this bread!!!!   The chicken breast was not dry. The ground meat skewer was my favourite. The doner/shaved meat was too dry to my liking. The hot sauce was a bonus to the meat.   So I would go back for the food alone but not the atmosphere or the service."}
{"text":"Best dürüm döner I have ever had in my life. You must try. Bir Turk olarak yedi?im en güzel dönerdi. Israr ile tavsiye ederim."}
{"text":"I LOVE the wood oven pides, especially the spinach and cheese pide.  Other items are worth trying as well!"}
{"text":"Service is poor. The other night, they ran out of both types of meat but didn't tell us until long after I received my order and my partner was just waiting and waiting for his. The food (when it's in stock!) is generally very tasty and fresh. Just avoid sitting near the front door (cold, drafty), and be aware they don't serve alcohol (Anatolia nearby has a liquor license and very, very good Turkish food, with decent service.)"}
{"text":"meh???????!.  after finding parking in the rear of the building, walked around to the front of the building and entered through the very drafty double doors i was instantly greeted by a lady at the front by the door, she didn't look like a greeter, but she asked me what i would like to go? (im not sure if i gave off that vibe, but it left me to not have to talk as much?) so i asked for two chicken Shawarma to go, she proceeded to tell me that she could make my food, but couldn't take my payment because she didn't know how to use the register...*insert confused person here* everyone here seems to have a specific job to do, i learned that after observing everyone for about ten minutes as i watched the food get made. after my food was made i went on my way outside and to my car, i instantly had one of the wraps and was left wanting more, i was not asked what toppings i wanted in my wrap and was bombarded with onions yet again.  i don't think i will be coming back here ever again due to the service, time, and frustration with the parking situation."}
